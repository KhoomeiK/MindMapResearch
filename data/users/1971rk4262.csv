Even though I was only 13 through 18, that was probably my most favorite car to drive that I ever drove, I as big as that old land barge was, I won a bunch of races in it, not to mention how smooth it went down the road."
AskReddit,ffdsyiv,t3_et0eq7,1579828144.0,"You asked for it, A little back story, Back in 1993. I had a party one night and a good friend of mine (Mike) brought another guy I had never met (James), I instantly did not like James, and he did not like me. So fast forward about two months, and I ran into James one Friday night on my way home from work. In this little town the only thing to do on a  Friday night is leave, well all my friends had left, because I was supposed to work late, but then got off early. So I ran in to James, I mentioned I just wasn't ready to go home yet, but nothing to do. He suggested I go to his place, which was next door to the convenience store we were at, and watch movies.

I thought about it, I didn't like the guy  but it was better than going home to do nothing. So I decided to go. We get there and I went to the bathroom, while he made us drinks. We picked out a movie, and started watching. I took about 4 sips out of my drink, and knew I was fucked. I tried to stand up to leave and fell flat on the floor. I was dizzy, my arms and legs were paralyzed, unfortunately I never actually lost conscience, not more than a few seconds at a time that is. I remember every ugly detail of what he did to me, I still can't discuss those things not really. I can say I thought he was actually trying to physically hurt my body.

When I could I got dressed and went home, and hid in the back of my closet over night. The next morning I took a shower got dressed and went to work just like normal, because if I didn't someone would have figured out something was wrong, because I did not miss work. Hadn't missed a day if 5 years. I didn't tell anybody for about 10 years. First as a man I could not let anyone know what had happened to me. Second I was the strong one in my friend group. I've always been a smaller man, but I've never known fear. I've went toe to toe with men twice my size without a blink of an eye, in order to take up for a friend. With that reputation how could I admit to being weak enough to be raped. I don't see things that way now, but at the time I did.

I was in an inpatient mental hospital, for a different reason, and a little 18 year old girl came in, that had just been raped by her boyfriend. But, she was denying it like it never happened, except the way she was crying. Finally I said, acting like I didn't know anything, I told her that if I as a man could admit he had been raped there was nothing that she went through that she could not tell. That did, it she finally admitted it, and made great progress to getting better. What really made me feel good though is the amount of support I got from all the straight guys there, they were wonderful, hugging me, patting me on the back, and willing to sit up with me all night to make sure I didn't get suicidal. I was really touched, that helped me heal me more than anything else could have."
gaystoriesgonewild,ff5ronc,t1_ff4mfhr,1579607622.0,"Thank You for the comment. I'm surprised at how quickly I accepted things. I mean one minute I thought I was straight and just sleeping with guys because I didn't have a girlfriend right then. But, as soon as he made that comment, the light bulb switched on, and I just knew I wasn't straight, and I was completely cool with it. I didn't have a period when I had to work out my feelings or anything, I just knew and was happy about it. Also, I've never had a problem telling someone what I thought. Not even in elementary school and facing off with a bully, I would tell them what I thought about them, and embarrass them in front of their friends, I didn't care, and still don't."
internetparents,ff1y0uh,t3_er3n9x,1579488776.0,"I don't blame you for being irritated with your mom. There needs to be some boundaries between parents and their adult children. But let me give you my story. My mom was always wanting me to sit down and watch old westerns with her, before I moved out. After I moved out she would call and want me to go to her house and watch westerns, on  a Friday, or Saturday night. I hated old westerns, could not stand them, but would occasionally watch one or two with her, just because she was my mom. I finally sat down with her and discussed it like adults, I let her know I loved her but it was a little too much. So she back off, and for several years it was great, especially after I got married and had kids, she didn't call me at all, and when I went by there she would ask me but did not push it.. Six years ago she passed away,  A couple of months ago, I sat down and watched like 3 westerns back to back, and just cried, I wish my mom was here to watch them with. 

I'm not saying don't talk to her, because you do need boundaries. You need to have your own life, just don't forget for your own sake, and hers that you humor her some and spend time with her, you'll regret it if you don't."

cars,femwrbf,t3_epsiff,1579271629.0,"Take it from somebody who drives cars with mixed tires, it's not that big a deal. Yes it can affect handling to a very small minuscule amount, no the one tire will not wear at exactly the same rate as the others, but what you are going to do find another Pilot Sport 4 with \~18000? How many miles are on the new tire? Putting another new one on the same axle, you still have one tire with XXX miles and one with 0 mile. I bought a car a few years ago, that had 4 different tires on it, they were all pretty well worn. So I drove it a couple days then on the weekend went and put 4 brand new tires on it, something I've never done. At the time there was an exit ramp that was a sharp turn, I took on my way home everyday, speed limit 30 mph, in the beginning I took it at 40mph. After the new tires, I could only take it at 25mph. There is more to handling than cornering ability, but my results were the same all the way around, the 4 mismatched out performed the new matching tires. I would not worry about it, it will not hurt your handling any, there's not that much of a difference in height, so the speedo is fine, just don't worry about that. When the older tires wear out, put a matching set on and go on. Until then, as the Godfather said ""forgiddaboutit""

what I would worry about though is that cruise. I would throw a fit until they fixed that, ain't no sense buy a car that expensive and the cruise no work properly. If it's acting up like this now, in a couple of months, maybe a year it won't work at all. Make them fix that."

ParanormalEncounters,fel4emp,t3_eoqrec,1579213819.0,"This forum is just fine. I am going to give you my opinion on your possible spirit problem. But before I do I want to say, you come here looking for help, but before telling me what your problem insulting me by calling me stupid is just really not a good idea.

Let's just start at the top of your letter, with the ""guy"" on the roof. You never saw a ""person"", just a shadow. I wish I could tell you how many shadow people I've seen. You could be right that you saw a real person's shadow, two possibilities let's add up how many items fall into each category. But back to the shadows, I've seen some shadow people that were just basic shadows, just barely a human shape. Other shadow people, are so detailed you can almost tell their hair color. But more than that I've actually seen full bodied appropriations, that looked like real people just some level of transparency. So as I said, what you saw, could have been a shadow spirit.

You said you heard footsteps and that means it's a person not a spirit. I'm guessing you don't know that spirits can manifest as footsteps. Yes spirits can make all sort of sounds and noises. footsteps, knocking, doors slamming, and all sorts of other stuff. So where your footsteps might have been a person it could also have been a spirit. Especially since I've already pointed out that some shadow people, can be just as detailed as a real person's silhouette,

It does not matter if someone died in the house or not.Some people think it makes a difference, but it doesn't. There is no bigger chance for a house to be haunted with someone dying in it than not. Maybe for a few days, but not long term. But now usually if you wake up a lot thinking someone is watching you, it's a good idea to check why. Some of it could be dreams, or nightmares, or sleep paralysis. Then again someone (real or spirit), could very well be watching you. It's hard to find out if it's a spirit, but you can find out.

If I'm picturing the house correctly based on what described, I agree it's stupid. Some things like the water heater can be explained, there was only one person living there, why should she spend all the extra to get a big tank on her very limited income. What makes me wonder ""what the hell"" is the ""Secret"" rooms with no doors. How the hell do you keep rooms hidden if there are no doors? Maybe I'm just not seeing it, I guess it's possible.

&#x200B;

>there are dripping noises with no visible source, footsteps in the attic, the crawlspace, in the little secret room at the foot of my bed, etc, people on the roof sometimes, voices, music, pets snarling into shadows and refusing to move,

Dripping noises I've heard spirits making similar noises, but I don't think I've heard that, but it is possible. I've already covered footsteps, and people on the roof. You haven't mentioned the voices, and when and where you've heard them, but voices with no known source is usually a good indication of spirit activity. Music with no known source also a good indication of spirit activity. Pets snarling into shadows and refusing to move, is usually a great indication of spirit activity. Pets do not snarl/growl/bark/meow at thin air, unless they see something you don't.

Now just so you know I am a sensitive, I can ""feel"" spirits around me, I can also see things other people do not. I can also communicate with spirits. It's kind of a telepathic thing, but it's a little different. Just because you do not believe in something does not mean it does not exist. I don't know if you have a love life or not, so I could call your love life stupid, or nonsense, just because I don't believe it exist, but that doesn't mean you don't have more dates than you can deal with. Despite you being so very rude, arrogant, and pompous and other words, I decided to help you. Just think about that next time you want to insult someone for what they believe. I'm completely ignoring the whole

I don't get offended, but I do recognize when someone is being an asshat. I only covered  whether or not there is a possibility of spirit's/paranormal activity. I did not cover the possibility of a human person being responsible. I'm in no way saying you do have spirits, just that there is a possibility. Without visiting the house, I have no way of knowing, it's up to you  to figure that out. I'll help as much as I can, but with your attitude you may never know the truth."

gay,fee45cj,t3_eog2zm,1579026015.0,"He could be bi, but not ready to be with a guy yet. I had a straight friend one time that would walk around in his underwear in front of me, hug me, grab my ass, and just flirt with me. He was completely straight, he just found it funny to tease me. I've had other straight friends that would flirt with me just to tease me, but they didn't go as far as the other guy. He knew I liked his body, so would show me his body and would laugh at me when I got a hard on and tried to hide it from him. So he could just be playing with you. 

But out of all the striaght guys I got the hots for, only one had a bad reaction when I told him my feelings for him. The rest took it as a compliment, and were honored that I felt that way, but made it clear nothing would ever happen between us. Just telling them made it easier to deal with, I don't understand why, I have my thoughts, but it never bothered them, none except that one. They trusted me, I knew it was hopeless so we went on as friends and that was that. So I don't see why you shouldn't tell him how you feel, but make it clear you understand he's straight first. Make it clear to start with that you just need to tell him, but know that nothing will ever happen. That way if he is straight and nothing will happen, he''s still comfortable around you, but if he is curious, he'll let you know. 

I did have two straight guys that I confessed my feelings too, nothing came of it, until a year later, and they decided that they wanted to find out what being with a guy was like, and I had a sexual relationship with each of them for over a year, before they went back to a woman.

She told him that he had 24 hours to change his mind or he would regret it. She called him the next day and again he said no, 2 hours later the police showed up to arrest him for molesting his step-daughter. It went to trial, and the step-daughter told that it never happened. Before the trial was over, he had ran out of money and could no longer afford his lawyer, so the lawyer quit. He was assigned a public defender, who never even opened the file, just decided my friend was guilty, he wouldn't be on trial otherwise, right? The public defender refused to believe my friend was innocent, and even said he did care if he was guilty or not, he wasn't going to fight the charges. The judge would not allow him a different PD, So my friend had no choice but to plead guilty. He ended up on the sex offender registry, and had to renew his ID every 3 months, not to mention cops had to alert every neighbor within like an 8 block radius every time he moved. Oh yeah, I didn't mention that he was in a wheelchair paralyzed from the chest down and it was physically impossible for him to do what he was accused of doing. I mean really, how was he supposed to be able to do what they said he did, when he could not get an erection? He had some shitty neighbors and some really good neighbors over the years. He passed away from cancer four months ago. I will miss him. I met him in like 1984 and we were friends until he died. Me and my son still take care of him mom, who has her own health problems. Of course we've done that for years, and he died knowing we would continue to take care of her. I tried to tell him not to worry about her, and he stopped me and said he already knew that I didn't need to say it. Sad part was a cop had to come to the hospital the day before he passed, to verify that he was about to pass before there was an arrest warrant issued for him for not renewing his S/O ID.

It could be that your friend is a small amount sensitive to the paranormal, and as a result when they walk by the WTC site, they are able to pick up on sounds and voices because they are so strong, whereas the friend might not be able to pick up on this audio in another location that isn't quite as strong. That is my best guess based on the limited information I have, and without going to the WTC site myself and observing if there are voices there or not, and without visiting other sites with your friend to see if they can pick up audio in those locations, I will never know. so take this for what it is, a guess.

OK, he has one video that's  to  hours long, and then several 1 to 5 minute videos that are just segments of the longer video. 

I'm a bi guy just so you now, and I was always told that I would never get a girlfriend until I grew up and started hanging out with kids my age. Since I always hung out with kids a year or two younger than myself. That was because they accepted me like I was, they didn't try and change me, they didn't tell me to hang out with kids my own age, we had some things in common so we were just naturally friends, they didn't make fun of me for being feminine, they didn't constantly harass me  about whether or not I was gay. They didn't bully me, and make me feel hated just for being who I was. 

At the end of my 6th grade year I begged my parents to let me go to a private Christian church school operated by my church, the next year. One, I was hoping I would not be bullied like I was at public school. Two I had been sexually active with a few guys already, and I wanted to get away from them so it would stop, not to mention the guilt I had everyday. I was suicidal. Looking back I realized this was no joke, it would not have taken much to push me over the edge, but if nothing changed I would not have done anything. I was tired of living with the pain, the guilt, and the suffering I was carrying. I hated myself, I believed God hated me.  Can't say things really got any better at the Christian school, I wasn't bullied, no body complained about me hanging out with younger kids. Nobody said anything about me being gay. Nobody but me, and I felt like God, both of us together condemned me  more than the idiots at the other school, or the adults in my life. As a condition of going to that school we had to go to church at least 2 services a week, actually the rule read 3 times a week unless there was a reason for missing, and had to have our pastor or youth director confirm we were there at least those 2/3 times a week every week, and it had to be an acceptable denomination (Baptist, Methodist, Presbeteryn, etc...as long as the church believed and preached basically what the school and the church that operated the school believed). It was very conservative, and very fundamental, so being gay was extremely wrong, so I was made to feel even worse about myself, even though no one knew anything about me. With the reasons they turned other kids away, one kid was rejected because his parents made the mistake of telling the principle during the interview that he had been caught smoking cigarettes. They were not there to reach troubled kids, they were there to keep good kids separated from bad kids.  But at least I was not bullied, that was worth the ultra Christian atmosphere, plus I hoped that atmosphere would turn me straight. 

Being bi, I did not know what was wrong with me. On one hand I was majorly into guys, and their bodies, I wanted nothing more than get guys naked. Funny thing is the more I tried to stop wanting a man, the more I needed a man (notice the use of ""wanting"" and ""needing"" a man). The more I was bullied about wanting a man, the more I needed a man, the more I prayed about God taking away my desire/need for a man, the more I freakin' needed a man. Everything I did to avoid a man, resulted in me being on my knees before a man. But, at the same time I was honestly still attracted to girls, and dated some girls, and just had some best friends that were girls. I had a large crush on a girl in our class, but I had an even bigger crush on her brother, that was also in our class. Because the school was so small, that multiple grades were in one room, our room only had like  people in it, but that was grades 7th, 8th,9th, the first year, the second and third year it was 8,9, and 10th grades. For 10th grade I transferred to a different public school. I just could not take the teacher we had another year he was just an asshole, I had also decided that if God wasn't going to fix this problem for me, I believed then I had been born bi, there was no other explanation considering how young I was when I first remember looking at guys, and the fact I did not choose to be be bi, there was no other explanation, I had to be born with what I thought was this horrible affliction. I've since learned it's not an horrible affliction, it's just who  am. I've also came to accept that God accepts me for who I am. Jeremiah 1:  [**4**](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-4.htm) Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, [**5**](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-5.htm) Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, *and* I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. When I found those verses it gave me so much strength, and so much peace, Unfortunately even though I accepted who I was, it did not stop me from turning away from God, because I still believed I could not be attracted to men, and still be in the church, so I ran from God as fast as I could, and let me tell you Jonah got off way better than I did, even as gross as it must have been in that fishes stomach, it was way worst than the places I ended up. Then eventually a few years later, when I was about 25 I heard God calling my name, and I answered, I was the like the prodigal son, I found myself living up to the waist in mud and hog slop, and whatever else was in that mud,I didn't see a port-o-potty anywhere close, and those were some big hogs. I gave my life back to Him, and even though He never promised us an easy ride, actually He talked about how hard life would be following Him, but my life has been a thousand times better with Him in my life than without Him. If you would like I would be glad to send you some verses that have helped me over the years, If you want just DM me, and I'll start sending them."
autism,fdwg5t8,t3_en5zwo,1578758324.0,"As someone whose job it was to hire people for many years, I can say that if someone told me before hand they had a condition that some would consider to be a disability, if they could do the job they applied for,, I hired them. If they couldn't do that specific job, I tried to find a job they could do. I mean if they wanted a job I tried to help them with that. Never did apply for the government subsidized programs, even though I cold have. I then tried to modify their job until they could do it. Again if they wanted to work, I tried to make it so they could. 

I'm not saying tell them, because not everyone wiill react the way I did. If you feel it will help you get the job, and you are COMFORTABLE disclosing that information then do so. But you are not required to do so. If I hired someone, and they told me afterwards,  again I reacted the same way. I could understand that they were scared it would keep them from getting hired, some people will see it as if you lied to them, and will try to find a legal loophhole so they can fire you, even though you can't fire someone because they are disabled, but if they can't do the job they can be fired,, if the miss to much work because of dr appointments, yes (although this one is tricky), I mean if you really want to fire someone you can usually find a way around laws. 

Although If you get hired and prove you can do the job, your probably safe, because they won't fire you once you prove yourself. But back to what I said, it can go either way if you disclose your situation, so just feel out the situation, how does the person doing the hiring feel about someone labeled as disabled,, what is the job, just what is your feeling about it overall? Disclosing does not automatically disqualify you, but if your situation is not going to affect how well you do the job, it's none of their business,  unless you just want to see if they are willing to make modifications to help you with the job. I know this doesn't really tell you what to do, but maybe it helps you decide what you want to do."
gay,fdwc05i,t3_en5x7v,1578757176.0,"I won't say I'm racist or not, I'll let you decide if I am or not, because most of the time I hear someone say ""I'm not racist"" it's followed by ""but"", and they prove they are racist. Back when I was dating, there was also a lot of times I wasn't looking for a date, I just hung out with friends. I'm a white guy, but a lot of nights' I either hung out and played cards at one of my best friends house, I was the only white person there, the rest were his friends family and neighbors, all black. there were nights that I went with other black friends to a black night club, I had more fun there than at the white night clubs. I had a black roommate for a while. There was a middle eastern guy,  that hung out with us some, when he wasn't with his family, they were very controlling, and two oriental guys that hung out with us. There were also several mixed race people that stopped by my house a good bit. 

My point is I didn't/don't care what race someone is, as long as their character was/is good I can like them and spend time with them. Some of my best friends have been other races, and I consider them to be family, my friend group has always been 40% to 50% non-white. But, I find myself only attracted to white guys. I'm not attracted to white guys because their race is white, I just find white skin more attractive. But, since I've never been attracted to someone of another race, I was called racist. One of my black roommates (I mention skin color in this whole post only because of the context of the thread, it's not something I do in normal life if I can find another way of describing someone. ""the guy in the blue shirt vs the black guy""), we would lay on the couch watching tv and cuddle, but neither of us got turned on. He only dated black guys, he turned down several handsome white guys, but nobody ever considered him racist. I had another white friend who would only date black guy, but that wasn't racist. A black guy that only dated white women, then there were white women that would only date black guys, again never called racist. Even though those people had a particular race they were attracted to, just like me, but I was racist because I""m a white guy that is only attracted to white guys, so I must be racist because since I don't date other races I apparently think whites are better, (which isn't true but it's what I've been told), but a black that that only dates white guys isn't racist because he can't think white people are superior to black people. A middle eastern guy that only dates black guys can't be racist because they can't think black people are better. It's a double standard and if you don't agree it's true and ok then your racist too. 

I had a friend for a while, he was black, I knew he would only date white women, what did I care if that's what made him happy. Until I heard him make the statement one day that he ""only dated white women so he could fuck a white woman and get revenge for slavery"". He didn't know I was standing around the corner. I walked around and went off. I told him how wrong he was for his attitude, and that he would always be miserable until he started dating people for the right reason. But I was told his attitude wasn't racist, even though his reason for being with a woman was to hurt her just because she happened to be white. That's racist no way around it. Being attracted to someone that happens to be a certain skin color isn't necessarily racist.  It can be. If your attracted to that race because you think that race is superior to other races, that is racist. If your attracted to a particular race because, of an unknowns reason, that isn't about the ""race"" but because of something else. I could say, I have a nipple fetish, and a white guys nipples are just prettier and more attractive to me. I don't know how big a role that plays in my attractions, but I do know I've noticed it. So it plays a decent sized part of what attracts me. I don't know what else it is that attracts me to white guys but not other races, since I have had friends of other races that I had love for, and considered family, but just was not physically attracted to. My black roommate would walk around with no shirt on, I would walk up behind him reach around and play with his nipples, but we just play flirted like that, he would walk by and slap or grab my ass, as much as we flirted like that and ran our hands along each other bodies, cuddled, kissed and even touched each other's penis's neither of us ever got turned on. It wasn't racist, it was just that we were not attracted to each other. His family called me racist because I  wasn't interested in the black guy, but no body ever called him racist for not being attracted to the white guy. A double standard. 

You are attracted to who you are attracted to, that's no big deal because that's just how it is. Don't ever let anyone tell you it's racist because of it. I mean if your only attracted to a certain race because you think that race is superior to other races, or because you want to punish that race for whatever that is racist. But if you prefer blondes over redheads, nobody gives a damn, except maybe a redhead that wants you. But let someone (even a middle eastern person) prefer a certain race and it's automatically racist, even when they don't know the reason you prefer that race, they just assume they know. You do what you want  you date who you want and don't give a damn what someone else thinks, it's your life not theirs."

I fell in love with her, and we've been together for over 20 years. To this day, I still think about men, everyday. At least once a week I seriously think about having sex with a man. If my wife said OK, I would be on Grinder or tiinder or something before she could change her mind. Until then I have no choice but to stay away from men. But it's not my choice. Well it is because I choose to stay with her despite this, but I am just as happy with her as I would be with a man, but if I was with a man I wouldn't be thinking as much about women.  

Everyone has their own story, and their own desires.  The key is you have to decide what your story is. Not that you choose to be bi or gay or straight but that you decide based on the evidence what your story is. What are your desires? Do you desire a man, or a woman, or both to some level. Imagine a line from 1 to 10, 1 to 2.0 is straight, 8.0 to 10 is gay, everything in between is bi, with 5.0 being perfectly balanced between men and women. I'm about a 7 maybe 7.5, you might be a 2.7, I don't know just saying, where do you fall on that scale? Plus keep in mind as most people will tell you bisexuality is a spectrum, it swings back and forth. One day you could prefer a woman, next day you could prefer a man, that's normal, it can be confusing if you don't have someone that can tell you it's normal, Those swings in desires can really mess you up if you don't know what to expect. Just take a deep breath, and relax. figure out what your desires and swings are, then you figure out who you are. Good Luck."

No I do not remember them all. But, I had a need for sex,  an emotional need, and a physical need, they were different but they both led to the same place, which made the body count add up quick.

It turned into one big orgy. There was BI guys, bi girls, gay guys, lesbians, straight guys and straight girls, and everything in between. Everyone became one became bi. Straight guys were doing the gay guys, and the lesbians. Straight girls did the lesbians, and the gay guys, it was great. Right as everyone finished, and leaned back against the walls and furniture to rest, the swat team busted in. The cops thought that since there was always cars from other states in the driveway I was dealing drugs. Boy were they embarrassed.

I agree completely, to a point. I haven't gamed in years but, I do remember a couple of games like this. Of course you have to understand the players in our group, we hang out together irl, and we did stupid shit in irl. But I remember one game we were supposed to flee a camp of orcs, instead my stupid self, suddenly rolled, and rushed the camp, which resulted in the other characters doing the same. The DM was going to punish us by having a dragon attack us. Somehow we managed to have some really good rolls and the DM had some bad one's. Long story short, we ended up making a pet out of the dragon. Pissed off the DM, because as hard as she tried it was not her night. But, that was the most fun we had for months. 

Another night the whole campaign ended in just 20 minutes, when all characters died, in a bar fight when we walked into a bar full of half-orc/half-elves. Of course our whole group that night were playing either elves, or half-elves. We walked in against the DM's wishes, and the DM told us what kind of bar it was, we all said ""Oh Shit"", then the melee began.

Yes this is possible, and it is not personal.

What I did figure out, even though it wasn't personal, I felt comfortable enough around person B to be myself, to show my depression.

I wold leave my girlfriends house, when her parents were not at home, and go to my boyfriends house and have sex with him. But I was straight because I was really attracted to girls. Turns out I am bi, but it's still the same, I was attracted to girls, I just never had sex with one  until I was about 26. I finally realized I wasn't straight, and that allowed me to date guys openly. But even living as a gay man (which I did for a while), I still dated women. So I wasn't gay either. But it didn't bother me, because my attitude was that I would date whoever the hell I wanted to, and nobody could tell me different. I had never heard the term bi, so I didn't know that was an option. But when I did hear the term bisexual, I knew immediately that's what I was. Until then I made excuses, but really didn't care what anybody else thought, I basically had that attitude about everything, from a young age.  But with the number of guys I slept with from 12 to 18, and still thought I was straight, with my legs in the air, I laugh now because it's funny, that I thought I was straight, just because I was attracted to girls"
internetparents,fdk0n0a,t3_elokg8,1578493100.0,"For years I worked as the person doing the hiring, and I'll tell you, if someone called me more than twice to check on their application they got the job, unless there was something there that kept me from hiring them. I had a guy one time came to me personally and said ""Look I just got out of prison, and no one will hire me because of that, but I want a job, I'm ready to go to work, should I waste my time doing an application, or move on to somewhere else"" I asked him some questions, then handed him an application, told him to fill it out right then, and bring it back to me personally. While he was filling it out, I called my boss and said ""I'm hiring this guy, and if you don't like it fire me"".  He almost did. But the passion that showed me that day, I had to hire him. He worked for me for about 3  years, he was the best employee I had ever seen. He got one promotion after another. Finally I heard from a friend their company was hiring, and I sent this guy over there after telling my friend he would be stupid for not hiring this guy. Of course he got the job. I hated to lose him, but this was the best for him, and yes I was more concerned about his well-being than mine. 

My point is, give them 5 to 8 days, depending on what day you put your application in. For instance if you put it in on a Monday, Friday is a little early but ok. If you put it in on a Thursday, wait the whole next week M-F, then call on the next Monday.  Give them time to process all the applications they get in a week, but don't wait to long or someone might call before you and get the job. Don't hesitate to call more than once.  Believe it or not, the person doing the hiring will appreciate your interest, on top of it showing you really want the job. 

BTW It gets easier to make those calls, the more you call, the easier it gets. You get used to doing it, and it gets easier. Here's hoping it won''t have time to get easy for you."

I have dated 9 women in my life, I have slept with around 150 men, I have actually had sex with 1 woman. That's my wife of over 20 years, closing in on 30. Now I still prefer men in most if not all ways. That's just who I am. BUT, I love my wife, I choose my wife, she is my everything, she is my one true love, and as a result I will never let anything split us up. So what if I prefer men, some guys prefer blonde's, that doesn't mean that he isn't just as satisfied with a brunette. 

My wife satisfies my every need. Sure I prefer men, but she still satisfies my every need. If your girlfriend is anything like me, it doesn't matter what she prefers, you are who she wants, and you will meet every need she has. She wouldn't be with you if she wasn't satisfied. 

My advice, get it together, get a grasp on yourself, and a grasp on reality, then sit down and talk to her, tell her your fears, and what you feel are your shortcomings, and let her tell you what I just did. Tell her how much you care about her, and that you want to make this work. Then ya'll work out the problems. Just remember never feel less than enough, because your more than enough."

BisexualMen,fdhv79j,t3_el42e0,1578430733.0,"When I was 3 I pretended my teddy bear was this big strong muscle man that was going to cuddle with me all night. It was nothing sexual, just laying next to a man with big muscles. At 6, my brother who is 10 years older was on the football team, and all his team mates would come over and they would lift weights with their shirts off. 

You mentioned the underwear section to look at boxers, hell I looked at the tighty-whiteys, because they show more bulge, and that was at 6 years old. At that young age I wanted to play with another guys/mans dick. Again I new nothing about sex, I just new men had a dick, and I wanted to play with it. 

So yes I feel I was born bi. I didn't start looking at girls until I was about 12, puberty age. But, I started having sex with guys when I was 12, I didn't have sex with a girl until I was about 25. I've had sex with right at 150 guys, and only one woman. I was attracted to girls, and dated girls, but sex just never happened. I was too interested in a man's body, especially the pecs since I was too young know what I was doing. I've had my pec fetish since I was about 3 or 4. I saw a guy on tv one night that had large pecs and I've been hooked ever since. I know people will say, how do you remember that, or you couldn't be attracted to men that young, you didn't know about sex. As I said earlier at that age it wasn't about sex, it was just about a man's body. I didn't start thinking about sex until I was about 10. At that age I would hope that this guy or that guy would take me somewhere private and fuck me. Like one of my brothers took me for a ride on his 3-wheeler, I could feel his crotch against my backside. I kept trying to slide back against him. We got out in the middle of a bean field, and he stopped and turned it off, I had pre-cum leaking out like crazy. I wanted him to get off that 3-wheeler and start undressing. He did get off for a minute, but he had to pee, right then I would have taken a golden shower to get a dick in my mouth."
ParanormalEncounters,fdhlafu,t1_fdh4ge8,1578425056.0,"Sometimes the best baby sitter is a protective spirit. On the other hand you don't want just any spirit hanging around the baby, that could be bad. 

Abigail loved to play games, and still does sometimes, but in the beginning she was horrible (in a good way). You never knew when she would strike. I was trying to leave for work one morning and couldn't find my keys, they were supposed to be hanging on the key rack by the front door, they were gone, I looked for a minute, then I went in the hallway, out of the living room, that was the important part, you could not be in the room where she needed to return things, I don't know why that was just the pattern I figured out. Anyway I went in the hallway, and said ""Abigail, I'm late for work, can you please give my keys back, and I'll play with you when I get home"", counted to 5, went back and there were my keys hanging right were they were not 30 seconds ago. When I got home I played with her, just like I promised. My wife gets aggravated at her sometimes now because she'll decide to hide something, or move something, or whatever. 

That's the good side of having a spirit around. But if you get the wrong one, you can regret it. Just wait and see if your spirit tries to communicate with you. They won't be able to talk, but telepathy can be possible depending on the person. Some people can, some can't, you'll just have to figure out how to talk to your spirit. But, please do not initiate any communication, let the spirit do that. Otherwise your invitation to speak, will just go out to every spirit close enough to hear, and will invite them in, and you will end up with a bad spirit attached to you. Your safe if the spirit initiates it, but not if you do. Unless you have a communication history with a specific spirit. Good luck on the baby. Really having a spirit watching your baby can be wonderful, the spirit can and will sit on the bed and rub their back, or head to comfort them, and will fight like a pit bull to protect the child. Somebody break in and try to touch the baby, they will find diapers, and rattles, hard toys, and anything else in the room, upside their head. Just imagine you break in a house and go to touch the baby, and a dirty diaper flies up out of the trash all by itself and lands on your face, will you try to touch the kid again? 

I wish you the best, don't forget any friendly spirit in your house, all you have to do is say ""any spirit in this house it's not personal but please leave"" or something like that, just be polite, and they will, protective spirits there for a reason, will give you some argument, it's up to you to decide what you want to do in that case. Bad spirits, you'll need to sage the house, everything can be found  on Google, unless you have an occult shop where you live.  depending on how bad the spirit is you may need to call in a professional."

MarriedAndBi,fdgxnf4,t3_el9rmc,1578410852.0,"Your post is not long, don't worry. All, I'm going to say is that I think you have a great beginning. I see nothing wrong with you or your husband or both having someone on the side, or doing a threeway if that's what you want. Just make sure all parties, especially your husband are ok with what is happening. If he can handle the emotional stuff with having you sleeping with someone else, then go for it. Just make sure he is also allowed to have a side person, if he wants that. I don't understand why people can't handle having their spouse having a side person. Too me it's natural to have more than one sexual person. To me it's not natural to be monogamous. Unfortunately I married a woman who said she was completely ok with who I was, she even bought some toys and video's to match what my life had been before her. She discussed people we could talk to about being part of our sex life in some way or another, even naming names. Then due to a long story I don't want to go into right now, she suddenly changed, she became very possessive of me, any playtime was out of the question, she threatened to leave  me a couple of times over stupid shit. I wasn't even talking about doing something or even thinking about anything. In her defense there was a very good reason for her change in attitude. I don't really blame her, for getting her feelings hurt, there was no reason for her feelings to get hurt, but the way she saw things it's understandable. I don't agree with what she thinks she saw, because she saw it wrong. But I do understand her seeing it the way she did, and don't blame her for seeing it that way. But it still pisses me off, she refuses to reconsider, and is being very unrealistic with things. So I will be monogamous the rest of my life. I may not be happy about that, but she is the love of my life and I will not hurt her, and I will definitely not  lost her."
ParanormalEncounters,fdgvcq0,t3_el5yl5,1578409248.0,"Yes, I have told my story a good bit here. But first let me give you a little background. After a paranormal encounter when I was 12, I have been a sensitive, years later I developed some abilities of a medium, but I don't consider me a medium. Anyway I've talked so several spirits over the years and this is what they've all told me. First there are no human spirits. When  a human dies their spirit immediately crosses over, there is no chance for them to get stuck here, or choose to stay, they are just gone. Now there are several other types of spirits here. There are Good or Friendly spirits, I call them friendlies, there are bad/evil spirits. Imagine a straight line with numbers on it from 1 to 10, 1 being friendly, 10 being evil, then you have those in between. Although I can walk in a building I can tell if there are spirits there, and if they are good or bad. There is no way a spirit can hide if they are bad. I know that vibe anywhere, so even though there is a scale, a spirit is still either good or bad period. They might fall at 6.1 which is bad, but they aren't that bad. Then there are also Angels and Demons. I won't take the time to explain all that , but there are different types of angels, and different types of demons, I'm just not going to explain it all right now. 

Now, you had asked about anyone experiencing a playful spirit. Yes I did. I'll make this as short as I can.1993 I bought a house, shortly after moving in, I was watching tv one day, I changed channels then put the remote back. I had a little wooden organizer I kept the remote in. So a few minutes later I decided that I really didn't want to watch that, so I reached for the remote. It was not there. I know I put it back. But it wasn't there, so maybe I carried it in the kitchen when I went for a drink. Wasn't there, or the bathroom, or bedroom, or spare room or anywhere else. I walked back in the living room, and there is was right where it was supposed to be. Next day it was my keys. Then later that day my cigarettes, a cooking spoon, a can of Dr. Pepper, and other stuff. My friends were making so much fun of me. Then one day it happened to my best friend with her cigarettes. Eventually all my friends were affected, it just seemed the spirit had to get to know someone before they would play with them. But eventually it turned into a scavenger hunt. We found the remote under my waterbed matteress, my keys in a box in the closet of the spare room, under three other boxes. I finally saw the spirit one night. I got out of bed to go to the bathroom, stepped into the hallway and there she was. She could answer yes and no questions, I named her Abigail, I had never heard the name a Abigail before so that was strange. Many years later, things developed so I could communicate with her telepathically, and found out he name was actually Abigail, she had managed to give me the name telepathically that first night, despite how hard it was for her. 

After being able to communicate with her, I found out that she was a protective spirit and had latched on to me because at the time I needed the protection, as I was very active in the paranormal world. But it is now 2020 and she is still with me in a way. I don't communicate with her very much anymore. But she is protecting and comforting my 14 year old autistic son.   We have 5 spirits in this house all good, but it seems we are a crossroads or something and we do have bad spirits come through. The spirits that 'live"" here, just exist. We hear them talking some nights, they will turn the tv on or off occasionally. They walk around, we have a light that is a motion light, they turn it on just because, they love to open the back door to let the dogs out. The dogs used to bark and growl at them, but now consider them part of the family. But, Abigail is always in my son's room if a thunderstorm scares him, or if a bad spirit comes through. I  am so comforted knowing she is watching over him. I saw her in action protecting me a couple of times, I know he is safe with her around. You say you don't want your spirit following you when you move, you might want to rethink that. Don't try to communicate with the spirit that can invite other spirits in. But get to know your spirit, why is it there? Is it attached to you or the house? If it tries to communicate with you, then find out what you can. If it's a protective spirit, then allow it to stay, or even go with you when you move. Otherwise do not let it go. 

Your spirit sounds friendly maybe even playful. If it wants to play, enjoy it If it's not a protective spirit, you can tell it to leave, and it should do as you say. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.....LOL"
GayChristians,fdgp0u7,t3_ekx3ln,1578404478.0,"When I first came out, I left the church, just seemed like the thing to do because you know the church doesn't approve of homosexuality. Of course my dad had to go before the whole church more than once asking them to pray for me since I was gay (actually bi, but you know what I mean). Anyway about 10 years later, due to a long story I don't want to go into, I had to move back into my parents house. But, the only way my dad would allow me to move back in, was if I went to church. So I walked in to this very conservative, very fundamental, Independent Baptist Church in the south. On the drive I was preparing myself for the abuse I would get.

I walk in, and immediately 100 people come running up to me, for hugs (even the guys), or handshakes. You have to know that my parents were going to that church before I was born, I spent the first 18 years of my life in that church, I had grown up with these people. There was so many people that were my age, then most of the older members, had babysat me, the younger one's had heard stories from their older siblings. So they were glad to see me again. But, everyone was glad to see me, I did not get a single negative comment. The people were just as warm and inviting as I remembered. Despite knowing about my sexuality, no one cared, They all just wanted to catch up, they were telling me about what had happened to them, and asking about what I had been through. Of course there was very little I could tell them. Although a couple did ask about my romantic interest, and if there were any men in the picture. They were willing to have my boyfriends come if there was one.

I was extremely shocked they they were being so good about things. Then again knowing those people, they were being genuine, all of them are just naturally that friendly, they were not putting on just to make me feel comfortable, They really do care that much, so I shouldn't have been surprised. A few months later the pastor was preaching from a section of Scripture that contains a few verses that is considered against homosexuality. When he got there, he read the verses, talked about how they condemn homosexuality, and then read the verses against divorce, and same thing preached against divorce, and adultery. What I'm saying is  he didn't shy away from the topic of homosexuality because I was there, but he didn't go overboard trying to put me down, he found a good balance. Same thing with all the other topics, there was a lot of divorced people in the congregation, But that didn't stop him from preaching against it, but he didn't condemn anyone either. I couldn't be mad about him using that section of Scripture, it's in the Bible, but he took me into consideration. He handled it very well, doing what God wanted him to do, without alienating me. How can you be upset over him just using the Bible for his sermon. Especially when he took my feelings into consideration. The official stance of the church is that homosexuality is wrong, and you need to repent. But in real life, their belief is to accept a person no matter what. Then allow God to convict the heart, that's God's job the church members job is to love the person no matter what, and to accept them no matter what. After I rejoined the church, we had several other gay people come through, including one gay couple. They were were invited to join the couples class, that is where they belonged not the singles class they were going to. It's all very normal. Nothing fake with those people, they really are that loving."
ParanormalEncounters,fdgmpck,t3_el1biw,1578402468.0,"Yes, back in 1993 (or give a year or two), I bought a house, shortly after moving in I had objects disappear, then reappear 15-20 minutes later in it's original spot. Then things started going missing and we had to do a scavenger hunt to find them. when I say ""we"" I mean me and my friends, as I was single. But the spirit had to get used to someone, and feel comfortable with them before interacting with them. But, a couple of months later, I actually got to see her. I told her that as long as she was friendly she was welcomed to stay. We all even enjoyed her little games so that wasn't a problem. As long as she respected us, we would consider her part of the group. I could talk to her and she heard, but she couldn't talk back, but did answer yes and no questions, eventually we were able to communicate both ways, but anyway, since she couldn't tell me her name I asked if I could call her Abigail, she smiled and agreed. She would materialize on command, when she could.  There was about 10 or 15 maybe 20 people that she had interacted with and showed herself to. 

There was on time there was two guys that wanted to join our friend group. None of us wanted to associate with them, so we cooked up this plan, and invited them over and made sure they sat in a certain spot, there were 10 other people in the room at the time. We knew they were afraid of ""ghost' so they got there, and a few us had already talked to Abigail, so the trap was set. When the boys had been there for about 10 minutes, I told them, oh, you haven't met Abigail yet have you, they said no, and I turned around and said ""Abigail come  here"", she materialized in front of the boys. They jumped up, and ran out of the house, almost taking the door off the hinge's literally. Cost me $150 to fix it, it was worth it.  Jumped in the car and smoked the tires leaving. That's when we realized they had both peed themselves and my couch. I had to have the cushions dry cleaned.

I later found out that Abigail was her real name, and that she was a protective spirit. The thing is it's  2020, and she's still with me. I don't see her as much as I did , but she let me know that she's still around and watching me. When we moved in this house she let me know the 5 spirits already here are friendly and nothing to worry about. But more importantly she is watching over and comforting our 14 year old Autistic son. He has a speech delay, and can't speak very well, but he will tell me about Abigail sitting on his bed at night when he gets scared. It's funny, he can't lie. I mean he physically can't lie, because of his speech delay, if he tries to lie, his words get scrambled, and all he can do is mumble, but it's  a different type of mumble than he usually does, so we always know when he's trying to lie.  He's never heard me talk about her, but he can describe her perfectly, and after  he told me about his first encounter with her, we were having a thunderstorm, lots of extremely loud thunder, so he went to peek out from under the blanket and look out the window, he saw her standing there, and was terrified, until she walked over and sat on the bed, and he immediately felt good, rolled over and went back to sleep. I called out to her, and asked her if she was watching him. She said yes. Made me feel comfortable knowing that she was watching him. She protected me from so much, I know she is capable of keeping him safe."

There were times I slept with 4 to 14 yes 14 men in a 24 hour period. There were also the cars, as a single man I always owned at least 2 cars, for 6 months I owned 8 cars. Because I was manic and I bought cars when I was manic. My credit was good enough, and my income was good enough I could swing it.

But just because it's normal doesn't mean you have to put up with it. That doesn't mean you can't be mad about it. You have every right to be mad, and to be hurt, I'm telling you as a bipolar man, I'm telling you do not let anyone tell you that you don't have that right, just because he's sick and didn't know better. Yes, because he is sick he deserves to have that taken into consideration, and that goes to him being forgiven. But you are just as important as he is. The key is to find a fair balance between your needs, and his needs. That's not always easy, but I have to say my wife has been wonderful dealing with my bipolar. It can be done, but not always easy. This isn't advice, it's just what has worked for me/us, maybe some of it will help you. I hope it does, your in a bad situation. You just come and vent all you need to."

I saw a pickup loaded with firewood, rear suspension flattened out, I'm talking bushiing to bushing, caught the rearend on an oak tree stump about 1.5 feet across, he pulled the stump out of the ground, that engine did not know how to stop pulling with the torque it had. Take any of the above cars and smoke the wheels without using the brake. I've seen one run dry, fixed the hose, filled it back up, and put another 100k on it. One guy ran his dry of oil, put a new valve cover gasket on , filled it back up and drove it another 100k. For a small V-8 good power, good torque, in a non-killable package, it was the ultimate engine."

ParanormalEncounters,fddafqt,t3_ekq0eg,1578302484.0,"Here's an idea, understand I said idea, I'm probably wrong, but if it' been with you that long, and it has never tried to scare you, just watch  you. Until the other night when as you said ""the air felt heavy and my heart was in my throat"", after the change in atmosphere, something touched you. Could it be this is a guardian angel? Or just a protective spirit? I have a protective spirit that has been with me since about 1994, moved around with me, stayed with me after I got married, and is now comforting my Autistic son when something strange happens in our haunted house. The spirit is nonverbal, but I named her Abigail it was the first thing I thought of, and when I asked if I could call her that she smiled and nodded her head yes. I don't see her as often these days, but she's always around, I feel her more than I see her. And as I said this house is haunted. One night we had a really big occurrence, I actually had to get up and yell stop, and threaten to expel every spirit here. Right after everything calmed down, it had been going on for about 10 minuets. I was in the kitchen getting a glass of water before going back to bed, and my 13 y/o Autistic boy with a speech delay, the kid can not physically tell a lie, every time he tries to lie, all he can do is mumble, and it's a different mumble than he normally does, but he walks in the kitchen, gives me a hug and ask if it's over, I say yes, go back to bed, he says Abigail says hi. I shook my head and said ""WHAT"", he said ""Abigail says hi"". I asked him very intrigued since he doesn't know an Abigail, he says ""yeah I woke up and saw this woman (and described Abigail) by my window, then when it got loud she sat on my bed and played with my hair until you made the noise stop she made me feel safe"" I said ""yeah son, that's what she does"".

Maybe the night he touched you, was because there was a bad spirit in the house and he wanted to make sure where you were and that you were safe. Then again he may not have been there, and you were touched by the bad spirit, to leave it's mark on you to tell your protector that he wasn't doing his job, and you could have died. I'm just trowing out ideas. I do feel strongly about the protector spirit, the black mass you described is not usually a protector, but everything else you have described does. I'm a sensitive, and I've ran across a lot of spirits in my time, I've seen plenty of protector spirits, if you have one be glad, but be aware because you only get a protector if you need one, which means something could be stalking you. Although the protector is one tough SOB, and can handle most anything, or can call in backup if he needs it, so your safe, just be aware of what's going on around you.

Just wanted to add that all the spirits we have in this house are friendly, I don't know backgrounds yet, but I do know the family of the previous owners have owned this land this the early 1900's or before, and the whole family has been outlaws, moonshiners, bank robbers, kidnappers, murders you name it. But all of these spirits are good natured, they just got a little wild that night, never happened before, and will never happen again, I've told them as long they are friendly we don't mind them being here, but if they ever cross the line, I will expel them, if they get wild and start causing confusion in the house, they are expelled. We don't mind them playing games with us from time to time, Abigail especially loves to play hide and seek with objects, but they can not disrupt our routine. But we are 100% safe, as a sensitive I can feel if a spirit is good or bad, and there is no mistaking it, the vibe they give off can't be hid. They can't pretend to be good if their not."

If she is familiar with the story of the Centurion's servant Jesus healed,  it is possible the centurion and the servant were gay lovers, and Jesus said the centurion had more faith than the rest of Israel combined. So there is hope, we just have to hold in there. Tell her to be happy and check in with us. I don't know if those claims are correct or not, but they've been made, and I like the sound out it."

You can get a lot of good help there, most of us are more than willing to talk privately if you want, but go look and see how many other guys either feel or have felt the same way you do. But there are a lot of reasons not to completely trust the church, or even the Bible. As I believe there have been a lot of mistakes in translations and such. For example in the Old Testament where homosexuality is called an abomination, the original text are actually talking about how in the pagan temples of the Amelikites, they had male slaves forced to work as prostitutes, that is what God called an abomination, not a loving committed gay relationship. Then look at Jonothan and David, if they weren't a gay couple I don't know who was. The Roman Centurion, who came to Jesus to heal his servant. That was in the Roman word a ""pias"". A pias is a teenage boy used for a sex slave by officers on the battlefield, since women were considered to be bad luck on the battlefield. So when Jesus said he had never found such a great faith in all of Israel, He meant that a gay man had more faith than all the Jewish leaders in Israel. Then he healed a gay slave. When you can find someone that goes back to the original text and re-translate correctly, it's amazing what you can find out. I'll try to look up all those references, I've had a computer crash and lost all my references to this and I haven't had time to look it back up, but if you want I will get it looked up asap."

I heard the clickclickkcklickikik, and jerked it back into drive. I drove it another 4 years and 150K miles, and never had a problem out of the trans, and that was 45 mph to park.

Well maybe not that many but you get the picture. The thing we both knew it was a one time thing before it happened, I was the only guy they would ever consider being with, then the most important thing, they were never attracted to a guy before or after, it was just a way to get their rocks off, one time.
