Usually in the form of ""I played a few RPGs with quests or choices or menu boxes! That means all games with any one of those things are RPGs!""

The proof is right in the fact that-- if you read the comments here-- a lot of people are commenting giving their arbitrary definition of ""RPG"" and all are wildly different. This is how it's been every time I've brought up this subject."
unpopularopinion,feypvdr,t1_fex9mw7,1579448992.0,"I have been over this a million times with a million people already, but... Your entire argument is completely arbitrary and doesn't hold up for even a minute to scrutiny.

>I feel lke a ""pure"" RPG is a game where youre choices have an influence  on the story or your character, and that different outcomes could happen depending of thoses choices.

**Games that fit your description but which nobody thinks are RPGs:** Sam & Max, The Stanley Parable, Shadow the Hedgehog. Potentially any game with multiple paths or endings. Technically even a game over is a change of story.

**Games which don't fit your description but which are clearly considered RPGs:** Most JRPGs including Final Fantasy. Kingdom Hearts. Pokemon. Zelda isn't an RPG, but even it doesn't have varied story outcomes due to choices.

Everything else you said after that is equally arbitrary. And finally, just remember the one rule: Game genres are not defined by their writing, but by their gameplay. That's why they're *game* genres.

&#x200B;

>Zelda is an action RPG, because you have some parts of a RPG like  leveling up, gearing up, discovering a story, interacting with NPC,  etc... But you don't have a lot of control on the story. So in this way  it's more ""follow the line to discover the story the dev have made and  battle the foes they put on the way"".

1. You don't level up in Zelda (except for II).
2. You ""gear up"" in Mario or any shooter with a custom loadout.
3. Most games have you ""discovering a story"". Or are Kirby's Adventure, Mega Man X2 and Sonic Adventure RPGs now?
4. NPCs are in many non-RPG games. Or are all point-and-click games RPGs now?

What you are partially confusing with ""RPG"" is ""adventure game"". It's an extremely common mistake, but it's a mistake nonetheless. It's because of association assumption. That is, you see some element in a game you call an ""RPG"" and you assume any game with that element is an RPG. Mostly those elements however are ""adventure"" elements-- as most RPGs are also adventure games. Final Fantasy XIII is an ""RPG"" with no ""adventure"". Zelda is an ""adventure"" with no ""RPG""."

Is every single-player Final Fantasy game not an RPG now? You don't customize their appearances, dialogue, goals, personalities-- nothing.

Don't put the blame where it doesn't belong. The real reason for the failure of the Wii U was two-fold:

First, Japan's sequel-, addition-, and extra-naming culture consists of naming most things ""Z"", ""X"" (or ""cross""), ""G"", ""zero"", ""R"", ""DX"", ""GT"", ""GX"", ""GTX"", ""EX"", etc.. If not that, then often ""Super"" as a prefix or suffix. (""Dragon Ball Z"", ""Dragon Ball GT"", ""Dragon Ball Super"", ""Mega Man X"", ""Mega Man Zero"", ""Mega Man ZX"". ""Xenoblade Chronicles X"", ""Sonic X"". ""Sonic R"", ""Super R"", ""Bomberman R"". ""Sonic Adventure DX"", ""Link's Awakening DX"", ""Pokken Tournament DX"", and on and on.) If that works for Japan, then whatever. I think it's stupid, but whatever. However, it *doesn't* work for the rest of the world. The rest of the world will just be confused. And Nintendo needs to worry about the rest of the world if they are going to make a profit. So the Wii ""U"" failed in part to a dumb Japanese sequel-naming cliche. If Japan hired a marketing department instead of being dense and insular, this probably wouldn't have happened. And guess what? They still don't know what they did wrong, and will probably never come to terms with it.

Second, apparently tons of actual Nintendo fans didn't buy the Wii U. Whenever I ask why, they never gave me a straightforward or logical answer. I just think they decided the Wii U wasn't cool enough for them, which is bullshit. Furthermore, these people also praise the Switch like it's some kind of masterpiece-- and it's not. The Switch was rushed out to make up for the lack of Wii sales, and therefore had/has unrefined, easily-broken hardware, bad main menu organization, and extremely little new game support on launch. It was (and partially still is) a glorified port and ""deluxe version"" machine. And while that may be fine in and of itself, it is nothing to worship the Switch over.

The only people who argue for death penalty are emotional people who want revenge. They are the same people who-- consciously or subconsciously-- think ""only criminals end up in prison, and criminals aren't people"", and hence the reason why everyone who goes to prison is forgotten. Now, the lives of the free are not affected by the imprisoned person whether that person has life in prison or is given the death penalty. So there is nothing to gain by the death penalty-- just a feeling of misguided ""justice"". However, if you fuck up by executing an innocent person, there is no taking that back. You ended a \*life\*. Now what if it was you? It's your \*life\*. All of that gone. The end of you and all your thoughts and dreams, and then the suffering of your friends and family. Would you be okay with that? What would you be thinking and feeling if you were sitting there about to be wrongly executed? Is that just? And for what? Because some revenge-loving people decided life in prison wasn't good enough and that the chance for the innocent to be exonerated wasn't valuable? People who advocate the death penalty don't know how to put themselves in others' shoes. They lack basic empathy. They forget that other people-- even people labeled or convicted-- are humans too.

""But I am not them! It would never happen to me!"" Or ""But their crime was so obvious and there was so much proof!"" It really doesn't matter. Those who mistakenly execute actually-innocent people are just as sure and ready to do so as they were to execute the truly-guilty. If you give people the power to execute others, they *will* make mistakes, and most will abuse that power at some point. People want to ""get"" people-- they don't even care if they got the right person. They'll put it out of their minds and won't want to question their decision because they want to feel good, not bad. We have seen plenty of studies and observations of this behavior.

Listen, and listen well: anyone who says that it is okay to risk sacrificing the lives of any innocents at all in order to get revenge on another is being evil. Villainous. They are *the pitchforks and torches*. And when has pitchforks and torches ever been good? To allow them to have their way is to allow ignorant people to do terrible things out of anger and fear. There is no justification of a person's ignorance when they accidentally sentence an innocent person to die. They have already done irreparable evil. A good person acts in kindness to those who are good *or* evil, well-adjusted *or* struggling. Prison is a necessity to separate harmful people from others. But murder of the convicted is not a necessity-- it's an evil, emotional wish."

todayilearned,fc5xzgq,t1_fc5tpxp,1577468232.0,"The death penalty *is* inhuman. For every person that you think deserves it, there are tons of people who do-- or potentially will-- get it *who didn't do anything wrong*. You have to understand that once you give people that kind of power (the power to give the death penalty), they will seek to use it-- justly or unjustly. People just want to ""get someone""-- they don't even care if it's the right person. This has been proven and observed so many times.

Please understand what people do when they have power."
