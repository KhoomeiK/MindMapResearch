As the “fire cooper” train conductor, I’ve definitely cooled on it. Some of our losses haven’t been fun, but we looked to be playing the right way for a while before the break. Despite the recent wins, it seems like we’ve regressed towards 18-19 Lightning tendencies. I’m hoping we can break out of it.
