*  2 tbs brown sugar
*  2 tbs lemon juice

Bring the dates, coffee, sugar and lemon juice to a boil then add the soda.  Stir and mash with a wooden spoon (so, my aunt and every recipe call for the use of a wooden spoon - and I don't actually know what would happen if you didn't use one).  Make sure there are no left over date pits.  In about 5 minutes it should become very soft and spreadable...like the inside of a date square ya know.  Anyhow, it's done when it's like that.

Crust and Topping:
*  3/4 cup vegan butter or margarine (I used Becel vegan here)
*  3/4 cup brown sugar
*  1 cup flour
*  1 3/4 + 1/4 cups oatmeal (I like the chew of large flake)
*  1/4 tsp baking powder
*  1/8 tsp cinnamon
*  Feel free to add in a couple tbs of triple mix (chia, hemp and flax) to your crust mix, and call this a super food, because it wont taste any different, but it will make you feel less guilty when you eat half a tray.

Mix that all up (reserving 1/4  cup oats).

Line an 8x8 pan with parchment, leaving wings on the sides (to help you lift it out later).  Grease the 2 sides with no parchment.  

Press half the crust mixture into the bottom.  Spread the date mixture over that.  Then crumble the other half of the crust/topping mixture on top and press down gently.  Sprinkle the rest of the oats.

Bake at 350 for 45 mins or until golden brown.  Let cool before removing from the tray.  Or don't.  I didn't.  But I guess ideally you should.

My friend had a 7cm tumor in her brain.  For months she could not get quick attention for it and she was on a regular list to get an MRI.  On the week she was diagnosed, she passed out from pain and went to the ER.  She was immediately given an MRI.  She was sent home from the imaging department to wait, and the Doctor called her and told her to meet her in the emergency department of a bigger hospital.  They admitted her there, and he reviewed her results with her.  He told her she could either a) check in as an emerg patient and get the surgery the next day, or go on the list, which could take weeks.

It's more the raw bud that smelled weedy....the baking made a smell, but not the same smell as, say a joint.

This is what I do :)

CanadianMOMs,fe6ela8,t3_enx8v1,1578888594.0,"I HIGHLY recommend making your own edibles.  It's so easy, and cost effective, and you can make big batches and freeze them, so once you try one or two times to get your ""dose"", then you'll still have a ton left over to use normally.  1/3oz quality bud should give you over 100 doses.  That is so cheap."

* 1 large white onion or 2-3 cooking onions, chopped
* 2 large carrots, washed and chopped
* 1 celery stalk, washed and chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, cut into 3
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp liquid smoke (if you dont have this, you can use 2 tbs of simulated bacon bits (like the ones from the prepackaged caesar salad that you thought were shitty before you went vegan, but now they are f'acon heaven in recipes)
* 9 cups of liquid (I used 5 cups of vegetable broth and 4 cups of water - I'd keep it a similar ratio but you could easily use a 1L carton of broth and 5 cups water)

I put this all in my InstantPot and put it on Pressure for 15 mins (which I do because the IP switches to Keep Warm after, so I can just leave it until I'm ready to blend it), but you could also boil it in a pot on your stove until everything is soft.

Once everything is cooked, blend until smooth, return it to your cooking vessel and add pepper to taste.  Or put in in a crock pot for later if you cooked on the stove.

Total prep and blending time is less than 15 minutes.  Even on the stove you could have this delicious, hearty soup done in less than 45."

UnethicalLifeProTips,fd5r7jz,t1_fd5q7fr,1578180580.0,"? In Canada?  At my local Emerg, you would get an MRI if you needed one coming in for an Emergency reason.  

My friend had a 7cm tumor in her brain.  For months she could not get quick attention for it and she was on a regular list to get an MRI.  On the week she was diagnosed, she passed out from pain and went to the ER.  She was immediately given an MRI.  She was sent home from the imaging department to wait, and the Doctor called her and told her to meet her in the emergency department of a bigger hospital.  They admitted her there, and he reviewed her results with her.  He told her she could either a) check in as an emerg patient and get the surgery the next day, or go on the list, which could take weeks.  She did her entire diagnoses and surgery as an Emerg patient."
