PcMasterRaceBuilds,ff0yiuc,t3_er1qn2,1579473522.0,"Great list, but I would probably aim for a newer Ryzen generation, and then benefit from some faster ram.

Also you only need a crapton of SSD storage if you do rendering and a lot of graphical work, so unless that’s a requirement, get an HDD for mass storage.

Lovecraft,fdqqv8q,t1_fdqp28v,1578672931.0,"Most of the stories usually conclude with revealing that unthinkable myth actually exists in depths yet undiscovered. And I think that merely creating an abstract representation of the Old Ones would be too.. Well.. Boring. The entire suspense - at least in my opinion - is released as horrors that are merely hinted at through the entire story, is finally revealed to not only be an archaic series of myths, but very much real and waiting.

It would also - in my opinion - be a wonderful nod to the old genre of horror, where the suspense builds up and finally rewards the viewer with a brief glimpse of the embodiment of the terror.

EDIT: But I think your points are great none the less!"
nvidia,fdqc6sl,t3_emlk5j,1578662692.0,"I love it. Also that CPU cooler heatsink is chonk af. I heard that you can mitigate some of the GPU sagging by tightening up the power cables to act as support, they should be rigid enough to hold a bit of weight without being stressed."
Lovecraft,fdq5k1e,t3_emhbqp,1578655821.0,"The issue that I personally find with adapting Lovecraft stories, is that they are mostly told in the form of a first-person narrative, based off “journal entries”. It works so well, because he faithfully conveys the sense of dread that the characters in his stories re-experience as they recollect the memories.

I don’t know if it can be done properly, but an adaptation in the form of a first-person POV, a bit like Cloverfield, where the monster in question is never truly revealed, but just hinted at, or seen in panicked glimpses, would probably be the most viable version to catch the true spirit of a Lovecraftian story."
