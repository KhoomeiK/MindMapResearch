Trailers and catering truck and around and sign pointing where the set and holding areas are everywhere. Sometimes you see the nypd city permit sign with the production name and what movie or show is being filmed in some cases if it's a major film they just provide the code name to no bring much attention  but even then no NDAs given. Only thing I could think of are for the extras that they use as they are sometimes from the neighborhood and they might make them sign one."
