depression,fbvrspe,t3_eeh20j,1577135138.0,"I had to understand that I can't expect people to get me. They just don't know how to handle it and it is not fair for me to expect them to understand. I don't let my family know about my issues because I've tried to speak up and sometimes it helps when they try to help, bit there are times where I had to sit with the issue myself and resolve it however I can. 

In my community, people don't take depression seriously. They mostly think you shouldn't have anything to worry about. But overtime I learned that the people who think this way, hide alot of what they are going through. This is why when you bring your side - they have no tolerance for it. They don't want to deal with it because they have enough of what they're going through."
