Christianity,ffa89kq,t1_ff8ycbu,1579729814.0,"You made me look at the rules...

You misquoted ne by making it look like said ""is that really what you think jesus would do""

A little deceptive as that was not what I said..

When what I did was quote what Jesus said, and asked if doing the exact opposite was right if the law allowed it. Sounds like you have the problem with Jesus words, take it up with him.

You know, the whole it is better to obey God rather than man, when Gods laws conflict with Mans.

Matt 5v38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
[39] But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.

Also interesting to note in the first few centuries after Christ, non violence was what Christian's followed..
T]he conviction that Christianity was incompatible with the shedding of blood, either in war or in the administration of justice, was not only maintained and vigorously defended by eminent individuals like Tertullian of Carthage, Hippolytus of Rome and Origen of Palestine and Egypt, but was widely held and acted on in the Churches up and down Christendom

Christianity,ff77oml,t1_ff5yo85,1579642742.0,"Well by that reasoning the USA should never invade any country ever, as God has set them in power so to fight them would be fighting against Gods will.

Also, it is better to obey God rather than man, so if Jesus tells you to turn the other cheek and the law says to defend yourself.. what do you do?

If Christian's in America believe it is ok to shoot and kill someone for literally just walking through a field they own, because the law might say it's ok..  is that really what you think Jesus would do?"

With Russia The origins of the famine lay in the decision by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to collectivize agriculture in 1929. Teams of Communist Party agitators forced peasants to relinquish their land, personal property, and sometimes housing to collective farms, and they deported so-called kulaks—wealthier peasants—as well as any peasants who resisted collectivization altogether. Collectivization led to a drop in production, the disorganization of the rural economy, and food shortages. It also sparked a series of peasant rebellions, including armed uprisings, in some parts of Ukraine.
