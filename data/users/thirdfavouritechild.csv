unpopularopinion,ffv64bx,t1_ffv5f81,1580256579.0,"That is a good point. I found I was wearing my hat all the time to keep it out of my face whenever I had to do something. I had it in that awkward spot of too short for a hair tie, but too long to just leave"
unpopularopinion,ffv0e0n,t1_ffuzgvk,1580252831.0,"Lmfao, that is hilarious! I lived with two women in a large house during college, and SOMEHOW their hair always ended up in my bed. One time, wrapped around my, err, well yeah. Like, how!!?"
unpopularopinion,ffuzboj,t1_ffucwah,1580252232.0,"I've grown my hair out twice as a dude and loved it, but long hair is such a pain in the ass lol. I don't know how women do it."

AskMen,ffrxoqa,t3_eusmpq,1580168250.0,"Touch. Touch is huge for a lot of people, and especially men don't get physical affection through touch enough. If you're ever worried he thinks you're distant that is what I'd recommend. A simple hug, arm squeeze, kiss, anything. Slap his ass if you like, but I promise touch will go a long way."
AskMen,ffp90mi,t3_eubu50,1580089194.0,"I would definitely ask to see some ID, but aside from that as long as you don't also act like a 16 year old, wouldn't be an issue. Enjoy your life long student discount :)"
Futurology,ffgyz08,t1_ffg5laa,1579918682.0,Yup. A perfect system will never account for human selfishness and greed. People also hate being told what to do. Personally I don't think systems like this will be possible until the majority of driving is automated.

Tinder,ff0o5kk,t3_equah7,1579470688.0,"What a fucking outfit to get married in, damn! Do you think a Canadian can pull this off as the best man? Asking for a friend..."
Tinder,fev076s,t3_eqfkbf,1579391690.0,You gotta hand it to people like this. Sometimes people wait months to show you they're like this. Here's this prick showing you out of the gate so you don't have to wait three weeks to dump them. Very thoughtful.
AskMen,fen89a2,t3_epyrad,1579279134.0,"The times I have been blown away by a woman have always come from people who are just themselves. No bullshit, no games. No hiding parts of yourself for the first few months. Just themselves, out of the gate. There is something about watching someone be genuine. Obviously not all women are faking parts of themselves either due to insecurities or just to fit into a group, and men definitely do this as well! But I've found it is enough that when you meet someone genuine, you notice. 

You're still going to not click with someone if you aren't compatible, but in my honest opinion the more you just own who you are, the easier it's going to be to become, ""the girl"".

Just remember men aren't all that complicated, most of us just haven't been shown how or allowed to express ourselves. So the more we don't have to worry about what you're thinking, or going to think, the more we will want to connect. 

And plan a date every once in a while, that shit is tiring."
AskMen,fef6c58,t3_eolsp9,1579049223.0,They're like bees. More afraid of you than you are of them. Confidence goes a long way.

AskReddit,fe2mdl1,t3_eng8y5,1578840510.0,"Dont rush. Take your time, ask questions, embrace the fact that you both will be nervous and awkward. Nothing wrong with that! 

And foreplay lasts until it looks like they are being possessed by an angry demon, then you have sex."

worldnews,fden22v,t3_ekwlgd,1578342478.0,"That is such a difficult and amazing response to what happened. It is so easy to just push the populace into an anti-american pathway, and to identify the actual issue is very impressive. 

Hopefully it encourages the average American people they are defending themselves put pressure on their own leaders."
