There is if you're purchasing a security insurance. I would pay extra to have the murderer caught if my family was murdered. It would be part of my security contact with my company

Additionally it would be in a security companies best interest to catch a serial killer since they are getting revenue from people purchasing their services

Finally you could also pay a detective a la Carte. Anecdote time. A friend of mine was murdered about 10 years ago. Cops searched for a few months, said they found no one. His father put up a $20k bounty for the killer and in 24 hours multiple witnesses came forward.

videos,ffdtz04,t1_ffdsq0m,1579828868.0,"First off, roads are mostly developed by private companies anyway. 

If you're talking about owning roads that's because it's Literally. Fucking. Illegal. Because the government has a monopoly

To counter your example of a monopoly being private roads, consider this. 

The longer the distance one is traveling, the more possible routes there are to get to the destination. Even if Jones has no choice but to use road X to get to the local grocery store, because people traveling long distances do have a choice in whether they take road X as part of their longer trip or not, the owner of road X will face pressure to make road X more appealing in quality and price to long-distance travelers, benefiting local drivers as well.

Even if Jones is forced to use road X when he drives to certain locations, he has flexibility in the upper bound of how often and to what extent he uses road X. If road X is high-quality and reasonably priced, Jones won’t just use it when he absolutely has to, but rather he will choose to go out more often and stay home less. When he does go out, he will be more willing to go to locations that require staying on road X for a greater distance, such as going to a far away movie theater rather than the nearby bowling alley, which is relevant if a road or highway charges by distance traveled. Thus, even when road X has no other roads to compete with, which it does indeed in the case of long-distance travelers, it competes against Jones’ phone, TV, computer, video game console, board games, books, etc.

Any road providers who make part or all of their income via billboards and other advertisements, vendor stands, stores, or pit stops on property on or adjacent to their roads have an incentive to maintain a smooth and constant flow of traffic to constantly draw new eyes and wallets, which would increase the amount they could charge for advertisement and vendor space.

The question of an abusive proprietor of a road in a residential area would seldom even be raised, as networks of residential roads would be owned by the homeowner associations, covenant communities, or simply residents of the neighborhoods in which they are located, and have predetermined contracts guaranteeing road use to those buying homes in those neighborhoods. No one buys a house without also buying legal ownership of something as essential as the roof or driveway of the house. Likewise, in the future of more widespread privatized roads, road access rights will almost certainly be bundled into home purchases as much as the roofs or driveways of homes are now. As an example, a network of neighborhood streets with two hundred homes might be 1/200th owned by each homeowner, including a contract guaranteeing permanent road access to each homeowner.

Finally, with the matter of the roads immediately connected to people’s homes and in their neighborhoods solved, this provides breathing space (the longer the distance traveled, the more possible routes) such that this larger unit, the neighborhood, would likely possess multiple competing options for roads connecting it to the rest of the world from the north, south, east, and west.

Roads are easy, I'm glad you chose that one. There's literally a meme of ""without the government who would build and own the roads?!?"" Because it's such a juvenile critique

Natural monopolies do not exist. Government monopolies do exist. Please give an example of a natural monopoly ($10 says you say something ill informed like robber barons)

In your example, in order to have a monopoly on roads you would have to own all the land. In order to do that, you would be the government

You do not understand how the internet works. That's like saying with telephones you would have to all use the same telephone company

Yes, last mile communities would have to work together to agree to get internet to their area because it would have to go through people's private property. I have a friend who does this and lays new line for small ISPs. It already exists, just difficult with all the laws

No, there would for sure be low cost options which you already see in Detroit. Google ""private security Detroit"". Their highest customers are poor areas. Wealthy areas are currently covered by the police state which favors the wealthy

Your referring to fire services in the Roman times which were protected by the government

Prisons are not private. They receive 100% of their funding from taxation not voluntary customers. You can call them private but they're not. It's like saying Boeing if they only got government contracts was private

You did not address the real world example of Detroit ghettos resorting to private security because of government ineptitude and government doing everything they can to stop them. Read up on it. Interesting stuff

If I found out my security company was harassing people I wouldn't use that security company. That's just paying people to harass people. You can do that already. If it became a big enough problem you could... Hire a security company

I don't think people would waste money paying a company to harass people though. Waste of money

Don't murder, harm or steal or vandalize are pretty much the only universal laws everyone agrees with. It would be no problem prosecuting this guy for multiple murders even if only one person paid the security company

Most people would likely pay for a security company just like pretty much everyone with a house pays for home owners insurance but it would be completely your call based on costs and benefits

Many companies are not corrupt. The corruption stems from them being able to pay off the government to change laws and use violence to unfairly compete (aka lobbying and regulation). Why do you think Walmart lobby's to raise the minimum wage for example?

Yes government is a monopoly on violence. That's why it's always corrupt since the beginning of time. You give a oligarchy the most powerful thing to do to other people without the same recourse

Anarchy would not become communism naturally because it does not scale. It would only work if people trusted each other so it only works on small groups like families or tribes. In larger groups you would have something more akin to capitalism due to anonymity. Capitalism is the natural state of people. Voluntarily trading goods and services

Now as far as your isp example. First off, this requires vastly more infrastructure than police and is vastly more expensive *but* even so it is mainly government regulations (zoning, etc) preventing new ISPs from moving in. If you want a real world example of this look at Google fiber and the difficulty they've had from regulations

If a business refuses to cover an area, then they refuse to cover an area and that's an opportunity for another business to move in and capitalize on lack of competition. This would be predominantly in rural settings

As far as funding you're assuming it has to be ""a-la-carte"" as in, something happens, then you pay for a cop to respond. It could be that, or it could be any of other models. Maybe an insurance type model. Maybe you want to move to a subscription model where security officers patrol around guarding people's private property.

Lol. Tons of people get wealthy off of government monopolies and regulations. 

> What happens when someone simply refuses to pay for law enforcement? Do they simply not get protection?

Yes. Talk to people in the ghetto and see whether or not they would want just the option of no cops. In Detroit it's gotten so bad private firms are popping up *despite* there being a heavily funded police department. These actually topically pop up in poorer neighborhoods as well, not rich ones

The current system completely marginalizes the poor

> Do they intentionally get harassed?

No a security company coming onto someone else's property uninvited would be the same as if a thug did it. Trespassing

> What if a spree killer takes out 3 houses worth of people on a block but only 1 of those houses uses a security company, does the killer essentially get the other 2 killings free? 

Not sure what you mean by free. Obviously the company would have an incentive to protect the paying subscriber and get the criminal or else people would not continue their subscriptions with the company

I think you're getting confused about law, not law enforcement

> which means you're completely fucked in the likely event all companies are corrupt.

Someone could start a non corrupt company and compete. The start up costs for this would be vastly lower than many current businesses that are private

> In a democracy, an actual one, any police force would be directly held responsible by the populace and any unauthorized or corrupt act would be answered by the populace changing the police force through political will

But they're not and it doesn't happen. The police have a monopoly so the police investigate the police and protect themselves. This is why people always joke that when a cop or presinct is shown to be corrupt all that happens is they get paid vacation. 

Can you vote to have a cop removed? No

This would be the equivalent of giving Walmart a monopoly on retail and if you're not satisfied the only recourse you have is for everyone to vote on a new CEO every 4 years. Vs you know, going to Target or Amazon

todayilearned,ffc7c47,t1_ffc3oiv,1579793214.0,"I'm opposed to any government owned business for multiple reasons. 

The main reason has to do with the [economic calculation problem](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem). That's a great article but I'll give a brief run down of it

Basically in order to run a business, there's basically 2 variables: revenue and expenditure. If your revenue is greater than your expenditures then you make a profit, if it is less than your expenditures you go out of business. Simple

So when you're running a business, you have to make sure these variables stay in line. Let's say one thing you're selling isn't popular, you as the business owner get a market signal about this so you can adjust your business model so that you're not wasting resources on it. Opposite is true to, if there's something that people want that you can't get enough of, you adjust your business model. This works because everyone is making voluntary transactions with their own property or labor so you get the signals of what people want

In centralized planning, you lose 1 or both of these signals. In pure socialism, you lose both the cost of the business to run because every aspect you need to obtain is also centrally planned so it's not what people voluntarily pay, it's what a central authority deems something to cost and you lose the market signal of expenditures. Same thing for revenue, if everyone is just getting it ""for free"" then you don't really know what people want or are willing to pay for so you lose that market signal

This results in extremely inefficient use of scarce resources, even if the people in charge are completely altruistic and only have the best intentions, it will still fail or at best be extremely inefficient. It's the reason why socialism will always fail

Centrally run businesses have the same problem except they do get a better idea of costs because not everything in the economy is centrally planned so it is sightly more efficient than pure socialism so at least the planners have 1/2 important variables

There are tons of YouTube videos and articles explaining this better but it's basically the reason why all government businesses are always ""underfunded""

The second reason is incentives. 

People say profit is a bad incentive but think about what profit really is in the context of a business. Revenue greater than expenditures. In order to increase profit you just either increase revenue or decrease expenditures. 

Decreasing expenditures can be done but only up to a point where you're not losing revenue because of it. In the insurance model for example, you can cut expenditures by denying claims, this works up until the point you start losing customers (revenue) because they see what you're doing and go to an alternative

Government run businesses are still businesses and still must try and have expenditures be less than revenue. That's just basic economics. If they don't then people won't work for the business and it won't work. (I'm assuming no slaves). The difference is incentives. The government insurance doesn't have to try and convince people to give them money, they have to convince the central authority to give them money (revenue) you as the consumer have little to no recourse as you can't go to a competitor. Therefore the government becomes the consumer not the individual

Additionally with expenses, government run businesses can cut expenditures to a much much larger degree because again, the individuals have little recourse. They can't go to a different competitor if they think what they are receiving isn't worth what they are paying

Long winded, but those 2 economic reasons are why I'm always against centrally controlled authoritarian businesses like universal health care (which could also be called government monopoly healthcare)

These also explain many of the problems you mentioned in your NHS"
todayilearned,ffc23ze,t1_ffbskxd,1579789613.0,"Healthcare spending in America is basically the worst of both worlds of capitalism and socialism. It's essentially privatized gains and socialized losses for hospitals and insurance companies. Known as ""crony capitalism"" and is a cross between public and private

Profit driven companies are not inherently bad. Food production is profit driven and you need food to survive and it's pretty cheap. Pretty much every other kind of insurance is profit driven with much higher satisfaction rates, cheaper prices, vastly more competition, etc. Healthcare is so heavily regulated compared to those though that there is almost no competition which leads to higher prices etc

The history of American healthcare is actually kind of interesting. One of the biggest problems is that it's tied to employment. This is weird because no other insurance is. The reason it is is because back in WW2 the US government fixed wages for a short time so employers got around this by giving ""benefits"" to employees such as paying for health insurance

[Here's a good article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/upshot/the-real-reason-the-us-has-employer-sponsored-health-insurance.html)

Another big event was when Medicare took over price fixing in the US which I can go into but is it in depth

Another problem is each state has tons of different laws which essentially prevent healthcare companies from competing over state lines leading to monopolies

Finally what also happens in the United States is Medicare (your nhs but just for old, young, poor and pregnant) pays vastly less than private insurance to doctors and hospitals. We call the percentage of patients who pay with public vs private insurance ""payer mix"". If everyone switched to Medicare overnight, pretty much all but the biggest hospitals and big practices of physicians would go under. My personal practice would probably have to fire at least 1/3-1/2 of our nurses if this happened. Private insurance is essentially subsidizing Medicare and Medicaid which makes the entire system even more convoluted

As a physician, I think us healthcare model is fucked. I also think the NHS model is fucked and I would not want to switch to it. Just because I'm against universal government controlled healthcare does not mean I'm in any way satisfied with the current system as both a physician and customer"

Also pretending the United States is anything like a free market for healthcare is comical. We give free universal healthcare to children, old people, pregnant women, and poor people. Close to half of all medical expenditure is government already. Just so you know

Our system is also hilariously regulated. In my state for example, the insurance company has a monopoly. You either get the private insurance or you're on the government insurance (or you have no insurance, you still get treated and just get sent a bill which most people won't pay so there hospital writes it off and the doctors work for free, EMTALA).

Monero is what people think Bitcoin is. Private.

If you don't believe me, just look up the ""rich lists"" of ethereum, Bitcoin and Monero for a chuckle

If you want another *legal* thought experiment about why privacy is important let's think about businesses

Let's assume some kind of crypto becomes super popular in the next upcoming years. If you were a business accepting Bitcoin for example, your addresses would be known. The amounts sent to those addresses would also be known. Therefore every competitor could fairly easily analyze the blockchain and see easily what kind of transactions you are receiving and estimate what kind of volume you are moving for your products. Right now only the centralized sources like PayPal can see this and they have to keep it private by law... But blockchains are not private. This would be a huge disadvantage to any business and a huge advantage to any upstart trying to copy the model so why would the original business who pioneered this model opt to choose it?

Another reason is fungibility

Crypto is used for many illegal activities. If you could trace specific coins to illicit activities, those coins could potentially be blacklisted from trade, especially under government pressure. This is what we call fungibility, it e ""every coin is equal to every other coin"". The only way this is possible is if every transaction is private"

In the United States, government companies rarely (if ever, I can't think of one but there probably is one) turn a profit and instead are ""always underfunded""

It's actually surprisingly hard to find a comprehensive study on that for some reason. I was surprised. This one was the only one I could find that compared the entire country and took medians between private and public

I was saying wealth is created when other people value your labor or goods and voluntarily exchange money for them. Not about how hard you work or how smart you are 

If I'm interpreting, what you're saying is that you think people should get paid more than their market value, which is another way of saying they should get paid more than what other people would voluntarily pay them because ""you value them"" (even though you don't in the sense I'm talking about because you're not giving these people any more money)

If you really think about what rich people are doing, they are providing a service that people want more than people want whatever amount of green pieces of paper in their hands

Steve jobs made billions because a whole lot of people would rather have an iPhone than $500. He made the world a better place because he created something people wanted more than green pieces of paper so everyone was wealthier for it

And no, I'm calling you economically illiterate because you're writing a rambling novel of anecdotes without saying anything specific. 

Like which regulations you want and why. You have no clue and it's funny. You just see someone with more money than you and get jealous and want others to take it from them for you. You don't even fundamentally seem to understand why that person has more money to begin with

All that matters, is if people will voluntarily give you money for your labor or goods. By doing so, you're making the world a wealthier place because people are choosing what you're selling over little pieces of paper

It's very simple, if you produce more of what people want than you consume, then you accumulate money. If you consume more than you produce than you lose money. Wealth for a group of people is created when they produce more labor or goods that other people want than they consume"
