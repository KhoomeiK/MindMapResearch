 Just be patient with yourself. And run a little slower now and again so that you can go longer. You'll get there!

news,fd6owy2,t1_evucfww,1578193956.0,"The Mauna is a culturally sacred place. 


This isn't only about scientists wanting to do science, it's about the continuous disrespect and disregard for indigenous people and land. This is the same thing as the DAPL situation - indigenous people advocating for their own rights to protect land that is truly theirs, to protect their ecosystem, to protect what is sacred to their culture and tradition. And their peaceful protests have been met with heavily armed police forces.


People forget that Hawaii isn't just a state. Hawaii was a flourishing nation before US imperialism. Hawaiian is an ethnicity. It is deeply cultural, traditional, and sacred. It's not just a resort for you to treat like trash. It's not land that's available for a free-for-all for people to do whatever they want."
