insanepeoplefacebook,ffqgvn3,t1_ffqbtks,1580134229.0,"I've got a challenge for you.

Spend one day thinking to yourself there is no god. When you die that's just it. It's exactly the same as before you were born.

Spend a day thinking on that, push out of your mind the idea of a god. Once you do everything makes a lot more sense. Like all the big difficult questions have been answered.

What's the meaning of life? There is no ascribed meaning, therefore it only has the meaning we personally choose to give it.

Who created the universe? No one, it was a natural event.

What happens when we die? Nothing, it's the same as before you were born. You are no longer in existence.

God is a safety blanket we use to comfort ourselves. One you are better off without."
OutOfTheLoop,ffqfupq,t1_ffqe0j8,1580133362.0,"Yup, great write up.

I think the Captain Marvel movie failures has a few parallels with Ghostbusters.

* The first is that they are dealing with a wider franchise which has an established fan base that comes with expectations. When they aren't met the studio refuses to acknowledge it meaning people shout louder to be heard.

* The second (and I think most important) is that they were just bad movies. Like objectively shit. I gave up on both of them about half way though at first attempt as they were just shit. Bland, poorly written and very low bar. They are like the hollywood version of day time tv. It's just mush.

* Thirdly, they alienated the core and most vocal part of their audience with an 'anti men' tone or undercurrent in the movie. Instead of showing women being brilliant by just being fucking brilliant they took the cheap route by showing women as better by belittling men. People then over react to what is just lazy writing and you end up with the sort of shitstorm online both moves created."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffqeqkp,t1_ffqdwdu,1580132395.0,From my understanding under American law if you are married it doesn't actually matter if you are the biological father or not. You're still seen as legally responsible for the child. So you can't just walk away clean even if they did cheat on you.
OutOfTheLoop,ffq6nwe,t3_eul731,1580123367.0,"Answer : The trial takes 2 weeks and it's going to come in and out of the news cycle in that time. Here's a rough schedule I found:

* Tuesday: Voting on rules and motions can be made by Wednesday morning (which might include a motion to dismiss)
* Wednesday, January 22: Prosecution arguments
* Thursday, January 23: Prosecution arguments
* Friday, January 24: Prosecution arguments
* Saturday, January 25: Defense arguments (10 a.m. to 12 p.m.)
* Sunday, January 26: Day off
* Monday, January 27 – Defense arguments
* Tuesday, January 28 – Defense arguments (not clear if happening) or Q&A to legal defense teams
* Wednesday, January 29 – Q&A to legal defense teams
* After this, it’s unclear. There might be witnesses or there might not. If witnesses are allowed, they would be deposed first and then it would be determined if they could testify.

As to why it's not more prominent, I would venture that the day to day of it just isn't that interesting. There are only so many ways to reiterate the same information.

Looking at the highlights from the last week that appears to be the case:

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html

This week we will likely get more coverage as the defence puts across their points. By Wednesday it will be all over the news would be my guess."

Now let's move on to the rest of the garbled nonsense that you call a response.

> You are dumb as fuck if you think this climate change can't be stopped by man

Did you mean **can** be stopped by man? I'm assuming you did. But yeah, of course it can. It's man made. How do we know? Because there is just fuck tons of evidence that show it is:

https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/

> The planet is evolving and goes through cycles right now we are heating but we will go back into another ice age

You do get that both can be happening. Ie, yes there are cycles but we are causing an effect within those? It's not a case of 'but they're cycles... checkmate!'.

Want to read about the effect that climate change will have within that cycle? Great! Here's an article from MIT for you:

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/416786/global-warming-vs-the-next-ice-age/

> Man has not been studying the Earth long enough to have a very good idea of what is about to come

Geologically speaking man has not been on the earth very long. Yet we still somehow manage to study things like rock formation and topography which involve processes which take place of millennia. Hmmm, it's almost like we can study things which have taken place a long time ago?

We have a really good idea of what is to come. It's what people are trying to prevent. If you had kids then you might be somewhat alarmed to think they are going to grow old in a world severely impacted by climate change. You are one of the people robbing those kids of their future. History is not going to look upon you kindly.

> They cannot even explain why there is a change in the earth's gravitational field.

And? Anyway here's an article on it, fill your boots:

https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-shows-that-earth-s-magnetic-field-is-weakening-more-rapidly-than-we-thought

Basically it might flip, it might not, it's going to take 1000's of years either way. But saying we shouldn't give a shit about climate change because... earths magentic field? Well that's some next level mental gymnastics."
