DeadBedrooms,fdizsio,t3_el65q4,1578454844.0,"Mine is downstairs smoking weed and drinking. I’m sorry. I feel lonely a lot, too. I’ve started just consuming myself with things around the house. I need a hobby. I miss butterflies and excitement. I miss someone being so excited to come home to me. Covering me with kisses the second they’re through the door. Genuine happiness to be in my presence. Feeling desired. I think I’ve cried everyday for about two months at this point. I’d give anything to be laid with and cuddled. Comforted. 

I’m thinking about you. You aren’t alone."

When I’ve been at the end of my rope, I just have to think about him and how much he’d miss me and how no one could love or take care of him like me. He saves me."
