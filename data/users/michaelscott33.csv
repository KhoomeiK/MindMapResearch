AskReddit,fbqf3h6,t3_ee2ps8,1577031098.0,"I have three. I know my age from only one of them though, the rest I can't really remember but I know I couldn't speak yet. I was three and was watching Courage the cowardly dog and for some strange reason I thought to myself, ""I am watching this for the first time, this is really good I like it but I have not seen this before"" I still remember that... (around 1999). Another one when I couldn't eat on my own yet and my mother gave me a little sour cream to taste, the sensation was horrible. I still hate sour cream to this day. And a very superfluous memory where I wake up (had just learned to walk I think 2-3 years of age), walk around my apartment and find that nobody is home so I go like........ what. the. fucl (i mean not literally but I had a deeply strange sensation of isolation) so I start bawling right there and then. I have a few other ones but I feel like they're from that period on."
