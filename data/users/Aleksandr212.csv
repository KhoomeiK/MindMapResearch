depression,fek5j3x,t1_fek4rew,1579193050.0,I have a little feeling left that maybe if I would move away and start a new life maybe things would change but the extreme lack of sleep and the feeling of hopelessness depression predominates that feeling for a long time now.
depression,fek47dj,t1_fek33zv,1579192250.0,"I don't know what my life means but as I said theres not much left on which I can hold on to even my emotions suddenly all died due to my depression, lack of social skills, never having a person that really loves or likes me like a girlfriend for example which I never had in my entire life and being disappointed by everyone I've ever considered,, close to me "" yet seeing them finding relationships or new friends or jobs while my own life breaks apart more and more kills my thoughts on giving life one last chance."
depression,fek30aa,t3_eph7wh,1579191528.0,I confess I had opportunities in my life but I somehow fucked up every single one of them.
