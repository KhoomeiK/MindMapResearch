history,fdia6v9,t1_fdhl9nu,1578438518.0,"Hello again,

Your citation was from Saudi Arabia. They are notorious for being overtly literalist and a touch (to put it lightly) extreme. I'm curious about how the implementation and interpretation of Islamic Law changed over the centuries, and how much of Saudi's interpretation was held by past scholars. 

If you (or anyone else reading these comments) are curious I've been pointed towards Intisar A.  Rabb. She's a professor of law at Harvard and the director of its Islamic legal studies program. Her books ""Justice and Leadership in Early Islamic Courts"" and ""Doubts in Islamic Law: A History of Legal Maxims, Interpretation, and Islamic Criminal Law"" are apparently good resources for learning more about the subject. 

Have a good day!"
history,fdhsy1y,t1_fdhl9nu,1578429577.0,"Thank you for the citations. I was asking for a point of entry for research.

EDIT: Also in regards to the verse 9:29 of the Qur'an, I believe it is saying humbled in regard to the state, not humbled towards individual Muslims. As in, after war land is conquered, the caliphate becomes the ruling state and the conquered people are subjugated as citizens of that state. They no longer fight against it, they have conceded defeat and have joined it. As it usually goes with expanding states.

Of course as with anything in the Qur'an it is up for interpretation and I can see how some may reach the same conclusion you did and use it for justification."

history,fdhit2a,t1_fdhc5cn,1578423543.0,"Non Muslims are ""lower status than Muslims, whom they must treat with deference at all times"" 

And

Non Muslims ""cannot bear witness against Muslims in court""

Can you please provide citations for these? I'm curious of  which caliphate placed these rules, as they're not an Islamic law (as in from Qur'an or hadith) I think. 

Also, I do know that in the Qur'an there is a verse stating all are equal except in their faith. But the commonly accepted interpretation of that is only God can judge one's faith, so from a human perspective we're all equal.  Nonetheless I can see how that verse could be used to explain class difference between Muslims and non Muslims though, if one chooses to interpret faith as the religion they belong to and uses that as justification for different treatment.

EDIT:
Also it might be interesting to note that Islamic belief is everyone is born Muslim regardless of the religion of their parents. It is also believed that young children do not sin, as they are still learning to understand right from wrong. That's why all who die as young children automatically go to paradise. 

How this translated to social affairs in caliphates, I do not know. I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't really taken into consideration."

I made 16 pasties with this recipe. 

Mushroom Filling:

2 tblspn olive oil

1 tspn cumin seeds

1 medium yellow onion, diced

Salt, to taste

1/2 tspn pepper

1/2 tspn red chilli flakes 

1/4 tspn red chilli powder

2 tblspn unsalted butter

500g cremini mushrooms, chopped

4 triangles of Laughing Cow Cheese

100g cheddar cheese, grated

1/4 cup milk


Sautee the cumin seeds in the olive oil until fragrant. 

Add the diced onions and cook until golden brown. 

Add the salt, pepper, chilli flakes and powder. 

Once combined melt in the butter. 

Add the mushrooms 

Once the mushrooms are cooked add the cheese and milk

Combine well and set aside to cool




Puff Pastry:

Buy from your local grocery store unless you are a masochist. In which case, you may have my greatest admiration and esteem. 


Fill pastry with the mushroom filling. 

Lather with egg wash. 

Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes."

funny,fd0hfhm,t1_fd0f8ax,1578118838.0,"One of the biggest parts of Islam is to follow the example (Sunnah) of the prophet Muhammad pbuh. There are a collection of stories (hadeeth) narrated by the companions of the prophet that showcase these examples. One such hadeeth is as follows:

Narrated Abu Qatadah: ‚ÄúThe Messenger of Allah came towards us while carrying Umamah the daughter of Abi Al-`As (Prophet‚Äôs granddaughter) over his shoulder. He prayed, and when he wanted to bow, he put her down, and when he stood up he lifted her up.‚Äù (Al-Bukhari)

This hadeeth is one example of many, of the prophet showing great care towards children, even during prayer. Children as expected to be children. If their playing interferes with one's prayer, then that person must simply adapt and continue praying while also accommodating for the child. Islam teaches patience and gentleness towards children.

This is not to say that Muslims have not punished children for interfering with prayers. This is to say that punishment is wrong and goes against Islam."

Baking,fcabncl,t3_eglt4j,1577566256.0,"The recipe. Yeilds 105 toonie sized shells:

130g almond flour

130g Icing sugar, sifted

100g egg whites, room temperature

5g meringue powder

1-2g cream of tartar (4 shakes?) 

90g granulated sugar


Ensure all tools are dry and completely oil free. 

Flour must be finely ground and without clumps.

Costco brand is best. Others require fixing up first. 


Whisk flour and icing sugar until completely blended 

Let egg whites sit with the cream if tartar and meringue powder for at least an hour at room temperature. 

Whip egg whites, meringue powder and cream of tartar until foamy

Whip in glass or metal bowl. Dry and oil free! 

Gradually add in the sugar to the meringue

Whip until hard peaks form


Fold half the flour mixture in with the meringue

Press lightly to reveal more meringue if necessary 

Only until all the flour is touching the meringue

Fold other half until all flour is touching

Once successfully folded add food colouring. 

Gel with tooth pick. Fold until kinda blended. 

Will blend more during macronage. 


Now macronage

Fold

Press hard 3 times, spatula should hit bottom of bowl

Fold

Push the batter under itself by sliding the spatula from the opposite side of the bowl towards the middle under the batter. 

Fold and Repeat.

Check if batter is sliding off.

Eventually lessen to 2 presses.

Check.

Eventually lessen to 1 press.

Check with ribbon figure 8 test.



Once test is successful put in piping bag.

Do not let mixture sit at this state for long.

Place clean, oil free silpat on upside down baking pan

Pipe circles keeping in mind they will spread a little

Once a sheet is filled hit the inside of the pan to spread

Using a toothpick pop any big air bubbles

Let them sit until a skin forms, about 20-30 min

Letting them sit longer is better than putting them in the oven too early.

Check by running finger over to make sure it's hard.


Once they're near ready to go in, preheat oven to 315 degrees.

Rack in upper middle half of the oven. 

3rd rung from the top for me. 

Once oven is heated pop tray in and lower heat to 280 degrees.

Bake for 20-30 minutes.

Once feet form (maybe around 15 min), let them sit for another 5 minutes then turn the tray around
Let them bake for another 10 minutes.

Before adding next tray to oven preheat to 315 again and repeat.


Let macarons completely cool before touching

Once they're good remove from pans.

Match similar sized shells and make sandwiches.

Pipe filling into them

Let sit in air tight container for 2 days for best texture.
Might have to refrigerate depending on filling. Let them come to room temperature before eating. 


NOTE FOR MACRONAGE:
Number of presses depends on the size of your spatula. If you're using a big spatula, about the size of an adult woman's hand, do only 2 presses then lower.
If you're unsure just do 1 press. It'll take longer but you won't over deflate the mixture by accident."
