AmItheAsshole,ffagtwe,t1_ff9xb4f,1579735419.0,"Makes sense, but it's only bad for certain people. Getting rewarded with a little money after buying a ticket can set some people up for a long-term gambling addiction. But if you can realistically look at how unlikely you are to win and how it's not really worth the money you're spending, you're probably not gonna be the person who makes buying one a habit. Most people get one cuz they have extra money that they don't know what to spend on and they've already saved most of it."
AmItheAsshole,ffag9o4,t3_esfxc0,1579735049.0,"NTA. $10 an hour is not that much. It's what young teenagers would make for doing the same stuff for their neighbors or whatever. If you feel like you deserve to be paid more, then by all means go find someone else that will pay you what you're worth."
AmItheAsshole,ffaf5s1,t1_ff9ukny,1579734280.0,"Do you yourself have younger siblings? I do, and while it definitely doesn't serve a person to be rude to their siblings for no reason, those kids will quickly pick up on what you're willing to do for them, and if you don't show them that you aren't gonna give them whatever they want, they're gonna try to walk all over you. I love my sisters and they know that, but they also know that I wouldn't put up with that kind of bullshit. My job is to help nurture them and support them, not spoil them."
AmItheAsshole,ffaeni0,t1_ff9ynnw,1579733886.0,You say that like 13 year olds are too stupid to know how to look for stuff. There's only so many places you can hide your food in one house.
AmItheAsshole,ffaefky,t3_esaf1h,1579733709.0,"NTA. Occasionally stealing some of your siblings' food is one thing, but constantly taking all of the food they bought for themselves is not acceptable. Also, can you imagine someone using their excuses for taking other things? ""Oh, you don't need all that money"" and using that as an excuse to steal it from someone? It's not the same seriousness but my point is that theft is not ok no matter what the reason or situation. There's nothing wrong with taking precautions to keep your property safe. What you did is the same thing as putting signs up at your house saying you have a guard dog or a security system. It's a deterrent, not a threat. Nothing vicious about it."
AmItheAsshole,ffade7q,t1_ff9h5w6,1579732915.0,"Yeah when you have siblings, it's normal to occasionally steal some of each other's snacks, but constantly stealing all of the food they bought for themselves wouldn't fly in my home. I'd fuck them up."
AmItheAsshole,ffad4em,t1_ff926up,1579732726.0,">OP spent time and money to get something she wanted and the sister feels entitled to it. 

Yes, exactly this. Completely NTA for making sure nobody takes what she deserves to keep for herself."
AmItheAsshole,ffac445,t1_ff9j5gz,1579732037.0,"Ok now THAT is stupid. Me and my younger siblings all get rewarded for grades(well, it's a little different for me now that I've graduated). The amount of money would go up for the level of schooling. For example, in middle School and early high school I was given $10 for an A, and in late high school I was given $20 for an A (other amounts for B's and C's), and I'm sure once my younger sisters get to that level they'll be given the same treatment. It doesn't matter which of us got better grades usually, we were all expected to try our best and were all rewarded when we did well."
AmItheAsshole,ffaa66c,t3_esaf1h,1579730891.0,NTA. I would do the same thing. No way are my sisters touching the food I bought for myself with them asking first. It's not even real peanuts.

AmItheAsshole,fed4nwb,t1_fed3t7y,1578998666.0,"Yeah, I also said NAH. It's likely that OP didn't know exactly what she was asking of SIL when she made the suggestion."
AmItheAsshole,fed4db3,t1_fed4at6,1578998239.0,"No, I live in America. They usually just ask if I think I could be pregnant, and I say no since I wasn't sexually active."
AmItheAsshole,fed4b0l,t1_fecz49x,1578998145.0,"Her epilepsy from the incident will cause serious complications during pregnancy that could end up killing her and the baby. It isn't fair of OP to ask her to carry her husband's baby and risk her life while mourning and no one to support her, just to give it away to someone else. Is SIL the asshole for not wanting to risk death while still grieving her husband and most likely suffering from PTSD?"
AmItheAsshole,fed42n9,t1_fecyng8,1578997800.0,"The thing is, and you may not have known this, carrying the child with epilepsy could very likely end up with SIL and the baby being dead. OP only thought about herself and the unborn baby, she didn't think about how she was asking her SIL to risk her life just to give her dead husband's baby to someone else. SIL isn't mentally of physically fit to continue with the pregnancy."
AmItheAsshole,fed3osx,t1_fecyxrq,1578997238.0,"Excuse me? SIL could literally die if she continues the pregnancy due to her epilepsy, and you think it's ok to demand that she put her own health and grief aside for someone else? No way in hell."
AmItheAsshole,fed3itv,t1_fecyok7,1578996998.0,"OP didn't think at all about how SIL would be affected by this. She literally asked her to carry a baby while grieving her husband and POSSIBLY DIE because of her new health conditions and how being pregnant will trigger them, and then give her baby away to someone who already has kids. OP may miss her brother, but she doesn't have a right to his and SIL's baby."
AmItheAsshole,fed325e,t1_fecww1b,1578996309.0,The thing is it's probably not even safe for her to carry the baby. Her condition will definitely cause some SERIOUS medical complications during pregnancy.
AmItheAsshole,fed2xqj,t1_fecrwj3,1578996127.0,"OP probably had good intentions, but you can tell that they haven't thought at all about how it would affect SIL. She isn't in any physical or mental shape to carry a baby."
AmItheAsshole,fed2qsv,t1_fecvco6,1578995841.0,"OP's family have each other. SIL doesn't. Can you really blame her for wanting to talk to someone when she's been grieving her husband all alone? SIL needed someone to confide in, not someone to tell her what to do with her own child."
AmItheAsshole,fed2i0l,t1_fecx6qj,1578995473.0,"SO true. It's just not fair to ask the poor woman to go through that pregnancy with no one to support her, just to hand it over to someone else."
AmItheAsshole,fed249f,t1_fecqggw,1578994899.0,"It's better because if SIL tries to carry the baby in her physical state, both she and the baby could likely die."
AmItheAsshole,fed1xiu,t1_fecdqlp,1578994614.0,"The thing is, not only would it be traumatizing for SIL to carry her dead husband's baby while grieving him, but it would also be INCREDIBLY dangerous with her new medical conditions. She and the baby could both die if she decides to go through with the pregnancy. OP probably has good intentions, but she hasn't thought at all about how SIL would suffer if she does what OP suggested."
AmItheAsshole,fed1ra2,t1_feczfjf,1578994351.0,"Or, you know, she just wanted someone to talk to about it since she has no one to tell because her husband is DEAD? SIL wouldn't want OP to keep it a secret if she didn't care about the family's feelings. Can you blame her for wanting to reach out to someone when she's in the middle of grieving and all alone? The husband's family have each other but if SIL is only sharing this information with one person just now then it's safe to say that she's been going through this by herself."
AmItheAsshole,fed0xsl,t1_fecj0qc,1578993161.0,"Yep. And then after going through all of that, she'd have to watch that baby that she almost died for be raised by someone else, with no husband by her side through any of it. I couldn't imagine going through all of the chaos that you went through while also grieving my dead husband, and then giving the baby that I would have raised with him to someone else."
AmItheAsshole,fed0jbd,t1_fecaf6g,1578992593.0,"Basically what I said. Yeah, I would be so upset if I was in her position. She'd be constantly reminded of everything she lost when her husband died, and that situation would probably be even more painful than not having the baby or raising it herself."
AmItheAsshole,feczz1j,t1_fecnomx,1578991815.0,"Yeah, I just tell them that I don't think I could be pregnant and they do the x-ray."
AmItheAsshole,feczwpo,t1_fecuv5x,1578991728.0,Really? Whenever I get an x-ray they just ask me if there's a possibility that I'd be pregnant and I tell them no and they do the x-ray. Never taken a pregnancy test and I'm 18. Maybe the x-rays I got were done very differently and for different purposes. I'm not an expert.
AmItheAsshole,fecziib,t3_eoeslw,1578991195.0,"NAH. I see what your intentions are, but if I was in her situation I would be upset too. If you adopted the kid, SIL would be watching you experience what she could have and would have had with her husband if he was still around. She might regret giving her baby up but feel like she doesn't have a right to be a part of their life because she gave them away, but if she did spend time with the kid, they would also be a reminder that her husband is gone. That's how I would probably feel, anyway. It would possibly be more painful than not having the baby at all or raising it herself."
AmItheAsshole,fecyv9h,t1_fecv9zp,1578990353.0,I feel the same way. Watching your distant family raise the child that you would have raised with your husband if he was still alive. I couldn't handle it.

AskReddit,fecy0ka,t3_eodtd1,1578989247.0,"Omg I just remembered this. So this guy I've known for most of my life (since we were in elementary school) was set up to go to a really good college to become an engineer or something. Not long before he graduated, his new girlfriend told him that she was pregnant.  They only had sex a couple times or maybe only once from what I heard, and they didn't use protection. He decided to stay with her and later she found out that it was probably a false alarm. He didn't go to school, his girlfriend was about to get kicked out as soon as she turned 18, she got fired from her job. He went from having a bright future and a good relationship with his parents to living in a car with a manipulative girlfriend who he's convinced himself he loves and barely speaking to his family anymore. All in the span of a few months. It's just sad cuz our parents have been friends for so long and we were friends for years. Things got complicated and we grew apart but our families still spent a lot of time together and they still get together sometimes, but as far as I know he isn't a part of it anymore. This all happened just last year, we're both 18 and it's sad to know how fast his life went downhill at such a young age."
