I find that Jordan tends to pool all leftist cultural movements into a single box, and indiscriminately labels then as ‘bad’ due to his strange interpretation of ‘cultural Marxism,’ which he sees as a scourge that is dead set on destroying western civilization due to his viewpoints on Communism. 

Because of this, he gets super defensive and irrational about these topics, leading to a lot of false information and strange conclusions. 

For his views on feminism in particular, he holds the somewhat popular view that 3rd-wave feminism (gender pay gap, glass ceiling, sexual harassment) is greatly blown out of proportion, however he conflates that mainstream viewpoint with his general ‘cultural Marxist plot’ worldview, jumping to the conclusion that feminists are malignant and plotting to uproot traditional society. Which is an incredibly far-right viewpoint. 

In general, he’s an incredibly interesting thinker to consider due to his idiosyncratic yet highly educated viewpoints on psychology and sociology, yet due to the idiosyncrasies his world view, he tends to have some large blind spots and strange distortions in his political views.

Psychonaut,ffmsv64,t1_ffmlvya,1580058564.0,"I had a similar, albeit morbid, experience, where I felt that I understood that the greatest possible achievement that humanity could attain would be to become a very simple 4-dimensional being, essentially like an ant to true 4-dimensional beings that would have no qualms with squashing us. The 4-dimensional beings best achievement would be attaining basic 5-dimensional status, and they'd get squashed by 5-dimensional beings, who'd get squashed by 6-dimensional beings, et cetera et cetera ad infinitum. So basically half-way through my trip I was utterly convinced that I was basically the smallest and most meaningless truly sentient being in the universe, which deeply fucked me up during the trip.

Psychonaut,ffmrh4m,t1_ffmm2x8,1580058161.0,"It can though. In convolutional neural networks, for example, if you were to change the weights on an input, you'd lead to a completely different scanned image. 

In our brains, which are essentially just incredibly complicated convolutional neural networks, introducing psychedelics basically is changing the core weights of each and every neural interaction, leading to a completely different firing pattern (read up on initial condition chaos theory), and thus, completely different cognitive information.

I get what you're saying, that since you're not changing the core sensory input you can't get different information, but that's a poor view of how our brain works, as the vast, vast amount of our cognitive sensory experiences and experiences of 'information' are only recognized after passing through layer after layer after layer of neural structuring.

So if you slightly shift the way that each layer interacts with itself, as psychedelics do, you lead to vastly, vastly different final results, which is the new information that psychedelics introduce. 

Seriously, read up on initial conditions in chaos theory, and then apply it to a 10 trillion variable system rather than just the ~10 variable systems that are studied."

For that one in particular, the more you think about it the truer it seems to be, and the more useful it gets. 

His general worldview is quite interesting to tap into from time to time as well. It’s essentially the idea that humanities cultural and psychological development was a Darwinian process that is deeply tied to genetics and evolution, justifying a lot of our traditionalist viewpoints and creating the idea that there is tremendous encoded knowledge in our past. You don’t want to always think that way, as it’s eerily close to Social Darwinism and Nazism, but I think on some level it’s true, and it’s interesting to attack issues from that perspective once in a while. 

Then you get into his viewpoints on modern issues such as feminism and his conflation of leftism with ‘cultural marxism,’ which is fundamentally moronic, and at that point most people either take his ideas as sacrosanct or completely throw the baby out with the bath water and discount all of his ideas immediately.

Psychonaut,ffmgzsc,t1_ffmggfc,1580054563.0,"Well it kinda makes sense. When we’re created in utero, all of our neurological connections are established through reflexive, genetically determined factors, rather than experiential ones. After we’re born, however, this genetic architecture gives way to experiential influences, giving cognitive primacy to experience rather than instinct.

Psychonaut,ffmf05s,t1_ffkyc3l,1580053651.0,"That’s a poor understanding of neurology and the effects of psychedelic drugs. The deeper you go into the subconscious, the more loosely information is encoded and the closer the neural action gets to reflexive randomness. It’s only as we build layers and layers of neural algorithms that cognition and comprehensive informative patterns emerge. 

However, psychedelics directly influence the random reflexive components that make up our subconscious, namely our neurons. So because of that, entirely new neural circuits that have never been activated can form and influence your cognition, leading to the new ideas and insights that we see on psychedelics. 

It’s basically chaos theory. Our mind is a 10 trillion component machine, so changing the basic components of the interaction between those 10 trillion parts (synapses) leads to incredibly different outcomes and ideas."

DPDR is the minds natural response to incomprehensible stress, which is what a lot of the psychedelic experience is. It is basically a borehole into the Buddhist insight of no-self, except it’s not done gradually by softening your conception of your ‘self’ but instead quickly by psychedelics picking you up and chucking you into the cave of DPDR. 

Find peace in the cave, relax, and orient your life towards bettering yourself (do yoga.) and you’ll feel better.
