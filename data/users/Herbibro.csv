Still, I’ll never get over the fact that I got yelled at for opening a panel to take a picture of a terminal block strip once. didnt even touch anything except the flathead screwdriver to open the door. Blew my mind."
pics,ff6awrk,t1_ff67gab,1579623184.0,"Heavily depends on the job, but you’re generally correct. I did my engineering internship in a massive metal milling plant. even though I had the ability to critically fuck shit up within a PLC program, I wasnt allowed to so much as open a control panel. Had to ask electricians every single time I wanted to see anything or risk being written up/told to leave for “stealing labor”. I get it, but goddamn it’s annoying.

Now that I’m full time, i work at a smaller company. Only a few hundred employees. I do product design work and sometimes that involves building the prototypes myself. Definitely learned the value of good tools at this job; it’s hard to appreciate until you do it yourself. You have to break some shit to know what’s crap and what works."

news,fedwvna,t1_fedtvgb,1579021596.0,"My biggest issue with this argument was that it’s REALLY asking a lot to train people who’ve done nothing but mine coal for 20 years to learn how to do shit like computer programming. I remember seeing something about how the retention rates for those training programs were horrifically low. It seems like it would be tough to find an industry for these workers that actively needs them while also making sure that a fair percentage of them stick with it. 

Imagine you have 80% retention, you can conceivably blame the 20% for quitting when they had a chance. 10% retention, can you really blame 9/10 people for “not adapting”? Just something to consider."

gadgets,fdqohce,t1_fdpybth,1578671440.0,"My “tennis racket” electric swatter is powered off of 3V, 2 AA batteries in series. However, it has a flyback transformer circuit (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_transformer) that outputs to the metal screens for shocking the bugs. My meter won’t measure the voltage on that screen, it just gets upset with me. It’s well over 600 volts at a medium-low frequency (a few kHz most likely) though you and I both know it doesn’t have near enough power to supply enough continuous current to do any real damage. At worst, you get a singe from an arc."

Not the case for everyone, but ive literally saved nearly $60 (cost of membership) this year on gas alone just by filling up when I go there. Normally gas around me is like 20-30 cents cheaper there and I have a 15 gallon tank. I definitely end up spending more there because the gas gets me to go there for a “small trip” which is the biggest lie ive ever told myself"
