offmychest,fftnqda,t3_euvnoe,1580225149.0,"i didn't even know about the rape case until someone i follow posted about it, then i basically all lost respect for him. he literally said ""she wasn't even that attractive,"" as well as, ""i didn't even finish/i jerked off when she left"" like what the fuck? people really let him get away with that? i feel sorry for his family and the family of the other victims, but not for him."

offmychest,ffrylze,t3_euofsg,1580168878.0,"i love dogs but i do agree with you. and it sucks to see owners like that - what if you're letting your dog run free and he bites someone, and then your dog has to be put down? it happens a lot. it's a lot safer and easier to just keep them on a leash, even if the dog doesn't like it."
