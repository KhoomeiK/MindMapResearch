meirl,ff45kbk,t1_ff2krg2,1579556026.0,"But what's so wrong with that scene? Is it that I enjoy simpler things like battling metal tops rather than worry about dying alone? I have a $2,000 custom guitar made in Italy with the Green Lantern symbol on the neck, and I've made more than that back playing it at shows and in studio sessions; is it really such a bad thing that I also enjoy reading the comics?

I work hard every day for what most people would consider childish things, but if that's what it takes to be happy and alone, then why not? I have become the person I enjoy spending time with the most because I do what makes me happy. I dig trenches and form slopes at work, then come home excited to play some music, or read some comics, smoke some pot, jack off, and go to sleep with a smile on my face ready for tomorrow.

I play rock shows at local bars on the weekend when I'm not doing recording or producing, then I head home to my farm and swing my lightsaber around in the dark. I'm not living the best life, but at least I'm happy. So when you picture me surrounded by my toys, why does that have to be such a bad thing to imagine?"
meirl,ff453st,t1_ff0live,1579555735.0,"Did you get the impression that I'm not alone? I'm just saying being alone isn't a bad thing at all. Everyone always talks about being alone like it's such a bummer, but it's not at all when you can be the one the make yourself happy. Yeah, I'm a grown man-child, I'm also a heavy equipment operator for a multi-million dollar contract crew and a studio session musician and producer, it takes a lot of hard work to be a professional nerd, but at least I'm happy man"
meirl,ff0cvni,t1_feypcno,1579467664.0,"Fuck that noise. I look into my music studio and I see what I'm doing that shit for. I look at my comic collection, and my replica lightsabers, and my Beyblades, and I know why I do this shit. Just find what makes you happy"
Whatcouldgowrong,fevu8ry,t1_fevmr67,1579401573.0,"I haven't been living in it, living in it was the entire reason there has been a societal change in gears. And again, I'm not against it. I wouldn't mind spending a ton of time with my kids, of course it's work, but so is everything. I'd trade beating my body up every day to be able to stay at the house and maintain it. Maybe I have been living in the 50's because I don't see why people stopped being happy with that setup. Of course now with cost of living, both partners have to work anyways so it's difficult to have an old-school lifestyle, so it's a moot point I guess."
Whatcouldgowrong,feuvyc5,t1_feut5l7,1579390443.0,"It's kind of a human thing in general to strive to be better than the competition. Women were never conditioned to believe they needed to be better than men. The entire issue has always been that women were conditioned to believe that they needed to stay in the home and maintain the home while the man went out and worked, so quite literally the opposite, they were conditioned to not be better than men.

Any woman who is truly about role reversal and wants to come take my job in construction so that I can chill at home and have a hot meal ready for her when she comes home every day, hit me up."

AskReddit,ferc3qb,t1_fer4ree,1579352259.0,"The ""why"" is because it's someone's fetish. There have been a couple interviews since the video, if I remember right.

Here's an excerpt from an article i just found:

Set during a carefree afternoon in the lives of two faeces-starved young women, 2G1C told the story of how there are no limitations when it comes to two people expressing their love for each other, and how one cup can bring two people together in a bond that is stronger than anything else in the world."

I also found that my menu is different from what was written in the instructions.

Other than that though, it's amazing for what I paid, 3 sound fonts, a decent number of color options, and the blade looks really good!"

By the time we got to the age where kids are like ""let's play with dads guns"", we knew how to take them all apart and clean them, load them, and we knew full well there wasn't any excuse to use them as play toys. We never saw guns as something cool and mysterious the way kids do because (in my dad's words) he had taken the mystery away from them and taught us there wasn't anything unordinary about them as long as we respected them."

AskReddit,fe9h3vg,t1_fe5skif,1578937524.0,"Here's a fuckin story for you: I remember the first time I ever saw tits, I was like 3 years old and my dad was outside mowing the lawn. I was just messing around and started the movie in the VCR. I still remember it pretty clearly: dude and woman are making out in the back of the car, he unbuckles some thigh strap things, whips her tits out, then it shows the limo driver just smiling and nodding like ""yeaaahh"". She gets naked and they go into some hotel place blah blah blah. I had tried finding it several times and never could dig anything up on it.

Anyways, we have a tradition in my family to get together and watch good movies from the 90's. Long story short, a few months ago, I saw the same movie with both of my parents and that scene was exactly how I remembered it shot for shot."
