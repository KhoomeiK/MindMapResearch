Multi-generational deaf families exist."
aww,fdp7nsp,t1_fdop755,1578621911.0,"Yes, deafness can be genetic. 90 to 95% of deaf people have hearing parents, so there is 5 to 10% of deaf people who have deaf parents. I know many multi-generational deaf families. Some deaf people, like myself, have one or two deaf relatives (a sister in my case) among hearing relatives. My sister and I were born deaf or became deaf very soon after birth, and none of us were sick, so we cannot point to anything but genetics, even though nobody else in my family as far as we know are deaf. Wild how that works!"

The full version is so much better, because the baby moved her arm to mimic the sign grandmother."

TheMandalorianTV,fclk3kg,t1_fcldrj4,1577749642.0,"The nice things about made-up signs, everyone can interpret it in any ways and none of us are wrong. With the context provided by Din, we can infer what the gestures might mean. So your translation is not wrong. 

Sometimes, I’ll see actual signs being used incorrectly in TV shows or movies, and that kills me. So painful to watch. I actually watched the scene with Tusken Raiders carefully for any butchered signs and was relieved to see all gestures made up."
TheMandalorianTV,fclbo3l,t1_fcl82yx,1577744106.0,"It is not American Sign Language. I’m a native ASL user and I don’t recognize any signs. Since the actor who plays the Tusken Raider is a deaf American, I’m confident the signs are just made up gestures. Makes sense since it’s not supposed to be set in America where the sign language is ASL. So, no actual translation for the signs. 

Still mad cool that a deaf actor is hired for the role. That usually doesn’t happen in Hollywood."
BeautyGuruChatter,f8x9tgp,t3_e2czch,1574912278.0,"Agreed with the closed captioning. As a Deaf person who wants to enjoy watching videos on YouTube, I get frustrated often when a video has an auto-generated captioning, which is like 99% of YouTube. 

Funny, you mentioned Jackie Aina, because she is actually the only beauty guru I’ve seen so far that does add closed captioning to her videos. She doesn’t have CC added immediately, so I usually have to wait several days or a couple of weeks before I can watch her videos with CC. But she adds CC eventually, which is, to me, better than never, and I appreciate that. No other beauty guru I’ve seen did this.

Edited: I just checked her videos, and all of her recent videos are now captioned."
