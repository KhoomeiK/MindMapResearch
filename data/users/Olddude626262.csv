It's a story of a fictional fishermen in the boom days of Kodiak crabbing."

Did Maggie get all happy and run around after you set the pots and the deck was clear?
I crabbed with a Chesapeake retriever named Johnny and he would celebrate a cleared deck. 
He also helped out by dragging fresh hanging bait (cod fish) out of our way and pile them up for us when we were running gear.

Anyhow, cheers Maggie!"
