If you let it sit for a few weeks to a few months, it will probably get a little bit better. If you have the time/money/patience, you should consider picking up another 5 or 10 of them, and smoke one every few months. Keep a journal with some notes on how well the cigar burns, what flavors you notice, is there pepper or spice? What aromas are you getting. 

These kind of things will change as a cigar ages, and will help to increase your palate for other cigars as well."

So I wrote a tool that monitors my download directory, and when a file is finished downloading, it automatically renames it to the proper Plex format.

cigars,femszyz,t3_eq0cej,1579268753.0,"What's the length/ring guage (approximation)?

Edit: It definitely appears to be one of the 'Perfexcion' lines, as I believe those are the only ones that come with the cedar wrap and red band at the foot. 

The 'Perfecxion X' comes in at 48x6.25"", which I would think is longer and skinnier than the one you have. The 'Perfecxion #2' has a Torpedo tip, so we can safely rule that out as well. 

I think that pretty much just leaves the **'Fuente Opus X Perfecxion No. 4'**, so that's going to be my best guess. It's 42x5 3/16"", which seems about the right length; I can't tell on the ring gauge though... These are hard to find but this site [claims to have them in stock](https://www.cuencacigars.com/arturo-fuente-opus-x-perfecxion-4-cigars-natural-box-of-42/). A box of 42 for $756 would price this cigar at $18 bucks a stick. So your $10 was pretty well spent, my friend."

running,fek6kbs,t1_feju0lc,1579193664.0,"> do I want a running watch that has some smartwatch capabilities, or a smartwatch with fitness apps.

This was the crux of my problem for years. I have tried multiple Android based watches that had fitness capabilities and they always crapped out after a year or so. I recently switched a Garmin 735xt and have loved it. It has the basic notifications ability, such as reading texts and incoming calls, but blows any other smart watch out of the water on fitness tracking. Haven't regretted the purchase at all, and will be sticking with Garmins for the foreseeable future."

> It took 10 days to get away from any doubts: Fernando is also strong in the rally raids, after winning in F1 and Endurance, risking doing so also at the Indianapolis 500, his next goal. In the camper, which is his home in this Dakar, the serene and light gaze, Alonso begins to tell. Of what he is experiencing. And what will come.

> **Fernando, you have always lived a high speed life. The Dakar is very different, it is above all management, regularity and adaptation to opposite situations.**

> ""Yes, this was a big change, it is a race where a long-term vision is needed. In this, the Dakar is one of the biggest challenges, you don't always have to drive 100%, but 80%. Steps from 20 minutes spent at 150 an hour in a valley, at an hour at 15 hours doing trials between the rocks. Adapting is difficult, but now I feel inside the race, ready to win. ""

> **The Dakar, then the 500 Miles. True goal of the year.**

> ""Yes. The Dakar is a personal challenge, being fast in a rally car. It is an adventure, but winning the 500 Miglia is a more competitive challenge. Victory is the only goal there. I am close to closing to race with the Andretti team "".

> **He is 38 years old, early for retirement. What other challenges do you have in mind?**

> ""Now only the 500 Miglia. After May it will be time to make an important decision for 2021, even if I haven't thought about it yet. In 2019, without Formula 1 I was very busy: Endurance, Daytona, the preparation of the Dakar. This year I don't want to make plans for after Indy, but to think well about 2021: think about whether I want to return to F1 for a few more years, I'm not too old, or play the entire Indy championship, or race with the Hypercar in the Wec ...
