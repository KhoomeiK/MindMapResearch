type2diabetes,fepjp46,t3_eq8fhr,1579322254.0,"It helped me to stop buying things. If they weren't in the house, I didn't crave them. 
In the beginning,  I tested my glucose levels 6 times a day, and kept a food log. All of that help educate me on how different foods impacted my glucose levels.  I now know how many slices of pizza to have, what chips are ok, what amount of rice is doable. If no one has suggested  a food log, I highly recommend newbies do the same. Yes it's a pain but the depression fades when you educate yourself about your body & it's so empowering. 
Good luck."
