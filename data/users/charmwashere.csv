It is more common for people to correct others when they first say things in years vs months at this age. Not sure why people are giving OP grief over this"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fckmsf0,t1_fck9ueb,1577728717.0,Ty for that TIL ☺️
facepalm,fc9ynrl,t1_fc8yoog,1577560177.0,"Lol not at all but if you decide to do a politically incorrect, bad taste, insensitive joke expect some backlash. The person's response was not that crazy. If some white dude said the same thing that the chick in the Hijab said reaction would be way stronger. There is a reason racist, misogynistic, low brow jokes are not that popular with the general public."
Ophthalmology,fc7qnto,t1_fc6ut1k,1577516174.0,"I'm sure there is something about oils. Yes, I have had a patient say she put oils around her eyes to try to fix the issue naturally ....sigh..."
facepalm,fc7p6pm,t1_fc6p92x,1577514933.0,"Well...yes, it's obvious what it is. I think the girl responding understands it was supposed to be a joke as well,she just didn't find it funny. Especially since so many women across the globe are still in serious  threat. I also think she took it personally because they might both be from cultures where civil rights are still being fought and she feels she should know better."
SubredditDrama,fc7jmks,t1_fc64nia,1577509522.0,I see this a lot. Maybe my age range or demographic plays apart in this but I have hardly ever heard of females actively turning away droves of guys because of their height. Most of us are fine as long as the guy doesn't get pissed when we opt for high heels ( in regards to height) . The few times I've herd girls say anything were either  superficial vapid self absorbed females who would be a horrible partner anyways or girls that were super tall and they felt way insecure about their height not the other way around.
AskMen,fc3ji8l,t1_fadtcws,1577391175.0,"Hmmm after reading my comment again, it sounds a bit dismissive which wasn't my intention. I understand that this has become a big concern for many men which is why I reacted the way I did. Mainly because I think ( which is totally a biased opinion and may not reflect the truth of the matter ) that this was a small issue that somehow morphed into this big thing due to echo chambers. Again, regions and age group could play a really big difference. I grew up in the West coast, a teen in the 90's when internet dating was just starting to think about becoming a thing. Most people still hooked up by physically spending time around people which meant personality and style went a long way. Internet dating is extremely superficial which highlights *everyone's* faults causing more self esteem disorders. Also, hooking up on the internet or allowing most of your social experiences behind the screen makes it harder to evolve socially and gain confidence. I embarrassed myself like crazy in middle school and high school but I also learned from those mistakes allowing me to figure out what works and what doesn't. Due to some childhood PTSD, my maturity was stunted in some ways but if I hadn't fucked up a lot and then took the time to learn the lesson from those fuck ups I would not have the confidence I finally gained in my late 20's. I feel kids/young adults today don't get to experience the fuck up, learn from it, and then everyone kinda forgets about said fuck up allowing you to move on stages. Which , in turn, makes finding people to date and socialize with IRL even way more harder on people."

extroverts,fc3hft5,t1_fbeqcqt,1577389875.0,Good luck with everything! Keep me posted on how your doing!! ☺️
Christianity,fc3h4o6,t1_fbeqvcu,1577389681.0,"Do you think we can? Not being snarky but honestly wondering. It seems EVERYthing has become polarized. Even once safe topics like the weather is polarized lol. But I would love to try. I think it is important that people realize that being a ""Christian"" doesn't mean a blanket religion, that there are many many different beliefs and understanding those differences do mean some very different fundamentals.  Yet I also would like to see Christians being more tolerate of each other differences and be willing to challenge their own beliefs without fear or anger. I would really love to see Christians find a universal, positive, goal despite the differences, something that can unit all Christians world over."
MedicalGore,fc3g9hq,t1_fbxaxqg,1577389134.0,Lmao @ edit !! That has happened to me before too lmao disregard my comment all but the happy holidays!
tooktoomuch,fc3ccj4,t1_fc2o6rw,1577386665.0,"My mistake then. when you used the word ""claiming"" i interpreted it as being very dismissive of the diagnosis. I would not say it was ""willfully ignorant"". I feel you used that phrase to try to goat me into a defensive position, which is not very helpful to the conversation. Either way, support for the dismissal of the ADD diagnosis should have secondary information as to why it should be dismissed and not just  blanket statements as to that point of view. So yes,please share any information you have that will support your claims that people with severe chronic ADD should not take any medication as well as why severe chronic ADD should be downgraded to something trivial ( if that is your stance, I'm assuming that last part, I will admit).

As for Adderall being the same as tweek in chemical components is just not true. If you want to to talk about  how stimulates affect the brain and body in a physiological arena then yes,most stimulates work in three different manners. But that is for all stimulates including beta 2- stimulants or steroids ( not the illicit kind, which is also a stimulant, but I am specifically speaking of steroids used for anti-inflammatory properties) just to varying degrees. 

After viewing your history I understand your passion for the microbiome. Which is valid and I think can do wonders if and by itself for many issues, not limited to psychiatric concerns. However, like most things in medicine, especially concerning people with severe and/or chronic conditions it is never a one stop answer. Usually to maintain a active, quality driven, normal-ish lifestyle one needs to do a plethora of things. One of those things is usually meds. The other is exercise and good diet. Any psychiatrist or psychologist worth any thing will tell you this. Both which help maintain and support a healthy microbiome. For some severe cases fecal transplants have been successful but it still does not have a good success rate for issues concerning the mind. For GI issues, fecal transplants are the new go to if you can afford it."
tooktoomuch,fbzngs7,t1_fbz9a2r,1577252842.0,Oh? Can you give sources stating ADD isn't a real diagnosis? That there is no physiological components pertaining to ADD? And Adderall isnt tweek lol
tooktoomuch,fbxbxmo,t1_fbbkbsk,1577179180.0,"I am an anxious weed smoker. Hard core paranoia, heart pounding, beginnings of migraines, ugh it's awful. People thought I was tweeking I was so paranoid. I know if I really wanted to invest the time and money I could probably find one that works but it's just not that important to me. On the other hand I do fine with edibles if I watch the dosage ."
tooktoomuch,fbxbhyx,t1_fbf3v1l,1577178523.0,Yeah but you don't see her with that nervous tic when she is speaking in from of cameras in other vids.
tooktoomuch,fbxbg41,t1_fbhwnp3,1577178445.0,ADD is a real thing my friend. There are legit physiological signs concerning ADD. It just got a bad rap because it was over diagnosed at one time but don't let that deter you from the fact that it is a real and very frustrating diagnosis to live with.
MedicalGore,fbxa6o3,t1_fbx96oo,1577176576.0,"If I may...it could be because of the tone that  is being perceived concerning your post. It could be interpreted as being dismissive of OP and slightly condescending. Your information is not wrong. There is not a cookie cutter female format. What is normal for some is abnormal to others. Having a good relationship with your doctor and being able to get educated about your body is very important. So I think it was just how people are perceiving the overall tone. No worries. This has happened to me too. Sometimes we just write things down in a hurry and may not realize how it comes across. Don't delete it, though, because that is even worse then just taking the downvotes lol.  Just ride it out and keep it in mind for the future.  I know this is a weird Segway but Happy holidays , Hun.🥂 I hope you have a good one 😊"
MedicalGore,fbx90ya,t1_fbx3btd,1577174907.0,"No, this is totally normal for most women. But I always encourage conversations with your doctor regardless."
