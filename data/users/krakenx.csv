If you limit yourself to programs available in the GUI based package repositories and don't need to do anything beyond what those programs offer, it's easier than Windows.  You don't need to individually browse to the websites for Libre Office, VLC, Gimp, etc.  All the programs can update them selves at the same time along with the OS.  

The second you try to go beyond the simple use cases Linux breaks down though.  It works great for people who just need a web browser and word processor, and it's also great for people who know enough to compile the kernel from source.  

However, for people in the middle who want to do things like install random programs from the internet, it's still quite difficult to hunt down hundreds of dependencies and libraries and break your system when they conflict with each other.  Flatpacks (slimmed down distros sent along with the program) should help compatibility a lot though."

worldpolitics,ffivp7a,t1_ffhtshc,1579983837.0,"The stock market is the only investment that beats inflation.  Of course it goes up when interest rates for CDs, savings accounts and bonds are so low that they aren't options. It's a rigged Casino with penalties for anyone who refuses to gamble in it.  

Worse, the Stock Market forces companies to persue short term profits no matter the cost to their employees, customers, the environment, our political system, or society at large.

Celebrating stock market growth is like celebrating the growth of a cancerous tumor.  But also like a cancer, removing it has a very high chance of killing it's host.  With 401k and IRAs replacing both pensions and social security, fixing the stock market is going to hurt a lot of people. People
 who did nothing  wrong besides make the only retirement choice they had available."
worldpolitics,ffiuwsz,t1_ffhsqxg,1579983329.0,"Trump's slogan that got him elected was ""make America great again"".  Obama's slogan was ""hope and change"" and that got him elected too.  

The idea that things are horribly broken and we need major changes to fix them is pretty much universal across conservatives, independents and liberals.  There is just a lot of confusion about what changes should be made, and both whether they will help at all, and who they will benefit."

The sad thing is that they now have many really good originals, but the new recommendation system is so bad that they don't even recommend me originals that I'd like, just whatever garbage they feel the need to promote right now.  Often I open Netflix but can't find anything and watch something else entirely. I guess that saves them money since I haven't cancelled though..."

Of course Microsoft and Google both have an army of lobbyists now, so they can do whatever they want now."

Hillary had full control over the encryption, backups, etc. so when she deleted many thousands of emails, even the FBI couldn't recover them.  It was so secure that she got off from Destruction of Evidence charges because it was impossible to prove what she deleted.  

Meanwhile Ivanka and Jared's emails in gmail can be accessed freely by Google, whoever manages their backups, their advertising partners, etc."

It's not that they are too hard or complex to repair, it's that they are built to be impossible to repair without special codes and equipment that the manufacturer deliberately restricts.  If a farmer or repair shop does repair the equipment without authorization, they can be sued for lots of money.
