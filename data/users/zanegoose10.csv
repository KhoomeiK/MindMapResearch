relationship_advice,feylx9z,t3_eqvfzt,1579447367.0,"Basically what I got from this is you'd rather have the guy that treats you like shit but gives you amazing sex, rather than the guy who treats you good and is th2 ""perfect bf"" just because he can't give you good sex? To me that's pretty shitty. I'd feel awful if I was that guy and a girl who I genuinely love left me because of some part of me I can't control"

relationship_advice,fcpm7dj,t3_ei55b8,1577867342.0,"Why are you with this asshole? 1 he doesn't sound like he listens to obvious reasoning from your side, 2 he isn't trying to ask when this was and trying to get the full story if its true (it probably isn't), 3 if it could've been you and it was before you two were dating (it probably wasn't you) I can understand being upset but ending a 8 year relationship from something that happened before you two were dating seems kinda dumb"
