Equestrian,fdkq1yi,t3_els14e,1578508778.0,I'm glad you waited till he was at least three. Some trainers start way too early when the growth plates aren't fully connected. Can lead to injuries and lameness.  He's pretty handsome.  Good luck.

Jot down anytime you feel one of them and that will help you keep track.  The drug they have me to build my white blood cells was what hurt like a son of a gun.  I could feel my achy bones.
