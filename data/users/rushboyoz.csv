trance,fft4iyq,t3_euqu94,1580206706.0,"I'm 48 and have been a huge fan of trance since I was in my early 20's. So 25 years I guess. Probably my first album I listened to over and over was Wildlife on One by Art of Trance.

But I'm pretty sure I was listening to other trancey stuff even before then. Kaleidoscope, from that album, was introduced to me through an Amiga demo. And it happened to also be the first song I ever converted from a CD track into mp3.. using a DOS prompt!

Those were the days..."

patientgamers,feuc686,t3_eqj99i,1579385187.0,"My god you’re describing a good part of my waking life! No one has done that before “certain specific memories of a video game that I associate with moments of my life”. 

The associations / memories are always positive and often associated with the time of day (normally late afternoon) or the weather / cloud patterns.  I’ll often use the associations to get through a boring or difficult part of the day “my happy place,” I suppose. 

Just yesterday I was outside eating lunch and I had this association with Skyrim and FFVII. I immediately usually think “Right, later on I’ll boot up and play Skyrim and / or FFVII all the way through (or part way),” but never do as I have more important things to do. Or keep playing the games I’m currently working through (eg SwSh). 

Its just amazing that you’ve put to words something I regularly feel on a daily basis!!!"

AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fcw5mta,t3_ej1wrh,1578017711.0,"I was going to say, that this meme specifically doesn't apply to Odyssey because of its ability to apply any armor skin to what you are currently wearing. Its like how all games should be !"
