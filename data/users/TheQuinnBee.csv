I'd rather have a stable job with a company that has been doing well in the industry for x amount of years over a company in its infancy. Even if it's a really cool gig, part of being an adult and having a family is recognizing that your dream job is not worth the potential damage both financially and psychologically to your children.

There are SO many non profitable start ups that fold. And then you're out of a job, no severence, no insurance, with kids to feed and a mortgage to pay."

1) Ownership was never confirmed

2) Microchip was never scanned

3) Owner was never contacted

4) Dog was altered despite there being an active owner

5) Dog was sold within a week of it being surrendered despite the active owner attempting to reclaim the dog.

That said, I don't think it's right that someone who does not make as much as I do has to choose between food and medicine or play the popularity game that is gofundme to not die from cancer.

And all that would take is a billionaire having *slightly* less money. They wouldn't even notice it and they'd save lives.

Adopting an adult dog is hard because you don't know where it came from or what happened to it. And the dog really is a sweet boy. He's just a bit overprotective of his pack.
