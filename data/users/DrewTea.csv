The chinese food does suck - but Apple Valley has a decent buffet, and Crystal Jade delivers some decent grub. 

I think the biggest thing is that you can find nearly all of these things you ask for in a quick drive - Eagan's just not that big.  Axel's is 10min one way, Burnsville options are 10 minutes in another, and Apple Valley is 10 minutes in yet another."

The law is not definitively on the side of the MAS/State Fair, as their quasi-state existence is codified in law and there are actual legal repercussions for violating State Fair policies - thus making them a state agency.

As for Indian food, the population in Eagan has given rise to some very authentic and delicious options that I think would favorably compare to anything in Minneapolis."
TwinCities,ff63isp,t1_ff54rkz,1579618226.0,"Obviously not.  The parks are some of the best in the city, the Indian food is great even if the restaurant selection isn't that large, (but you can get to Burnsville in 5 minutes and find anything else you want) minimal crime, decent roads, great schools, quick drive to a number of attractions. 

So what if the nightclub scene isn't hopping."

AskAnAmerican,feti6ma,t1_fetaa43,1579375672.0,"My experience is that the US has less racism in general than Europe, it's just that incidents are highlighted and focused on far more.  

In Europe they don't even consider their prejudices to be 'racism' per se as their behavior and stereotypes are far more historically ingrained into their cultures.  They are far more ignorant about their behavior and the ramifications of such than almost any American I've met."
liberalgunowners,fesxjif,t1_feo69se,1579369946.0,"My wife's experience is along the same lines as the OP.  

Coming from a country that was at war when she was born, she was a refugee that lived in 3 different countries, speaks 5 languages, and worked hard to get her education opportunities which eventually led to her coming to the US and gaining her citizenship. 

She has absolutely no sympathy for illegal immigrants, but it's 'expected' by liberals that as an immigrant she should, and when she shuts them down for associating her with illegal immigrants, or conflating her experience with that of an illegal, it's clear that she's broken the 'code'.  

 At that point they treat her as if she's a Trump supporter."

TwinCities,fedozxs,t1_fecg0fb,1579016757.0,"People don't realize this aspect - the administration at post-secondary institutions continues to grow and grow.  Go look at how much faculty there are at UMN vs how many people are employed there. 

The other dirty secret is that the US has this idea that everyone needs to go to college - and we send about 65% of high school students there each year, but only about half of them manage to complete their education, despite a plethora of (dubious) non-STEM educational paths with coursework that isn't particularly strenuous.  Billions of dollars are spent supporting the additional faculty, administration, and infrastructure for millions of students that just went there because of social pressure and a romanticized ideal. 

People always point to countries like Germany which have low or no-cost tuition, but they either don't know, or ignore, that only 30% of high schoolers continue on to post-secondary education after rounds of strenuous entrance examinations and the offering of technical education options in the last years of high school.

Minneapolis,fecj8i5,t3_eo935f,1578975238.0,"Persian food is delicious, and Caspians is definitely the best in the city (IMO) but care should be taken when referring to these foods as strictly 'Iranian.' 

As the Persian Empire included a large swath of territory and accompanying cultures - Greek, Armenian, Kurdish, Assyrian, Lebanese, Syrian, etc, it's really hard to pin down any true origination for these dishes. 

In fact you'll find that any and all of these cultures will claim to be the originators of kebabs, dolma, etc.  And all of them have some claim to them, as they've been a part of their ethnic memories for a thousand years. 

The likelyhood of these dishes originating from Iran is just as likely or unlikely as they are from any of the other cultures that claim them.  Assigning these dishes to one particular modern nation is, in a sense, a cultural reappropriation."

armenia,fe2jig9,t1_fe08tr6,1578839121.0,"Your New York example is a good choice, as it's the remains of a 17th century bar and other clear areas where people lived and worked, far more interesting than a dark tunnel to somewhere. And it's also a good example about how obscure it is, and that despite an interesting subject it seems to attract little real interest. 

Garni is another example of this - of all the people who visit the temple, only a fraction of those bother to wander the ruins, and fewer still check out the baths.  

I'd be more in favor of this effort if the buildings were clearly domiciles or meeting places, or if there were interesting architecture or even some old facades, (and to be clear, that may exist there but not shown in the photos) but old sewers are a minor curiosity at best. 

If increasing tourism is the goal, then there are better ways to do that."

Firearms,fbrzhoa,t1_fbqaq7v,1577048201.0,"Here's a clue - most liberals are NOT inherently anti-gun.  There is a tremendously loud minority backed by big money and sympathetic big-city media.

What they are is undeducated about some of the most basic concepts regarding firearms. 

They don't know that semiautomatic firearms have been around for over 100 years - they think they're a more recent invention.

They don't know the real definition of an 'assault rifle', and they don't understand why two rifles that look exactly the same operate differently. 

They think that people can buy the fully automatic firearms they see on CBS/ABC/NBC/ETC and the movies. 

A good share of them don't understand basic concepts of civics and law.  Nevermind the second amendment, they don't understand due process.

They think that hunters are all using single-shot bolt-action firearms because the same media mentioned above tells them so, and romanticizes that idea (when they're not stereotyping hunters as drunk idiots falling out of tree stands)

Now, there *IS* something to be said about the rampant partisanship, posturing, militancy, and 'cold dead hands' expressions driving potential allies away.  

There are plenty of gun owners who aren't fire-breathing 2nd Amendment champions, and don't want to be. There are plenty of potential gun owners that may be interested in guns, but are most defintely NOT interested in being forced into a specific political identity.

There is sound strategic thinking in cultivating left-wing gun owners, not as a way to turn them into right-wingers, but to act as a bulwark within their own sociopolitical groups.

Some of the most successful gun groups out there right now - the ones bringing in new blood, educating them, and increasing the amount of ownership across all demographics - are non-partisan, non-militant, non-confrontational."
