DiWHY,ff1ndde,t1_fezg8w7,1579482055.0,"There are several cleaners out there that work. There is a thing called an X-1 , by Simonis, and it gets the fine dust off. It has to be replaced pretty often, but it’s what they use at the Mosconi cup. It’s about $85.00. 

I change my cloth fairly regularly. I used to use Kamui chalk, but the residue it left under the cloth was just too much for me. The makeup-type chalks are hard on the cloth. 

I am lucky to have a professional guy who is amazing at changing cloth. I also only use Simonis- it’s expensive,  but it’s worth it. I think last time I got Championship cloth. It’s super nice. 

I will lightly vacuum the rails if I feel they need it. I try not to vacuum the table, as I feel it pulls the weave of the cloth. 

If the cloth is older, I might use a foam based cleaner and a big soft mop thing to get a better clean. Pool Dawg has it. 

It’s also really important to keep the balls clean. There is a set of cleaners out there by Aramith. I use that and a fluffy microfiber cloth to keep the balls clean. I don’t have a ball cleaner, but those work great, too. Expensive, though. 

Hope that helps!"

You may never find the exact design, because there are few records. I have sold multiple Weiss pieces, and I would put this in my shop at maybe $30.00. (Without seeing it, of course) 

Moisture is the enemy of costume jewelry. If you get any of those little silica packets in shoes or other products, tuck one in the box with this. 

Don’t use perfume, hairspray, or other solvents after putting it on. It should be the last thing on before you are out the door. 

Never wear in the shower, or swimming, etc. 

After wearing, wipe with a SLIGHTLY damp cloth, top and bottom, to remove skin oils or makeup. 

Keep it wrapped in a soft, lint free cloth, laid flat. But please wear it, too. These were made to be enjoyed."

I spent my time opening more shops, and learning about Etsy. In a way, it was a blessing. I got out of the forums and started treating it like a business. I was on several teams, and that helped.
