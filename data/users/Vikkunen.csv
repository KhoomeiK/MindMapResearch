City of Ithaca and Village of Cayuga Heights are expensive AF.  Town of Ithaca and Lansing are more reasonable, and there are downright bargains if you go 10-20m outside town to Brooktondale, Dryden, Newfield, Trumansburg, etc.

The pay range is low compared to what you would expect in a city, but Cornell (and other major employers in town -- the school district and hospital system) can get away with it because they know they've got a captive audience of very intelligent and capable people who are stuck in the region due to spouses and partners affiliated with either Cornell or IC.

But I also think the thing that set Rivera apart from everyone else and made him the first unanimous selection was the fact he never (apart from when he blew out his Achilles during what was going to be his final season) had a bad year.  

If you look at the other great players who probably should have been unanimous but weren't, they all had baggage:

* Griffey was objectively bad almost every year from 2001 onward, averaging roughly 3/4 of a WAR each year for the final decade of his career.
* Tom Seaver played in an era when ""counting stats"" were all that really mattered and ended his career with a string of ten Jekyll and Hyde seasons that included multiple years of negative W/L ratios and declining peripherals (K/9, H/9).  WAR didn't exist back then, but even that was wildly erratic over his final ten years... although with an average WAR of a bit over 3, he's better than a lot of guys on this list.
* Nolan Ryan was a great pitcher but fell victim to the same problem as Seaver.  He threw 7 no-hitters and struck out over 5700 hitters, but he lost nearly as many games as he won and walked almost 5 batters per 9 innings in an era where ""counting stats"" were all that mattered.
* Cal Ripkin Jr.  Iron Man, all-time great, first-ballot Hall of Fame, Elite from 83-91, but above average from 92-96 and below average for the final five years that he played.
* George Brett, same story.   Was an above average to elite player from 75-86 but then ended his career with seven years of average- to below-average play.
* Hank Aaron didn't have much of a drop-off until the final two or three years of his career and probably has the best argument to be a unanimous pick out of all these guys, but he was a black man who broke a beloved white man's cherished record during an era when a lot of people still weren't ready for that.
* Tony Gwynn was hurt the last few years of his career and never had the sexy power numbers that appealed to voters before advanced metrics.  Hell, even by advanced metrics he's a solidly unexceptional hall of famer at just 69 WAR.
* Randy Johnson's ERA ballooned at he end of his career.
* Greg Maddux same story.
* The list goes on and on."

After the second half of his career, I think Pujols will be a solid 90%er.  There's no doubt he deserves to get in on the first ballot, but a significant number of writers will penalize the fact that he's been a below-average to average player for most of his time in Anaheim.

The jury is out on Trout.  Again, he's a shoe-in to make it in based on his numbers until now.  But if he gets hurt and/or starts cranking out 1- or 2-WAR seasons (or worse!) for the better part of a decade at the end of his career, people will hold it against him when his name appears on the ballot."

Things come up in the meantime, but taking on $40k worth of debt to do a complete gut job on your kitchen because you don't like your stove is just dumb.  If it dies tomorrow, you can get by with instant pot meals for a few weeks while you watch for a used-but-functional one to pop up on FB.

personalfinance,fdswyre,t1_fdsrjk1,1578709020.0,"I know nothing of your overall financial situation, so I can only speculate.  But financing the reno without tapping into your home's equity means it would be unsecured debt, which is akin to putting it on a credit card.  

Since it's unsecured, they can't take your house/car/etc to get their money back if you stop paying, so they're going to demand a much higher interest rate to account for the increased risk.  Probably not credit card high, but still in the neighborhood of 10-12%.  They're also going to insist on a pretty short repayment period... Probably no longer than five years.

Payments on a 5-year, $40k loan at 11% would be around $870/mo, which I'm guessing is about half of your current mortgage payment.

You might be able to find a contractor who will finance the work, but even then they would probably want a sizable downpayment and a shorter term.  I think companies around here offer 36 months or so, for what that's worth, which is around $1200 on a $40k job.

Which is all a roundabout way of saying you lose your house by biting off more debt than you can handle rather than waiting a couple of years until you can pay in cash and the fads will have all changed anyway."
personalfinance,fdsqucs,t1_fdspqp5,1578706759.0,"Renovation loans are typically secured by your home's equity (if you don't pay them back, they will sell your house).  But since you didn't put any money down and have only owned the home a year, you *have no* equity to speak of.  

Unless you have something else of value (land, jewelry, Magic cards) they can put a lien against to secure the loan, you're going to have a hard time borrowing that much money at a manageable interest rate.

Pragmatically speaking, take a deep breath, wait another year or two, and save the money to pay most or all out of pocket.  Any loan you can get right now is liable to have a predatory rate that will put you forever in debt over a souped up kitchen in a house you soon won't be able to afford.

Is doing this kitchen reno right now worth losing your forever home over?  Because borrowing stupid amounts of money to upgrade a house you just bought and have zero equity in is the homeowner equivalent of an E-2 financing a nine-year-old Bootstang at 18% right out of basic."
