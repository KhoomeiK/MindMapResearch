politics,fdoft6b,t3_embjqn,1578604272.0,"this is incredibly over-simplistic. We don't even audit the rich now because it's too time consuming and the IRS is already overloaded. If we create a complex tax system were we have to audit every possession of the rich, while they will obviously try to find loopholes, it will end up being a gigantic quagmire of taxpayers funds just to reap what we can while investments and charitable donations may go down. 

I think we should find a way to equitable tax the wealthy but I haven't heard a compelling route to that end which won't have the burden of consequences which will fall to the poorest among us."
