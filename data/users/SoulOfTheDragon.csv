europe,ffffqmk,t1_ffepi1l,1579882981.0,"Only reason to ditch 3,5mm jack is money. It's always the money. 

 1. Manufacturer now saves cent or two per manufactured device due to less parts. That times few million devices = $$$
 2. They can sell expensive adapters for even more $$$
 3. New BT headphone/headsets have really high mark-ups which the company and other retailers and sell for major profit = $$$$
 4. Technology on these BT audio systems is degrading by time forcing people to ""upgrade"" towards new expensive audio systems way faster than if they were using standard audio gear. (Good example is battery which is sealed in to the body and non-replaceable. It degrades greatly even in one year)

- Also something to note is the audio quality. With BT headphones you have to include DAC, AMP and so on in the headphone/receiver unit. Those are expensive components and something where it is easy to save lot of money on both phone and headphone side. 
With 3,5mm jack your phone has the chips in them and they are usually high quality. Headphones only need drivers which play the analog signal. 

- Connectivity: 3,5mm is universal analog standard that fits to pretty much any audio device regardless the age. BT is digital transfer system with zero compatibility unless transfer protocol and codec matches. Also it may or may not have data/quality loss depending on how transfer is done."
