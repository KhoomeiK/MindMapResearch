AskReddit,fdd3ihs,t1_fdcmdzk,1578293280.0,"I see. Well, I included New Zealand as example because the country was named in the 2019 Global Peace Index. 

However, I do think the Index mainly focuses on countries international involvements rather than its domestic conflicts. 

Keep in mind that no country is perfect and no country is free of crime. 
That’s a Utopia that will never exist.

New Zealand in my opinion is the closest thing this world will have to a Utopia.
The fact that almost the entire nation responded to the Muslim terrorist attacks with so much support and love to the victims and families of the victims pretty much solidified that idea for me. 
I’ve never heard of any country practically unanimously vowing to protect and care for a community that are pretty much foreign like that before. Reading those articles back then completely blew me away."
AskReddit,fdcteov,t1_fdcnfcl,1578283788.0,You’re correct. New Zealand is with the commonwealth too.

Showerthoughts,fd53pm4,t3_ejzfph,1578173911.0,That’s pretty insensitive.... I know that it’s a joke but I just don’t find it funny. I guess it stops being funny when you have friends and families that have lost their homes to the fires. It also stops being funny when you see blanket of smoggy looking clouds in a city in other country that wouldn’t normally so cloudy and gloomy in this time of year....

Advice,fcj75t3,t3_eh6f14,1577678950.0,"Girl, you’re 21 years old. Why would your father not trust your judgement? Is he particularly religious? Maybe ask him what kind of man he thinks would be best for you and carry out the conversation from there. If he reacts negatively to the question then don’t tell him you have a man. And if he asks why just say that you’ve been thinking about dating.

You could also do what my cousin did too. He rocked on up to his parents house and introduced them to his wife haha."
offmychest,fc7dj8e,t3_egchqy,1577504250.0,At least you’re feeling remorse about it. It would be a concern if you didn’t. But just remember that it wasn’t your fault and that pigeons are really really stupid.
Advice,fbx5blo,t3_eeokc3,1577169992.0,"That part about you handing your phone to her unlocked is a bullshit excuse. She shouldn’t have read your private messages. 

The fact that she read them and yelled at you while you were still under the influence of anesthesia makes the situation even worse.

What she did to you was wrong. You’re an adult and you don’t have to answer for any ‘disappointments’ or ‘shocks’ she may claim you cause her. She did her job of raising you and now she needs to let you live your life"
