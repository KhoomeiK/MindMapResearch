So yeah I wouldn’t be attracted by a woman with a nice ass but ugly face, but I realised that the criteria that usually makes the difference is the ass, because women with an ass nicely shaped (not flat but not fat either, somewhere in the middle, with a somewhat rounded shape), are not very common. As for tits, I’m not really picky."

But the us are not really a developed country though, it’s more like a wealthy under developed country. If you want to look up to a developed country, you’d have to turn to wealthy countries with old civilisations, like in Western Europe or East Asia. They’re countries that don’t desperately try to find their identity but having no idea what they’re doing, like colonised countries. You could probably add Canada and New Zealand though, they seem to be a bit wiser."

space,fcfcpf0,t1_fca185t,1577628676.0,"In my opinion, even if advanced civilisations were quite common I think it’s probably difficult to detect it. Like, a civilisation that would be more than a few thousands light years away from us couldn’t tell there’s an advanced civilisation on earth, even by direct observation. And we started using radio waves just a few decades ago, so it could take a few centuries or thousands years before a potential civilisation could detect our radio waves with their equivalent of SETI experiments. 

As for space travel, in our current state of technology it’s slow.  It’s not unlikely that even more advanced civilisations can’t travel much faster. Maybe there’s a kind of glass ceiling for space travel speed, or maybe they only recently developed decent space travel technologies. 

Who knows, my point is that, in my opinion, we tend to overestimate the ability for any civilisation to detect another civilisation, because the galaxy is big. And that’s just our galaxy, there may be thousands of civilisations spread across all the galaxies, and we’ll never learn about them."
