GodofWar,fgq89wn,t1_fgombr2,1581019716.0,"I should have been more clear. I wrote this while playing the game and was eager to go back playing. I got to the top of the mountain (one with the tree dude) for the first time, and was just enjoying the view. I noticed the lake far away and placed it in the center of my screen (so naturally, Kratos is facing the lake). Then I went to the map menu and noticed that the map is  indicating that Kratos is facing east when the lake is actually located in the west of the mountain. I was just nitpicking that the view from the top of the mountain does not match with the map."

PublicFreakout,fg1agbb,t3_ew6gf6,1580423685.0,"Stupid Millennials, when America was great, we used to beat the crap out of nerd like him so his kinds would know their place. It’s sad how soft Americans have become! This is what happens when wimin don’t stay in kitchen and men care more about equal rights than real American football! Hurr hurr hurr."

Paarl is the difficult “easy” boss for me. I can’t freaking see his attacks because of all the lightning effects. We just end up beating the crap out of each other until one of us dies and I end up feeling quite unsatisfied when I am the one left standing."
funny,ffrzgk9,t3_eusrbn,1580169448.0,I'd swear that it was Darjeeling.
baseball,ffrkuk7,t3_eut0hn,1580160103.0,Why would these cheaters even think that they did something wrong and should apologize when they were rewarded for it without consequences? I bet many of them thinks that the league should be grateful to them for bringing more profits.
startrek,ffpxw03,t3_euiuqq,1580110195.0,I think it’s a watchable episode. But it is terrible and straight up disrespectful to the Enterprise team as the show’s finale.
Mariners,ffpwya7,t3_euj0kk,1580109007.0,And nothing substantial will ever be done because profit outweighs everything else in our society. These cheaters will continue to be rewarded with slap on their wrists unless cheating becomes unprofitable to the league.

But he was professional enough to pitch like that while being unhappy, I can’t really complain. It’s just too bad that Justin Smoak trade didn’t work out."

baseball,felikcs,t3_epr5ph,1579223024.0,"Our society itself rewards greed over everything else.  It is designed for people in power to “cheat” and step over others with less power then change the rule to receive no punishment or lessen it. There are plenty of corporations and people that have broken many violations because the fine is a chump change compared to the benefit of breaking the “rules.” Unless the punishment is severe enough to damage their bank accounts, these “cheaters” will continue to prosper more than any hard working people in our country."

videos,fe072oe,t3_engae5,1578804760.0,"Well, if they pull themselves up by their bootstraps, they would have real jobs with more money. Low paying jobs such as teaching and flipping burgers are obviously for uneducated and part time students anyway. Hurr hurr hurr. /s"
