osr,ffdwprd,t1_ff6gan1,1579830813.0,Do you post related stuff on Instagram?
corgi,ffdw07s,t3_esy8cq,1579830310.0,Any tips on bathing dogs? Mine seems to think I'm punishing her. I run the water before she gets in so the water pipe sound doesn't spook her. Not sure what else I can do.
DungeonWorld,ffdpu1e,t3_eqiwnm,1579826087.0,Which channel in the DW Discord was this made in? I'd love to contribute to one of these.
volcas,ffdjwv1,t3_eszdhb,1579822447.0,"Are you set on sticking with a Volca? If not I'd say look into Arturia's Microbrute if you want to stay analog, or their Microfreak if you're down with digital."
ErgoMechKeyboards,ffcore5,t1_ffcnm0b,1579803992.0,"The Kyria is close but doesn’t do the backlit thing, just underglow. Trying to decide between that and this though."
ErgoMechKeyboards,ffcm22s,t3_esmd2x,1579802329.0,I love this. I wonder if it'd be easy to get RGB for the keys and a rotary encoder for one of the inner column keys.
rpg,ffbke4v,t3_esmcz2,1579769495.0,PDFs that are easily readable on a phone.
rpg,ffbkbiw,t1_ffbe9em,1579769394.0,The fail forward thing is one of my favorite takeaways from PBtA. I love having trinary outcomes rather than binary. One could argue that Han Solo never rolled above a 9 except when piloting when viewed through the lens of that system.
justneckbeardthings,ffbgm08,t1_ffbeqki,1579764396.0,Agree to disagree then. An unstructured felt hat with a rounded top is perfectly fine and not utilitarian at all. It’s not like it looks like a neckbeard trilby or an Indiana Jones fedora.
justneckbeardthings,ffbempd,t1_ffbckaa,1579761993.0,Yeah but then I have to buy a jacket with a hood. A hat can go with anything.
rpg,ffb8wm6,t1_ffb8rsb,1579755484.0,"Is meta-currency stuff like action points, FATE points or the like?"
osr,ffb79mh,t1_ff7srls,1579753724.0,"Are you the Zach Wolf that wrote at sentientgames.wordpress.com? If you are, I loved your Star Wars and Shadowrun hacks."
osr,ffb6qr2,t3_erw1rg,1579753290.0,"I love tables like in Maze Rats. Those are d66 tables which have 36 possibilities, 6 groups of 6. You roll 2d6 and one die is the group and one die is the row in that group. And they can be about anything. Monsters, spells, personality traits, facial details, a city's name, etc. It'd be a lot more effort per table, but I'd love to see d88 tables, where you roll 2d8 instead of 2d6.

I'd love more settings that aren't interchangeable with either Lord of the Rings or Forgotten Realms. Vornheim, Yoon-Suin, Veins of the Earth, Deep Carbon Observatory (though that's more of a quest module, but the world is unique feeling).

I really liked the Trilemma Adventures book of short adventures, but agreed with the review that some of them aren't very good: https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2020/01/osr-trilemma-adventures-vol-1-review_2.html . The reviewer's main complaint is some are unclear how to use right away, what the situation is, and why the players would want to go there.

My favorite parts of any Trilemma adventure, good or bad, is when they have a map with a cross section plus tables for random encounters, hooks, and treasure."
corgi,ffb5vxt,t3_eser9v,1579752625.0,My little lady met her full sister from another litter and they got on immediately. Mine usually needs to warm up to other dogs but they instantly liked each other and started taking turns chasing in the yard.
obscureguitars,ffb5i5y,t1_ff92dbz,1579752333.0,My copy of a Fender Musicmaster only has a neck pickup just like the original. I had it overwound so it was brighter. Still fairly bassy.
obscureguitars,ffb5g02,t3_es8hos,1579752288.0,What a beauty. I love minimalism of it.
justneckbeardthings,ffaxslc,t1_ffaqr2k,1579746970.0,You drop that sass until you invent a better way keep the rain or snow out of your collar.
justneckbeardthings,ffaxlu4,t1_ffao1eb,1579746848.0,"I'm pretty sure they are fedoras, but on the /r/malefasionadvice sub they often throw out a lot of rules once the weather gets inclement. Bald guys gotta wear something, and I never liked baseball hats because they don't do anything for the ears or neck."
justneckbeardthings,ffax9qx,t1_ffarfu6,1579746622.0,It's not a dress hat. It's more of an outdoors sort of thing. And it does the job in the winter. It comes off when I'm indoors.
justneckbeardthings,ffalzga,t1_ffa1szs,1579739073.0,I wear straw hats in the summer- https://www.goorin.com/collections/mens-straws/products/blueberry-haze-wide-brim-raffia-straw-fedora?variant=13346309308468
justneckbeardthings,ffalrgy,t1_ffah49i,1579738919.0,I wear felt fedoras that don't look like Humphrey Bogart wannabe type of hats: https://www.brixton.com/en_us/men/headwear/full-brim-fedoras/tiller-iii-hat-olive.html
DungeonWorld,ff9eg5i,t1_ff90c30,1579711246.0,I think if one hacks DW to be 4 stats then stat boosts would have to be every other level.
ErgoMechKeyboards,ff43x4q,t1_ff3ptay,1579554994.0,As a programmer I’m not even concerned with typing speed. I care far more about how little I move my hands and fingers.

guitarpedals,ff1nnic,t3_eqz6j8,1579482190.0,I have no help about the pedalboard but can you do a write up about the tube zipper and head rush?
LancerRPG,fez3i0i,t3_eqvq7z,1579453546.0,There’s a delay because they’re integrating the errata that’s been discovered into the print copy before they send it off to the actual printer.
PublicFreakout,fez185s,t1_feyzwpd,1579452964.0,I live in California and visit with family in Alabama. I’ve seen absolute waste of space towns in both. California has more because it’s much bigger.
ergodox,fewovuu,t3_eqre1d,1579417256.0,The thumbnail got me excited that someone had developed a mechanical keyboard hoodie.
rpg,fes9tzd,t1_ferg3d7,1579363019.0,"I agree. I go to the occasional meetup through the San Diego Roleplaying Association and they have a variety of games: 5E for adventurer’s league, a monthly story game bonanza (just learned how to okay FATE), Genesys, Cypher/Numenera, a homebrew system, Urban Shadows, etc. There’s always enough to run a game and often time the organizer has to call in a backup GM to take care of overflow if more than 6 people show up."
ErgoMechKeyboards,feosjwq,t3_eo4kyu,1579304804.0,"I wish the innermost thumb key could be 1u and the top half an encoder, rather than putting it all the way out along the thumb arc."
Games,feletjq,t3_epnsty,1579220498.0,I hope we’ll be able to tweak the field of view. I didn’t mind playing it on a console but the FOV was far too restrictive when inside of the ancient ruins.
SummertimeSaga,fel220w,t1_fekz6yp,1579212365.0,Doesn't the nun also have a strap on?
