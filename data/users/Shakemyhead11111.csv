for real though I think it's cool when dudes say 'yo,' I don't think it's harrassing I think it's just friendly and it means 'oh they're also out for a leisurely run today'"

running,fes08y0,t1_ferv9lr,1579360153.0,"Well.... (as one of those people who loves to greet everyone) friendly extroverted female, yes. In sales, yes. Career-oriented, yes. Have kids, no (but do want them)

I also have a SUPER super deep voice. It makes me come off as definitely non-soccer-mom-y (on top of not having children?) 

I do see what you're saying on 'non-equal tacit rules for women and men' but think soccer mom isn't the least dismissive term. Soccer moms are also data scientists at Google, yo -- they just have kids who play soccer"
running,feryuh6,t1_fern6w8,1579359760.0,"Yeah agree with this but for me when I don't acknowledge you back, I feel like from the pain in my face and body and just general stride (you KNOW when somebody's kicking their own ass vs just going easy that day) it's pretty obvious that like ""I can't do that right now,"" which is ok. Guess I'm saying it's not a ""I don't want to be friendly"" it's a ""I literally can't do that right now"""
running,ferxx0c,t3_eqg0m7,1579359440.0,"Midwesterner here, I usually do an eye contact and a small friendly 'ey' with an acknowledging pleasant facial expression and a slight upward nod with maybe a small wrist incline for a tiny wave. For baseline I do make eye contact and acknowledge strangers on the street (this is a very midwest thing) but live in Oakland/San Francisco and I think people still appreciate it!

Fun fact my run this year that felt the most interactive was in GERMANY (not known for excessive emotion), but on Christmas Eve around 3pm. It was definitely like ""oh you too? Hey!""

Scrolling down I see I think I just described the ""little secret runner's wave"" that u/ktigger2 said"

I wish women would talk more about miscarriages bc they‚Äôre so freaking common (I had no idea before starting this process) and being able to talk about it really helps.

I hope you‚Äôre feeling better ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Also yeah just getting married does NOT translate into having a cool $200k to casually put down on a mediocre boomer starter home in a far reach of Oakland.

Edit typo"

I may be naive here (I got married last year and am not up to date on this), but is there not some official domestic partnership status one can get to qualify for the same benefits (out of fairness that yeah it‚Äôs stupid that we‚Äôre economically incentivizing marriage, also back in the day if you were same sex couple you were basically screwed)?"

Question from a fellow lady trying to get this thing. What did your motivational self talk look like? Like we live in a world of skinny ass people and sometimes it seems so effortless to them - they just don‚Äôt want to seem to eat like I do. What did you think to overcome thoughts of hopelessness like that."
