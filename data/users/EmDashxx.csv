Basically when you're sitting on the toilet, your arms are resting on the sink. Definitely makes this stall seem like a mansion!"
nutrition,fftyqrj,t1_fftkerv,1580230654.0,"Quit telling people fruit is unhealthy. It's loaded with vitamins and minerals people *need*. Fruit is healthier than a lot of shit, including fast food burgers or a fuckton of cheese on your ""healthy"" pizza. Fruit is not fucking evil and sharing that stupid narrative keeps people away from foods that are actually really good for your body -- calories, including sugar, without nutrients is the problem."

nutrition,ffqabdj,t1_ffq35k4,1580128030.0,It really applies to anything your body can’t digest. That’s why “fake” sugars have 0 calories. Your body can’t absorb it.
nutrition,fflx6me,t1_ffky7ic,1580045268.0,"While that’s true, they also take a lot of energy go digest and are not fully digestible at the same time, so the true calorie count isn’t the same as what’s on the package. They’re satisfying and healthy."

You can wear a basic tee, turtleneck, long-sleeve shirt under a nice open-front sweater to make it pop. You can pair a t-neck or mock neck with a suit jacket or sweater. I really struggle with the shoes. I hate heels, but I found a pair of wedge shoes that I actually really like. It'll probably take you a while to find  your thing, but try to stick to some basics at the beginning. You'd be surprised at how easy it is to style them!

I used to hang out with more males, but now that I'm in a relationship, that's not really all that appropriate. And I don't go out drinking anymore. I don't like to go out to eat very often because I just don't feel good when eating all sorts of bad shit. So I am mostly just alone all the time. I've started volunteering and stuff, and teaching a class at the gym, and that definitely helps. But I still wish I had some really close lady friends to hang out with.

1. Can people be allergic to food and only get a symptom like a stomach ache/nausea?
2. As someone who suffers from debilitating environmental allergies -- do any of these food allergy treatments translate to other allergic reactions as well?

Someone here mentioned eat fruit instead: Definitely a positive change! It does satisfy that sweet craving, but it also doesn't make you feel bad about yourself. And total denial is often the worst thing you can do. Make a cheat day once every other weekend or something where yes, you do have a cookie or a soda, or whatever it is you crave. If you have trouble keeping it to just one (I know I do), don't set yourself up for failure. Buy ONE and bring it home, with nothing else in the house, so you can't accidentally binge. And be good to yourself. Don't layer on the guilt. The psychological things can make you want to give up and binge anyway. A little bit here and there is not bad."
