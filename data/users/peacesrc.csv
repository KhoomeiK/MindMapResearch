SkincareAddiction,ffcjmrc,t3_esmwrx,1579800867.0,This is what we were always told in esthetics. Sometimes we have to turn people away for facials because we’re only allowed to work with the first two grades of acne. Medication and a medical professional should always be the first option and then you work with an esthetician and build your shelf. It’ll narrows down the hell out of the products you’re using when you know what ingredients you truly need.

Oof or fucking grape dimetapp."

IllegalLifeProTips,ff8fbnq,t3_erro7m,1579676021.0,"I feel so disgusting saying this, but when I was going to a methadone clinic every day, I wasn’t staying clean by any means. For those of you who aren’t familiar; at almost every clinic, you only get a single dose for the day and keep coming back until you pass regular and surprise drug tests to accrue more take home doses. Sometimes I’d have to wait an hour at 5am to get my dose and standing in line and driving quite a ways to get there was not convenient by any stretch. 

The rare times I was clean, I would pee into a tiny specimen cup and freeze it and warm it up every morning in the microwave for 10 seconds and wrap a hand warmer (hot hands brand) around it, or pour it into an insulated coffee tumbler and wait to see if I’d get tested. It worked like a charm every.single.time. I’m a female btw and was able to whip it out of my purse or crotch it. I scammed my way up to 2 weeks worth of take home doses. This is all making allowances for being lucky enough to not have observed tests btw. 

Otherwise I would’ve just taped it to my thigh as it’s warm there and they never looked directly at me during the test in my experience. If you find yourself in a position where the person testing you will be looking at you, get a visine bottle or something similar, cut the top off, pour the clean pee in, glue the top back on and squeeze into the cup from it taped to your thigh. It’ll just look like you’re naturally perched over the cup steadying yourself. 

Side note: I’m clean now two years and I’m so glad I never have to do that again. -shiver-"

AskReddit,ff4r7pf,t3_erhu3x,1579570495.0,"It’s a recurring dream I’ve had for over a year now. It’s always me in this MASSIVE like...Rothschild style mansion. I’m in the walk in closet that leads to another room covered in marble and fancy patterned green carpet. I’m scared to go in there. It feels haunted. I then wake up. Even when I fall back to sleep, I never dare to step more than one foot out of the closet before I wake up. I never find out why I’m so afraid. 

That dream, or I’m always breathing extremely heavily like I’m having a panic attack towards a sinister presence/person and I try to stand up to them and scream things like “STOP” or “NO,” but all I can ever muster is a faint whisper with all my might. If you’ve seen The Haunting of Hill House where Luke wakes up in rehab to Nellie appearing to him and she breathes heavily and faintly says “ GO!” ....that’s Exactly what it’s like for me. I’m constantly finding myself floating/levitating off the ground to get away from this person/thing and once I rise off the ground, I get higher in a painfully slow motion and yet something always catches my foot and then I wake up. It continues onward when I fall back asleep and I can never get to the bottom of it. 

I don’t know why this is happening or why I can’t shake the dreams, but sometimes I’m afraid to sleep because of it. It feels too real and I feel too helpless."
