This guy sums up the issue really well imo. After years of people slamming the prequels since their debut for their cg use, this narrative of ""everything is cgi"" permeated and became a default measurement bar. Then you watch the films and notice little things that look off or are standing out. ""They must be bad cgi as well"" you think, just reinforcing the idea

Some years later all of this behind the scenes stuff becomes prevalent on the internet, and really shows how much of what people were sure so was cgi, is practical effects. 

I think the prequels were amazing for world building and the story they were telling, but too much cgi use from what is really cgi's infancy, and mountains of awkward dialogue have really put a stain on them that feels like only within the past couple of years has finally started to wash away."

Ignoring how haphazardly they attempt to arrest him, once the action starts there's way too many cuts. The shots themselves are intentionally off centered, I guess to imply how quick Sidious is, but it just doesn't work. It looks and feels sluggish and sloppy in comparison to the other lightsaber fights in the prequels, yet just as it begins it's already over. The jedi, all except for Windu, are already dead

Also the Jedi themselves, except for Windu, barely manage to pull their lightsabers out of their pockets even though they knew what they were walking into, and then they each flail it around once before just dieing. They make it look like they've never even used them before.

A lot of these guys grew up listening to stories about ww2 from their parents, so some were quick to volunteer to go over to ""Nam"", ""do their duty"", etc. But vietnam wasn't like previous wars. Most wars revolve around taking territory, fighting conventional battles against a professional army, but in Vietnam we would spend all week fighting to kill some guerrilla fighters on a hill top, capture it, and then abandon it only to come back a week later and do it all over again. It was very unconventional, and then these guys finish their tours, they're dismayed at the tactics being used or seeing their friends die, and they come back to the US and form groups like Vietnam Veterans Against the War. They start anti war protests. The point of those being to raise awareness, and rally people to their side. 

So what's the deal with the photo? It's a group of some of the first US veterans to ever come back from a war and really rebel against it. I would strongly argue there's a shock factor to it as well. These are people who left looking to protect the land of the free, they'd heard all of those glory stories of ww2, and then they came back and are now throwing their medals they received back to the government in DC. They gave a giant middle finger to the government, and how it was treating it's soldiers. If even the troops aren't in favor of the war how could anyone else possibly support it? And that's the message that was shown to everyone when they opened up their newspapers to see things like this, or when they watched the evening news, or saw things like this in person. That message permeated throughout the entire country resulting in a strong anti Vietnam War opinion both in civilians and it's armed forces who were now drafting people to go."
