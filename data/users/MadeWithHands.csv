I'm very familiar with the corporate liabilities from nuclear construction, from when they used to cover everything with asbestos. They don't use as much asbestos anymore, but it's still the same companies who build and maintain reactors.

Honestly, when you say you want to build nuclear plants, you're saying you want to hand a bunch of tax dollars to defense contractors. They don't need to be rewarded and they definitely don't need any more of our tax money.

It would be one thing if there weren't alternatives to nuclear power, but there are. And those companies actually need capital investment so they can keep up with future demand instead of lining the pockets of shareholders."

Your argument is this: I believe in drivers' rights to choose a lane.

The anti-vaxer argument sounds like this: If I stop at this stop sign, I might get rear ended. I'm not willing to take that risk, so I'm not stopping.

I don't see anything here that helps or identifies a workers' comp. claim.

Workers' comp. claims are challenged on medical records where there is a dispute as to the cause of the diagnosis (must be work related), the nature of disability (temporary or permanent), or the extent of disability (partial or total).

I assume the challenge here is on causation. You must get a doctor to say that your diagnosis is more likely than not caused by your work activities or a specific work event. 

You should consult with a lawyer because in some places that language will not be enough. This is especially important if there is any sort of pre existing condition. For example, if you are claiming a chest pain injury and have a history of high blood pressure, some places only require you to show the work activities/event is a major cause, some place require you to show the work activities/event to be the major cause.
