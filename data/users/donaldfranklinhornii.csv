The Duchy of Sussex is not under any threat, at the moment, but who knows what machinations the Earl of Wessex could be cooking up knowing there is an empty Duchy available.

What is there to stop the Dukes of Essex or Buckinghamshire from making incursions into Sussex? This was very ill handled on the 1st Earl of Dumbarton's part. The effects may very well be felt by the 4th or 5th Baron Kileel.
