The final amendment was added to clarify that if you enter the intersection with your front tires while the light is yellow or green you're fine. In fact, technically, according to state law (Tennessee Code 55-8-129) once a driver has begun their turn, all other traffic must yield to you, you still have to begin the turn when you safely have room to do so, but once you're going, you have the right of way.

You still can't enter an intersection if there isn't room to safely exit it (ie the road you're turning onto is backed up to the box) but you can definitely legally enter an intersection on a green light with the intention  of turning left"

It is absolutely easier in any medium to heavy vehicle to use the mechanical advantage you get from your ebrake than to think you can push an unassisted pedal hard enough to bring you to a stop, in some light vehicles it may or may not be depending.

nashville,fek2744,t1_fek13gl,1579191029.0,"So i get what you're saying, but I firmly disagree and here's why: driving is a habit. If you get into the habit of cutting corners, not using turn signals, not checking your blind spot, not stopping for stop signs, etc., When you don't need to do it, then you will not do it when you need to. It becomes a habit to drive one way and when in doubt that's what drivers will almost always revert to.

I think it's insane that they only require turn signals here when it ""effects another driver""... It simply gets everyone into the bad habit of not using them and means that even if they do use them correctly when they see other drivers, that when they don't see another driver, even if their turn will effect them, they won't use it.

Take this turn for example though, clearly the driver thought nobody was around, so he's shortcutting the corner exactly as you imply wouldn't be problematic... But the issue is he's unaware that there is someone around. If he had just been driving correctly instead of driving differently because he thought no one was around then the entire situation would have never happened.

Not entirely related to your suggestion, but Another reason this type of turn is so unacceptable is that your front driver's-side pylon directly lines up with anyone who may be in the spot that op is occupying in that lane, I've been struck and almost hit several times myself by drivers who couldn't see me legally crossing the street because that pylon was in the way. Had they pulled up perpendicular instead of cutting the corner, anyone in that spot would have been visible through their driver's side window instead.

It's likely the bird was winged or injured in some other way where it can't get away, or it may be dazed after a fall, etc., His behavior though, is clearly focused on killing the other birds, not on being astonished or anything like that that, this duck is not his focus. I guarantee you if a duck came up to a hunter and let him start petting it, that would be his focus.

Even if, in some crazy scenario it did wander up to him, he's still out there to KILL all the rest of them, that's what he's actively trying to do here, which is why he's fumbling so hard to pull out his call. It looks like there are other birds in the air, he's dropped to the ground in a strange position (usually you'd be in a blind) and he's trying to get his call out before they can get away.

He may also be trying to pull his call out for a different reason, as it's quite common for hunters to clip their ""finishers"" on their call. A finisher is a small device designed to be driven into their neck to sever their spinal cord when they've been downed but not killed.

The most likely scenario is that this duck is injured by him shortly before this clip was taken, it started waking up/moving and he's trying to keep it pacified so he or his buddy) can get a shot on another. 

There's also a remote chance it's a pet duck he's using as a call duck, which would be even worse as this would be an example of training an animal to assist in killing its own kind, but I heavily doubt this by the way he's keeping it held to his side, for a call duck he'd likely have a better solution to keeping it contained than just holding it next to him, or he would want it to be visible.

Either way, this has no place here as any kind of ""good"" thing. He is not out there to pet ducks."
vegan,fdqgn01,t3_emo2xo,1578666180.0,"This looks like a wounded bird he injured, and he's holding it instead of finishing it off so it won't spook the other birds that are nearby. Looks like he's trying to get his call out so he can try to kill some of them and THEN he'll finish off this one.

This is disgusting."
Eyebleach,fdqcor4,t1_fdpil0p,1578663112.0,"You know what enrages me? People who kill any animal just for fun or because they like the taste.

You're not much better than he is, you just have some arbitrary rule you've decided makes what you do moral just like when everyone else walks into a grocery store and pays for animals to die. It doesn't. You're killing them unnecessarily for fun. You make them suffer."
Eyebleach,fdqb5ir,t1_fdq0e24,1578661779.0,Clearly he understands how wild animals actually work and how a hunter comes to be within reach of one.

Whatever the girls do in a no bag school they can do in a clear bag school; right?"
