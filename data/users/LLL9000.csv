vanderpumprules,fg1n9sh,t1_fg1m320,1580430188.0,"He definitely convinced her to do it. I think it’s gross when girls let guys dictate, influence, or encourage them with what to do with their bodies. 90s stripper tits are not cute on young girls. It ages them and they make Brittany look a lot heavier than she is, especially with her short boxy torso. She needs a reduction for sure."
belowdeck,fg1ag9i,t1_fg19jj2,1580423684.0,They filmed a couple days ago I think. Probably doing editing now.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fg18adw,t1_fg135xn,1580422626.0,Meh. She’s used to hearing her voice on tv and social. I think she just liked the filter.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fg17vex,t3_ewb9gj,1580422434.0,"Ok. I’m officially sick of this little cocksucker talking about her vagina.

I really wish this trashy little derelict fuck boy would go on about his way. But I bet he’s loving all the attention. We should all just troll him straight back into oblivion where he belongs."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fg0vf3q,t3_ew7odl,1580415789.0,Always forget and end up late somewhere.
blunderyears,fg0t9qj,t1_fg0s65r,1580414580.0,"I thought you would give up but it seems that after a little hiatus of thinking about it you decided to go full troll. You are clearly just a miserable little boy who enjoys bringing others down because you are unhappy. Probably bullied in highschool for your looks too so this thread is super triggering for you. I get it. Maybe seek therapy though instead of trolling on Reddit. 

You can have the last word. I don’t mind and it doesn’t bother me a bit. I’m a happy and generous person like that."
blunderyears,fg0r71n,t1_fg0r3e0,1580413422.0,I’ll just block you.
PublicFreakout,fg0qvrx,t3_evpiff,1580413249.0,I’m so confused as to who is fighting who here.
PublicFreakout,fg0qgur,t1_fg0fsb2,1580413021.0,I know there was one in ATL in the early 2000s. Not sure where this is tho.
blunderyears,fg0q9fc,t1_fg0pzzr,1580412908.0,No one wants to participate with you.

blunderyears,fg0oxtz,t1_fg0ot3s,1580412174.0,No one wants to argue with trolls on a fun sub. Go away.
aww,fg0o0vl,t1_fg0ntpu,1580411663.0,"She’s beautiful. I love those big brown eyes!!If I recall correctly, the shedding gets worse as they age. It’s been like 8 years since my Goldie died but all of my other dogs would shed worse as they aged. I still love the Goldie/Newfie mixes tho. One of my fave hybrids."
aww,fg0nq7i,t1_fg0noo1,1580411495.0,How old is she?
aww,fg0nkz2,t1_fg0niyl,1580411410.0,I want! I bet the shedding is going to be out of control tho.

vanderpumprules,fg0nact,t3_ew788n,1580411238.0,"Jax is such a liar and a chameleon for attention. He tells people what they want to hear and becomes who he thinks they want him to be. And this is how I 100% believe he was gay for pay in Miami. 

We will never know the real Jax."
MovieSuggestions,fg0lahj,t3_ew5xcf,1580410082.0,I saw Dazed and Confused on VHS when I was 14 in the summer of 95. I remember exactly where I was when I saw it and I don’t recall much from my childhood. Not many movies compare to the way that movie made me feel in my pre teens. It was equal parts nostalgia for a time I wasn’t even alive and excitement for things to come. That was a fun summer
blunderyears,fg0karz,t1_fg0jvax,1580409515.0,"Stop trolling and go away.

97 is mid 90s. I was 16 in 97 and it was every bit of mid 90s as far as attire and genre were concerned. Not to mention actual year."
blunderyears,fg0j89m,t1_fg0itla,1580408899.0,I never said 6 Chica. 97 was still mid 90s in my mind. And if you read you will see she confirmed the years.
vanderpumprules,fg0if0p,t3_ew8f6e,1580408435.0,She would look so much better if her boobs were smaller. She looks tiny in that t shirt cause her boobs are hanging down.
blunderyears,fg0h1lu,t1_fg06ql3,1580407638.0,Don’t bruh me. I’m a not a dude. And yes it looks like it could be an 8 to 10 year old with some severe hormonal problems.
vanderpumprules,fg0f3wh,t3_ew2ilj,1580406476.0,She was coked up and paranoid.
AskReddit,ffzel1g,t3_evrp8v,1580375119.0,I would ask him a question. Why me?
youseeingthisshit,ffze0yl,t3_ew0coi,1580374335.0,"Go ahead and google Jonathan Crenshaw. His mugshots are hilarious and he apparently does have appendages with a couple of working fingers it seems. Also, did he say give it to a cracked addict?"
blunderyears,ffzapnu,t1_ffzakum,1580369894.0,My god. She somehow looks older in this one yet says she’s younger.

vanderpumprules,ffz9nxr,t1_ffylpd3,1580368596.0,Are we going to see more of James? He’s so hilariously goofy and awful. We miss him.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffz3hjh,t3_evitiz,1580362726.0,She’s such a little trash monster. I can’t stand her.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffz21gj,t1_ffz0zlu,1580361420.0,Have you seen the second video where she asks about Muslims getting 72 virgins? If you haven’t it’s on my profile. I’ve watched it 10 times. It’s hilarious.
beauty,ffz0ktv,t3_evtuoa,1580360141.0,Currently? Banana powder.

pics,ffz08p5,t3_evsnir,1580359857.0,You can’t order them online or something? Like they don’t sell on the deep web somewhere? Hell I’ll ship you some. $10 a pack.
blunderyears,ffyvrwr,t1_ffyvjlo,1580356377.0,70s and 80s bowl cuts were especially popular on females.

blunderyears,ffypefq,t1_ffymn7x,1580351915.0,I thought so too! Meaning this was in like 01. Oof.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffy1hb8,t3_evr291,1580336693.0,Herb is trash.
blunderyears,ffxxkl6,t1_ffxxhrm,1580334392.0,"I know. That’s why it’s such a blunder. 


And I get it. I would have done my best to block out those years too if I were you."
blunderyears,ffxxf3k,t1_ffxx5cg,1580334306.0,Wow. I cannot get over the bowl cut and this cardigan with bunnies for buttons. It screams early 80s. This is the best blunder I’ve seen here. Congrats!
blunderyears,ffxx0z0,t1_ffxwp8c,1580334091.0,"Oh you sweet summer child. I promise I’m not being mean but is your mom elderly or did your grandmother dress/raise you? Genuinely curious.

Edit: I just realized you look like Stephen Baldwin here."
blunderyears,ffxwngz,t1_ffxv5n8,1580333885.0,So this photo was taken in the mid to late 90s?

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffvxgj7,t3_evi2oe,1580276273.0,She’s totally cracked out on something.
sociopath,ffvut3a,t1_ffvbmuo,1580273888.0,Because even though sociopaths lack empathy for anyone else their arrogance leads them to believe that everyone should still be empathetic towards them.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffvelkc,t1_ffup7xk,1580262300.0,That Fanny pack doesn’t look real. She also appears to be wearing yeezys which are an ignorant purchase as well.
interestingasfuck,ffuhf43,t3_ev7lew,1580242010.0,He looks older than that imo.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffugq2y,t1_ffuda6y,1580241593.0,"She’s got a funny way of showing it if she has any regrets. Instead of making amends to her oldest, who no doubt endured the most trauma, she’s talking shit and calling her names on social media to millions of people. That is her child and it’s inexcusable. Steph is scum."
Floribama,ffudd42,t3_ev8we0,1580239592.0,He looks fucking crazed here. I’m convinced his brother has gotten him on some shit.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffud8cb,t1_ffu4sk7,1580239512.0,That’s because their lives have been so hectic that it’s hard to paint a picture.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffud0qe,t1_ffubck2,1580239389.0,Definitely. It doesn’t matter what Mallorie does when it comes to her and Steph. Steph was the parent who chose drugs over her child and now the cycle is continuing. Seeing her own failures play out through her grandchild is making her lash out at Mal. She is talking shit on social media about her own child. That’s inexcusable. It’s a fucking mess and it’s sad.
movies,ffu5pv9,t3_ev021b,1580235051.0,This is actually common. I’ve heard of pregnant ladies having cravings for dirt and other strange things.
videos,ffu2ly6,t1_fftnk9k,1580233152.0,"One of Kobe’s old pilots actually said, and I’m paraphrasing here, that the possibility of both engines failing on that type of helicopter is almost impossible so it must have been the conditions that caused the accident."
ContagiousLaughter,fftnr7k,t1_fftn952,1580225165.0,Eh.
AnimalsBeingBros,fftnkr9,t1_fftkywg,1580225043.0,Yes. It’s a living being. I wouldn’t want a human or a dog to die saving me.
Wellthatsucks,fftneew,t3_euyf9o,1580224926.0,I don’t understand these tests. They tell a person they are allergic to stuff yet that person is already exposed to those allergens and never had a problem. My fiancé is apparently allergic to dogs and cats yet we have dogs and a cat. The cat sleeps with him. I don’t get it.
