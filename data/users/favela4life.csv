Unkempt Harold will probably be your best bet since it’s just brokenly good (especially with the Bee).

You can get the Bee + Fibber build (I call it the Beeber...idk if it’s a thing or not) but that requires hanging behind cover.

You can also use a powerful Jakobs shotgun at point blank. That’s assuming you go for Anarchy. Imo Gaige is trash without Anarchy. She has a skill that instantly refills 20-100% of your shield with every kill, so that would work well with a turtle shield. This point blank strategy would also require that you always kill someone, and occasionally, switch to the Grog.

INJUSTICE,fd9gwfy,t3_ek87oo,1578233137.0,He’s sluggish but deals a crap ton of damage. Watch some tournament footage with Bane and you can get a better feel of how he’s meant to be played.
Borderlands2,fd9brer,t3_ekbj1d,1578231163.0,"People use Caustic Caverns so they can bring the Varkids towards the other creatures and you can basically just sit back and watch them fight one another as the varkids level up. A popular source of varkids is in Wam Bam Island in the first mission (requires you to not have completed the dlc yet). If you ask me, I’d stick to Caustic Caverns."

As to the launcher itself, it’s the highest damaging in the game. Great for second winds."

Borderlands2,fd5doej,t3_ejzv17,1578176623.0,"If you’re getting hit by bullets, or using Norfleet/launchers, use Sham. If you wanna hang back and shoot enemies from a distance or behind cover, Bee is nice. Otherwise choose different shields."
INJUSTICE,fd5clik,t3_ejngfm,1578176287.0,"Red Hood is hard to get a grip of imo. I had trouble connecting Joker moves.

Superman is very beginner-friendly as he hits hard and doesn’t need many attacks to deal damage, but he is sluggish. Atrocitus is sluggish but if you play without tournament you can deal huge damage since his strings are long.

Blue Beetle and Supergirl are easy to play imo. Batman and Black Adam are op imo."
INJUSTICE,fd5bv0x,t1_fd0bgss,1578176049.0,I don’t zone with Firestorm. I still use his skills a lot so I’d say do 50/50.

college,fcxlhpb,t3_ejeuio,1578065817.0,"My senior year I had already made peace with the fact I’d end up going to a less-than-ideal school. I still applied to my dream school, and ended up getting in.

It only matters in high school to get clout. Once you’re in college, the only thing that matters is getting a job. That’s what everyone in every school is worried about."
college,fcxl3jy,t3_ejg1zv,1578065552.0,Be worried. I didn’t start worrying until my sophomore year and I think I was too late.

INJUSTICE,fcwf8qh,t3_eiyks4,1578024108.0,Play EVERY character until you like someone. Watch tournaments on YT so you get acquainted with their playstyles.
college,fcwf2kv,t3_ej463e,1578023985.0,"I'm on same boat. Just keep applying. Hype up everything on your resume. Get your resume reviewed. Become an efficient internship-applier (have a ready CV and Cover Letter where you can just change the name of the company/position). Have some stuff on your portfolio if applicable.

My GPA is *HORRIBLE*, and I still landed some interviews with big companies. Still waiting to hear from them though, and I have more interviews coming up. Never settle for anything in hopes they're gonna offer you something. Keep applying, be a pessimist after each application (by that I mean don't have expectations), yet be just enough of an optimist to keep applying.

If all else fails, I still met some workers, in the big companies I interviewed at, who never had an internship prior to working there. Consider alternative career options in case you need to work on something else for a few months after graduation, and if that happens, keep applying for jobs/internships.

Needless to say, people in our position should consider relocating ANYWHERE. The more excuses, the lower your chances.

Your GPA will matter *much* less after your first internship, and even less after each job afterwards. After getting your first job, no one will care about it anymore. (Or so I've been told)"

Check your school's library.

Check with other students to see if they won't lend you.

Everyone in my major has a shared Google Drive with all our textbooks, so I rarely buy anything.

If all else fails, rent from Amazon/Chegg/bookstore."

Some are actually quite academic and take school and grades seriously. But they're all social and get cray cray on weekends, just like the movies if not more graphic."

It seems you’re after a casual Greek life rather than a wild one. One of my friends joined the frat with the highest median GPA in his school. If you find a sorority like this, it would probably be worth it."
