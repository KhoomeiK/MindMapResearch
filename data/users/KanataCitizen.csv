CanadaPublicServants,ffchkmz,t1_ffbyjyc,1579799617.0,"*Deficit Reduction Action Plan* (DRA) was also known as the *Workforce Adjustment* (WFA). This occurred back in 2012 when the Conservatives were in power.  They did a large lay-off (approx 26,000) of the Public Service in an attempt to save money and look efficient to tax payers. 1/3 was in the NCR. This happened previously in 1990's with 44,000 job cuts to the public sector. A lot of the job cuts in larger departments were vast and happened suddenly. I believe most affected were lower-positions (mainly support functions) or those on the cusp of retirement, or they just eliminated vacant nonessential positions. It pushed a lot of senior employees out the door and a great loss of corporate knowledge.  I could be wrong, but I don't believe many in management (EX+) were affected.  Those classifications that remained, would be fought over. Many coworkers ended up turning on one another when re-competing for their jobs. To make matters worse, they also imposed a salary freeze that resulted in government-wide hiring freezes. Because of the salary freeze, departments had to absorb the wage increases without additional cuts to programs, services or staff. A lot of employees were also left in the dark on a lot of the reasoning and not much transparency was communicated during this time. People were patiently waiting for months to hear if they ""won the lottery"" to keep their jobs. In some instances, you had to write a strong rationale to justify keeping your job. 


DRAP really changed the culture of the public service (some for the better), but resulted in many people working additional hours--often unpaid--to the point of burnout. Many managers felt if they pushed hard enough and the work was getting done, they wouldn't need to restaff many positions. This increased the number of staff enduring mental, emotional and physical exhaustion or pain; many were and still are taking medical leave of absence from their jobs because they can't keep up. As mentioned in another comment, a lot of the vacant positions that were eliminated were downgraded at a lower-level and restaffed; yet the duties, deliverables and workload slightly unchanged; or if anything, increased.  Still to this day, not a lot of managers are allowed to grant their employees acting pay, so they find workarounds, or plain out just don't recognize the additional work through compensation. I've had some managers provide me and other coworkers a few hours off during the slow periods as compensations. I'd have to claim it in the system, but after the time was taken, they'd decline it. There's an unspoken common knowledge in the Public Service now, in order to obtain a pay increase, you have to move around a lot more.  Many stay in their position under a year.  There's rarely loyalty or recognition from the employer which affects the morale of the employees. 


When the Phoenix pay fiasco hit, people were stuck in a dilemma: stay and receive a pay cheque (hopefully), or take a risk and move to another position which would change your pay profile and likely affect your pay for months to come. Because loyal employees are constantly being bashed around with a confusing head games and lip-service ideologies, there's been a bitter tone to working in the PS.  It's great to see a lot more young people being on-boarded with optimism and fresh ideas, but you'll see given a few years or months in, they need to downgrade their skills and put up with nonsensical bureaucracy. We put up with it because we know after many years we can walk away with a decent pension: hence the term *""Golden Handcuffs""*.
