hajimenoippo,ff8fxcx,t3_es2c73,1579676734.0,"What kills me is that, at the same time: Ippo did what I feared the most he would do, which was to pass the ""keep going kid, now with spirit!"" Kamogawa approach and inadvertently turn Kimura into Ippo 2; but that it was also probably the right choice.  
Kimura had no chance in hell coming into this fight, it was downright medically unreasonable. By any reasonable standard Ippo performed at an incredible level as a coach and Kimura was able to perfectly follow his instructions, turning a sure lose into an incredibly close match. I still hope Kimura will win but the message seems confusing. ""Even if you don't win, stick to the Dempsey Roll, it's your best shot?"""

I just wanted to remind you that you're not choosing a King or an Emperor. So whoever you do choose, you have 4 years to MAKE them do what's right, to ask and petition and demonstrate and protest and demand for what you think it's the best for your country, regardless of who is office. If all you do is vote, it will always feel like choosing between a turd and douche. Voting is the bare minimum of participation in a democracy. Good luck."

MTGPuzzleQuest,ff1dp5p,t3_equh4z,1579477853.0,"Not really specific advice but: check the wiki, it has the decks of every non pvp opponent for all events. Then tailor your deck accordingly, for example: if your opponent has no support removal use a support that disables their creatures, that and a few creature removal spells will make you almost immune to creature damage. Look for persistent threats, cards that once cast will keep bringing  creatures or doing damage at no cost of either cards or mana, for example, Thopter Spy Network. If your opponent has no creature removal, a blocker with first strike or indestructible will take care of all creature damage. In general, you said it yourself: out speeding your opponent is not possible, so a slower, tailor made approach is in order. I would probably try with a blue or white pw as they have an easier time with those styles. Balanced decks will usually have 2 mana generators, 2 creature removal spells, 2-3 creatures, 1 support removal spell, 2 draw cards and some card to fulfill objectives, otherwise double down on whatever you need extra assurance."

todayilearned,fdf2o7k,t1_fdf06ep,1578351928.0,"A bit from both but mostly the second point. The first leads to a lot of speculation so I don't really feel comfortable discussing it, but the chemical part would be hard to emulate. On the second point, the architectural difference goes so far it's beyond programming language that there are no analogs, one would have to first, gain a much better understanding of not just the brain but the nervous system, sensory inputs, learning systems, classification and memory storage, heuristics, pattern recognition, processing hierarchy then forget most of what we know about how computers are designed and start developing proper emulations of those modules. In short, brains, by definition,  do not exist in a void and do not develop in a void, just creating both sensory inputs on par with human ones and the software interpret them in a human manner is a daunting enough task that has practically no bearing in processing power.  
The other issue is the moving goal posts of what a makes a ""human brain"". Everytime a computer achieves a broadly enough task that was used as an example of ""human brain"" power it is deemed not truly smart. Will a computer be equivalent to a human brain if it has no childhood? If it experiences no pain? If it never forgets, if it doesn't fear death, non existence? What makes a brain ""human""? What makes a human, human?"

AskReddit,fddb0ra,t1_fdcwfa0,1578303371.0,"Best advice is get a new teacher, honestly. There's no comparing getting on-the-spot feedback. A good teacher will stop you from developing bad habits. People who are self tought  develope bad habits while learning something new because they haven't yet learned something else. Also, going to a teacher sets time apart to just practice, it's like the difference with going to the gym and working out at home, sure, you could be practicing... or you could watch Netflix. Just two hours a week of dedicated, focused practice will beat 5 hours of distracted noodling. Not all but most exercises will show measurable results after 1 or 2 months of steady practice. Most people practice for week or so, get disappointed and try something else, an exercise first becomes second nature and then slowly starts showing in your playing."
