AskProgramming,ffqv7l4,t3_euqgdv,1580144390.0,"I'm not entirely sure what you mean here, but if you're saying that a lot more people seem to talk about programming (or code-adjacent items like language selection, library selection, framework selection, platform-selection) rather than actually doing anything, it's partly true (online.)

1. This particular subreddit is basically just about those things. I frequent the gamedev subreddit where it does have some discussion about those things, but also a ton of show-off stuff and technique building, which is very satisfying to watch. I love seeing someone post ""hey guys what do you think of this"" and then a year later watching them release their game on Steam. Like, I'm genuinely happy for them.
2. Reddit is frequented by a lot of students and would-be learners looking for advice. It's also frequented by people who are very rigid and black-and-white in their preferences and arguments. And you finally have a relatively small group of actual professionals (because a lot of people who program all day aren't interested in then coming here to talk about it, we just want to look at stupid memes.) So you end up with someone asking a legitimate question, like ""Is C# a good language?"" And you have armchair coders whose experience in arguing online greatly outmatches their experience in the industry (which is usually but not always zero or near enough), giving their opinions as if they were etched-in-stone fact. These often drown out people who actually work in the industry. This leads to those students eventually becoming jaded arguers themselves.
3. Finally, the number of creators is greatly outweighed by the number of relevant contributors, which are themselves outnumbered by the number of spectators and commentators.  Someone posted a cool graphic on it in regards to Wikipedia, but I can't be bothered to find it, but it's something along the lines of like 1% creators, 5% editors, and the rest are just viewers. The open source community is much the same way. Honestly, most people who create a baller open source project are just doing so because they want to have full creative control over something and know they're going to have to deal with a bunch of obnoxious red tape from product owners. And showing your work generally leads to either retreat or becoming a better programmer."

assholedesign,ffqe5k3,t1_ffpwel5,1580131867.0,"Credit cards have merchant fees associated with them. They are generally higher for vendors with lower volume. They are probably paying ~2.5-2.9% per transaction. So they are most likely passing it to you. While I understand the whole ""the customer shouldn't pay the merchant fee"" which I agree with almost always (I refuse to pay cash at any store), rent is a bit different.

It would be like if I told you I was going to pay you $100 for something, but then I insisted that we use a service that cost me nothing to send the money but cost you $2.50 to withdraw it. You might be somewhere annoyed because it doesn't feel like I paid you $100, it feels like I paid you $97.50. So you might ask me to send you the extra money to make up the difference. Now I feel like you're charging me $102.50. It's just an awkward situation because neither of us feels like we should have to pay the transaction fee.

It being rent compounds it further. As a homeowner, there are a lot of hidden costs that renters don't have to deal with. While I think that affordable housing is in a weird place right now, if I started renting out my house and calculated the amount of money per rent that I thought was fair, it would be highly annoying to then lose 2.5% on every transaction. I'd probably have to bump up the rent to make up the difference. But if we've already agreed that the rent should be $N, it's not like I can just increase that randomly.

The best situation would obviously be that the rent margin would be high enough that the merchant fee, while annoying, would be accounted for. It doesn't seem like that's the case? So it's kind of an annoying situation where the landlord would definitely prefer you to use a payment method that doesn't cost him anything, but if you do, you can pay for it yourself. And you don't really have any negotiating power here until your lease is up."

I'm almost positive it wouldn't be asked of me now that I have several years in the industry, but if an interviewer did ask me to just whiteboard perfect hashing or some equally ridiculous algorithmic nonsense that literally no one would implement without documentation, I'd probably laugh at them and let them know that I'm not going to be a good fit for whatever they're trying to do.

Show the reader that you spent more than 30 minutes on this post.

There are different speeds of SSD drives, though. When I built my new PC in July, I went from using an ok 256 gig SSD for Windows and a couple of games, and a disk drive for storage, to just using a much faster NVMe 1 TB SSD as my only drive. It impacts pretty much everything I do, but I'm a software developer which means I do have disk usage that outweighs the standard user I'd say."

programming,ff2x60v,t3_er7l59,1579527438.0,"Stuff like this reminds me that so many people who discuss programming online don't actually work in software development. IDEs make you far more productive. If they didn't, people wouldn't use them. ""But you gotta learn vi in case you need to edit a file remotely!"" This statement right here is what lets me know that someone doesn't work in this field. You do not edit files remotely in a production environment in 99.9~% of cases. You use your CI/CD tools and push that way. If you are opening and editing files on a production server, you have messed up. Why does your prod server even have the ability to recompile code in the first place? Ours have nothing but what is required to operate the applications running on them. The idea of a programmer being like ""yo guys I see it's busted lemme just ssh over and do a quick edit on the production server"" makes me super anxious.

If anything, teach the newbies that they can't do this. Force them, even in their personal projects, to assume that anything that touches the prod servers does so through the CI/CD pipeline. The only reasons to log onto a prod server are to apply updates and diagnose the CI/CD deployment services."

gaming,feoaw3b,t3_eq06bx,1579297543.0,"I kinda wish they weren't. I wish more people were playing cooperative games. Competitive gaming has contributed to the toxic sewer that so many gaming communities have become. As an example, I hopped on League of Legends recently with a couple of my buddies. We used to play a while ago competitively, now we just goof around in ARAM (which is a very not-serious mode in the game where everyone just gets a random character to screw around on.) Even in the not-serious mode, people are just massive jerks for basically no reason. Everyone is always looking for a reason why someone else is to blame. We'd leave matches and someone on the enemy team would just demand that we report someone who didn't have a great game, as if you need to play at a professional level to be allowed in.

Not saying cooperative games are the panacea, but something about highly competitive games just really causes some people to lose their chill and think they can just spew whatever vitriol they've been holding in all day."

The word you're looking for is ""anecdote."" An antidote is a medicine for counteracting a toxic substance. An anecdote is a short personal story.

For what it's worth, I agree. It's not really useful to use a personal story as evidence of widespread human behavior. It would be preferable to provide actual numbers."

AskReddit,fel623b,t1_fel5ftx,1579214829.0,"I might be in the minority here but I feel like too many games have been veering too ""dark"" so I respectfully disagree, although I do know where you're coming from. To be sure, Charnel and Pyro were plenty dark, what with their wanton slaughter and slavery, respectively. I think the humor added a lot to the game. It was certainly a product of its time though.

If they remade it (or a game of its ilk), I wouldn't mind the choice of at least a couple of dour gods (I think Persephone was probably the most ""serious"" god, funny enough.)

So I repurchased it when it came in the double pack with Messiah (which I never really got into, actually I might grab that when it goes on sale on GOG), and then I bought another copy and gave to a friend in the hopes that we could play it multiplayer (which never panned out, but he did play through the game and appreciated it.)

The wizard control for the UI wasn't too bad, but controlling your wizard and the battlefield at the same time felt awkward. Keep in mind I'm remembering it from like 15 years ago so it might be better than I recall, but I do remember struggling with the difficulty of the game when I first played it (and then came back a year or two later and beat it and loved every minute of it.)"
