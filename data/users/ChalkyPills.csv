acorns,ffsnuj7,t1_ffsmmw7,1580186572.0,Just answering the silly man's question.
acorns,ffsfu3i,t3_euz8ka,1580180670.0,"Well, today my account was down 1.3 % or so. Do the math."
acorns,ffs1xeq,t1_ffrnpwr,1580171134.0,"Exactly. If the American Stock Market goes 30 years without averaging at least 6 percent, the fact that you made less money than you hoped will be the least of your problems."
acorns,ffs1ij0,t3_euujs1,1580170856.0,"I get that Acorns is targeted towards new investors, but seriously, you should spend some time learning about how the stock market works. It'll help in the long run with your sanity. The Acorns app isn't a magic black hole that you yeet your money into."
financialindependence,fffy5ea,t3_etcndu,1579894358.0,Just tell him to buy SPY puts if he's that convinced.
lakers,fffxp20,t1_fffbw0o,1579894075.0,They normally take that long. I seem to remember a certain NFL running back whose ACL famously took five months.
investing,ffe4hyf,t1_ffdkxsj,1579836476.0,"I think another issue is VTSAX attempts to avoid incuring taxable events. If the increase in market cap is due to new shares rather than increased price that would cause a lag as they don't want to sell in order to rebalance. Also, they have so many fucking shares they need to be careful with selling."
MagicArena,ff9z8jt,t1_ff9k6pj,1579724670.0,That's wild how it fixes your spelling error and goes to right link.
nfl,ff9un4t,t1_ff77pi0,1579721761.0,Fuck a house. How come none of those dudes buy their momma an apartment complex and charge them reasonable rent?
stocks,ff6u25r,t3_erp4z8,1579634885.0,"Since you have such specific Goals, you should probably make your own fund on M1Finance. Set it to have all the stocks you're morally okay with in equal proportions. Pick a set of stocks that averages out to your desired yield."
wallstreetbets,ff5ywbq,t1_ff43qgd,1579614678.0,Got it. Thanks.
bestof,ff5ylxk,t1_ff5y68q,1579614440.0,"The only way you could possibly think rich people are neurotic is because you have either met no rich people, or a very small subset of them. Attributing negative characteristics to a entire group of people because it serves your personal agenda does not make you right.

Rich people, by definition, are less likely to be stressed. THAT'S THE FUCKING POINT OF BEING RICH."
financialindependence,ff5y8ou,t1_ff5kjgh,1579614131.0,No. This is the republicans serving rich people by creating more tax shelters for them. It has nothing to do with medical costs.
bestof,ff5y3pw,t1_ff5x3td,1579614013.0,">Too bad the rich are so neurotic.

I'm sorry, what? Please don't vote."

acorns,feij9vx,t1_fei4ts7,1579139819.0,Do you have no other investment accounts? They all have a delay.
acorns,fdnvh2q,t3_emddor,1578593667.0,If they are the same amount then you have paid no fees. If fees were being paid you would know.
lakers,fdnv1m7,t1_fdnawgl,1578593416.0,Shaq'd?
