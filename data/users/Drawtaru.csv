nextfuckinglevel,ffb7f1p,t1_ffaqiuq,1579753871.0,"No. They use DSLR cameras for nature documentaries. The P-series nikons are relatively cheap (I think they’re around $400? Too lazy to google) whereas the kind of cameras they use for documentaries—even if they’re also Nikon—are thousands of dollars, with full-frame sensors and interchangeable lenses that also cost thousands of dollars. 

The difference is in the sensor. Sensor qualities vary, but the size is the key factor. In most cases, the bigger the sensor, the better the image quality. Point-and-shoot cameras like the P-series nikons have very small sensors. 1080p video shot on a tiny sensor will not look as good as 1080p video shot on a larger sensor. And many DSLR cameras use a full-frame sensor, which is the largest commercially available."

I refused to sign it.  They didn't fire me, but sent me back to my own department.  That broke me.  I didn't care anymore.
