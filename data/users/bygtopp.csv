My sister is cheap. She wants to try all my 9mm pistols out so she can find one she likes. Well I’ve got 10 different 9mm. If you are going to run a few 100 round thru each and then expect me to pay and then also clean all my guns; you have another thing coming.

Revolvers are nice and simple but for a learner not a good idea. Short barrel and heavy power makes negative follow up shots. Limited to 5&6 shots vs the list above having 6-21 shots. Look at magazine capacity in your state.  Also once that info is found find out the extra cost of magazines. Remember two is one and one is none. 
Don’t settle for holsters. There are 1000s of holsters and companies 
Versacarry , Vedder, tier one, desantis. All depends on what you can carry and where you live 

Once comfortable carry a round in chamber. If you are attacked and your racking hand is busy you can’t fire and empty gun.
