todayilearned,fgknjxo,t1_fgk65iq,1580869591.0,You should post this as a life pro tip
RocketLeagueEsports,fgkarqk,t1_fgk7eqw,1580861239.0,I wouldn't disagree with that
RocketLeagueEsports,fgjm4d7,t1_fgjlrpj,1580846863.0,I see a lot of skylines. The octane and dom are probably 80%
RocketLeagueEsports,fgjiaim,t1_fgj8z39,1580844621.0,Probably not used enough by the general player base to justify making a separate decal for it.
RocketLeagueEsports,fgji645,t1_fgj9e7l,1580844550.0,I am still impressed by the fact they just said screw it and only made one side.

aww,fghk26f,t1_fghjn09,1580786586.0,"My grammar is nothing to write home about, but you clearly don't know how to use commas."
aww,fghfsvy,t1_fgh2k3c,1580783850.0,"In case you didn't figure out the joke. You missed the comma after mom, fookin your sentence real good. In a similar fashion to the way i fucked your mom last night."
RocketLeagueEsports,fgh4zkv,t1_fgh4y7a,1580776825.0,...
RocketLeagueEsports,fgh4rma,t1_fgh4pn9,1580776675.0,You have no point then...
RocketLeagueEsports,fggx9ia,t1_fggx2cl,1580771619.0,Big facts on that one.
RocketLeagueEsports,fggom50,t1_fggmkqj,1580766201.0,"Plungers can be stopped numerous different ways with other power ups....

Your rule is nothing is op if both sides have it and that is just blatantly wrong."

RocketLeagueEsports,fgg6pc7,t1_fgfitpm,1580755425.0,I think op is confusing ranked warriros demo chasing and the actual meta.
RocketLeagueEsports,fgg6n5y,t1_fgfue2p,1580755386.0,"Thats just flawed logic. Lets pretend a new mechanic came along that was completely unstoppable, but both teams could do it. It would definitely be OP.

I do agree demos are not OP mostly because the consistency issue with them."
RocketLeagueEsports,fgg6ibn,t1_fgfd62d,1580755299.0,"I watch a lot of rizzos content. He gets annoyed when people demo chase him. Thats completely different than a good demo. When its a quality demo you will hear a quick ""im dead"" from him with no complaints."
PoliticalHumor,fgg1baq,t1_fgfk0kn,1580752087.0,If you can't read this back and see how you are 100% part of the problem you seriously need to reevaluate yourself. You literally just did the exact same thing you are mad trump did.
RocketLeague,fgflwx5,t1_fgf4mmm,1580742226.0,It's more interesting coming from a player who also happens to be one if the top 3 players in NA
RocketLeagueEsports,fgexkbu,t1_fgex6w6,1580714019.0,"1) psyonix agrees tournaments are low on thr priority list

2) you cant have modded content on xbox and ps4 it would be a major pain. They would have to make a full on forge mode. Which leads back to the 6 month issue."
RocketLeagueEsports,fgev57o,t1_fgeuhmy,1580711186.0,"Leth makes awesome maps, i love his channel. However, he isn't making maps that are even close to game ready (with maybe 1-3 exceptions the portal map is pretty solid) . Psyonix also already tried rocket labs people hated it. They have a very successful game why on earth would they bother implementing something that already didn't work? There have been numerous rlcs lans before this one yet this is still the best month. The game is doing exceedingly well..."
RocketLeagueEsports,fgeucsl,t1_fgeu7fl,1580710326.0,"1) could split the player base. They dont want to make tournaments more popular. Tournaments were a good idea in practice but bad when applied. If they could fix the bug they already would have

2) they spend a ton of money to develop this feature and it completely dies in 6 months."
RocketLeagueEsports,fgeqku9,t1_fgeqf3a,1580706638.0,Name an easy change they could make that has no downside. People here completely ignore any risk psyonix would be taking when changing/adding anything.
RocketLeagueEsports,fgeq82d,t1_fgeq3xb,1580706323.0,"""easily"" lmao what some people on reddit people believe and whats actual reality are not the same thing"
RocketLeagueEsports,fgejnbp,t1_fgejdjm,1580701105.0,Everyone on reddit seems to think rocket league is not doing incredibly well its hilarious
RocketLeagueEsports,fgebjep,t1_fgd15pg,1580695808.0,Jesus are the downvotes really necessary?
RocketLeagueEsports,fge8t9y,t3_exxili,1580693976.0,Didn't rocket league have its best numbers on steam of all time last month???
RocketLeague,fgc9c3g,t3_exq6nj,1580670469.0,What in the actual fuck. That was insane
RocketLeagueEsports,fgc8vxk,t1_fg87n7o,1580670297.0,"If it wasn't for the png issue we wouldn't even have lan finals, lets be honest here."
RocketLeagueEsports,fg8d1lu,t3_exh5s7,1580615943.0,This better be sarcasm... As if that is remotely realistic for the revenue they generate.
RocketLeagueEsports,fg6u2di,t1_fg6i9o1,1580576882.0,He was basically trying to not look like an asshole. I think he accomplished that.
UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5itgt,t1_fg5i8v1,1580528638.0,You're so upset your jist spewing nonsense. Im going to call it a night at this point it feels like beating up a child.
UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5i57q,t1_fg5i1js,1580528112.0,Oh look a lazy unoriginal Down syndrome joke. You do know more people upvoted this post than complained about legality right? Seriously... Special kind of stupid
UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5hur9,t1_fg5hrju,1580527886.0,Im glad you finally found some meaning to your pointless life.
UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5hjix,t1_fg5hdms,1580527642.0,The bro was to mock you... God damn dude. I really feel bad for you.
UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5h21x,t1_fg5ff1x,1580527268.0,You are so reddit bro... Fucks sake mate. You are a special kind of stupid
UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5f7vu,t1_fg5esoi,1580525864.0,Wow... Seriously mate??
UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5ejpx,t1_fg5ei0c,1580525360.0,It really kills the fun in this sub that every single post gets the same stupid comment
malefashionadvice,fg5efvr,t3_ewphwg,1580525284.0,Is this satire? I really cant tell
UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5e5n7,t1_fg5e0qn,1580525077.0,And getting worked up over either in a place dedicated to unethical tips makes no sense

I feel like you figured it out at the end there."

UnethicalLifeProTips,fg5c43j,t1_fg45sex,1580523579.0,Yea most crimes are unethical...
lockpicking,fg5b8hq,t1_fg5a4i4,1580522947.0,This seems like a decent approach to dealing with any lock with spools
lockpicking,fg5asw2,t1_fg59jbz,1580522632.0,Im sorry Its just right there.... Thats what she said
lockpicking,fg5aqyc,t1_fg3tds3,1580522593.0,Burg for sure
RocketLeague,fg58w6n,t1_fg499i2,1580521227.0,Pretty sure you couldn't because hoops wasn't ranked then.
lockpicking,fg2e5at,t1_fg2dwp2,1580443292.0, I watch basically every BB upload so im with you. They just dont get the views. I think your assessment of lpls channel is spot on. I both like it and dislike at the same time.
lockpicking,fg29h9b,t3_ewcu26,1580440896.0,At this point he has a video on every major padlock sold in America. No offense to BB but not many people care about picking old/antique locks. Its either these videos or super high level locks and the effort required for those videos isn't practical.
lockpicking,fg26xu6,t1_fg26l5f,1580439679.0,Probably bought it to make that video
RocketLeagueExchange,fg1n86h,t1_fg1mzaw,1580430163.0,To be honest part of the reason why I offered him a good price was because we wouldn't have needed a middleman. I have good rep but it's all like a year old so I can't imagine you'd want to go first
RocketLeagueExchange,fg1lo83,t1_fg1lgpr,1580429335.0,Thanks man!
RocketLeagueExchange,fg0zgiu,t1_fg0zepo,1580418017.0,Thanks anyways mate. Happy trading!
RocketLeagueEsports,fg0y4pr,t1_fg0iqu7,1580417315.0,Id take that.
RocketLeagueEsports,fg0y2ak,t1_fg0ddtq,1580417277.0,Do you have a specific reason why you dont think sizz is a good coach?
RocketLeagueEsports,fg0xsxd,t1_fg0m2fx,1580417132.0,Summary?
RocketLeagueExchange,fg0l0x7,t1_ffyrdos,1580409931.0,Would you be interested in a second one at the same price?
nbadiscussion,fg045fj,t1_fg01khj,1580399811.0,"As a researcher I can tell you you're wrong about that. Every major journal has strict word counts for manuscript submissions. You do not put anything that is not necessary in a manuscript, you write as susinctly as possible...

Modern journalism actually advocates for longer articles so they can put more advertisements on the sides of the screen.

I don't particularly have an issue with this post, but i agree with the orginal comment i responded to."
nbadiscussion,ffzzbsv,t1_ffzz5r5,1580396679.0,It is a hindrance to discuss when your main points get lost in fluff.
nbadiscussion,ffzvsxt,t1_ffzumte,1580394205.0,A general rule of writing is write succinctly. There are a good amount of unnecessary sentences in this post.
RocketLeagueEsports,ffyk5d3,t1_ffyk0po,1580348355.0,I think sizz is also smarter than we give him credit for. But also yes lol
RocketLeagueEsports,ffy8qc5,t1_ffxycd7,1580340758.0,"As counterintuitive as this sounds, you're probably right. If you have players who can get down on themselves easy Jon would be a good moral booster. He'd be an amazing assistant coach lol"
RocketLeagueEsports,ffxn0go,t1_ffxmu02,1580328440.0,You earned all the downvotes by using only cliche Reddit comebacks though...
RocketLeagueEsports,ffxkfsk,t1_ffw67zf,1580326947.0,Everyone is roasting him but tbf not a single other comment was made... Soooo
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvtt1t,t1_ffvtph4,1580273055.0,Me and another guy have had a pretty long discussion on the topic here. Feel free to comment if you disagree or agree with what we said so far.
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvtqm1,t1_ffvt2yi,1580272999.0,"Im saying they have their reasons. Many people seem to think their opinion on this subjective decision is right. While i also agree they need to give more organizations the go ahead to do it. The reality is they might not have the staff to manage these events to the standard they want/need too. Or they just straight-up dont want to.

Cant really disagree that they should be pushing more merch thats easy money. Same with more esports items in game.

My point isn't that they are a perfect company, it is that they are actually doing a damn good job and are highly undervalued."
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvstgs,t1_ffvsq5u,1580272241.0,You can get permission to have a larger prize pool (again they are real strict with who they accept). They are also protecting growth by making sure every rocket league event is done properly
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvse8d,t1_ffvs4ge,1580271907.0,"Sounds like they straight up only want ""big"" events held by them. Again, protecting their product. If you worked really hard to make something you might be hesitant about letting someone else use your IP without your involvement."
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvq0q3,t1_ffvptpi,1580270091.0,"No drawbacks seen by the community... The 5k limit is not a hard limit you can get permission to go above it. Rumor has it they're not very responsive to request though unfortunately. The limit is set so they can control the fate of their own product, which makes a lot of sense. im assuming you haven't thought about that."
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvpqfe,t1_ffvpmqc,1580269876.0,At the very least I would like to see them remove the 5K limit for JBs events.
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvpfbj,t1_ffvp8br,1580269651.0,Im being realistic... There are a lot of draw backs to trying to push essentially a whole new game. There is a reason they haven't done it. Or are you one of those people who thinks they are just completely incompetent and have no idea what they're doing? Even though they've grown a successful company and leauge.
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvm382,t3_evaop8,1580267335.0,Tldr: he is staying in the rl community he just isn't sure what his focus will be yet.
RocketLeagueEsports,ffvlem3,t3_evgfx0,1580266867.0,Would they make their money back on a 50k prize pool? Don't get me wrong I love 1v1 but the views just aren't there for that kind of prize pool.
RocketLeagueEsports,fftjt3a,t1_ffsv234,1580222410.0,....
RocketLeagueEsports,ffslgdu,t3_euyrny,1580184653.0,Rogue not related? I'll take it
