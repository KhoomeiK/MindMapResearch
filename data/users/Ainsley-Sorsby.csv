My impression reading him was that he was very sharp, a very good observer of the human condition, but at the same time, reading both his essays and his life story, he often sounds like a man who really really needed a hug.

For instance, he comes of as a bit...bitter about women* in his writtings and i would guess it has something to do with his mother issues: His parents divorced when he was very young and he blamed his mother, and her many lovers, for the fact that he basically grew up without a father figure

One of my favourite essays of his, is the one where he argues that not only is suicide a perfectly normal thing to do, but when a person close to use decides to commit suicide, whe should be happy for him, because he finally found the strength to free himself from life, but instead we try to prevent them from doing it, which is a very selfish thing to do, since that way we put our own good above their own, as in we value our personal pain of separation over their freedom of choice. He was also an antinatalist, meaning he was against having children and we ought to just...stop doing it until the species goes extinct
