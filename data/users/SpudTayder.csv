apexlegends,ffb9qb6,t1_ffb9mie,1579756459.0,I'm definitely for balancing. If the devs want a mixed input game then aa balancing should pretty much be priority.
apexlegends,ffb6p1u,t1_ffb53aj,1579753253.0,"Aa has existed before the availablility of crossplay and the shift  from console to PC. Aa is a vital component to making controllers a viable input for fps games, even if the game is console only. Without it, the stick input is horribly inaccurate and would have probably killed the console industry or at least fps games in the console industry. 

M&k have the advantage of multiple muscle groups controlling the aim input. Controller just can't do this. Aa is a stand in for this. Does it mean it plays differently? Absolutely. You still have to work 100% of the time to aim precisely with a mouse, but it's at least possible to work 100% of the time. With a controller you need to do 90% of the work while the software takes care of the last 10%. And before anyone jumps to ""That's unfair!"" the software *has* to take care of the last 10% because it is near impossible for the user to operate a controller and input that last 10% themselves. 

Aa should not aim for you. Anyone who has played a console fps knows that aa does not aim for you. The small amount of tracking (and it usually is small) is still impacted heavily by your own input and at best slows your reticle across player models. At worst someone runs across your reticle while you're aiming at someone else and it drags you off course."
apexlegends,ffasujy,t3_esktai,1579743694.0,"It really is as simple as asking yourself, ""why does aim assist exist for controllers?"" and you'll most likely go to the answer ""because controller aim input isn't as senitive/accurate/responsive etc is a mouse"". Aa is inherently a controller based adaption that is to simulate the precision of movement available to someone with a mouse to level the playing field. 

Obviously there's a balance between leveling the playing field and giving people aimbots. But aa does not mean ""aimbot"" automatically. If you really believe it does, then I suggest you go use a controller. If devs get the balance of aa wrong, it's bad for controller users too. It takes away the fun of the game. 

Complaining about aa (properly balanced) in a cross play game would be the same as controller players complaining that m&k users get to use extra forearm muscles for aim control.

At the end of the day, controllers are an inferior input for fps games. Aa helps to level this. No, it shouldn't be op, but that's for the devs to sort out."
apexlegends,ffaq5gh,t1_ffambpt,1579741886.0,"If controllers are keeping pace with m&k then aa is working correctly. 

If you see repeated examples of controller players regularly on top of the leaderboards then aa may be op and need tweaking.

The two can absolutely co-exist, it's just a balance that needs to be struck."

unpopularopinion,fd7mcsw,t3_ek92nf,1578206686.0,"The best we can hope to do is slow it down. There's some arguments that I've read saying that we simply don't have the technologic ability to prevent carbon emissions on a global scale without seriously impacting our way of life. For second and third world countries, the adjustments would mean vast population losses mostly to starvation. For first world countries it means, as you say, to go back to a pre-industrial way of life. And this is just to just slow the climate change. Eventually we would still end up at the same destination. 

One person argued that we would be better off developing technology to cope with climate change rather than try slow it. I kinda see their point. If ultimately climate change is going to happen, wouldn't we be better off developing adaptive technologies than cut ourselves off from carbon producing industries, that *could* have saved us. The very thing that got us in this mess, could get us out of it alive. *Maybe*. But without it, we would have no hope of developing the necessary technology, and would ultimately end up in a world we aren't capable of surviving in.

Edit: tl;dr: we either double down on industry in the hope we can develop adaptive technologies. Or we give up on industry for the sake of a reduction of carbon emissions and accept that we are living on borrowed time."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fczptqz,t1_fcy6jvp,1578106476.0,"It's more to do with the moral justification in this part of the discussion, rather than ""fixing a problem"" per se.

There's a certain arguement that the modern way we are dealing with sex needs to be addressed. The idea that casual sex has been glorified and instead, sex needs to be reassessed as a society and given the weight it deserves. That it's a deeply intimate physical act that carries with it some significant consequences. The rise of the concept of casual sex and promiscuity can perhaps be pointed to as a root cause, and abortion merely a symptom of something deeper that needs to be addressed. 

I understand that if you accept that the fetus does not have human rights, then this is an open and closed issue. It's partly why I'm not against abortion, I feel that the rights of the mother should not be infringed upon to serve something that does not yet possess rights.

Like how easily people will dismiss the rights of the male in the equation. For arguements sake, is it OK to deny a person the existence of their own child, purely because on biology? The decision to keep or destroy the child is entirely up to the mother because of biological fluke? Let alone the arguement that goes down the path of ""where does life begin?"". At what point does abortion become murder? It's hard, and I don't think anyone should say they are comfortable with their opinion on abortion.

And on the second point, that's exactly what I mean by ""it's intensely complicated.""

Not necessarily at the detriment of the woman, but purely from a perspective that once a child in conceived, there *are* multiple parties in play.

Abortion is complicated as there are multiple parties involved. Some parties (specifically, the foetus) are debated as to whether they have any rights as all.

""Society"" can ask whatever uncomfortable questions it desires. Men are not exempt from ""societies"" scrutiny either. There are no rights afforded to men or that are not afforded to women in this area. In my country, an employer cannot legally ask a woman (or man) what their childbearing plans are, and certainly cannot discriminate against them if they choose to share them.

If you're talking about fighting for abortion laws or against them, then that's another matter all together. It's a very inflammatory topic that is far from black and white. Definitely fight for which ever rights you believe you should have. But it's important to know that men and women exist on both sides of that arguement. 

On the topic of abortion it's very difficult to discuss it in the realm of ""equal rights"" as it's exclusively a procedure for women. The man involved has no legal part to play in the procedure or the decision/consent process. Abortion is not a form of contraception so can't be compared to male vs female access to contraceptives.

trashy,fcozx6j,t1_fcoyjw7,1577846256.0,"Yeah, as far as I'm concerned. The concept he puts forward relies on one race being more powerful than another. The more powerful race is able to exert a level of race based prejudice that the other races are incapable of."
trashy,fcnmzzg,t1_fcnm1gp,1577814577.0,"I'm qualified in radiology. I have no humanities qualifications but I have a big interest in social issues. 

I find that usually this line of arguement is between two parties, one that views racism as a specific version of prejudice based on race and one that views racism as a prejudice that can only be exerted by those in power. I am in the former party. I don't believe you need any special powers to be prejudicial."

trashy,fcni6eb,t1_fcndqki,1577812207.0,The definition of racism is universal. You are misrepresenting the sociologicist / psychologists you reference. The studies mostly outline how racism serves those in power rather than being an objective tool wielded only by those in power.

trashy,fcmggfm,t1_fcmf668,1577774331.0,"Your opinion of racism literally depends on white people being a superior race and is, therefore, inherently racist.

To be clear, I believe in the real type of racism which involves the discrimination of someone based solely on their race. Yet for some reason people, yourself included, insist on a different version of the term ""racism"" that requires white people to be the most powerful race just so that other races can get away with racism. Really odd trade off, imma stick with my version where everyone is equal and held to the same standards."
trashy,fcmg36v,t1_fcme8dl,1577773945.0,"Adding extra criteria to a term doesn't make the new criteria valid. 

If you have prejudice in the context of race, then that is racism. The end. 

If you have prejudice in the context of sex, that is sexism. The end.

If you have prejudice in the context of class, that is classism. The end.

All of these ""isms"" are already subcategories of prejudice. Adding extra special criteria is just an excuse to justify bad behaviour."
