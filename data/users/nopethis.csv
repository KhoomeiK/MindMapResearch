Futurology,ffd7n6a,t1_ffbz95r,1579815000.0,"the real issue is that for the majority of farmers (aka any non factory megafarm) the regulation that obama admin added cost a lot of money in taxes not for pollution but for rainwater runoff.  So in theory if you had a large horse farm or orchard you were paying a shit ton of money for having a large structure on your property, even if nothing was running into the ground aside from rainwater off the roof and your whole operation was pesticide free. (its more complicated than that but w/e)

So what happens is that the above tax gets bundled in with all the other regulations and the voting population gets mad. If it were mostly about the actual protection of the water and waterways farmers (aka voting farmers) would be mostly happy with the bill. But with everything lumped into one bill it makes the whole bill easy for big AG and the farm lobbies to denigrate and make sure that ""everyone"" hates the bill."

Its probably not the best idea to have someone split up and then happen to get back together at the exact random moment they are needed. At least not every step along the way. But that being said, its part of the suspended belief that is present in most stories.  I know that in reality someone like Jack Reacher (or any man book series hero) would never be in so many, ""the world needs you to save it!"" chance encounters, but you (the reader) buy in, because otherwise there would be no story.  

So let go of your modern sensibilities regarding planning. I assume that maybe you are young enough not to have grown up without a cell phone? You and your friends would agree to go to a place and do something, and if someone did not show up, you would wait a bit and then probably just go along without them assuming they couldnt make it.  They might later catch up with you.  ""figured after the party you would end up here"" or they maybe didnt.  

As someone else pointed out, modern horror movies often eliminate cell phones immediately either by gimmick...ooops dropped my phone...or some other method. But it is done to isolate the protagonist, after all, otherwise they would just be calling for help all the time."
