AskReddit,ffjs7jj,t3_etzt89,1580005521.0,"Yea.. I’ve always imagine a pig going out shopping. Probably because my nursery book depicted it as such. It was probably buying sausages and I never put things together. Until now, you monster!"

nfl,fffmiqn,t1_ffflf8y,1579887161.0,Barber would take the team to the goal line and Jacobs would pound it in. Great RB combo
nba,ff4e6vg,t1_ff3ix5r,1579561493.0,"yea... that’s not what I was saying... at all. And yes, I do know a good deal more about history than most people, probably yourself included. It’s kinda like... my job."

nba,ff39yfd,t1_ff37rg4,1579537124.0,"Amazing the difference between a post title and actually listening to his comments. I thought he said something dumb when I read the title and realized he made a valid point when I listened to his interview. And I don’t care much for Kyrie, but damn, to criticize him for this is a bridge too far."
todayilearned,fez3ych,t1_feymc7b,1579453615.0,"Also, it’s probably wise to avoid travel on a cruiser carrying munitions in a war zone that may or may not have been fitted with guns and would have rammed and sank u-boats it encountered. 

You are absolutely correct though, war sucks and innocent lives lost is never a good thing on either side of conflict."

AskReddit,fd7fc8s,t1_fd3kyuj,1578203588.0,Brad Williams ruins dwarf jokes by creating a career solely telling one joke with the punchline being that he’s short. I liked him back when I knew him personally but that is precisely the type of comedy I find painfully unfunny. Dwarf jokes are funny when it’s unexpected and creative. You can imagine how most dwarf jokes fail on both those fronts.
AskReddit,fd7ew3b,t1_fd42avl,1578203395.0,"Depends on the type of dwarfism but yea I have somewhat restricted range of motion. For me, I cannot lift my arms straight up in the air. Though not as bad as John McCain was. Some people have fused knuckles and cannot bend their fingers."
AskReddit,fd7elz2,t1_fd40upw,1578203264.0,"Midget is an older term referring to people with hypopituitary dwarfism which is usually dealt with in developed countries by giving shots of growth hormone and the person then grows. These people are proportionally small. In my case, I have a large upper body and short arms and legs, I am not proportional so in the true sense of the word I’m a dwarf but not a midget. Since the midgets went away(hiding as normies) other normies just started applying it to the remaining dwarfs."
AskReddit,fd7dy8r,t1_fd3lo4d,1578202984.0,It’s usually the same or a bit shorter but it would depend on the specific condition the individual has.
bestof,fd56az0,t1_fd51zk6,1578174612.0,The Tohono O’odham in southern Arizona let the US government build telescopes just north of their most sacred mountain on Kitt Peak. Pretty cool of them to do that.
nfl,fcz0nbh,t3_ejhnlt,1578091274.0,Of course if they run the PA more frequently the defenses will be more ready for that type of play and probably the success rate suffers. Not saying I’m an expert on the Browns offensive woes but as a youth coach I see diminishing returns on repeated plays.
interestingasfuck,fcwsdlg,t1_fcwnh8z,1578035678.0,I am a dwarf and the thing I noticed wasn’t the height as much as the width.  I’d really have to spread my legs to be able to ride it. Though I can imagine that might be an issue for normies as well.
nfl,fcok4z5,t1_fcogh0m,1577834255.0,"You’re right... but luckman played in an era where the defense could actually hit the quarterback as others correctly pointed out, it really was a different era and largely a different game, I was going off statistics rather than a hard analysis of their play styles as it relates to our modern game. I’ve never understood why they didn’t just put in a running back and commit to the run almost completely since the passing game was so inept back then. of course Cutler is probably the better of the two in real terms but he was mostly average (ish) and when luckman played he was pretty good. luckman also played before they let black people play... clearly he was against inferior opponents regardless if the best players were off to war."
nfl,fcnsl3r,t1_fcngp66,1577817618.0,"Yea it was a lot easier to be successful before the AFL merger. Halas won 8 titles as coach in addition to founding the league and playing in it. Though my grandfather, who knew him, maintained Lombardi was a better man."
todayilearned,fcnrllq,t3_ei537n,1577817101.0,Do you want people looking like the Hapsburgs? Because this is how that happens.
nfl,fcnmkzk,t1_fcnjj2h,1577814353.0,I’m sorry for upsetting you!! Were we arguing? I’m just a sucker for semantics!
nfl,fcnic15,t1_fcng7f1,1577812289.0,I thought the context was best bears QBs in the last 100 years... not the last 35...
nfl,fcnerd9,t1_fcne3nd,1577810220.0,Either one makes a good point how bad the Bears have done at QB. Neither are terrible but nor should it be an argument between them who is the best QB for a franchise.

nfl,fcnda61,t1_fcncwx1,1577809262.0,Sid was our best in 100 years.
EverythingScience,fc6do97,t1_fc66wuf,1577478117.0,I bet we could just about all agree that we’d rather have one less meth-using human than lose a 4000 year old tree. Damn it Florida.
