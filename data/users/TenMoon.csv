MomForAMinute,fef8hun,t1_fef6nrh,1579050683.0,"I gave mine a unisex name. Oddly enough, my oldest daughter asked me if she had an older brother. I had never mentioned my previous pregnancy but somehow my daughter knew about the lost baby. There was no earthly way she could have known."

Your parents are nuts to put that burden on you, particularly since they also expect you to be the live-in maid. 

Go to your new life with *this* mom's blessing."

JUSTNOMIL,fe1mkr9,t1_fe0gfup,1578828385.0,"Wow. Reminds me of a time when I was a sterile compounder and our hospital hired a new pharmacist. Our IV room pharmacists mostly stayed out of the clean room, but were needed at times to do things like give approval when resetting the TPA compounding pump. Anyway, every single person who went into the clean room had to pass two sterility tests, the first being a fingertip test. The person gowns up, washes up, puts gloves on, and finally, touches plates of agar with the expectation that no fingertip will transmit bacteria to the plate. New pharmacist failed nine out of ten fingertips. (A record?) I always wondered what she did to end up failing so utterly."

Christianmarriage,fd8qw9n,t3_eka9z2,1578222071.0,"His assertion that he is asexual is making me wonder if he is telling you the truth or if he's cheating on you. After all, he lied about being Christian when you got married. 

The same thing happened to me. We went to church together, but all that ended after the wedding. He hid his porn habit and his chasing other women from me until a few years into our marriage. I don't know if he's backslidden or if he was ever saved in the first place, but I can't live with him any longer."
Christianmarriage,fd66ch0,t3_ek5es6,1578186147.0,"Historically, extended families were the norm, and functioned quite well. If you want to get your own place, that's fine, but if finding a way to share quarters with your in-laws to help them financially works for you, then that's also fine. I second the idea of a mother-in-law suite with a separate entrance for privacy and autonomy for both couples."

I get foot rubs, my laundry done, and when we're home, he does the vast majority of the cooking. Pretty sure your boyfriend doesn't treat you well no matter where you are.
