JRPG,fh9abya,t1_fh99ssh,1581376667.0,"Ehh Woah there. Most thieves have abysmal strength, making them actually quite difficult to use, as the double hit doesn't make up for it. Swordmasters, by contrast, typically have nearyl the same good speed to double while still having strength to actually hurt something. 

If you play a thief, chances are it's for stealing/opening chests, not because they are a natural choice for combat."
boardgames,fh99xp5,t1_fh96bis,1581376413.0,"Lol. The whole game is meta based. Like, it's just a bluffing game. Contessa is pretty weak if people don't play assassin, and you can always call out the assassin instead of claiming contessa. Ambassador doesn't actually accrue coins, which you need to do anything. Duke can be strong if you can't find a way to deny his accrual or kill him first. Assassin requires coins that a captain denies.

I've played this game to death and back again. Most end game 1v1s come down to a simple question of whether you think they have x or y card. That's it. The rest are already decided and it's the leaders game to lose by failing to realize the guaranteed victory. There is no such thing as a weak card, simply the meta and expectations about what someone will do. 

Claiming a contessa against an assassination attempt to force your opponent to waste 3 coins, giving you the advantage to accrue to 7 first, can work. So can stealing their coins and forcing them to call out your captain or die to a coup."
JRPG,fh8z33f,t1_fh8r7z4,1581370324.0,"Well, in all fairness it's difficult to really control stat boosts in FE games. Typically only certain classes can steal (thief), and those are the naturally fastest class. Stealing is basically a non-issue in FE beyond the positioning requirements."
boardgames,fh8fh5k,t1_fh7yae1,1581358622.0,"So my friend group played the absolute shit out of this game, and an entire meta developed.

1. Manage your threat level. It can seem great to stockpile a ton of gold and then assassinate someone while still having 7 gold for a coup. But suddenly everyone wants to kill you and you'll be eliminated early.

2. There are basically two phases of coup: two card phase and 1 card phase. The two card phase is over once everyone only has one card. This is where bluffs get called more often, so having an ambassador can be useful to keep people guessing. Ambassador is great to block stealing and manage your threat level, since using an ambassador is generally neutral to accumulating power/gold. Likewise, people will fish for assassins, captains, or contessa in the one card phase.

3. Always claim to have a captain. A true captain doesn't hide and proudly proclaims he is in the captains club. Captains look for cash cows (dukes), and do not accuse other captains. Unless you are captain of the captains club (double captain), in which case you stand above all, and any remaining captains must bow to your authority. Fake captains will be ridiculed and all remain captains must stone them for heresy. A similar punishment is required of any captains that sacrifice their captain, except for the captain of the captain's club, who must obviously make the greatest sacrifice."

u_mrstackz,fh141yr,t3_f0zph5,1581210662.0,"I'll concede that it's awkward to have a character 'die' in game while still being integral to the story. However, from a mechanics view, it's necessary. For instance, suikoden tactics is an SRPG where important characters retreat but can never die. So you basically feel pushed to field them because they can always Yolo out, while some random recruit will die. In a game with like a hundred characters to recruit, it's annoying to feel penalized for using killable characters.

The thing I love about PoR is the limited exp mechanic. That's what sets it above anything else. You are actively rewarded for min maxing, but by the time you are gods among men the game is over. Recent games reward broken strategies with broken characters that feel godly simply due to having gale force. It's just a grind to get the right ability combos. PoR severely limits that, so if you want to use wrath you better lean into Nephenee. And the chapters have way better variation: managing crows on ships, fighting in the desert, the priest level. Three houses seems like an absolute bore in comparison by map/objective design."
technews,fgum0v3,t1_fguhc6m,1581124151.0,"Lol. Do you know how software has worked for decades? Cause two decades ago software came with what is called a ""shrinkwrap"" license because software was a CD in a fucking box with some terms and conditions, and the best a company like MSFT could do is try and use product keys and hope nobody cracked it because you could prevent Word from ever trying to verify the code over the internet. The perpetual license model of software is a relatively new model. Exponentially so for cars.

Also, yes, I agree that if Tesla ever pushes a software update, it will want an agreement governing that update. Somebody has to assent to that at some point, namely the current owner.

Perhaps where you're missing things, is Tesla can still fuck up. Surprise. It is perfectly possible and legal for Tesla to sell a car ""as-is"" with a feature or with a contract that does not explicitly note the absence of a software feature. Regular cars do it with non-software features all the time. Tesla can put a sticker on the car advertising ""XYZ features"" and fail to add a proper disclaimer that the feature will be disabled without an add-on purchase. Tesla could have sold the car prior to the auction with the features, got hit with the lemon law and took it back, put it at auction with the features, and then failed tell people it planned to disable them.

To use your phrasing, just because the car feature is software doesn't mean it magically becomes a license required feature. It doesn't get immunity from the way things have worked in ~~cars~~ personal property for ~~decades~~ more than a century. It is perfectly possible for a Tesla car to have an autopilot feature, and it simply doesn't get updated because the new owner has not assented to the terms and conditions."
technews,fgudtr2,t1_fgu2z01,1581118380.0,It's not even that the law is behind. It's simply that tech bros bluster there way through faster and richer than people can sue to keep up.
technews,fgudgzv,t1_fgub8hr,1581118137.0,"Again. Sources. Most of what I see indicates the rights go with the car, not the owner. Like someone that buys a new tesla can't get the software upgrades moved from the old ones.

And again, software isn't some magical thing outside the law. People have been buying used cars for decades without a new agreement with the manufacturer. This idea that all software must be licensed is just flat out wrong. I don't know how else to say it. You don't need diddly squat with the manufacturer to buy a used car and run software on it. We've been doing that ever since a cd player was first installed in the damn things.

Obligations by the manufacturer may be transferred, like warranties, but I don't have to have some agreement with tesla to buy a tesla. Maybe if I want software upgrades I need to sign something, but that's far and away different from what we are discussing.

As for the contract, your right, it's more like theft. I had a car with a feature clearly worth $x, and tesla took it from me with intent to deprive me. Maybe it's justified, but if it's not it looks like theft to me."
technews,fgu1rs6,t1_fgtykl3,1581112184.0,"I'm gonna need some sources for this claim. And the idea that using software means you agree to terms only works if the terms are made available to you. This isn't a websites privacy policy.

Again, software is not some magical construct outside the law. If I was sold a car with a feature, and then the feature was taken away, the default position is that's breach of contract. The burden is on Tesla to prove why they had that right. There is no basic assumption that you don't get to keep software unless you provide proof of payment. In fact, there is an implied license to use software you are provided."
technews,fgtvs6i,t1_fgtti0d,1581110010.0,"So the issue is the sale between tesla and the dealer, not the dealer and the consumer. Sure, the dealer is liable.

technews,fgtr1uf,t1_fgtp4hj,1581108207.0,"I did some quick searching, and have not found a conclusive source for this. Do you have one?

technews,fgtpdxp,t1_fgtk7qq,1581107670.0,"Sure, but if the contract doesn't clearly state whether those features are enabled or not, and the car is delivered with those features, they are now included. Like, the resolution of this issue is simple: Tesla can simply include in all contracts a nice little table of features with a checkbox of what is and isn't included, or some other system. The fact that software can be enabled and disabled with a few clicks doesn't magically change how contracts for personal property are governed."
technews,fgtokvw,t1_fgtjanr,1581107317.0,"Really, made no assumptions? What proof is there in the Verge article that the dealer chose not to pay for a feature, beyond Tesla stating such? The Verge article DOES state the dealer paid for a car with those features. If anything, Verge made vague statements regarding the sale. Which is precisely my point: you assumed to the benefit of Tesla. I'm not gonna trust Tesla to say ""oh yeah we meant to disable that,"" just as much as I wouldn't trust the dealer if they said ""oh but Frank at Tesla told me it would stay enabled despite the BoS stating otherwise."""
technews,fgtnq2k,t1_fgtbvfb,1581106946.0,"by dealer, do you mean Tesla? Tesla delivered a car with a feature. Months later, they turned it off. Sounds like what you called theft to me."
technews,fgtnc1m,t1_fgt0n9i,1581106878.0,"uh what? the proof is in the fact the buyer drove off in a car with the feature enabled. If I buy a car with a turbocharger and the dealer forgot to mention it or charge me for it, their unilateral mistake is not on me. I get to keep it. Tesla sold a car with a feature, and they need to prove the feature was not included in the sale."
technews,fgtmspr,t1_fgt5qog,1581106635.0,"Ehh, if they want to go with some assinine non-transferable licensing model for features, that's fine. I think it obviously diminishes the value of those features, since I have zero use for it after I sell the car, but I can't get any resale value from it since it's non-transferable. It works with like, windows software since even if I change machines, I'm still running windows, and most licenses allow for hardware transfers, just not user transfers. If I can no longer recoup $5k from that $8k feature I bought via resell, then I have to decide if the feature is worth more than $3k."
technews,fgtlue5,t1_fgt2e2k,1581106297.0,"While I agree with you on the general take for software licensing, I think in this case the facts we currently have are that Tesla did not state these features would be removed. The licensing issue is interesting, but since this is coming from Tesla one could argue an implied license due to the presence of the features.

Regardless, unless Tesla makes it a non-transferable license, it will generally transfer. I think one of the articles even stated that used cars won't have features removed as a price negotiation tactic, so they may not be pushing the cloud software license model. 

It would be interesting if someone could weigh in on whether Tesla grants non-transferable licenses to certain features or not."

technews,fgtkczz,t1_fgtffd2,1581105666.0,"Such as? I've yet to see anyone except Tesla say the dealer didn't buy the feature.

If I buy a car and the dealer tells me it's got a turbocharger but 'forgets' to tell me it costs extra or charge for it on the invoice, I would say tough luck. He signed the deal.

You can auction off a part and detail what it does and does not come with. That's fine. But if you auction off A, B, and C, and don't tell me that I'm only buying part A until after I've paid, then you are committing fraud in just about any state."

Do you read it? Perhaps the article isn't providing all the information, but I certainly read it. Nothing in there says the dealer chose not to pay for those features. It simply says the dealer bought a car with certain features enabled and advertised. Perhaps the dealer and Tesla came to a different arrangement, in which case yes the dealer is at fault, but that's not what the article says.

Just because Tesla said the dealer didn't pay for features doesn't make it true. I'm certainly not inclined to believe them in the face of evidence that a car was advertised and sold with such features and with no contradictory evidence that the dealer intended to not pay for those features."

That's like buying anything else that turns out to be worth more than the seller thought. Unless Tesla can point to something like a contract stating those features are not enabled, it's a blatant attempt to bait and switch the buyer. Contract law is very well developed to handle issues of mistakes like this, and software doesn't change that. My instinct is that a judge/jury won't feel sorry for Tesla and will tell them to refund the cost of that feature or turn it back on.

Nobody wants to be left holding the bag when the stock price comes down, so if it looks like the business is gonna get fucked, investors will bail, driving the stock price down, defeating the purpose of increasing short term profits by sacrificing long term gains.

The problem with video games is that new IPs are risky, while pumping out a new COD is not. Activision knows it will make good money on COD for the investment. Frankly, making annual or biannual reskins of games is safer for long term growth than trying out a new IP, so the whole argument of short term profits can actually fall flat in that regard.

On the new IP side, there's shit like Anthem, which everyone knew needed more time in the oven, but BioWare fucked around for so many years that EA told them to just release it. I can't blame EA as being short term profits motivated when they basically bankrolled a project for over 5 years that was only seriously worked on for less than 18 months. That's EA holding BioWare accountable, and BioWare sacrificing their brand name and loyalty to fuck around without direction. 

So again, new IPs are pretty risky, because it's easy to waste time and money on a project that ultimately goes nowhere due to incompetent developers that tried to scale a project up before the direction was set. That's not to say publishers are holy and it's all the devs fault, but when games need to sell 1mil+ units to justify their development and marketing costs, or otherwise have microtransactions to get more than $60/buyer (before fees to various platforms/engines/middlemen), it's tough to expect a ton of new IP rather than iterative approaches to already well performing IPs."

I don't disagree that the legal education system can be a racket, but it serves a purpose. All barriers to entry can be criticized for transferring some benefit to one party at the expense of another.

I can say with confidence that I probably could have passed my state's bar exam, which is one of the most difficult in the country, with maybe 6-9 months of studying and less than $20,000 for a tutor/study materials, rather than 3 months of studying after three years of law school and $300,000 in tuition. I also work in a field where a lot of the work I do can be done by someone without a law degree. All that said, many people without law degrees in my field fail to appreciate many nuances of the practice, and many lawyers in my and other fields are downright stupid. 

In many ways, legal practice is like so many other fields with barriers to entry that don't meaningfully reflect actual ability.

Hell, even the revert back mechanic doesn't mean the story is bad. A bad story is bad because story wasn't a focus, not because it's incompatible with a specific game design. 

As for (B), well, yeah that's the rub. And frankly it only really applies to the loot driven Diablo inspired games. WoW and FF14 have a straightforward grind forward. Do the hardest content you can until you get all the gear, then move onto the next and repeat. It's certainly a rat race, but I don't see it as all that different from grinding out Lynals or guardians in BOTW. It's a slow plod forward. It never ends because a new expansion comes out that creates more content, but assuming that comes with a new campaign/story, what's to hate? I play a game to enjoy the journey, not the end credits, and the ending has a minimal impact on the journey. FF15 is a great game until you get near the end, and as long as you ignore that bit, you can have a great time romping around with the boys."

boardgames,ffcy70y,t1_ffcvpos,1579809713.0,"Well, since you elaborate, my problem with dominion is more so the lack of interaction. A computer algorithm could solve dominion fairly easily for any given set of cards with minimal deviations from a strategy determined at the start of the game. It's a probability issue that, as you point out, can be controlled fairly well. And, while obviously bad deck building is bad, if two people play the exact same strategy, one can win over the other due to simple luck in the cards, which for me indicates a lack of agency. I don't like playing games where sufficiently good luck overcomes skill.

RNG comes into play more so with games like ascension, where someone buys the right card at the right time and then steamrolls the game because the card is only balanced by a high cost. I don't enjoy games where the strategy seems one dimensional: get a lot of buys and card draws and wait for something to useful to buy."

I don't think it does combat any better or worse than many action games. People love souls games for combat, but a guy beat Sekiro with a [bongos](https://www.geek.com/games/finally-someone-beat-sekiro-with-donkey-kong-bongos-1784339/), so how complex can it be? Most combat games are only interesting to the extent you try new things—the enemies are all variations of basic archetypes, and once you learn how to fight it once, you can fight it a dozen times.

As for the rating, it has story and worldbuilding that hit way harder than most games in this genre. I think it does a way better job than say, the new tomb raider games or uncharted. And the little touches, like stories starting while you row around the lake, that then pause and pick up when you land/cast off, make it feel very real and immersive. It's got some very light metroidvania elements, where you look at a puzzle and can't figure it out, but after you get an upgrade it's trivial. And the characters, especially the interplay between Kratos and boy, are phenomenal.

Personally, I found the combat just nuanced enough to enjoy it thoroughly by changing my playstyle. About the only time it got boring was grinding through the world with the dungeon timers to get currency. That was annoying, but it's also totally optional."

If they got rid of the flying and focused on some better level design I would have been much happier. 

As an aside, I vastly prefer BT to BK, and never realized the larger world held a different opinion until recently. BK is great, but I can beat it in less than a weekend and there is only a single jiggy that requires any back-tracking, so I can basically steamroll the game. BT I actually had to think about how the worlds connect and realize that a puzzle may be too hard simply because I don't have the right abilities yet. 

That said, I appreciate that some abilities in BT were silly (why so many damn egg types), but I'd rather have niche uses for skills than omnibus skills that break the game (flying)."
