Now don't get me wrong, I don't like tipping culture at all. Increase the prices, don't make the consumer do the math. And it's not like they don't make a profit. I work at KFC, not a proper restaurant so take this with a grain of salt, but the profit margin for potato and gravy is over 90%. So they sell it at almost double the manufacturing costs. (Also Australia, we don't have tipping culture, so take it with more grains of salt)

It's just something created by restaurants to make their prices seem lower."

eu4,ff2n0pa,t1_ff2h62r,1579514119.0,"I did a bit of research, and the French apparently sent about 5 million Livres over the war. Then I put it through a Livres>Pounds calculator, which put it at 375,000£. Which doesn't sound like much, but that doesn't take inflation into account. However the calculator didn't have a definitive date for when this calculation is accurate, so I had two dates to calculate from, 1702, when the site said the Livres was pinned, and 1776, the start of the American Revolution. Inflation is going to be insane given between a bit under 2 and half centuries, to over 3 centuries.

Using the site in2013dollars.com I set the date first to 1776, which came out to £61,861,052. 

And then I went to do 1702. But shit, this site doesn't have before 1750, ""wow, that's gay"" I thought, so I went to a different site, and will now do both calculations here, on uwyo.edu which claims to be able to go back to 1264. Epic. Annoyingly it converts direct to USD, giving no room to see modern pounds, but whatever, I was gonna convert it to AUD and USD anyway (I live in Australia) so I'll just replace USD with GBP

After doing these calcs, one of these sites are wrong. I choose to believe the second, as it is a university website

1776: $65,291,386.45 (AUD: $95,031,612.98   GBP: £50,344,555.81)
1702: $89,511,056.70 (AUD: $130,283,343.03 GBP: £69,019,738.05)
God the Australian dollar is shit.

Still not very much in national scales. The 1702 estimate is 14.5x less than the Fish and Wildlife Service gets yearly.

So now I wanted to find the GDP of America in 1776. There was nothing, absolutely nothing on this subject. So, even though I know it's not gonna be very accurate, considering the massive border and population growth in the 1800s and early 1900s, I'll take what seems to be the average growth of the US GDP and go backwards. Since 1961 the average GDP growth has been around 2% or so, so I'll use a compounding interest formula to go backwards. 243 years between 2019 and 1776, and current GDP of 19.39 trillion.

I think and hope I did it right, please correct me if I'm wrong

19,390,000,000,000(1-0.02)^243

This comes to a total of 143,058,676,329.06

That is a couple times less than the American military budget, and around a hundred times more than the Fish and Wildlife Service budget. And about 1.5 thousand times more than the aid France sent. So according to my calculations, Frances aid was around 0.73% of this early America's GDP. I'm willing to multiply that by ten, to reflect the immigration and Destiny Manifesting, to 7.3%, but that's still fuck all.

TL;DR France sent the equivalent of 7 bucks to someone who already has a thousand, being charitable, then it's 70. America would have won the revolution even without France, let's be honest. The statue of liberty was a gift from republic to republic, as a reflection of their similar stories and new politics."

Can you tell if someone has obviously mistaken your words with German and so says all the words with German sounds? I know when I dabbled in Dutch I was using my previous experience in German a lot to both guess words and also guess pronunciation.

Also, even here in Australia we also have multiple accents. You can tell if someone comes from Adelaide or Sydney for instance. The major difference is that Adelaidians and South Australians sound way more posh. They use long A's in words like ""dance"" and ""command"" (with the exemption of can(note not the contraction can't, that's always long A in all of Australia), but I think all English accents use a short A) but Sydnians and NSW in general use short A's. There's also a television accent, the accent that tv news presenters and reporters use. It kinda sounds like a mix of the Sydney and South English accent. And finally there's the general ""Bogan"" accent. (I'm not sure how exposed you are to Australian slang, so I took the liberty to google what the Dutch version of it is, and Google says your version is tokkie) 

There's also a Queensland and Western Australian accent, but I don't hear it nearly as much as South Australian and NSW (the NSW accent is also the accent for the ACT, where I live) 

https://youtu.be/9QCgqQdmr0M here is a video of the bogan accent in comparison to the tv accent.

Not just Australia has this btw, England definitely does, the difference between North and South is very pronounced, and America does as well.

With this, after learning about what it means, it's fairly easy to see the relationship. Nos- nose. Noses have a ridge, so you can see that the nose is named after the Old English word for a ridge. Do you have to do that with your surname? Or do you already know what it means straight away?"

TooAfraidToAsk,fe6d2mp,t1_fe379xt,1578887384.0,"However the most vocal and powerful area of feminist thought, Intersectionality, definitely does. Intersectionality is predicated on these four core beliefs

A: Power is not held individually. Power is held in the entire [group]. e.g. Racial, gender, sexual orientation, cisgender or transgender, gender identity etc. By being a part of the Power Group, and not the Oppressed Group, you inherit that power.

B: Power is cumulative. Someone with racial power, and gender power, and sexual orientation power, and cis/trans power, and gender identity power, has maximum possible power.

C: Prejudice is not held individually. Prejudice, just like Power, is seperated into the different groups, and you inherit prejudice through these groups. They also redefine what Prejudice means. It isn't thinking all people of a race are evil, it is the entire system. If more people of a race are in prison, that is prejudice, and those that are not that group, are inherently part of the Prejudice group

D: Racism/Sexism/[X]-ism is Power + Prejudice

Therefore, only someone that is both part of a Power Group, and a Prejudice group, can be [X]-ist.
If you are part of a racial power group, and a racial prejudice group, you are inherently racist, according to intersectional theory. Almost always, a Power Group and a Prejudice Group coincide. 

In western society, White is the racial Power Group, and racial Prejudice Group. Cultural appropriation, in their mind, is a form of racism. Because black is one of the Oppression Groups, they cannot be racist. Intersectionalists believe black people are physically incapable of racism."
