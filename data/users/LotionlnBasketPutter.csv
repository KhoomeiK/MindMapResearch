news,fehlvjj,t1_feh78zv,1579119189.0,But wouldn't it be so much better if that wasn't necessary?

AskReddit,fdxsxht,t1_fdxqttt,1578772554.0,... Shit.

gadgets,fdel8z5,t1_fdehcxq,1578341407.0,"If it actually works then it would at least make the Bluetooth keyboard for tablets obsolete. It's not a revolution, but it's something."
europe,fcr7pkf,t1_fcr1375,1577897991.0,That's pretty spot on for Russia right now.
worldnews,fcoomk9,t1_fcon9eg,1577837490.0,"It's not even that we hide it better, we just sort of tell ourselves that it's not that big a deal, because we are the good guys now."
worldnews,fcoha5l,t1_fcod244,1577832200.0,For sure. But it's easier to see from the outside than from the inside.

todayilearned,fcgnjby,t1_fcgg5gm,1577642078.0,"That sounds cool. This one is one of several I bought around Tulum, Bacalar and I think even Playa Del Carmen. Some of them are brands with wide distribution I think, but the most interesting ones (like this one) is definitely local. They vary a lot in spicyness too."
todayilearned,fcgfycz,t1_fcg2azo,1577639561.0,"Actually the 25th is more important in Denmark too, we're just heathen assholes who care more about the food and the presents and stuff more than a holy day of worship. Everything is closed on Dec 25 but not on Dec 24 (although some shops etc are)."
todayilearned,fcgerbq,t1_fcgbiyq,1577639245.0,I realize that. I don't have a good answer. Maybe it's slang?
todayilearned,fcfnb6r,t1_fcfm585,1577631947.0,"I doubt it. It does say that it contains unspecified fruits and vegetables, so possibly."
todayilearned,fcey4dv,t1_fcerwc7,1577624818.0,"Depends on how you define 'indigenous', but I wouldn't really say so. They came before the inuit, but disappeared again. Anyway, the point is moot, because the Danes colonized Greenland at a point in time when the local population was inuit, and the abuse was done by Danes under the responsibility of the Danish state against inuit people, whether we call them native or not."

todayilearned,fcd8795,t1_fcd56g6,1577607569.0,What? The American president got elected on a promise to build a wall between Spanish and English America. It's not like the issue wasn't contentious before.
todayilearned,fcd7fh8,t1_fcd2utt,1577607291.0,"I have a bottle of chili sauce from Yucatan with Spanish translations of dirty Mayan words and phrases. It's really weird, but the sauce is good, and now I know how to call someone's mother a dog in Mayan."
todayilearned,fcd6yky,t1_fcd3u7x,1577607128.0,This sounds a lot like Denmark and native people on/from Greenland. Our prime minister just recently publicly apologized for how native Greenlanders were treated in boarding schools up until the 80's or something like that.
