Art supplies are not cheap. At all. Especially professional grade. 
And 15 hours is still a lot of time. Artists don’t work hourly. They work on a commission basis: the more commissions they do, the more money they can make. OP specifically said this was a clients request. This event is also unfair to the client. Plus, That’s 15 more hours of work that shouldn’t have had to happen. It sets OP back.

AmItheAsshole,fdr4hzd,t3_emuj8j,1578679337.0,YTA. Help her learn how to use instacart. Ankles take a while to heal. An hour out of your day for you mom would mean the world to her.
AmItheAsshole,fdr3xfq,t3_emu4yp,1578679189.0,NTA. Wonder if she works in surgery lol.
AmItheAsshole,fdr3co2,t3_emugrx,1578678903.0,"So you’re telling me that you crashed into a BRICK sign and for three hours, nobody called the police to tell them that “hey, this car crashed into a brick sign.”
Because that’s kind of a hard thing to not notice."
AmItheAsshole,fdr2d9n,t3_emtfyi,1578678551.0,"YTA big time. But you can change that.

I get your intentions but frankly you don’t know that kids situation. When I was in high school, I struggled with depression and family issues and did poorly. Pretty much got the barely passing mark for STEM related classes. A couple years later and I’m back on my feet and a premed student working as a surgical technologist with a brighter future than I thought I’d ever have.

Find out why he isn’t doing good. There is a root problem; it’s not that he’s just “bad at math.” He has an interest in these fields; his desire to learn is there.

He has the passion and the want. Encourage him and help him. That is YOUR JOB as a teacher. Give him the precious gift of knowledge and help him out. All you’re going to do is make the poor kid more insecure and unsure about his future.

I had one teacher who sat down with me and did his best to help me despite my shortcomings. If it weren’t for him, I don’t think I could have my dream of working in a hospital and with some aspect of medicine.

And since he’s an American, there’s a lot of routes to take in school to retake prerequisites in a community college and then apply those credits to a uni. Takes longer, but it works."
AmItheAsshole,fdr13bs,t1_fdqzixa,1578678019.0,"No problem. I don’t necessarily think you’re the asshole, you just need to find a safer method. Can’t fault you for wanting to be safe. Giving yourself a “disability” can indicate to these people that you’re easier to take advantage of even if it’s not the case. 
If you’re in America go to the police station and explain your situation. They can increase patrol in those areas for a bit if this is something that happens a lot. That way, if anything ever happens, hopefully a police officer can be nearby. It’s happened in my small city in a certain part of town where many women were unfortunately harassed, so I’m hoping other stations are as understanding.

The grabbing just makes me worry for you. If you’re in America, why not carry pepper spray or something? (I don’t know if other countries allow pepper spray). Because that’s clearly unwanted harassment and you have a right to protect yourself with nonlethal means."
AmItheAsshole,fdqzfi5,t3_emtsuc,1578677349.0,"Forget the judgement. This can be dangerous for you. If these people think it’s okay to grab on you and everything; if they think you’re deaf they could sneak up behind you and try to knock you out or something. ESPECIALLY when you say you’re 15. Even if you don’t look like it, you’re putting yourselves in harms way by doing that. And even if you’re not deaf, do you really want to possibly put yourself in a situation where you could be grabbed from behind?
I’m not blaming you at all for what is happening to you. These people shouldn’t be doing it to you. But you need to be smart and protect yourself any way you can. If they’re grabbing on you, call the police. Distance yourself. If there are other people around, especially a group of women, go to them and explain the situation if you’re being grabbed on. Any decent human being would understand and help out.

EDIT: OP, NTA. 
And whoever gave me the gold, thank you very much!"

WTF,fdpbhw2,t1_fdol353,1578624485.0,Uh.. what? I always go to the floor. Weirdo.
FansHansenvsPredator,fdpab0y,t1_fdl2k88,1578623679.0,Thank you so much! Didn’t even know they had that on their website.
StarKid,fdpa8ex,t1_fdmxpb9,1578623630.0,Lmao yes. I’m going to make a hat and buy a stuffed duck. I tried finding the exact duck they used but it was probably handmade. Or I just suck at finding things. I’m new to Starkid and theatre in general so I don’t know how many props they make by themselves.
StarKid,fdmev5e,t3_ej2m60,1578547595.0,"So when Chorn gave Ducker knowledge, he DID see the temple for worship of the almighty duck.. and we have been laughing at him this whole time.."
StarKid,fdmefdh,t3_eluruv,1578547203.0,Honestly I would totally dress as Ducker for Halloween.
FansHansenvsPredator,fdl0091,t1_fdkkux2,1578514625.0,"I agree with you. Maybe he’s also trying to be cocky to scare them off from doing it again?
Also,, I figured they wouldn’t have a 100% conviction rate. Did someone do the research on that? Is there a post on here? Not doubting you. I’m just curious as to who actually got convicted in the 10%"
trashy,fdaiz4a,t1_fda4whn,1578246582.0,"I don’t know for sure but in America I think you still do. Which begs the question, where do they get the money?"
AmItheAsshole,fd71hgc,t1_fd6zq8q,1578198285.0,"Thanks for sharing this story. You’re absolutely right, thoughts are gone seconds later. For some reason I just think people talk about my screw ups all the time. I’m going to keep this story with me in mind to remind me. Thank you."
