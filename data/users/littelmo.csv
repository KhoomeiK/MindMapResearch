nextfuckinglevel,ffccokp,t1_ffbp6gq,1579796599.0,"I just watched a fascinating documentary on Christiano Rinaldo, that looked to prove the genetics theory. Put him up against another guy for all the run of the mill sprinting and agility tests. Of course, Rinaldo blew him out of the water. He is a superior athlete.

But then they did eye gaze assessment for a simple ball handling and that was the gold. The % of time Rinaldo actually looked At the ball? Minimal. He looked at the defender's hips and knees to determine angular velocity. He looked past the defender. He looked at the goal. Only infrequently would he look at the ball he was  moving with his own feet.

Another test was also fascinating. The ball was lobbed to him, and the lights were immediately turned off, to total dark. He had to infer speed, angle and location to score. He nailed every. Single. Time.

That is a person who has more than top talent."
NoStupidQuestions,ffc53pk,t3_esryk4,1579791731.0,"I'll add to the prior comment: just because there is a window doesn't mean you could see anything. With an Oven, you have to turn on a light to have adequate illumination to see the interior of what is essentially a dark box. So now you need water-safe lighting. Now, hot water turns into steam, and that window will almost certainly fog over right-quick. It's not like a dry oven. So, there would need to be a coating or other measures in place so you could actually see through it as intended. So, this ""simple"" window would cost thousands."

bipolar,fef5c97,t1_feed5gq,1579048544.0,"Well... To be fair, that line of thinking does have a grain of truth. For most people with chronic, severe disease, it is truly like diabetes and high blood pressure. You can ignore it, and not medicate or medicate with complementary medicines, but the disease will still be present. For the majority of people, it is true that medications are needed to stay on the path to be healthy and productive."

careerguidance,febt9x5,t3_eoctpw,1578962436.0,"Yes, I don't think there are many specific job opportunities with Exercise Science. It's typically a springboard major for PT, OT or other programs. Personal trainers and health fitness coaches would also be career jobs, but the life would be rough. Job stability is rare, income potential is not high and usually based upon commissions. Cardiac and Pulmonary rehab are also possible but more specific certifications are required.

There are a lot of possible options out there. What are exercise science in particular are you interested by?"

AskDocs,fdxl5hl,t1_fdx0dse,1578770091.0,"I'm going to give this a ""yes, but."" There's only so much available to a healthy person after a routine surgery. Home care nursing is only available to homebound people, and there are strict criteria for that. Private duty aides are always available, but those are at an out of pocket cost, not covered by insurance. At most, a home health nurse could come once, maybe twice, but, again, ongoing care has to fall under need and criteria. And there really wouldn't be much to do. Pain management will be managed by the primary surgery team, and there aren't specific dressings to be done. - source: acute care hospital nurse case manager."

Then I remember I'm 40, a single mom with a mortgage, and it all gets really weird in my head. You wanna really go on a mind trip? Start looking at old movies, and realize how old those characters, and especially the actors were. Age is something we assign great meaning to. Turn 16 and drive! Turn 21 and drink! Graduate college!

careerguidance,fczr2fg,t3_ejkee7,1578107164.0,"Here's a bit of tough love. Depression and anxiety are liars. They lie every day that you aren't good enough, that you aren't smart enough, and dammit people hate you! Here's the thing, it does, and CAN, get better. But, you gotta get there first. And, that means you gotta figure out what lies depression and anxiety are telling you. Now, quitting life and your job sounds like a great fix, right? But what does that fix? Do you have a bank roll? I'm serious. Quitting a job means now you need to find another one, (stressful), you'll have no health insurance for psych or meds ( but you need them), and worry about bills and literally a roof over ypur head can be panic attack level. Quitting a job doesn't solve the problem, addressing the problem fixed the problem. Working on *you* works on the issue. This is not the answer you'll get from everyone, but I stand by it. - source: bipolar depression, 40yo, successful in my career, and work in Healthcare helping others going through it too."
