1. It's way too expensive for what you get in return. For the same amount that I pay rent for an ok 2 bed apartment 9km from the city, I could get a luxury 2 bed apartment 2km from the city in Brisbane.

2. The people are nowhere near as friendly and outgoing as they are in Brisbane. This is purely anecdotal but they seem more busy and cold than relaxed and warm.

3. It's crowded as hell and quite dirty in certain areas

4. I'll never be able to afford a house here, even on a decent income. There's no use for me to be emotionally invested in the city if I know I'll have to leave anyway.

United States
>In November 1991, The United States Congress enacted a luxury tax and was signed by President George H.W. Bush. The goal of the tax was to generate additional revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit. This tax was levied on material goods such as watches, expensive furs, boats, yachts, private jet planes, jewelry and expensive cars. Congress enacted a 10 percent luxury surcharge tax on boats over $100,000, cars over $30,000, aircraft over $250,000, and furs and jewelry over $10,000. The federal government estimated that it would raise $9 billion in excess revenues over the following five-year period. However, only two years after its imposition, in August 1993, at the behest of the luxury yacht industry, President Bill Clinton and Congress eliminated the “luxury tax” citing a loss in jobs.[5]The luxury automobile tax remained in effect until 2002.

Bulgaria
>A luxury tax of 10% on boats over $300,000 and aircraft over $1 million was proposed in 2010 by finance minister Simeon Djankov. Parliament approved the tax for a temporary 3-year period

Luxury car tax in Australia
>The Luxury Car Tax (LCT) is a tax within the Australian taxation system, collected by the Australian Taxation Office on behalf of the Australian Government. It began on 1 July 2001, having been brought in by the John Howard Coalition government.

>LCT is payable by businesses which sell or import luxury cars. LCT is charged in addition to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), but it is not payable on the full price of the vehicle. LCT is only payable at the rate of 33% of the value of the GST-inclusive value which exceeds the LCT threshold. The LCT threshold is currently $67,525.00 AUD (for the 2019-20 financial year). An increased threshold of $75,526.00 AUD applies to fuel efficient cars.

There's a difference between a value added tax/goods and services tax (VAT or GST) and a luxury tax. And with specific regards to the thing we were actually talking about (which hasn't even been implemented yet you fucking idiot), Yang could very easily not impose taxes on things that normal people typically purchase. It's not that hard in theory and it's been done before in plenty of other places."
