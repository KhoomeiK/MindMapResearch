ayearofmiddlemarch,ff466ig,t1_ff3qxl1,1579556409.0,"The novel was written in 1869 and first published in 1871. I wonder if Eliot set it during the 1830s to express what life pre-reform was like. Or at least if it was one factor for her setting it in pre-reform times. 
  
I took the quotation that made you suspicious of Causabon (""She was not in the least teaching Mr. Casaubon to ask if he were good enough for her, but merely asking herself anxiously how she could be good enough for Mr. Casaubon."") in a completely different way. I put it with the statements a couple of sentences above that describe Dorothy as having ‚Äúthe charms of a nature which was entirely without hidden calculations either for immediate effects or for remoter ends. It was this which made Dorothea so childlike, and, according to some judges, so stupid, with all her reputed cleverness.‚Äù Causabon is being ""unconsciously wrought upon"" by Dorothy who possesses this type of nature. It's hard not to respond positively to guilelessness. Innocence is one of the things that makes life doable (for me at least). But that kind of nature isn't the norm. Usually we are not passive but quite active and even manipulative in trying to get our way when dating, right? We are always trying to get people to see that we're worth something and that they should be on their toes, always asking if they are good enough for us, not if we are good enough for them. It's a game (that I try not to play but for sure have played). Anyway, I think the narrator was being ironic when she pointed out Dorothy's lack of wiles in the dating game in a way that made that lack seem problematic. 
  
And I must be the only one who likes Dorothy better than Cecilia, and that was even before this week's installment in which Cecilia proves herself to be pretty superficial and cruel."
ayearofmiddlemarch,ff43x78,t3_erh5wg,1579554995.0,"These chapters are more of Cecilia vs Dorothy, and there's a marriage proposal and its acceptances in there as well. I still like Dorothy a whole lot more than Cecilia.  Dorothy has a vision, though it's a bit misguided. Cecelia won't argue with others and ""always said just how things were, and nothing else.‚Äù Well, that's nice and all, but she sure gripes about Dorothy's way of dealing with life as much or more than Dorothy dismisses Cecilia as having the mind of a squirrel or cat. According to Cecilia, Dorothy never looks just where she is and so makes the mistake of ""treading in the wrong place."" Cecilia goes on, ""You always see what nobody else sees; it is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what is quite plain. That‚Äôs your way, Dodo.‚Äù Okay that may be true, but it sounds to me like the trope of dismissing those people who see things differently and then regard these ""weirdos"" a couple decades later as visionaries.  Furthermore, for all--as the narrator puts it--Cecilia's ‚Äúmarvellous quickness in observing a certain order of signs generally preparing her to expect such outward events as she had an interest in,‚Äù she was taken by total surprise by Dorothy's engagement to Causabon. So her clear-eyed practicality is not so accurate after all. And she's pretty cruel to boot. Dorothy is exacting and exhausting to be around for most people for sure, but she has ""the charms of a nature which was entirely without hidden calculations either for immediate effects or for remoter ends."" She is pretty open about what she wants and how she is going about trying to make it happen. Ya gotta love someone who is so transparent and so high-minded. And yeah she may be trying to achieve her grandiose vision of life in an imperfect way, by Causabon's help and support, or by building cottages, or by willy nilly renouncing this or that, but at least she has a vision and is going for it. She just does it, like Nike lol. Imagine the restrictiveness of a society full of Cecelias. We need all the Dorothys we can get in the world."

ayearofmiddlemarch,feabiq3,t3_eo762k,1578946650.0,"I still find myself wondering about the tone of the narrator toward women. I haven't googled if this is considered to be one of the first feminist novels or something of that nature. If so, the feminist tone is sooooo subtle and almost hidden under a whatever, it is what it is & some women really are a tad ridiculous anyway kind of drily humorous tone (in my opinion). I am thinking maybe it had to be this way because of the times it was published in. And to be fair the narrator's tone towards some men is that they're ridiculous too.
  
I really like the part in Chapter 3 where Dorothea is acknowledging her interest in Casaubon has, in large part, to do with how she would increase her knowledge and understanding as a result of the union because it made me think. In that time, it was maybe one of very few ways a woman could become more knowledgeable--and a very unusual and maybe unheard of way at that. (There was the whole Chloe/Strephon, Pippin/Pumpkin analogies given by the narrator to show just how very strange Dorothea's reasons for falling in love with Casaubon were.) However, to me it is very natural to think how being with another person will develop me. Maybe it's because the stay at home and raise kids in a house with a white picket fence while my husband brought home the money vision was never available to me (cuz I'm an elder gay), so I was never thinking I wanted to sit home have babies and be immersed in plate and curtain patterns or whatever. So I think Dorothea is super on point in her thinking and I'm not at all thinking, wow, she is really so very different from the rest of us women. And I'm wondering if the narrator is thinking women during that time period would find Dorothea's reasonings odd to the sky and back or a sneaky means to and end or what. I just find them legit and sound. Or....maybe the narrator's trying to show using subtle, subtle irony that Dorothea's way of looking at mate potential is better than the way it's normally done?"

ArtefactPorn,fdl5cx4,t3_ely1bz,1578517318.0,"Okay I needed a refresher on this and maybe someone else does too. From Wikipedia: 

A death mask is a likeness (typically in wax or plaster cast) of a person's face after their death, usually made by taking a cast or impression from the corpse. Death masks may be mementos of the dead, or be used for creation of portraits. It is sometimes possible to identify portraits that have been painted from death masks, because of the characteristic slight distortions of the features caused by the weight of the plaster during the making of the mold.

The main purpose of the death mask from the Middle Ages until the 19th century was to serve as a model for sculptors in creating statues and busts of the deceased person. Not until the 1800s did such masks become valued for themselves.[1]

In other cultures a death mask may be a funeral mask, an image placed on the face of the deceased before burial rites, and normally buried with them. The best known of these are the masks used in ancient Egypt as part of the mummification process, such as Tutankhamun's mask, and those from Mycenaean Greece such as the Mask of Agamemnon.

In some European countries, it was common for death masks to be used as part of the effigy of the deceased, displayed at state funerals; the coffin portrait was an alternative. Mourning portraits were also painted, showing the subject lying in repose. During the 18th and 19th centuries masks were also used to permanently record the features of unknown corpses for purposes of identification. This function was later replaced by post-mortem photography.

In the cases of people whose faces were damaged by their death, it was common to take casts of their hands. An example of this occurred in the case of Thomas D'Arcy McGee, the Canadian statesman whose face was shattered by the bullet which was used to assassinate him in 1868.[citation needed]

When taken from a living subject, such a cast is called a life mask. Proponents of phrenology used both death masks and life masks for pseudoscientific purposes."

ayearofmiddlemarch,fdl0un5,t3_ekua1f,1578515072.0,"The tone of the Prelude surprised me a little in its objectiveness. It kind of went like this for me: Welp, these days, there are awesome women born here and there, just like there have been in the past, present, and future, but the difference is that today they have no proper pathway to reach self-realization as there has been in the past, so there are lots of women ‚Äúwhose loving heartbeats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed among hindrances."" (I feel like this--and the Prelude in general--is kinda ""Oh well."" Is it just me?)
  
Actually, it's not only the detached tone but the very slightly condescending way the narrator--in the Prelude--views most women. I really feel we would never have this tone, even in a novel rather than nonfiction, paired with this subject matter in 2020. Very un-politically correct. The style today would be to be straightforward and uber emphatic about what a tragedy it is that this situation is happening and we need to take immediate steps to correct it and so on.
  
I'm so glad there was so much humor in Chapter One. Makes me want to continue reading. I like Dorothea, but I'm an all or nothing type of person, so maybe I find comfort in other people who also find it difficult to walk the middle line, lol.
  
Favorite lines: ‚ÄúShall you wear them in company?‚Äù said Celia, who was watching her with real curiosity as to what she would do.
Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative adornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen discernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward fire.

Poetry,fcki05h,t1_fci8k67,1577725764.0,"I don't see what's so fabulous about Eliot's Wasteland. Most of Eileen Myles' poems elicit nothing from me but wonder about why she's so revered. I stopped railing against what the establishment said was and was not good poetry and just enjoyed the hell out of the poems that moved me. Except, yeah, there is always that one part of me silently to myself agreeing or disagreeing with the establishment or wondering why a certain poet is ignored by the establishment or wondering what the hell is wrong with me that I don't see what the fuss is about Eliot or Myles. Don't know if I can ever eliminate that agree/disagree/why isn't this person recognized?/what is wrong with me that I don't see it? judgment thingy I do. How to silence that inner critic?"
ayearofmiddlemarch,fckfrtn,t3_egvvr5,1577724342.0,What's and where can I get the best free Kindle edition?
hiking,fc5y4s7,t3_egdz7a,1577468308.0,Where is this? I need to see this type of scenery in real life regularly. Quality of life bump by an order of magnitude.

suggestmeabook,fc42lpa,t1_fc3rley,1577404986.0,I just read *Someone Who Will Love You in All Your Damaged Glory* and found it darkly humorous and relatable.
suggestmeabook,fc3qfrd,t3_eg17tg,1577396042.0,"Short stories. Poems. For me these two have the best ratio for feels to effort. (Don't know about you, but effort is in short supply when I'm feeling low low low.)"
books,fc3m2sj,t3_eg0bvy,1577392932.0,"Honestly don't think this is very clear. Know it's a famous book and all, but that's my two cents. Paraphrase: We can all learn to see things in a humorous light, even when in horrendous situations. Also, we all feel suffering completely, so talking about its size isn't very helpful."
pitbulls,fc1zqns,t3_efqrjt,1577334915.0,Oh Jenny.
vegan,fc1zp6g,t3_efqtcm,1577334875.0,Looks like poo.
dogs,fc1xe3j,t3_efqdlo,1577332666.0,I am very sorry for your loss. Your post touched me. Thank you for sharing.
pitbulls,fc1p890,t1_fc1ohsy,1577325373.0,I'm wondering if it'll last until New Years.
books,fc1oyfg,t3_efp0zp,1577325128.0,"Sounds a little similar what I was trying to find years ago. Mine had fairytales and one of the stories was ""Puss in Boots."" Magical, magical book. I'm kinda glad I never figured it out. Be careful what you wish for."
