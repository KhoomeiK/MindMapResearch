After a while oil from cooking and what not would cover the stuff on the shelf and then eventually dust would collect onto the oily decorations. It was gunky, sticky and kind of hard to clean off. Every few weeks I would have to do a deep clean of that shelf and everything on it."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fc4nso9,t1_fc4mmm2,1577422230.0,"Maybe they thought they were getting you something more valuable? 
The older jersey wasn't being sold everywhere, so they thought it was/might turn out to be a collectors item or worth a lot?

IMO getting a different version of something you wanted is better than getting nothing or something completely different. They still listened to you and got a jersey, of the player that you wanted.

Parents are obligated to give their children food and a roof over their heads, not give them presents.
A lot of kids can't even say their parents fed them and gave them a place to sleep.
As someone who didn't have a great childhood, I find it odd that people complain about how their parents are spending money on presents for them."
