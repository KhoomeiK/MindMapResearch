todayilearned,fed7qfm,t1_fed6vwr,1579002761.0,"Basically all the money from the crown estate (rents from the massive portfolio of land the crown owns) gets handed over to the government.
The government then hands back a percentage of those rents to the royal family as its “budget” or “expenses”.

Google the “sovereign grant” for more info on this and how the monarchy is funded."

I was arguing with a guy who was insistent that there was nothing wrong with traveling 110 mph on a motorway, he then called me “another steering attendant” because I claimed that 110mph would have a severe effect on his stopping time and response time."

“NHS orthodontic care is not usually available for adults, but may be approved on a case-by-case basis if needed for health reasons.”

I think the most cosmetic thing I’ve had done was getting a tooth removed when I was a kid as my mouth was overcrowded.
They wanted it gone to prevent me needing braces later in life."
