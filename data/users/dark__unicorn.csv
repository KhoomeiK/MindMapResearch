However, whenever people worry about unvaccinated kids I would always ask - what happens if on the day of the party one of your kids has the runs? Would you call and cancel out if a courtesy for your guests? Because the chances that every kid at the party comes down with gastro is super high."
ScienceParents,ffbkg91,t1_ffb8zxg,1579769581.0,"This is probably the best advice here. Also would you say no to someone who is allergic and can’t have the vaccine? 

It’s also important to note that many of the things you are vaccinated for are rare. Largely due to vaccination rates. Even so, if there is a measles outbreak, or whooping cough is going around, it’s likely that you’re doctor will know. If OP asks them, they’ll know if there’s something specific to be worried about and also have background information that they can approach their friends with. Like - ‘hey, apparently there have been a few cases of whooping cough going around. You’re kids have had their vaccine right? Just in case someone has it and doesn’t know, and comes to the party.’ 

In saying all this... kids parties are breeding grounds for viruses and bacteria. I would bet my house that the kids are all gonna get sick from something anyway."

If my fully trained five year old has tummy issues, I’ll have no hesitation in putting a pull-up on. I know many parents prefer cold turkey... but if there’s a chance she has the runs and might poop herself, I’d rather she did it in a nappy, than in her underwear.

toddlers,ff4m2k9,t1_ff3e633,1579566900.0,"The other thing I felt this method missed is bladder capacity. At two most kids are still going dozens of times a day.

The benefit of waiting was that there was no stress for me, no stress for them, and best of all - no accidents. I still let the 3yo poop in a nappy if she needs and we do pull-ups at night.

relationship_advice,ff3sbpx,t1_ff3liiq,1579547786.0,"See I don’t buy into this rationale at all. A couple should always put each other first. But once they split up, it’s done. The children have to come first in every scenario, from that point to eternity. They need to be considered in every future decision their parents make and need to come before other potential romantic partners. 

If a parent can’t be happy alone, with their kids, then they’ll never be happy. Similarly, a child not accepting a relationship that their parent is in, is completely valid.

These day’s whenever a child doesn’t want their parent to remarry, or to have more kids with a new partner, the advise is always - seek therapy. We need to reprogram them in to thinking and accepting what we, as adults - want. But no. They don’t need to change how they feel. Their feelings have merit and what they want should hold more weight than what any potential romantic partner, and even their parents, want."

I will say though, I have had two friends that took a ‘break’ in their respective honeymoon periods and went on to have longterm relationships. Both ended miserably - one a couple of weeks before the wedding. If someone is having doubts during the easiest part of the relationship, you can be sure those doubts won’t go away.

It doesn’t matter what your feelings about the situation are. Kids with parents who are willing to look out for them - you know, with a strong family support structure - are always going to do better than those without.

So I don’t know why western culture keeps pushing this narrative. That people need to move away from their parents as soon as they turn 18, that once you’re married you don’t need to see immediate family or relatives anymore, that it’s expected to hate your in-laws, that grandparents should be put in homes rather than cared for.

The other side to this is that she’ll be grateful to her parents and less likely to develop resentment toward them."
unpopularopinion,femg5d8,t1_felzbcu,1579253769.0,"To be honest, I think the bragging and putting down of people who live with their parents, is more of a coping mechanism. The reality is, people with close knit families don’t really care if someone criticizes them for it. Why would they? - they have a rock solid support system. But, as soon as you question someone for living out of home, they are often defensive and deflect by calling anyone else who still does a loser/immature/irresponsible. Well, that’s been my experience anyway."
unpopularopinion,femfxqm,t3_epry71,1579253448.0,"Depending on where you live, living out of home can be super expensive. Where I live, most teens and 20 year olds view people living out of home as irresponsible. I know that goes against what pop culture has tried to force us to believe. But unless they’re living in a home they own, it’s actually viewed as immature and delaying real financial responsibility. It’s more favourable to live at home and save enough money for a house, than to end up in your late twenties and thirties still renting. 

So I’d say it really depends on where you live and what your views are regarding financial responsibility.

Yes, if a woman can decide she doesn’t want to raise a child, the father should have the same right. If he doesn’t want a child, he should be able to opt out. Similarly, if a father finds out a child might not be his, following a DNA test, he should also be able to opt out, if thats what he wants. 

At the moment the conversation is heavily focused from the woman’s perspective. But it will change. That’s why I believe we need to be more rational and equal about it. Because I feel like there will be some sort of societal retaliatory shift in the future, if this doesn’t happen. 

Everyday we get closer and closer to a male contraceptive. Once this happens, partners will start to distrust each other, should they fall pregnant. And others will distrust each other when they’re not falling pregnant - like why aren’t we pregnant yet? Maybe he’s taking the pill secretly?"

We had a similar situation. The day we moved into a new place we received a phone call from security telling us to keep the noise down - that they had received several complaints about us. We told them we weren’t sure what they were talking about, but ‘ok.’ This happened a couple of times till security came knocking on our door. Husband answers, and the security guard tells us that he’ll need to report us. My husband politely tells him to take a look inside our apartment and tell us what exactly the problem is, so that we can fix it. We were alone, sitting in a dimly lit living room, me eight months pregnant, watching tv.

The kids are crying out for their parents to do something with them, but they won’t. They just work, feed them, buy them lots of toys and pay for a good school. But other than that, nothing. The thing is, there’s no reason for them to be working so much - they’re doing well financially. For 12 hours of the day their mother is at work. When she gets home, she just feeds them. As a result they’re both overweight. Not obese, but still too big. It’s like she’s substituting time with food. 

I take my kids to activities and their cousins are jealous when they talk about it. Constantly saying I wish we could go. But, I’ve had it. It’s not my responsibility and I’m not taking them. I try to encourage their parents to take time out from work at take them to soccer, ballet, whatever - but it falls on deaf ears. So I have given up. It hurts me to see the kids like that, but I can’t bear that emotional burden so I find myself dismissing them now too. I just don’t want to hear it... just tell your parents kids. 

The parents claim everything is ok though. They don’t see an issue. 

The worst thing about this situation, is the lack of parental engagement has made at least one of the children unbearable. She has no discipline and is a bad influence on my children. She’s also incredibly annoying. Now, I hate talking about a child like that, but it’s not her fault. Her parents have helped shape her personality and she’s just not a likeable kid.

If you want things to change, you have to change your house rules and you need to be consistent about it. You need to set up the boundaries. But, be aware, this will be hard to do because you’ve already established an accepted type of behaviour, and suddenly everyone will be receiving a different message. 

I’d suggest moving the snacks and all the food everyine likes to eat. Make sure they don’t know where they are. Offer substitutes, like fruit.

But since then, the number of babies being born each year has actually been increasing. However, at the same time, the number of childfree women (couples) has also been increasing. 

The issue then becomes very complex and honestly, we need more info. For example, are childfree couples investing heavily in their retirement, or are they spending up and enjoying life? Conversely, are parents more likely to plan for the future because they have children? 

Then the issue becomes, who will bear the burden of older generations? We often call parents selfish if their children care for them in old age. However, it’s infinitely more selfish to expect someone else’s children and future generations to bear the costs of looking after you in old age.

The reality is, not many of the people who remain childless are going to be financially self-sufficient, or self-funded in retirement. Who then should be burdened with their care?"
TwoXChromosomes,fdvl20x,t3_emzkfo,1578748515.0,"Living in Australia, and just based on what I have observed, I think that a lot of it has to do with support structures. 

Most of my family and social connections are based around my cultural heritage. This heritage has a heavy focus on family and togetherness. Meaning that everyone has a lot of support. Family are always happy to help and close friends are viewed as extended family. But this help doesn’t just centre around bringing up kids - it’s also about financial support. Families and siblings work together to make money, they don’t compete with each other. As a result, they tend to be wealthier. So, when there’s talk of growing childfree couples, it’s definitely not within my cultural ethnic demographic. In fact, most of the families I know are having 3+ children. 

In contrast, when I look at my friends and colleagues from work and school - generally very ‘white’ Australian, I’d say - they don’t have those support structures. They don’t engage with or value family. They rely on government childcare, and consequently limit the amount of children they have. Financially, their lives are about competition, and the idea of investing with a family member is absurd to them. Most rent, despite having fairly good incomes, which means they have just a little less stability. 

It would be interesting to see real data on who is having all the babies. Because 2018 was a record year for births in Australia."
TwoXChromosomes,fdvh5j2,t1_fdtznoy,1578747394.0,"The article is super misleading and is based on stats from 2000. So it’s difficult to tell. 

But recent statistics in Australia suggest that the volume of babies being born is increasing - with a record number of babies in 2018. But fertility per woman is declining. 

So it seems the trend is that even though there are more couples choosing to remain childless, the women choosing to have children are having more of them."

You might be looking for the negatives and weighing them more significantly because that’s how you feel, not them. 

Most people are going to be realistic. If they need to give up some of their own plans to do something for their parents, they aren’t going to say it’s all roses. They’ll probably say it sucks. But that doesn’t mean they’re miserable, or see their parents as a burden."

Similarly, I have cousins living in the Nordic regions of Europe. They do tend to laugh at us and how we cling to each other and traditions. Often bragging that they have moved on and don’t bother with cousins, only friends.

I think it’s more about not being persistent and reading their cues. 

At the same time, it’s perfectly valid to surround yourself with people who have the same values of yourself.

And sometimes the information isn’t even true. I live in Australia and regularly hear mothers talk about how they don’t like the idea of injecting mercury into their kids. Our children’s vaccines don’t even contain mercury. The composition is slightly different to other parts of the world (not sure why? Different manufacturer maybe?). So the information isn’t even accurate. Yet, they still use this information to instill fear in parents. 

Not that mercury in thimerosal is that big of a deal anyway."
raisingkids,fdlbpf3,t3_eluta0,1578520612.0,"I don’t think encouraging them to fail is necessarily the best course of action. Teaching them coping mechanisms is more appropriate. 

Plus this idea that we need to encourage mistakes, and persistence, even when they’re not good at something is counter productive. Sometimes kids fail, just like adults, because they just aren’t good at something. So, self awareness of their strengths and weaknesses is also important. 

There was a study, if I find it I’ll link it, looking at speed reading. It compared above average readers to slower readers. It found that after intensive tutoring the slow readers improved.

ShitMomGroupsSay,fdl6hb4,t1_fdl5ot6,1578517866.0,"This used to be a thing. Before the vaccine. Parents would expose their kids to chicken pox young, so they would develop an immunity and not develop a severe case in adulthood. Children tend to handle the illness better than adults.

“They never stepped in to help us” - implies you didn’t ask. Otherwise you would have written, ‘we asked and they refused.’ You aren’t entitled to their home, or storage space, regardless of the circumstances. 

Then you again state you actively avoid them. So why would they make an effort. 

You question your MIL for questioning your sons paternity. But by your own admission, you fell pregnant two months into your relationship. It’s completely reasonable for her to be questioning it. That you don’t understand that is a worry. 

As for the younger brothers child... whether or not he is in the mothers custody is irrelevant. But you chose to put this information in your post. Which adds insight into how you view yourself and them.
