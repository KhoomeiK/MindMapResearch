dogswithjobs,fek61vi,t1_fehm8p0,1579193359.0,Dude. A small kids mom died. Dogs are completely acceptable during that. It’s not about giving every kid a “trophy” or what not it’s about making sure they grow up mentally healthy knowing that they have people there for them. Losing a parent at a young age can be absolutely traumatizing for a kid. Giving every kid a trophy would be like doing a competition for a classroom and then ending up giving every single kid a medal. That’s not what they’re doing here

science,fdu2lrh,t3_emtrov,1578726411.0,"My ex had an open, unlocked closet full of guns and rifles... literally it was half of his actual closet. He was a proud member of the NRA and a proud Trump supporter. He sometimes had a crazy look in his eyes and it honestly kinda scared me. There as a reason I broke up with him after only less than 2 months.  After about 5 weeks I had this horrible intuition about him and I no joke felt that an accident would happen if I remained with him...well, 8 months later his new girlfriend and himself got into a fight and by drunken rage he shot her. Fortunately, she lived, but is partially paralyzed for the rest of her life. He is currently serving 15 years in prison... which isn’t nearly enough. 

It’s not cool and people have guns like toys and own them beyond the point of way too freely. That literally could have been me, and I heavily thank god every day that my intuition proved me so right...and that I had the adequate intelligence to follow my gut feelings. I’m glad I listened to my red alarm bells and here forth I refuse to ever be with a man who so solely owns even 1 gun after this whole shindig. Anything else at this point. Take karate classes for fucks sake if you have to defend yourself, anything it takes to not own a gun, let alone a closet full of free open rifles. He used to sleep with his rifle and hit pit bull in the bed. He lived in a perfectly okay middle class area, why tf do you need a rifle in your bed. When I went over, I told him the rifle needed to go I’m not sleeping on top of a fucking hunting rifle. Dog was obviously fine. He used the poor baby to make himself feel more inferior, though. I’ll never forget, the sprinkler guy came one time to fix his sprinklers and he legitimately grabbed his pistol and held it behind his back just in case he “wasn’t actually the sprinkler guy.” I’m not even sure It was a fear thing at this point, but that, it seemed as if it was obsessive masculinity thing. (I’m speaking for only him personally). 

Gun regulation is not alone in itself is no longer a matter of right to protection at this point, not anymore. It’s a matter of whether you want to allow for these weapons to get into the hands of crazy lunatics or not... the wrong people for better words, and without some form of regulated filtered systematics laws, lunatics like my ex, who everyone believed was normal at first, will absolutely continue to have/own open closets full of these weapons, and ruin lives. 

Additionally: Don’t you never forget that our current president supports and funds the NRA. You say it’s not the guns, it’s the people, well then start support lawmakers who actually want to give only mentally equipped people rights to carry guns. If you’re a capable person than you would be fine. If you still don’t agree, then you are not only completely outing yourself but contradicting yourself. 

It’s an extremely serious matter, and your gun loving persona won’t work anymore when innocent people are dying. You can still have your guns if you’re proven a sane person...so I mean, if you’re actually sane, you shouldn’t have to worry about your “guns being taken away.” There are hunting licenses and more you can receive to obtain your rifles, and there would be the same screening tests and regulations with owning regular pistols and guns. A few extra steps won’t kill you if you really want your guns that bad. If you feel different than what I just blatantly wrote down, honestly, get over yourself. You wouldn’t want people driving cars who hadn’t proper qualifications for a drivers license. What blows my mind even more is how the same people who own guns are the ones that tell others they should work for what they have, well...you wouldn’t have a problem with taking a few extra steps for proper screening and licensing then. Work for your prizes, if by so help me god guns are your rewards.

relationship_advice,fcuprj2,t1_fcup4s2,1577986048.0,"I would really give it time. 

I would just honestly give her time to herself after sending that. I think if she hasn’t responded in about 2-3 weeks or so you should message her and ask to talk about what you sent without saying “I love you and want you to be with me” again. I would just say talk to her but tone it down much more next time. Do not message her again until then. That will lower your chances much more. 

If it were me, in about 2-3 weeks I would say, “hey, I’m sorry for dropping that message on you like that. Would you like to talk in person?” 

If she still doesn’t respond in a few weeks after you try to talk again, I would move on. One day you’ll find someone who has reciprocated feelings of it’s not her.

Look. I don’t even know the girl, let alone hate her. My man doesn’t even hate her. Like it’s cool we’re mature. I’m just going off things I heard—which is apparently truth since it’s from people who don’t actually hate her. Lmao she used to make my boyfriend take 200 photos of her every time they went somewhere and when he told her no she would give him silent treatment for hours. She never posted about him and emotionally cheated at the end. That bitch face, whatever it looked like, clearly had some damn hidden secrets. 

Also, my very, very best and closest friend (like a sister to me) has a highly chronic bitch face. Straight to it, she’s an utter complete asshole, but, the nicest kind of female dickhead. She’s always been there for me in my darkest days and in my very best days. Girl always tells me how proud she is of me as a person. She’s may sometimes be a cocky ass bitch in law school, but, she’s smart as hell, and still has that bitch face. Do I love her to death? Completely with all of my heart. Does she have a bitch face with fuckgirl tendencies? 100%. 

Chronic bitch face people are internal assholes 90% of the time. Whether it be a small Asshole, or a gaped Asshole.

3) At the end of the day, it’s not about AirPods or laptops or Chanel bags, it’s about what your partner put thought into and it’s about what your partner will enjoy. 
As a society we have gotten way too caught up I’m materialistic matters. What my boyfriend got me was super special, and the way he treats me year round is wonderful. He was my best present, and I don’t feel as if I could deserve anymore from him because he did give me practical, meaningful things, and he does give me a lot otherwise.

relationship_advice,fc3blbr,t3_efyz1y,1577386181.0,"Some people just don’t have a giving love language but even people who don’t at least go out of there way to do things they know their partner likes. Communication is key. Tell him how this makes you feel. If it doesn’t change, than move on. If you’ve already spoken to him and it hasn’t changed, move on. This is a huge compatibility issue whether you believe it or not. 

My love languages: Gifts, Physical Affection
My boyfriends languages: Physical Affection, The small things, and buying trips/adventures. 

Even though my boyfriend doesn’t give gifts as a love language, he still got me a weighted blanket to help my anxiety, super cozy fuzzy sock slippers bc I love them, and 2 other really small practical things for Christmas. 

What I’m trying to get at here is that it doesn’t matter if it’s his love language or not, he should be going out of his way to at least do one! Just one thing for you if he knows it’s what makes you happy. 

It sounds like you aren’t getting what you want back in your relationship and it doesn’t seem like it’s gonna change especially after 3 years of being together. It might be time to move on sooner than later bc you’re gonna feel like you’re settling for the rest of your life."

I don’t have the sexual anxiety, but anxiety is anxiety. I would recommend maybe a sex therapist if you haven’t already gone to one. A sex therapist could really help you dive deeper into these intimacy issues even more so than a regular therapist. I think there might be a deeper reason as to why you are afraid to initiate that’s aside from all that you’ve listed. It takes a lot of digging."
relationship_advice,fc39u74,t3_efvych,1577384954.0,"Wow. You’re an amazing parent.  By you handling it this way you set an extremely healthy tone for his future. Mad respect for being so understanding with him and allowing him to know it’s okay to be who he is and to also not be shamed for exploring natural things. Now he’s going to have more confidence in himself and pride himself in the future, and be happier and more confident about his decisions. You just instilled a lot of security in him. You just built so much trust parent to child and I’m not sure how much you realize the amount. 

My dad always said, “I know this stuff happens, I know you’re going to try alcohol at some point, and I know you’re going to explore other things, so if you’re ever in a bad situation I want you to call me, I promise won’t be mad.” He always wanted me to be able to trust him and tell him things so that I could remain safe and also learn from my own mistakes. When I did mess up, he had a mature talk with me and assessed the lessons I could take from it. He was very understanding and never judged me for who I was or for anything I did if it was something he knew I would learn from. The new lock on the door is a huge step up in trust too. 

I think where I’m going here is that no matter what it is whether that be sexuality, teenage antics, and or other things, the healthy bond you are building is amazing and it all surrounds the facet of understanding and accepting your children for who they are and loving them unconditionally no matter who they are or want to be by teaching them love and trust every day. 

Idk overall this post is amazing from the acceptance of your gay child to taking above and beyond steps to instill security and trust in both him and your relationship... I just gave this post 2 awards.
