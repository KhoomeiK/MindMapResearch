There’s a reason why they excel so much in competition (rally, obedience, hunting, etc) and also used for service, guidance, and even by security teams around the world. They’re among the most trainable of all breeds, learning new things scarily fast. They’re also at the top of all breeds when it comes to problem solving and figuring things out using their own mental faculty. This was part of the largest and most cited study of dog intelligence. Remember, even smart dogs are still dumb, and there is variance, and a smart dog raised to basically do nothing but sit there and look good and not use it’s brain will probably act that way."

movies,ffc1guo,t1_ffbxgzl,1579789132.0,"Eh, I strongly disagree about 2049. It's pretty bad. Roger Deakins beautiful cinematography couldn't save that script. The movie did very little to continue the story from the first movie and explore the world it created. The film just has no reason to exist. Performance wise, Leto was dreadful. He acted like he was on a stage speaking out to a crowd of thousands whenever he spoke. He just sucked all the air out of the room whenever he was on screen. Hans Zimmer's music was a dud, and the music was a big part of the feel of the world in the original. Speaking of the world, I hate how you never get a good feel for the scope of the world. All the establishing shots are so zoomed in and too close, so you feel very unsure of where you are in context of everything -- the buildings, city, and more. Overlooking a lot of that, worst of all, the film just has very little replay value. Most scenes feel tedious and dispensable watching them again."

There is a tradition of making the Grace Ennis [Santa and Tree](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/santa-and-tree-christmas-stocking-9001c) stockings in my family, but since my grandma died, there is no one alive who currently knits.     

I'm doing another very similar pattern by Grace Ennis that's a [Reindeer and Sleigh](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/reindeer-and-sleigh-christmas-stocking-9002c).

1. I accidentally put too many spaces between the ""R"" and bottom of the ""S"" in the name BUTTERS. I need one white stitch at the bottom on the left and I need to make the bottom right of the ""S"" red. You can see this in the photo above. Not sure if it's possible to fix this.
