The 30 acres matter a lot though... buildable for future development? timber land? Environmental issues? Is there a major buffer area to waterways near/on the land that restrict use? Is the lot size an irregular shape? Does it border BLM, railroad, freeway/interstate or industrial operations? Zoning restrictions, can it be subdivided, developed, or is it part of a protected wildlife area? Is it in a floodzone? All these things will matter differently to buyers who have a specific goal in mind.

Mini-farm, income opp by leasing unused land for grazing/tree farming, if the property is treed, future timber value, tiny home, solar power conversion easily possible if not treed, fit for horses? Build a dream home on it. I've seen plenty of ads for big properties with trailers/unlivable homes using 'build your dream home' type marketing angles. Seem to sell slower but DO sell.

Sort of a disclaimer: Honestly wouldn't care one bit about the structure on it if I were buying it. If any thing it having a double wide would make it more appealing to me because I wouldn't be paying for too much for the package deal that includes a big new house that I don't want any way. Dirt is king to me. Unfortunately the utilities have to be in place or able to be put in place - which you've already got there. ^((why are you selling?! sounds like a dream to me))

For those who dislike multiple tabs, highly condensed summary with loads of missing facts yet still (currently) accurate:

Typically mortgage lending uses the following:

* Fico Score 5 from Equifax  (also known as EQ-04 or Beacon 5)
* Fico Score 4 from Transunion (also known as TU-04 or Transunion FICO Risk Score Classic 04)
* Fico Score 2 from Experian  (also known as EX-98 or Risk Model v2)

The basic FICO credit score that consumers purchase from Equifax, Transunion and Experian are generally the score that is used for many revolving Credit Cards & Personal Loans not autos/mortgages.

The ""free"" credit scores that are indeed FICO scores that are available through some consumer credit cards/banks (like Discover) are of the FICO model used typically for credit cards & personal loans, not autos/mortgages.

To complicate further there's a special version of FICO Scores for auto loans, too.

The credit score versions that aren't labeled as Fico Scores are not Fico at all, they're simply credit scores based on non-FICO algorithms. An example is Vantage Score, which is referred to as a credit score also.

To round it off, some companies who offer consumer loans used their own internal proprietary risk-based algorithm models as well.

AND... Fico Score 10 and Fico Score 10T are being rolled out this year, so things will change yet again.

realtors,ff54a5q,t3_erhg2g,1579579822.0,"A little very real life story:

A house across the street was foreclosed on. The owner died & relatives let it go. It sat empty for a while before the bank finally got it listed. During the vacant time, one of the neighbors took it upon himself to weedwhack/mow the front yard to keep it 1/2 decent. Otherwise the weeds grew 3 feet tall in the front yard. He never did the back yard.

Around the time the bank was listing it, a loud beat up truck with a driver, passenger, 2 guys in the bed of the truck with a garbage can, lawn mower, and random yard tools came around the corner, slowly, looking suspicious in a nice quiet tight-knit neighborhood. They went to the dead end, turned around, parked in front of the house and started getting ready to clean up the property.

I ran to inside my own house, grabbed a $20 and ran back across the street to them. Asked them to please do a *really* nice job, as we've all been putting up with that house empty and keeping an eye out for squatters. We wanted it looking 'lived in' finally. They said, don't worry about it, **the bank is paying us.**

WHAT?!

I insisted they take the money.  I don't know the ins & outs of it, but maybe contact banks for maintenance on their owned properties. Maybe the realtor told them the banks were paying for it, who knows. Point is, they were employing themselves in at least some capacity and the property was getting cleaned up. Win-win.

These characters that were in that beat up truck... If I profiled people, I'd say they all had at least 2 felonies and if any of them were not recently on parole I'd be amazed. Big big heavy set red haired tattooed to the max 'chick' was ""the boss"" they said, and for me to give the money to her. She was also the driver as apparently it was her truck.

Do NOT offer partial payment acceptance. That will likely disqualify him from receiving any program help for funds to pay you. If he later offers it without prompting, proceed with caution. If you offer it first,and he mentions it while trying to get rent assistance you'll likely lose out on some if not all potential rent monies.

Depending on the state, if he goes to the local welfare assistance office with proof that he is able to make payments (as in he gets an offer of employment with a start date), they may have a ONE TIME ""grant"" that will pay for ONE month's rent to keep him from being homeless (him having kids will help with this).

If you're not up on being PC 100% of the time, get that way. Or you won't keep any job you land here either ahead of time or afterward very long at all.

If you're not used to doing everything & anything that you do in your life outside of 4 walls in the rain, and cannot quickly and HAPPILY adapt to doing so, you will want to move shortly after settling in.

I've never known anyone on that level, in real estate or not, at least before him. He knew basically everything about the local market trends, local buyer attitude, so much contractual experience, he absolutely stopped the possibilities of problems BEFORE he even listed the house on MLS. Seriously. Amazing. Dare I say perfect. 

I sent him gifts *even way after the sale* & he's still on speed dial, just in case.

He ***nailed*** the interview stage. 

1. He listened like a best friend combo'd with master level quiet confidence sans ego. 
2. Asked minimal questions to clarify *not* doubt, and returned to step 1 before continuing to step 3.
3. Then told me what I wanted to hear and *backed it up with comps, spreadsheets, etc. on the spot*. 

**In other words, he came to the interview fully prepared to make it inevitable for me to sign with him.**

During the house selling processes, he made serious 'matter-of-fact' promises and stood by them every step of the way. Response times perfect. Actions, perfect. There were no impromptu re-actions, he already had the chess game type scenarios won from the initial contracts stages. 

When everything was said and done and I'd been on vacation for a few weeks, I did the math. He's grossing a cool million a year MINIMUM, because he's consistently selling at least one property a week. I lucked out in the best way possible finding him. A million. US Dollars. In a year. One year. My Mind Was Blown.

Now that's interesting even if merely from a statistical point of view. MLM angle indeed. Except for about how many typical sales in what average time frame before agents become brokers themselves. Even so, it's very low risk & high potential of breaking even or better for the original broker. Depending of course on how many people get licensed & don't pay attention to the what for & how to. She must, I'd imagine, have some sort of contract to recapture her costs for non performance type people. Although perhaps it's a business tax write-off worth her playing the odds, too. Hmm.

The only other question I found was some comments elsewhere about taking off the cap of the fluid reservoir before doing anything with the brakes, something something pressure on the ABS. I don't even know if this car has ABS. I'll have to look since it's optional not standard for this car.

Thanks and learned more than I thought here especially about why not to use brake fluid once it's open. I was going to cheap out and see if I had an open container somewhere but nope, lol, not now. I'll need to get *fresh* fluid and the lubrication. Will be interested to see if they sell very small bottles of fluid since it's wasteful otherwise! 

We have more snow here tonight/still freezing temps so coming week will get to them. Figures the one vehicle I've got a studded set of tires for is the one that had this brake issue right before the first snow of the year. Life. Wow."

The minimum wage increases have been discussed in-depth by my family also since first voted in to being. We're all steadfastly opinionated with different economic experiences (small town, big city, logging industry, IT sector, imports/exports) and multi-generational biased perspectives and the only certain agreed upon conclusion is it's not a win-win situation. Something's got to give, what does first and the collateral damage and benefit theories make for interesting mini-debates. Luckily we all can and do agree to disagree at the end of the day! 

I do agree more studies are useful, yet in the meantime I'd like to find the currently experienced trends specifically in the Seattle area so I can at least make educated guesses at what my next moves should be. 

**This is the first time in my life I've ever had hours reduced.** On salary I've been laid off before and it sucked. Once due to offshoring and once due to funding cuts in the US Forest Service.

Looking for current data on the unemployment rates turned up this: [esd.wa.gov/labormarketinfo/monthly-employment-report](http://esd.wa.gov/labormarketinfo/monthly-employment-report) which I'll also be watching closely now purely out of curiosity.

Your ""find a new job"" is a bit ironic in retrospect. I was offered a different job last summer and turned it down due to the owner's probable inconsistency of hours offered. A small business owner with the freedoms to (and history of) re-set schedules on personal whims didn't mesh with my need/desire for at least semi-predictable scheduling. He literally begged me to work for him, shut the office door and repeated ""I need you"", offering more money, easier work, everything my current employer was offering except PTO and medical benefits. Now here I am. *Life is so weird.* Maybe I'll need him, too."
SeattleWA,fe01wyj,t1_fdzfyk4,1578801028.0,"I'm doing the math tonight to begin tracking patterns at least short-term. Schedules are posted in the lunchroom since we are allowed to trade shifts when need be vs. using PTO. It's pretty standard for employees to take smart phone pics of the schedules 2 weeks out, so I did so today. I'm currently analyzing positions that had hours reduced and in what ratios this coming week & will continue to do so for the foreseeable future in order to plan to the best of my ability.

I did anticipate the scenario you suggested while pondering the current reduced hour schedule on my way home today, however it's a little less pay even before the new-to-me insurance deductions. There's no crystal ball of course but them having money problems is a potential outcome."
