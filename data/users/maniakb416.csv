Maybe the co driver did his job and the driver didn't listen, but i think the navigator was at least partly at fault."

NoMansSkyTheGame,ffbk6st,t1_ffbdylv,1579769210.0,Burnout Paradise was a good example of this. They had a dlc to unlock all the cars at once instead of making you find and wreck them all. A friend of mine bought it on 360 and inexplicably got bored of the game a few days later. Imagine that.

gamegrumps,fenes0s,t1_fenb9uh,1579283130.0,"I'm gonna address your 3 points separately to explain why they are wrong.

1. You dont need to buy the DLC to get the Pokemon.
2. You don't need to buy Home to trade with your friends.
3. You don't even need friends to trade them because the game has online trading built in. 

You literally can get online, ask for a Galarian Slowpoke or whatever, pay nothing and get one from a stranger.
