If your parents and grandparents are open to the idea, a legal option may be  for you to move in with your grandparents. Again, speak with the district. Tell them you plan to move in with your grandparents and ask what you need to show in order to enroll. 

This would have to be a legit move, not just claiming it then spending half your nights at your parents. If you are genuinely a resident, you do qualify to attend the school. If this is a desirable school district, expect them to examine your claimed residency closely. It can get very expensive very fast for a school to have students from outside the district making false residency claims, so if it happens often, it's worth the school spending hundreds or even more to make sure you're a real resident."

But in the vast majority of America, cars are often a necessity and when not quite a necessity, are a massive convenience that allows a much more normal lifestyle. Going carless in most of America would mean sacrifices. This is not changing.

I'm in Las Vegas. Public transit is busses. They've got pretty good coverage in that the whole valley is covered, but they don't run very often and they're much slower than driving. I don't use them so I can't speak to their cleanliness or timeliness.  But looking at the schedule, it would be a 2 and a half hour trip to get to my job on 2 separate busses, or 40 minutes by car.

Almost everyone finishes high school in 4 years, when they're 17 or 18. In my school, 100% of the kids who didn't graduate and didn't drop out were Special Ed students who couldn't be expected to achieve anything close to a normal education and would never receive a diploma. There had to be a transition for them to leave despite never reaching independent adulthood. Age 21 gives people plenty of time beyond the normal 4 years while also making sure school districts don't have to pay for educational daycare for a 40 year old who finally learned to use a fork last year. Disabled adult care sucks in this country, but it's a very good thing school systems aren't responsible for it.

For adults with normal abilities, there are perfectly good, age appropriate options for getting a General Education degree. If you failed to get a high school diploma in the normal time line or a couple years beyond, it's not reasonable to expect society to pay for your education for an unlimited number of years while you continue to fail."

That said, I don't think it's a societal problem that kids can earn that kind of money. I just think that whether it's going to do a particular kid any good in the long term is always an open question and depends on a lot more than their current dollar value.

Most of my friends were also unhappy in their ""career"". Even the ones who thought they knew what they wanted and were making good money got punched in the face by the real world.

Food moralizing, like calorie counting or low-carb, might help some people eat well, but it's 100% not a requirement for living a healthy life."
AskAnAmerican,fedhglc,t3_eolpgs,1579011622.0,"Pretty much not true. The shy, introverted kids are usually just gonna hang out with their own friends. 

Socially awkward kids, introverted or not, have a harder time, but even they're more likely to be ignored and snubbed than beat up and bullied. Which  still hurts a lot when you're that age and just want to fit in. Bullying is heavily looked down on and while it certainly happens anyway, it's not common and not like in the movies.

That said, this will be very heavily dependent on the school you go to."

If they somehow successfully carried out this fraud and essentially became another person and didn't get caught, then they would have to continue pretending to be a different person to get their (fraudulent) green card. Using their initial, honest date of entry would simply uncover their fraud. So to get a green card they would have to use the entry date of their new, fake identity. And if they ever got caught, even after becoming citizens, they would be permanently banned because of the lies on their application."
