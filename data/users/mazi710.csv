coolguides,ffbdb4d,t1_ffba97y,1579760506.0,"Many of them are just worded wrongly, or is technically true, but not ""really"" true, or just not true at all. An example of all 3 of those is ""Espresso has more caffeine"".

1. More caffeine than what? You can say ""more than"" without defining what you're comparing it to.

2. A shot of espresso *technically* has the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee. The same way a shot of vodka has the same amount of alcohol as a pint of beer. Technically not a lie, but you're comparing two different things, in vastly different volumes and concentrations.

3. Which makes it's false, because to compare it equally you'd have to say ""per oz"" for example, and then espresso clearly has more. That whole statement is literally the same as saying ""Vodka has more alcohol"" is a myth. It just doesn't make any sense as a statement by itself.


Also ""searing meat makes it more juicy"". Again, *technically* no, but if you want something that is edible and is possible to eat volunteerly, searing meat is a great trade off between juicy and bland poached steak. Technically the best way to lock in moisture is poaching. Which is what Sous Vide is. So you Sous Vide (low temp poach) it for juiciness, and then it looks absolutely wet and disgusting. And then sear it super hard for flavor, texture, and looks afterwards. So again, technically true, just pretty stupid, and in real life scenarios, it isn't really a myth. Many of these ""myth"" are just the guide taking what people say too literal.

SampleSize,fek2y5q,t3_eph841,1579191491.0,"This is a little of a hard topic because it depends so much on country to country. A lot of European countries already have something similar to UBI. Not exactly ""Here's money to everyone no matter the reason"". But like you get government support for unemployment, paternity leave, paid to take all educations, free healthcare, no tax for the first $600 earned each month etc. So there's not really a lot of scenarios where a person would just be completely without help from the government and be homeless or in that much of need without help already.

So like for me personally i don't think in my country we need UBI, and i don't think it makes a lot of sense, but because we already have a system i feel like that works and gives to the poor without giving to people who don't need it. And then that might kinda skew the answers in the survey and make it seem like i think the whole concept of giving to the needy is bad. And i actually think UBI is worse than proper wealthfare because UBI also gives money to people who don't need it, meaning the needy would technically get less. And then also let's say you get $1,000 a month. Well great, but that doesn't really matter if you get cancer in the US and it still cost like $250,000.

Then you could argue it's up to each person to invest their UBI wisely to spend it on healthcare etc. and not on TV's and cars, but i highly doubt that's gonna happen. And since the whole point of UBI would be better wealthfare, i think it makes a ton more sense to make ACTUAL wealthfare better instead of just giving ""free money"" to everyone to spend as they please. That doesn't fix the broken systems, especially in countries like the US that has basically no wealthfare. I think it would make a lot more sense to focus on free basic healthcare and education."

So for instance if someone steals your car and you have it on video, he didn't steal that car until a judge sentences that he did. Innocent until proven guilty. Unfortunately that means your video isn't proof of a crime, until a court says it is. So releasing your video of the thief's face would be illegal. But if it's evidence in a legal case the court/police can decide to release it. But a civilian can't.

fuckthesepeople,fe6khkk,t1_fe6fw1x,1578893882.0,"Ehh, in what world does newer diesels get 1/3 the fuel economy of old ones???? That's just not true. Newer engines are way more efficient, both in diesel and gasoline. Your comment seems like you haven't read about diesels the last 10 years. There's a LOT of difference from a 2010 diesel to a 2020 diesel. Mainly because of all the research that have been done lately. VW's Dieselgate was half a decade ago.

And your straight pipe comment makes absolutely no sense. Remember Dieselgate? Yeah, so that emitted 40 times(!) More on the road, than it did in tests. You need to get 4000% better mpg without a particle filter to make up for it.

But yeah, diesels with particle filters and AdBlue have actually recently been proven to polute way way less than gasoline. It's just weird how Americans don't drive diesel except in trucks. It's very common for regular cars to be diesel in Europe. They actually tested a Peugeot 308 last year, and the diesel emitted 46 times less particles than the gasoline. And the diesels exhaust fumes had less particles than the sourrouding air. These newer diesels vehicles get like 50-60mpg of actual driving, where as a gasoline might only get 40mpg. It depends on the car and the situation. My car is gasoline and small but since I don't commute highway it gets 50mpg still. Rule of thumb is diesel gets around 20-30% more mpg than gas. Go ahead and find me a old diesel that gets 150mpg as you claim.

There's has been a lot of research on it and it's pretty clear particle filters are way better. Idk where you get this ""it haven't been researched"" thing from, it's pretty black and white at this point. There's absolutely no way that straight piping a diesel is even considerable for pollution. There's a reason it's demanded by law in Europe that all new diesels have a particle filters. Ironically VW's Dieselgate have resulted in way cleaner diesel cars now. The Danish Scientific Institute did tests on Peugeot, and ADAC in Germany did tests on 13 different car models. All were real driving tests.

It's due to misinformation like this that people hate diesel. Reality is that in 2020 diesels are a very viable option for polluting less, old diesels are NOT.

TL;DR: MODERN diesels with particle filters are in most cases better for the environment than gasoline, there's absolutely no way that old diesels, diesels without particle filters, or straight piped diesels are. And if you ever see black smoke that is soot and is indeed very very very bad for your health and the environment."

Yeah, it doesn't taste like actual truffles or replace real truffles. Imo truffle oil is what Kraft singles are to cheese. Not ACTUAL cheese, but i dont think it's outrageous to use nor does it taste that bad, and I can see why people would use. But maybe that also comes from me personally thinking truffles are highly overrated and is often used to make a regular dish ""fancy"". Like a $2 mac and cheese isn't $20 good just because it has truffles in it. I think it makes more sense to put $0.1 of truffle oil into a $2 a Mac and cheese, instead of ""wasting"" $15 of truffles on it. The same way you probably wouldn't drink expensive champagne with a hot dog. But to each their own.

Edit: I also guess it depends highly on what truffle oil you use. I googled it, and apperantly it's pretty common for cheap truffle oil to not actually contain truffles at all and be 100% synthetic. The one I use is 51% white truffles in sunflower oil so idk if I actually ever had synthetic truffle oil."
SampleSize,fdjfo3n,t1_fdje1r3,1578468792.0,"The whole point is kinda that half the options (and the most popular I would assume) is that it's inappropriate if it's someone of the opposite sex. This would assume that's it's because there could be something sexual between a straight man and woman. So everyone who picked that doesn't think two straight men, or two straight women together is wrong, because nothing sexual will happen. However if it's two gay men or two gay women, they would be of the same sex, but since they're homosexual, something sexual could happen.

What could have fixed this without adding more questions would have been to replace ""people of the same sex"" to ""people of a sex they aren't sexually attracted to"" and vice versa. It is kinda an issue in this survey, because the survey assumes people to be straight, so what might be the intention with the answers, will be the exact opposite for gay people. So yes, people's sexual orientation in this would be very relevant.

If you've sat down intensively full time for 4 years every day (or however long the education you're trying to apply for takes), and you learn the same amount of stuff and is on par with everyone else knowledge and skill vice and can show it, an employee will definitely look at your application just like anyone else. Again, portfolio matters. Let's say you wanna be a programmer and you go ""look at this app/website/program/game/whatever I made"", that counts for a lot.

Men ja hvis den kommer, og kommer til at koste det så vil det være interessant. Dog skal det lige nævnes at det altså ikke er en normal bil. Den har 44hk og kan kører 100 km/t. Så udelukkende en bybil. Det er vel lige steppet over en Renault Twizy :)"
Denmark,fcx2jnz,t1_fcx1r3d,1578048387.0,"Ja hvis man vælger at bruge fast abonnement som Clever, det kommer an på ens behov. Og jo, afgiften er fordoblet for alt ladning til elbil, både der hjemme og på ladestander. Clever har nok valgt ikke at fordoble deres priser endnu fordi det vil skræmme folk væk. Men det er altså rigtigt nok det er blevet dobbelt så dyrt i afgift, det er en lov, det er der ingen der kommer udenom. 

Og ja det er rigtigt at dyrere elbiler er billige relativt til benzinbilerne, det er jo fordi der ikke er afgift på. Sammen grund til en Tesla Model 3 koster 400,000kr, og den ville koste en million hvis der var afgift på. En Golf koster jo ikke 250,000kr hvis den havde samme afgift som en elbil. Så ja, hvis man er ude i at købe en ny bil til 250k+ så ville jeg også vælge en elbil hvis man havde muligheden for det."

Det er den første elbil man kan få for under 200,000kr. Det er stadig over 75% dyrere end benzin, men det er i det mindste ved af være realistisk for folk at købe. En benzin Mii kostede altså 85,000kr i benzin. Så for 20,000kr mere kunne du have købt to som benzin. Men som sagt, tror de bliver vigtige elbiler for danskerne. Så mangler vi bare resten af problemer kommer med også. Jeg synes personligt folk overdriver deres range anxiety med elbiler totalt, men de er opgivet til 250km og det tror jeg desværre er i den lave ende af hvad folk vil gå med til. Men det er en skide god bybil, og lukker et stort hul i markedet. Hvis man har mulighed for at lade."
Denmark,fcwyl0k,t1_fcwxvd0,1578043205.0,"~~Ja pt. Inden de hæver strømpriserne, så er det billigt at lade. SÅ billigt er det nu heller ikke.~~ Edit: De har lige fordoblet strømpriserne fra det nye år* 

Jeg regnede på det da jeg skulle have bil for nyligt, og det er stadig ikke at en elbil sparer så meget i drift, at det udligner den dyre indkøbspris. Jeg pendler 30.000km om året og det koster cirka 1700kr om måneden i benzin, elbil ville være cirka ~~500kr~~1000kr i strøm hvis jeg lader derhjemme (ladestander pris ikke medregnet). Men det udligner som sagt ikke det lån jeg har på en 130.000kr bil, vs. lån på en 240.000kr elbil. Og hvis du kigger online efter diverse test osv. ved feks FDM, så er totalomkostninger ved elbil altså slet ikke så meget at spare. Staten har lige fra 1. Januar lukket for proccesstrøms ""loopholet"", så det er lige blevet DOBBELT så dyrt at lade. Det er et sindsygt kæmpe spring, så der er altså endnu mindre at spare nu. Det er altså ikke billigere i drift at have elbil, end diesel feks. 

Og ja, de vil selvfølgelig falde i pris med tiden, men som sagt så er problemet jo så at staten vil putte mere og mere afgift på løbende, i takt med at bilens pris falder, og så ender man cirka samme sted vi er nu med normale biler. Så overall koster det det samme i driftsomkostninger, og pt. er elbiler meget dyrere end almindelige biler, og elbiler vil stige i afgift.

Denmark,fcvqyw7,t1_fcvgsmc,1578008114.0,"Grøn energi er altid godt, men angående elbiler så er batteri produktion og priser altså stadigvæk et problem. Især i Danmark hvor vi kører i billige og små biler. Selv billige elbiler er for dyre pt. til at de fleste mennesker har råd til dem. Bare den nye Peugeot 208 for eksempel som er Danmarks bedste sælgende bilmodel, 140k for benzin, 240k for el. Det er altså en kæmpe forskel. Det er ikke de fleste der har 240k til en bil, og især ikke en Peugeot 208.
Udover det så har staten heller ikke nogen som helst konkret plan omkring hvad fremtiden vil være med elbiler pt, udover de jo nok vil stige i pris. Både i afgift og blive meget dyrere at lade, så det går faktisk den forkerte vej. Planen om at de skulle stige i afgift fra 2020 blev droppet en måned før det træd i kraft. Det er altså ret absurd at sløjfe noget så stort med så kort varsel. Nu er planen bare at det er udskudt til næste år, så må vi se hvad der sker. Men uanset hvad aner de i hvert fald ikke hvad de vil, men de skal jo have nogle skattekroner i kassen, og pt er der stort set ikke afgift på elbiler. Udover det så gør staten heller ikke rigtig noget i forhold til at få ladestandere osv. op. Har du været i Norge for nyligt? Ved ikke hvad lovgivningen er omkring det der men ALLE butikker, offentlige p-pladser, hoteller, ALT har gratis p-plads og ladning for elbiler. Det er sådan en kæmpe fordel at have elbil i Norge da landet allerede er indrettet efter det. I Danmark er staten bare langt bagefter og står bare og siger ""øh... Vi ved det ikke, men ser skal i hvert fald afgift på"". Og så det største problem, halvdelen af befolkningen bor steder de ikke har mulighed for at lade deres bil.

 El er selvfølgelig vejen frem, men det er nemmere sagt end gjort ""bare at komme af med benzinbilerne""."

You can't really say that just because of her age, imo it's never too early to have sex talks.

I just never met a person in real life go ""Hi can I have a large coffee please, also, I'm gay."", like who are these people that talk about their sexual orientation every chance they get.

Also a German institute, KIT and ADAC came to the same conclusion that modern diesel engines with particle filters emits less particles than an equivalent petrol engine. Diesels used to be horrible, but modern diesels with particle filters are a whole other story. The Danish test actually showed the exhaust gas had 46 times less particles in diesel vs petrol, and the diesel exhaust gas had fewer particles than the air on the sidewalk. A big part of it is also the introduction of AdBlue, which have been a thing for a while but not that used.

worldnews,fcjo055,t1_fcjnne4,1577695959.0,"Well I'd rather it be co2 based, because currently diesel is more expensive because it has higher brackets, but modern diesel vehicles don't polute more than gasoline. And with the new WLTP method of calculating the kml, it's actually fairly realistic. I actually just looked it up, my car was rated at 26,8kml with the old rating system, and the new one is rated only at 20kml. And with cars in general but especially with small engines it depends entirely on your driven style. I get around 15kml on the highway with 130kmh, and around 22kml with cruise control set at 80kmh. I only drive 80kmh or below to work, so my commute actually gets around 20-24kml real kml. So I would say 20kml is probably a very accurate estimate of mixed driving. 

Although the only (but huge) flaw with the current testing method is with plug in hybrids. Like the Kia Niro for example is advertised with huge letters getting 75kml, which tbh I think is so immoral it's basically a scam. Because let's say they test the car for 50km. It goes 40km on pure electricity, then 10km on like 15kml, then you average that out and you get this useless inflated unrealistic number, which you are then taxed off of. But again the yearly emission tax is a tiny part of the issue, so I don't really care that much about that."
worldnews,fcjn7rj,t1_fcjmvca,1577694861.0,"Yeah it's based off of km/l consumption, I pay around $180 for a 20km/l Suzuki Swift. It ranges from around $150-2000 a year. It's also funny because the factory km/l numbers just got a lot smaller recently with the new measuring technique, so identical cars are now more expensive because they're in a different bracket. For example the Peugeot 208 and Citroen C3 diesels were rated at 33km/l diesel, and now they're only 24km/l I think. Making the 2019 models like 50% more expensive in yearly tax compared to identical earlier registered models. But this tax is very small compared to our insane tax when purchasing a vehicle. Currently EV's are exempt from the tax if they're below a certain price (which is completely arbitrary and makes no sense) and if they're above a certain price, it's calculated based on kwh consumption. The governments goal is by 2023 EV's yearly tax is raised fully to match ICE."
worldnews,fcjhg49,t1_fci2q4p,1577687731.0,"It's funny because it's the same in Denmark, by 2030 government wants 1/5 vehicles on the road to be electric. Currently there is 10% tax on electric vehicles, 150% on regular vehicles, so buying a Tesla Model 3 is almost the same price as a Ford Fusion/Mondeo. But of course the government wanna raise the taxes on electric cars now, AND the price of electricity used for charging, because they aren't getting any tax from EV's. Issue just is even with the ridiculous insane tax difference, it's still only around 1% of new cars that are electric, because electric cars have a higher starting price. Most cars that drive on the road, are cheaper than even the cheapest electric car. Just take the new Peugeot 208 for example, the ICE and EV are otherwise identical, the EV is almost twice as expensive as the ICE. So yeah, idk how the government is gonna fix electric car prices first. The majority of regular people just can't really afford EV's right now, and then when EV's start to get cheaper, the government will almost certainly add more and more tax until it comes back up from 10, to 150% for EV's too. Because the Danish government LOVES their car tax, I doubt it'll go down to a sane level in my life time. But yeah, if you have the money buy a EV now and make it last as long as possible because the tax is only at the time of purchasing the vehicle. Which is also gonna screw with used prices.

So for example let's say hypothetically in 2021 they're gonna raise the tax on EV's to 100%. Then a 2020 Tesla 3 will have a value of around $50,000 used, and a 2021 identical car has a used value of around $100,000. So everyone is gonna fight to get the older models because they were basically tax exempt. They aren't gonna raise it that fast, but the governments plan was 10% increase a year in EV tax. It's so counterintuitive and stupid. But of course the government is in a little bit of a dilemma when they want both everyone to drive EV's, but then also wanna do absolutely nothing to encourage people to drive EV's, hell, they wanna make it 10% more expensive per year. Let's see how this plays out because if it's gonna increase to ICE tax, then the new Peugeot 208-E would be like $65,000 when the ICE is $20,000."
