CRedit,ff22g3x,t1_fe4ztvb,1579491987.0,I’m not saying someone should have to trust and rent to you when they don’t know you. The crux of my argument is that it’s a problem if someone can be categorically ineligible for any housing whatsoever. You disagree. We’re done.
CRedit,fe4nc5s,t1_fe4kw44,1578861083.0,"I can understand it that way from the lender’s perspective, but what happens to people who “probably shouldn’t have an apartment” but for whom living with family is not an option? My solution was to rent a room in someone’s house, but that’s pretty competitive, and there are a lot of people out there looking to take advantage of someone in that spot.

Also, no one seems to disagree that if someone has nowhere to live but an apartment yet did not have the opportunity to save prior to ending up in that situation, they’ll be SOL if they lose their job; they simply disagree that that’s a bad thing or might carry implications for domestic violence survivors, people whose families are unable or unwilling to put them up, etc.

Energy depleted. Getting off Reddit."

WorkOnline,fe40y2n,t1_fe2zssb,1578854699.0,"That’s what Go Go Kids said. It was one on one, but I got zero feedback even though that doesn’t usually happen. Although I fully recognize I look insane vs super friendly and relatable why I try to be as perky as they want, so that may be the issue."
CRedit,fe40cm7,t1_fdxwisa,1578854592.0,"It’s tough not to take it personally when my credit score dropping might mean homelessness if I needed to find a different rental in the future. Create a system that makes it possible for someone to be ineligible for housing, and things get personal."
CRedit,fe3zvf5,t1_fe347rc,1578854458.0,"You lost your job. It’s early on, or your job didn’t pay well/barely covered anything with little left over, so you have no savings. If you have monthly payments or an apartment and no one to cover you, you’re SOL, and your credit score will absolutely tank."
WorkOnline,fe2r5i2,t3_enod0a,1578841959.0,One of these rejected me without an explanation at all. I’m not sure what I did wrong.
CRedit,fdxm2ql,t3_enbkty,1578770492.0,"What I don’t get is why a no-fault lay-off that costs you early in your career means that when you have a stable job again, you’re less worthwhile. Or why having credit card debt is necessary in order to look like you can handle debt."
povertyfinance,fdxlxao,t1_fdw8vtm,1578770403.0,Ask what a monthly arrangement would look like if you were able to send proof of financial hardship.
povertyfinance,fdxkglk,t1_fdw8l6v,1578769716.0,Not sent doesn’t mean Medicaid is not responsible afaik. That sounds like an internal error they’d have to pay out if you complained to the right people.
povertyfinance,fdw1tbi,t3_en738p,1578754167.0,"Contact the collector and request that the debt be marked as disputed on your credit report and that you be sent proof of what you owe. Then, get a copy of your insurance card and explanation of benefits and make your case to both Medicaid and the collector. Also find out why it wasn’t covered. If it was not covered due to improper coding, you may need to provide an expert opinion explaining the mistake, in writing. Good luck!

If all else fails, request a monthly arrangement and be prepared to provide proof of financial hardship to get lower payments.

Also, if letters were not sent to you, request a copy of all those letters and ask what address they were sent to."

I have no clue what slur this post contained."
GCdebatesQT,fdp9x3s,t3_emkede,1578623417.0,"I’m super curious myself, especially since under self-ID, people tend to say “I was always a _______” while detransitioners often say they were never that gender and just falsely believed it."
