gaming,ffmglwt,t1_ffmghx5,1580054369.0,You couldn't possibly know that a dualshock 4 is cheaper then a PS4!
gaming,ffmfvsc,t1_ffmd75o,1580054117.0,Brand new? I doubt he bought them from Boeing direct. Planes get retired and scraped.
gaming,ffmfsgt,t1_ffmfj3p,1580054073.0,Precisely. Unless you're telling the guy to change his passion from flying jets to some kind of super cheap self assemble ultra light death trap (and even then it'd be a toss up on what's cheaper).
gaming,ffmfkt7,t1_ffmclqk,1580053941.0,"Exactly. I was looking up articles about cheap planes because it got me thinking and one listed a 61 Piper Colt for $19500. Apparently it requires an annual inspection that cost $5k. That's one massive cost straight off the bat. It's not a poor mans hobby, even on the cheaper end. 

Don't get me started on boats. Why people don't just hire them when they actually plan to use them I don't know. Same as jet skis. It's like buying a time share or something. You become obligated to use the water craft wether you feel like it or not. Fishing boats get a pass."
gaming,ffmefat,t1_ffmcu2r,1580053332.0,"That was my argument. I didn't think it was expensive at all if you're the one doing the hard work, not in comparison to owning an actual plane. Good to know the actual prices though. Much cheaper than a Cessna 150 and a pilots license. 

I don't personally have anything this expensive hobby wise but when you look at all the games across PS4 and Switch, a laptop and even more games on steam, I'm sure I've spent some where between $3-5k this game generation alone, if not more. If you look at some other hobbies like doing up cars or motorbikes (or real planes) this guy has spent a very reasonable amount. 

Also, a guitar player might only have one *nice* guitar but you know damn well they've got another half a dozen decent guitars that all add up to a fortune as well. And their one *nice* amp that's next to the several other lesser yet still not cheap amps. And their one *nice* pedal that they're not sure how to use all the features so they still use one of the dozen other pedals they have. I know how you people work."
