NarcissisticSpouses,fehxeba,t1_feg5j5d,1579125768.0,"Since I found out that my parents are both narcissist, I started to examine my behaviors a lot. I realized that I always learned from my mother how I should not behave, but I also learned from closer friends how I should behave.

So coming back to your question: I am regocnizing a lot of different behaviors already like: judging, being a know-it-all, telling yeah that's what I wanted to say. Maybe I am judging me to hard, I don't know. I realized that it always takes some time until I understand in what sense my behavior was cruel. So it's very difficult to me to judge correctly in the moment. I never learned the correct positive behavior."
socialanxiety,fe51j1v,t1_fe4t5yq,1578864824.0,I learned for myself that others often try to help and to be nice. On the other hand its difficult for them to chat with a depressed or anxious person. The solution for me on both sides is to overplay it and just keep the conversation positive.
socialanxiety,fe4r5u9,t1_fe3qy00,1578862004.0,Yeah good job man! I understand all the anxiety that you have felt in the situation. Please don't worry do much. The bartender only tried to be nice to you.

socialanxiety,fe1o02n,t1_fe0adpw,1578828867.0,"Completely agree! There are always people that are trying to help you. When you stop going out, they will stop reaching you."

You push yourself with a constant fear of doing something wrong to get the best out of you. To your outside world, that mechanism is working well, but it seems to create a big pain for you. It's difficult to change the mechanism how you work, but you can take small steps like: start a todo list and split between ""must"" and ""can""."
