You're just lying about the reality of the situation by introducing ""Oh, actually, maybe one medical expert said it could help!"" The Government was very clear if there was evidence to say either child could make it, they wouldn't tried that.

There was evidence, because there was a doctor willing to try a procedure. The problem is that you're weighing all evidence equally. In this case, evidence that would tend to lead to the child having a chance to live should be weighted more than evidence saying there was no chance.

Yes, but every day some of those regular workers are breaking away and becoming employers themselves. 

> If it's illegal prosecute- here is perhaps one of the main points/problems. Our government won't prosecute because it's too much work to take down rich people. It's a fusion reaction. Poor people are easier to arrest and jail because they generally don't have lawyers on retainer or aren't ""too big to fail"". So many banks and lending institutions played roles leading up to the 2009 financial meltdown and yet virtually no one was prosecuted.

Again, this goes down to the complexity of the law. Instead of trying to regulate the financial market and then finding that you can't prosecute because it's too complicated, keep the laws simple and you can, but only when they're broken.

> Simplify the tax law - another great suggestion except that most of those who make the laws are part of the wealthy elite (at least speaking of America). Corporate lobbyists/ politicians etc, are the primary cause of all this economic strife, but they create and control the laws that keep them wealthy/in power.

I agree, and it'll be difficult to put the toothpaste back in the tube, but that's why it shouldn't have been let out in the first place and why no more should be let out. Go as far back to the Roosevelts and Woodrow Wilson who were passing these kinds of regulations to try to control the economy. They opened it up to abuse.

Personally, no, but I would be willing to bet they're out there. In any case, it's not the employer's responsibility to make the employee happy or valued. It's their responsibility to pay them the agreed-upon wage.

Ah, but a loophole is not illegal. Again, if it is illegal, prosecute. And if it's so complicated that lawyers can change the outcome, then simplify the tax law. Tax revenue instead of profit, if you like. 

> Environment. Not talking about simply buying property. Extracting product/materials from the environment, be it fossil fuels, minerals, water etc. Corporations, for their bottom line, will find the cheapest way possible to do this.
