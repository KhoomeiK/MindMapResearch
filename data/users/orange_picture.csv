japanese,ffa88wx,t1_ff8e3d4,1579729803.0,"Concerning community colleges though, many community college do transfers to bigger universities and it saves a lot of money in the long run. My community college have a good transfer program to bigger 4 years universities, and we have to take the same basic courses. We also have many international students here. My tuition (in state at least) is around $1700, and that‚Äôs for 12 credit hours with no financial aids. My sister paid $9000 for the same courses at the 4 years university."

You can piece together a solid SP or FS program with these 3 musics though

lynxpointsiamese,fecf083,t1_fec9543,1578972345.0,"Yes, I think more of the darker color will show through that matches his paw pads and nose. The M marking on his forehead will get even more noticeable and probably the stripes on his legs too. 

Take lots of pictures now and compare them side by side later. They sure do grow up fast!"
lynxpointsiamese,fec1uld,t3_eodhj5,1578965410.0,"Looks like it! His coloring will probably change as he gets older. Mine looks a lot like yours when she was younger, her stripes are much more pronounced now that she‚Äôs a bit older."

soup,fd68i3y,t1_fd67vxu,1578187116.0,I think that‚Äôs the secret. You‚Äôre suppose to stir the soup to get it to swirl before you add in the egg.

soup,fd5h3yt,t1_fd3kjqf,1578177582.0,"It‚Äôs my own recipe. I used 2 cups of water and a chicken bouillon cube (I used Knorr‚Äôs) or 2 cups of chicken stock, 2 eggs, 1 tbsp of corn starch dissolved in 1 tbsp water, and 1 tbsp soy sauce. 

Bring the water or stock a boil and add the soy sauce, add the corn starch water and lower the heat. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Stir the soup around to give it a good swirl, and slowly add in the egg with out stirring it. The swirl is what suppose to give it the ribbon stage which I failed here so be sure to keep it swirling. Once all the egg is added turn off the heat. 

I served it with a little green onions, black peppers, and sesame oil."
soup,fd0zytc,t1_fd0sohy,1578126068.0,"The flavor was really good and the texture was also pretty good despite looking sort of lumpy. Imagine a soft egg custard like texture, like a really soft flan if you mash it into bits. I think I may used too much egg to soup ratio."
