Name one other heavyweight champion that can match or surpass that.  Also, Wilder has never lost a fight, so to say he was outclassed by others is without merit.  Wilder has been visibly hurt only once in his life after 43 fights, how many heavyweights go through their career being hurt for a total of 1 minute?  Wilder's KO punches are so hard, so fast that even on slow mo replay it's hard to see his punches.

Beltran's niece ""Oh Yeah Gleyber Torres uses the same buzzer system on his leg"" This is after Cora threw shade at the Yankees for having Beltran on their staff in 2019 then people started reading into it. Meanwhile Bellinger was like shame on everyone for cheating"
NYYankees,fenmg6k,t3_eq1ne2,1579287825.0,"BACKGROUND

Okay, so some background. The Houston Astros have been cheating for a long time in baseball, and a former player named Mike Fiers leaked it that they were cheating. So the day starts with Mets manager Carlos Beltran getting fired for his part in the cheating

Then, a Mets staffer goes on to complain about Fiers “Ratting out his teammates” Bad look. Then Beltran’s niece shows up and says that the Astros have been cheating for longer than thought, using electronic buzzers to signal what pitch is coming so they know what to swing at

 Mark Texiera and Carlos Gomez (two very good players) get into a feud cause Texiera says “Beltran would’ve been a clubhouse cancer” and Gomez says “Look who’s talking. Nobody likes you either mister”

THEN the son of the Mariners manager said the best player in baseball was on steroids, and Beltran’s niece is accused of actually being a player in disguise! THEN Mike Clevinger, one of the best pitchers in baseball, says he’s going to intentionally hit Astros players!

In the midst of all this chaos the Giants announce that they the first female batting coach in major league history. Lenny Dykstra, skeezy former player, says he wants to fuck the batting coach

People find what appears to be a wire tapped to one of the Astros players in 2019, but it’s actually just a piece of confetti. Alex Wood, another pitcher comes out and says he would rather face someone on steroids than someone who knows what’s coming

MVP Cody Bellinger and Yankee Gleber Torres take shots at each other, Belli says that the integrity of the game has been ruined and Torres criticizes Belli for his weed use

Alex Cora, the Red Sox GM is fired cause he was a bench coach during the Astros cheating run, and AJ Hinch was their manager at the time, and Jeff Lundhow, Astros GM steps down after being told to by Astros owner Jim Crane

Poor Mike Piazza, a hall of famer, is at a street naming ceremony when he is forced to ask questions about Beltran and the cheating. The attacks on Mike Fiers continue as Jessica Mendoza, an Astros employee, calls him a whiner"
