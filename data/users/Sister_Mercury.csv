AskReddit,ffn03zt,t1_ffmudsa,1580060641.0,"Oh, yeah.  I was discussing Japanese with some people who didn't speak it, way back in the day on IRC.  I tried to explain that you don't say ""aishiteru,"" and WHAM, kicked from channel.  By the time I got back in, the conversation was ancient history.  Turns out the romaji of aishiteru has a big ol' shit in the middle.

(Aishiteru means ""I love you.""  It's something you just don't say in Japanese culture.  It's like a hardcore declaration.  A better way to go is, ""I like you.""  Suki desu.)

(For the record, my Japanese ain't that good these days.  I'm working on it.)"

ETA:  if anyone asked, I told them it was for arthritis."

I have no real tolerance for people who are famous for being famous."

AskReddit,ffgg2tj,t1_ffg89h5,1579905433.0,"This kind of bullshit is why homelessness needs to be taken as a serious issue, not a moral judgement.  It's also why it's so important to show kindness and give chances where you can."
AskReddit,ffgfvc2,t3_etcyd6,1579905301.0,"If you want to create long-term improvement, teach boys that there's nothing shameful or emasculating about expressing themselves openly.  Boys and men in many cultures are taught that they can only share their emotions and difficulties with women--namely, a female partner.  This is actually part of the driving force behind domestic violence (going both ways; nearly all domestic violence sufferers are women, but that doesn't diminish what happens to men--pain is pain).  By combating toxic teachings, we can improve lives all over, including men's lives.

I hope this makes sense.  I'm a woman with a history of suicidal tendencies, and they're not fun.  I wish more people, especially men, felt able to discuss the situation, whether with a counselor, a therapy group, or friends and family.  There's a myth that Real Men are stoic, unemotional, and immune to pain.  That's bullshit.  All it does is hurt people, whether they be men who can't put up with the charade any longer and just want out, or partners who become sole secret keepers."
AmItheAsshole,ffg0qqt,t3_et8zc8,1579895958.0,"NAH.  Severe depression is a brutal, destructive condition.  Your mom needs medical help and therapy.  It'll take her a while to get back to herself, but she will get there.

The rest of you should look into therapy, too.

Take care of yourselves and each other.  Coming together will help more than you expect."

pettyrevenge,ffe5gp8,t1_ffd8sff,1579837201.0,"When I'm an asshole, it gets the point across quicker when my congenital and genetic disabilities and obvious abnormalities are brought into it.  This includes autism, ADHD, extreme pain, and weird joint positions.  ""She has become one with her pain and has settled in my ass,"" or something similar will catch my attention.

This isn't universal, I know.  However, many people tend to treat those of us with disabilities like we're made of spun glass and either unable to do anything cruel or thoughtless, or immune to criticism.  Just like anyone else, we sometimes need to be knocked down a peg.  At that point, we're just as open to casual observations and brutal criticism as any other jerk."
