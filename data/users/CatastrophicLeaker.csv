unpopularopinion,ff2x23n,t1_ff2wpas,1579527332.0,I don't think the pitbull fans realize how damning it is to say that they've never attacked like that before. So this is a dog that can flip on a dime and go from being very sweet to murdering a kid or a pet... and that makes it better?

unpopularopinion,ff2vhnl,t1_ff2lf52,1579525743.0,Most people instinctively know the truth about pitbulls but don't say anything because pit hags will go off on how it's racist to say that different dog breeds have different characteristics.

preppers,fexxlpt,t1_fetentj,1579437998.0,Yes it rarely kills healthy adults. Meaning it kills some healthy adults. Therefore if this virus doesn't kills any healthy adults then it's not as bad as the flu.

The state/legal system sees the situation once the kid is maimed or dead, then deals with the aftermath. Preventative measures happen at the legislative level and right now it's basically pitbull anarchy in much of America."
pitbullhate,fe4m0n9,t3_ensrvd,1578860714.0,I grew up with rottweilers as a kid and like them still and it remains true that they are technically capable of killing a kid or another dog. But pitbulls were bred specifically for the behavior to kill at a moment's notice and not stop until the target is dead. Rottweilers were not. That alone puts pitbulls in a different category.
