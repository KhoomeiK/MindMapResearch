Christ, I can't remember a single time I've seen a dog carcass on a highway [implying an incident like this], and I've lived in multiple states around the US years at a time, even been in a 4year LDR that necessitated a near-weekly 8hr drive both ways between three bible belt states, and I've even driven cross country coast to coast."
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffgi621,t1_ffgg2qc,1579906784.0,"How is filming ""so much worse"" when you can do it without having to pay attention to it? The dog isn't changing location so you don't *have* to monitor it, and it's stable because all they had to do was brace their hand on the door.

I'm not advocating doing any of this, but don't be melodramatic about it. It can already be bad enough without requiring you to exaggerate the task."
