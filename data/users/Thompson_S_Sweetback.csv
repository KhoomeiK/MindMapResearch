In this case, the loan contract is going to show that the parties intended the money to be repaid.  Whether it is enforceable as a loan contract is going to depend on lots of little things and is for an attorney to decide.  If it's an enforceable contract, then you can get things like attorney's fees (in my state.  States may differ).

However, even if it's not an enforceable contract, you can still sue to get your money back, so long as you can prove that it wasn't an outright gift.

AskReddit,fevmd6s,t1_fet9ksd,1579399065.0,"I don't think you can tie prohibition to fuel the way you can tie marijuana to paper.  Weed was never widespread recreationally, and hemp production fell apart after the disappearance of tall ships.  So when a major industrialist called for it to be demonized, there wasn't a very vocal opposition, especially an opposition with any connections.

Hard alcohol, on the other hand, was actually very closely tied to the lack of automobiles in America, in a sense.  America in the 18th and 19th centuries has always had a situation where poorer farmers in more remote areas would have difficulty transporting produce to markets and maintaining freshness.  

Alcohol is the solution to the problem.  You turn grain into whiskey, suddenly it's price per kilogram shoots way way up.  It's much more profitable, and it can be sold anywhere.  That's why the Whiskey Rebellion was about poor farmers vs. rich farmers, because whiskey was the only way those farmers had to make a living, whereas farmers situated closer to the coast had other options.

So in the late 19th century, the country had a glut of hard alcohol, and some folks were drinking it like water, especially in areas where water wasn't all that great an option.  I don't know how widespread a problem it was, but the temperance movement definitely had plenty of examples of abuse to drive their operation.  It was a real problem they were addressing, a nationwide problem, and not just a handful of day laborers in border counties written about by yellow journalists.

Maybe Rockefeller had his own reasons for supporting the prohibition movement.  But he didn't create it from whole cloth the way Hearst did."

I saw the way Obama's campaign worked in 2008, the way that Obama  or his campaign team planned meticulously and clawed tooth and nail for each delegate and each vote.  

To me, Bernie seemed like he was not in it to win it.  He talked about having a revolution that would sweep the entire country and give him a mandate.  But after the first few primaries, when that clearly wasn't happening, his message didn't change.  Hillary has never been my favorite person - my vote for Obama in 2008 was partly a vote against her - but Bernie did not seem like much of an alternative.

Now, in 2020, Bernie feels more like he's earned his spot near the top.  He's moved the Overton window on a number of issues. I really think he has the integrity to be the same man he's been for the past fifty years, which is something extremely rare in Washington right now.  Most imporantly, his voters are passionate, and I think passion wins elections more than numbers these days.  

My top choice is Warren.  I like nerds, I think she has integrity, and I think she'll be get more done than he would.  But if he's leading her when it gets to my state, I'll vote for him.  If there isn't a clear winner, I worry about second round shenanigans at the convention."
