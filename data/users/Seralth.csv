MordekaiserMains,fffvd1g,t1_fff7ixv,1579892612.0,"Sounds like some subpar mordes by chance. Sett Morse is actually a pretty even match up that can go either way pretty easy.

It's not a hard fight for either side either they both are pretty damn good at what they do."
pathofexile,fffuymm,t1_ffftped,1579892360.0,"Err you give more credit to the HC community then it deserves. Also for many of us it's more effort to open pob check it out then just say ""HEY YOU LET ME SEE DAT DAR ITEM"" while you have already teleported to their hideout and are making yer self at home at their stash.

The HC 5055 community is small enough that we can legitly speak using nothing but friend status updates and 95% of us will see every message."
pathofexile,fffnysi,t1_ffflaiu,1579888043.0,"Best part about the HC 5055 community. 90% of people are chill and have been around long enough that when you do get cases of ""can I try that on"" they actually will return it.

Couldn't even begin to think of trusting people like this in SC with how many people there are."
settmains,fffn9mx,t1_fffljsa,1579887620.0,"It's just a byproduct of sett bring easy as fuck to pick up and people being slow as fuck to deal with change and new things.

Sett requires you to do one thing. Not stand still. SOOOO many adcs love to just stand stock still and auto and home everything dies. 

So when sett has a massive line nuke it's stupid easy to just blow em up. Means even if you got stomped in lane you end up winning games cause the enemy doesn't get the simple fact that orb walking means you won't die 99% of the time."
funny,fffmfxq,t1_fffjx0l,1579887115.0,Now THAT needs more jpeg.
aww,ffflg07,t1_fff21p3,1579886509.0,It's skull is litterally the biggest part of it. It's amazing what not having shoulders does. Same with things like cats. If they can fit their head though the rest can fit as well.
settmains,fffl9l1,t1_fffjxdl,1579886397.0,It's almost as if sett isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread in top lane unlike what everyone seems to say.
settmains,fffj6l1,t1_fff20xq,1579885105.0,Another great one is fi. Fasty girl go poke poke then HAHA as you counter the one punch man serious serious punch!

pathofexile,ff9z3jn,t1_ff9c03d,1579724590.0,But it is a body suit. In fact you can wear it and it's an I'll fitting body suit.
pathofexile,ff9yo4w,t1_ff9clwg,1579724338.0,Example. My poor reach of the council rework got delayed this league ): I just want my fave now to be better ;=; but they had other things they had to do.
pathofexile,ff9rc2z,t1_ff9mwik,1579719393.0,Easier said then done as they are in New Zealand and I would assume most people are not native kiwis.... Even if you want to apply it's extreamly hard to actually go though with everything to do so and get approved.
settmains,ff9px73,t1_ff9kj27,1579718332.0,"Yeah, had a game yesterday agasint a rangar who knew exactly how sett worked it was impossible to land a W on him and my q basically did nothing to him as he could hit and run faster then I could get the second hit off. So I was just forever getting poked out."
settmains,ff9p451,t1_ff9mk99,1579717747.0,Yeah I was just playing devil's advocate if nothing else :P
settmains,ff9i8tl,t1_ff9232p,1579713583.0,Then you get ganked on repeat because you are pushed to their tower and your jungle is no where to been seen if not feeding mid lane for some reason. :D
settmains,ff9i341,t1_ff8wppn,1579713486.0,"Win rates right after release are always higher or lower then they will end up being cause people don't know how to play the champ or against.

The simpler a champ is the higher their starting win rate tends to be while more complicated champs tend to have slightly lower.

Which some expections. But setts just really easy to pick up but not everyone plays top or jungle so it will be a hot second before people learn to dodge his W.

Once people have the muscle memory to dodge his W setts actually pretty much fine if not a bit weak since so much of his power is in his W."

Showerthoughts,ff6dmdk,t1_ff69he3,1579624902.0,"Chance. Money buys you a chance. A chance is more then 99.9% of people get.

Sure you can bust your ass for 20 years to buy your self a chance. But even then it's not the same. That chance might as well be a spec on the boot heel of the chance big money with no strings attached gives."
AskReddit,ff68vwx,t1_ff5fd0w,1579621880.0,I think he meant the other kind of fuck 'er
AskReddit,ff68h82,t1_ff5qqk3,1579621615.0,In the us we also drive more on avg then you guys in the UK if I recall. So it likely balances out more then one would expect.
pathofexile,fez06tb,t1_feyxu3f,1579452642.0,"Even a crappy player given a good enough build can minimize or even stop dying. The problem is typically more about how you create design and build uo your character.

Then again some people are just that bad."
pathofexile,feyxz15,t1_feyi6q6,1579451822.0,"I don't know how anyone thinks a 4 link is remotely ok past the story nowadays.

5 link is barely ok for 90% of things late game. Everything is so massively tanky and does so much god damn damage nowadays.

If you arnt at least abusing a pseudo 5 link at a minimum I'm amazed how you manage to make it past white maps."

funny,feofc3r,t1_feochdx,1579299390.0,"I mean ignorance is a great tool to horror as a foundation even before hp. Which is why his closed off racist nature was such a great boon to him as a horror writer.

All of his work is just misunderstandings and concepts that ""are beyond the mortal mind"". In other words just ignorence of something greater.

I mean hell he has a story about air con that's entirely a thing because it was new and unknown. The unknown is scary.

HP was just crazy enough to turn that racist ignorence into story's."

Ignorance.

gaming,feo68ut,t1_fenzrwl,1579295689.0,"As someone who has actually measured the increase in power consumption of bdo while in tray mode I can say it is litterally less then 1% increase in total power consumption over idle on a 1800x. 

The game renders and calculators nothing. It's litterally just keeping a heartbeat alive so the server knows you are logged in.

It's not more stressful then having something like steams client turned on and minimized."
