ukpolitics,ff94nkt,t3_es6bjh,1579704745.0,"I want more MPs to be representative of our society, i.e. more female MPs and party leaders. More gay MPs. More BAME MPs. We're a diverse country and Parliament should reflect that.

But choosing a party leaders based *solely*, or *mainly*, on their gender (or race, sexuality, religion etc.) is a really bad idea.

Ensure MPs are made up of a diverse and representative group of people, and then pick the best person for the job of leader.

The idea of being ""woke"" (for lack of a phrase that doesn't make me cringe) is that people are treated equally and employed based upon their individual character and skills, not their gender or hair colour or favourite flavour of Panda Pop. This goes both ways, you shouldn't discriminate for or against the minority or majority based on factors beyond their control.

That said, I think this is probably more to do with wanting to get Starmer to step out rather than a genuine concern about female representation. This statement seems disingenuous at best."

I get it though if you were expecting something more like, well more like Pearl Jam!"
Music,ff8noht,t3_es7xne,1579687708.0,"I went into this with fairly low expectations, but I really like this track, probably because I'm a massive Talking Heads fan.

I think the track suffers a little from wearing it's influences on its sleeve. If you threw David Byrne on there and told me it was a forgotten track from the Remain in Light era I would probably believe you. You can only tell it's Pearl Jam from Eddie's vocals and the production.

But overall I like this track quite a bit and think it may grow on me more with repeated listens, it's cool to see PJ move into a completely new direction. Hope an album is coming along with more of this kinda stuff.

It gets boring and frustrating when these legendary bands just keep doing the same thing over and over again, this was really refreshing."

Guitar,feyqthj,t1_feydisf,1579449387.0,"That would still be in G.

G is the 1st note in the G major scale, and the I chord in the key of G major.

The chords in G major are:

G, Am, Bm,C, D, Em, F#dim

These are numbered in roman numerals respectively.

I, II, III, IV, V ,VI, VII

So your chord progression is known as a I, V, II progression. This can then be applied to any key.

So the exact same progression (a I, V, II progression) but transposed to the key of C major would be:

C, G, Dm

In terms of scales, start off using either the G major scale, or the g major pentatonic, which are the same notes as Em pentatonic but starting on the G. Once you nail that, go learn more theory."

CasualUK,femwsxy,t3_eppuq0,1579271662.0,"I know you've had two losses of loved ones and I want to be sensitive to that, but please be really careful with psychics.

Remember there is no scientific evidence of psychic abilities, and the techniques that they use (cold reading, suggestion techniques, the Forer effect etc.) can be very convincing even to sceptical people.

You can even buy books on how to appear psychic, it's a massive industry and it's intended to make **money**, NOT to make people feel better.

James Randi was famous for uncovering how so called psychics are actually just clever tricksters, if you have a look on YouTube there's a bunch of videos of him revealing how they're frauds.

If you're feeling better from your visit that's great, more power to you, but be careful not to keep forking money over to someone who is *very* likely (IMO certain) to be conning you. Grief makes people very susceptible to such things, as you will really, really *want* to communicate with those you've lost. People end up handing over more and more money to these ""psychics"" in order to feel better, despite there being absolutely no evidence that anyone has psychic abilities.

Do what makes you happy, and tell me to fuck off if you want, but please don't spend more than you can afford to get that ""one last message"", because it's almost certainly snake oil that you're buying."

You may as well ask ""What is the appeal of Ed Sheeran? It's just lazily written music using basic western music theory mixed with the occasional hip hop beat. It's all in 4/4, takes no risks, the lyrics are trite, and he uses many of the same chord progressions that he used on previous albums.""

Sometimes people want to hear something a bit more interesting, or something angry that makes them feel alive.

Some people just want a familar chord progression and lyrics about girls. And that's cool too, people like what they like.

I like Death Grips for the same reason I loved metal as a teenager, it's musically interesting and it's a cathartic way to release some pent up aggression. The lyrics are interesting and cryptic and you can read them over and over again to try and find new meanings, and once you get used to the noise element of their music there's actually a look of catchy hooks. In fact DG are one of the most accessible noise groups out there, these noise and industrial genres can get a LOT weirder than Death Grips."
