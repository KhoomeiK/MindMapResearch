Also most characters in books don’t talk or describe things like regular people-that would be annoying to read

But you didn’t say it felt like no one would talk like this- you said you could imagine it being a woman, but not a man.  

Which is sad because in your mind - perhaps just going off of narrators - you can’t imagine a man having these types of consistent, non-objectifying thoughts but can for a woman.

explainlikeimfive,ffv4fvi,t3_ev99yv,1580255436.0,"I think it depends on the type of homework, the amount, and how the teacher grades it.  I don’t think there is “no correlation” with academic success.

In fact, when I was teaching an accelerated course I wondered if the normal homework was too much.  So I gave the students a choice - that they had to choose in the first week.  Do the homework, which is 15% of the grade, or opt to not do the homework and the three unit exams were worth 5% more.  About half the students chose each option.  The “no homework” students did about 10% points lower for the course than the homework students.  

But all the homework I assign is related to the course, and I grade for correctness- so students get feedback on how to improve.  Others don’t.  I had a math teacher that assigned about 200 questions a week.  I struggled to complete all of them not because of content - most were the same type of questions but with variables changed- but for time.  So I’d get maybe 150 questions done before the due date..and did the hw on concepts a, b, and c....but didn’t have time to practice concept d.  Then I find out my teacher didn’t even check if they were correct, but merely done.

Because of time constraints or laziness (depends on the individual) more teachers are grading for completion instead of correctness, which can both give students a false impression of their comprehension (“how did I get a 50 on the test when I get 100s on all my homework?!”) as well as deprive them of formative feedback (eg getting homework back with all...I don’t know, 9x tables wrong and a note to work on that before a test)"

rollerderby,ffs2p76,t1_ffs1p8m,1580171665.0,"I also get the feeling some of it is gatekeeping.

When one fm said, “I don’t have that time”, “derby” apparently wasn’t for this skater,  not “this league”)

So I feel like being an asshole it also these people’s way of saying, “if you can’t, as almost fm, take a hit from a vet, derby isn’t for you”. Like I feel sometimes they want people to just be born to play derby and resent those who haven’t learned"

Like, for me, this post made me think of my first scrimmage.  It was my first ever scrimmage and someone on the opposite team who had about 10 years experience kept hitting me such that it knocked me off my feet in such a way I couldn’t even attempt to fall properly.  I kept falling on my wrist (to the extend i thought it was broken and my dr wouldn’t allow me to drive for a week) and she kept doing it.  She didn’t get a penalty, nevermind ejected because they were all “legal” hits.  But the thing is, I recall it was ALWAYS when I was in the back of the pack and the jammers were out of the pack - ie there was no reason for her to do these repeated hits because there was no offense or defense to play at the time and I had time to recover before they came back.  

“Excessive force” is incredibly broad, especially for such a sport as derby.  Even “unsportsmanlike” behavior is more rule violation (eg interrupting a pass, verbally abusing the other team, etc.)

These people are just using derby to be assholes, and using the reasoning of “it’s not illegal” to keep acting like an asshole"

But no, for everything it’s like “we’re going to launch this product and if people don’t like it as-is we’ll just let it linger for a few years then discontinue it

Documentaries,ff33hpa,t1_ff31zp7,1579532724.0,"Exactly.  BMI can be tricky.  I once had a hospital worker say,  “this bed scale is obviously wrong - sorry we’re going to have to make you walk to the one down the hall”. I asked what it read and said, “no, I weighed myself yesterday and the bed’s saying the same weight”

They couldn’t believe I was that heavy.  I got heavy bones and a fair amount of muscle (though covered in pudge) so I don’t actually look “obese” but nor do I look like “yeah that’s all muscle!” 

...and BMI as its currently calculated accounts for none of this.  I’m just “obese” according to BMI.

I know they’re not super precise, but mine at least seems accurate, but I’ve been using the scales with fat measurement.  It helps, because you’re right sometimes the scales goes down but you know it’s not because of anything healthy.  The weight and fat index gives me two numbers to work with."

If you don’t want to do that now, understandable, but if you do want to go out in the future you can take steps to control portions even when out"
nottheonion,ff32e98,t1_ff2vpo1,1579531888.0,"Exactly.  I got shit on by a job so I left.  The other job was worse - they were scheduling me at times I couldn’t work every week-  so i called the first job and asked for my job back.  They said I could have it, but at the same salary and position.  I said thank you, but I’d need a raise and higher position.  They said no.

....less than a week later they called me and said “okay, better salary and position”.  I accepted and told my current job.  They flipped out, wondering what they could do to keep me - they offered me a raise and schedule review.

The reason for that?  I a fucking hard worker.  Most people don’t appreciate what they have until it’s gone, or about to be.  

And this was in fucking retail when I was like 18, so I don’t understand how people can’t apply that to better jobs with true upward mobility.

And that’s not to say every job is like this - my third job was awesome - I worked hard and every year saw a jump in my paycheck.  My boss just gave me raises and shifts he knew I deserved. 

So anyway.  Hard work can get you advancement in your job."

Christ I know this is annoying but the fact y’all keep rallying against an actual term - to the point of making up terms - is stupid.

Women and girls are females.  Boys and men are males.  Getting riled up because someone uses that term is LETTING them take a normal word and turn it into an insult.
