But her main neurological issues are from neospora (a parasitic infection that attacks the brain and spinal cord) and toxoplasmosis - unfortunately she was left untreated for some time before coming to rescue so some of the damage is permanent. She's been thru treatment and is on daily meds for support, but her balance and coordination will always be a little off."

(don't worry, she's been thru every treatment possible and she's not in pain from it). She is an Anatolian Shepherd mix."

tippytaps,feedf67,t1_feeccd7,1579031464.0,Anatolian Shepherd and Great Pyrenees mix. Not a fair representation of either breed tho due to her health issues.
