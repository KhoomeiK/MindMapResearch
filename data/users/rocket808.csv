IAmA,fedwsjb,t1_fedqtmb,1579021543.0,"It was a decade ago so I don't remember exactly, but in the neighborhood of $250 a day, plus a ""transportation"" fee. Price also depended on how nice they were about it when they called. The vast majority of people were cool and glad we took good care of their car, I don't remember anyone ever freaking out about the cost.

People with busted cars would do the same thing, but they usually would come get the car the next day. If it was someone with a 10-year-old piece of shit with bald tires and a broken window, we would be cool about it. Being broke sucks."

IAmA,fecvm5h,t1_fecec8d,1578986388.0,"I owned a valet company in Los Angeles. People valet their mega-cars all the time. For cars that expensive only managers or myself were allowed to take them. It was nerve wracking parking someone else's +$500k car. 

Semi-regularly people would just leave their Rolls-Royce or Lamborghini with us because they got trashed and ubered home or something. Sometimes it would be a week or more before they even called us to find out where their car was. 

Imagine having the kind of money where it takes you a week to realize you are missing one of your quarter-million plus dollar cars.  ""Honey, have you seen the blue Ferrari anywhere lately?...No, I mean the other blue Ferrari..."""
