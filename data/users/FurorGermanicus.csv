Don't focus on the scale/weight. Cardio might be the fastest way to lise weight but you lose a lot of muscle, too which happens to be more dense. 

Muscle weighs heavier and that is why you lose faster weight on a calorie restricted diet + cardio regimen."

If you're working out your body gets much wore insulin sensitive. Cardio burns literally up your carb stores and boosts insulin sensitivity.

I usually stick to lifting weights with a little bit of cardio."

AmItheAsshole,fdylwr1,t1_fdykg5f,1578781240.0,"See my other post. I never said a vegan diet is a bad choice per se or bad for the individual. 

But do us all a favor and stop comparing pro athletes with regular & natural folks, claiming they can get as big and strong by going vegan.

If anything it is much easier and less complicated to build and maintain strength and muscle by eating a well balanced and varied diet, than artificially restricting yourself by avoiding animal products entirely."
AmItheAsshole,fdyj22g,t1_fdyg5tc,1578780307.0,"Not losing muscle is a fair point. I didn't say that a vegan diet is a bad choice per se.

My point is, that you need a good (better) understanding about nutrition and your body needs when you restrict your diet and eliminate several (most) good groups. 

And just because guys like Patrick are vegans and strong as fuck, doesn't mean you're going to be strong (or jacked) as fuck, too. 

Hell, even if you include meat or animal products, you probably won't get as swole as your typical meat eating (semi) pro athlete, as there is much more to it than just food selection."

Comparing Average Joe's with professional athletes (that most certainly use anabolic steroids and other enhancing drugs of some sort to achieve and maintain their phyisiques) is also hilarious."

Also, most vegan bodybuilders / weightlifters didn't start out as vegans. It's a lot harder to build strength and muscle, than it is to retain it. These guys also know a lot about nutrition, their needs and bodys and use a shitload of supplements (and probably other enhancing drugs).

So what is your point?"

gaming,fdc0o1e,t1_fdbpzja,1578264841.0,"Well, I experienced both in my childhood (and some other ones, as well) and while I also enjoyed the N64 (Ocarina of Time / Golden Eye, anyone?), I have to say that the SNES had subjectively and objectively the better games. Or more precisely: It had a lot more of 'the good stuff'. 

Also, the console market wasn't as splintered as it got later on, so it is no wonder that the SNES had a lot great games to offer. 

Graphically speaking, I would always prefer good 2D pixelart instead of ugly 3D polygons  (and let's be honest, some games didn't age that well, while a lot of SNES games still look beautiful)."
