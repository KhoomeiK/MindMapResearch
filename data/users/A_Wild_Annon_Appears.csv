socialanxiety,fer2j56,t1_feqqdrr,1579348898.0,I agree. Nurturing is so important. It's also really important to not hide from your flaws but acknowledge them and combat the issue. I've learnt this pretty late in life as I've been hiding from them for a long time but with practice you will improve. You can't be the type of person that says it's societies fault for neglecting us. You have to take responsibility sometimes.
socialanxiety,fer1tma,t3_eq9aem,1579348599.0,Teachers need to be taught to tackle shy students with more tact. I believe that getting shy students involved at a young age will help improve their social anxiety but you can't just be throwing them in the deep end to fix their problems.
NoFap,fer0r04,t3_eq1bn9,1579348285.0,"True. Nofap can be beneficial for people to regain control of their life and to start doing more positive thing like working out and doing more productive things but people treat it like a miracle cure. 

People are desperate to cure their anxiety or depression and meet women and a lot of the posts imply its a cure but it isn't. Most of it is just a positive reinforcement or placebo effect. If you have the ability to stop yourself from faping then you make yourself believe you have more confidence which is a good thing if it works for you. 

Some people even go to the extent where they say they have seen muscle growth, women approaching them etc but it's likely the muscle growth is just because they started going to the gym and the girls approaching are because you carry yourself with more confidence. 

People are also so insistent that you must obtain from faping for as many days as possible but in truth you have to evaluate your own state of mind and fix the problems from the source. I used nofap to really reflect on my flaws and grow. I don't beat myself up over relapse because I don't see this 90 day mark as a magical time where all my flaws will be cured. 

Each to their own I guess."
NoFap,fen1ikr,t1_felzt40,1579274882.0,Is it guilt or your body feeling like shit?
NoFap,fek15qb,t1_fek0gwy,1579190387.0,"I respect those people a lot but the main problem was my lack of focus when I have exams coming up. After they are done I'll give it another go. With more restraint then twice a day, it will probably easier when I try again."
socialanxiety,fegvlij,t3_ep3ve0,1579103522.0,Not too familiar to with that service but I would say be careful and do your research at the very least. Taking the wrong medication could be harmful so don't let your current feeling effect your long term health.
socialanxiety,feg09tf,t3_eox0q1,1579071475.0,Some quality stuff here. I can relate to the posture thing a lot. Being able to look ahead rather then towards the ground when your walking in public helps reinforce the idea that no one is really concerned about what you are doing. Gives you a sense of confidence.
socialanxiety,feejjs9,t3_eoixl0,1579035040.0,Bold of you to assume I have friends.
socialanxiety,fe7ao7d,t3_enw3su,1578912140.0,I could see how my social anxiety developed since when I was young. For me it went from shyness to being self conscious about my weight from a very young age. I had friends who I could speak to comfortably but never really pushed outside my comfort zone and since then my comfort zone has gotten smaller and smaller. Need to make an active decision to fix this now.
socialanxiety,fe79xn4,t3_eo1tem,1578911927.0,Need to do some self reflection. Look at the situations when you feel like that and think about why. Think about how you act in those situations and find a way to push out of your comfort zone in small steps.
socialanxiety,fe79m0z,t3_eo1wg7,1578911767.0,With this level of info it looks really sketchy to be honest. Stuff like this would be better suited to a Facebook group or with more info and a way to guarantee its safe. If it's not a registered company or university run experiment of some sort then it really doesn't make sense to be here.
socialanxiety,fe78gx3,t3_ens8i8,1578911398.0,"That's interesting. With my social anxiety I find it a lot easier to turn those kind of people away because the situation puts me on edge and I just block them out when I know what they want.

Was in a simar situation with a small women when I left the train station. I just said I haven't got any and crossed the road. The risk of being mugged or being put into a vulnerable position is too much for me so I just don't engage in any talk with them even though it's not about whether I'm physically stronger than whose asking for the money."
NoFap,fe36nad,t3_enp7rb,1578846505.0,Me too. Day 1 and 2 were difficult but day 3 is surprisingly easy.
socialanxiety,fe0dusy,t3_enk1ld,1578811236.0,"In my experience, performing in front of lots of people you don't know is better than fewer people who do. Good luck."
NoFap,fdy7uka,t3_end27u,1578776957.0,Go to the about section. Trying this thing out for as a sort of experiment and to get in a better mental state. Coming up to 3 days now.
socialanxiety,fdpuqjb,t3_emn324,1578641285.0,"Take little steps. Think about something you would do at home when your comfortable like taking a sip of water or taking off your coat or stretching out your legs and try to do one of those things everyday in class. You will realise no one is looking at you and that it's actually pretty easy to be comfortable in class over time. 

You need to get yourself out of that autopilot putting you in stiff positions so doing one thing you wouldn't normally do in class will lead to progression which will motivate you to be more like yourself in these kind of situations."
socialanxiety,fdoih17,t3_emftkv,1578605812.0,"I would say take your time. There's no quick fix with social anxiety so the presentation won't be perfect. Give yourself time to breath. Just remember everything will feel much better once you've completed it and use it as a learning experience. 

I'm sure your class mates understand how scary it can be presenting in front of the class so just go and attempt it. For your friend, for us and for a valuable learning experience."
lonely,f1ay95p,t3_d8c920,1569313848.0,"Thank you all for sharing your experiences and advice. Knowing other people are going through the same thing make me feel I'm not alone even though it felt like I was. I'm going to take things one step at a time and try not to overthink things. 

For everyone going through similar things, just want to let you know that you're not alone. Let's keep at it"
