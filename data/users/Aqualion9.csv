college,ffdfw1x,t1_ffd6ms5,1579820022.0,"I applied to about 10 internships freshman year and didn’t get any. I didn’t realize how hard it was for first years, but just keep trying. In the end it worked out for me because of networking. Maybe contact your school’s alumni office so you can get in tough with people who are doing jobs related to what you plan on doing. It helps if you work for someone who went to your college b/c you will have people who have some sort of connection to you. At least that’s what I did and I learned a lot that summer. Good luck!"
pens,ff4qygd,t3_eriv64,1579570319.0,This was my favorite pen until my friend got me into fountain pens. Still my favorite rollerball though.
college,ff265kn,t1_ff24qpz,1579494901.0,"Last year when I was living in a freshman dorm the guys who lived below me were like that. Idk where they are now but now it’s nice and quiet in my building. Also last year I had to study elsewhere on campus b/c of them. It turned out fine though, I found some great study spots."

If you are saying only people with XXFX has the agreeableness traits or everyone who is XNFJ and XXXP is open, then you are wrong. Also not everyone with Te is angry all the time and likewise people with low Te can be angry sometimes, lol.

Edit: I swam when I was younger and enjoyed it a lot. Especially racing others. :)"

iOSBeta,fedatps,t1_fecf6x1,1579006014.0,I didn’t know they roll out new updates slowly. That probably explains why my iPhone gmail app has dark mode but the gmail app on my iPad doesn’t have dark mode. All this time I was thinking it was just impossible for them to implement dark mode on iPad OS. Hmmmm

college,fc5er6g,t3_eg9cbj,1577455432.0,"Like the other person said, make sure to eat before lab. My labs for bio were 4 hours long twice a week and my chem labs were four hours long once a week. If I didn’t eat lunch before hand, that would have been a recipe for disaster. Also are you allowed to sit down? Since you said you’re getting dizzy, make sure to go into lab fully hydrated. I know a lot of my friends don’t drink enough water daily and that affects them."
Professors,fc4mt93,t3_eg2l32,1577421360.0,"I know this sub is for professors but I like to read through it because that’s what I’m thinking for my career.
Anyways, in my biology class last semester, we had a short 5 point quiz each class. It took about 5-10 minutes and the class met twice a week for an hour and a half (and 1 hour for discussion). The quizzes didn’t cover everything but it only had some material from the previous day. They were usually one question that required a short paragraph or a diagram for the answer. I think it really helped with my understanding of the material. My professor told us that the quizzes were meant to help the students learn what they didn’t know and that they aren’t meant to drastically influence the grade. That being said, the quizzes equaled about half a test in terms of point value. Also, the two lowest scores were dropped. 
For your second question, my friends and I studied in a group and went over everything for the final. So, some students will study everything and some won’t."
