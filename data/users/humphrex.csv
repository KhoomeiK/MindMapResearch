Signets are just a bomb. After finally adding them my cube got 200% better. Id run 20 of them.
playing paupercube for 7 years btw ;) that said, you run some really awful cards in yours, especially white and red and too many duals. an easy cut for signets. also its not even 360 and a total mess."
mtgcube,fden3vo,t1_fctoqs4,1578342508.0,Gush is pretty solid in paupercube though. And Signets are just great.
