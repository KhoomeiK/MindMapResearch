It is considered a mega city because its metro population is over 10 million, and is, depending on the definition, the second or third largest metropolitan area in Europe (Moscow is first, Paris and London exchange places depending on how they’re measured, and sometimes Istanbul is included but is only half in Europe)."
GenZ,ff8e3oz,t1_ff8ajxt,1579674629.0,"I definitely feel closer to a 29 year old, but your experience may well be different. I feel like my 21 year old self was noticeably more immature than my 25 year old self. You probably have more personal development between 20 and 25 than at any other point in your adult life. There’s a reason 25 is commonly seen as the point when you’re fully ‘grown up’ - your brain has finished developing and you begin making better life choices.

I feel like your late teens and early 20s are the figuring yourself out stage."

My mum was in the same room and started screaming for my grandma as I started pacing around with my heart almost beating through my chest. It eventually passed but I was more scared than I had ever been in my entire life because for a moment I genuinely thought this was it. 

For about a year after that I became nervous about eating anything nutty or crunchy. I wouldn’t swallow pills and crushed them up because the thought of swallowing them made me feel physically ill. I can swallow them normally now and have gone back to eating crunchy foods but having a choking experience really messes with your head and makes you scared to eat almost anything for a while."
BikiniBottomTwitter,ff71ml7,t3_ern9z2,1579639329.0,San Francisco has gentrified significantly over the past 15 years and low-income neighbourhoods have vanished rapidly to the point that working class people virtually don’t exist in the city. I really don’t understand how a city with so much wealth can have such an issue with homelessness. Where do they all come from? Are they moving there from elsewhere because the weather is mild?

I’ve always been a homebody and feel happiest in the comfort of my own living room. I also never feel fully safe when I’m surrounded by loads of drunk people - the atmosphere just feels a little unsettling, like trouble could break out at any moment. But that’s also probably a reflection of where I live because people here don’t just get a little drunk on nights out, they lose all sense of control.

Plus I work full time like most 25 year olds. I feel like going out all the time is something you do in college and gradually just stop when you graduate."

Championship,ff3u4o7,t1_ff3sp4x,1579548898.0,"Liverpool have a 16-point gap and haven’t lost a single league game in over a year. They’ve been favourites to win the league since day one and are still pumping out results. It isn’t even remotely comparable because we are nowhere near that good and never have been. If they somehow ended up 2nd or lower then they’d have bottled it spectacularly. If they were 6th at Christmas but 13th by May they wouldn’t have bottled anything because they were never in serious contention to win anything. That could even describe Liverpool circa 2010.

Leicester aren’t contenders for the league so I don’t see the relevance."
Championship,ff3s3vc,t1_ff3odbz,1579547652.0,"If you‘re consistently shit for the second half of the season then you didn’t bottle anything because you were never serious promotion contenders. We were favourites for promotion all the way through the 2nd half of last season and completely choked in the playoffs which is why the bottling thing makes sense.

I know everyone loves shitting on us but for the past decade we’ve just been a bang-average mid table team."
Championship,ff3n2s4,t1_ff2tf92,1579544573.0,"Being in the top 6 for a bit and then falling off is hardly bottling promotion, otherwise several teams this season have already bottled promotion because 3rd-6th have constantly changed. I don’t think we’ve ever done well in the playoffs and no Leeds fan realistically expects us to go up that way. It’s automatics or nothing.

We were in the top two for most of last season and blew it at the last minute. That is the textbook definition of bottling it.

Also, complaining about people downvoting you makes you look like a fanny. Here’s another downvote for being a whiny dickhead."
LeedsUnited,ff3ljuj,t3_er9fek,1579543624.0,"Oh fuck off. They’re shit and they know it. That isn’t our fault. Most of these players were finishing 15th a couple of seasons ago, I’m not surprised they crumble at the first sign of any pressure. It’s just not good enough. Do you think they’re the only team in the world who get called shit?

Bielsa has done the best he can with them, if we want to go up we need better players. That’s just a fact. If the current players can’t handle the expectations or pressure of a big club trying to secure promotion then they need to go."

I’ll just sit happily in my middle class metropolitan bubble. Why should I care if the rest of the country rots when they’ve made it perfectly clear they don’t care about me? 

And don’t kid yourself - you want to ‘leave immigration alone’ and the result of that is allowing the Tories to whip up anti-immigrant hysteria while doing absolutely fuck all to challenge it. Immigrants and their children have to live with the consequences of that. That is absolutely throwing them under the bus. This runs a hell of a lot deeper than just being able to move freely within Europe."

AskReddit,fewkshf,t1_fevw2uj,1579412937.0,"Nah, the Sims 3 is poorly optimised and very demanding on even high-end PCs - it might be okay with just the base game but as soon as you start adding more content it craps out. The game recommends you play with no more than 4 expansion packs at a time because of how laggy it is. What’s the point of all those expansion packs if you can’t even use them all at once without major performance issues? 

Oh, and the Sims 3 is a 32-bit game so doesn’t respond well to modern PCs. They never optimised it for 64-bit. 

I’d say the Sims 3 is the best in terms of the amount of content you get but by far the worst in terms of performance. When you have an open world with every single lot pre-loaded and every single item having custom styles that all need to be loaded individually every time you enter a new lot, it’s not surprising it’s so resource-intensive."
