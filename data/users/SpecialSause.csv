If it's a machine, maybe it has instructions for specific conditions and those conditions haven't been created yet and it's just on standby.

I read  a theory that maybe the Traveler was a collective of souls.  Maybe an entire race of beings stored their souls into a machine and all of the souls collectively controlled the machine.  The ghosts are the release of those souls.  Somewhere in the grimoire it talks about the ghosts have vague memories of being ripped from others and then waking up.  If that's true, maybe there's no souls to control the machine or not enough left to control it.

People here like to praise Democrats but the party sucks.  You can listen to Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren explain why we can't have universal health care.  I think Warren has changed her tune but she was saying it can't happen while simultaneously taking millions from private health insurance companies.  Harris was trying to have single mothers arrested their children being delinquent at school.  

There seems to be this ""any blue will do"" but there's a lot of ""blues"" out there that keep saying we can't have universal health care.

I still disagree.  Ask almost any Erentil user if they'll grab a non-high impact frame fusion rifles just because Backup Plan is gone and I doubt you'll have many takers.  I had a BP Erentil sitting in my vault for quite a while before I even tried it.  For me, Backup Plan took some practice to get use to it so I didn't really use it in the beginning.  I still prefer not to have it proc at longer distances because it's not as effective (or at least I'm not as effective with it).

I've been using Fusions in crucible almost exclusively since D2Y1.  I'm fairly good with fusion rifles and O wouldn't change frames for the loss of BP. 

Our of sheer curiosity I asked my clan if anyone uses fusion rifles in crucible and if they'd change to a non-high impact frame if Backup Plan were to disappear on them to get back up plan back?  The people in my clan said ""no"".

He's not doing anything illegal or technically illegal but it's making other employees super uncomfortable. I would want the option to tell this person that I no longer want to employ them. 

It's doesn't even have to be malicious.  Maybe the person you employed clashes with your company personality-wise.  Maybe it's just not a good fit.

The machines I run are highly specialized and have been fitted with robotic arms.  Due to the robots, I maintain 7 machines.  It's a lot of work to maintain, adjust, and keep up paper work for 7 machines.  I bust my ass every day.  The other people in my department work but they are giving about 60% while I constantly give above 90% everyday.  I pride myself on that fact.

I recently found out that while I am the longest employed person on my shift, I am also the lowest paid due to the company increasing starting pay but not raising everyone else's already working there.  There's 2 guys in particular that I work with that started at the beginning of 2019 that are making more than I am and they still have 2 more starting raises (my company does raises at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, and then a merit increase every year after).  I wouldn't have known this if someone hadn't told me.  

I just got my merit increase and I was given 2.75%.  When I asked why, I was told that everyone got 2.75%  So how is that a merit increase?  My company for everyone working there by doing this that it didn't matter if you're a star employee busting for ass or a guy don't the bare minimum because you'll get the same raise regardless.  And to that fact, I am now considering running 1 machine like everyone else and doing the bare minimum like everyone else.

This just happened and it was a punch in the gut.  I'm devastated.  I love my job and it's why I bust my ass but I refuse to bust my ass and work a 2 person job while being paid the least.

All of my knowledge comes third, fourth, fifth, tenth hand.  What I see when fighting is only observed as an outsider.  We can say ""Griffin's performance was terrible.""  However, we've never actually fight let alone fight a fighter like Anderson Silva.  So there's going to be a lot of stuff we're going to miss by simply not having experienced it.  That fact alone is the reason I rarely ever attempt to express that I know what I'm talking about when it comes fighting.  I just prefer to listen to other fighters' opinions.

It the same deal with SAS saying Cowboy quit.  He's a non-fighter with zero experience talking about a sport he knows little about.  I had no idea who SAS was before the cowboy/Conor fight but it really turned me off to him when he's arguing with actual fighters that participate in a sport he barely pays attention to."

DestinyTheGame,fgfgug5,t1_fgewyex,1580738350.0,"I'm in agreement here.  I don't understand all the complaining about FOMO.  People have been asking for Destiny to add more MMO characteristics.  Guess what, the most successful MMORPG (WoW) had lots of ""FOMO"" moments.  Opening the gates at AQ, getting the Scarab Lord title with the Scarab mount you could use outside of AQ, World Boss events, etc.  If you started playing WoW now there are many items, armor, titles, weapons, etc., that you can no longer obtain.

I'm not necessarily in favor of against ""FOMO"".  Although personally I like having things that later players can't have because it's a form of bragging rights as well as a story to tell newer players.  

D1 had an emblem that they gave to players that played crucible and became infected with ""disease"" (if I remember correctly) during the Owl Sector event.  If you didn't play crucible in those weeks leading up to the event you didn't get the emblem.  Nobody complained then.

I'm not telling people not to be upset over ""FOMO"".  I just don't understand it, personally.  If you have fun playing D2, play D2.  If you don't enjoy it, don't play it.  Do people really play games they don't enjoy to obtain a digital item?  If I didn't enjoy D2, there's no way I'm grinding for anything in this game.  

Don't play games to obtain items you can't get later.  Play them because you enjoy playing them."

AskReddit,ffxeenb,t1_ffxab9n,1580323458.0,"There's been several sports where male-to-female transgender individuals have competed in women's sports only for records to be completely broken by a lot.  Also, there was an instance of a male-to-female transgendered person fight a woman in MMA without disclosing the fact that she use to be male.  It was hard to watch.  It was a horrific fight.  I have no issue with male-to-female transgender individuals fighting in MMA and no issue with them fighting women but that fact needs to be disclosed and the women need to make that decision.  The women are fighting a woman that had had the added benefit of having testosterone for 20 to 30+ years that the natural (not sure what the correct terminology is) female didn't.

I'm not anti-trans.  In fact, I am of the belief that as an adult you should be able to do whatever you want as long as you're not hurting anyone else.  Transgender people included.  Although I did feel we should probably start making transgender leagues for sports.
