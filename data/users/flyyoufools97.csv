And if the value of the stock goes down, and the dividend stays the same, the percentage will be higher, but you'll lose money from the falling stock."

stocks,fgt4za4,t1_fgt48d3,1581099159.0,"My opinion of it is that most of it is pure hype.  Most of it probably won't ever come to fruition. The main business will probably still be cars, and for it to justify a 1 trillion dollar market cap it would have to literally be the only car manufacturer left in the market.  It has come to the point where car manufacturers will either have to adapt or become extinct, and I seriously doubt they'll let their companies die. 

I'm not shorting or buying it, probably ever. But best of luck to you my friend."

television,fgt06nj,t1_fgszkij,1581096304.0,"The only other representation Vietnamese people get on here is either viciously murdering Americans or being viciously murdered by them. 

I know it's a war movie and all, but you have to admit it makes Vietnam look hilarious.  How stereotypical is it that an Asian man steals your camera, does a crazy karate chop, and then jumps onto a motorcycle. What kind of criminal does that?

And I don't think the Vietnamese government sees it in the same light as you.  

I also don't agree with their choice to remove it, but like I said before, it is definitely understandable."
television,fgsz5kl,t1_fgsyvf0,1581095688.0,"No no, I definitely wouldn't defend it, but it _is_ understandable.  

The US's entire thesis is based on freedom of speech so I don't think any of this would fly there. I believe in free speech, but I understand where Vietnam is coming from. It's humiliating."
