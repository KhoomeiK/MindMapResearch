thatHappened,ffg7fyx,t1_fffz93d,1579900088.0,I'm not so sure. I mean for sure some of this stuff is made up and some of it isn't I'm just not so sure it's easy to tell which is which. I still have a lot of people on my FB from my home town and some of them say some pretty wild shit from time to time. They are also all universally uneducated so their writing styles are all over the place. Compound all of that with the fact that in the current political climate people have gotten really brave about what they are willing to put out there and you start to see insane ass posts like this.

I grew up pretty remote and in my opinion there are certain things about living that way that are safer. The most dangerous thing in the world is a human. When you are in a city they are all around you and you have no way of knowing who's unstable because most people are normal for the most part. Out in the sticks you mostly just have to worry about wildlife which will for the most part avoid you at all costs anyway. Just got to remember to be careful because if you get hurt out there help is a lot further away. I live in a city now and I love it, but if I had to pit one against the other I would say I am less safe here than out in the country."

Envy apples are bomb too if you are more in the mood for a not quite sour. What's the word I'm looking for? Tangy maybe? Someone help me out. But they are very crisp and juicy as well. I recently bought some ""autumn harvest"" apples and they were also AMAZING.

She is a great speaker and replacing Trump with a powerful woman would send a huge fuck you to the right. And then on the Sanders side he is just so damn genuine its hard not to believe in him. I will cast my vote to anyone who gets the nomination including Biden. Happily. Conservatives don't know what's coming in my opinion. Especially if Sanders snags the nomination. Warren too honestly. If she gets it, it won't matter the whole party will unite behind her. To get a blue wave you need two things, Republicans to piss everyone off which will draw out protest voters or someone that excites the party enough to get people to vote.

We're all in on this. I'm not sure about how progressive Warren REALLY is but if she stepped in to run as VPOTUS then for me it would erase all doubt. She'd be putting her name on Sanders policy. If he had a successful presidency and accomplished even 20 percent of what he wants to accomplish, and THEN Warren became president and started back tracking it would be political suicide.

This is all a pipe dream right now. They both want that progressive spot going into the primaries and at this point the deck is pretty much shuffled. We will see how the cards are dealt.

Of course I don't want to sit through a 5 hour movie in a theater!

Tarantino has said that he will release full cuts of both of those films at some point, and to me that says that in his opinion the material is good but he had to sacrifice it for run time. I don't think Tarantino would release a long version of one of his films if he thought it was shitty.

So I made the dumbest/best decision I ever would make and I enlisted into the mighty mighty USMC. Semper Fidelis. Though a dumb decision by any metric for a 26 year old, I gave not a fuck.

The end kind of led the viewer to have a shocking gasp and say ""It was Clinton all along!"" which is entirely possible because he's an immensely powerful person. I just think there should be equal shade thrown at Trump. He is equally likely to have had Epstein killed. If there is one person in the entire world that can have a high profile inmate in federal custody murdered and have the story buried it seems obvious to me that a sitting US president would have that power. He has the double whammy: everything to gain and everything to lose.

The answer is way too fucking many. Register to vote. Vote in your primary. Vote in midterm elections. Vote in local elections. Vote in any elections. If you can vote in an election, then vote.

If everyone who talked like this actually went out and voted in primary elections then the numbers would be too significant to ignore. If the DNC pulled a fast one at that point, then it would really highlight what the problem is wouldn't it? As we stand voter turnout by young people is so low during primaries that the DNC can do whatever they want.

I'm not saying you don't already vote in primary elections, but when you talk like this it spreads the idea that votes don't matter. Especially among the young. They fucking matter. When all Democrats show up to vote, we win elections. If we all showed up every time, it would be a very different country politically. Even in the south. Vote. Protest with your vote.

NatureIsFuckingLit,fdi4mt9,t3_elfihm,1578435655.0,"Fun fact about owls. If they clamp on something sometimes (read most of the time) they will lock their talons closed. They do this so that they aren't using muscles to constantly keep hold of something, and if one were to say land and clamp around your wrist (very unlikely but if it did happen) then it would be a minute before you could get them off. Even if you shook and screamed and threw a fit and even if they tried to fly away they would be stuck for a minute. I don't know the mechanism they use to unclamp but I learned this at a nature conservatory that had a rescue barn owl and the old man that would bring him out would demonstrate this by pretending to send the owl into the crowd and it would look like it was trying to fly towards us but because his talons were locked he would just flap his wings and remain locked to the handler. He was a cool old man."
USMC,fdg4xic,t1_fdg1oxr,1578380170.0,"Joining the Marine Corps is a service. You don't owe anything back to it regardless of whether or not you get rich and famous after. Some guys do it, others don't. Some guys get out and exclusively wear veteran brands and operator hats and make it their identity, some leave the past in the past. Neither group is wrong. The thing they have in common is they were part of the gun club. Joining the Corps does change you, but just joining the service IS the service. You don't owe the Corps or any other Marine a damn thing once you get that dd-214. Most people never leave their hometown or do anything selfless for their entire lives, and there's nothing wrong with that either, but that's what makes signing that contract special.

Just as some people are set up for success in the service, other people come out of it with fucked up bodies or fucked up minds and it literally kills them. I enjoyed my time in. I didn't leave fucked up or damaged (not significantly anyway) but I did my four years and now it's behind me. I still enjoy talking to other Marines and I really enjoy talking to older Marines but the bottom line is none of us owe anything else to lady liberty. I appreciate the lessons I learned in the Corps, and I REALLY appreciate the people I served with. For me that's enough. If you feel like you need to give back, by all means give back.

I don't think it's okay to be racist towards anyone. Period. Full stop. When I wrote the original sarcastic remark I was thinking of the incident I had two days ago where I was told that I should embrace white colonialism because without the white man I'd still be in the dark ages apparently according to that expert. No thanks. Without the white man a lot more of my ancestors would have survived. There are WHOLE TRIBES of indegenous nations that are EXTINCT because white colonials wiped them off the face of the earth. A whole culture. People that lived for thousands of years with their own language, culture, and problems of their own lost to history because of manifest destiny. I implore you if you feel strongly about racism then see what you can do about it in your area. If you're like me and you really don't have time to do much about it personally, then look into local organizations that can help and do work towards correcting it and consider donating what you can when you can.

My clearly marked sarcastic remark was to point out that when there's a rough history of colonialism in any given place you can't be surprised when the Natives don't give you a warm reception. White people wrote the book on racism then when it happens to them they grab the pitchforks. Yet when an NFL player takes a knee to stand up to it... They also grab the pitchforks. When cops kill unarmed black men all over the country they start putting thin blue line stickers on their cars and taking up for police. If you want to take a stand against racism take a stand against all racism. Have you ever experienced racism? As a Cherokee I have. I experienced a little racism 2 days ago when a white man told me that I should be thanking them for coming here and making everything better.

Do you make her a better person? If you can check all those boxes it's at least a good sign. The only thing I'll challenge here is mom isn't always right.

AskReddit,fd1d6n1,t1_fd1afpq,1578130082.0,"In my opinion a lot of it has to do with freedom of expression. You are free to express yourself and be as creative as you want here for the most part. It doesn't mean you won't get bullied or fucked with for it unfortunately, but it does mean that if someone has a goal or an idea here nobody is going to stand in their way for the most part. 

Now that goes both ways, and you're also free to express yourself as an idiot as well if that's what you want to do. I don't think I have to say much more for you to get what I mean by that.

Another major factor is that a lot of brilliant American minds aren't strictly American. There are large immigrant populations here and those people are free to express themselves as well. Unfortunately it is getting harder by the day to immigrate to America so unless we change that you will see less and less of that in years to come as those people go be brilliant in other countries even if they want to live here.

My final point is a comparison. The opposite of what I'm talking about is a place like China. Or Russia but we'll use China as the example. In places like that expression isn't so free, and you may get snatched up by the government if they feel you are too expressive. Now China has brilliant scientists too make no mistake, but the point I'm trying to make is that they would probably have a lot more if people were allowed to express themselves however they wanted. This has an effect on everything from art to science.

Don't get me wrong America is not as exceptional as we try to make ourselves out to be, it's just that a lot of brilliant people choose to live here and brilliant people are generally good at sticking to their goals, and in America that can really get you places (sometimes)."

I've never played a stadium or anything crazy like that but I have played for around 400 people and it was easy compared to playing solo in front of 5 or so.

Really helped when we started playing out because I don't think I could have went out there and stood for 2 hours if I hadn't already practiced that way. Another good bit of advice about playing sober is that if you always practice sober, don't get drunk or high when you finally get a gig.

Towards the end (I don't play out anymore at the time being) I realized that I played a hell of a lot better when I was sober. Even when I felt like I was doing terrible, the recordings don't lie. One hundred percent of the time I was sober, my playing was better for it. I don't have much advice because stage fright took a long time to get over for me but there wasn't any one thing. HOWEVER, playing with other people vastly improved my music skills especially in the timing department. It also takes the heat off of any one person, either we all suck or none of us do. And lastly, start small. If you have people over play a few songs for them.

And then at some point you realize you are just dealing with the grief in a different way. Then you realize that EVERYONE has a different way of dealing with loss and you kind of understand people a little better. Not sure why I'm writing this other than to tell you specifically that for ME it got better. Time was the factor. I still have some kind of weird callousness to death but I'm a lot better about opening up now and my head is in a much better place generally. I can't give you a time frame, I can't give you a recipe, but I can say that it's okay to grieve. It's okay to grieve alone, it's okay to grieve with a friend or relative, it's okay to get angry and not grieve. All you can do is push on."
LifeProTips,fcmdyc7,t1_fcm8ijg,1577771811.0,"That's not really fair to responsible gun owners. I am a gun owner, but I also fully support a major overhaul of gun regulations. At the same time there are places here where it's simply required to own a firearm. If you live in Montana 4 hours from the nearest town you basically have to have a firearm. Even if there's only a one percent chance some psycho kicks in your door to murder your family, if you don't have a gun in that situation you're as good as dead. The police are 4 hours away maybe 2 of you're lucky so calling them in places like that is going to be because something already has happened most of the time."
LifeProTips,fcmdfj4,t1_fclpbkw,1577771326.0,"When I was a kid I had a best friend I used to hang out with a lot. My dad and uncle taught me how to shoot and handle weapons from a very early age as we lived in the sticks. My friend was not so learned on the subject AND his dad had actually died in a firearm related accident. I'm not sure the precise details of what happened but I do know that it was his dads fault (as in he accidently shot himself while handling a firearm).

Anyway so I'm over at his house and he's in a back room and he calls me back there. I walk in at around 10 years old give or take and he has a 12 guage shotgun pointed directly at my chest and I freeze. I say ""please stop pointing that at me."" He laughed and said it isn't loaded. I ducked back out the doorway and told him to ""rack it."" He racked it. A shell pops out of the chamber and a shell of BUCKSHOT at that and he freaks out and starts apologizing. We were not friends for much longer. I still think about it to this day because he was the kind of kid to pull the trigger to ""prove that it's not loaded."" If he had, I would have a hole were my heart used to be. 2/10 would not recommend."
LifeProTips,fcmcu2a,t1_fcm8plb,1577770776.0,These are the same as Marine Corps safety rules with one excluded: keep your weapon on safe until you intend to fire.
facepalm,fcmceyf,t1_fclym2r,1577770393.0,"I was looking for another service member the Marine Corps was the same way. I wanna say they actually did have dividers in some squad bays however they did not have doors and every toilet had an opposite toilet, and since there were only so many times to take a shit you ended up with a shitting partner sitting across from you every time. That was one of the least nastiest things about boot camp as I'm sure you know lol."
me_irl,fcmbjt6,t1_fclg1l3,1577769635.0,I use bacon reader and though it never automatically refreshes the feed unless you accidently back out or if you accidently hit reload (which is pretty unlikely to not do on purpose as it's a small button near the top). It's a pretty good app in my opinion. The only time I ever accidentally refresh the feed is when I accidentally hit back twice (known as double backing between me and the wife) but other than that it's great!
PublicFreakout,fceq4s9,t1_fcdxram,1577622793.0,"I'm going with downvoted/subsequently up voted guy below and I'm picking a side. And that side is *drum roll* you can't cope with your aggression by doing anything other than either coming to terms with it on your own and fixing it OR seeking the help of a professional to come to terms with it because you couldn't do it on your own. Anything else is just fooling yourself. You can't release aggression by doing aggressive things, you can only become less aggressive through controlling your emotions. Now fight me!"
gratefuldead,fc7lf5e,t1_fc7hwts,1577511241.0,"Lol the first time I took my wife to a show she didn't really know what to expect and doubly so cause we took a little tangle with Lucy. Anyway we are there in the pit (D&Co) and having a great time and they close out set 1 with Bird Song>Loose Lucy>Bird Song and it was magical. I look over at my wife and she looks sooooo sad and says is it over? And I smile and say set 1 is over sure, let's go get some water and get ready for set 2. It was a joy to see her so excited to find out there was a whole set to go plus encore. It was a great moment during a great night and your post compelled me to share it with you!"
Documentaries,fc1h8x7,t1_fc19rrv,1577318713.0,"Look I'm replying to this comment because it's the most recent in the thread. So this goes for you, but everyone else who replied that I didn't engage as well.

You can say that I'm a wack nut job and there's no way I know what happened, and to that last point I'll concede. I don't know what happened for sure, I just know what my opinion about it is. You can all downvote me all you want, and you can also come in the thread to tell me I'm an asshole or an ""armchair psychologist"" or whatever you want to call me it doesn't matter. But just as I don't really know what happened for certain, neither do any of you. It's ridiculous to say that I'm not allowed to have a strong opinion one way, but your strong opinion the other way is the one that's correct, because none of you know either. I can't prove to you that MJ ever concretely fucked a kid. And you can't prove to me that he was just a silly eccentric damaged man that liked to innocently sleep with little boys. Have a merry Christmas."
