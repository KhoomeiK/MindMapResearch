college,ff71k3q,t3_eryxub,1579639290.0,"This might not be the most popular answer, but seek classes that don't require attendance and learn by yourself. It's already a big strength that you like studying, and if you are okay with doing a lot of googling, MOOCS/online classes, youtube videos, and formal online classes (in the same topics) instead of showing up to class, do that -- then just show up and ace the exams. 

Even classes with attendance required usually allow 3-5 unexcused absences, so take them all -- check the attendance policy carefully, and if you only lose a few percentage by missing >5 classes consider just taking that loss and skipping more. 

I deal with similar problems and at the end of the day, the most important thing is that you're (a) learning and (b) getting your degree, and there's no reason you need to attend class everyday to do those things -- especially if being trapped in a classroom is too distracting for you to learn effectively anyway. 

If you can confide in an advisor or disability counselor you might be able to get more institutional support, but sometimes it's better to just go under the radar as much as possible if you're not planning on playing by the rules."

I'm not using my thesis as therapy and even if I was on an epic quest to confess my ""worst actions"", this really wouldn't make the shortlist. As I said, my only motivations would be to strengthen my project and have a conversation that I believe needs to be had."

I think that (a) it makes the topic more real to people to hear a true story, and makes them pay attention, and (b) it is important for people to talk about these problems openly insofar as we actually care about people with opioid problems being able to seek help."
AskAcademia,ff5ev1q,t1_ff5dtlm,1579589862.0,"I've read that, hence my hesitation, but I'm asking about a project not a graduate school application. The paper also notes that one chair said self-disclosure isn't necessarily negative if it is professionally written and appropriate for the context. Is there any version of what I said that could be professionally appropriate?"

college,fevf9ry,t1_feqxytz,1579396722.0,"If OP leaves it anonymously and doesn't leave an identifying note, will it necessarily be clear it's from a student? At my uni's, mailboxes have been open to everyone and mostly receive materials from administrators and other faculties. OP, I would just be careful not to mention you're a student or it's from students."
college,fevewz7,t3_eqm3o6,1579396579.0,"I would go to him about it, but phrase it as ""I am really positive that I answered this, and as you might remember I thought about this question in-depth beforehand and even came to you to discuss it. So I was fully prepared and was sure to answer it. As a result, I am confused that my work is missing for this question. I believe there was a chance that my test was altered after taking it. Is there anything I can do?"" 

As another commenter mentioned, the much more likelier case is that a fellow student got a hold of your test and erased an answer. Even if the class isn't curved, someone could have just been salty about doing poorly in the course, or wanted to look better, or resented that you seemed to be doing well. Maybe they saw you raise your hand in class and got jealous, or maybe they don't know you and just erased some random answers on random people's tests. 

It's a good idea to bring this to your professor's attention, because first off it's possible this was a more widespread problem, and second off he should have some knowledge about who handled the tests, where they were stored, etc. that could help answer if another student accessed them. 

(Not only would suggesting he changed it ruin your chances of him helping you, it's also very implausible. If he had too many A's he could just curve the test or final grades.)"
Professors,fehxrnd,t1_feg25dr,1579125989.0,"The university has the capacity to track the IP address of the submission and either identify it with a user or with a specific location from which they can derive who the user is. This should be even easier if the student used campus wifi which requires an account or logging in.

If the student used something like a VPN or Tor to block their IP address, then technically they couldn't be traced -- but in practice, you can often deduce from the fact they're blocking their IP address who it was (compounded with the fact you can 'rule out' everyone else, given the manpower). This happened once with a kid who sent out a fake bomb threat to try and get finals cancelled; he used Tor and a VPN, but since his was the only computer on campus using Tor, the campus police figured out it was him pretty damn quick.

Outside of the technical issues, there may be some quasi-legal issues about when you are allowed to trace users if they were assured of anonymity, but at least today my guess would be a trace would definitely be permitted in this case.

AskDocs,fdsvevo,t1_fdsth92,1578708446.0,Oh -- definitely follow up with your doctor though (although what I said still applies -- if your IGG is high enough they can assume you had a recent infection)
AskDocs,fdstd86,t1_fdst3a4,1578707686.0,"Actually, I may have misunderstood -- did you have a negative IgM, or just no IgM showing up on your chart? If the former, definitely call your doctor because she may have ran it and not sent the result on accident, or neglected to run it (in which case she probably should)."
AskDocs,fdst3a4,t1_fdsrho3,1578707586.0,"I see. Doctors can be a little trigger-happy to diagnose mono.

NAD but it sounds like your IGG levels were very high (400) which suggests a recent infection rather than a far past one. My guess would be your doctor believes you probably have had a recent active infection in order for your IGG levels to be that high. One way to test that hypothesis would be to check again in another month to see if they are going down (or up, or neither)."

AskDocs,fddy2oj,t1_fddqccj,1578326765.0,"No problem, definitely look into this / ask for it because what you're describing does sound a bit like low sugars. 

Another thing you can try on your own is just taking sugars when you feel like that -- drugstores sell glucose tablets/drinks OTC -- to see if that helps your symptoms. That's not a definitive answer though, since some people don't respond to sugars very well once their sugars get so low that they feel symptoms."
