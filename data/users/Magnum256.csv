I've been poor in my life, and I've been fairly well off. I've noticed that most people could do a lot better financially if they were willing to sacrifice ""comforts"" (not ""needs""), yet most do not want to do so even if means greater long term prosperity.

I'll use myself as an example: I'm fairly introverted, so most of my life I've preferred to either live alone or with a girlfriend, but never roommates. That means that most of my life I've paid 100% or at least a large portion of my rent or mortgage. That's not a ""need"" but a comfort that I've chosen. If I had been willing to roommate with 1 or 2 or 3 people through most of life I could have saved huge amounts of money versus what I actually paid out.

Many people in the same boat, or do similar with restaurant eating, alcohol, leisure activity, unnecessary spending on tech, clothing, vehicles, etc. They do it for comfort or happiness and not out of actual necessity.

Our culture promotes excessive spending, especially among the poor and middle class, but if you can fight the urge and differentiate between comfort and necessity most people will find opportunities to save significant amounts of their money.

Edit: I gave a similar talk to a friend recently and convinced them that spending $400 each month on cigarettes was a poor investment (again, comfort not need), and so they quit. Now they'll be $4800 richer each year. Hopefully they put that money in the Dow :-)"
