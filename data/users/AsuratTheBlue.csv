Psychonaut,ffakqwr,t1_ffaiafs,1579738193.0,"No but I'm aware that what I'm feeling will never be perfectly replicated by anyone, not even myself. There are so many variables even beyond set, setting and dosage that make a trip, you could say that each one is unique"
AskReddit,ff46cd4,t1_ff41suj,1579556510.0,"So I was right, you don't know anything about him, what his role is with Tesla and SpaceX or how he became rich in the first place. I can tell you the guy worked for it and still is, he works like a maniac. One of his biggest flaws is his massive ego, but it's also one of his greatest strengths as far as business goes. He thinks he can leave a massive, lasting influence on mankind and that's what drove him in the early days of SpaceX and the launch of the Model 3.

Say what you will about who did or didn't found Tesla, it doesn't matter. For a variety of reasons, it's tremendously difficult to become a successful car manufacturer. If not for the investors and shareholders who believed in Musk, his vision and his work, Tesla would be long gone. It barely survived the launch of the Model 3, employees were being underpayed and treated like shit but they stayed because they believed in it. The guy's an asshole, he's many things but lazy is not one of them. He claims to have helped design Tesla's batteries, I don't know how true that is, but I know he inspires people and pushes them to their absolute limit"
AskReddit,ff44gtd,t1_ff3pbj4,1579555332.0,"What Galapagos civilization? there were no clues of any pre-columbian settlements, only some evidence of human activity. Sounds like the rest were just peoples who migrated towards more favorable locations but even if your examples of civilizations who ""innovated too little and too late"" weren't all ancient and archaic, my point still stands. There's a big difference between what you're referring to and humans going extinct, or even societal collapse. Today the human species count almost 8 billion people, more than half of which have access to the internet. Entire nations are cooperating towards common goals, be it the attainment of scientific knowledge or technological advancements, the progress of which increases exponentially as time goes on. There's just no comparison."

Psychonaut,fej2gz5,t1_fej1gjz,1579154439.0,"My trips are also more emotional than visual. I also get a lot of synesthesia/blending of the senses and have yet to ""meet entities"". We all react to psychedelics differently. Maybe your tolerance is higher than most though.

You could try tripping in a sensory deprivation tank if you get the chance. I've only used them sober, but that alone can be a great experience, and I've heard that it can make low doses feel like heroic doses"
Psychonaut,fej0cv4,t1_feixswx,1579152426.0,"Every trip I've had, I've cried a least a little bit (happiness). Btw when I say strain I mean a strain of psilocybe cubensis, which is one species of psilocybin mushroom and the most common one by far. Maybe they were referring to a different species but idk.

My previous trips were not really insightful and I don't have a ton of experience, but I think it's all about how you react to the shrooms and how you manage/interpret your reactions. I believe what separates mushroom strains, besides appearance and psilocybin potency, are their alkaloids, which might contribute to the trip (with things like body load and visuals) but probably not to how and what you think."
Psychonaut,feiytis,t1_feirmy9,1579151061.0,"How would you describe your psychedelic experiences? What do you typically do before and during trips?

safe travels"
Psychonaut,feiv65r,t1_feiory8,1579148076.0,"For the first time in weeks I have the motivation to do more than just play video games all day and all night. Right now I just want to focus on holding onto that motivation, and how I can keep it up during my internship (I'm a student). I know that I have to tackle my demons sooner rather than later, and I've started by telling my loved ones about my mental state, but if I try too hard to ""cure myself"" in a short amount of time, I'll probably kill my motivation and be back at square one.

Music is a great way to control the mood of a trip, especially on a high enough dose that telling yourself that you're fine doesn't cut it. But in this case, I did the latter. I got comfortable, closed my eyes and told myself I was fine. At one point during today's trip I remembered a challenging trip where I thought I poisoned myself with the shrooms, and when I felt that same thought creeping in the back of my head (that I might be poisoning myself or that my brain is not reacting how it should), I thought ""no dude, you were wrong then and you'd be wrong now. You're safe""."
Psychonaut,feit8x1,t1_feipz7h,1579146610.0,"Mescaline was the first psychedelic I've tried. I must have done something wrong, because the tea did not work, but given the opportunity I'd try it again."
Psychonaut,feit3kv,t1_feiqg2s,1579146502.0,"I've only tried three different strains but I believe there are real differences, but they are subtle. Some say the perceived difference(s) are due to placebo or psychology (your own perception of the strain), and there definitely seems to be truth to that. In my experience, Golden Teachers give more of a body load and euphoric feeling whereas the Transkei strain gives a more visual experience, I've heard the same thing from other people online. I also found that every time I took Golden Teachers, the most common visual hallucinations I would experience were objects being smaller or larger than they usually are, which was not the case with other strains."
