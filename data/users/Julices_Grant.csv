IndieMusicFeedback,ff41tg5,t1_ff40ixt,1579553696.0,"I've sent to a lot of smaller radios. Usually, some of them responded positively but here I've got nothing ☹️"
IndieMusicFeedback,ff3qhcq,t1_ff3mw4b,1579546657.0,"Radios might be garbage but at least they pay copyrights, which amounts to much more than Spotify, for small artists like myself... :/"
IndieMusicFeedback,ff3kd75,t3_erdj0j,1579542900.0,"I'm not a fan of the synth you used. Sounds very dissonant in this track. Much preferred the intro. 

I checked your other songs. You have a very Elliott Smith-vibe, I like it!

I feel you need to work on your pitch, on the track Empty, I feel you were singing flat many times."
IndieMusicFeedback,ff3k2i4,t3_erfho0,1579542720.0,"I like it man! You should definitely start to add some vocals, maybe play around with samples (RJD2, Gramatik, etc.).

Your song sounds really cool, well done. 

The main synth gets quite repetitive after a while. Maybe try to add some FX (chorus, flanger, saturation, filters, etc.) to spice it up along the way?"
IndieMusicFeedback,ff3junm,t3_ergiif,1579542587.0,"Great video man! I like the song as well. I feel maybe you could try add more contrasts in your singing. You use always the same tone (half singing, half yelling). Maybe soften it up sometimes, to add more nuances."
IndieMusicFeedback,ff3jogr,t3_er9p8g,1579542484.0,"Like someone else posted, your mixing and mastering are way off. The song is saturating very often and that's not pleasing to the ear.

You need to make better use of limiter and mix your gains!"
IndieMusicFeedback,ff3jitl,t3_eqt2pv,1579542387.0,"You need to mix your vocals much better and with much more confidence. I could barely hear a whisper in there.

Also, I like your sounds, but you might need to use drums that have more impact. And maybe white noises to buff it up. Feels very bare.

Just my 2 cents! Keep it up!"
Switzerland,fehwmuy,t3_eowgho,1579125331.0,"Dude, this is absolutely amazing! Well done! 

You have so much talent! I'd love to collaborate with you for a music video, if you're keen that kind of thing!"

IndieMusicFeedback,fehngyz,t3_ep2xmf,1579120108.0,"I'll be honest, this is not my jam.

The guitar gets quite repetitive after a while. I wish there was a release at some point. It's like you're building up tension all the song, and I was just hoping that at some point it would all... release something! But the song ended there.

Sorry!

edit: music video is very cool though!"
IndieMusicFeedback,fehn0k3,t3_ep01ku,1579119845.0,"Sounds very good. I feel like your voice is maybe a tad loud?

Also, I wish there were some ""singing parts"", you know where the vocal is a bit more melodic (like a chorus or a bridge). It's very much ""spoken"" here. 

Good job!"
IndieMusicFeedback,fedahmz,t3_eoh3sz,1579005691.0,"Arrangement sounds top notch, well done man! Great composition as well!

Now the next step is to master this to make it louder without losing all this beautiful mixing!

I'm all against the loudness war but this is the world we live in..."

IndieMusicFeedback,fe2m4xu,t1_fe1o4lx,1578840372.0,"Thanks for your input! 

This track got literally no airplay, whereas I feel this was my most polished production. Perhaps you gave me good things to look into!"
IndieMusicFeedback,fe1j3bf,t3_enm7pa,1578827101.0,"As you may have guessed, this is a song about the Mauritius Island. I tried adding some tropical sonorities, with a xylophone instead of synths, glockenspiels, and on the bridge with the featuring (créole mauricien) some percussions that kinda remind the main mauritian instrument, the ravanne. 


Would love to hear what you think about the song in general, especially the treatment and processing of the vocals, mixing and mastering (all done by myself)."
todayilearned,fe1hsz1,t3_enm67k,1578826702.0,">The Swiss civil code was also considered to be the most modern, the most simply formulated, the most concise and with the greatest popular touch."
IndieMusicFeedback,fe1cjky,t3_enh7dw,1578825050.0,"As another commenter said, I feel you need to treat and process the vocals much more. 

I'm struggling with that so i know it's a pain in the ass.

Also maybe sing with more ""confidence""?"
Logic_Studio,fdvofj1,t1_fds5m8u,1578749663.0,"so nice of you!

I've pmed you!"
todayilearned,fduk9pz,t1_fduda3k,1578734224.0,"You're a rockstar man. I don't even press CD's now, because most people my age don't even have a CD player."
todayilearned,fdu2zzx,t1_fdsqti7,1578726623.0,"OMG, thank you! At least when people were buying CDs, I was making a few bucks, which helped cover big expenses. 

To make the same amount of money, with Spotify, I would have to make like millions and millions of plays, which is not happening obviously.

Streaming is ruining small artists, that's for sure."
finalcutpro,fds01ed,t1_fdrzro8,1578692231.0,"Yep, I've tried both , it doesn't change anything size-speaking."
finalcutpro,fdrzbbk,t1_fdryas8,1578691924.0,"Thanks!

When I do this, I get an mp4 file but it's only 609mb instead of 3 go: https://i.imgur.com/GKwWc9v.png

Am I missing something obvious?"
finalcutpro,fdrxjcc,t1_fdrwd3h,1578691276.0,Thanks for your help! Could you guide me? From what I see I can only export to .mov.
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fdru7wb,t3_em8mlv,1578689773.0,Saving that.
finalcutpro,fdrnirz,t3_emw7eu,1578687008.0,"I need to export an mp4 file with the new audio track without losing quality. I can't seem to realise this with final cut, and quicktime 10 sucks in comparison to the legacy quicktime pro 7"
Logic_Studio,fdqzy7y,t3_emu6g7,1578677661.0,"On the track I'm using:

PitchCor

Envelopper (thanks to /u/Thaffy) to get rid of the small room sound

Channel EQ

1st Compressor

Multipressor

2nd Compressor

Channel EQ

CLA Vocals (to make it pop more)

Exciter

Bus 1: Space Designer - Large spaces - vocal plate
Bus 2: Ensemble and flanger
Bus 3 : Stereo delay"
Logic_Studio,fdqz8ga,t1_fdnh5l9,1578677232.0,"My recording setup sucks (bedroom!) but I had a prof work on my vocals once and they made it sound so much better.

I know I suck at treating vocals, I always have... I've tried a third time with [another youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOGa2-F2vxA) and added the envelopper to give the impression of more reverb :

What do you think?"
todayilearned,fdqz01p,t1_fdqm51m,1578677092.0,Right. What other languages do you speak then?
todayilearned,fdq6t1o,t1_fdpsepe,1578657344.0,"Ah yes, the typical debate where English native speaker (who are usually unilangual) firmly believes English is a very hard language to learn, and then get quickly shut down by many other bilingual people who know English is one of the easiest language existing."
Logic_Studio,fdngdzq,t1_fdnej85,1578585241.0,"Sorry about that!

I will try it as soon as I get home. 

Here are the links fixed:

https://soundcloud.com/julices-grant/test-vocals-with-default-envelopper/s-NGCRK

I've tried looking for tutorials for the envelopper but only found some for drums, which were no use to me. And I couldn't really understand how to fine-tune it. I will try your tips asap."
Logic_Studio,fdmz4mp,t1_fdl7p7w,1578572064.0,"Hey man, thank you for your help!

I remember watching this video. But since it was very basic I got carried away with other videos, trying to add tons of things (desser, multiple EQs, multiple compressors, etc.).

I've tried coming back to the roots, as you advised me, but I'm still unsatisfied with the result...

Here's a second try from scratch following the video you sent: https://soundcloud.com/julices-grant/test-vocals-22/s-icjfF

And then a third try adding an envelopper (default settings).

Do you think it sounds better?"
IndieMusicFeedback,fdjq9dq,t3_elpxvf,1578483258.0,"As another commenter said, you need to work on the vocal chop. They sound way too raw.

Also, your white noises are way too robotic. You need to work on them to make them blend in nicely.

The goal of white noise is too fill in the song without the listener really hearing it."
IndieMusicFeedback,fdjq6en,t3_elnldf,1578483154.0,"It's a nice beat, but it's just that!

It's very hard to determine if a beat is awesome until you have the right vocals. I feel this could work but this sound quite basic."
IndieMusicFeedback,fdjq3zw,t3_elnu2c,1578483066.0,"Good song. Like the lyrics and the melodies.

What is the purpose of this song though? Do you want to add instruments? Make a whole song of it? 

As is, the piano and the vocal sound too generic and the whole song feels repetitive, except maybe the little bridge near the end."
television,fc2deim,t3_efn30w,1577353661.0,"OMG YES. 

It's a small inconvenience but it has ruined many endings for me. 

I can totally understand doing this for tv-shows although it should be possible to deactivate it.

But IT MAKES NO FUCKIN SENSE FOR MOVIES. 

And once the shitty trailer has started, there's no going back to your credits. You have to start the movie and go back to the credits, which is a scrolling pain in the ass if you're on a smart TV.

Please fix this shit Netflix."
