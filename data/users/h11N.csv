mentalhealth,ffsdj1b,t1_ffs9tfh,1580179106.0,"> I think the complicating factor is I feel like therapy sort of...mimicked the external parts of trust and safety while not having the substance? But it mimicked it so well that there's legitimately no visible difference between someone you can trust and someone you can't.

I'm interpreting this is as a relationship that has trust based on external evidence yet there's a lack of trust on an emotional level between the other person and you. Does it sound about right? If you can share more about it so I can understand it better I'd really appreciate it.

And while I believe you that they were acting with good intentions to support you, another part of me would feel frustrated and confused if it was on your place since your concerns about the pattern and situations with homework were not taken and dealt with in a more skillful way by therapists.

At the end of the day you are the one who is the true expert about yourself and a therapist is there to help and guide you with the process of you understanding yourself and what you can do. There are a few questions I'm curious about and I'm not trying to blame your therapists here and my intention is to provide a different perspective. How would you feel if they were to take into account that your concern about the pattern that you've been experiencing in your relationships and how this pattern could develop with a therapist and what you both could do about that? And in another situation regarding homework, how would you feel if they were to understand your struggles for not being able to do the homework and then provide some directions to facilitate a conversation about the issue at hand? What they can suggest for you to change behaviorally to manage homework, explore feelings and thoughts that you have after not being able to do it and how you felt about in the past since you were able to see that it was not going to be done in time or a few other directions."
mentalhealth,ffs7jid,t1_ffrj4b7,1580175072.0,">It's not so much blame on my part, at this point

I'm sorry for misinterpreting. 

And yes trust between you and your therapist is essential and it is not easy to find someone you feel suits you and then you can start building a deeper trusting relationship with them."
mentalhealth,ffpy7yy,t1_ffe1g97,1580110624.0,"> It might be something more like, I'd protest that therapy was pushing me too hard and I couldn't handle the stress it was putting on me. That it was interfering with my life in ways I couldn't handle. And I'd be told in response that therapy could be difficult sometimes and it wouldn't work unless I was willing to handle being uncomfortable sometimes. Or I'd fail to complete something the therapist asked me to do because I was already too overwhelmed and didn't have the skills to do it, and I'd try to express that I couldn't and just get told how therapy wouldn't work if I wasn't willing to put some effort in outside of the sessions.

> Like, legitimately, when I'd try to speak up and change the pattern or go in a different direction I'd be basically told I was being uncooperative or resistant or something.

I'll have to be a little bit judgmental and say that it seems that your therapists have failed you. That's the perspective I'm getting based on your post and comment. I don't want you to blame yourself for the things that they were supposed to be responsible for. I'm not sure how valuable therapy seems to you now after those experiences but if you choose to get back into it, hopefully you would be able find a professional, caring, compassionate, non-judgmental and accepting therapist and sometimes it requires to kinda shop around and to see who you click with. At the same time you can open up slowly so you have enough time gauge their responses in order to avoid being hurt a lot and watch for some red flags such as judgment on their part, not taking you seriously, not being compassionate, not respecting your word, not addressing your concerns and feedback, and anything else that does not feel right to your gut."
Anger,ffpliyz,t3_et20yu,1580098024.0,"Anger might be your defensive mechanism to protect you from feeling pain, hurt, suffering, sadness, grief, shame, disappointment, jealousy and other concrete emotions. It is okay and healthy to feel anger, it is just a matter of practicing the skill of handling it by being able to be present with it yet have control. And since you are working with a therapist hopefully they are going to help you find that deeper root cause and how to be present with anger in a healthy way because suppressing/not experiencing it is not the way."
relationship_advice,ffekwnh,t1_ffeg7ol,1579852357.0,"No worries, I appreciate you being courageous to be vulnerable and open up. 

>  As for seeing a therapist, I dont want to drive him crazy & make him quite his profession just by listening to my bs & trying to help me.

They are paid to do exactly that: to listen to your bs and help you figure it out. Moreover, they are trained to manage their feelings skillfully so there's no driving them crazy. They have heard a lot of things so it is not going to be a crazy experience for them but a legitimate concern which is coming from you and they usually provide a non-judgmental space for you which helps the process. 

Nevertheless, when it comes to your friends I'm going to assume based on your post that you have shared some of the struggles with them. Let me know whether this is true and have you felt like there was a resistance to share your challenges and if so, was there the same level of resistance that you are experiencing right now when it comes to reaching out to a professional? I feel this question and some ideas might help you to view it from a different perspective and maybe it helps.

Also, addressing another point you made in the other comment regarding 

> Seeing a therapist will not fix something that's not fixable

This is exactly what therapy helps with. This statement (probably one of your core beliefs) seems false to me and you are fixable and worthy of love. After reading that last sentence you would most likely feel that either what I am saying is not try, I am trying to cheer you up, I am saying that because I am trying to be nice or many other reasons. That's normal because  that's exactly how you feel and your feelings are valid. For now I'll just say that you CAN change your negative, unproductive and harmful beliefs and therapy supports in that. 

>I'm just hoping to arrange that invite & meeting sooner than expected & just ne gone for good.
> Why waste so much time & money on things that are out of his & my control?

As much as I want to help you I can only do so much because your actions are outside of my control. At the same time how do you feel about an idea of trying new things that haven't worked before and seeing where it goes? 

I've taken a number of guesses which can be unhelpful if I'm mistaken and I'm happy to hear if I am. I can relate to you on a personal level more than you probably think based on my responses. And you can notice that I haven't talked about the issue that you are focused on which is a lack of experience of a romantic relationship. There are probably practical things that you can do that you haven't done yet but I don't think it's going to be too hopeful and helpful too much for you while working on your mental and emotional health by going to therapy as well as developing necessary skills in those areas are going to help you the most. The reasoning for improving mental+emotional health over practical tips for dating is that your thoughts and feelings that arise from seeing others having experiences of relationships make you suffer to an insane degree and I feel compassion for you. All those thoughts about not wanting to keep going arise as a protective mechanism to stop the suffering that you are experiencing and ending it all seems like the only way. It is not. The way of going to therapy and working on yourself is not going to be easy like flipping a switch but it sure as hell is gonna be worth doing it.

You can only do your part and you have no control of the other person and of the outcome. You can do your best and she still might leave you. And it seems so far your behaviors that stem from jealousy are slowly acting like self-fulfilling prophecies so there's enough room for you to work on yourself. I feel you are in a rough spot and you might want to take time for yourself to fully heal from the previous relationship and to feel secure and be okay with yourself.

Advice,ff7nxx3,t3_erq7hi,1579654093.0,"Since noone has responded I'm gonna share a few thoughts. 

First of all, noone knows your financial situation better than you are so it's going to be more on your end to weight pros and cons around that. You can invest some time into it to figure out numbers that you'd like to achieve and the reasons, why's behind the numbers. It gives your more clarity overall. 

And a general idea of your post is that you are torn between pursuing what you enjoy vs pursuing a career for money. Is it going to be taking a riskier route versus a safer one? You can definitely acquire more data. You can talk to more people who major in philosophy, literature, art and ask professors, other knowledgeable people in the filed to get input and all similar things. And when it comes to comp sci and pursuing it because there is money then you dig in yourself, your values and see whether you like to feel stable and secure or you are looking for joy and happiness that you expect to come from money in the future. More information allows you to have more clarity, therefore reducing some uncertainty and it leads to a more calculated decision so this way it's going to be a calculated risk (since your concern is about money when you are pursuing artistic stuff) or an understandable path (since you are not sure whether your underlining goal of whatever that is going to be achieved). An the end of the day it's going to be yours decision to make and neither is going to be right nor wrong since it is your way of living the life.

So based on your hobbies and interests you seem to be in a good spot. Your hobbies are pretty diverse and you're gonna meet a variety of people. Also, if you do any of those with the friends who bring their friends it opens you up to a new and safer circle of people. For example, ask your friends to bring their guys friends for a hike. 

And on top of your interests you are already looking for organizations or maybe clubs to join at your university. It seems to me that you are exposing yourself for interactions with new people while enjoying yourself.

Now it is mostly about finding out which other things work for you when you have no plans with friends on a particular weekend. Experiment and see how things change or not and where they lead you. Maybe it's just a morning part when you wake up and do the same basic routine that you'd do before your work but then you do whatever comes up or maybe it's setting up your intention through a small goal like walk for 20 minutes/read 20 pages/etc while intending to do something marvelous might provoke some anxiety which prevents from achieving whatever you've intended on doing and then leads to feeling ashamed and beating yourself up. 

If I had to describe it in one word then it would be 'momentum'. Sometimes it's doing something automatic when I wake up (e.g. same routine) and sometimes it's being more conscious and using more efforts to carry me to a point that I've set up before the weekend (e.g. taking a walk)."
