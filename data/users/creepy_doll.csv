I still enjoy gaming but between work, eating well, sleeping well, exercise and spending time with people I care for, I'll be lucky to get an hour two most days. I'll sometimes get longer sessions in on the weekends.

When I was in college I could easily get 6+ hours in a day, and since it was coop, it was kind of social, but it did steal from time I should have spent doing other things.

The question really comes down to: are you making time for gaming by reducing time you SHOULD be doing something else? If not, you're fine. If you're sacrificing sleep for more game time though, maybe not such a great idea.

No one needs a pound steak, ever. I think this is more of a cultural issue than a farmers issue though. They produce what the demand is there for. 

Though we certainly should push against lobbying that tries to allow for destructive practices in the name of profit.

I do think we have some issues though in trying to drive for non-gmo organic food, when organic does not mean pesticide free and many gmo foods can have high yield with low impact.

I don’t feel like farmers are the enemy though, I don’t think it’s unreasonable that they overproduce in fertile land when many other places lack such land and need to import. There are without doubts imrpovements to be made in logistics to reduce the amount of damage caused by transport. In a capitalist society the incentives are always towards profits and the only way to change that is either a) change what is profitable(reduce or eliminate demand for high impact products, not only meats but also exotic produce transported from the other side of the globe or inefficiently produced) or regulate it. Both are valid, and I do think farmers deserve a voice lest well intentioned but not fully educated activists actually make the situation worse."

This is a very broad question.

The domestic engineers that entered a company and got trained by the company to become an engineer generally have a limited skillset, though there are occasional exceptions. There are still universities out there that push out capable engineers.

Foreign engineers vary wildly. For the most part the western engineers that get hired have previous experience or at least a relevant degree, so I guess that brings them above the average.

There are also a lot of other non-western engineers and quality there varies wildly. There's some that are super smart, but there are a lot of indian engineers(the ones that aren't working for google, or places like you mentioned) for example that have no interest in the field and are just doing it because it pays well and I would not call them productive.

I would generally guide against trying to determine how useful someone will be by their nationality and just look at what they've done to date, and ask them questions.

I think there is a general shortage of good engineers throughout the world, so for any place hiring, they're generally stuck picking from the left-overs unless they resort to trying to poach gainfully employed individuals from elsewhere."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fej1cqw,t1_feid5hc,1579153367.0,"So I went and checked exactly what warren said about rent control, and she's not even planning it:

https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/protecting-empowering-renters

> My Housing Plan for America invests $500 billion over the next ten years to build, preserve, and rehab more than three million units that will be affordable to lower-income families. My plan will lower rents by 10%, reform land-use rules that restrict affordable housing construction and further racial segregation, and take a critical first step towards closing the racial wealth gap. 
> Or if you want an easy one, rent control.

Since you called it the easy one, I decided to verify this, as I do want to be a ""reasonable person"", and I do not like the trend to selectively pick through arguments.

Where did she say rent control? She's addressing the issue through building more low rent units thus increasing supply and driving down the price.

edit: further in she does mention rent control somewhat. a) she would block states legislators from banning cities from using rent control. b) 

> As President, I’ll create an Innovation Lab in HUD to study strategies that keep rents affordable such as rent control, multi-year leases, zoning reform, and community land trusts, and share data on what works and best practices

So clearly she wants to actually research the issue and find sustainable ways to keep down rents.

I've seen  the arguments against rent control and for the most part it revolves around builders trying to get around the laws to avoid the legislation thus resulting in evictions and lower supply as they increase units that aren't rent controlled. It's clearly a complex matter and rent control on its own is not a fix, so the  fact that she sees it as a subject to be further researched seems like a good approach to me(rather than turning a blind eye to it and pretending nothing is wrong).
end edit

As to the antitrust part, I do somewhat agree with the experts that it weakens companies competitiveness against other nations. It's probably why the EU with its strong antitrust laws has fewer of these behemoths. But I'm entirely ok with that as I do agree with her message that these companies have far too much power. I work in tech, and there is a genuine risk if you want to create a new and innovative product that if you don't allow yourself to be bought up that you just get replaced by a clone created by these behemoths.

I also don't believe that ""the economy"" is solely defined by the gdp or stock market, and I do believe that Warren or Sanders may well cause the GDP to lower. And I'm ok with that, so long as it results in an increase in the living conditions of most people.

Finally I want to highlight that I see her as the more pragmatic version compared to Sanders. There are other candidates you could describe as ""pragmatic""(who are mostly about not rocking the boat), but they for the most part seek to maintain the status quo and their policies fall very short of improving peoples lives. Many of the economic policies of other candidates also make sense *IF* you agree with their worldview of how things should be, *IF* you think that GDP is the only important economic indicator."

So you have these bacteria in your stomach, and if you take broad-spectrum antibiotics(as we far too often do) you can wreak chaos  on that biome.

A lot of places want to cut engineering costs, but seem to have no idea of how the costs of cheaping out are.

Sure initial development is cheaper. You get a hacked together thing delivered reasonably fast. But then problems start coming out. Speed is prioritized over attention to detail so you have weird oddities. They get plastered over. Eventually the engineers who built this clusterfuck are also senior engineers and either too expensive and laid off, or they move to another company for better pay.

My current employer(which I'm mostly happy with) has a freeze on hiring mid-career engineers. They only want to hire fresh college grads. And companies I'm working with(suppliers of middleware) have support folks that don't really understand their own product. I give them a detailed bug report and they'll come back to me with a question that I clearly answered in the report. Or I report a defect and then spend 20 e-mails going back and forth to prove that ""no, it wasn't user error"".

The problem is, there is a lot of demand for engineers out there, and not a lot of them.

Also if you’re tall, expect to have a hard time, you really need to use your core to move out of some of the cramped positions you’ll get stuck in. Flexibility helps too of course.

MadeMeSmile,fdpelws,t1_fdpdvl9,1578626643.0,"> That's the entire point - Americans donate to which organizations they would like instead of having the government tax and allocate those funds to whoever they choose.

That's actually the counterpoint too: people aren't necessarily donating to what will do the most good. You bring up good examples of positive donations. But what about donations to scientology? Or to those megachurches that are basically private businesses to finance the lavish lifestyles of their pastors?

The role of government is to promote general welfare, and to do that they collect taxes and (are supposed to) allocate those with the objective of improving the lives of citizens.

Unfortunately some fail to do this in a way that pleases their constituents and we then get to where we are now. There are a lot of countries out there with high tax rates where citizens(in general, there are always outliers) aren't exactly happy about the  taxes, but are proud to pay them and of the social good they achieve. In the US there is massive distrust though and the government can't effectively perform its role. The problem isn't with the mechanisms of taxation, but with how the government itself is managed. In the case of the US, much of this lies with the way elections are carried out and the lack of proportional representation, which results in lock-in of two parties that can control much of the conversation."

It's a terrible measure since it's pretty easy to force by providing a lot of poor low quality jobs and offering minimal social safety nets so people are  forced into poor jobs by need.

The best measure of economic success are probably things like median household income or mean household income at various borders(bottom 10, each quartile, etc)

We should really collectively get together and find a set of economic indicators that can not be gamed so that officials cannot just make things look good.

A large number of people still believe in trickle down economics: that if the stock market and rich billionaires are doing well that will come to them eventually.

But even if there is a lower gdp, it's possible for average people to have more and enjoy better lives if a huge chunk of it isn't taking by a tiny minority of people. And it's this realization that we need to collectively come to when we examine the economic policy of various candidates."
