AskReddit,felg8ds,t3_epj100,1579221447.0,"“Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus”.
My first (personal) gaming system was a ps2, this game was killer.  I was young so I’d accidentally restart it from time to time and I didn’t even mind because I liked it that much. I haven’t heard/seen anyone talk about that game for at least 9 or 10 years and from what I can remember I’ve never known anyone else (personally) who has owned it. I’d probably play it again if I had the chance, for the nostalgia."

AskTeenGirls,fdrif54,t3_emqa0i,1578684999.0,"Probably David Spade, Drew Lynch and Melissa McCarthy.

Spade is just iconic.  Drew Lynch was the first comedian I got to meet in person and he’s hilarious. Melissa McCarthy is in one of my favorite movies (Tammy) and I die laughing every time."

AskTeenGirls,fcniy4v,t3_ei5ntd,1577812600.0,"I talked to a lot of people when I was in school, I got along with people easily. I still text some, but we’ve never hung out so I guess it’s more of acquaintances. 

I have about 7 (I actually tried counting lmao) I actually hangout with and talk to almost daily.

Quality over quantity."
AskTeenGirls,fcnif61,t3_ehzi7t,1577812336.0,"Shoes. I could buy a brand new pair of shoes and be extremely excited to buy my next pair. So many different brands and color ways. Got my first pair of Jordans this year and I was so happy. 

I like hoodies too. Leggings are sooo comfortable but I don’t have that many."

TrueOffMyChest,fcl07hg,t3_ehnaam,1577736969.0,"I don’t get how people can be so care free about being late. I get anxiety even thinking about being late when someone sets a time, I get myself ready hours before I’m suppose to leave. I also keep an eye on the time, just because it’s respectful. Like I understand being late every now and then, we all have those days. but when it’s constantly, it’s awkward and a problem."
AskTeenGirls,fckzl1x,t3_eh82md,1577736585.0,"Become more fit and eat healthier, eventually make my way into the USAF (or, the Army. Still deciding). If for some reason that thought leaves my mind, then i might just go into community college. I need to start thinking of my future and make goals for myself.

Continue photography, try and get a liking for reading, finally stop procrastinating with other games and just beat Breath Of The Wild already.

Make my boyfriend happy and continue growing our relationship. Little things like trying new foods together, going to new places. Explore nature with him, learn new things together."

AskReddit,fcis20i,t3_eh8gs2,1577668465.0,"Some people get reallyyyyy paranoid (for example, thinking every car is the po-po’s), which tends to ruin the peace and makes everyone else paranoid or uncomfortable in their highness.

You also get the ones who need to smoke before every event. Example: “I gotta smoke before I hangout or do any simple task”. I completely understand wanting to do it before events/occasions every now and then, but I think the whole enjoyment of weed is ruined when you use it every single day. Pretty sure that *can* make you have a higher tolerance, which, I personally, wouldn’t want because I like being able to notice when I’m in the clouds and be able to enjoy the experience (not saying people with a higher tolerance can’t, but I’ve met a few that say it’s not like it use to be). I like to space out my sessions (sometimes). But you do you, this is just a personal preference."

Its a conversation killer when you’re talking to someone then all of a sudden they stop replying mid conversation and end up replying hours later because they forgot."

Growing a garden and having a collection of indoor plants has always been an idea of mine, expecially dealing with herbalism and creating teas. My boyfriend actually knows a bit about plants and does gardening himself, so maybe one day I’ll get the chance to share that hobby with him."
