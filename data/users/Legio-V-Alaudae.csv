Open a gun shop and do SSE transactions. People will pay a 500 to 1,000 dollar premium for every pistol you sell. You would make a million dollar profit your first year, if it's a DOJ smokescreen. I'm certain gun people would also pay for your legal defense too."

bjj,fdazt07,t3_ek7i7v,1578252160.0,"My feedback is specifically on the standing portion. You tried the same foot sweep technique 3 times, it didn't work and other guy just sat down and tossed you. 

Foot sweeps are very challenging to make effective on a resisting opponent that has some training. 

You need a plan B stand up technique if plan A doesn't work. Ideally two techniques that go hand in hand. 

Example: O soto garuma. That is a take down that takes someone backwards flat on their back. If they successfully defend the backwards by pushing their weight forward,  then execute a harai goshi.  Taking them in the direction they are now moving. 

I know it is a lot to think about, but trying the technique over and over again is rarely effective. If they saw it coming once, they're probably ready for it again. 

Or really commit to breaking their balance and keep them moving in that direction. I used to have a very strong hiza garuma entrance.  But if they defended and stayed on their feet, I would immediately follow up with a different forward throw, such as uchi mata. Only if they took a forward step to stop falling on their face. If I didn't get them to move forward, time to switch to plan B.

Once again, I know this seems like a big ask. However, I am really only asking for you to get the hang of two different take downs/throws of your choice in opposite directions. The caveat is: they initial technique must require a big movement for defense. Simply lifting a foot for a fraction of a second doesn't create a big enough opportunity for plan B."
