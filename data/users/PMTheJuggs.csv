On the other hand, I think we underestimate how much money the conglomerates (GM, Ford, VW, etc Universal, Warner etc) and their top ranking execs make. It wouldn't be impossible to develop one ""fun"" car as a Loss Leader. This is how a lot of the fun cars from yesteryear were developed in the first place.

I keep jumping industries but a perfect example is video games. Consoles (their cars) typically sell at a loss but they know they will recoup off the accessories like games, controllers etc. Just like dealerships recoup off maintenance.

The closest we have to this is Tesla IMO, they have the most personality but as a boutique company, they don't have the infrastructure behind them to meet production expectations.

>For example, some of the shots of Wakanda make the city look desolate

Wakanda is a country, not a city. So yes, some parts are desolate.  Most of these shots are simply establishing shots. Wakabi said he found Killmonger at the border (of a hidden country, so boundary would also be an appropriate way to describe it) 

Furthermore, its a fake country of which you have no idea of the demographics. Just suspend disbelief for a couple hours.

> Okoye and Wakabi's marriage was completely irrelevant and could have been left out of the movie

It was meant to add tension to Wakandians picking sides between following T'Challa and Killmonger. They play more into it in the deleted scenes, which were ultimately cut to shave time off a 2 hr movie in which neither of them star in.

>The CG used in the T'Challa v Killmonger fight at the end is unforgivably bad

Fair, but not any worse (subjectively) than the other marvel movies; so with the rest of the points, it seems like you're picking on the movie. Especially here:

>The scenes where Shuri casually insults Ross, who literally took a bullet for Nakia, come off as disrespectful

What part of the movie shows Shuri as respectful? Also they explain that, you know, in saving Ross in like a day from a fatal wound with their tech, it wouldn't have been much work to save Nakia either. Also she's a spy, getting shot at is in her job description.

>And T'Challa is a good role model for kids, but not because of his skin color, but for what he stands for.

This is true. But the reason it's important that he's black is because very, very, very few hollywood movies have black males casted/written as the lead protagonist. When you're part of a marginalized race, it's important to see good people that look like you lead the show. Otherwise these kids start to get the feeling that they're never good enough to be the focus of the story. That's why ""you already had Rhoadey and Sam??"" is such a tonedeaf opinion. It's not like there's some shortage of white heroes.. 


Just let other people enjoy it as much as they do. Not everyone has to be a brooding movie critic."

Because at least to me, to say he won the majority of votes means combining his ""proper"" majority in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where they had say +80% of the vote, with all the other votes in ridings he lost in other provinces with say 20%. In other words, his limited support in most provinces ultimately winning because of his overwhelming support in a couple other provinces. 

Our election process isn't perfect but I feel like it's better to choose parties by community/riding than to tally votes overall. Wouldn't assuming he won by popular vote mean other parties would have to give up seats in ridings they won outright? Who should give up their seats then? Alberta's interests aren't necessarily Ontario's, and imagine one of Quebec's ridings going to conservatives ""just because""."

Also when you're first starting, more weed per joint is easier to roll the paper over. Ideally if its too much to smoke in one session you could just put it out for later.

2 things to keep in mind, basically you're rolling the weed into a ""log"". It'll make more sense if you roll one and unroll it, see how it compressed into one stick. The goal is to keep this log at an even thickness the whole way through. The second thing is you want the paper to get around that log as tightly as possible. I've had friends fold the non-glue half of the paper inwards so it goes around more naturally; I've had other friends use a card to tuck it in.
