politics,ffdw6as,t3_eszko3,1579830431.0,"As a non-American, this is a plea to the two thirds of this demographic who support Trumps removal.  

You are a big enough demographic to significantly influence the next election.  Which means if you all vote, you possibly have the power to remove Trump.  You also have the power to influence the less motivated to also vote. 

Why is this important?  I honestly don't care that your current government is giving effect to policies which reflect the racism  and religious bigotry of Trump supporters.  It's also no business of mine if Americans are happy with a health system that lets people die because they can't afford health care.  And I really don't have any view on the reality that many Americans are disenfranchised by electoral and government systems which mean, generally, that only the wealthy and privileged get to  share the power and riches of the richest and most powerful country to have existed in this world.  I'm also indifferent to the fact that Trump, and by extension Americans, are becoming an international joke.  I honestly believe that most Americans simply don't understand the utter contempt in which Trump is held internationally, and the damage that he is doing to the reputation of America and all Americans.  But all of that is your business, not mine.

But what I do care about is the damage being done to the international economy.  There is an old saying, that when America sneezes, the world catches a cold.  The last global financial crisis was caused by the behaviour of big American Banks.  Not by the economic policies of other governments, not by any natutal crisis, not by the collapse of any markets other than in the USA.  The prevailing economic regulatory environment and the behaviour of a number of America banks ruined the lives of millions of peoiple around the world and impacted, in a veryu substantial and negative way, on  the economies of most other countries.  Every economy in the world suffered to some degree or other.  Some folk here in Australia watched as their retirement savings reduced dramatically in value.  We have 65 year olds here working in grocery stores because they can't afford to retire as a result of the GFC.  

So Trump's ill-conceived policies impact negatively on not just the rest of the world's economies, but on me personally.   Another term of Trump may mean the difference to me and to people like me retiring comfortably and living off my own savings, or working until I am able to access social security.  

Americans who wield a lot of power are fond of chanting ""America first"" in discussion on the proposed actions or policies of your government.  And it is easy to understand such a position.  But for goodness sake try and understand that what happens in America impacts on the rest of the world.  America does not exist in a vacuum.

So vote.  And make sure your friends vote."

There doesn't seem to be much doubt that he sought to extort a political advantage out of the Ukrainian president and there is even less doubt that the Republican Party has acted in the most shameful manner imaginable in approaching this trial.  How McConnell can look at himself in the mirror when he shaves in the morning will forever be a mystery to me.  But what did the framers of the Constitution mean by ""other high crimes and misdemeanors.""   It's one thing to prove that Trump did what is alleged, it's another to determine that those actions represent grounds for removal as they were intended in the Constitution.

Trump is a disgrace to the office he holds and has diminished the United States in the eyes of the world, but one of the inviolable elements of a democracy is respect for the rule of law.  Just because Trump seems to believe the law doesn't apply to him and that he wants to trash the laws relating to executive power and accountability ( or doesn't understand them to begin with) doesn't mean the rest of us should also.

politics,febgprx,t1_fe8ccjr,1578958642.0,"Thanks for understanding that my question was a general one of rights and democracy generally, rather than an attack on gun owners.

As you've suggested, I wouldn't be at all happy with red states legislating in the way you've described.  I would also be unhappy with any state seeking to legislate to make firearm ownership unlawful.  But there are two important issues which add a little complexity to your analogy.  The first is that issues around legislation which addresses matters of morality differ significantly to other legislation - gun control for example.  Legislation outlawing abortion for example will almost certainly be religious based.  This type of legislation is essentially one religious group trying to impose their religious beliefs on the wider community.   While people have a right to religious freedom, does that right mean that the rest of us should be forced to behave in our own lives in the ways dictated by that religion.  If legislation prevents me from marrying my same sex partner, then I am being forced to behave in a way which gives effect to Christian dogma.  Imagine the outcry if some politician sought to introduce legislation which made it illegal to sell non-halal food?  

The second issue surrounds rights.  I understand the second amendment creates a right to bear arms, but it is not an inalienable right.  (Putting aside the difference between inalienable and unalienable for the moment)  Just as the right to drive a motor vehicle, or go fishing, or just about anything else can be removed or modified by legislation, so too can rights around firearm possession.  It's obviously a little more difficult give that this particular right is embedded in the constitution, but the principle is the same.  At least I think so."

But this is for shaping only and hopefully you'll use this sparingly and only when you need to change the shape of a tool.  For honing and polishing I believe the absolute best system is to use a slow-speed wet grinder.  I have a Tormek T8, which here in Australia is the most expensive wet grinder on the market, but there are cheaper products out there these days.  You will need the correct jigs, especially for gouges.  With the jigs you can achieve the same angle every time on any of your turning tools.  These grinders also have leather strops for final polishing.  Once a tool is honed on the wheel and polished on the leather strop, it will have a mirror shine and should be sharp enough to shave hair off your arms.  

The next best option in my view would be waterstones, either ceramic, or the Japanese type, a range of slipstones of various sizes and shapes as well as a lapping plate to ensure flatness.   You will probably need grades of around 400, 600 and 1200 or thereabouts.  

In my workshop I have a high speed grinder, the Tormek with jigs for all the tools I use, including turning tools, bench chisels and plane blades, a Japanese water stone with 400 and 1000 grit (I think...) a small Japanese slip stone which I rarely use anymore, and a good quality diamond lapping plate with 600 and 1000 grade.

If you are using bowl gouges (with a curved end profile)  especially if you have a couple of different grind angles, you should have no trouble getting deeper.  If you are using a roughing gouge though (square end profile), you will be limited in the depths you can achieve.  

Once you've sorted the gouges out, find some way of measuring wall thickness accurately.  Calipers are best.  You will become more confident when you know exactly how much material remain across the whole profile.  

And finally I'd add that if you are wondering whether your tools are sharp enough or not, they probably aren't.  There is absolutely no substitute for sharp tools.  Buying the best sharpening system you can afford should be seen as basic equipment rather than a luxury."

If it had in fact been legal to murder Jews, then some sort of facilitating legislation would have existed at that time.  If what you are saying is true, we should be able to point to some sort of law or decree which allowed the killing of a Jew to fall outside the extant law on murder.    But we can't, because there was no such instrument.  

Here is a list, provided by the British Library, of the anti-Jewish decrees and actions between 1933 ans the end of WWII.  Certainly the police and courts stopped protecting Jews, and Jews were killed during Krystalnacht and beyond, but at no time was there in existence, and law or decree allowing the murder of Jews.

That's 20 million in cold hard cash going directly to relief and support.   They have also set aside from their own budget, $50 million investment to support the development of a long-term blueprint for fire resilience.

Where is the bad in any of that?  What does it matter that the specilaists are volunteers?  Why is Forrest's net worth relevant in any way?  Kylie Jenner donated 200,000 from her net wealth of one billion, or 0.0002 per cent and that was still a valuable and generous donation.

Libertarian,fdmeri3,t1_fdlw31z,1578547504.0,"Not sure how you link abiogenesis and life bringing forth life.  But putting that aside, conception is the start of a process which may ultimately result in the birth of a human being.  And at all points along the process, all the cells which make up the fetus  are human cells of a human being.  That's biology.  But the point at which the collection of fetal cells becomes a human is not."
Libertarian,fdme6o8,t1_fdlyxf3,1578546993.0,A newly conceived fetus consisting only of a handful of cells is no more or less a human than any other part of the mother's body.   Or should we oppose the excision of a ruptured appendix because of its genetic humanity?
AskReddit,fdlw2er,t3_eluch8,1578533885.0,"A couple of years ago I underwent a bone marrow biopsy.  This involves making a small incision in your lower back,  The incision doesn't hurt because a local anesthetic is injected in the site.  But then two needles are inserted through the incision and then into the interior of your hip bone.  As the hip bone can't be anesthetised, you can feel both needles being driven through your bone into the interior bone marrow for a couple of centimetres.   One needle is a small bore, and is used to suck liquid from the interior of the bone.  The other is a larger bore and is used to extract what is essentially a core sample.  

The pain is gone immediately the needle is extracted, but during the insertion it is a very painful experience.  Some places do this procedure under a twighlight sedation.  Always take that option is my advice."
Libertarian,fdltt2m,t1_fdlsajy,1578532328.0,It doesn't suggest that at all.  The argument is simply one about arbitrarily deciding when a  fetus becomes human.  The argument can't be extended to suggest that this is the measure of the worth of a person.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdlbnzm,t3_elt78s,1578520588.0,"This is a serious question from  an Australian.  There have been several posts on Reddit in the recent past which criticise America's health system.  The theme of people dying because they can't afford health care seems to be a recurring one.  My question is whether that is an accurate picture.  I understand that if you don't have health insurance you may not get a premium service, but is it really true to say that people die in America because they can't afford medical care?"

I only added a suggestion that our leaders' decisions should be subject to scrutiny, which doesn't seem to me to be particularly controversial position.   How you can interpret my posts as demonstrating some sinister intent I have not the faintest idea.

 I get it that Trump supporters are super-sensitive about decisions their favourite demagogue makes, but this isn't about him."
AskReddit,fd63g8r,t1_fd3qki6,1578185013.0,"Yes I am constantly disappointed already - but I persevere in hope.  My view is that we are supposed to be the good guys.  It's hard for us to argue that if we choose to ignore international law because it's politically expedient to do so.  Terrorists ignore the conventions which bind the rest of the civilised world - that's what sets us apart from them.  Or at least it should set us apart.  When we commit to military attacks and assassinations outside the bounds of current law, (and this case was NOT and example of that) we lose any legitimate claims we might have to being on the side of ""right""."

AskReddit,fd1jc90,t1_fd14q9g,1578132030.0,"I absolutely agree with most of that - apart from your flawed understanding of the law on armed conflict.  I agree that Soleimani was a legitimate target and I would not suggest otherwise.  But that's just my view and is not necessarily consistent with the law on armed conflict.  

What I do suggest is that the same justification you are using can be applied to Iran and that a US official of equal importance is now a legitimate target for Iran.  If the Secretary of Defence gets tapped while visiting the Middle East, we should regard it as a legitimate military action by Iran rather than an act of terrorism.  

And the law on armed conflict does not, in  any way, validate any action that contributes to the political goals of the war."

I also agree with the rationale to kill this particular individual.  It seems the world is a better place without him and the USA, it's people and its assets are is certainly safer.  

But don't you think we all have an obligation to question the controversial decisions of our leaders?  Particularly a decision to assassinate a high ranking official of another sovereign state.  Isn't thsat the basis of democracy?  Transparency in what government does?"
