Documentaries,ff093nx,t1_feypwgj,1579466522.0,"This is something I've struggled with too.. I mean I know ALL documentaries are biased and manipulated to show and tell what the creator wants to show and tell. I'd always loved Louis for how good he was at getting into people's lives but I think to do so it obviously takes being quite cleverly manipulative. Watching his docos for me is always 50% the weird shit being documented and 50% watching how Louis 'manipulates' his subjects. I found this [article](https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-11-18/how-to-communicate-like-louis-theroux/?fbclid=IwAR2qaITKlVp8991rS5DE6z45ZwGABeobOwWTPf2nv6__wovti5TvYLpb3Lw) to provide a good rundown of his techniques.

I actually went to see him live in person the other week and he somewhat addressed the issue saying something along the lines of being afraid of making situations worse for people. Even so, though I love him and I think he's a great storyteller and facilitator of stories and I appreciate that but the way he didn't go too into it and especially after the comments from sex workers from this most recent doco I'm feeling a little bit off and I think he does too."

The first guy was especially bad - after seeing how close he parked to my car and noticing that I was sat in my car he climbed out the fucking passenger side instead of fixing his parking. Had me fuming.

EDIT: Make that THREE times now"
