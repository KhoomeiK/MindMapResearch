fatlogic,ffh28sa,t1_ffbnmxs,1579921151.0,I fucking love brownies. I have to budget so hard to fit them in.
fatlogic,ffgdcxx,t1_ffawinf,1579903728.0,"Yeah I flew several times while obese (BMI 30 or 31 I think) and I was nowhere close to ""spilling over."" Planes are not comfortable for anyone, but you have to be pretty darn big to actually not fit in the seats."
fatlogic,ffgc3iu,t1_ffaqnzo,1579902949.0,There was literally a post on here about that haha
fatlogic,ffa087q,t1_ff7bqim,1579725249.0,"I've seen that too and it's so nonsensical because ""flattering"" doesn't always mean you're trying to look thinner.

Dresses and ankle boots are unflattering on me because I have skinny calves and wider hips, so my legs end up looking like chicken legs. I wear taller boots to make my calves look *bigger.* because it's more flattering. 

High waisted pants are unflattering on me because I'm already short waisted, so they make my torso look nonexistent. This has nothing to do with weight."
fatlogic,feune9h,t1_feumynv,1579388217.0,"The lowest I went in the depths of my eating disorder was 300-600. But this was short lived and it was only because I was irrationally terrified that if I ate more I would gain weight, which was obviously false. People forget that you don't *actually* need to eat so little to lose weight, even to be underweight. And all anorexic minds are different."
fatlogic,fet03be,t3_eqhfl0,1579370568.0,"I'm a healthy weight but I've always been pretty lazy about exercise. Six months ago I was diagnosed with inappropriate sinus tachycardia (just means your heart is beating too fast but there's nothing else wrong with it). However my doctor warned me that my chronic tachycardia could cause left ventricular hypertrophy; in fact, my EKGs were starting to show signs of it. That really scared me because I'm only 25! So I took his advice and started on beta blockers and also got a gym membership. I've been doing low intensity cardio and weights almost every day, and my resting heart rate has gone down a lot. It's in the low 70s, which is a HUGE difference. I'm hoping if I keep up the exercise I might even be able to decrease my dose of beta blockers, because I don't like their side effects. Looking forward to seeing the doctor later this month so he can see my progress.

Edit: I don't mean to imply that inappropriate sinus tachycardia is caused by laziness. It's not, it appears to be most common in young, slender women. But low intensity exercise is an important part of treatment, so I'm glad this was the kick in the pants I needed to get off my butt!"
fatlogic,fesxv49,t3_eqgo9g,1579370044.0,"""the fact that I'm an average size and obese is bizarre"" -- obesity does not mean ""fatter than average."" It means you're in a weight category that significantly increases risk of multiple health problems. If everyone suddenly started doing heroin, you wouldn't say ""the fact that I do an average amount of heroin and am still classed as having opioid use disorder is bizarre! I'm just like everyone else!"""
fatlogic,feswv0k,t3_eqc3bh,1579369764.0,"I just don't understand why they go to the doctor at all. If you don't trust doctors because sometimes they're wrong, fine. But why go?"
fatlogic,fesvxxw,t3_eqa0id,1579369577.0,"""as long as you're not actively dying, you're fine"" is quite a take"
