I was raised Christian but when I moved out on my own I learned a lot about witchcraft and shamans. I liked the idea of making my own future, not just being part of ""god's plan"" I haven't had a psychotic episode in ten years cause I stopped doing hallucinogens.

I use grounding techniques until i fall asleep. I've been level for a while on latuda. No racing thoughts as of late.  Unfortunately my insurance isn't going to cover it any more and i started lamictal this week. Sleeping has been hard.

OGPBackroom,feid1zv,t1_fei8iz4,1579135666.0,"So after scanning the item instead of telling you what osn, it tells you 1-8. One will always be top left tote on your cart. Two will be top right and so on. It's more efficient. The labels look basically the same just have 1-8 added to them. It also helps with fitting things in the totes. Although the ability to make a new tote label has gone away unless you are in oversized or exceptions. If an item really doesn't fit in the tote you'll need to nil pick it and let your manager make a ticket."
