An alliance with an even closer neighbour would be the best move but that is not on the cards. But in the long term, Korea and Japan working together would be formidable in the region. It is entirely understandable that Koreans are not keen on it, and Japan is not really interested either, but in terms of the long game, Japan and Korea really do need each other. Culturally, historically, economically and geopolitically they have so much to gain if relations could one day be smoothed over. It's unrealistic in the short term but I hope it eventually happens."

I was not espousing the delights of Communism; I was merely drawing attention to the historical fact that the international human rights system as we know it is largely thanks to pressure from the capitalist bloc on political rights and the communist bloc on social and economic rights. The US (and others) were forced to grant their own citizens improved socio-economic rights because they feared that socialist movements would become more attractive if they didn't. It is the same dynamic at play in this story about the village in West Virginia. It is an uncomfortable fact for many people, as evidenced in your defensive reply. In fact, if the US were forced into granting more socio-economic rights because of pressure by the Nazis (as your comment parodies) then that would also be slightly uncomfortable for the west as it challenges the narrative that we have always been beacons of freedom. The reality is that workers' movements have always had to fight hard for the freedoms we have. They were never given freely by the state and the owner class."

todayilearned,ff1nvi9,t1_ff1l9ln,1579482300.0,"> All through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, UN committees negotiated the language of the two covenants that, in 1966, finally brought into international law the principles laid out in the UDHR. The drafters had imagined that the covenants and an international court would follow quickly on the heels of the UDHR. Instead, the Cold War assured that they would have to wait twenty years for the covenants and half a century until the International Criminal Court came to life. In these long, wearying negotiations, the US and many of its allies proved not to be great advocates of human rights. Instead, they fought resolutely against two provisions that would become bedrocks of the international human rights system: self-determination and social and economic rights. In the still-colonial world of the 1950s, Britain, France, Portugal, Belgium, and many others feared that the concept of self-determination would undermine their empires. Rightfully so. For the US especially, any mention of social and economic rights smacked of socialism and communism. The US would only countenance political rights as articulated in the French, American, and Latin American revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and agreed to the social rights provisions of the UDHR only with great reluctance.

They were also despised as lazy and undisciplined and of 'bad capitalist stock', basically exactly the same tropes later used against Asians by Europeans. The Japanese were also described in the same way by 19th-century capitalists. So it's interesting that two of the most capitalist nations on the planet, Japan and Germany, were not too long ago being described as unfit for a creative capitalist system. Jang Ha Joon writes a lot about this in his work on capitalism. Of course we need no reminding that Korea was described in exactly these terms too until the 'Miracle on the Han' and are now regarded as model capitalists by almost everyone. China are just following the tried and tested model of capitalist development followed by almost every single nation. You are right that it won't do so forever, and that is because there is more money to be made in innovation and development itself. That is where China is moving now too. In a decade or two we will see a lot more innovation in China and its trajectory is moving in a very similar direction to Germany, Japan, and Korea, so I would not be so complacent as to think Korea has nothing to worry about in the Asian innovation stakes."
