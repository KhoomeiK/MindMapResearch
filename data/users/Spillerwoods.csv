Bellingham,ff7nvkm,t1_ff79nnu,1579654047.0,"These aren't fruit or drain flies. They aren't anywhere near the drains. They aren't anywhere near our trash or kitchen compost. I've worked in produce, I'm very familiar with those types of pests (apple cider vinegar traps knock them out in a day or two). We don't have mold or mildew in our windows, I'm on top of that. We do, however, have shitty 1974 metal frame windows with extra ""storm window"" added on the upstairs windows. We've taken all of the screen off because they would be trapped between the screen and the outer slider. From there, they make their way through the little crevices and come into the house, only to stay buzzing around the window like they want to go back out. Basicly, they are tiny flying cats."

The holidays are over and it's the slowest time of year for donations. Sadly, kitties who need help never slow down. These are 3 recent local cats WFA took in. The vet bill is stacking up and foster homes need cat food (Costco bags of Kirkland cat food are great but so is that half used bag of kibble or canned food that your cat won't eat anymore!).

I'm hoping to reach a broader audience via reddit. Maybe you know someone who would be a perfect fit for Mama. She is a beautiful longhaired dilute tortie looking for a quiet, indoor only home with no small children, dogs or other cats. She is a fairly independent Kitty but does enjoy getting head scritches and the occasional lap cuddle. I believe she could bond with someone once given the chance. She is a strong willed Queen kitty who is quick to let you know if you are overstepping your bounds with her. I feel she is under constant stress in the adoption center and really just needs someone to give her a chance. She is about 3 years old and is absolutely gorgeous. Here is a link to her petfinder but if you are interested, please come down to the Bellingham Petsmart (next to Michael's) to fill out an application. Help us find Mama the home she deserves!

So like, those ""ring bell for service"" bells scare the shit out of her and make her shake and hide. There's also a local bird with a loud chirp that does it. But what forced us to try prozac was last spring we had wasps living in the attic. It caused so much constant stress that she stopped coming upstairs altogether. She spent most of her day under our bed and we had to feed her downstairs. She is so much better now, both with meeting other dogs and being around children too.
