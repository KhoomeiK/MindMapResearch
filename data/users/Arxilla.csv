When i was a bit younger i found that a mouse got stuck on one of the traps, since i kept hearing squeaking noises. I felt bad for it, so i went to get my dads work gloves, and even though he kept trying to bite me, tried my best to pry him off the trap...it took a while, and i was being as carful i could, but apparently either i was not carful enough, or he was just too weak, he could barely move after i got him off. I figured it was likely due to glue still restricting some of his movements....he was even sticking to the gloves. I did end up putting him outside in the backyard, even though I hoped that he would be ok....i guess deep down i knew he wouldn’t live long."
