2. Similarities don't end there, I am working on a men's fashion brand too. Lol! That's my e-commerce/ manufacturing business. I started making oils and soaps for my skin issues like five years ago - pretty good at RnD and mad scientists stuff. Now I sell a collection of organic body care products, leather goods and accessories for men.   
But I see what you mean, I feel like that no one family or friends speaks the same language as me. I am trying to be the rock for them. I honestly did try reaching out to people early this year, I was at a really low point in my life. But, most of them just took advantage of my weakness. Looking back I wish, if I didn't say jack to anyone and moved on with my life. Fucking Quora advises doesn't always work lol!. It's lonely asf sometimes, but I am learning to embrace the solitude and work with things on my own. 
3. Most definitely we should connect, cheers! will drop you a line. Thank you for asking all these questions btw, I really enjoyed sharing my thoughts :') - I really hope I helped in anyway."

I think someone mentioned somewhere in this thread about 0% interest credit card plans. Just plan it out, play it safe - I wouldn't borrow money from friends or family. 
2. Cheers!

I am getting an office because I want to hire some people, and get that experience/responsibility/seriousness owning a business. I've been operating from my room/office/bedroom floor for over 4 years - I wake up in front of the computer it's just a tiny space with loads of boxes and shelves. Did this while I was working full time, so didn't really need an office space. But, I fell in to really bad habits and depression due to some tragic events in my family. Recently my sister suggested that it would good if I plan to get an office space so I can get out of the house. She's right, if I can get in to a routine of ""going to work"" it'll help I think. 

This is what brought me to think about getting an office space. I think if I can get someone to handle part of my work, I can spend my time on other things. I also wanted to hire someone so I am not locked down to one place, take care of things when I am not around.

If you don't need to have a office space, and if you can still work from your basement/garage. Just stick to it till you ""must"" have a office business place. This is my personal opinion."

Entrepreneur,fc2f82u,t1_fc0zppu,1577356774.0,"1. Well I was too naive and too young to know anything better. People I reached out to, thought who could mentor me were interested in my business in the early stages. But I never got a single penny from them nor any help. All they did was to show me how difficult to get a task done (in paper), but all it took me was to make few phone calls and figure shit on my own. Stop believing what people say, that's what I learnt from the so called startup-experts/ or angel investors. I probably got served a bad card, but I am not willing to risk it again with these silly things.
2. Friends - early stages of startup, you would want to hire your friends or partner up with them. This is what most of the articles/guides would say. Me being a nice guy - I expected good from my friends. I thought I'd get my closest friends involved and help them out,.   
\- I had one guy who just stole my idea. Started his own business and ditched me. He's doing pretty well, but he still lies to my face saying it's a client project that he got. I let it slide, I just pretend I don't know.  
\- Had another friend in the business as a partner, was with me for 2 years. He just got too distracted with his own problems and money became the priority. He'd do a half-ass job and ask me to do the rest when I point things out. Got to a point I just couldn't deal with it, and it was easier for me to do things on my own then getting him to do it. So yeah, he'll be out of the picture in few months.
3. People who think life is about partying and drugs. No seriously, I had a startup that I closed down in 3 months. I loved the fact that I can talk about business problems and close deals. This is the last set of skills I taught myself working at an ad agency. I quit my job to join with few talented people in my network. I closed 4 clients without even an office space or the business name. Funded all what we need using the first month's pay. Unfortunately 2 out of 4 partners were too busy, smoking too much shit or popping pills - didn't see this coming till it was too late. They spent all the money for weed, pills or partying. I had to call it quits when we lost few clients and had no money to pay the people whom they had hired. The team was too busy fucking things up and planning orgies. All they wanted was me to make money so they can party.

I am pretty good at recovering from worse case scenarios and planning out the future. This year (2019) was by far the worse, too many lessons in a short period of time.  I kinda foresaw all these things, and had contingency plans as a backup. I most definitely lost few people on this journey. You live and you learn."

Hugging my sister at my brothers funarel. 

My sister telling me that her and my brother both got molested when they were kids, and he would do things to her because he didn't know any better. 

My sister breaking down at a friend's place, saying that she wishes she had a normal family. 

She telling me that she just puts on a happy face everyday, but our parents talk shit all the time. 

These some things I deal with on a daily basis since I lost him.

Edit: thanks everyone"

tip 1: Reading, writing, audiobooks - all of these have helped me throughout. I started with listening to audio books. 

tip 2: I used to have a punching bag in my room, it helped me with dealing with pain and negative thoughts. I just work the bag till I can't anymore. Then just crash... For the past  few months I had no access to it, thanks to some construction work at my place. The other day I was at a really bad place, so I just punched myself in the head so I can shake off the thoughts and fall asleep. I eventually did, dunno if its because of the hits or just I was tired.

bonus tip: Sleeping helps, you just have to do something till you feel tired and fall asleep. I read somewhere there are two ways you can shut your thoughts, one is by death the other is by getting some damn sleep. Have a good one!"

2. Yup. I am actually in the process of getting a small office space in the near future so I can hire an assistant. For the money I will pitch in from both of my businesses. For the past ten years all I did was train people to do my work. So I am pretty confident when it comes to doing that part. 

Hiring someone is really important. But plan how you will do it. Like training, introduction to the business, paper work, HR etc... I think it would work out because by doing so you can spend your time in more important areas of the business. This will help you get some load off from your side as well. Plus the responsibility of having someone will help you be more serious about your venture. Find someone with the passion to learn not for what they are on paper. I am planning on getting paid interns who interested in marketing as a career or just some kid with a clean slate."
