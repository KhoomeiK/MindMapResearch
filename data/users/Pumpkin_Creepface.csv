Last week we had a new hire, 20ish, social media savvy and fast paced. 

I was provisioning their workstation and setting them up when they told me ""I don't need a PC, I'm just going to work from my phone"". 

Their jobs entailed database and spreadsheet work, and an email workload. ""I can do all of that from my iPhone"" they stated. 

I looped in their manager, a Boomer hardcore manager Karen, who sat him down and explained in no uncertain terms that he was to work from his desktop. 

So every fuckdamn day since then they have made excuses as to why they can't use their desktop. 

""I need an ergonomic keyboard"", ""It takes too long to load"", ""I need a stand-up desk"", ""I can't get on the internet"", ""It's not working"". 

We got him a special keyboard, ordered him a stand-up desk, and I confirmed there was zero internet outages or system crashes in his entire period of employment, from the diagnostic agent that constantly runs on their own PC. 

He calls me 'out of touch', and 'obsolete'. 

So as an experiment we let him work from his phone Thursday and Friday. 

He got less than 1/8th of his expected workload done, and that's using the high water mark of his own performance when he was using the PC but constantly complaining.

Every culture is really just an extension of biological evolution that happens faster, and is subject to similar pressures. 

Individual humans are kind of like cells in a body that is the culture. 

All cultures are either in symbiosis or competition, but there is absolutely an ecosystem of cultures. 

The thing is, just like we can't declare carnivore animals 'objectively evil' for killing to survive, as it is the mechanism they have evolved to support and reproduce themselves, we really can't call cultures 'objectively evil' for what they do to support and reproduce themselves. 

I mean, we can point at individual 'cells' within the culture and say 'yes those people are objectively evil for ordering and committing horrific acts', there is absolutely no culture on the planet of more than a million people who haven't engaged in such acts. 

China is an ancient culture with remarkable contiguity, it is also a pragmatic and sometimes ruthless culture. 

People have said 'China is evil for creating the circumstances that fostered this disease' but they aren't exactly correct, just like you can't say 'that wolf is evil for killing that deer'. 

It is the unfolding of the core cultural features of China, which are again survival mechanisms to sustain and propagate itself. 

What we _can_ say, is 'China's cultural processes are antagonistic to other cultures', but then again every culture has these features.

Because of competition. 

As it stands now, China is poised to become the new capstone of power on this planet, and a large part of it **is absolutely due to their pragmatism and ruthlessness**. 

Some of the most prestigious American private schools are now pushing Mandarin on students that have business aptitude because they know that it may very well soon become the defacto international trade language, replacing English as America is eclipsed (which is happening quicker than I'd like I admit). 

Please never hate the fact that your half Chinese. This is none of your doing. Culturally you sound American, and that's what I am going to think of you as. 

That said, I honestly believe that as terrible as the things that have happened with the HK riots, this disease outbreak, and countless other pragmatic and ruthless decisions, that China's cultural framework may be the most successful on the planet. 

At least as far as competition for land, resources, and power are concerned. 

And in a very real way that's all that matters. 

Personally, I'd hate to live within the Chinese culture. I don't think I have the mental toolkit to thrive in that kind of environment. 

But I can't deny their effectiveness. 

That said, as every organism has its weaknesses, and that a lot of those weaknesses are actually consequences of their survival strategies (carnivores are more prone to disease because of their food source, as well as their food source allow them greater survivability and energy density). 

Unfortunately for all of those suffering illness in China, their population density and social structure make these kinds of outbreaks more common, they are also survival features for the culture at large. 

Only time will tell if those survival features can overcome this plague. 

That's basically natural selection for cultures, live and for all to see."

No, that's not true actually. Yes the house can impeach for any reason, as it is an investigation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_crimes_and_misdemeanors

>he charge of high crimes and misdemeanors covers allegations of misconduct by officials. Offenses by officials also include ordinary crimes, but perhaps with different standards of proof and punishment than for non-officials, on the grounds that more is expected of officials by their oaths of office. Indeed the offense may not even be a breach of criminal statute. See Harvard Law Review ""The majority view is that a president can legally be impeached for 'intentional, evil deeds' that 'drastically subvert the Constitution and involve an unforgivable abuse of the presidency' — even if those deeds didn’t violate any criminal laws.""
