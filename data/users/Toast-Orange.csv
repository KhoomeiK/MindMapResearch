No country is clean, just because the US is the most recent doesn't mean the British and the EU didn't rape the fuck out of places like Central America and Africa. 

Well I mean no where was really safe from the British during their world spanning empire."

Public school in central IL."
Showerthoughts,fepu38g,t1_feprjxm,1579331325.0,"I mean, the US didn't invade another country (or..6) to round up their natives and gas them in chambers. 

While what the US did the natives was bad, don't even pretend it's on the same level as the nazi's."
iamatotalpieceofshit,feptrv3,t1_fepswsa,1579331005.0,"I mean you're literally wrong. Their website says ""The average monthly cost of living at Willow creek comes out to about 1500 a month in taxes and fees"" but sure, keep pushing your dumb ass narrative because you people seem to think 'OLD WHITE PEOPLE? RICH AF THEY FUCKED US'


The average home is 300k which if you already owned a home and had a career (gasp like all 55+ people probably would) you could afford it. These people aren't living in fucking mansions. these are 1500 square foot homes. 

But i'm sure you'll react like an adult to being told you're just flat out wrong. You sure wont have a meltdown and spam report and send threats. I'm sure."

Uh, you know not everyone 50+ is some billionaire right? Going off the community they live in they would be like middle class. But sure, keep being delusional :)"
iamatotalpieceofshit,fepsu6p,t3_eq9jjm,1579330090.0,"I wonder if this these comments would be as supportive if the roles were swapped. 

IE: Grand parent who needs help lives with her grandson in a 'young only' area of town but the owner is trying to kick her out.

Lol na, because ""old white people are evil! boomers bad!"""
iamatotalpieceofshit,fepsq0z,t1_fepriny,1579329978.0,"They have fixed budgets, mostly so increasing taxes for education (which is a fucking yearly thing in IL) would actually fuck these people pretty hard."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fepslfz,t1_fepotq1,1579329856.0,"You're just guessing these people are rich and dodging taxes..because? ""Boomer bad!""?

edit: Lol ya'll are actually so mad that old people are retired and your slaving away and crying on reddit? Jesus this sub is shit. Sorry dudes, old people are old, they generally have more spending money and are done with their lives. Not their problem you got worthless degrees and refuse to better yourself but then blame them for your life problems. Grow up kiddies.

Ya'll are getting baited by an obvious anti-white poster who's history is full of 'kill all boomers' and 'death to whites' comments. Stop being retarded, jesus fuckin christ"
smashbros,feo5173,t1_fenc8hg,1579295208.0,"Really now? So you're telling me Jokers meter is complex? Because it's just a meter you fill. 7 year olds understand filling meters in games like Pokemon.

Good nice at defending your boyfriend OP, but you look kinda silly dude."
NoStupidQuestions,feo4wnn,t1_fenyymj,1579295134.0,That's a tricky answer and I really don't have the answer haha. I would guess IL could do whatever we want the others could just follow us or not?

He was the VA for Byleth from launch (July 26th) to to 1.0.2 patch was was on September 10th. So about 2 months or so"
