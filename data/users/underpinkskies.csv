bulletjournal,fec5lel,t3_eobeej,1578966995.0,i honestly love including mini calendars in my weeklys! they help me visualize how far i am into a month. and i'm usually left with extra space so it's always a fun little thing to add. most people hate adding the tiny numbers but i honestly find it kind of relaxing.
AgeGap,fdz0w3i,t3_en7y9j,1578785542.0,"girl i FEEL you -- i'm 19 and my partner is 48, and though i go to college far from home i technically still live at home. i came back for break and to spend time with my partner and was pretty much met with hostility, my parents basically forbidding me to see him again, my dad even threatening violence toward my partner. we're not religious but i grew up in a really rough household, so i feel you on that front -- my partner has been such a source of mental health and comfort for me. hang in there!! we got this."
