You are valuable. Here, you are loved. And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster. He is the original. The first lost, and the first found. The creator of Sakaar and the father of the Contest of Champions. Where once you were nothing, now you are something. You are the property of the Grandmaster. Congratulations!

DnD,fcwoxfj,t3_ejb7n8,1578032074.0,"Here is the full backstory for the character. 

Erabor was a drow who lived in the Fey Wild. Life was simple & he lived without care. Till one day, a band of Raiders from the Material Plain set an assault on his village, slaughtering everyone. Erabor’s face was mauled by one of the Raider’s beasts. Assuming all were dead, the Raiders moved on. 
(A little bit of fun trivia, the Raiders were a group that my party was hunting in another campaign we did, but they got away. I’m creating an expanded campaign universe, lol)
When he awoke, he saw the horrors of his home. Friends, family, all gone. A Traveling merchant came across Erabor & nursed him back to health. When he was strong enough, he set out in search of the Raiders. He would travel around asking for any information, but because of his face, none would help. So Erabor dawned the grinning mask. He has vowed never take it off until his village has been avenged. Erabor then sought out a guild of rogues to be taught in their ways. This is where his story in the campaign begins."
