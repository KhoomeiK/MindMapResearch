changemyview,ff982sa,t1_ff95ekk,1579707015.0,"I think we might be using discrimination differently or have very different views because jobs requiring driving often discriminate based on vision. NBA players are male and WNBA are female. Pilots need to be below the age of 65. You don't think that discrimination is wrong, right? Is it just a matter of non-binary restrictions? If a company didn't hold being a smoker against someone in a nebulous way but rather said if you smoke you can't have the job, or if you smoke your salary will be deducted by the added insurance premium would that be better? But even for nebulous discrimination, what about bank loans? Banks give loans based on the perceived ability to repay the loan and to my knowledge there isn't a a strict rule set. Instead it's based on a variety of factors including current asset values, salary, employment type, credit score, etc. I even got a job once that included housing and the employer told me there were two main applicants they were looking at and one had a whole family and lived in a different state and thus they'd need more money for housing and for relocation costs than for me who was single and didn't require relocation. Do you think that's wrong?
Most fundamentally, for jobs where there are more qualified applicants than there are positions available, how does the employer choose which applicant?"
changemyview,ff94s2a,t1_ff9461q,1579704829.0,"Sure, and I don't disagree with that, but that's more of an argument against the interviewing process. Unless there's a concrete test/metric that an applicant fails, some applicants will be chosen for a job and some won't. Oftentimes the employer will hire someone based on personal biases which is not an ideal system, but the system that's in place for a lot of jobs."
changemyview,ff92q4k,t1_ff8zb9v,1579703395.0,"I'm assuming you mean it's either ok to discriminate on a particular basis or it's not and not a blanket statement that all discrimination is ok or none is. So my claim hasn't change, it's ok to discriminate based on smoking. There are just people in the comments who seem to think if employers are discriminating based on smoking it's because they have a grudge against smokers, and I'm saying I don't condone that behavior. I also condone discriminating based on BMI but don't condone discriminating against BMI because the employer thinks fat people are lazy. But if you look at my CMV it's not CMV: any form of discrimination against smokers is ok. So I think discriminating against smokers is ok because there are specific reasons/conditions (I've listed some) that are acceptable."
changemyview,ff6r1cy,t1_ff6obyl,1579633082.0,"That's an interesting point. There seems to be a lot of studies that aren't all in agreement. I do agree tobacco smoking is inversely correlated with SES, but it seems other things are to. BMI seems to be inversely correlated https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3719170/. While drinking rates are bimodal with higher SES having an equal if not greater rate of alcohol consumption than lower SES. However it seems that the negative consequences of alcohol (binge drinking, dependency, etc.) are higher with lower SES https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4872618/. So I'm not disagreeing that it's a classist dog whistle but I think I'd need a more detailed argument before I agree. I'm also not convinced it means that discriminating based on smoking is wrong for the same reasons it's not always wrong to discriminate based on BMI. I agree people probably wrongfully discriminate based on smoking because they assume attributes to a smoker that aren't necessarily true (like they do with high BMI people), but that doesn't mean discriminating against a smoker because of things like insurance costs or performance abilities is wrong."
changemyview,ff60sbk,t1_ff3svay,1579616190.0,This is a great response and deserves more attention
changemyview,ff45g3d,t1_ff44353,1579555950.0,"I couldn't find any hard statistics on the issue, but anecdotally I know I had a job where there were ebbs and flow in the amount of work and when there was less work people would go out and smoke and not get in trouble but you couldn't just go outside and hang out. Here's some more anecdotal evidence:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/423wb5/why\_do\_employers\_allow\_smoke\_breaks\_for\_smokers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/423wb5/why_do_employers_allow_smoke_breaks_for_smokers/) 

Also here's an article that includes the average wasted time from smoke breaks:  [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/work-relationships/2018/02/28/should-nonsmokers-get-extra-vacation-days-smoke-breaks/381878002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/work-relationships/2018/02/28/should-nonsmokers-get-extra-vacation-days-smoke-breaks/381878002/) 

So I can't tell you how many companies allow extra breaks for nonsmokers, but it doesn't seem to be negligible."
changemyview,ff418ta,t1_ff3zq7k,1579553341.0,And I agree with that. From the taking breaks perspective if the employer doesn't have to give breaks specifically for smokers there's no problem. The problem is when employers give smokers extra breaks.

changemyview,ff3zlh4,t1_ff3xojh,1579552314.0,"Well it would definitely depend on the job but I'll try to answer this succinctly. 

What constitutes smoking would be up the employer and how much detail they ask. So some jobs just ask if you smoke cigarettes, thus if you smoke cigars it wouldn't count as smoking. If the employer goes into detail and asks questions about frequency then that would be the criteria. 

If you start smoking, again, it would depend on the employer. If part of your employment is you need to disclose once you start smoking then I assume it'd be the same as employment where you need to disclose relationships with a coworker. If not, it might depend on whether they ask you again every X years once you're employed. I know for some security clearances they revisit security questions periodically, so you'd have to disclose then. If you don't have to as part of your contract and they only ask when you get the job, not after, I'd say you can start smoking and not disclose. 

Now in the case where it's a unclear, maybe you smoke cigarillos, or socially smoke and you aren't sure if that counts. I personally would just ask HR if that counts and let them handle it, but let's say you don't. I think if a reasonable person would consider you to be lying (like you smoke 2 packs a day and say you don't), your employer would presumably have grounds to fire you if they wanted and grounds to not support health issues related to the smoking. If it's something more ambiguous, like your boss sees you smoking with a friend but that's the 2nd cigarette you've had in a year, then it would probably come down to whatever your employer wanted to do. Maybe they ignore it or maybe they say that counts and update your HR file without and sort of reprimand. It'd really be up to the employer"
changemyview,ff3ydga,t1_ff3wf0x,1579551546.0,"I support employers making the decision that will maximize their profits (or whatever is they're doing if they're not a for-profit corporation). So if you're trying to get a job at a place that has flexible hours and isn't on the hook for any insurance premiums and you can do the job better than any other applicant, then the employer should higher you. If there's another applicant who can do the job just as well and takes less breaks and doesn't require extra money towards health insurance because they don't smoke, I think the employer should higher the other person. Again, all things being equal. If the interviewer things you'll be a better fit or whatever, that's fine, they should higher you. I also don't think any employer should be not hiring a smoker because of some moral bullshit like the smoker is weak willed because they smoke or something. I think an employer can not hire a smoker because it effects them financially not because an interviewer doesn't like smokers for some reason"

changemyview,ff3vio8,t1_ff3tna7,1579549764.0,"1. I'm a little confused what you mean here, but yes, I am all for fixing the US health care system.
2. ""I’d argue weight, age, injury and illness effect those far more than smoking."" I agree those are important and should also be considered. I think things like weight are a little harder to consider because it's not a binary like smoking but I definitely support weight being a relevant factor in the hiring process for military jobs."
changemyview,ff3usvw,t1_ff3sz4s,1579549317.0,"For break times if all you need is the normal break times that's fine and I see nothing wrong. The issue that I have is when there are extra breaks for smokers. I had a job a while back that allowed for smokers to take extra (paid) breaks when the workflow was light. So my point is employers shouldn't allow extra smoke breaks, or should allow everyone to take breaks. I know some non-smokers want extra vacation days to compensate and I read somewhere on reddit about a nonsmoker taking an extra break to just sit and eat crackers, but I've definitely worked jobs where sitting and eating crackers would not be allowed but smoking was. 

As for the military-type jobs: if you can't physically do the job, as in you fail the fitness test, you won't be hired for the job period. I'm arguing that smoking limits the effectiveness of your ability to do the job. In a situation where there's a greater demand for employees than there are applicants, take anyone who passes the tests. However, in areas where there's more applicants who can pass all the tests than there are open positions, I think smoking should be a factor. To make things simpler and just look at the fitness example,  if there are two applicants and 1 barely passes and the other passes with flying colors but smokes, I'd say take the smoker. If they equal in all other ways, take the nonsmoker. Here's a link of how smoking can limit your abilities to perform in the military:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215338/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215338/)"
changemyview,ff3sngz,t1_ff3r2p2,1579547987.0,"It would be somewhat job dependent, but two instances I can think of where it would matter to the employer:

1. Medical insurance. If your employer is responsible for your insurance and they have to pay a premium because you smoke then it's important to the employer.

unpopularopinion,femvg03,t1_femi784,1579270662.0,"""It is preferable to not bring animals into existence that just exist to be used and killed for food"" If you truly mean ""just"" here and you're ignoring the secondary joy brought to people by having a pseudo-pet (for lack of better word) then I agree. If you mean you mean ""primarily"" than I disagree and think things like personal farms and the way Peruvians keep guinea pigs in their house then eat them is fine. But I assume you mean primarily? Because I don't even know how you could have an animal ""just"" for food and treat it humanely.

""If you don't exist, you cant want to exist. If you exist you can suffer."" I'm not disputing this but are you implying existence is a moral wrong because of suffering or some other point? Or are you just stating a premise with no conclusion?

""To say that it is prefarable to exist for a short time then not exist does not hold water: following that logic we would have to bring as many humans and animals into existence as possible to be ethical."" Come on, you surely understand that governing rules apply to a given state and if the state changes the rules may need to change as well. This is like when children first realize that it's possible to drink too much water then say: if water's so healthy why can't I just keep drinking it? Over- and under-population play a huge role in the ethics of procreation so in situations where there's overpopulation, say with dogs in the US, then it's ethically irresponsible to produce more dogs. In several acre properties with no other animal life than humans it's ethical to get some chickens and raise them.

""Also to let chicken life 5 years is not sustainable, because he/she would eat a lot of graisn/take a lot of land and we could not feed a lot of people with that. Just eat the grain directly. Makes way more sense."" It's also more sustainable for you to not use your computer or phone to argue with strangers on reddit and yet here we are. People don't live their lives to optimize sustainability, otherwise the vast majority would start killing themselves until CO2 emissions dropped. Eating nothing but grain is a less enjoyable and less healthy life than incorporating other nutrition sources."

I just think there's too many people saying things they don't personally believe. I also think some of the opinions that people think are generally unpopular aren't. If 81% of people agree with the opinion then it's not unpopular, it's just not being said out loud.
