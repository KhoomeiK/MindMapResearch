We don’t really talk and a lot of us suffer from anxiety, depression and sometimes we get bullied. Now to get stuff out of the way, we didn’t get it from vaccines. We just behave different and we see the world differently. Sometimes we can say and think stuff we don’t mean, we can act out of order and we overall have bad coping mechanisms. That doesn’t mean we are dumb. I’m very intelligent and have a 3.4 gpa. I am also taking some advanced classes and stuff. Sure we can struggle with socializing and often get in trouble for speaking out of order but we aren’t dumb. Idk I don’t know how it doesn’t feel to have autism or forms of it but I am still a normal person

No One would join him, Luke would win faster and he would’ve gone to shit. But I guess he’s so brilliant."
PrequelMemes,fg480y7,t3_ewnqja,1580498102.0,He was always kinda ridiculous though. His plan in episode I was to blockade a planet to protest tax law. He then takes over his own planet only to have it taken back when a fucking 9 year old shit head blew up a droid ship. also his apprentice who’s been training for years is defeated by a Palawan. Don’t get me started on episode 2.
