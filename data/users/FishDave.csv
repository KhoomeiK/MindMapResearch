Anxiety,fekrygs,t3_epndwe,1579206366.0,"Failing the driving test on first time is pretty common, there should be no worries about your mental abilities. When it comes to that, i can truly say that everyone is nervous and anxious in this situation. My driving teacher told me the most curious stories about the chillest people being so nervous that they couldn't even start. Take your tries and you ll make it on your own way, comparing yourself to other makes unhappy. (what i did : don't tell anyone when your test is so you don't have the social stress) You got this!"
