I have reached an age where bearing one of my own would be reckless if not suicidal, so if some kid calls me mummy, it will be an adoption or a foster. It can take a few parentals to bring up a child (making one into an adult alone was not what I would choose as my hobby), and I didn't make the effort to find a breeding partner at the right time.

The Newcastle group are called Mordenvale.

The SCA are reenacting all the *good* bits of the Middle Ages, previously generally restricted to Europe between 600-1600, but these days anything or any place from around the Eurasian continent before 1600 is reenactable if it is fun, safe, and legal. 

Martial arts are a major part of the Society, and is taught (for free other than membership price, and, eventually, the armour and weapons cost) at least once a week at ""fighter practice"", which in the Newcastle region tends to be on Sunday afternoons (but seems to be on hiatus during the worst of the heat currently) near Charlestown. You need nothing to turn up and try it out, other than enthusiasm. The University has its own group and its own practices, at the Uni. They would also be a great place to turn up and say hi and see if you like the game. They're called the College of St Crispin.

The game doesn't only revolve around using a sword and a shield though (although I'd point out here that martial arts in the SCA are nongenderspecific, and plenty of nonmales swing a sword with success) and plenty of people play medieval music, make medieval tools, equipment, food and drinks, draw and write using medieval methods, dance medieval dances and sing medieval songs (including writing their own medieval songs and poetry, etc. You're not just required to use what is remembered or written from that time period). 

You name it, if it was in the Middle Ages, and is fun, safe and legal to reenact now, we probably have done it, and would like to try it again. It isn't fantasy gaming, more a historical game, but people often do describe it as similar to the game Game of Thrones books.... and yes, the writer of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is in fact a member."
