insanepeoplefacebook,fck3oxa,t1_fcjzvby,1577715655.0,Part of the birther movement also claims that when he moved to Indonesia as a child he had to give up U.S. citizenship to become a citizen there. When coming back to America he supposedly never reapplied to become a citizen. Or something like that
insanepeoplefacebook,fcjzvby,t1_fcjjzaz,1577712078.0,He used that name as a child in Indonesia and was called Barry in high school.

insanepeoplefacebook,fcgr889,t1_fcgnapa,1577643213.0,The folks over at r/the_donald refer to him as GEOTUS (God Emperor of the United States). I know it's done to own the libs but I think there are those out there that believe it. He fills stadiums for rallies where he rambles for an hour or more about nothing. And they just clap and cheer
insanepeoplefacebook,fcghgbt,t3_eh6luq,1577640068.0,Well hes still got another term to build up his resume for historians to analyze. I say he will get another term because there are countless people like this poster that will vote for him no matter what

YouShouldKnow,fcac2vo,t1_fcababe,1577566509.0,"I dont know code but what you stated is not a goal. You said you want to get serious about learning to code. A goal would be more like this:

Specific - I want to learn Java, html, c++,  etc. Before 2021

Measurable - by 2021 you have learned enough of whatever code you choose to create a webpage, game, app, etc.

Achievable(or action as another user stated and I like) - read a book on chosen code, practice online, download games, complete a course

Realistic - yes it is because children learn code

Time oriented - when do you want to be proficient enough that you feel you have learned to code"
YouShouldKnow,fca7pg3,t1_fca7mjc,1577564309.0,Great idea. It does seem a little redundant
YouShouldKnow,fca73os,t1_fca6n28,1577564035.0,Very true. If you can stick it out through the first weeks or months it becomes part of your routine

YouShouldKnow,fca0efw,t1_fc9z7js,1577560930.0,I usually see progress within the first 2 to 3 weeks and then I will plateau and it's difficult for me to continue. I think I will try to set short term goals related to task completion rather than physical appearance which can take much longer
YouShouldKnow,fc9viwe,t1_fc9v5w2,1577558826.0,I believe this is the method used to achieve the moon landing goal u/elad34 commented about
YouShouldKnow,fc9tzc2,t1_fc9rprp,1577558190.0,"I gave the example of weight loss because that's a pretty common one around this time of year. I learned in this in boot camp when I was 20 and began using it then. I also began to carry a small notepad that I would write in. Sometimes it was tasks, other times just ideas that popped up in my head. I used this method to stop smoking by progressively hitting milestones, such as only 1 a day or only when I drank. I also used it to set up an emergency fund for my family. 

I usually do what u/flotus_brews commented, which is cut your goal in half. I know if I put too much pressure on myself I will usually quit on the goal. So I like to set smaller goals that lead me to my ultimate goal."
YouShouldKnow,fc9qvi3,t1_fc9qkx9,1577556835.0,Any example?
