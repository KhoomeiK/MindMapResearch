newbrain,feizke2,t1_fed6xkn,1579151716.0,It's better than a phone I guess... but Kindle is still a screen? I think the whole point is to avoid the screen :)

getdisciplined,fe6qd8b,t1_fdlyjs0,1578900482.0,Thanks for a candid feedback. We did water a lot of things down so majority of our users could understand it. We'll soon create a \[science\] section on the website or the app to elaborate on this. We'll come back and make another post for that subject. Thanks again. We love questions like this.
getdisciplined,fe6q4fp,t1_fdnxpmg,1578900177.0,No you didn't! You can always opt out. We'll send you an email soon!
getdisciplined,fdluxbb,t1_fdlnhui,1578533080.0,"Yes. We believe MOST people would keep their word, because this is about ""breaking bad habits"" and not ""creating new ones"" to just show off. Please keep in touch with us. We'll send free brain hacks that can help break bad habits and keep you in the development loop."
getdisciplined,fdlurp1,t1_fdldj8e,1578532975.0,"Great point. We'll have some ads in the beginning, but if you support us there would be an ad free version"
getdisciplined,fdlupxf,t1_fdl911d,1578532941.0,I will seriously consider adding this to one of the selective problems...
getdisciplined,fdluoin,t1_fdktz0n,1578532915.0,"Yes, you're right. This app is not a healthy habit building app. Rather, it's a ""break bad habit"" app (well, it will be). Your comment about giving reward for NOT doing something is key!"
getdisciplined,fdluiku,t1_fdknho8,1578532805.0,"Thanks for your story. Great to hear that you've progressed so much. In terms of donations, we plan to add various methods in the future!"
getdisciplined,fdlufzc,t1_fdkvzan,1578532755.0,"Sorry, we'll attach a link as fast as possible!"
getdisciplined,fdludzt,t1_fdk88o3,1578532717.0,Fixed. Thanks alot!
getdisciplined,fdlud5o,t1_fdkrk3d,1578532701.0,Yeeessss. This is an underrated post. Thank you for investing your valuable time into helping our future(kids). We send useful brain hacks that can break bad habits along with the app development over email. So feel free to subscribe for free.
getdisciplined,fdlu6lf,t1_fdkknuk,1578532579.0,Great book. Very well written and effective in real life
getdisciplined,fdlu5o5,t1_fdleqwa,1578532562.0,"Thanks for a candid feedback. We're not a huge group so there will be mistakes. And this is not a ""take over the world!"" type of a project. We really want to help you guys break bad habits, which start with ""triggers"" and ""solutions"". We'll fix it as fast as possible."
getdisciplined,fdltwf0,t1_fdkccad,1578532389.0,"Nope, no $ needed. Most of the features will be free forever. Few features would require small payment, but they are NOT necessary for you to succeed. Paid features would mostly exist for cost of operation."
getdisciplined,fdlto6d,t1_fdkf8p5,1578532237.0,"Yes! But meanwhile, you can get free brain hacks that could inspire you to break bad habits through email. Check the site out :)"
getdisciplined,fdltk3l,t1_fdkupuv,1578532161.0,"Basically, neuroscience theories on breaking bad habits, turned into protocols (rules). Based on our and other research, we implemented the best ones into the app. It's getting better everyday :)"
getdisciplined,fdltfs9,t1_fdlcasn,1578532079.0,Thanks for the idea. Transferred to the team
getdisciplined,fdltbdz,t1_fdkjn3g,1578531997.0,"That's a very interesting concept. Except, you'd still have to schedule the threat right? It might be a high roadblock compared to ""triggers"" and ""solutions"" that are recommended for a specific bad habit. But will transfer this idea to the devs."
getdisciplined,fdlt1ln,t1_fdkc8yl,1578531811.0,"Great point. Our approach is not about ""using the app"". We don't really want you to keep using it. The whole point would be to ""break bad habits"" and use it when you ""need"" it, which does not require constant use of the app.

Allow me to extrapolate. Our hypothesis is that most people don't ""really want"" to create a new habit. Healthy habits sound good on paper, but do people ""really really"" want them?  And if so, is the habit right for them? We don't think so. So we focused on two things.

1. Help people quickly define ""Bad habits"" / ""Triggers"" / ""Solutions"". We'd help you understand *what and why* of your bad habit, and provide potential solutions to try out. Also, we'd recommend other successful users who had the same ""bad habit"" and similar ""triggers"" and ""solutions"" as you.
2. Make the process social and fun(rewarding). Instead of a loner type apps, we want this to become a social platform where you can come to solve your problem for a month, get reward, and come back later again when you need it.

Let's keep in touch so we can show you our hypothesis and its' development."
