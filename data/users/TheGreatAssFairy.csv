I could never get myself to sell my own models. Did you make a good profit? The ""real"" models - that are plastic, you have to paint, string up, etc. are the next level of patience for me. I think my love for ships came from when I was 5 and saw a pirate ship at my grandparents house you could look into, to see a picture of pirates and that was just the coolest thing ever to me.
