By that logic we could all just reduce our carbon footprint by buying stock in companies like GP. At least where I live, those  developed areas are concentrated. 

>At one point, where you live and where I live looked very similar. Then development started, cities began expanding. Suburbs appear, they get turned into city, and the farmlands around the city get turned into suburbs. Cities continue to expand, and more and more green space will be taken away.

Want to get into impermeable services? 
I'd argue there's less of them in cities per person. How many live under your roof and how big is it? My record is 300 people under a roof of about 5000 square feet. This was in a building with no parking lot. Currently it's eight people under a roof of less than 1000 sqft - again, no parking lot. That would be cramped in a single family home. How many people work in your place of business? My office building is on smaller side, only 40 stories, but almost 5000 people work there. And not for nothing, of the 100+ people on my floor, I can think of exactly one who drives to work. Again, there is no parking lot. As for run off, most cities treat stormwater before it's reintroduced into the environment. Does where you live even have a water treatment plant?

Rural areas are better than the burbs on a per person basis, but they're not scalable. The reason you can get by with gravel roads is that hardly anyone uses them. If 10,000 city dwellers moved to where you live, you wouldn't be able to make any arguments a out how green it is any longer.

By that logic we could all just reduce our carbon footprint by buying stock in companies like GP. At least where I live, those  developed areas are concentrated. 

>At one point, where you live and where I live looked very similar. Then development started, cities began expanding. Suburbs appear, they get turned into city, and the farmlands around the city get turned into suburbs. Cities continue to expand, and more and more green space will be taken away. Iâ€™ve personally noticed the incredible amount of development along the 81 corridor in Harrisburg. 

You'll no argument from me there. Suburbs are evil and people who live in them are selfish.

>Just think about the sheer amount of impermeable surfaces in a large city, where does all that water go after it picks up contaminates on the streets? What about streams and rivers that are rerouted entirely underground? What animal habitat was destroyed when an apartment complex was built?

Want to get into impermeable services? 
I'd argue there's less of them in cities per person. How many live under your roof and how big is it? My record is 300 people under a roof of about 5000 square feet. This was in a building with no parking lot. Currently it's eight people under a roof of less than 1000 sqft - again, no parking lot. That would be cramped in a single family home. How many people work in your place of business? My office building is on smaller side, only 40 stories, but almost 5000 people work there. And not for nothing, of the 100+ people on my floor, I can think of exactly one who drives to work. Again, there is no parking lot. As for run off, most cities treat stormwater before it's reintroduced into the environment. Does where you live even have a water treatment plant?

Rural areas are better than the burbs on a per person basis, but they're not scalable. The reason you can get by with gravel roads is that hardly anyone uses them. If 10,000 city dwellers moved to where you live, you wouldn't be able to make any arguments a out how green it is any longer. On the other hand, 10,000 people could move to philly and we  wouldn't need to encroach on any green space at all. Cites thrive because of scale."
