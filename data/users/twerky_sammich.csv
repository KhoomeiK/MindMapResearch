BabyBumps,ffefgew,t1_ffeattn,1579845982.0,They also wrote another book called “China Wakes” about China’s development from the times of Mao to modern days that is equally incredible.
BabyBumps,ffefd75,t1_ffeattn,1579845889.0,"Yes! It’s an AMAZING book. At the risk of sounding dramatic, it changed my life when I read it in high school. It is a little outdated by now (I think it was published in 2007 or 2008), but it’s SO informative and compassionate in covering a plethora of women’s and children’s issues around the world. From sex trafficking to period stigma to childbirth and mothering, it’s got a little bit of everything. It’s tough to read at times, but also so inspiring and a real motivator to get out and help the world. Definitely one of my all-time favorite reads. I really don’t think you’ll ever regret reading it!!"
BabyBumps,ffea82e,t1_ffe0amb,1579841033.0,"If you read “Half the Sky” by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl Wudunn, there are a few chapters in there about obstetric fistulas that are absolutely brutal to read. Women get stuck in labor for weeks, the baby dies in the canal, and by the time they get the poor thing out, the mother is left with holes that make her completely incontinent, and she’s then banished to an isolated hut with no help because she stinks so badly and can’t take care of herself without horrific pain. It’s heartbreaking and eye-opening."
BabyBumps,ffda82u,t1_ffczya1,1579816487.0,I’m kind-of blown away by this obsession with natural birth lately. Was there some evidence that medicated births are highly dangerous that I completely missed? Where did this pushback come from?
mildlyinteresting,ffd9yl0,t1_ffd84ln,1579816334.0,So true. I see at least two Lunas every week on this site.
BabyBumps,ffa39ki,t3_esbb96,1579727014.0,"I think it’s nice that you like your pregnant body. :) Unfortunately, it’s almost expected for women to hate their bodies at almost any stage. Part of that comes from society’s overbearing expectations, and it probably also comes from the rapid changes that take place during pregnancy. I wish more women could love and accept their incredible bodies and focus on what they’re achieving instead of what they feel inadequate about, but I COMPLETELY get why that is so hard sometimes. I hope you feel like Superwoman. :)"
TikTokCringe,ff8i79y,t3_es4bzv,1579679630.0,The lipstick on her teeth fills me with anxiety.
BabyBumps,ff8bf01,t1_ff79o9a,1579671802.0,"Also, if there is a problem with the baby, I would want to be able to prepare as much as possible beforehand so that I’m not a deer in headlights after they’re born. I realize you can’t prepare completely for any part of parenthood, and to each their own, but it’s insane to me that someone would look down their nose at parents who just want to be informed."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,ff5hhzk,t3_erkvlz,1579593105.0,Poor pup. So glad he’s in a safe and loving place now. ❤️
starterpacks,ff4o911,t1_ff3yh7k,1579568437.0,"I love Roseanne with all my heart, and Dan’s character, as you said, was not idiotic at all. He was funny and occasionally forgetful, but he was a great husband and father and acted brilliantly in addition to Roseanne’s character. I love Dan Conner and the way John Goodman portrayed him."
happy,feu5g5z,t3_eqlzk0,1579383320.0,Congrats to you both! I hope your wife is doing great and that your baby is healthy as can be. :)
thebachelor,fekpb7f,t1_feistff,1579204800.0,"I completely agree. He’s a SNOOZE FEST with few substantive things to say, and this is entirely personal, but I don’t find him physically attractive. He has a baby face."
aww,fe0b0ws,t3_end0tw,1578808269.0,Look at those eyes!!! What an angelic floof!
aww,fe03wka,t3_enhxmb,1578802443.0,"What a gorgeous kitty! I have 3 of my own, and they’re the cutest, sweetest, funniest little fluffs. You won’t regret getting her. ❤️"
happy,fdsof34,t3_emzz3x,1578705874.0,Congrats! I hope you feel right at home. :)
BabyBumps,fdkucrg,t3_eluzo4,1578511332.0,"My initials are T.E.A.M., and I always thought that was pretty cool growing up. Plus, Melody is very pretty! I think it works just fine as a name."
AMA,fdjacxf,t1_fdj9502,1578463146.0,That’s wonderful! I hope she’s healthy and has all the love in the world when she arrives. :)
AMA,fdj91gj,t3_elj7ig,1578461958.0,"I got married quite young, as well (21). It’s not true that it’s always a bad idea. I’m on year 5 and I love being married. :) What part of parenthood are you looking forward to most?"
progresspics,fdifd6o,t3_eljfcj,1578441643.0,101 lbs is mind-boggling. You are BADASS! Way to take charge of your life!!!
justneckbeardthings,fd33cn5,t1_fd2ds4a,1578154374.0,"I'm extremely confused, as well. I think I'm missing something here."
starterpacks,fd0j89s,t3_ejm0aq,1578119604.0,And that hotel smell. You KNOW what I'm referring to.
happy,fczj6rk,t3_ejob0y,1578102411.0,"It's sweet that you appreciate her as a wife and mother. It ain't always easy work, so the appreciation goes a long way! :)"
youseeingthisshit,fcyv4ns,t1_fcy4ang,1578087747.0,I'm 25 and don't remember 9/11 at ALL except for maybe one moment where I was sitting in front of the TV at home. I actually feel self-conscious about saying I don't remember it because people act incredulous.
aww,fcp41ng,t1_fcoqcql,1577849807.0,Assholes.
aww,fcp3vs3,t1_fcozgvc,1577849665.0,"I'm jealous! One of my kitties is a rescue and must have been indoor-outdoor with her previous family because she is DYING to go outside most of the time. I try to take her for walks occasionally, but there are TONS of dogs in our complex and people leave the building doors wide open a lot of the time. I wish there was a good solution."
BabyBumps,fcmmtpe,t3_ehzr9w,1577782041.0,"This was terrifying to read. I'm SO HAPPY to hear that both you and your baby are okay and that this terrible potential choice didn't become a reality. You are so freakin brave, I'm blown away!!!"
BabyBumps,fclh6rf,t1_fck6zy8,1577747703.0,"Damn, is this the Dark Ages? Do people really still blame the woman for not carrying the gender of child that they want? What the hell do they expect us to do about it?"
SkincareAddiction,fcimhwz,t1_fci3w4e,1577665042.0,"I find this to be a pattern in this sub. Someone posts something saying ""Don't be obsessive about sunscreen application"" or ""Don't be afraid of going outside"" and people in the comments take it to mean that OP has insinuated that sunscreen is completely unnecessary. It's irritating to see people react without reading the entire post carefully."
ZeroWaste,fcbdg0x,t3_egv05j,1577585512.0,"I just ordered some too and am actually excited to use them (which sounds ridiculous, I know). I love putting my sustainable products to good use, though!"
CozyPlaces,fbwrfya,t3_eercsb,1577157470.0,I just barely watched an episode of Shark Tank that featured the Getaway guys trying to get a loan to expand their cabins to the West Coast! Nice to see that their company is still doing well. :)
