You should be looking for the statistical significance of the results (""what was the p-value?""), not just the sample size."

You took a valid argument (men and women compete separately, for obvious reasons, and their skill levels can't be compared because of men's _very significant_ physical advantage), and took it to a ridiculous level to try and prove your point. You might certainly be the GOAT on mental gymnastics."

IsItBullshit,ff1xmdh,t1_ff05eiz,1579488504.0,"It is, of course, a more relevant argument for history museums, but that doesn't stop it from applying to art galleries as well. I'm sure most people would rather see an object painted by a famous artist a couple centuries ago than the perfect replica of it that was made last year, especially now that art has become something of a commodity."
IsItBullshit,ff16wdt,t1_fezxb7q,1579475837.0,"Do you really think people would be as excited to go see a replica? Most people who visit art museums aren't connoisseurs, they just want to see a famous painting.

When I first saw a Rafael painting my first thought wasn't ""wow the brushwork is exquisite and the colors are beautiful"", I thought ""fuck, this is an actual Rafael, it's so close I could touch it!""."
IsItBullshit,fezx1h4,t1_fezvdvf,1579462782.0,"Good for you, but it's a pretty disingenuous argument to say there's no difference. Many people find enjoyment in seeing objects of historical significance personally, and I'm sure you know that. It's probably the main reason museums exist in the first place."
IsItBullshit,feztlf7,t1_fezsguh,1579461492.0,"I mean, wouldn't you find it interesting to see the gun that killed Abraham Lincoln, or a sword that was used in an important battle? 
Of course with paintings there's the aesthetic aspect as well, but seeing an object of actual historical significance definitely adds to the experience. Just because you're more interested in the art doesn't mean the historical significance of the display isn't just as important."
IsItBullshit,fezsb47,t1_feykhnt,1579461011.0,"> If you cannot tell the difference, why is it important that it is ""the original""?

Museums are not just art galleries, they hold historical artifacts. If museums were full of replicas most people would have no interest in visiting.

The enjoyment comes not just from the painting itself, but also from seeing an object that is centuries old and has an entire story behind it."

There is a scene where Harry et al. are arguing about some fish, but why did they even need to catch the fish? An earlier scene shows them eating regular canned food, they could have just multiplied that instead. Why would they have gone on a journey like that without packing food? Honestly pretty inconsequential, but still kind of stupid.

And it sounds like poverty is a pretty obsolete concept in a world where you can just make shit appear out of nowhere, or multiply stuff that already exists."
AskReddit,fen8lli,t1_fen1aol,1579279345.0,"You can't make food appear, but you CAN multiply it if you already have some. Also, just go to a stream and do ""Accio fish"" or something. There's no reason for anyone to starve in that universe."
