Piracy,fd9zndz,t1_fd9ehay,1578239983.0,"I guess no,not the remuxes.
 I've seen their releases after SPARKS or similar 2pass BRRips are released. So i think thats their source."
Piracy,fd9zc2p,t1_fd9gaxp,1578239835.0,Yeah absolutely fine if you're ok with it. It's personal preference c:
Piracy,fd9wto0,t1_fd9ov94,1578238981.0,Did I say about that? Don't be a tryhard. It's a rabbit hole.
Piracy,fd97typ,t1_fd94n67,1578229657.0,"You can search this sub about this. Lots of discussions are there.
Long story short - Its bad quality. You shouldn't go for it unless absolutely necessary."
Piracy,fd97evs,t1_fd975mp,1578229525.0,Nah this isn't the fastest source. If you want fastest then use Rarbg and get the x264 source.
Piracy,fd91kp4,t1_fd8nuv1,1578226879.0,"Yify is THE last place to go afa I'm concerned.
Rarbg 2500kbps 2pass encodes are way superior if seeds are there. I like to grab those if possible.
If not, i search opendirectories and stuff but never yify.

But I think everyone who uses fancy private trackers and shit now, has used yify at some point in their lives, probably at start of their piracy adventure.

I used praise yify lol in 2010-11 when I got my 1st pc and got introduced to piracy by my friend."
Piracy,fd8h6tg,t1_fd88qy2,1578218354.0,Oh really? Enlighten me please!
Piracy,fd8h0t3,t3_ek9r2s,1578218287.0,"Who is this site for?

-those with data caps and who dont care about quality much but do about size due to storage restrictions.
Also people who want decent resolution in smallest possible size.

The encoder does CRF 24+ mostly to yeild super less size release compared to source.

Others stay away from this thread. This isn't place to brag about how you watch Remux release that you got from X private tracker on yout 4k HDR tv with 7.1 system. No one cares in this thread."
