Since Jesus came in human form, I am assuming he had some level of ego, but it was all through the view of God. Ego is defined as ""a person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance."" So, Jesus understood his importance as God.

1) Scientific studies are not perfect, and generally speaking, it is easy to find flaws in most. This study is likely no exception.

2) Even if it is 1% that do not regret, it does not invalidate them to me. Just because everybody agrees with something does not mean it is the truth or right. 

3) There is clear propaganda in modern society to glorify abortion as a feminist freedom. 

4) Link me to the verse. Thanks."

It is ok to feel how you feel. You need to forgive yourself, too. Although I personally disagree with abortion (for the most part), I would never sit here and try to make you feel guilty.

There are definitely a lot of women who regret their abortions. I would highly recommend therapy...and you can always send me a measage."

Well, I have not once in my entire time on Reddit seen a positive post about Trump UNLESS it was a specific subreddit like /r/thedonald. This is just one example of liberal media bias.

Of course there are still conservative sources, but to say they dominate is a lie.

The only thing maybe we can both agree on is the possible ""hegelian dialectic"", and you and I are tools of a divide and conquer strategy. In other words, most politicians are on the same team, and we are all the tools.

I am not saying I think Trump is perfect or amazing. He is a good leader though and the country has taken some decent strides with him in office. I think he is smarter than he lets off.

In the end, I do not care too much about politics (as it is a lot like the WWE), because I serve Christ and God. All of this is just dust in the wind.
