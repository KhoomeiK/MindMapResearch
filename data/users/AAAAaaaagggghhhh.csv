depression,ffcompj,t3_esul66,1579803914.0,"Rough stuff. No fun being lost, depressed and anxious.  There are some professionals who could help you. They would need to specialize in this sort of thing, so it wouldn't likely hit the mark if you just randomly pick someone. Look for someone who does work with Axis II and trauma history.  Since you have a PhD in STEM, you could research the literature and explore some less mainstream approaches, such as using oxytocin therapeutically.  The obsessiveness might be treated with inositol- that literature is harder to find but can be done for someone with your resources.  I used to have a collection, that laptop went kaput years ago, though, sorry.  You are absolutely correct that not everything is environmental. That doesn't mean that things are all hard-wired, though. A model that seems to fit better is an interaction where experience acts on the epigenome. This helps to explain the success of some approaches like Acetyl-l-carnitine for depression. I suspect that a multi-modal approach may be most suitable for you, where you are exploring both these hormonal/nutrients/amino acid approaches and working with a therapist that can help you have more satisfying relationships. There are providers who can handle less vanilla lifestyles, they are just harder to find."

depression,ffcdhpl,t1_ffc1jmc,1579797100.0,"It isn't about judging- they need to know these things so that they can do their best to help you, and match the treatment that they think will be most likely to help you. Usually, a multi-modal approach works best, and by that we mean more than one approach. So, after asking you enough to know your situation, you may be getting one or more prescriptions, recommended to therapy- which could be individual, family (so that they can support you), and/or group (so you feel less alone and embarrassed about this and get that you really do have a lot of company, and can work on the more social aspects).  You may be asked to make changes in your eating and/or sleeping habits, if that is warranted.   From what you wrote, it sounds like your body isn't getting the rest and nourishment that is required for health. The brain is a very energy intensive organ, so it often shows the strain, first.  

While you are waiting to be seen, learning more about how all these systems interact may help. This doctor discusses sleep, mood, thyroid, getting vitamin D3, and more. She goes through a lot, and I think that helps to see how things all interrelate: https://youtu.be/xF24xmJQK1k"
milwaukee,ffcc68z,t1_ffc71gj,1579796279.0,"You didn't have to listen to your baby's screams for nearly an hour as the next ER tried and tried to get a vein because by that point she deteriorated during the wait and was far too dehydrated for oral rehydration therapy, anymore.  You didn't have to fight with Children's trying to collect for fraudulent billing that interfered with your credit for over a year. And this woman who just died isn't you, so it must be her own fault, eh? In this thread I see evil, racist, ignorant people.  (If that offends you, then it's you, and only you can fix it and be better. Admitting that you have a problem is the first step). PS, I am white and they would have let my baby die, anyways. But hey, you are all special and nothing like this could happen to you, eh?  Do this- go on and don't believe any of it, and when you have a heart attack go straight to Froedtert. Or St Luke's- I personally knew 2 people who died who should not have, thanks to their ER. Please choose one of these two places - ooh, or Racine! Wonder if they ever got their average wait under 9 hours?  Take your precious baby to the ER at Children's!  Hmmm... and if they are too busy for you, or dismiss your concerns, you just wait there real nice and quiet until your lights are out, don't be one of these uppity people who actually expect to be cared for.

Also be ready with a lost of any medications and supplements that you take, the dosage and how often. It is best to type this and have a copy that can go right in your file.  Your eating and sleeping habits are also relevant. The doctor will want to know what areas of your life are being affected by the depression (school, work, relationships, etc) and the specific symptoms.   Remember that this doctor is a specialist who sees people who are suffering in a similar way every single day. It will be all right."

Then, when you can get transferred to a country that offers health care for all, do it. Don't look back. You're also going to gain 6 weeks of vacation per year, if you have a family then you will get paid leave for months or years. After that, subsidized childcare, and free college for your children, and guaranteed retirement benefits. Best financial decision you could nake, plus you'll gain a few years in lifespan vs. Remaining in the US. 

Make no mistake- here the insurance actually determines access. They deny this, but no medical practice or facility is going to offer you any treatment that your plan won't cover. Then, they will still try to drop you as soon as they can. Your employer will drop you, too.

The waits are because not enough doctors are trained.  We really need to invest in early education and special ed for the gifted. The doctors that we get now are a subset of those who are 1) privileged enough to pay for that education and 2) interested and 3) have the work ethic. That first criterion eliminates a lot of gifted people.

I later learned that some sibs continued to endure nonsense from them after they learned not to try that stuff with me.

It seems like on some level, you definitely know this, yet on another, a superstition is strongly resonating for you.  Thoughts are events that pop up in your mind. They come and go, like the weather. Your mind is like the sky. It hosts these thoughts in one moment, and different ones the next.  It is best not to try to hang on to unhelpful or unhappy thoughts. Let them go on by, like the last set of storm clouds. The thoughts themselves have no more meaning than the weather, either, they are merely events. 

Keep on enjoying your happy memories. Let the memory of your dad's cheers fill all of your senses. Remember what it sounded like, what it felt like, the vibrations on the stage, the scents, the lights, all of it!  Try to make it like you are there again!

Do let others know that you need help. See what services the county has to help you to transition."
depression,fez2mkm,t3_eqyosl,1579453280.0,"I would absolutely love taking art courses and the very last thing that I would care about is the instructor's arm. Cover it if you want, or don't. People may be interested in it and ask, but they know you weren't the artist. Can it be an example of ""art gone wrong"" that you'll eventually remove?  

Because you mention that this has been going on since childhood, I wonder if you have tried Acetyl-l-carnitine? A psychiatrist first told me  about it, then I looked it up in the literature and it is quite legit. I recall that it has been helpful for those with mood issues stemming back to childhood- something about histones, you can look that up if you like. Anyways, 1000 mg of this supplement at night, and 500 mg in the AM can change a person's life. It is also quite robust, and is being applied for a wide range of serious mood issues across the lifespan."
depression,feywdha,t1_fexaf8t,1579451309.0,"This is some outdated misinformation about aging. At the time those stories started, most adults were smokers. Even those who were not still had significant exposure to second-hand smoke, and air quality measures were not made into law, yet.  These things took a toll on the brain- for the whole population, so it appeared to be and was labeled, ""normal aging.""  Now we have new data. Improving throughout life continues, even after age 100. It is only in the last two-six months prior to death that we get what is called, ""terminal drop."" In the meantime, those who actively use their brain, do new things, etc., Continue to get gains that offset the losses. Reaction time may slow a bit for new things (not practiced ones) merely because there is more experience being applied. Gains in vocabulary continue throughout life.  Ok, that's enough school.  Keep growing the brain that you want."
depression,feyugza,t1_fexekeo,1579450672.0,"My pleasure! I should have mentioned ""clean living."" Alcohol and smoking take a toll. I recall two patients in adjacent rooms. One, a lady of 101 who lived a simple life. The other, a 40 year old ""partier."" Guess which one had much better skin?  Right! The 101 year old looked practically radiant.  The partier wore those habits right on her face. It was startling to see."
harrypotterwu,feys60f,t1_fexgynt,1579449934.0,"I did have fun with it for a long while. The frustration eventually built up and now I no longer play.  If you can ignore the issue and have fun with it, then there is a lot to enjoy."
depression,fexfap0,t3_equcf1,1579430055.0,"Ok, a rough start doesn't need to dictate your life, or the end of it.  I did poorly my first semester, then got things on track and eventually earned a doctorate.  Some ideas: 1) get a physician in your new area to take over the prescribing. 2) apply for accommodations with the disability services at your school. 3) look into the counseling services that are available to you at school- you already pay for this.  4) if you cannot initially get the courses that you need, but the professor can allow a late add, pursue that.  5) if #4 doesn't work, find courses online that can fill the gaps in your schedule. 6) forget about the college ""experience."" You are there to get an education. Period.  Put less weight on the social stuff."
depression,fexe31a,t3_equdcl,1579429498.0,"Smile more, even if you don't feel like it.  Our expressions do mold our face. This continues throughout life so if you don't like what's been happening, there are a few things to do. One is adopting a pleasant expression. Often those who are depressed do not do much for self-care. Re-evaluate your skin care routine.  Be sure that your diet nourishes your skin, too, and take the important supplements like Vitamin D3.  These things do make a difference. Not overnight, but in time."
harrypotterwu,fexdbhp,t3_equdrd,1579429083.0,"Yes. You must walk with your phone in the right position, keep it from going to sleep, keep the game open, and guess what?  It still won't count the km properly.  Then, you'll encounter time-limited tasks that require those kms.  Don't expect Niantic to fix this. It has been a very long time and they have not chosen to fix it. So, it is what it is.  

This is what you need to do: decide if that bothers you enough to be a deal-breaker.  If so, delete. If not, then enjoy the game for what it is, and drop all expectations of it working properly. A lot of it goes well, so it's up to you!"
depression,fexcb70,t3_equhh6,1579428529.0,Congrats on getting off FB; I did the same. Your next step is to find your tribe out in the real world. Just keep trying new things that interest you.  For the first time in my life I am no longer surrounded by @holes.
depression,feunt92,t1_fetfuss,1579388354.0,"Good idea. I learned about it from a psychiatrist, then did a literature review"
