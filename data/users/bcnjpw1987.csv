Dreams,ff36ha8,t3_erejp5,1579534835.0,Maybe its telling you to try but be cautious?
Dreams,ff36ft3,t3_erejp5,1579534807.0,Sex dreams? Never have them. Wish cause that would be better than being hurt by the people you loved once over and over for dolls and mannequins being what they are except with lifelike skin.

Katrina_Jade,felv7gz,t1_felpjyb,1579231755.0,"Same. I noticed the same thing. I love her no matter what but like, I just hope life hasnt been real hard for her. Her tweets are confusing."
nwawrestling,felmy2o,t1_feld0yn,1579226024.0,"I wholeheartedly agree with you. Steiner vs Murdoch would be PHENOMENAL. regardless of how I felt through my post, I'm waiting for next week. I love this."
Katrina_Jade,felmqly,t1_felmhzm,1579225883.0,Yeah it's from Twitter.
selfharm,felliy3,t1_feld3xx,1579225049.0,Oh wow. I mean I wish mine could be like that. I do get more anxious about finding like pimples to pop or something. I've noticed.
TooAfraidToAsk,fellfr5,t1_felkbpz,1579224988.0,Haha shed probably laugh a little and/or question why and then I'd probably be seeing someone new the next time üòÇüòÇ
TooAfraidToAsk,feljxwc,t3_epmqq6,1579223976.0,Nah lol I'm crushing on my therapist and shes still new to me. It happens. Its human. But in your case you could have a chance with time and being patient. I cant cause shes my therapist lol
selfharm,felcuac,t1_felcq3m,1579219178.0,Itchy from scabs lol especially when they're pretty deep cuts. They scab up and I scratch them so much they get exposed again lol
selfharm,felchkr,t1_felcfpk,1579218942.0,I think the driving force to avoid it is my arm itches like a mother fucker lol
selfharm,felc5v6,t1_felbxyf,1579218730.0,"I wont. Not at work. If again, it will be at home. But I've been pretty good about avoiding it."
selfharm,felby1y,t3_epre5h,1579218587.0,"I'd talk to them and tell them ""that was out of line."" Like a previous comment had said. Since it's out though, you'll probably have to explain what's happening and you can do it to a degree. You dont have to spill everything. Just slowly let people in since they know and if they care enough, theyll help and/or try and support you through wanting to get better. If they dont? They werent good for you to begin with."
selfharm,felbrvw,t3_epre5h,1579218472.0,That's some bullshit. That shouldnt have happened. I'm sorry this happened.
selfharm,felbkqh,t3_eprqsu,1579218343.0,I feel this. I havent done it again since but I get the urge sooo much and I think about it a lot when I think about my arm or see it when I reach for stuff and its exposed and it doesnt help i work in a kitchen. I would never do this but i think about it.

ElsaJean,fejy3n5,t1_fejxzlg,1579188483.0,Pretty sure she went to twitter with the first pic she put out of them and asked if the fans liked her new tits? Lol I dunno. You decide.
ElsaJean,fejkrqh,t1_fejknpr,1579178210.0,Yeah I think she had them done pretty recently.

TooAfraidToAsk,fe6tksh,t3_cz5ycj,1578904846.0,"honestly I think Billie Eilish is so hated by people because of her popularity and just fast rising to her position. I feel like most of the people that say shit like ""shes just sad"" and shit all the time are the same fuckers that dont really understand the kind of thing shes going through and they are just absolutely careless anyway because why be a good person when you can be a piece of shit on the internet and think no ones gonna care? Her tunes are different but theyre def good. different is what the world needs in terms of music. lets go back to Eminem, do you really want another ""Hi, My Name is?"" because he cant give that to you. I love Billie and I think shes here to stay. shit on my comment all ya want but your negative thoughts will serve literally no relevance while she climbs popularity."
MeganRain,fe69tn5,t1_fe66tdo,1578884993.0,Yeah. One night last week I was wasted and she was on Netflix before going to bed watching Grease.
MeganRain,fe51rtl,t1_fe51csx,1578864909.0,Mhmm. I've sexted with her pretty recently and ended up talking about Grease lol pretty fun girl.

AskReddit,fc58n2t,t3_eg2ei2,1577448770.0,Shes very pretty. I'm attracted to her beyond physical appearance though.
AskReddit,fc58ltp,t1_fc3xh8c,1577448726.0,Lol shes 18 now Chris Hansen is no longer relevant. Like he was to begin with for that matter. He did that whole thing but now there is like 800 of those. Hes gotta be like Chevy Chase now. No money left.
CelebrityTongues,fc58h9m,t3_echz6h,1577448555.0,Mmm. Defo nice tongue.

depression,fc246s5,t1_fc237q4,1577339715.0,:( I'm so sorry. I cried for the last few months and like it slowly got better but I dunno. Distractions have to take place but it's really hard. I hate it. It's still bugging me almost 5 months later.
depression,fc230a8,t1_fc22u4h,1577338360.0,I did and it's just shit. So I just drink. But dont do that. Its not good. Yeah it sounds fishy as hell. He sounds like a snake.
depression,fc22hke,t3_efr7io,1577337781.0,I'm so sorry :( that's gotta be really hard. Its def not easy to move on when they're so close to you like that. He can say stuff like that cause hes already done so but I see that as someone that was just a liar. I was in this a few months ago myself. Almost got a house.
Babybri,fbzm1sa,t3_e3aodo,1577251317.0,I'd eat the fuck outta that
