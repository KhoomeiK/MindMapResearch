EpicSeven,ffj0t7z,t1_ffixr4c,1579987523.0,"\> What incentives does making a pay to obtain ml 5 do they gain. 

What do you mean, what incentive? It's the same incentive as FGO and GBF, and GFL, and SW, and AL etc etc

Once every blue moon, give out a really good deal- that way you get tons of people who otherwise don't spend often to splurge. It's the same reason black Friday is the most profitable day of the year for companies despite the fact that their items are heavily discounted.

\> Also I've played this game since day one as well and this game has only been out for a year so your ""statistics"" doesnt say much. 

Just do the math moron, there's 52 weeks in a year- thus there are 150 GW. Let's give an average and say you earn 50 mystics per GW. That puts you at 7,500, but you need 10,000 for the pity. Which means you need to spend around $250 on mystics packs from there. (technically the rate is .6- so the average would be around 180 pulls, but either way you'd need to spend on mystic packs)

Therefore, my claim that dolphins on average only get 1 ML 5\* per year is correct. 

\> Tell me this game isnt already successful. Because it's already beating its predecessor, and continues to compete with big names like feh, gbf, azure lane. 

LOL, nice fucking meme. FGO makes 50M a month in JP alone, GBF 30M+(Likely around 40-45 but can't get all data because a lot of purchases are done through browser and not app.

I doubt E7 even outearns f2p friendly chibi games like AL and GFL globally. 

\> All your arguement highlights your own entitlement. 

If I was entitled, I would want a free ML. I just want to spend money and actually get something I want for ONCE A FUCKING YEAR. They release 9 ML\*5 per year, paying to pick ONE per year is hardly entitled. Hell, I'd even be satisfied with a ML\*4 purchasable ticket and anniversary.

\>  the player not going to like the dude that purchased a ticket and wake up the next day with everyone hitting a ml jackpot. While people spent hard money or got really lucky get screwed over. 

Everyone who spends gets one, how could anyone possibly be salty?"
EpicSeven,ffiwhfq,t1_ffivpz7,1579984392.0,"\> This isnt a game where you pay 60 dollars on a console kid. It's made to make money because those units are exclusive to the lucky, whales, or both 

""kid"" nice meme

I'm well aware, and I spend several hundred per month on gacha games. It doesn't change the fact that it's way harder to get a limited char you want in e7 than it is in any other mainline gacha game.  

\> Also people dont get ml units once a year that's you being salty at your pulls 

ML 5\* heroes have a drop rate of .6 bro. Do you know what statistics are? A dolphin can get 1 on average one per year. 

Successful games cater to whales AND dolphins at the same time. FGO and GBF actually know how to make real $$"
EpicSeven,ffivb5g,t1_ffiu7xc,1579983586.0,"\> Ok but you dont understand that e7 isnt a regular gatcha, chibi game. This is where entitlement comes.

FGO isn't a regular gacha chibi game and even they do 2 or 3 draw tickets per year that includes the limited pool (thought they're RNG). And they're widely regarded as the greediest MFs in the industry.

\> The purpose of ml is it is extremely rare.

Then why do they add them to the game so often? They're the equivalent of a limited character pool in any other gacha, not some super special rare twice per year unit or whatever.

(also, ML heroes are literally re-using the models of base characters, it's incredibly lazy- the fact that they pass them off as special is delusional. Creating a new hero from scratch is 3x the work of making a ML hero)

Because whales wouldn't spend a kajillion more dollars if they constantly got shafted after whaling."

\> The nonsense is already solved.  

Yes, it is. I never said it wasn't, ALL I SAID was that it would have been resolved faster and with less political division if the issue was framed differently. But I guess you prefer taking the long confrontational route that took longer to give them the same rights?"
UpliftingNews,ffit98p,t1_ffib25g,1579982151.0,"\> In this case, it ""taking so long"" this route was more successful, positively impactful, and shorter than taking the route of calling it something different, with all the cons associated with it. And eventually probably make its way to being called ""marriage"" anyway, but who knows how many decades longer it would take and how many more suicides would have occurred.

Lol. Germany did this exact thing. They went with civil union first and then transitioned it into marriage fairly easily within a few years. All I'm doing is pointing out that the U.S. could have done the same thing and had all this nonsense already solved much easier and with less country splitting division.

And I still don't agree that not being able to call their partnership a marriage would lead to suicides. Only the older generation cares much about marriage, who the hell cares if they can call their partnership a marriage? Not anyone under 30, that's for sure.

And who talks about marriage so much in conversations that it would make them feel isolated/""the other""?

\> They don't want to be different, they don't want to be *separate.* These are the feelings and conditions that degrade their sense of self and quality of life, as demonstrated by the content of this submitted article.

This study has a misleading title, or either they just looked at correlation and not causation. Suicide rates aren't decreasing because of gay marriage laws- they're decreasing because over the last 2 decades, the general populace has become a lot more accepting of gay people which has led to less discrimination.

People being more accepting of gay people is what led to the marriage law, not the other way around."
EpicSeven,ffistgh,t1_ffis4lh,1579981834.0,"How so? Make it fairly cheap so pretty much anyone can get it.

Practically every gacha game on the market does something similar on their anniversary. Either a free ticket or a cheap one so you can at least get one char you want once a year if you have shit luck or can't whale.

I've been playing since launch and I've only gotten one ML\*5 and I had to do the pity banner, and it's not even one I super wanted because they never run the ML banners of chars I want. 

This is the only gacha game I've ever played where the ONLY option to get more than one limited tier character per year you have to mega-whale for mystic purchases"
UpliftingNews,ffgbemv,t1_ffewoe4,1579902527.0,"\> Sounds like the [separate but equal](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/separate-but-equal) argument.

There wasn't anything actually illegal about separate but equal, the problem was that in practice it wasn't ACTUALLY equal. The white governments didn't allocate equal resources or funds to the black communities because of racism.

If whites hadn't been so racist, they would probably still have the segregation they wanted right now, lel

And also, no- it's not really the same thing. Marriage IS a civil partnership, the only difference is the name. A civil partnership would have all the same rights as a marriage.

It's not separate but equal, it's equal but worded differently. lol

Like, if you named de-segregation ""unification"" instead, it still has the same legal changes but just sounds more positive or whatever so it's easier to get the law passed by the general public."
UpliftingNews,ffg9w1d,t1_ffegnji,1579901598.0,"\> So should I just be a good quiet little queer and endure being treated like a second class citizen?

I didn't say that. I was just clarifying on the parent comment's on why change takes so long and there's heavy opposition.

Also I think ""second class citizen"" is a bit of an exaggeration. Being socially ostracized is not the equivalent of systematic legal oppression.

I don't personally care what you do, though a loud  aggressive minority in social movements always alienates the general population. Change would be much easier if social groups collared their extremists and let the moderate ones do the talking."
UpliftingNews,ffegkkm,t1_ffeeh6w,1579847176.0,"What do you mean?

I just think it'd be much easier to convince people of stuff without name calling. Regardless of whether or not it's true, it alienates the person you want to convince.

For example, if I'm trying to convince an anti-vac person they're wrong, and I constantly call them ignorant- more likely than not- they're going to disregard what I'm saying because they'll feel attacked. 

My short-term satisfaction of calling them a moron (the other) isn't worth losing any chance to help them see their wrong-thinking."
UpliftingNews,ffefm6o,t1_ffeeamw,1579846151.0,"\> I see overloaded language there
