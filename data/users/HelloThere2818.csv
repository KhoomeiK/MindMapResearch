Drugs,ffewofu,t1_ffeum78,1579868603.0,Ohhh okay i thought thats what u meant but wasnt sure. Ive been with my mate the last 5 days and he hasnt got it so i think it'll be okay
Drugs,ffeqbar,t1_ffej5ze,1579860179.0,"Yeah it broke and went all over the floor hahaha, i hada walk down the beach and a had a couple of drinks in the more populated bars, then i walked past a bunch of bars and clubs thst had lik 4 people in max, and i was stood around considering whether to go in. And a guy who works in one of them came out and approached me very aggresively shouting something, I had no idea what because ut was in spanish. And i got the fuck out of there haha"
Drugs,ffdbh8d,t1_ffd9gnp,1579817302.0,"With the right people, yeah you're right. 

I bought a bottle of wine at the shop, thought it was a screw on top, walked 1km or so to the beach to drink whilst my mates in bed, and its a fuckin cork, but one thats all in the neck, none of it is sticking out of the bottle. I have 2 options really, leave it, or smash the top off (off the beach for obvious reasons) and filter any glass out with the plastic cups i bought as well. What do i do?"
Drugs,ffd437h,t1_ffd1yca,1579813028.0,"Yeah even now hes watching joe rogan and shit and thinks dmt and stuff is amazing yet he was begging for his truffle trip to end because it was overwhelming. They were the lowest strength ones in the shop fml. Like i dont give a fuck what u learnt about dmt on joe rogan. I honestly wouldn't give 2 shits if it wasnt for him either, but id rather had not had to spend £700+ to go with him to find out. Im sorry for complaining haha but this has truely fucking pissed me off!

Edit: correction - turns out we got dutchii truffles which are some of the strongest you can buy. My mate got them from the shop and asked for something not that strong as it was our first time and she gave him the strongest ones they had the dutchii hollandia hahaha ffs"
Drugs,ffd2u0r,t1_ffd1pc7,1579812316.0,"I didnt really have a choice, our families are good friends so i couldnt leave him haha, and we were in our hotel room. I dunno whether i told her because i was concerned, it was more to do with the fact he was choosing not to talk to me for 6 hours because he was overhwhelmed and 'scared' (his words) by the trip. If youve only smoked weed before it is certainly overwhelming, I get that, it was for me, but 1. you know its gonna end eventually. 2. You might as well have a laugh and enjoy it until it does end.

Ah thats good :D, I will come to Berlin on my next trip this summer, I'll bring my other mate though, we'll probably do a road trip."
Drugs,ffd1br6,t1_ffczs7f,1579811467.0,"I spent like £700 on this trip so far and ive barely enjoyed any of it and not because of the drugs, theyve been great, but it seems even the best of drugs wont make you feel good when you got shit company. I have 2 more days left in barca but quite honestly id rather fuck off home now and go to bristol where my radge cunt mate is and have an actual good time for less than £30."
Drugs,ffcwric,t1_ffct86y,1579808884.0,"Haha thanks! We considered it but i dont know any German which put me off, are people bothered about that in Berlin? 

Also our third and last day we had magic truffles at like 2pm which ended up a fucking nightmare. Dont get me wrong i thought the trip was epic, but my mate turned himself into a cocoon in his bed listening to kanyewest 'so he can keep track of the time', im like just look at the fucking clock haha. I spent 6 hours of my day trying to get him to talk to me but he wouldn't. Ended up texting his sister that he wont talk to me, she told his parents and they were worried about him and trying to ring him. But the idiot put his phone on aeroplane mode so no one could talk to him. At 8/9 pm i wanted to go out for drinks and stuff, i was still tripping a bit but it was wearing off. He just kept saying 'I dont feel like myself yet, im not in full control' and neither did I tbh but thats the fun of it. Im questioning whether this guy has even been properly properly drunk before, doesnt seem like it to me. 3 days in dam and didnt go out once, was in bed at 11pm every night. Soooooo fucking shit, wasted my fucking money. 

Am now in Barcelona for the first night and again this guy wont come out for drinks and go to clubs because hes still tired and has a headache from the truffles apparently, im here with mumps ffs my neck is swollen af and hurts like a mutha fucker so i feel like I have the right to call this guy a bitch."

I on the other hand dont, because as far as im concerned aslong as its not gonna kill me i dont care, i dont do any drugs or drink often enough or that is hardcore enough for it to be a problem imo. Also i threw up at 2am, so I guess I had too much as well, but atleast I wasnt a bitch about it u know what i mean?"

depression,ff1hrlc,t3_eqyyej,1579479430.0,"I think depression and stuff makes some people more empathetic. Something I used to lack before the age of like 18-19. Now my parents have to tell me to not be taken for a mug, like if i buy friends food and stuff and tell them they dont need to pay me back. Its not because im loaded because im not (i got 2k in my bank) but i appreciate friendship and sharing my time with people I care about. I value that more than money.

The other day this girl I work with had spilled a carton of milk on the floor (i work in supermarket) as I finished my shift, had my coat on and was about to walk out. I stayed behind 10 minutes to help her clean it up. Now just a few weeks ago this same girl was taking the piss out of me and practically calling me retarded I guess because I have some cognitive dysfunction from mental illness and I cant be quite slow to respond or react if it requires thought ie my reaction times whilst driving are fast, but reading or taking in what some one says to me I find hard sometimes. So i had a choice: I could go home, which I can guarantee anyone else who works there would have done; or I could help her clean it up. In the end it was empathy that made up my mind. I thought how I would feel in her shoes, nobody helping me and having to clean it up infront of everyone and it was probably a bit embarrassing, so I helped her out. She was appreciative of it, and I could tell because she thanked me for it and shes nice to me at work now. 

Im not the biggest giver to charity, i'll admit, im not interested in if old people get there tv licenses (uk thing) paid by the government or not, or whether there are stray dogs that need a new home in sudan or some shit like that. Ive bought homeless people food before, ive volunteered at a disabled football club, i have given to charity also, im not tight, but you cant give money to every cherity that asks for it obviously.

I also wouldnt say I was damaged particularly, just was unlucky genetically I think, and the chemicals in my brain are pretty fucked lol."

socialskills,fextocf,t3_eqhohr,1579435896.0,"Nice on dude, wish I did this when I was living in the city for uni, there was this girl id see in there most days and shed smile at me and id smile back but I never had the guts to talk to her. This was last year, im 21 now. At home my gym is small and theres no attractive female regulars besides the ones that come in with bf's. Anyway, well done man!"
depression,fexl7wn,t1_fex173x,1579432819.0,"Well dont let it be the once, keep going. One of the girls at work didnt use to like me and took the piss out of me for whatever reason, i think cognitive dysfunction from depression mostly, like my response time was slow, and shed take the piss practically calling me retarded. But i carried on being nice to her and compassionate, like one day last week for example, at the end of my shift she spilt a carton of milk all over the floor. I had my coat on and was heading out the door, most people at work would have just laughed and gone home but i helped her clean it up. I didnt have to, but I guess since having depression im more empathetic, i think about what its like to be in others shoes, how would i feel in that situation etc etc. Its kinda funny coz she always talks to me at work now and is super nice, a bit sarcy but thats expected. So i guess what im trying to say is sometimes you have to go out of your way to build friendships and relationships. Obviously I havent got where I want to be yet but I definitely think it has helped more than just being the guy who walks by (in the milk incident). Actions speak louder than words and all that"
depression,fevh98r,t3_eqm12f,1579397408.0,"Just keep trying dude. Im 21, i started a new job in september and I was shy as fuck, I wouldnt have a conversation with someone unless they spoke to me first. Now I talk to everyone first. Theres 2 girls at my work I talk to a lot. One of them started like 2 months after me, and I was the first person to talk to her (of the regular staff. Obviously the managers ahd interviewed her and given her an induction and stuff before this). No one was really talking to her, I remember I was shitting brix coz I knew I had to talk to her first (more of a personal goal than an actual reason to talk to her first, like to prove to myself that i can be confident enough i suppose). I did an alright job and realised it wasnt that scary or bad at all. Although she doesnt like like me, it makes my day when I make her smile. Its funny coz she looks miserable as sin at work most the time bless her, but then sometimes we make eye contact across the room, like she'll be serving someone on the tills/checkout and i'll be filling a shelf or something or walking by and we make eye contact for like a second and i'll be grinning already and then I dont stop looking at her eyes until shes smiling, which usually is like a second or two. 

Obviously I cant talk really coz im in the same boat, but i think its important to take interest in the girls life. Like at work everyones always chatting to each other but its always meaningless stuff, like stuff about work, or how much they hate it, or some stupid gossip about old marys sisters, daughters, cats, brothers, owners, next door neighbors, Fred and Sally that means nothing. For example this girl at work was off for a week because she was going on holiday to london with her family. Nobody else asked her when she was next in, so nobody knew (besides managers) that she wasnt in next week because she was on holiday. And so when she was back the week after nobody asked her how her trip was or what she got up too, but I did, she seemed suprised I asked (or remembered more likely) and I could tell she was happy someone asked and she enjoyed telling me what she got upto.

As for the people on here saying it wont cure your depression or that its sad for that to be your only goal. I do get what they are saying. But at the same time I think its a bit ignorant. It's easy for people to say relationships arent that important whe  theyve been in one or several. Obviously you can work on yourself everyday of the week. I have a 2:1 BA law degree, so clearly girls arent my only goal. But its moments like my graduation where it would be nice to have a partner or someoen close (besides your parents) to share it with. 

Happiness is only real when shared after all. Sorry for the long post, hangout with her out of work, and talk more and be a sarcastic fuck but in a jokey way not an arsehole way, its a fine line. If teh woman is what u desire then claim your prize."

Theres so many people I care about and would give my last pence and last breath for, yet they all just forget about me as soon as the night or the shift at work or whatever, is over.

depression,femll2g,t3_epxpfw,1579261520.0,"Yup, its very weird, when i was like 12-16 I didnt get it, like i just said the regular meme shit oh they just want attention blah blah blah, i guess karma hit me real hard. Im now 21 and just been fuked the last 5 years from depression and anxiety. I cant remember what its like to feel normal. The only taste of that I had was when i did coke a few times last year. All my racing and negative thoughts stopped. My mind was clear of the usual fog that clouded my mind and decreased my cognitive function, i wasnt worried about the future and my career or missing my train in the morning, or not waking up to my alarm, or what i was gonna buy in the shops or any of the usual shit that stresses me out for no fuckin reason. As nice as it was its just chemicals, and coke in the long run was not gonna make things better for me.

My parents also dont get it, they think im just a bit sad occasionaly, little do they know how i feel every waking moment. They tell me not to be negative and feeling sorry for myself, which I dont anyway, at the time it feels like im just being realistic i suppose. Negative thoughts is something I can't control, like i dont choose to feel hopelessness.

One day I can be very positive and quite calm and level headed, ie looking for jobs and actually believing i could do it. But then an hour or so later im just overwhelmed with negative thoughts out of nowhere, i no longer think i can do the job, i have brain fog and negative thoughts, which makes me kinda slow and unmotivated. All of a sudden i feel hopeless again out of no where.

I honestly dont know how you can describe it to your parents, its hard, but maybe just try writing out what you feel, as I just did briefly, and maybe let them read it or something. I feel like whenever i try to talk to them i miss key points out and also they interrupt and try and give me a solution to everypoint i make like saying i need more sleep or more exercise (even though i go gym 5 days a week) or i need more fruit or fresh air  is one i get a lot *face palm emoji*, but what i want is for them to understand not try and give me a solution or downplay what im saying as a normal thing, because nothing about depression feels normal."

You have to fill in a little questionnaire to get it, cant remember whats on it exactly, one question asks what kind of cough you have and you choose the dry cough option, as opposed to chesty mucousy cough. You also tick that your not allergic to it, youve had it before, and that you will tell your doctor you have it if it's necessary, i.e if your doc prescribes you with something that you shouldnt take with codeine i would guess. Theres a couple of sites that will sell it if you do the little questionnaire thing, you just cycle between them becaise they only sell one bottle a month or some shit like that.

I went on christmas day and he wasnt online. He never came back online. I dont think he died, he most likely got an xbox one or ps4 or something. I still go on my ps3 every so often to see if he replied to me yet. But its been 4 years now. I doubt hes coming back. I guess thats just it, he could be dead for all I know, but I will always miss him and the fun we had together for as long as i remember. So i guess in a way you should tell them, because you never know what friendships mean to other people, and how emotionally invested they are in a friendship. So in my case i was emotionally invested, our friendship and playing together meant a lot to me. Maybe it did to him but clearly not as much as it did to me, or he would have told me he got a ps4 or whatever.

So basically i have 11 days to ask her out. I have nothing to lose, because once she finishes work we probs wont see each other again (we live in different towns) as friends.

depression,fdc9svx,t3_ekh6lr,1578269931.0,"Ahh but the thing is if someone brings you up to the point where youre pretty neutral/ maybe slightly down, and then they disappear, then you gonna be below where you were to start. So i started a new job in September, everyday i drove to work and wanted to kill myself, id think about crashing into walls that i passed as i sped along country roads at like 80mph. Most of the people at work are 30+, im 21, and most gad worked there 4+ years and had lived in the town all there lives so they had established lives, families, friends etc outside of work and I dont. I got on with people well but thats no life, to just get on with people. Anywho, it gets to november, this new girl starts, super hot imo and just a couple years younger than me. I start talking to her on her first day, introducing myself and asking about her life (something ive never really done or been good at due to social anxieties. But at this point i literally had nothing to lose) and we became quite close, we have good banter at work and stuff. Over christmas i have become too emotionally invested in her for sure, where shes the only thing that makes me feel happy. So last week she and a few others were told their contracts wont be extended (they were pretty much recruited for xmas), so they finish on the 18th of January. When i heard this it literally took my breathe away, my heart literally started pounding, youd think i was the one being made unemployed. I dont know how I will cope, all I want to do is move out of my parents house to a shitty appartment so i can just fucking sedate myself half the day and be a corporate slave the other half until my untimely death!

One of the best days ive had i went to a water park and my friends, sister's, french exchange came, we had a great time we had a hard time understanding each other but it made it more fun, then me and her went to an italian restaurant after and had wine which was great. Dunno what it is about european girls, i guess its like the more simple conversation makes it so much easier. When im with people outside of my house im generally not sad, on the occasion i am not right I just say im tired and its no biggy. But part of my depression i think is that i dont have anyone, and the realisation that i have no one makes me worse. If im sad i dont really hang out with people. Im either in the mood to socialise or im not.

I dipped my toes with drugs at uni, it was pretty fun tbh and im certainly not against it, but understand the need to be responsible about it, like anything from drinking to cliff jumping. I dont really talk about myself irl, at work im asking everyone else. Its weird because when people tell me they are going on holiday at work i always remember where they are going and stuff theyve told me they are gonna do, and i wish them a good trip there last shift before they go and when they get back i ask them about it. Seems like pretty normal stuff yet no one ever asks me or remembers (or even cares) what ive been doing. Honestly i dont get why i cant make friends or have a partner, like im pretty sure im not weird, i dont say weird stuff, i dont think im that bad looking either and I go to the gym and am pretty shredded (really not trying to blow my own trumpet here haha).

Before i started this job in September i was very very shy, i wouldnt speak to people unless they spoke to me, i had pretty bad social anxiety. But the more i talked to people the easier it got. Anyway, i often stay back like 10-15 minutes after my shift to talk to people, because i know as soon as i leave the building im gonna be alone until the next day. I had this issue at school as well, where id consider people friends, but then to them i was just an acquaintance. I really dont know what i have to do for people to consider me a friend. After Christmas at work i was sharing out sweets with the people i talk to most. If someone did that to me id be very grateful that they had the kindness to share with me (they dont though), but for everyone else it was like meh, its a sweet, and forgotten about in a minute. For me its the act i value not the thing thats given. I definetley value the time spent socialising at work more than everyone else. When they finish they all go back home to there partners or to hang out with there mates.

Also we live in a fucking village, which i think has had a negative effect on my social life. Where my friends from school would be going out every night, i simply couldnt because i couldnt get a fuckin lift. My dad goes on about how much he went out and socialised with friends and stuff in his teens and early 20's and wonders why i dont.

Makes it pretty impossible to set up a date or get to know them at all and i dont really know what im meant to do about that."

Anything i do thats meant to be fun i feel nothing, i am never satisified that i made the most of whatever im doing. Im 21, my parents are telling me to save for a house, but its gonna be like 3 decades before that happens. What do i do in between. Theres things i want to do but i have no one to do them with, places i want to go but no one to go with."
depression,fclncez,t1_fckbz39,1577751843.0,"Same, started when i was 15, went to uni when i was 18, halfway through first year, I was being abused by girls i lived with (I accidently moved into 'the hood' building) and I couldnt do anything because they were drug delaers and had there gangster wannabe arseholes whod probably stab me if I did anything. I'd stay in my room if I knew they were around as running into them would ruin my whole damn week. Sometimes id be in my room for days, maybe just with water and a bag of 6 apples. I lost so much weight and never managed to put it back on to this day (im now 21) because of crippling depression and anxiety. Oh well"

depression,fcahwg3,t1_fcaf747,1577569530.0,"Cool, i go to the gym often as well, im very into bodybuilding and stuff. About 5 years ago I used to go to the gym with a girl from my school, she was hot and she proper liked me, i liked her. Until everyone found out she was fucked with a chocolate bar haha (not by me) and I got roasted for months for it which kinda turned me off her, which was my problem really. In the same scenario now I wouldnt care because im not at school. Whats PT anyway? Personal training? I do want to start boxing and have done the last 6 years but never had the guts to go myself. I hope I can make it happen in the new year. Ive been better with doing stuff out of my comfort zone, iv always been anxious of going to work everyday, id be anxious about my alarm not waking me up, sometimes to the point where i wouldnt sleep, i was anxious of catching the train, or talking on the phone, or doing stuff like going to the dentist myself, or initiating conversation with new people. At work ive been making calls and stuff recently, and ive been making a big effort to talk to everyone and all the new staff and things, and am getting better at not being anxious about going to work all the time im not at work."
Drugs,fc97vfz,t3_egmxrg,1577548432.0,"I've done ket once lol, I was drunk af, i had drank a 70cl bottle of vodka with a bottle of robinsons orange squash, literally going 1/2 a cup of vodie and the other half orange squash. I was experimenting trying to find the best mix. If you use water the vodka is too strong, if u have to much squash the squash is too strong etc etc, so i drank it 50/50. Then I did ket for the first time (it was my friends 21st). We were going out to some event at the O2 academy in Oxford. We were walking through this park in the city about 15 minutes after doing it and I had a fight with a tree, with my mate who was also ketty. Then i tried to rugby tackle a tree and my samsung galaxy s9+ which was in my pocket got bent, oops. My mate also rugby tackled the tree. We were round the corner from the O2 academy at an ATM. I tried to get money out but the machine broke and swallowed my debit card. I went in the shop and told them, they didnt giv a fuk and told me to ring the number on the atm. I go outisde to the atm, got my phone out and realised it was bent and therefore not working. I was fucking raging, i fully snapped my phone in half against a wall and tried to ride one of the many bikes dumped across the city which you have to pay for to make the peddles turn. I fell off it and ended up throwing it in a bush. I was in the O2 academy for about 2 minutes. I couldnt find anyone I knew so I went straight back out loool. Our group were actually all in there besides my mate who I was fighting trees with, because he had left his ID somewhere and passed out in a bush. I was trying to find my friends accommodation, but as i didnt remember the walk to the O2 academy from his place, I ended up walking around the city aimlessly. It was in november so it was cold af and I was in a tshirt. I thought I was gonna die. I had a shit in a bush next to a bus stop. Somehow I survived the night and made it back go my mates accommodation after randomly coming across someone I had met earlier in the night. In the morning my mates shoulder was purple and green, looked like someone had chucked a fucking boulder at him. But someone told us we were fighting trees. Which I didnt really remember. My train tickets were on my phone so I couldnt go home, and I couldnt buy more tickets as Id lost my card, i also projectile vomited which was bright orange from all the squash, but it was hilarious. Id rate the night a 1/10 but I do want to do ket again, preferably not when its cold af or in a city I dont know or not after 70cl of vodka"
depression,fc926h6,t3_egpzfo,1577545824.0,"Sounds like me but im 21 and not had a realtionship in over 21 years. Well done on creating a friendship group though, thats something Ive been unable to do since leaving school. Everyone just forgot about me, they all had there friendship groups. But I wasnt apart of them. I also have anxiety and also depression, and I cant figure out why, theres a few little things that contributed, but theres no specific or traumatic events I can pinpoint as the cause. At work girls take the piss out of me for being slow (despite having a BA Law degree). They take the piss but no one thinks why it might be, or asks if im alright. Basically depression and anxiety has destroyed my brain, I find it hard to think and concentrate and can barely put a sentence together half the time."
relationship_advice,fc8wkyu,t1_fc8pp5y,1577543205.0,"Yeah apparently so, but the fact most of them have kids I'd have thought theyd be like hell no. Well I found out today almost half the staff at work are being let go in the new year, shes one of them and im not. So i'll never see her anyway. As sad as it is im somewhat relieved because it sets the answer to my question in stone, like it wont even be an option now, so theres nothing to think about."
relationship_advice,fc8fug9,t1_fc75nsg,1577533986.0,"Oh, it would be a weird joke though wouldnt it. Well I found out today like half the staffing are being let go at the start of the new year. Im being kept on but most of my friends are leaving, so i'll probably quit not long after. Only thing keeping me here was the people (and the job is also a doss)"
relationship_advice,fc6u4ep,t1_fc6ryy1,1577489549.0,"Ahhh okay, when you say physical do you mean just the deed, or like no kissing, holding hands or any kind of physical contact? If its the former, then id be fine, its been like 3 years already haha, I doubt she would like that though. Just curious, but do you think it would have been any different if the legal age was 16? You say you dont have many common interests and stuff, was that actually because of age or just her? Obviously age restricted events makes sense as being an issue, though this girl already goes to 18+ events anyway, in the UK bouncers have a tendency to ID the guys and just let the girls in. Its weird lol"
relationship_advice,fc6qlji,t1_fc6gko3,1577486984.0,"Okay, i hear what youre saying, but why is it going to warp her mind? When I was 16 I lost my v card to a 19 year old, she was at uni I was at sixth form(college), we went out for a bit, I just knew her from nights out, like we werent even friends first. It didnt warp my mind either and neither of us had figured out who, what, when, where ,or why? Like who has figured that stuff out besides maybe elon musk. Im not disagreeing with you by any means, im just trying to find where peoples opinions are coming from"

relationship_advice,fc6o7g9,t1_fc6d8ni,1577485287.0,"Sounds like a plan. My gut instinct says no all day long, as I've said in other replies, my coworkers responses just kind of threw me, like theyre mostly 30+ in age and they were egging me on saying I should ask her out. Which was not what I expected them to be like about a rumour about me liking a 16 year old"
relationship_advice,fc6nses,t1_fc6dm4f,1577484990.0,"So I take it you're from the Uk or Aus or something right? Tbh i think I should just be friends with her, and hangout as friends, I like her company but i think i need to rebuild my social circle after the shit show that was uni. Anyway, about the being single for life part, theres always some dumb ass stupid shit that has stopped me having relationships in the past, like the last girl i was kinda close to I had to cancel a date because I got colombian flue, I was properly ill for like a week I felt so bad that was like the biggest dick move I've ever done i think. The girl before, I met in the gym, turned out she was at my school. But then everyone in the school found out she was fucked with a chocolate bar by some lad, and I just got fuckin roasted for months (it wasnt me that did it btw) it took a toll on my mental health tbh, I tried to not let it bother me, but after months it kinda turned me off her (because I wanted to eat the chocolate bar loool, jokes). The one that you did date, did people know your ages or did you kinda keep it quiet? If they did know what was there reaction. All the US replies are saying its not acceptable, people ive asked in the uk say its no biggy, and the aussie and brits on here seem to say its not a mssive deal but probs not the best idea."
relationship_advice,fc6lz5n,t1_fc6dvla,1577483721.0,"Thanks for a level headed british response lol and not a typical 'shes under 18 pedo' response, I definitely agree with what you're saying, I think waiting is the best thing to do, like u said its not a race, so I will just enjoy being friends :)"
relationship_advice,fc6l3mt,t1_fc6e7vj,1577483131.0,"Last week we went to a bar (just with friends) she didnt get ID'ed, I got ID'ed for a fuckin pepsi max haha fml. I hear what youre saying anyway and think we should stay friends if she was 17 and nearly 18 or older then id be okay with that, but 16 is too young. Can I ask though, did this guy get shit for dating a 16 year old? Or did he not tell anyone? Or did people just not care? The reaction of the people at work when the woman started the rumour suprised me a lot, because at the time my opinion was that I was practically being accused of being a pedo, but then everyone was being really nice and telling me she's really nice and they think we'd be good together and stuff, and it was totatlly not what I expected. I guess i should stick to my gut instinct, i generally have a pretty good moral compass."
relationship_advice,fc6i9mb,t1_fc6g1a9,1577481217.0,"I said it, because it can be fact, people develop at different rates, peoples upbringings and life experiences can have a big impact on their maturity and mental wellness.

relationship_advice,fc6hod5,t1_fc6cvl7,1577480817.0,"Yeah it seems people from the states are very against it. Understandably, as there is the ethics of the fact its illegal there, and I get theres a reason for there being that law in place. However most of Europe, is like 16 I think (considering I did law I dont know much law, oops). So in that sense theres LESS of an ethical issue as its not illegal, having the law at 18 creates a solid boundary. Its black and white. But anyway yeah I think waiting is the best thing to do, and then If we've both moved on by then then so be it, and if we havent then yeah, cool."

Like a few months ago I blocked a girl on tinder whos profile said she was 18 but then she said she was 17, and I thought that was too young. I guess I just need to stick with my gut instinct and dont let others influence my thoughts."
depression,fbr8cd2,t3_ee8017,1577040372.0,"I did that in 2nd and 3rd year (I just finished with a 2:1 this last summer). However, I didnt do any reading around the subject. I left all my assignments until the last day, because id be so stressed about it i couldnt focus (not that I can anyway) I think i als9 subconsciously buried it in my mind because thinking about it stressed me out. I think the fact i couldnt focus stressed me more and made me be able to focus less. As the deadlines closed in I'd get what feels almost like an adrenaline rush. My fear of failure would cause this and id realise if i didnt start now i'm fucked. This was usually about 9pm the night before. Id get a 4 pack of red bull and crank out the words all night long. Get like 3 hours of kip, eat some fruit, drink more redbull, maybe a few double espresso shots and finish it by my 6pm deadline. If you cant focus you cant focus, you just gotta realise how fucked you are if youd dont do it, and whilst you do it nothing else matters. Ive missed trains even my best mates 18th party because I keft my assignment to the last minute. But it was a worthy sacrifice in the end. You can atleast do one of them, thats better than doing neither. Also use your word count minimum boundary. i.e. at my uni you could have 10% more or less words than the essay brief. So 3k words, thats 300 less before you start losing marks for it, so 2.7k is the minimum. I dont know how you react to caffeine, but it wakens me up to be able to work better. Ngl I could not do 6k words in 24 hours. I think 4k would be my limit, mainly because I do all my reading whilst I write it. When I start I probs know about 10% at most of what I need to know. Also listening to soundtracks and stuff helps me, like movies ost's from the revenant, interstellar, or inception, or from games like skyrim and minecraft, even just white noise airplane noise on youtube I find helps as well as maybe rain or thunderstorms (i dunno what youd like), or songs like watering a flower by haruomi hosono. I have crazy racing thoughts and axiety all day long, and i find this stuff clears my head of all the shite going through it. I hope you find something that works for you. Good luck!"
