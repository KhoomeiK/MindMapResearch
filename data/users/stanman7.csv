If you look at the article linked below it basically says scientists are debating the role of igG in food sensitivity, and that it only works if you've ingested the item for your body to create the antibody. However scientists/doctors do agree there is such a thing as igG and that it likely plays a role in food sensitivity. Moreover the blood test does find these antibodies, and may help you identify foods you hadn't thought of eliminating.
