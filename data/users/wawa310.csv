datingoverforty,ff70iux,t3_erzoii,1579638683.0,"This reminds me of a guy who sent me a weird text a few weeks after a date like ""why haven't I heard from you?"" which was kind of odd because I hadn't heard from him either. I told him because I didn't have a good time on the date, he was 45 minutes late, and when he did show up he was very drunk. Then he tried to debate me on these facts (""I wasn't drunk and it seemed to me like you were having a good time""). It was silly. I just let it go after that. When someone tells you they don't want to see you again, there is no point in trying to debate them about their reasoning."

How they communicate, how they organize, can you rely on them, do their actions match their words. The first date is basically a screener, I wouldn’t put too much thought into it and I definitely would not let it go on all day. Save the all day dates for your 2nd date or later. Good luck!"

If you want to shake things up a bit, I vote for getting the girl’s # and chatting on the phone before scheduling a meetup. My big issue with the apps is a lack of humanity, which is why I think there is so much flaking / ghosting / etc. If you can hear each other’s voices, and chat a bit, you have established that you are two human beings and I think people tend to treat each other more kindly after that. You can schedule the date on the phone too."

Don’t be afraid to look him in the eye and great him if you are in a meeting together. Don’t cower away from your responsibilities if he is somehow involved. You have a job to do.

I think that’s the only way to maintain your sanity at work, and possibly your job. Over time, it will get easier. But really the most important thing you need to do is make sure this situation isn’t affecting your performance at work.

I think you can figure this out by going at your own pace with what you are comfortable with. If you back off and the love bomber disappears - then that's your answer. If you back off and the person sticks around and is comfortable at going at your pace - then there's something more. 

Right now I backed off b/c it was going too fast and I wasn't ready for so much so fast, and he is 100% on board with that. This was an actual conversation we had, not just me not texting him back or playing games or something like that. I don't know what's going to happen in the long run, but this definitely feels like the right thing to do."
datingoverthirty,fdkokks,t1_fdjzwy2,1578507890.0,"Yes, an emotional affair is cheating. And there are also people who prefer non-monogomous relationships and wouldn't have an issue with that situation at all. 

My point is that by focusing on what is objectively RIGHT and WRONG is missing the mark. If something doesn't feel right FOR YOU, then you deserve to address the issue respectfully with your partner. Even if the person isn't doing anything objectively wrong, the way both people handle that conversation is important.

For example, what if OP brings this up to her BF and finds out he wasn't with the ex at all. In fact, he was helping his Grandma. In that case, he's not doing anything objectively WRONG, but the way he handles the conversation still matters. Does he yell at her / shut down / tell her she's being too sensitive? How about how does she handle the situation? Does she tell him he's morally wrong for spending time with the ex and gives him an ultimatum? The way two people treat each other in a relationship matters and the way they address their own feelings and boundaries also matters."

Plenty of other people are commenting that they have healthy and happy relationships with their exes and they’re also right.

I think in a relationship if you go into an argument focused on who is objectively right, then you might win in an online poll or something, but you’re not going to make things work with that person. 

Also there are plenty of things that your partner could do that aren’t objectively wrong, but could still make you feel bad, and you deserve to care about those things too."
datingoverthirty,fdjdt0p,t3_elomyv,1578466657.0,"Your feelings are valid and they matter. 

Whether he objectively “should” or “shouldn’t” be spending time with an ex isn’t necessarily the issue.

The fact is that he wants to spend time with her, he is indeed spending time with her, and he hid that from you. I don’t think the relationship is necessarily over because of this, but I think you both need to recognize the issue and address each other’s feelings.

There are a lot of possible solutions here, but I think really what you want to pay attention to is how does he act towards you while having this conversation?"

datingoverthirty,fdeirvi,t3_ekvock,1578339909.0,"I (36F) have no issues with exclusivity, and actually in the last 5 years or so, I'm actually much more open minded to not being exclusive as well. If I'm seeing someone I like, no problem for me to focus on them. It's not like I love being on the apps and going on first dates so much that I feel like I'm missing out on anything.

If the person I'm seeing wants / needs to date other people while also dating me in order to figure out if they really want to be with me long-term - I'm actually also all for that. Why rush into something only to find out later that the person felt pressured and/or isn't really into me to begin with? 

What's more important to me is figuring out do we want the same things in life? Are we on a similar path, where we could be compatible long-term? If a guy wants to bang a bunch of chicks while the two of us work on that stuff, go for it (within reason, of course).

However, I'm not interested in sleeping with someone who is also sleeping with other people. At this point in my life, that's not a health risk I'm willing to take."

You may or may not hear from him again. I don't think I heard from my ex for over a year after we broke up. I think I had reached out to him first. You can \*always\* reach out to him if you want to, although I would not recommend doing that! At least not for a little while. I can promise you that no amount of reaching out to him will ever be satisfying. 

I try to think of my exes like my neighbors. I can reach out to my neighbors if I need something (like help opening a jar, which I just asked a neighbor to help me with), and I might run into my neighbors when I'm not expecting to, but I can also go a long time without seeing them and that's fine too.

BreakUps,fcv8hnc,t3_ej0l3a,1577996840.0,"This happened to me and I'm really sorry this happened to you too.  

This is my story:

It was 10 years ago and I was 27, he was 35. We were together for 2 years and I loved him more than I remember ever loving anyone. I thought everything was great, he had bought a house, we were talking about getting married. Then totally out of the blue, no fighting, nothing, he told me he had an ""uncontrollable urge for freedom"" and the rest of this conversation is blurry b/c it was 10 years ago and I stopped really listening after that point. I think he mentioned wanting to take a break so he could be with other people. I remember asking if we can take a break and \*not\* see other people, at least for a week? And he said no, he needed his freedom right away. Then I remember asking him ""OK, so just so we are clear, you know that I don't want this, right?"" and he said yes. I said something like ""OK well then it seems like you have made up your mind, please get your things and leave."" I also remember him saying something like ""I realize I might be making the biggest mistake of my life."" The conversation took 10 minutes. 10 minutes to end a 2 year relationship. I did not cry at all while this was happening.

He stayed in touch for a few years, I stayed in touch too. Just meeting for coffee about twice a year or so. 

3 years after we broke up, he wanted to get back together. I said no thank you. I no longer had any feelings for him and the thought of even kissing him churned my stomach. He got angry and tried to start a fight, which was just totally absurd to me. We had never fought when we were dating. He said something like ""why didn't you fight harder for us when we were together?"" which is crazy to me, because I had no idea that I needed to fight for anything. The only time he told me anything was wrong was when he broke up with me. He called me and apologized a few months after that. 

A few years after that he tried again. I remember at one point he said I had been leading him on, but I hadn't been reaching out to him, just accepted to meet him for coffee. None of this makes any sense, I realize, but that's what happened. I also remember hearing from 2 separate friends that he had told them I was the love of his life and he made the biggest mistake of his life. 

Then, around 2 years after we broke up, he asked to meet for coffee and I did see him. I explained that I was in a new relationship, and that I wasn't interested in getting back together, but I wanted to understand from his point of view what happened between the two of us. I didn't argue, I didn't interrupt him, I just listened.

What he told me was that he had loved me and he did see himself marrying me, but he had to ""sow his wild oats"" (by banging a bunch of women), which he did. And then after he was done doing that, he wanted to get back together. I mean, really, that was it. He apparently had no problem with our relationship, he just wasn't ready to commit to one woman for the rest of his life and bailed.

Last I heard from him was 2 years ago (a year after that convo). That was just an email asking to get together. I said no hard feelings, but no thanks.

This is my best description of what actually happened. On the inside, there was a whole other world of stuff going on. I felt like I was having an out of body experience, I was so hurt, it took me YEARS to trust anyone. I was so MEAN to the men I dated after him, because I felt like I couldn't trust anyone. I was punishing other people for what he did to me. I was also punishing myself, I felt like I couldn't trust myself to make good decisions. Through yoga, meditation, therapy, religion, volunteer work, and several relationships with other men who weren't perfect either, but each had their own issues, I've grown so much. I'm not perfect, I'm trying, every day is a new struggle. I'm recently single again (UGH), but I'm proud of who I am and happy with the choices I've made. 

Good luck to you. No matter what ends up happening - this will be a huge learning experience for both of you. My best advice is take the good and leave the bad. It's going to be a wild ride. Enjoy what you can when you can, and try not to take your pain out on anyone else. This journey is no longer about him, now it's about you. <3"
