About 6 months ago I made the mistake of taking her to the hardware store with me and from then on she was literally at my feet anytime I stood up. If I went to the garage, she blocked my path.
I finally figured out how to train her. If I go out and jingle my keys really hard, she comes running knowing that she’s going for a ride. Makes leaving the house any other time easier.
She does get a ride every weekend I’m home though, even if it’s a short trip around the neighborhood. 
She even got to go to [work](https://imgur.com/a/RmZ4QNZ) with me one Sunday when I was able to leave from home and come back the same day."

A couple of my distant cousins are runners, I was friends with them on Facebook and occasionally interacted with them. Once I started running I asked them a couple basic questions and they were excited to discuss and give any advice. 
This past weekend I finally posted a progress picture [(I’m the old guy)](https://imgur.com/a/fxQh17f) and mentioned my running and there have been a couple other friends that are runners that have talked to me now through messenger. 
Strava app allows you to see local runners as well. You might find someone there to either help, or run with a similar pace. 
Best of luck along your journey!"
running,fck3l5m,t1_fck2q4q,1577715566.0,"Wasn’t meaning immediately, was just saying that you should go out and run. Enjoy it, don’t worry about others. 
One suggestion, and I’ve looked where I’m staying for work with no luck... find someone that runs when you do that runs about the same speed. A running partner would have been a big help to me. 

Don’t build distance too fast. Especially if you’re overweight. I believe that’s what you stated in your post, but it appears that the moderators deleted it. I made the mistake of feeling like Superman a couple of times and increased my distance far more than the 10% a week that is suggested. I injured my right knee and when it healed, I didn’t learn my lesson. I felt good one week and increased each run by 50% or more to make up for the lost distance. 
My left knee is almost back to 100% and I’m sticking with the 10% guideline and hope to stay healthy. 

I should also add that I’m 50. I also lost almost 35kg from May to late October. I lost about 20 of those before I picked up running to burn the excess energy that I had. 

Also... don’t let your stamina get you down to begin with. It took me a couple weeks to get to where I could “run” the initial 5K distance I was going. Some days I didn’t have it in me to go 2k. I just quit and waited until the next day. 

Pay attention to what you eat and how it affects your time and distance. Write it down. Look for a pattern. 

But most importantly, just go out and run and enjoy it."

running,fck1xtv,t1_fck0v4i,1577714111.0,"People won't judge you for your running, but they will for your spelling and grammar...

Seriously though... I understand your hesitation. When I started in August I would go to a local path around a ball field around 5am and run before work. Nobody around, but after a month or so I got bored and tried a rails to trails. I was mortified the first time I met someone on a bicycle headed my way, but he just said ""morning"" and for the month that I ran that route we became regulars to each other, nothing more than saying ""morning"" or ""have a good day"" when we circled back and met again. 

After another month, I built up the courage to start running the city streets of an evening. I've met a couple other runners over the past couple months and just do the head nod. No look of disgust in their eye at my slowness or bad form. I'm sure if I met any of them going the same way they might give me pointers on my form.

The only negativity I've encountered are the occasional redneck that drives by and shouts something unintelligible. I ignore and continue on knowing that I'm doing something to better myself."
