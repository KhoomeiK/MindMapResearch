1. Poverty statistics for the USA are real. Look them up and dont rely on anecdotes you read on the internet.

2. Fast food and junk food are not a luxury. It is cheap, nutritionally devoid and convenient for people having to work multiple jobs to pay the bills. Maybe you see the obesity epidemic in the USA and assume people are fat because they have so much to eat. There is also horrible nutrition education, and trump just rolled back Michelle Obama's healthy school lunch initiative which will make things even worse.

3. What is this '1k to spend on yourself however you wish'?  Ive never heard of this, if you're referring to welfare you are sorely off the mark of amount of money granted to people experiencing hardships. You must be regurgitating something you heard from right wing conservative groups. 

There are actual people, children, adults, homeless, uneducated, disabled, veteran, born into bad circumstances etc who live in REAL ACTUAL poverty and who have never been out of the country.  They didnt save for three years to go to japan like you.  What a luxury to travel the world, so you must not REALLY be impoverished! /s

Do not accuse others of being privileged when you do not have any idea what it is to live other people's lives. I'm not sure who you know who has saved up to go on a vacation once a year but it sure as hell isn't anyone I've interacted with below the poverty line.

I used to have great posture (from bellydancing and being generally obsessed with carrying myself well) and got complimented on it all the time. Over the years of working desk jobs and not dancing anymore I got worse, until one day I pulled my neck and had to have chiropractic therapy. It was explained to me that my head being forward put excess strain on my neck and to work on having my head above my shoulders, and in practicing I realized just how bad I had neglected my entire posture. Anyway I've started getting compliments on it again. 

Standing tall conveys so much about your confidence, and is just objectively attractive. It makes you appear fit, strong, and energetic. Lifting your chest and pulling your diaphragm in gives you a more hourglass look."
