AskReddit,ff9oxu4,t1_ff99e1u,1579717620.0,"This is ignoring that the Japanese Imperial council was already capitulating and discussing surrender, with the demands they remain contiguous and the Emperor remain in power. Japanese culture at the time couldn't allow the downfall of the Emperor, he was just to important to the every day person. Japan knew with the war in Europe over, their old enemy the Russians would now be on their shores, which they feared because they knew Russia would invade, take over and rape, pillage and destroy their entire civilization. They wanted to surrender. Just not ""unconditionally"". Then the bombs dropped, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed and they surrendered ""unconditionally"". The US, knowing Japan would now be a good strategic Ally ""allowed"" them to keep the Emperor, and to keep the Islands contiguous. The bombs had to be used, it was a major part of US policy at the time. Our Senate knew of it's existence, rumors were spreading in the public of it's existence, and if word got out that the US had a super weapon it feared to use it would be bad for policy. Finally, and most disturbingly there was a desire to know the short and long term effects of using an atomic bomb on a civilian population center. It was a live test, not a tactical final solution to bring Japan to surrender."

We constantly waited for the army of the dead. Ffs that was why we were watching! Yeah the intrigue was great, good fulfilling characters were great. Nobody had a fulfilling ending. The long night was just that, *a* long night and the white walkers, it turns out aren't that hard to kill. They went from an unbelievable existential threat to just another foe. And it happened so fucking fast. Mass Effect 3 was a killer capstone because it was all about defeating the reapers, multiple battles and constant attrition. Mass Effect closed out major plot lines, like the Krogans and the Quarians and Geth plot lines very succinctly, while we got no real reasoning for the white walkers accept quite simply ""they hate us"".
