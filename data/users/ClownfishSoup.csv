Honestly, your best response is that if you ask a girl out, or tell her how you feel and she rejects your intentions. Then you really really need to stop wasting time on her and focus elsewhere. For one thing, you are wasting your time if she's not interested. Time and energy you can use for something else, or for looking for someone else who might be interested. Secondly, if maybe she DID like you and was playing coy? Well, YOU don't have time for that either. If she had some feelings, then move on anyway, if they were genuine then maybe she'll realize that in fact she did want your attention. If you continue to ""try"" with her, then you are being creepy. Best for both of you is you move one. If she doesn't want your attention, then don't give it to her. If she only SAID she doesn't want you attention, well she can deal with it.

Whatcouldgowrong,fgu9n9x,t1_fgtwdk7,1581115590.0,"Partly was his holster. The Blackhawk Serpa hoslter is a retention holster that has a switch you press with your index finger to release the gun. It is dangerously close to where the trigger might be so as you draw the gun your finger is now over the trigger and making an inward motion. As I recall (this video is years old) he was using that holster earlier in the day with a different gun. Then he swapped guns and holster. And when he went to draw this gun, he had already trained his brain to hit the switch on the serpa holster (which he wasn't using). But couple this with some brain fart, it ended up with his finger firing the gun into his leg. I'm not fully blaming the holster and not saying he wasn't at fault, but the combination of the two is why some handgun training places do not allow that particular holster to be used. In theory it's great, but it leaves a subconcious bad habit and requires a slightly dangerous muscle memory (pressing inwards with your trigger finger) Other non retention holsters, or once with a thumb release do not require you to do anything other than keep your trigger finger safely straight and away from the gun.  


EDIT: I may have misremembered. It's possible that rather than the Serpa holster, he was earlier using a holster with a thumb activated ""thumb break"", which required shoving your thumb downwards. Apparently he did this and disengaged the safety on his 1911.  


As someone else pointed out, this only happened because he did, physically, pull the trigger with his finger so ... yeah, his fault, not the holsters, but the holster played a part in making it easier for him to shoot himself."

What helps us is that every two weeks or so, we have a housecleaner come and she cleans the house. Like we'll pre-tidy up a bit, but she cleans it (like cleans the bathroom, mops the floors etc). We know that she doesn't care where things go, so if you have something you don't want lost forever, you have to put it where it belongs...which is another point. Often clutter comes from things with no home.  


I think you have to compromise a bit, as does your family. Maybe as a start, designate one room that must always be clean.

AskReddit,fgtbvcn,t1_fgstzoa,1581102255.0,"I both agree and disagree on this. Some models fit a certain look. But I think there are some models who are somehow just attractive and hold themselves in a way that uh, is attractive.  


I'm showing my age here, but Christie Brinkley, Elle McPherson, Cindy Crawford...old school super models just looked ... attractive, but not in quirky ways. I wouldn't say they appeal to EVERYONE, but they are ""normally attractive"", not ""attractive because they look like Justin Beiber"" or whatever."
AskReddit,fgtb19q,t1_fgswx9s,1581101998.0,"I didn't want to say overeating rice causes diabetes, because I don't know that's true. But his doctor said to him to stop eating rice as it's making things worse, and he didn't, and now he has diabetes. So take that how you will. I don't know what causes diabetes, but apparently when you're on the edge, not changing your diet as your doctor recommends is not not causing it. If you get what I'm saying."

AskReddit,fgtajti,t1_fgsz6g8,1581101713.0,"People don't put a high importance to good (meaning nutritional) food though, that's the problem. Go home and cook, or stop by McDonalds and spend a few bucks. For some folks, they go the easy way. This is in part why there is a lot of ""fat shaming"" in our society. We see obese people as lazy for not cooking nutritional food, and maybe part of that is true.

I mean, when I was single, I'd have no problem ordering a pizza for delivery for dinner. There goes $25. Then I figured, hmm, I can spend $8 on a frozen pizza instead. Then I figured out ... hmm, I can make pizza dough, pizza sauce and add my own toppings for even less, plus I control the ingredients. But it took me time to get there."

CompetitionShooting,fgt12po,t3_f07kt5,1581096830.0,"For my first match I had a regular nylon belt, a generic nylon holster and three double nylon mag pouches with flaps! Not optimal at all! I had to tuck the flaps backwards to keep them out of the way and eventually just cut them off. Nylon holster was not good for speed, but I had it and it worked. I wasn’t trying to win though, just focused on the safety rules and walked each stage instead of running and just tried for accuracy over speed. I actually didn’t come in last somehow, mostly due to people hitting too many no-shoots and missing list mire points than me walking/ jogging to shooting positions and then aiming. I also learned not to rack the slide after every reload."
