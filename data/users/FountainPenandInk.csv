BlackPeopleTwitter,ffv7szq,t1_ffv6k6p,1580257733.0,"The issue is whether the medical issue actually affects mortality, or if there is just a fluke in the data that makes it look like there’s a correlation when there really isn’t. For example, most studies have proven high blood cholesterol by itself doesn’t decrease life expectancy. 

And that statins actually cause more harm in people who just have high cholesterol without other complications, such as diabetes or heart disease. 

But insurance companies still use blood cholesterol to assess risk because the actuarial science tells them there’s a correlation. The reason for the correlation is a lot people who have high cholesterol have other complications, such as obesity, etc. But most insurance companies don’t look at everything, just the cholesterol number. So, someone who is in peak health, but has elevated blood cholesterol will be denied insurance despite not being at increased risk of death. And this doesn’t even begin to consider that most cholesterol tests are flawed and particle size tests are more accurate."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffv6pvo,t1_ffurekk,1580256988.0,"I’m going to call bullshit. Most attorneys say cases aren’t about winning and losing, but about getting the best outcome for the client based on the circumstances. For example, if a client is sued for $10 million, but the jury only finds the payout should be $25,000 because the defense attorney did a good job proving the damages were $25,000 instead of $10 million, that’s still a “loss” in that jury ruled against the client, but the client had a good outcome.

Or, other attorneys will advise a client that they have a good case, but the judge is a wildcard and taking it to trial is risky. If the client takes it to trial anyway, the lawyer may lose even though they told the client not to take it to trial and did a good job defending the client, just because the judge woke up on the wrong side of the bed and didn’t apply the law the way the defense attorney thought the law should be applied."

My point is if you’re in the US and you’re one of the 50% who doesn’t have a flu shot, stop freaking out about a hypothetical event and go get one to address a risk that actually exists today in the US: the flu. Even if you’re not at risk, you’re putting others at risk by remaining unvaccinated.

If you already have a flu shot, carry on.

Edit: 

Also, what you’re saying about the reason this is more deadly because it’s new is wrong. There is not a reverse correlation between age of the virus and deadliness in an unvaccinated person. For example, measles has been around forever and is extremely deadly in an unvaccinated person. Coronavirus is only slightly more deadly than the flu in an unvaccinated person. And most strains of the flu are also fairly new, which is why you have to get a shot every year."
