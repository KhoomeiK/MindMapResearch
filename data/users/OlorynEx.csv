First time playing pvp online, I launch two shotgun blasts to the back of some dude's head, he turns around and one-punch kills me...I can steal hear the broken bits of shot faintly telling me to git gud as they drifted into the air off of his helmet, leaving me a bloody mess on the ground asking, ""...but HOW?!"""

I doodle here and there to improve my skillset, and would like to start a web comic or something if I find time, but in the meantime I draw up small comics for things I enjoy.

AnotherEdenGlobal,fg1chl1,t3_ewbkbk,1580424682.0,"What actually had me look at weapon art versus character art was with Cerrine, who uses a fist weapon, technically, but her in game art has her wielding the same whip as her character art, regardless of what fiat weapon is equipped.

aww,fg0w9pq,t1_fg0v09y,1580416266.0,"Absolutely. Many of us are more grey than we may care to admit, and I dont think there's anything inherently wrong with that. Hell, to be honest, I think it's healthy. And unhealthy. But also healthy, and such is the human experience."
aww,fg0oek6,t1_fg0n831,1580411877.0,"I can totally see your point, about the potential for the oversaturating of kindnesses to the point where they may feel they come from misplaced motivations, but to balance it (without dismissing your point)...well, quite frankly I enjoy seeing these kind of stories, they make me happy and inspired, and since happiness and inspiration aren't as quantifiable or monetizable, in the traditional sense, I think there's room for outlets to share the love. 

I can get value in doing a good deed unnoticed, and I can get value in knowing that sharing that good deed may inspire others or better their day. And I suppose whether that motivation to do so is either pure or selfish, at that point it really only affects how I live with myself, as those who want to follow, may, and those who don't, don't have to.

All that said, I think a great takeaway from your point is the caution that if you ARE going to do a good deed, we would all hope that it's for pure reasons...though I guess some might argue that if a good deed was done, does it really matter the motivation? I'm only half serious, as that's a hell of an age old philosophical question, ha!"

HumansBeingBros,ffcn542,t1_ffcl420,1579802991.0,"Whew, you definitely need to vent, so hey, happy I could be your outlet, and I'm not even trolling. I feel like you're missing (or looking past) my point about context, and I how I imply, contextually, that I don't care about reddit grammar either, unless the poster is so obviously off base. My mistake was engaging at all. It's petty and I know it, but I'm human. Petty enough that you feel like unleashing on me? That's on you, but like I said, you have some negative energy in that post (""fucking retarded"" as example), and maybe you came to this subreddit for happiness and saw a thing that tipped you off, as politics on the internet can do to us all. That said, I wrote that I'm happy to engage in all political sides of debate, and you mention I have blind spots, whereas there were no political engagements that you could have pulled that from. What blind spot? I never mentioned where I stand. In any case, and I mean this genuinely, and not in an ironic way (like most people arguing or debating on the internet seem to mean), I hope you're having a better day and can find some stuff out there that makes you happy. Politics, even for those with the best of intentions, can lead to some toxic shit, and none of us have time for that. If you ever WOULD like engaging in debate or conversation, I happily oblige any who are looking."
HumansBeingBros,ffckem8,t1_ffchxmq,1579801333.0,"I don't expect proper grammar and spelling from anyone. Hell, I'm no master, but if you casually claim to be a young millionaire who makes your money because you are smart (like Chad, here), then it puts up red flags when even the simplest of errors is made (you're/your). If the money was given to you, sure. If you scammed it, stole it or swindled it, sure maybe. If you're trolling and making shit up, absolutely fits. But used your smarts? Major lack of credibility. The easier thing to do would be to make a political claim and leave out the part where you're a millionaire. Point can stick better, credibility still in tact. I'm open to political debate from anyone, especially people with opposing views. I'm happy to research all sides and look at things I value from another point of view. It's healthy. Meaning...I'm not an ""idiot."""

HumansBeingBros,ffch9sl,t1_ffcg9ay,1579799432.0,"Nobody has to, but if you're claiming intelligence as a key point in being a millionaire, one would think you'd use it while making outlandish claims, even if true. If you ARE a millionaire, then cool, more power to ya, but if you're going to casually throw out a flex that you are, citing your smarts as how you got there, then just about everyone would make the assumption that you'd showcase those smarts. Every person of intellect that I've ever known, who uses that intellect as a means for their success, has shown consistency in how they use it. Meaning, they don't use ""your"" in place of ""you're,"" as an example. 

My long-winded way of saying that you're either trolling, or if you're telling the truth, you aren't consistent with your own talk, and sound like you're making it up. These are key points in how NOT to make 7 figures down the road, as constructive criticism."
HumansBeingBros,ffcfck7,t1_ffcdztc,1579798250.0,Spelling and grammatical errors that are commonplace among early elementary school students. Claims to use said intelligence to easily make 7 figures in a reddit post. Seems legit.

gaming,feky182,t1_fekpnk6,1579209959.0,"I'm the same age as you, and feel in the same boat, having had my gaming trends evolve to point where it's very hard to make time for it. Might seem like an odd toss out, especially if you were primarily PC as it sounds, but about a year ago I picked up the Switch, and with it's great first party games, slew of wonderful indie games, large RPGs (Divinity 2 plays amazingly, considering) and such, it's been a fantastic machine to get me through some of those small slumps. A little bit before bed, a little on work breaks (when time permits), hell I even play on our elliptical while pushing some cardio (I've got pretty great with balance), but in any case, I pick up the Switch and game for a little while here and there. It's not the same as shouting strategies with your mates over a headset, or basking in the HD beauty of the next big RPG of course, but it's been a fantastic supplement to when I CAN find time to sit in front of a larger screen.

AnotherEdenGlobal,fecrr6y,t3_eoceiq,1578982132.0,"Minor gripe, and might seem like the petty, low hanging fruit, but I wouldn't complain if the xp grind were scaled a little more favorably, specifically in a way to reflect the difficulty. I can run cake-walk early game dungeons that give more XP than the increasingly difficult late game scenarios, which feels odd, both of which still aren't that great. Just because I caaaaan grind a map to level for hours doesn't mean it feels great to do so. XP badges help ease the pain a little, at least."

I mean, she looks amazing and did a fantastic job on the cosplay, so nothing against her, fan service can be fine and all, and no judgment to those who dig it, but as I get older and make relationships with real women, several of whom are very open about their sexuality, it's just not realistic to depict them this way so often. I know, it's a fantasy video game, and I'm not going to soapbox over any who find escapism in it or ask it be removed, but I'm with ya in sharing a voice that it can often be a little groan inducing, to me."

AnotherEdenGlobal,fdi8gx6,t3_elhmbe,1578437618.0,"I can't recommend this game enough, for several reasons, but the highlight being that compared to any other free mobile game on the market that I've experienced, this one doesn't insult you for not dumping money into it. There is no energy system and no timed/limited events. The most you have are keys to run extra instances of the harder dungeons for mats and such, but the keys regenerate quickly enough, and there's soooo muuuuch to do, that in the downtime between dungeons, you're never bored. That's a tough one to let sink in until you actually play it and think, ""wait...I can just...play?...everything?...and when they add more they don't take anything out?...for free?"" It's fantastic. 

Also, there are no ads, and even the premium currency, of which you get a TON of for free by simply playing, is tucked away in a submenu, without the typical login clutter that flashes in your face, claiming that you can't miss this deal to drop $50 for a chance at the new, mandatory character to stay competitive. Because there IS no competition, except with yourself and your strategies. The core game story all the way until the endgame and beyond is MASSIVE, with tons of quests and challenges to overcome. Like many RPGs, the combat might seem simple-ish in the early chapters, but when facing off against major bosses (and extreme endgame bosses), it's all about tactics and strategically rewarding gameplay. Great graphics, fantastic soundtrack, fun stories and characters, I could gush forever, and have probably overdone it a bit, ha! ...but like I said at the start, I can't recommend this game enough."
Sekiro,fdi5p57,t1_fdi543x,1578436192.0,"Can't argue there, definitely two (hopefully amazing) games to look forward to. I'd say keep a lookout for sales, I've seen Bloodborne as low as $8 used (and hell, it was free on PS+ for a month), so you'll be able to snag it eventually!"

FinalFantasy,fdh0fum,t3_el8rnj,1578412662.0,"Have fun, it's a great series! What makes it great is that there's something for everyone. Not everything lands with every gamer (FFXII seemed unpopular with many fans, at the time, but remains one of my absolute favorites as far as story, world building and characters), so browse around until you find one that seems right, and hell, maybe they'll ALL seem right. The first couple definitely feel dated and a little rough at times, so if you find them to be a little grindy, don't let that be indicative of the polish of the later games. The grind tapers off for the most part during FFIV, I'd say, with the exception of XI and XIV, which are MMO's, and if MMO's are at all your genre, XIV has some FANTASTIC writing as the game pushes on, it's a rather excellent game, reflecting the best parts of the series. 

In all, a ton of great content and memories in these games. My favorite is VI (the story, the world, the SOUNDTRACK), followed by a tie between VII and XII, and here's hoping you find your favorite!"
