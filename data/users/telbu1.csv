unpopularopinion,fepmvr4,t3_eq72vz,1579324748.0,"Unfortunately, there will probably be a *lot* more Chinese tourists in the future. I hear a lot of Chinese people get passports nowadays. 

But to be honest, I don’t support the tourism industry we have today anyway. There’s a lot of places in the world today where tourists outnumber the locals. I would support the tourism industry if local places favoured the local population first, but most places seem to want overtourism there so that they can make money. Unfortunately, that makes it so that the local culture that the tourists came to see pretty much dies out, and a tourism culture is born in its place. AirBnB also contributes to making homes much more expensive when people rent them out to tourists instead of locals to live in. I know a lot of places depend on the tourist money in order to thrive, but it’s a shame because it means that that place can no longer survive on its natural and local resources it always used to survive on. In place of that a tourism culture is born. Cruise ships also contribute to pollution and when they arrive to cities in masses they unload people in the new city in the thousands. Most of the people on the ship don’t contribute to the local economy in any way because they mostly use their money abord the cruise ship. And so locals start getting grumpy because of all the annoying and rude tourists and then the tourists start complaining about rude locals. It’s a vicious cycle. Some good examples of overtourism is Prague, Venice, Iceland, Paris, Lofoten, etc."

TrueOffMyChest,feo5yko,t1_fenbhmd,1579295523.0,"Yeah, similar can be said for country roads. Country roads are for everyone, at least in the country I live in. Not just for cars. I can understand OP about it in cities, but getting angry on country roads without sidewalks is based on the assumption that cars have first right to be on the roads. For millennia, roads have been for pedestrians and horses, why should cars, a two ton murder machine as you said, get better privileges? I think a lot of pedestrians probably feel restricted to where they can move and walk because of cars and asphalt roads, and that they too assume that cars have first right. I live in a city, and seeing roads without sidewalks is rare here. However, there’s a road by my house (not a motorway mind you) that has no sidewalks. I absolutely hate it. If the road is a country road, and that road is the only road available, then everyone should look out for the other— because no one has first right to the road (but a lot of people assume that the car does).

I live in Norway, and lots of foreigners romanticize it. Life here is not perfect; in fact, it can get depressing, especially in winter. Our nature is beautiful though, but that’s not really a valid reason to stay here, especially for people back then. We didn’t have the healthcare system we have now back then either.

Håkon Håkonson who reigned from 1217 to 1262 was also pretty good. He might have resorted to medieval methods as he reigned in the middle ages, but he put an end to the Norwegian civil war era, and he put Norway into a golden age. He stretched Norway’s influence throughout Europe, and the arts, architecture and the military here flourished during his time.

depression,fconavv,t3_eiam2g,1577836523.0,"Just another year of high school, and just another year spent by myself without friends. I hope things change soon. I don’t think I can hold on life much longer; it’s getting too heavy to Bear. I know a numerical change in years won’t change my problems, but I want to do things for myself now. I hope I can get proud of myself soon."

CasualConversation,fclp0qv,t3_ehsit5,1577752985.0,"That’s pretty calming to me actually, that our problems don’t matter in the big sense. But they matter to us, and we’re here to deal with our problems. I live in a country with a small population, and it’s beautiful and peaceful here, and I hope I have a peaceful life where I can achieve what I want: to live a quiet life in the countryside one day. That’s what matters to me, even though it won’t matter once I’m dead, or that it doesn’t matter in universal sense, or that it doesn’t matter to the other seven billion people in this world."
CasualConversation,fclogwm,t3_ehtkc2,1577752610.0,"Just felt like a continuation of 2017 and 2018. Nothing different other than that I’m more grown up, and this year I became legally an adult. I still got no friends, just like 2017 and ‘18. Last time I hung out with my past friends was in ‘17. I mostly stayed inside and play video games or do my very enjoyable hobbies, just like 2017 and ‘18. I don’t imagine 2020 will be much different, though I have no idea in Hell what I’m gonna do once high school finishes. I want to read a lot more books in the coming new year (and more years ahead) though! Mostly because I want to write a book myself, but I don’t have that much experience with reading books."
lonely,fclhw9m,t3_ehntzc,1577748176.0,"I wanna move somewhere else to get a new start at everything. I might make friends, or it might take time to make friends; I might even get no friends at all. All I know is, is that I need a change of scenery. Too many bad memories from where I live now, and too many people I don’t like, and whom don’t like me as well. I want to die, but at the same time I want to live."

SuicideWatch,fci2ijq,t3_eh5tnr,1577656968.0,"I hope I die on 30 April 2020. I’ve had this date in my mind for two and a half years now. It’s getting closer and closer, time is going faster. It’s a little bit scary but it feels like I have something to live for by that date. I don’t know how I’ll feel if I am still alive on the first day of May 2020. I hope I’m dead by then, but only I can make it so."

TrueOffMyChest,fc9vvo8,t1_fc96dyv,1577558969.0,"Maybe we should finally agree on a definiton of introvert if everyone is so confused about what it is. Someone says being an introvert is being reserved and and likes to keep to themselves (no, i’m not talking about social anxiety or shyness), while someone else says it’s only about recharging your social batteries but you can still be outgoing and social (I disagree on this definition. You’re an ambivert in my eyes). In almost every thread that comes up about introversion this discussion comes up. As far as I’m aware, there is no official definiton, just an accepted definition by redditors of ""battery recharge"", though dictionaries often define it as being reversed and enjoying and prefering spending time alone. I myself agree with the latter definition."

Ethnicity isn’t just about skin colour either; in Kingdom Come: Deliverance there are mostly Czech characters, but also Germans, Hungarians and Cumans. They’re the same skin colour, but different ethnicities. Though, cumans were nomads of Turkic origin that settled in the Kingdom of Hungary."
unpopularopinion,fc9gf7b,t3_egn57j,1577552305.0,"I don’t think eastern European video game developers gives two fucks about skin colour diversity. This is mostly an American and west European mindset, and we impose that mindset on them."
