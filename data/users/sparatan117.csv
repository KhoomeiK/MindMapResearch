Take his reply for example, he basically goes full out sexual in either hoping for a shock factor or just yelling into the void for the thrill of it. You can clearly tell that he was doing this for fun but then knew that it would bite him in the ass, as you can see from his reply when he attempted to recover (poorly).

Who's to say that OP would have ever responded otherwise? Just as ... someone else who replied to me mentioned, girls get so many messages that they rarely reply to all of them much less read all of them. I'll bet it legitimately shocked him when she actually did reply... but by then it was already too late. 

Maybe he'll learn a lesson from this... maybe he'll just give up on online dating all together. The whole system is more or less rigged more than people know. I think someone on here on /r/dataisbeautiful did the math from his tinder history and it took him like... over 500,000 swipes to go on 16 dates and of those 8 were meaningful. Girls generally tend to interact based on appearance, which we've found historically to be one of the worst metrics at creating meaningful relationships.... but yet this is where we are.

The Delta Ring.... sigh [Here](https://imgur.com/Y94ubqo.jpg) and it is pretty much exclusive to the AR-15 style platform.

I'm trying to be civil about this but I feel personally attacked. 

The AK's [Gas Blowback system](http://www.diagramoffice.co/images/Infographics/AK-47.gif) shares only similiarities to the M4 in the fact that the gas drives the bolt carrier backwards. However, the gas actually enters the chamber on the M4, whereas it does not in the AK. [Direct impingement](https://imgur.com/S4xkSeb) I was referring to would be more in line with Destiny as most of the modern rifles are switching to this system because less unburnt powder gets to the chamber and dirties up the chamber.
