I've had this shit happen to me numerous times by Bank of America. I deposited $5,000 into an account and was told they would put a ten business day hold on it.

After 10 business days I started writing checks for my move to a new city: rent, utilities, new furniture, etc. 10 days AFTER those checks I started getting calls about insufficient funds in my account. I call the bank and they tell me they had to hold the funds an additional 10 business days, and I would be responsible for all the fees incurred during those checks. When I told them that didn't work for me and that I wanted my money FUCKING RIGHT NOW, the person told me they accidentally out a hold on my funds for another 10 days, AND THEN FUCKING HUNG UP ON ME.

I tried calling back multiple times but no one was willing to help. Before even covering the cost of my actual checks, I had incurred $3,000 in bank fees, charges, etc.

I fucking HATE Bank of America. When their reps showed up to my office 20 years later trying to get our business, I told them to get the fuck out, but not before telling them to look me up in their system."

politics,femte23,t1_femaops,1579269069.0,"Yeah, even he is trending more liberal, but he's an outlier on a few measures because he literally protects the Constitution at all costs, and argues that any changes we want to see need to be handled through legislation. While I certainly don't like many of his judgments, from a Constitutional perspective his defense of its interpretations in pretty respectable.

Here's an example: check out Lawrence vs. Texas. He defended homosexeual sodomy as it was a private act that shouldn't be regulated, and that it was ""uncommonly silly"" that there existed a Texas statute moderating sexual behavior. He even went so far as to state if he were a member of the legislature he would change it himself.

His defense of the Consitution borders on absurdist, almost asperger-like obsession, but I think the real issue with him is he's a perfect example of how racist, homophobic, and controlling our forefathers truly were."

That they are people is without question--or it used to be until people tried to turn this into an issue of inclusiveness. Your argument essentially insists that we never refer to a person's race, ethnicity, or any other describable feature unless it explicitly notes they are people--that's fucking weird, man. Weird and woefully unnecessary.

When you talk about ""gamers,"" do you refer to them as ""people who play games?"" Are all ""football players,"" ""people who play football?"" ""Teachers?"" ""Drivers?"" ""Blondes?"" None of these words DEFINE people, but they do a damn good job describing them, and never when using them are you left wondering ""is this a person we're talking about? Or a dog? Or a caveman? Or a boat? Or a log?"" It's pretty damn clear they're people.

You drink energy drinks? If yes, drop that shit right now. It's all garbage. Take it from a guy who drank them for two decades. Even with drinking coffee still, dropping energy drinks lowered my heart rate by nearly 7 bpm.

Heavy drinker? The ""recommended max"" for men is two drinks a night, but it's bullshit because even two drinks a night is going to raise blood pressure and resting heart rate both due to its immediate intrinsic physiological effects on the body, as well as its effect on sleep efficiency each night.
