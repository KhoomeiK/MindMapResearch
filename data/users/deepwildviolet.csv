Fun anecdote: was thin teen, family went to a steakhouse once a week with another family every single week. I got a salad and some fish instead of steak once or twice over the course of YEARS and was asked repeatedly if I was ""a vegetarian or something"" every dinner out after that. Thankfully my own family is more health-conscious, but I'm also the only non-obese member of my family currently.

femalefashionadvice,fenmpyc,t3_epzxcz,1579287985.0,"My oldest piece of clothing is a long black/dark floral skirt I inherited from my grandmother when she died. Some kind of poly blend, very sturdy and kind of silky fabric, machine washable and doesnt seem to pill, though I do try to avoid machine drying it. It's American made, I'm guessing around 60s-70s based on style, fabric, etc., and the fact that my grandma didnt really buy clothes as she got older, so I'd put it at 50 to 60 years old. She wore it a few times a month in colder months, and I do the same, so 20+ times per year. It's not the only clothing I have from her, but I wear it the most. 

My oldest clothing that's only been owned by me is either a black hooded cardigan from Kohl's about 14 or 15 years ago, or some black Rocketdog shoes with a very short wedge from around the same time. The cardigan has a small hole that could be mended, its a cotton knit cardigan. The shoes are hanging in there for now. I did put inserts in them at one point more for odor reduction than anything else, but I think it might have also helped them last longer. If theyve gotten dirty I just kind of brush off the dirt with a cloth. The outside is some kind of stiff cloth, like a thin soft canvas. 

Ive worn both pieces on and off at least 20 times a year each for the last 15 years."

My experience is that most doctors who are not arrogant will order at least an ultrasound before telling the person they just need to lose weight. To be fair, as a patient, its a lot easier to physically see if there is a problem if you are not overweight. My advice to people is to ask for an ultrasound or labs or something with situations like that, its okay even to say you just want it for peace of mind."

loseit,feckee8,t3_eocemh,1578976060.0,"I was the nurse case manager of a woman in hospice who was on our service for nonalcoholic cirrhosis caused by fatty liver. She was also an RN, and only 60 years old. Educated. Kind. When I asked if anyone had ever told her about those lifestyle risks, she said he doctor always told her she was doing just fine...until she wasn't. She worked oncology or some other specialty where she wouldn't have necessarily kept up with current liver health/wellness literature. Regardless, either her doctor wasn't being 100% honest with her or she wasn't being honest with herself. The lesson here is as OP said: get checked, educate yourself, and make the necessary changes. You don't want to have to tell your family you are going on hospice at age 60 due to something you could have prevented. If you have lab results that are too high or low and are being told they are ""fine for now,"" please investigate further."

I'm a hospice nurse, and a common misconception about grief is that people go through the ""stages of grief"" in the order often given, and they do it once and are done. Thats not usually true. You may have to go through things a few times before youre mostly past it. You may even think youve accepted whats happened, and years down the road, realize you still have some unresolved grieving. That is completely normal. The fact that you know you are depressed tells me you really really need to have a working relationship with someone you can talk to, like a counselor. Even though it seems like it takes time, it will save you time in the long run, since you'll be better able to function on a daily basis with the tools they give you. 

Studying in college is a hard one. I guess the answer there is just....do it? Dont try to wait until you have the ""perfect way,"" its more important just to get it done, even if imperfectly."

Regardless what doctor prescribes the antibiotic, there are only a few really that are standard for prescribing, so I dont think its likely to make a huge difference unless you have a significant history of bladder/UTI issues. 


Drink 8 oz water with 1/2 tablespoon lemon every hour. At the very least it will help dilute your urine. Avoid caffeine, added sugar, alcohol, and sex until you are very sure the UTI is gone. Change undies at least 1-2x/day and only wear cotton undies. Practice immaculate personal hygiene in that area after restroom use. Good luck!"
OrthodoxChristianity,fcxaw17,t1_fcwz7m6,1578057751.0,"Fun story, I made that little repro icon when I was director of my home parishes vacation church school for a summer.

I did an activity with the kids where we took paper icons of the saints and applied them to wood and then decorated them, so that one was mine. 

Unrelated to why I have the icon, but St Kassiani is especially meaningful to me because I was in a Byzantine women's choir and she was our choir's namesake. My best friend is having a baby and naming her Kassiani as well, so that is special:) And I do love her and her prayers."

OrthodoxChristianity,fcv5ycd,t1_fcv56hm,1577995329.0,"I'm not at all against it for the laity, but some historical reasons for it going out of style have included impropriety among the laity and abusing the kiss. In our situation I think it's more that US culture teaches us to have a bigger ""bubble"" of intimacy that is reserved for close friends and family only, in general. In some other countries like Greece or Mexico, that bubble is a lot smaller, so it doesn't feel so ""intimate"" to give someone you dont know well a hug or kiss on the cheek. You wouldn't have those same concerns/discomfort level/considerations when kissing an icon. 


Regardless, we had a council that was ecumenical regarding the importance and veneration of icons among clergy and laity, and not so afaik regarding the kiss of peace among the laity. I think it's nice when it's done but I am 100% okay with it being done or not done per community preference."

To address your other concern: whether the kiss of peace does or doesn't go out of style in the US in the future, I am not sure how relevant it is. If you look at the history of the practice you can see that while it has remained solidly in the liturgical practice of the clergy, the kiss of peace among the laity has come in and out of practice throughout the centuries for various reasons. 


I personally think the practice is currently having a resurgence in the US due to young adults' interest in returning to a broader experience of life in the Church, possibly slightly in rebellion of the previous generation who oftentimes felt they had to quiet some of the more distinct and ""unAmerican""-looking pious practices."

No long visits due to having to explain difficult medical jargon in relatable terms, no pissing off the patient telling them things they dont want to hear, just reaffirming whatever bad behaviors had the patient coming to you in the first place. Worst case scenario for your public reputation, your patients end up hospitalized at slightly higher rate than normal providers due to the high hospitalization rate for people with chronic diseases anyway. Many doctors just tell people ""ya look great"" instead of pointing out smaller warning signs or issues in vitals or bloodwork, because then you have to explain the problem and give advice, which takes time. Side note: theyre not ""required"" to tell you when stuff is kind of off, thats why I always tell prople to get copies of or ask about their numbers for reference. It's really mostly up to their conscience or fear of litigation when they mention things at all. 


It sounds like she wants to be practicing spa medicine. Everyone leaves ""happy"" and feeling good about themselves.
