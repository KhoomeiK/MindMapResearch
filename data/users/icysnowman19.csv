I also loved how 80s everything was, and at this point I'm just really attached to the characters - the boys, El (in particular), Max, Hopper and Joyce.

What I didn't like was S2E7, that random interlude where it's almost comical and literally has no relevance to the plot and was really out of place."

harrypotter,fciky3f,t1_fcgqqc9,1577664289.0,"Look, some cultures do use physical discipline to teach their children, and Fred clearly learned his lesson and grew up to be an honourable, if a little mischievous, man. Objectively, none of us can deny that Severus Snape is a polarising character. 

Yes, he was mean and nasty, and yes, he played favourites and verbally abused Muggleborns on various occasions and yes, he was objectively a terrible teacher (imo being a teacher requires a certain sense of honour, and of wanting to mentor the student to grow their skill in a subject and as a person as well). But he also risked, and eventually sacrificed, his life for a kid he pretty much hated from day 1, and why wouldn't he? It's one last reminder of how James Potter, golden boy of Gryffindor, had loved, and been loved by, Lily Evans.

That being said, it *is* Snape's own fault for this happening, since he chose the Dark Arts and never actually cared to understand Lily and her dislike towards how dark he was turning. I mean, he thought Mulciber and Avery's dark magic ""prank"" toward a Muggleborn was an idea of a joke. Snape canonically had an abusive relationship with an alcoholic father iirc, and while this factors in towards young Snape's embittered worldview, he could, and should have chosen to grow stronger and become his own man.

After all, if impulsive and stupid (in some ways) Sirius Black could manage to break off from a racist, abusive family and become an honourable, loyal Gryffindor, why couldn't Severus break away from the violent, hatred-driven tendencies of his father before him? I strongly dislike Severus for this reason, but I also sympathise with him for the hardships he endured his whole life.

About your dislike of James, while I understand he was a douche as a teenager, he eventually grew up and shouldered his proper responsibilities in ways that young Snape never quite managed to do. I myself am prone to bouts of mischief and chaos, but like James, I matured and figured out there were more things to life than pranks and jokes. About the SWM scene, James and Sirius definitely went too far, and should have been more heavily disciplined imo, but what the Marauders and Snape had was a rivalry, not a ""Marauder-bullying-Snape"" dynamic as is commonly presented on Reddit.

TL;DR James and Snape both had issues as teenagers, James fixed them and grew into a courageous, honourable young man (there's that Gryffindor sense of chivalry!), while Snape, a tragic, fallen figure never quite managed to break from his bitterness and hatred, but despite his hardships he ultimately gave his life for a greater cause, even if they were for the wrong reasons."
HPfanfiction,fcih4x0,t1_fci0e2s,1577662458.0,"True, I agree with you on pretty much every point, him and Snape are my least favourite characters. That being said, Malfoy arguably does have somewhat of a conscience and a very shaky moral compass, in that when faced with the choice to execute Dumbledore, he just can't do it. Yes, in a way it is cowardly and as a Gryffindor it's one of the things I dislike about him most, but his soul isn't so far gone that he senselessly murders those he perceives as enemies."
