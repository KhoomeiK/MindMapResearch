- Perfecty legal.

- Add fall damage to attack damage.

- Forced Movement doesn't give opportunity attacks. Maybe don't use the flanking rule?

- Perfectly legal.

- See above comment about leg attacks. Moreover, they could make a check to disarm, but that's an action, not an attack.

Like, they knew how to do the problem on a technical level, but they couldn't figure out what it was asking for reasons beyond their control.

That being said - the issue right now is not that the tests are racist, it's that *on average* black people tend to live in the inner city more so than white people, and *on average* inner city schools suck. The reasons for this are complicated but essentially boil down to ""people were really fucking racist in like the 50's-ish and they fucked over black people in ways that persist to this day and are really really hard to undo. Primarily discriminatory housing practices.""

So, it's not so much current racism so much as the difficulties of undoing the impact of the racist practices of previous generations."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff4xg6y,t3_e124a7,1579574776.0,"Thread necromancer here. Sorry.

There's 2 big ones. The first is Yesterday Upon the Stair - it's a 6th sense AU where deku's quirk is seeing ghosts. It's really, really well written. And also finished.

The second is The Dark Below. Now let me get this out of the way first - The Dark Below is edgy as all hell. It opens with Deku dying *and it does not get lighter from there*. HOWEVER, it is one of the most smartly written and thought provoking pieces of fiction I've read in a long time. It blends truly breathtaking descriptions of Lovecraftian cosmic horror with incredible worldbuilding, smart commentary on the nature of power and politics in a world where everyone has powers, and deep philosophical discussions on what it means to be a hero, whether that is a thing worth being, and what it will take to fix the problems with a fundamentally broken world. And despite the incredibly dark themes, it's balanced out by the fuckin ray of sunshine that is Deku in this story. Despite being basically destined to be the cosmic horror to other cosmic horrors, and despite going through so much shit, Deku's defining character trait in this story is pure, unyielding altruism and faith in humanity. And in a world where villain is a term used to dehumanize and dismiss both those who act out of desperation and those whos seek to challenge a fundamentally corrupt system, someone who's willing to listen to those people and help them and is *far* too powerful to stop or silence may just be the thing that brings the whole system crumbling down. Is that a good thing? Is going so far justified? How evil or necessary are the necessary evils on all sides? It's hard to tell, but the author updates weekly on Thursdays and is on chapter 60/75."
