SuicideBereavement,ffbvp19,t3_espig2,1579784334.0,"I've called the hotline a few times myself, most recently just last week. It always made things worse. If I wasn't out on hold for 30+ minutes (sometimes I never even got through, I gave up while on hold for too long), it felt like they were reading scripted answers. Like they were flipping through pages to find something to say. It never felt genuine, and always made me feel like I was talking to a robot. It sucks, and is in major need of reform."

So I take it you do care, and maybe a little too much it seems. It eats at you, doesn't it? Father's day must be sooooo grim for you.

Lots of people have only one or even no parents at all. It's not a big deal. Sounds like you were actually wanted, since your mother went through the whole ordeal and it can't have been easy, so maybe try being grateful?"
AMA,ff9zmqb,t3_esb9oa,1579724900.0,Do you even care about all that or does it just not bother you? I feel like I wouldn't care all that much about being a sperm bank baby.

Like, drinking straws? I don't see how that could set off any alarms. Also, wouldn't that warp the spine of the book? I would think straws were too thick to use as a book mark.

I have so many questions about this bizarre scenario you're in."

im14andthisisdeep,ff5je4t,t3_erkln9,1579595647.0,"Most subways in my experience don't have internet or cell reception, so most people I've seen aren't on their phones. Their reading books and magazines instead. Because nobody wants to fucking be bothered into a verbal frenzy with a stranger on their way to work or home from work. It's not the appropriate situation to try to form long lasting relationships, and nobody likes casual meaningless small talk. Literally the only interactions I ever am okay with having on the subway are like, when someone is asking for directions or needs to know which train is going where."
