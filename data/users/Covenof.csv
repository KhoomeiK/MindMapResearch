At 13 I had serious doubts that I would even live this long.

memes,fdbnzax,t1_fdb2evk,1578259285.0,"Fair point. Not every natural disaster is an end of times omen or even caused by us (through being sinful/stupid/whatever). 

It is pretty well documented that the Smokey Bear campaign contributed to the size and devastation of recent California fires. Instead of letting nature take care of itself we put out small fires that were beneficial to the overall forest to protect ourselves and it ended up just leaving more fuel for fires to grow to enormous proportions and fuck everything up in ways that wouldn't have naturally happened because smaller fires would've cleared out the debris before it built up to that point. For the California wild fires we don't really have anyone to blame other than ourselves. 

That giant earthquake in I believe Chile a few years back? Yeah, humans didn't have anything to do with that. Tectonic plates are beyond our control at this point.

The Australian wild fires? It's pretty agreed upon that it's a combination of nature and mankind. Australia is prone to bush fires. Australia is prone to droughts in some areas. The bush fires themselves aren't that unusual, it's the fact that they are so large, widespread, and even burning down rainforests that it's very unusual and points towards humans being at least partially to blame. 

For me personally I live in a high desert environment. There are usually about 2-3 large wild fires in my area during the summer in the brief time that I've lived here. I don't blame climate change for it because it's completely to be expected/at least unsurprising in this environment. If a giant wild fire happened in the temperate woodland of my homeland though I'd 100% blame mankind because in the 20 years I lived there not a single one ever happened, and I never heard of one happening even before then. The closest to a natural disaster they ever had was some tornadoes a few years back, which was strange due to it being a pretty hilly area in general but it only hit the flatter areas of town so it still made sense without mankind having to be involved.

It's such a normal concept in American culture that people honestly think that all white people should pay reparations to all black people over slavery, even though literally no one who was personally involved on either side is still alive.
