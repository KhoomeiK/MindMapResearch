awfuleverything,ff7diuf,t3_es2697,1579647053.0,"Companies sometimes send itens in bigger boxes because it is easier for transport. Imagine if there were thousands of box sizes, it would be way more difficult to fit the same amount of boxes in a truck, for exemple. So the box size actually makes shipping cheaper, because they can fit more boxes in the truck/whatever. Less travels, more boxes delivered."
