\- Parents need to start taking responsibility for the damage they cause to their kids, instead of just blaming it all on other kids/parents

\- Stop putting almost all the pressure of success entirely on men. We live in a society now where the majority of people need a 2nd income to survive, and it shouldn't be only one sex's responsibility

\- Stop telling men they are worthless if they don't possess an unattainable standard of wealth and genetics, not to mention an unrealistically ideal family upbringing
