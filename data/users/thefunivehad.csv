>Nazi theory indeed specifically denies that such a thing as ""the truth"" exists. ... The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the Leader, or some ruling clique, controls not only the future but the past.

And as I read recently, just see what works for YOU. Don't give a care about what works for others. Their body reacts very differently to food and metabolism and life than yours. Just keep going and you'll see results. Maybe not immediately in weight loss, but in other ways. Give it at least 3 or 4 weeks...if still no change, try a shorter eating window for 3 or 4 weeks.

I decided to lose some weight from the holidays...okay, most of last year...about 15 pounds. In course of my time reading all that I could online (the library is suspect for nutritional books since the science seems to be changing daily).

Without getting into all of the details, I was led to trying IF (Fast 5) and while doing that, also the Keto diet. I'm a vegetarian, so I'm able to do a version of keto that includes lots of nuts, nut butters, oils, and yogurt sources. 

I read a lot on IF AND keto...about calories in/calories out, exercise (which I do), protein requirements/non-requirements, blah, blah, blah. I couldn't find any sites that agreed with other sites. The nutrition industry is all over the map. Keto is a world changer to some, a terrible idea that leads to sepsis for others. IF is a terrible idea to some, and life changer for others. As many arguments there were FOR, there were that many against....all very strong in their opinions. 

I also recently had inguinal hernia surgery. The same damn thing. There was hardly any consensus about procedures, and any statistics available were used as either proof or debunked as cherry picking or unverifiable. 

I know we are to do our OWN research, but jesus christ on a cracker. So, in the case of the surgery, my surgeon (who was endorsed by my GP), had the final say. In the case of IF and keto, I'm just trying it to see what happens myself. I've been doing both for a little over a week and have lost two pounds. My pants fit. ""It's all water weight!!"" I can hear people screaming. Sure. Maybe. Maybe not. Who the fuck knows? 

I'm trying it mainly to find out for myself. What other way is there at this point given all of the conflicting information out there about just about everything?"
unpopularopinion,ffpiicc,t1_ffpc70r,1580095855.0,"The ""spoons"" i get in thai or other asian restaurants are more like boats than spoons. I'd agree with OP that the fork and spoon (both sizes...soup spoons and tea spoons) are vastly superior to sticks. I'm not saying that people who've used chopsticks for most of their lives don't get to be really good at it, but right out of the box, stabbing some egg along with some bacon and a tomato with a fork or scooping some peas with a spoon is easiest. Not to mention being able to use your knife to pile stuff on the backside of a fork or spoon...it's like a little tool kit at the table for all applications or methods of eating your food."
