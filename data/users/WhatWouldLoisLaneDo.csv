WaltDisneyWorld,ff7z8gd,t1_ff7wmgi,1579661903.0,"I'm from SC so I understand the fluctuation.  Last week I was outside in shorts and the past few days it has been in the 40s during the day and 20s at night.

I was just down in early September and the entire week we were there it only rained for about fifteen seconds as we were getting on the bus tour at KSC.  I've never experienced so little rain in central Florida and it was awesome!"
aww,ff1aijn,t1_ff0gq79,1579476859.0,"We had a poodle who was with us for 17 years (toy) and he only liked soft toys but we had to buy ones with closed loop threads or no fur at all.  He would methodically pull every piece of hair out.

My build a bear is actually missing some fur on the back of one leg near his butt where my dog got hold of it when it was fairly new.  I was slightly annoyed at the time but now that my dog is gone it reminds me of him."
WaltDisneyWorld,fezyluq,t3_eqq9kg,1579463327.0,I went last year the week after Labor Day and it was the least crowded trip I've ever had.  Weather was more tolerable with a good breeze (though I am from SC and have a higher tolerance for heat and humidity).  It was awesome!
DisneyPinSwap,fevwl3i,t3_eqptv8,1579402357.0,I ordered my pins right as they went live. I may or may not have been waiting in the drive thru at Starbucks.
TheGoodPlace,fet3o97,t1_femybrr,1579371514.0,My dad and I have often discussed how religion holds little appeal to us because the prospect of eternal paradise kind of seems like a nightmare.
WaltDisneyWorld,fesczqy,t3_eq2jia,1579363983.0,"My post office lost my package with my magic bands and never admitted to it or did a single thing about it except for telling me that ""it will arrive tomorrow"" three times and give me a phone number that no one ever answered.  It was a hot mess.

I called the ShopDisney number and explained my situation.  They told me to give it one more day and call back if it didn't arrive, after which they resent my package overnight at no cost to me (and through UPS rather than USPS.)

Tldr USPS sucks and Disney should fix it if you call."

DuggarsSnark,feib8tz,t1_fehl92l,1579134454.0,My dad was raised as a JW.  Despite their very restrictive access to wordly things he and his cousins (almost everyone is out by now) loved LOTR.  He credits it being too intelligent and little known in our small Southern town to even be on the elders' radar.

Gamecocks,fecbdig,t1_fdve399,1578970092.0,"When I was in band the drumline figured out how to play on the rims of their drums and would do so at away games.  Never during a a play, of course.  It was kind of funny."
WaltDisneyWorld,febnnyx,t3_enyk0o,1578960761.0,"I HATE the new Test Track.  The story went from the beginning of the line until he very end of the ride.

The new one feels rushed and the ride itself feels like a blink and you'll miss it experience."
WaltDisneyWorld,febi93e,t1_fe922uf,1578959112.0,That is ANNOYING.
WaltDisneyWorld,febhtxw,t1_feamgyb,1578958941.0,"I work in a museum and feel your pain.  In some ways I get it but it's very annoying and our old CEO wouldn't budge at all.  Thankfully, new senior leadership is WAY more flexible with the ""No"" rule when it comes to safety, thank goodness.  For example, I have no problem saying ""Please use your walking feet"" but ""Stop climbing"" really needs to be regularly said."
WaltDisneyWorld,febh29s,t1_feaeat1,1578958697.0,We were waiting in line for 7DMT back in September and there was a family in line ahead of us who kept letting their four kids/tweens sit down and play on their phones.  They would get ahead in line and every five minutes thr kids would push past us to catch up.  They weren't exactly rude about it but it was beyond annoying.

WaltDisneyWorld,fdwtd1z,t3_emnc2u,1578762145.0,I had a lower back injury a few years ago.  It healed but I find myself in not great shape on rainy days and if I fall asleep scrunched up and the like.  I'm fine on regular rides and coasters but the back support aspect makes me nervous.  How much pressure (if any) does the back restraint apply?
WaltDisneyWorld,fdwsaig,t3_emr0uc,1578761893.0,Stayed here in my first ever trip in 2004.  I was so surprised at how quickly we went from Florida highway traffic insanity to feeling like you were nowhere.  I love it.

aww,fd669io,t1_fd581ry,1578186110.0,Somewhere on the internet is a video of a dog who's favorite toy is a Gumby so her owners dress up as Tiny to surprise her.  She loses her mind in the best way possible.
WaltDisneyWorld,fcfybw5,t3_eh2smj,1577634788.0,"Years ago I was at WDW with my cousins and their kids who were 5 and 10 at the time.  They had some credit card/travel company thing for exclusive story time with the Fairy Godmother at the theatre on Main Street.

 We ended ended up being the only family in there and after story time she spent FOREVER with the kids.  The five-year-old (girl) was beyond enchanted and Fairy Godmother was so sweet that even 18-year-old college student me couldn't resit a hug!"
WaltDisneyWorld,fc5rtfl,t1_fc3e2yv,1577464470.0,"I turned 30 at ge ebd of August, TLM is also my favorite and turned 30 this year like us.

I went for my 30th but wanted until after Labor Day when kids were back in school and I could more easily step away from my job for a week.  It was just as fun!"
WaltDisneyWorld,fc5kimm,t1_fc4qx7k,1577460058.0,"My first visit in 2004 was one of the last years they offered E Ride nights at MK for a whopping $10.  What a time to be a teen at WDW üòÅ

I also remember evening EMH at HS a few years later and riding ToT 12 times in a row without a wait."
TwoXChromosomes,fc5ishc,t1_fc4re1j,1577458752.0,"Seeing kitchen staff come out of the bathroom with their aprons still on is an automatic end to my meal there.

Yeah, Clempson is better in football right now but we beat them in almost every other sport regularly and we have many national titles in other sports under our belt.  Idiot Too Deep-screaming ""fans"" can't accept that fact and it is pointless arguing with them. 

It is a fun rivalry until dumbasses ruin it."
