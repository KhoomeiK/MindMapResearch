You said that he’s concerned that it will become “his debt.” Have you tried reassuring him that you intend to pay your debt off 100% by yourself without help from him? Since you’re already working full time, it seems you should have no problem paying your own bills. But, although you’re not doing anything wrong, there is a pattern in our society of women feeling entitled to their boyfriends’ money, and that may be what he’s reacting to here. 

(Before you comment calling me a sexist, I’m a woman and a feminist too! Equality means all able-bodied adults should pay their own bills.)"

financialindependence,fffvmce,t3_etdruc,1579892775.0,"It’s about mindful spending, not minimal spending. Honestly, for every time you eat out because it’s truly helpful for networking, there are probably many times you eat out just because it’s easy and fun. How many new clothing purchases are truly necessary to be well-groomed and how many are just for fun? Is the new luxury car really a lot safer than the older basic car, or is that just what the ad men want you to think?

These are the questions we should be asking ourselves."

The only real benefit of telework I see is no commute, but if you live close to work or have an active commute, that’s not a problem."
