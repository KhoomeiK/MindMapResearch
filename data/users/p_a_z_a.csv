Anxiety,ffgluqk,t3_etgvbs,1579909240.0,"My symptoms increased my panicked thoughts and my unfounded worry so I would say yes. I do still have those thoughts but the emotional response isn't as bad. It's actually barely there at all. I sometimes wonder if that's a good thing but it's an improvement so I just go with it for now. 

Good luck."
depression,ffglmsn,t3_etbyd9,1579909091.0,"I think it was 2 years ago I had a similar thing happen. She and I both have mental health issues and were there for each other through some dark shit. I think that was part of the reason it wouldn't work. At any rate, I got way worse after we broke up and didn't think I'd recover. Was very low. Almost the lowest I've ever been. But two years (I think) and much effort later I'm a bit proud to say my life has actually improved well beyond that pit I was in. I really never thought it would happen.

I hope the same for you."
Anxiety,ffgk903,t3_etfwm0,1579908157.0,"Absolutely felt the same. I was scared of most things besides being secured in my bedroom. That was the most relaxed I would get anyway. Couldn't force myself to ask for help for a long time. I did though and it helped a lot. It's work to fight it, can't lie, but it's better. For me just better is so good. I'm to the point that I have no reference for how I used to feel in my emotional memory (if that's even a thing) so I have to trust that I still need medication and therapy. Sometimes it's just going through the motions but I remember when I had to rush from my room just to use the restroom because I was so far gone. 

Maybe if you wrote down what you would say to a doctor and practiced saying it you would feel a little better about it. Just a suggestion. When I finally did it I was still close to passing out but I think that helped me get ready enough to do it. 

In case you aren't aware, there are some breathing exercises that help too. I think anxiety tends to affect our breathing and we don't even realize it so when we stop and take deep breaths it can improve the situation. 

this video helped me quite a bit a few times, in the moment. I rarely was able to think to cue it up at the correct time but it helped a few. I would also bring it up and just breathe along before I was too far into the attack.

Oh and as far as being afraid you'll have your anxiety rejected I bet just about any doctor will treat you according to your report simply because they want the business, but the things they do will help. And some of them genuinely want to help people. 

Good luck."
depression,ffgipgi,t1_ffg79ns,1579907141.0,If the ingredients include diphenhydramine then it can be a cumulative effect. That stuff also harms your brain function. Speaking from experience. I was never the sharpest tack but now I'm noticeably more dull.
depression,ffgicza,t1_ffg9iwa,1579906910.0,"I'm sorry but this was hilarious because it reminded me of my old cat who did the same, seemingly."
depression,ffgi7d2,t1_ffgdbpn,1579906808.0,It's good to have people but it's way better to have felines.
depression,ffghmu0,t1_fffznqg,1579906437.0,"My current therapist said the best thing when I told her I still have no plans beyond 50 years old. She asked what I meant and I said I'd be checking out and she asked if I felt safe in the meantime which the answer was yes and then she said ""well I hope we can change that"" and we moved on."
depression,ffgh8bv,t1_fffr4e5,1579906174.0,"I had an ER nurse ridicule my attempt while I was strapped down to a gurney having the charcoal shake forced down my throat. I understand they have frustration but keep that shit to yourself, eh?  You can bet I thought about that fucker the next time I tried and I for sure didn't call anyone last second that time."
depression,ff49wvq,t1_ff37m8s,1579558731.0,This sounds real familiar. Lately it's been a little better for me but I think I'm skipping work tonight. I have these couple days where I'm full of energy and desire to make an impact followed by a fucking drop off in will to live. Some form of this shit life/shit cycle going on for 30+ years now. Getting real tired.
depression,fdvqaqs,t3_en2qbu,1578750250.0,I'm just going through the motions here. I don't have a ton of emotion. I have such little drive to change my situation beyond the thought of wanting things to be better. It's almost like I'm just having these thoughts to convince myself to take action. Kind of a fake it til you make it approach. It isn't working.
depression,fallsu9,t3_e9kwb9,1576186501.0,"I used to do this all the time. Recently I began to believe that if someone is suffering, that's it. You know that for yourself. It might not be considered depression by mental health professionals but it's not nothing. It would be classified with some sort of diagnosis. Also, it's legitimate if you're feeling it. It's real and needs to be addressed somehow. It's an ordeal and it's fucking terrible."
