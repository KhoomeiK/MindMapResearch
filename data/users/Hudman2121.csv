memes,fdtqrkp,t1_fdtmkrz,1578720740.0,"Please explain how it doesn’t include 0. When you use interval notation like this it usually signals that a function’s domain or range is all real numbers. Hate to break it to you, but 0 is a real number."

memes,fdsg0q2,t1_fdqnbz3,1578701948.0,"This comment is... just so wrong. What she is using right now is called (at least where I learned it) interval notation. Interval notation is written similarly to an ordered pair. All numbers in between the numbers on the left and right are solutions to an equation, function, etc. If you want to include one of the numbers on the side, you would use a bracket instead of parenthesis. If you want to indicate all real numbers, this is how you do it in interval notation. (-infinity, infinity) (Idk how to type infinity so there’s that). The commenter left the ends as parenthesis also indicating -infinity and infinity aren’t solutions but everything else is. What the person did is completely correct. I guess you could argue it doesn’t include imaginary numbers but considering you didn’t pass algebra 1 you most likely don’t know anything about them."
