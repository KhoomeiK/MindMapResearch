When I was 27 I am dating my SO of 24 her parents went all pissy when we started sleeping together.

They reprimand me like they are my own Son for doing that when I ask them nicely  to respect my boundaries they got mad so I just ignored them and went on to date my GF.

But then they started harrassing me thinking that I would be intimidated by their rural ways.

So I threatened to sue them if they wont stop. 

They finally shut up."

Limerence fuels creativity among artists.


You have to wonder how much those artists have suffered..

You have to wonder how much of their talent and artistic output is gained at the expense of their emotional health.

As a limerent artist my self I often think if Limerence is the price I pay for my gift of music."

limerence,fddhz5y,t3_ekr3cw,1578313059.0,"Putting the LO on a pedestal that always happens when we are experiencing that dope rush and since I heve two previous LOs in my life I have learned to not do that so much.

So now on my 3rd Limerent episode I am so in love with a girl a barely know and yes at the beggining of my limerence I put her on a pedestal but as soon as I realized I am limerent again "" I was like oh not this shit again""


I started trying to keep tabs of all the negative stuff my LO does but since I barely know her its difficult to find one we are just online friends after all and barely chat too! 

Soon enough I see lots of red flags traits that I think would not be good for a relationship it got to the point I am seeing some very bad character traits but still these are just my impression.

But even seeing that has not stop my limerence so I just outright disclosed my feelings and so we end up having a long chat.

And you know what I discovered? My LO is such a wonderfull person so openminded and so thoughtfull that she rejected me as gently as possible and called me a Friend.

And we started chatting more because of that and I realized all that negative traits I am seeing is just me imagining stuff and hoping that I stop being attracted to her because I fear rejection.

My LO shared so much of her personal story to me her tragedies her triumphed and did really acknowledged my feelings for by saying ""sorry I know how unrequitted love can be painfull but its just imposible for me to even try"" 

She did not mocked my feelings she appreciated it she said its ""normal you are not creepy dont say that"".


I could not have asked a better outcome short of LO reprocating my feelings."
limerence,fdd4hbb,t1_fdcszhj,1578294413.0,"Because mostlikey some of those Songs were written by limerents as well.

All those romantic songs out there you have to wonder the emotional cost it took to write them.

They could be fictionalized stories of un-requited love turned happy ending by the composer.

Its what I am doing now I am planning on writing a 3 part rock opera about my LE. 

In this story my LO and me ends up together..

I think I have mild MDD.

I tend to day dream and flap my hands like an idiot some times for an hour."
limerence,fdd4bj7,t3_eki72k,1578294216.0,"I am a musician and I am exactly like this.

Some songs I associate strongly with LO.

Even instrumental pieces that gives me some emotional high reminds me of my LO.

And since music is my life its hard for me to avoid.

And when my limerence fades the songs lose their meaning and not as enjoyable to play or listen too as before."
