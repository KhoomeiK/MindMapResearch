Dude, it's not okay for your wife to call you names and demean you. It doesn't matter how frustrated she was about whatever issue, for her to belittle you (especially about something that she probably knows you are sensitive about) is verbal abuse. As you stated in a comment in this thread, you wouldn't do that to her no matter if you were angry or not.

The bigger question here is whether or not this has been a pattern of behavior on her part or not. If this is the first time she has done this to you then sit her down and explain very explicitly how her comments made you feel and how it is not acceptable for her to say such things to you again in the future, ever.

If, on the other hand, this has happened before and is a pattern of verbal abuse from her then you really need to consider the long term viability of this relationship."
