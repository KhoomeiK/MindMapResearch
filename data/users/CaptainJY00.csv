I don’t know where OP is from or how he is but if he’s just going to school like every student, the bully should be doing the same thing instead of being a dick. The bully should be grateful that even as an Illegal Immigrant that his family is able to live, get an education and a job. I’m hundred percent sure that the bully’s parents are grateful. But OPs not only been bullied but ganged up on too. Which is common as shit because the “scummy” Latin Americans know they can’t fight one on ones so the next option obviously is group fight, but oh look he’s alone so guess we’ll jump him instead, that’s their mentality. And is the Bully justified to bully other people because they want a better life?
