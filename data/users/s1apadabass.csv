Portland,fff5cfo,t3_et4yu0,1579876103.0,Sorry that this happened to you. It’s so scary I can’t even imagine. I carried a pocket knife and a pepper spray for that reason. My hand is always in my pocket on the pepper spray ready to spray when I’m out alone at night walking. I used to live downtown Seattle and relied on Public transportation for a year and that was how I felt/stayed safe.

Parenting,fdlqhmp,t1_fdlq9c9,1578530069.0,Ibuprofen doesn’t work the same way. I’m a true ibuprofen gal for everything. Aleve keeps the inflammation down and it’s every 12 hours you take a pill. My doc prescribed me double the dose which I had to be very careful with. The only trick I know. I don’t take aleve for anything else.
Parenting,fdlonqf,t3_elx94f,1578528825.0,I’ve had 2 back injuries on separate occasion. Old wounds don’t heal. The old aches and pains show up here and there. I get muscle relaxers and aleve for a few days and almost back to normal. Speedy recovery!
