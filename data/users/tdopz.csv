I don't disagree with anything you said. I think you just misinterpreted OP's intention. Admittedly, I could be wrong, of course. Maybe you should also consider the possibility that you could be wrong in your interpretation rather than just jumping at the chance to call someone stupid."

Since I currently have none. On a general note, I feel it's very easy to forget that celebs have personal lives and personal issues. They have bad days and struggle with emotional issues just like anyone.

 I've recently rewatched almost all of the OG seasons for the first time in probably a decade, at least, and couldn't resist googling a ""best of"" list and was astounded to find that episode in the 60s or 70s, iirc.
