The most critical part of the plan was to follow up with an immediate coup by utilizing [Operation Valkyrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Valkyrie) to try and wrestle executive command from the Nazi leadership and into the hands of the Wehrmacht. Then ultimately attempt to enter into a negotiated peace with the Allies.

This gentleman has the ""refined"" accent. Which was more common back in the day. 




1. General accent - The majority of the country. Chances are people in the bigger cities sound like this. 


2. Broad accent - The sterotype accent. Ie. Crocodile Dundee. 2nd most common and chances are the more rural you are, the more likely it is you speak like this. But again, plenty of people who have lived their whole lives in the city can sound like this. And plenty of people who live out bush don't sound like a terrible Outback steakhouse commercial. 



3. Refined accent - Now the rarest type. The old style of Australian accent. The Kings/Queens English. This sounds more ""British"" to outsiders. The ""posh"" accent. Now not at all common among younger Australians. Think older Boomers and the last of the Greatest Generation. Watching old documentaries on WW2 and such and most people will sound like this."

You get on top of the dog and press all of your weight onto it. If it's a serious attack like this one, you just gotta do what you gotta do. The advice after pinning the dog is to literally rip/bend/crush/splay their legs out. Especially if the dog is belly up. You try and grab both front legs and just use all of your might and push/rip them down to the ground. Like splitting a chicken in half. 


It's not like you are going to get away scottfree from bites, but letting the attack go on and ripping your legs isn't going to stop further injuries. You gotta try and end it as quickly as possible if you cannot get away or out of reach from the animal quickly. 


You will most likely kill the dog, but seriously. I have seen enough of these videos and the aftermath and this is exactly what I would do if it happened to me. I've been chased and bitten by 2 pitbulls when I was a kid on a bike. Fucking terrifying."
