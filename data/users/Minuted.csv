Is it a quote? I mean, why shouldn't they be compared? You can't actively do any good or avoid and minimise harm unless you make judgements about which outcome is best. I have no doubt there are asses out there who do make needless and tactless comparisons for all the wrong reasons, but why not have the rule be don't make needless or tactless comparisons?

The only way it makes some sense is if you're saying that we shouldn't squable about which past tragedy is worse. That makes more sense, isolated from this context, even if it still has the same issues as how it's being used here. It also leads to some pretty nasty conclusions, for example, are you saying that we shouldn't consider the Holocaust worse than 9/11? I'm sure I could sit here and pick out examples from history, each of them is going to have some sort of death count as well as other metrics to judge it by. And sure, there are gonna be people out there that would try to downplay certain events and up-play others to fit with their agenda. But when it comes down to it we *have* to compare these things, because the alternative is much worse. It might not always be easy or pleasant to have to, but we do have to.

I did just think, when you say infinite magnitude, do you mean tragedy as a personal loss, i.e, you're saying that Mrs Smith losing a husband might not be as bad as Mr White losing his three sons in an accident, but they are both personal tragedies that cause nigh-immeasurable suffering? That makes sense, again, to an extent. I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where it's seen as ok to play the tragedy olympics, with gold going to whoever has the most awful tragedy.  Still don't see that we shouldn't though, even if I can understand what you might be trying to avoid. The benefit of silencing the sort of people who might use tragedy as a some sort of competetive weapon would probably far outweigh any advantages we get from whenevr we do need to make comparisons.

tl;dr I can't think of any general scenario in which not being allowed to make comparisons of this type would be some kind of benefit, even if in one scenario it might silence those who would use the comparisons for less-than-savoury purposes. In fact I can only see that it would be harmful, because comparing outcomes is a fundamental part of affecting those outcomes for the best.

I haven't slept for about 50 hours now, starting to see little dots on things. I'm gonna go take a chill slumber. That's not to say I don't mean what I wrote just that I accept that it's egregiously long-winded for what it is."

I'm not a fan, I live in the UK, the game barely exists here. He was one of maybe two basketball players I could name, which highlights how much of a basketball legend the man was.

Does it? I think we all know what someone means when they say evil or bad, or morally wrong, even if we might disagree with whether actions are bad or good."
philosophy,ffih07v,t1_ffiftti,1579973661.0,"The author hopes people see it as an absurd conclusion because it is an absurd conclusion. Humans can certainly be evil, or anywhere in between, but to say outright that they are evil is ridiculous, especially for a reason as absurd as ""they effect the environment"". That's the point of making the argument, because it leads to a conclusion that is ridiculous if you follow it to a logical if somewhat absurd conclusion.

I think you're being slightly disingenuous, either you didn't read the article or you don't want to understand what the author is trying to say. The author is not saying that damaging the environment isn't bad, they're saying it's bad because of the consequences damaging the environment has on those living in the environment. You can disagree with this, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it myself, but to misrepresent what the author is saying isn't ok."

Plus it's usually not really about sex, or rather, what gratifies them sexually or even just emotionally is the power they have over someone else, their ability to force them into it. So when I say they're attracted to kids, it might be that they only find kids sexually attractive, but the reason for that could be because they know they can dominate and abuse them, if that makes sense."

todayilearned,ffe7kay,t1_ffdo6r0,1579838831.0,">Ascribing individual human behaviours to genetics is entirely subjective IMO

There have been studies of twins showing that there is a genetic component to our personalities. You couldn't ascribe any single behaviour to any single cause because human's just don't work like that. Saying genetics is the only thing that matters or even the most important thing would be going too far, but there's not much doubt that genetics are a factor in who we are and how we behave.

This is an assumption on my part but I see it often; I think it's more likely that your views about things like responsibility cause you to not want to acknowledge a genetic component to behaviour, but genetic predispositions don't undermine moral agency, or necessarily lead to fatalism, even if it does cause us to ask some difficult questions. I'm not 100% sold on [compatibilism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/), but it's definitely worth looking into as a starting point if you're interested in this sort of thing."
