Maybe you can find a way to share this together. It's fine to talk about it & a good friend will understand. Explain what you said in this post. Have discussions about how you don't feel the need for religion to be a moral person.

If you're a history person, maybe you guys can connect over church history. Maybe discuss it as leadership. Either way, you don't have to be a Christian to be friends with one, & vice versa. Diversity of beliefs/thoughts can be a good thing, for you both."

My grandparents used to own one(small town, about 500 people, no 400k dollar cars here).   


But let's take another recent anecdotal example I know of. Barstow CA, I used to go the laundromat once a week. No attendant. While I was there, you'd usually have between 20-40 dollars worth of customers. Didn't matter if it was Saturday morning or Monday afternoon. So 10 hours a day, at 20 per hour, for 365, you're looking at 70k gross revenue right there, for something you can run after work. In a  town with 20k, not around 1 million like OP says.   


So if this guy has a 9-5 job & the laundromat is retirement/extra money, he could easily afford that car."

A friend of mine and I have been starting to research some tech ideas in the tree/plant farm space, but our background is in sales/marketing. 

&#x200B;

A note of encouragement: For a small business owner, you're already doing a great job of experimenting, measuring, & tracking results. I've had some giant clients who couldn't figure out that part.  


On Facebook, you can do ads/marketing, though they're taking out some of the targeting tools that used to let you get super niche. Another Facebook thought is to create a company Facebook page and to also post to Facebook Marketplace. Also, have you considered printing up some hang tags with directions to add a hashtag or tag your company once the tree is planted? This could be a great way to have your customers generate some content for you & give you photos of trees in their permanent places.  


Do you do any wholesaling or selling to local landscapers? Could that be an option?
