Fine <unzips>"
LatinoPeopleTwitter,ff7im6d,t1_ff6rm3g,1579650414.0,"“Follada”. Siii, es de la región y sabe de que habla. No! lmao"
asianpeoplegifs,ff7i39s,t3_es0xx2,1579650063.0,"Way I do it, i measure off that left wall and the bottom edge to the center of both. Faster and just as effective. Great for DIY homeowners with time and money to spare on tools they’d use once but “worth” the expense for the social media cred farming you get, I suppose."
CatastrophicFailure,ff7c1vt,t3_eryufl,1579646028.0,"If such “country” was  actually allowed to become a country, and if their people weren’t systematically treated like 4th rate humans with separate (military) laws for this long, and if they weren’t talked about as if they were the SS reincarnated and in charge while ironically allying with only far far right governments, maybe we’d have an at least a Peter Beinart level argument here instead of this Jabotinsky sound bit."
CatastrophicFailure,ff7axf8,t1_ff79ard,1579645024.0,"If the bragging is low level, you’ll hear a “look what you made me do!”  when another house gets demolished or a whole bldg gets bombed by jet fighters or a journalist/EMT got shot in the knee/eye. Pointing that out even if the one saying it is another Jewish person: bigotry. Brilliant."
CatastrophicFailure,ff79rmq,t3_eryufl,1579644062.0,So I see Europeans can’t handle the gassy humus/falafel too well.
CockTributes,fem4py7,t3_epqjcv,1579239688.0,"Can we see more of her online, who is she?"
trashy,felgscj,t3_epmtz0,1579221815.0,"Frankly, people either assuming OP actually took the picture or getting all worked up because it’s a fucking repost are almost if not as trashy as grandpa creepo in the image."
trashy,felgckp,t1_fekf220,1579221526.0,"Nah. It’s been around for a while in internet years, it’s from Mexico (see a hint on the banner up above), and she turned out to be early 20’s.  
Grandpa is 475 y.o. tho."

trashy,fel7w1x,t1_fel1pqr,1579215969.0,"Around here the cops are just as bad and often don’t care for parking signage either. If you drive behind them you see them disregarding using the blinker or pretty much anything else. Not a fuck the police thing, just a fact."
trashy,fel7i1l,t1_fek3efs,1579215724.0,Plot twist: a local cops does that too along whatever douchebag parent gets the spot first at my kid’s grade school every morning.
trashy,fel7dex,t3_epl6rf,1579215644.0,"Dropping off my kid at grade school every morning has me witnessing the most selfish,  douchebag and aggressive driver behavior I’ve ever experienced. Trying to park or even simply to cross the street involves more quick thinking and Ninja moves against their suburban road rage, much worse than whatever I ever saw in Los Angeles or Boston."
trashy,fel6ddq,t1_fc0vtty,1579215024.0,You saying it’s Gen X ers then? Because I don’t think  it’s anywhere in the boomer radar. The content often seems pretty millennial n I see mostly millennials in my Facebook feed sharing it tho.
trashy,fel59nw,t1_fc08bme,1579214350.0,Worse. At least tabloids don’t do daily 25 this and 34 that shitty Amazon clickbait lists.

watchpeoplesurvive,fel3p9p,t3_epl37z,1579213388.0,"I want to agree with chalking it up to Americans because most of the world first sees the reference on an American movie or show, but then I recall how often you hear it in Spain seemingly every time they spot an assumed  Brit within hearing distance."
watchpeoplesurvive,fekzgw3,t1_fekw3qn,1579210821.0,I’ve heard people say wrong side of the road  in every non Brit commonwealth country  I’ve visited when watching a British show or film or when discussing the “proper” driving side.
watchpeoplesurvive,fekyfu3,t1_fekwq61,1579210200.0,"Arguing a parent’s actual experience of what dumb things kids do or why they  do it via copy pasting a dictionary definition. Brilliant, UNICEF ambassador material here."
worldpolitics,fejr40l,t3_epg0lf,1579183747.0,"They’re so bent on helping their orange demigod that they don’t care to consider his admission about the embassy threat been all made up and now fully support the Saudis. One day where the Saudis have been finally removed  they’ll be talking about the good old days of Saudi tyranny. The only regimes we loathe are those we don’t control. Stop supporting Cairo, Riyadh and Tel Aviv, and then we can begin talking about pointing fingers at whatever other assholes are doing elsewhere."

fightporn,feedifg,t1_fedrrjw,1579031517.0,"Under other circumstances I’d agree. Here, not at all. More fucked up is to not get upset at a rapist been confronted for a change."
fightporn,feed5hq,t1_fecsnct,1579031306.0,A rapist like him probs my would have if it wasn’t broad daylight and he wasn’t facing several men. A guy like that don’t carry a knife around just because.
fightporn,feeczei,t1_fecr9dw,1579031209.0,Or record it if you’re going all the way. This was rather unsatisfactory.
Whatcouldgowrong,feeb6nn,t1_fedmca9,1579030157.0,"Similarly, My wife used to dislike PDAs and holding hands when we were dating even a couple of years into it. Nowadays she throws at me “how come you don’t hold me and kiss me in public?” Marriage amirite."
PublicFreakout,feea673,t1_fedtibu,1579029566.0,"Might be fake, but Methheads do this and much worse, easy. The “real homeless drug addicts” part is a dead give away of someone just guessing how that works"
