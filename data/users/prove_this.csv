Lifestyle is the number 1 predictor of disease in old age and also lifespan. Genetics is about 10%, I do believe the genetic component becomes more pronounced once you approach and pass 100 years.

If you want to extend your healthspan....stop eating so much food and stop eating constantly. You're not a cow, you don't have to graze all day long. One meal a day, or eat every other day with only water on the fasting day - if that is too hard just skip breakfast and eat in an 8 hour window from lunch to tea only.

There's a lot you can do to control your destiny. Supplements that can reduce your susceptibility to the diseases of aging, others that proactively slow down the aging process itself; lifestyle changes like exercise/diet; fasting also slows down aging.

A good book to read is Lifespan by David Sinclair.

Here's an example of what I do

Vegan diet - they just have by far the best mortality outcomes compared to vegetarians and omnivores. Vegetarians are closer to omnivores than vegans on health outcomes, but slightly better.

Fasting - I eat every other day unless I'm doing a longer fast cycle. For example I eat one day, then fast the next day or I eat two days in a row and fast for the next two days.

Exercise - moderate, frequent exercise is good. I also lift weights like squats and deadlifts.

Supplements - I take anti-inflammants like curcumin/berberine (also helps with diabetes); polyphenols like reservatrol. Also don't under-estimate the mighty multi-vit. :)

People of our generation will decide when they want to die. By not educating themselves on the topic, many people are making that decision for themselves already."

IAmA,feg96od,t3_eorio3,1579083079.0,"Hi David,

I've read your book a few months ago. I ended up getting reservatrol, berberine and curcumin supplements. I've also switched from a vegetarian to a vegan diet after seeing mortality outcomes across a lot of sources.

One thing that I've started on and am very keen on is fasting.

I started with alternate day fasting, where I would eat until 7-8pm, not eat the next day then have breakfast the day after for 36 hours in a fasted state. In the 5 weeks since I've started doing that I've now worked my way up to doing 60 hour fasts with ease. It looks like many of these studied compounds are really just stimulating the same pathways from fasting.

I recall seeing a study where rats on alternate day fasts lived 80% longer. Due to differences in rodent metabolism I don't fully know how to translate that into human terms. Is that equivalent to a human fasting for one week and then eating for one week? (8 times faster metabolism); a human fasting for one day a week? 

My current understanding is that if I have a 5 day fast once a month, a 2 day (60 hour) fast each week and perhaps the odd alternate day on remaining segments of the calendar then I should be able to net all the benefits of fasting?

If you could put someone with high will power on a fasting regimen intended to extend lifespan - what would you go for?"

I agree submarines will take a huge toll. ASW for the PRC is the big unknown.

I guess they won't do anything until they're confident they can win on that front.

Idk about the economy argument. China has built amazing infrastructure, so whatever happens it can be on its feet very fast afterwards. Their infrastructure wipes the floor with the west. It's not ideal, but I would imagine a 10% drop in their economy would be easily recovered from, a 10% drop in the US one won't.

F-22, way better then Chinese fighters? Yeah.

It also has to land and re-arm at some point, good luck doing that when you're deep in Chinese missile range.

I would urge some caution on the PRC being navally inferior, it's true for carriers and submarines. Not so true for their type 55 destroyer - arguably the best destroyer in Asia. I can put out the missile barrage of some entire navies.

Ultimately China is a navy and military in transition, it will have weak points. It is however so strong on numbers of units in the theatre a war vs Taiwan will be fought in that numbers will count. This war will just be too close to PRC shores, that's all it comes down to.

Whatever trump can do beyond that is merely nibbling at China.

Even ZTE/Huawei....the PRC wanted to build its own supply chains and now it has a reason to do so...it was even a government strategy called made in china 2025.

What trump is doing is helping China restructure in a way that will make the taiwan war less painful. It's like being given a small dose of american aggression as a vaccine. Now they're going to be immune to it when the usa really wants to ape out."

Best quote on reddit I've seen in a while. On some level we're all the result of this process. We had crusades against pagans in northern and eastern europe to spread Christanity at the point of a sword...there are many examples of this process.

I have been shocked at how militant Uyghur's were - including mass stabbings that made it out to the global media. It makes you wonder what Uyghur terrorists were doing that were being covered up by Beijing.

I don't think cultures that make war inside of state borders should be tolerated. Cultures that fight by the sword, can die by the sword. Islam should take heed."

The actual comparison is that the Chinese budget is about 75% of the USA one when adjusted for costs. Given that the USA is spending to dominate the entire globe whilst the Chinese are just concentrated in one area; the Chinese spending greatly outstrips the funding for any task force that the USA could put together for that part of the world."

worldnews,fcu4085,t1_fcu3l1f,1577971980.0,"Enforce embargo, divert Taiwanese planes to defending their rear and prevent outside assistance from breaking through to Taiwan.

The carriers are the flanking force for the invasion, they will maintain air control over the sea in Taiwan's rear.

I've not seen anything suggesting that the Taiwanese airforce can defeat the Chinese one - that seems a bit off from what I know - is there some specific reason you believe that's possible?

My understanding of the situation is that China needs its flanking force complete and it also needs more redundancy on sea lift. If it can lose 50% of its sea lift ships that are ferrying its forces over, it can probably win the war."
worldnews,fcu0qko,t1_fcu0ejw,1577968543.0,"A nuke might be able to sink a carrier, but I do recall a test against US carrier built in the 60s failed to sink it. You basically need a direct hit, with a nuke.

Carriers don't get sunk by torpedos. you incapicate a carrier by rendering its flight deck inoperable (i.e. gouge out some holes in it); destroying its air wing in the air; or by taking down its command+control platform. They're just too big with too many water-tight compartments.

It has a brand new carrier that's not ready for war yet. It needs both carriers working to get an OK carrier fleet by putting both in the same fleet.

Burning is part of the life cycle for these places. Some trees have seeds that \*wont\* open until there has been a forest fire, suppressing these fires prevent these trees from renewing themselves. They operate on temperature."
