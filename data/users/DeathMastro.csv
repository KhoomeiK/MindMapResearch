absolver,ff7xavo,t1_ff6f1mn,1579660563.0,"It’s a fail safe your throwing a move instead to using your style. The reward is if they feint the move you plan to avoid you will still hit them depending on your frames on your avoid and if their move they Feinted has a certain amount of frames to it. The favor is yours. The more you use it the more your depended on it. If you watch glock, me, rouge, pie, Relloh, Kurly, Obi. Ect. We don’t use it because it would make us use our style less."

absolver,ff49clt,t3_er323a,1579558378.0,RogueSamurai used to have a different account and he was a Kahlt but he had moves at one point that did the work and countering for him. It is true that you won but that doesn’t make you way of fighting admirable. Look at the way Rogue fights he doesn’t use avoid moves or Charge attacks. He is fighting you with his judgment and skill purely alone. That is something that you must respect because it is what you can never become because you will never try. So use your Avoid moves and Charge attacks and parry strikes as you please you won’t get any better with your style doing what you do now. That is just what I can see.

It doesn’t really matter to me if a sword is pulled on me but if I have low health and they pull it out for the cut to kill me then it just shows they are desperate to win and not to learn. If you pull swords in the beginning that shows me that you are during swords and I don’t need to worry for any surprises.

Your retaliation is limited to your front stances and the low parry can some times freeze you. The back stances are 9frames of advantage and but you can still be gold linked jabbed out of your counter strike. Because the slow frames sometimes won’t be applied or your opponent or other problems.
