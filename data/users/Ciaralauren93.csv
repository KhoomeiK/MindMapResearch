Advice,fehgleh,t1_feheo9f,1579116111.0,"The worst pain I've ever been in.
 

So I get Thanksgiving and Black Friday off for work which was the 28th & 29th.
My surgery was the 26th, my sister had to drive me and wait for me (about an hour total) and I was knocked out the whole time.
I fell asleep when I got in the car ride which was 5-10 minutes and fell asleep once I got to her house.
She went to get the drugs prescribed (Percocet and something for nausea) and a smoothie. I had some of the smoothie and took the medication (you need someone with you during recovery to make sure you take medication every 6 hours for the pain) and I threw up immediately after. 
The throwing up was something I couldn't control, it happened when I woke up, went to the bathroom and in the shower the hour after waking up (apparently that's normal for anesthesia) but it was painful because I had nothing, even water in my system and I was drugged up and crying because I couldn't stop gagging. (I threw up like 8 times in my life prior to that and I'm 26)

So basically for the 4 days that followed I had no appetite and ate 1 jello cup or pudding cup but not because I couldn't have food but because I wasn't hungry. I lost 10 pounds in 5 days.
I also was completely drugged up, which I hated because I haven't ever been on drugs and didn't like the feeling of being numb and not productive.

I went back to work on my 8th day of recovery and was fine but couldn't eat much and I was hella weak and got tired from walking up the stairs. 

You also have horrible breath after and the scabs coming off were gross and weird.

Swallowing was awkward and I almost choked on food when I tried to eat.

I stopped the Percocet after day 3 and toughed it out for the pain.

I think that was everything but by week 2 I was good and could breathe a whole lot better. A friend commented that I sounded less nasally too. I had my tonsils and adenoids removed.
I have a pretty high pain tolerance, have multiple tattoos and piercings but that pain took the cake. It's also a mental thing because you're completely out of it because of pain and meds so I don't remember much of what was going on that week. I slept most of the time but you have to wake up every so often because drinking water is the biggest key to recovery."
