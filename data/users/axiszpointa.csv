edit: gah, i don't see it.  I've never set a flair before.  what am i doing wrong?

edit: oh, now i see it.  woops

edit: btw, tq+ is in regards to being trans, not in regards to being some kind of ""pansexual"".  which is part of my earlier gripe, because how are you going to say that we would be wlw on the fact that you a transwoman and i'm a female presenting trans man when if we're basing orientation on both/either gender or sex our coupling would be straight.  if you're saying that your hormones makes your female gender identity trump my male gender identity to categorize the orientation of our relationship you need to go talk to the other trans* people or be more specific that what you're calling trans is what was once called transexual until transexual became non pc.  because at a certain point when you're insisting we're lesbians because you're a trans woman and i'm a trans man i'm thinking for you that it's less about respecting gender i.d. and more about lesbian roleplay.  which to me, is kind of offensive to women who are attracted to women in addition to women who identify as men, so maybe the ally flair would work too?

anyhow, i probably won't be returning to comment very much because bi issues aren't my issues, but that whole pan thing i had to comment on when i saw it. tras are trying to make bi issues my issues, but i don't think that's the case, i think that would just be a true straight talking over bi people if i bought into that."

Boy socially transitions and grows some boobs, and since i still care about this person and have romantic feelings they claimed that made me bi.  And i wasnt into the boobs, this bi-ness was based purely on their female gender idenity.  I could see if i was into their new look that might mean i should explore whether i might be bi, but i wasnt into the feminised appearance, i just still liked the person who id known as a boy.

I think technically i would be pan since i would be interested in dating someone regardless of how they feel about their gender, but im attracted to MALES regardless of their identified gender, which is functionally no different from being het.  Its def not trans inclusive in the ways trans people would like either.  So to me, since im ""technically"" pan but heterosexua, i feel like people who use it to virtue signal hearts not parts arent even accurate.

I may be wrong about what pan is, but ive def been told by trans that being attracted to male trans as a female is not het.  Which to me would fall und...

Ok, i googled.  It clearly says OR, not AND.  Pan is:  not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity.

i might have said ""you"" a few times while arguing with some of the other commenter's opinions still rattling in my head at the same time, but my main argument was agaisnt the dudes on hear saying that they can't understand why there's any kind of standards for who they're going to sleep with. sorry for reading what you were saying so wrong and also if i was mean.

PurplePillDebate,fetqlds,t1_fetnc5n,1579378445.0,"at no point have i been telling you you need to have some deep involved lifelong love relationship, all i've been saying is that there should be more that goes into picking which guy to fuck than the fact that he's up for sex and you're attracted.  i didn't put an arbritary timeframe on the vetting, i just said it's an important part of picking a (hopefully) less disappointing sexual partner.  and you argued which implied that vetting isn't a part of getting your high libedo satisfied and that it's just all about the act of sex and the guy doesn't matter. 

if you've had piv sex with 4 dudes, but more sexual partners than that, than not going all the way with every guy.  That's literally exactly what i'm advoating that you do, if a guy seems like he's sexually incompatiable as you progress toward sex, reject him instead of fucking him.  You've been making it out like you can't decide whether or not you want to fuck someone until after you've fucked them.  You're compeltely turning this around when you're talking about people vetting for casual sex, because you've been presenting it that the fucking is the be all end all when really you're doing the exact same shit 90 percent of other women do and using special difficult words to describe it to be contrary.  

i never said wait months to have sex with a guy, i said that he needs to bring more to the table than just having a dick and you need to take enough time to ferret that out before fucking him.  which if you've only fucked 4 guys then it seems like you're doing exactly what i've been advocating doing, and then just arguing for no reason.  

i don't know you're age, but nothing about having had sex with 4 men says to me that you have a high libdo.  

you do realize that if you're vetting these guys and there's only been four of them, even if it was only in a one year period since you lost your viginrity that's still going to be either 6 months per dude, or a whole lot of celebacy.  that is either not causal sex or not bothing to seek out sex and being satified with a lack of sex despite your high libdo.  unless you started dating last week and are now engaged, you're not exactly sleeping around.  

everything you said could be paraphased as ""i don't rule out a guy as fuckable until i've tried him out"" and ""i have nsa sex just for the sake of sex at the whims of my high libedo"".  but all of those details you put about 4 dudes and marry the fourth completely contradicts the entire attitude of all of your previous comments.  

how are you having a high libdo and not caring about relationships as part of sex, and enjoying sex with no shame and slept with 4 dudes?  that sounds less like a high libdo and more like sexual frustration.  

everything i've been advocating for that you've been arguing agaisnt sounds like it's what you're already doing!

going at kind of extreme, assuming you've been fucking for a year, you've either spent most of the year celibite or most of the year fucking the same dudes.  if you're painting sleeping with the same friend for 6 months and not sleeping with anyone else as having causal sex you have a wildly different idea of what casual sex is than i do.

oxford describes causal sex as sexual activity between people who are not established sexual partners or do not know each other well.  having sex with someone you're hoping is going to be your long term fuck buddy isn't what i'd call causal sex.  that's a relationship. fucking the same dude you fucked last week and the week before going back for months isn't causal sex, lol.  and ending up marrying one of them really doesn't sound like casual libdo driven sex at all."

PurplePillDebate,feti65r,t1_fes9tnk,1579375667.0,"If youre wasting time because you think youre supposed to be exclusive with someone who youre not even fucking yet then thats youre own mistake.  

Lets say sex takes at least 2 hours with travel time.  In that time that youre being disappointed with one man, you could go on four coffee dates, jude the guys agaisnt each other, and then pick the best option thats most likely to please you instead of stopping the search at guy 1 to fuck him and missing out on potentially better options.

If the dude isnt getting you off and giving you good sex thats because you picked the wrong dude.  Im trying to explaim that can be avoided by filtering out guys who are shitty in bed before you fuck them.

As an example: you have a very specific sexual need that only a subset of men can fill.  Lets say its bdsm (or it could be amazing cunnilingus, whatever).  Before you jump into bed with him, if you want him to meet youre standard for good sex, your best bet is to start with guys who like to eat pussy or guys who like bdsm.  Then you can prioritize that the kink king is most likely to get you off compared to the person only curious about it.  And anyone who think bdsm is a perversion would be best ruled out immediatly if that sexual ability is important to you.  If youre fuckng him before you even get to a place of disclosing youre secret kinky fantasies then its very unlikely that the sex will be good.

If one of you thinks licking assholes is disgusting and the other requires asshole licking to come, that coupling should be ruled out before the bad fucking begins.  When you add in all the variations on sexuality and also personalities, then it makes more sense to find people who are compatible.  Which if youre reason to sleep with men indiscriminatly is that youre getting bad sex then youre obviously not doing that work of weeding out the bad sex.  

(I dont mean bad sex like in any rapey way but just guys who dont know how to operate a vaginia.  Im talking about bdsm, before that there way more basic stuff like does he know where the clitorous is and how foreplay works."
PurplePillDebate,fetgrpg,t1_fesex31,1579375270.0,"What extra standards do you have beyond getting off enjoyably with a man that youre eager to have sex with?  Youre specifically talking about sex and not intimacy.  Everything youre describing as high standards seems like youre either describing the mans inadaquecy to please or your own inability to direct him how to please you, not high standards.  

My scenario: only men who have shown they can put in the work and arent a disapointment get to fuck because i dont want to have shitty sex

Youre scenario:  having sex with anyone attractive to you without regard for the ability to please you.

Just as a hypothetical period of time, lets say it takes the both of us sorting through 20 men over the course of 2 months to find a suitible lay.  In youre way you would be fucking a new guy every other day and have fucked 19 bad fucks to find the one quality fuck out of 20.  Having standards to me would be instead of having those 19 bad unsatisfying experiences, instead of trying out fuckboys 1-19 and being disapointed they cant fuck good, you would spend time not having sex checking how good your chemisty is together.  And then, instead of fucking a guy whos not worth your time just to make sure, move onto the next one.  I think it would also be a more time consuming search if you need to make time to fuck before each rejection.  I could be done rejecting the first 19 dudes and found the needle in the haystack and be fucking him while youre still experimenting with bad dick.

To me youre scenario is low standards and mine is high standards."

PurplePillDebate,ferstww,t1_ferjayf,1579357990.0,"i don't understand why talking longer to warm up to a man you're serious about is an indication of being a gold digger to you though?  if anything it indicates that you're taking the relationship seriously and that he means more to you than what he can give you in this particular moment to pleasure you.  

honestly, at this point i feel like saying ""stop lying.""  how can your inetnion in pushing these ideas be anything other than to maniuplate women who have boundraiers and want only sex in a relationship to lowre their standards, not to prevent gold diggging, but for the inentinoal purpose of getting girls to put out and making it easier to trick her.  

i've been engaging with you in good faith, but i just got really angry, because it's really really really hard to read this as anything other than an attempt at gaslighting.  why the hell am would i respond to boogeymen man stories about a tiny minority of corrupt women by in turn corrupting myself?  that makes no sense.  

like, it seems like you're trying to argue that it's good to stay safe from gold diggers.  but the things you are saying are exactly the kind of things you would say if you thought the standard for women for sex should be that commitment-free sex is the norm.  all of your solutions to gold diggers are just that women should have sex before they're ready.  any time someone is criticizing womens sexual boundaries that kind of invalidates the criticism to me and make me start to look at them kind of suspect.  

if the solution to anything is to put out, i feel like that solution was forced.  

for example, racism against and has been an ongoing thing that ive heard about with black people.  when the mormons went to utah, part of their solution to the problem of slavery and how to deal with that mark of cain thing was to try to play it both ways and condem both slavery AND black people.  

The mormons tried to manage this black problem of thinking the blacks are inferior but also thinking that slavery is immoral.  one of their policies was to not teach black people mormon stuff that might rile them up and make them rebellious.  it def makes sense to try to placate the slaves when you're trying to build your slavery free white mormon utopia because you don't want to piss of pro-slavery people.  if you talk to the slaves about anything about rebelion or freedom, then you have to deal with the very real issue of even more racist white people (who you're in conflict with, hence fleeing to utah) taking an issue with you.

so, these mormons had an actual reason not to tell the slave emancipate yo self.  BUT, when they're dealing with that whole mark of cain thing turning humans brown to denote who's the sinner and excluding blacks from the churches and the ceremonies, that stragetic point gets drowned out by the racism in my perception of the situation and i don't think ""good decision not to start a civil war"" but instead think ""racist fucks""

any argument that involves a women letting down her guard about her sexual boundaries i'm going to read in bad faith.  the fact that you have such a disproportiante concern about gold diggers that you feel comfotabe saying things that imply that the vast majority of women who want to wait until their comftoable in a realationship would be golddiggers.  basically the gist of what you're saying to me is that requiring comminent for sex makes a woman a gold digger.  .  

now, you may be feeling some what offended and attacked that i would paint your fear of gold diggers as a disingenious manipulation tactic.  especially since up until this point we were basically exchanging ideas in good faith.  but really its the exact same accusation you just made to me and most women by saying that requiring comitment is golddigging.  

if you said ""requiring a real ""relationship"" relationship with all of the trappings before even having sex seems like a red flag for gold diggers if you're trying to avoid the possibility of being gold dug"" or ""seeing as how manipultors... well... manipulate, i'm not going to put myself in a potentially vulnerable situation because if she's a master manipulator i won't be able to tell if she's using me for money so for me relationships are going to start with sex, not me being an errand boy bank account because that's just not a risk i'm willing to take is reasonable.  

but you're coming across as waiting until the relationship is established is basically golddigging.  that's not true.  it may or may not be gold digging and it's not fair to call all women liars just because some of them are lying, and its not fair to shit all over someones morals or boundraies or values when it comes to sex.  

like, if i was talking about dating risks, i could talk about it two ways.  i could say ""i'm not going to that guys place until i know him better because some men are violent or rapists and that's a risk i don't want to take"" and ""every guy who tries to get you to come home alone with him is trying to rape you (he's most likely trying to have consensual sex, just like i think these chicks are most likely trying to having a loving relationship.

framing this as what women are doing wrong as liars/prudes is a way different thing from stating what risks you see and the actions you take to avoid them.  there ARE risks in being played for a chump and a risk of losing your shit.  but as a female, i'm acutely aware that the solution to predators is to protect yourself from predators, not tsk tsk the predator and tell them they're bad.  the solution to your fear of gold diggers is date a woman who provides for herself, who agrees with you on the way finances should be split (shit, you could get a girl to take YOU out to dinner, i mean if you weren't married.  hypothetical you), and maybe get a prenup.  the solution to not getting used for dinners is to have an honest conversation about splitting the check before hand.  

you know that the way you appoarch a girl sexually can have an effect on whether or not she wants sex.  well unless they're reading feminist dating strategy stuff, are poor (in which case switch it up with free poor people stuff like people watching or going to nature, they probably just want to spend time with you anyway) for MOST people, i think who is paying for dinner is more of a shit test than about who's actually paying for dinner.  the same skills you use for seduction in readng her and giving her what she wants you can use to present your boundraires about money in a palatable way.  

you can be careful with your money because strangers are threatening WITHOUT needing to imply (accuse) that girls who are accustomed to a more traditional progression in the relationship are deliberately manipulating men for money or that their sexual values are out of whack.  to the girl who is not gold digging and just looking for someone to fall in love with and husband, it's an indirect attack on her intergrity and in the same sense that negging make you want to prove yourself basically you insulted her in a way that the instinctive human drive for fairness and reciprocity (look of hare Krishnas and their flowers) is going to make all women feel like they are obligated to pay for the date when i think it comes down to individual circumstances.  if you make 150k and she makes 20, no she should not be paying for half of yalls plane tickets, that's pure bullshit, she wouldn't be going on a fancy international trip if you didn't pull her up into this fancy stuff in the first place.  likewise you don't take her to fancy place and expect her to pay unless it's been discussed, but if there's a big economic disparity it's really unfair to except her to level up her lifestyle on her own budget to match yours.)

then, in addition to this negging that will supr her to spend, you're also encouraging it as a norm for women to put out with a guy they like before they're ready to.  remember, i'm telling you how most women are going to read your criticsm, not gold diggers.  you are telling people who think that maybe think sex is sacred  and want a spiritual bond (or whatever the fuck their non gold digger reason for boundaries is) that they're at risk of being a gold digger if they don't reconsider how much they spend on men and how much they put out.  none of that is nesseracy to attack women like that to protect yourself."
PurplePillDebate,fergzsc,t1_ferfd89,1579353734.0,"what does the potential of sex have anything to do with gold diggers?  the gold diggers goal is to fuck the shit out of you until you commit to marriage and take half your shit.  gold diggers don't withhold sex.  nothing about being a gold digger implies anything about your sex life, it just means you're tricking the guy to get to his wallet.  which usually involves sex and marriage, so that you can legally own half his shit.  

a girl that you are being a fucking moron about isn't a gold digger.  a gold digger is someone who marries you specifically to get your shit and get your alimony.  nothing about when you have sex is going to protect you from that.  the only thing that will protect you from a goldigger is seperate acounts and keeping your info private, and even then they sometimes still have legal rights and can scam their way in, so you really need to be vigilant about them and how they're coming at you.  you can't rule out psychopathy on the basis of how easy she is.

a gold digger is trying to marry a rich guy.  a poor chick leeching off another poor dude or a chick who happens to fall inlove with a higher class guy that comes with an upgrade in lifestyle aren't really gold diggers.  gold digging is when you specifically hunt down rich men with the intention to marry them.

back to the concept of squandering resources, if you're making min wage and taking her to fancy $$$ restaurants that is squandering and dumb.  but the thought is often as important as the gift.  how quick someone is to have sex isn't any indication on if they're a gold digger or will make demands you can't meet for fancy dates and gifts.  

to me, there's 2 options.  either you successfully screened out gold diggers (i'm assuming you had relationships before you wife) which it seems you have experience with or you converted a potential gold digger to a non gold digger with your seduction skills.  The notion that the way you seduced her had anything to do with her wanting your money seems like it's giving you way more power over potential gold diggers than you would actually have over a sneaky manipulaive person.  are you quick to dismiss that you learned to detect gold diggers and sniff them out because you're under the impression that all women are gold diggers and it is only giving them the opportunity to gold dig that creates a gold digging situation?  because to me a gold digger has no interest and is using you for sex, vs a non gold digger, while they may be a greedy or not, high mainentece, or not, is actually interested in you, not the money.  but if there's money, why not have some?  someone who is into you for real and then you happen to have money and they want acess to it isn't a gold digger to me.  to me a gold digger is when she pretends to like you for the money."
PurplePillDebate,fer3r10,t1_fer0kxb,1579349462.0,"ok, i'm not reading this whole thing before responding cos i had to say this now. a sexy man bringing up sex before we have an intimate enough relationship to discuss sex turns him from being attractive into being a creep and dries up my vagina.  

saying something stupid turns an attractive person into an ugly person (see how eliot rodger was kinda cute but still a virgin).  that stupid thing can be overstepping sexual boundraries.  obviously if you're attractive to me that's going to affective how recptive i am to your advances, but hot dudes can do creepy shit that makes them unfuckable.  for example, there was a guy i was going to have sex with until durring the discussion about sex he says he doesn't believe a woman can revoke consent after the sex has started.  i informed him that i don't believe a man should expect to keep fucking after a no and not get his throat sliced.  sex had been on the table until he was creepy, and then it wasn't.  if he's hot enough it's going to be more about the content of his sexual banter than the fact that it's sexual, but you can def make yourself ugly by the things you say and taking things too far too fast.  

i'm a lot more concerned about men taking my money/forcing me into dependency than getting money from men, so we def have different priorities there.  it is VERY fucking important that a man isn't going to be a leech to me because it's a lot harder to be a financially independent woman than man and i don't want to be taken advantage of.  

i would be asking about your job and car and housing trying to make sure you're not trying to take my car and strand me when i have a doctors appointment to get to and move in without paying rent and eat my food than i am about getting your money.  

there's not a way to seduce a woman that will make her not want your money, you have to talk to her and find out if she wants your money and then reject her if she does.  which will be harder if you get your emotions extra involved by fucking before you know her enough to know if she's a goldigger or a goldmine.

i'm not a fds-er and i don't know if this conforms to their views, but every single time i've dated a lower class guy he's tried to take advantage financially and my arbitrary rule that i've decided is not to date people who are in a lower economic class.  you can't judge all poor guys, and sometimes it's not them trying to take advantage, but that's just not a situation i want to deal with, especially with being autistic.

>All you’ve done is shown why women shouldn’t have sex quickly/early, even if they do like sex.

I'm explaining that the phenomenon you're describing of ending up in the wrong relationship after rushing into sex has a chemical basis behind some of it.  even if you didn't orgasm and that wasn't the case in your situation, it's a real risk of casual sex that you may feel bonded to a person you wouldn't choose to if you hadn't had sex.

i think i misunderstood what you were saying because i thought you were saying why you shouldn't have sex too quick and i was chiming in with ""yeah, here's the scientific evidence,"" but now it seems like you were making a different point that i don't get.  your first comment reads like you're warning against casual sex but then when you're rejecting the science behind why it's a bad idea it seems like you must have been saying something different because when i tried to support that casual sex leads to bad relationship decisions you've been dismissive, so now i'm confused.

PurplePillDebate,feqh09b,t1_feo85h6,1579341786.0,"i think what you're describing is how female sexuality works most of the time unless she's intentionally looking for a one night stand.  in other comments you're talking about stuff like dick size being a deal breaker.  i think if a girl is rejecting a dude she actually likes based on his dick she's got something wrong with her, even worse than the tall fetishists.   in the scenario where you're choosing between the exact same guy and one has a nicer dick, then the dick could be a dealbreaker but i think most of the time the dick isn't going to have much of an influence on which guy you pick.

here is an anaology:

girl one is a mediocre cook and you can't cook.  she makes you breakfast and dinner and packs you a nice lunch and makes perfectly edible foods for you, better than what you'd be doing on your own.

girl two is an amazing cook.  and she hates to cook.  and she resents making meals for men.  sometimes if the timing is right you get a few bites of amazing food, but it's a rare occurence.  maybe on your birthday she cooks you a dinner if you pressure her enough.

now, if you were going to pick one of those people to feed you, are you going to chose the person who made the best lanagane you ever had in your life, which you only got to taste once and then she never had the consistency to make again.  or are you going to go with the girl who makes you lasagana whenever you want it and the lanasgae is good and tasty and cheesy, you just wouldn't write a novel about it.

obviously, one lasagane is much better than the other, but having the capacity to make great lasanage isn't giving you a meal every day.

doing your meals is the relationship, and the content of the meal is the dick.  if the relasionship isn't there (you're not getting fed) then it doesn't matter how good the lasange she can make is or not.  while anyone would say, yes, good lanasgae over passable lanageae, most people would take a live in cook over a special birthday meal.  being able to cook may be a deal breaker for an individual, but in terms of competeition it's not just about one trait like how good you make lasauge or how big your dick is, but if you bring that suasage lasanga to the table.  there are many men who are a much better partner than the next dude over with a nicer dick."
PurplePillDebate,feqe72w,t1_feoka91,1579340769.0,"yes, but you have to vet a guy for capacity to communicate first."
PurplePillDebate,feqc8xe,t1_feplg52,1579340107.0,"hygiene isn't sexual compatibly.  dirty humans can wash off.  a couple who can't have a conversion about wash your stanky pussy and clean off that dick cheese probably isn't ready to fuck yet.

and for you other part in the prior comment, i'm think that dick size causing a physical compatibility issue is probably a 1 in 1000 thing.  if she's a size queen or wants a cute little dick, and that's a deal breaker, that's probably something she should bring up before fucking you, like during the parts of the relationship leading up to the fucking.  for example, if you are just absolutely disguised by fake tits and can't clock them on sight, then it's something you should bring up before you're actually touching her tits.  if you have abnormal physiology then that's something to bring up before the fucking.  i know some people have a different opinion, but at the point where she actually wants to fuck YOU, the person, you could have a 20 inch dick and make it work with some just the tip, rubbing it on the thighs  (intercrural sex, which is not just a female prude thing but something many men enjoy because gay dudes do it too), handjobs, oral, etc.  Or if you lost it in an accident if she's into you then likewise with the oral and other solutions.

i would want to know a guy well enough before sex that i know he's the kind of guy who isn't going to let little physical issues like a massive or minuscule cock get in the way of the fun.   or to have plenty of time to be aware that he's got a different understanding of what sex is supposed to be and therefore chose not to sign up for his disappointing sex.

seriously, penis size is not stopping people from getting off.  what's stopping them from getting off is their issues about penis size.  it's like you think that a dude with a legit gigantic cock needs to test all the pussys to find the 1 in 3000 girl would could handle a 20 inch dick (if she even exists) or that a girl with shallow pussy can only date a man with a micropenis.  That's not how sex actually works.  I have never been in a situation where someone's physical body made them unfuckable beyond not being attracted to their ugly body.  I had a sexual encounter with  a micropenis dude from the internet and i didn't even touch his dick (he jerked off on his face while i insulted his tiny dick, the first part being what i was into and the second part being what he was into).  At no point did his tiny dick take away from the eroticism.  


if you google intercrual sex it literally shows you a pic of two males (some ancient depiction of pedestary, kind of gross) dry humping, so don't think that intercrual sex is about being a prude who doesn't like sex.  it's a totally valid expression of sexuality."

PurplePillDebate,feq5ao3,t3_eq4yoi,1579337814.0,"would it be sexual dysfuntion if you come from stuff like piv (even the first time!) and just having a dude play with your nipples with his fingers (omg, that guy was so fucking gorgeous.  he was prettier than my carefully curated collection of sebastian stan pics).  and therefore are so orgasmic that you really don't need man  who can't out compete your carefully curated collection of Sebastian Stan pics for any of that? I'd rate myself at like a 7-9 out of ten in attractiveness.  but i've never painted not fucking a guy who hasn't made me want to fuck  him yet as a principled stance, that's just common sense.

i can think of 2 dudes who i was like, ""wow, disapointing"" and every other exerpeince was to the point that when i see women complaining about how men don't go down or don't make them cum i wonder exactly why they're getting such a high concentration of shitty men.  i think more likely than not, the guys who are making you cum are the ones who you have a level of intimacy with to want to fuck them (i'm not putting an exact time limit on it, and if anyone is giving you hard limits like ""3 dates"", or ""3 months"" it's probably in response to every single other guy who pushed her for sex before she even had the time to make up her mind if she wanted to have sex with him.  to me that seems kind of arbitrary and if it's the right time it's the right time no matter the calendar, but i def understand where it's coming from.

i think if you're not coming from most of your sexual encounters (aside from legitimate dysfunction) you're having that's a matter of having standards that are too low and you're not coming from having bad sex with men who don't give a shit about you that you don't have chemistry with.  but i think bad sex is more likely to lead to fake orgasms than demanding better and that having whatever standards you want for who you want to fuck is probably something that protects you from bad sex, not a result of bad sex.  i wouldn't know.  the worst sex i've had has been along the lines of, like, omg, i'm trying to explain bad sex i've had to show how mild the bad sex i'm having is compared to the orgasm-less sex you're picturing and like the worst sex was hooking up with a fwb/crush type guy i had a crush on who was really hot and the bad sex entirely came from noticing he'd gained weight, which made me realize that what i thought was a crush had really just been me lusting after his amazing body, not from any lack of effort on his part.  And one time a boyfriend was eating me out and he just wasn't doing it right.  Not a long line of bad sex leading me to have standards but rather standards preventing me from experiencing the bad sex that you're fantasizing that i've had.

she's not making you wait to reward you, she's making you wait to be sure she wants to fuck you because if she has reservations about fucking you, then it's going to be the bad sex with no orgasm.

i def would recommend to ladies that they download the most attractive pictures of their celebrity crush and every time they go to fuck a man stop and ask themselves exactly what he's bringing to the table that this photo of sebastian stan isn't.

i'm am autistic and a trans man (female body, male gender identity) but don't see why any of this wouldn't apply to neurotypical cis girls too.  


i don't think sexual compatibility is a big deal breaker though since i never saw it as a man's obligation to take care of my sexual needs or me his.  which is exactly the kind of thing that it could take several months to screen for."

While breathing in that fashion, focus on how when you breath in your pelvic floor drops and when you breath out it raises.  The ""dropped"" position is a relaxed pelvic floor.  (And how your pelvic floors should be when you shit.  Uncoordinated people often shit wrong and think theyre relaxing when tensing and vice versa).  Get your pelvic floor in the dropped position, both when pooping and when doing butt stuff, to help with your ass relaxing.

You need to open your butt the same way u open it to take a huge dump.  Some people might describe that as bearing down.  Its a relaxation thing and a lot of people arent good at even taking a big poop, let alone the reverse, so it requires coordination too.

For me, if i set about to ""relax my asshole"" i would actually be tightening it up.  Because if you're straining to poop, then your whole vocabulary could flip so that when you're straining you're under the impression you're relaxing and vice versa.  You relax your butthole to poop, so therefore copy pooping and you must be relaxing your butthole.  Ok, that only works if you're really relaxing to poop.  If you're squeezing out skinny cut off poops and code that action in your mind as relaxing, and then attempt to relax for butt stuff you're actually doing the opposite of relaxing and it won't work how it should.

And then, now, looking back, shes saying the baby just so happened to have put pebbles in her vagina before lena looked in there.  

Like, its one thing to say she was young and dumb, even for the teen stuff, but if my assumption that she put pebbles in her sis vagina and is lying to cover it up is correct, on the one hand i understand wanting to play it down, but to reflect on that time you obviously put pebbels in your sis vagina and instead blame lil sis, thats like 3 strikes.  

Strike 1, pebble vagina stuff, ok thats some dumb kid kid, people grow up and mature.  

Strike 2. Masturbating beside your kid sis whos 6 years younger than you and kissing her.  Having been molested by a sibling myself, i would say that teen is potentially still redeemable depending on their ability to reflext and grow empathy and act like a mature adult.  

But strike 3 is where shes telling this stuff like a joke, with the same kind of defense of putting pebbles in her sis vagina that child molesters give when they say they were seduced by a little kid.  I am 99 percent sure lena is lying and framed the sis for her own actions.  Still, as an adult, while shes telling the story for laughs.  

To me its way different to say i was 7 and didnt know better and now ive learned, or i was 13 and did this fucked up thing and realized how fucked up it was and would never do such a horrible thing now that i fully understand the weight of the situation.  But shes just like, ""i was doing sexual shit with my sis when she was a lil kid, lol.""  Even if there is zero chance shed ever molest a kid as a grown woman thats still a gross way to talk about it and very immature and making light of child molestation.  

But nothing she said even indicates she had a lightbulb change my ways moment and isnt a threat, to assume she wouldnt do the same thing again after the way she talked about it is just giving her the benifit of the doubt becauss shes a woman.

This reads like a police report where the cop is blaming the victim for police brutality.  If my impression that it was lena is correct than not only did she do weird shit, but then lied about it to minimize it and tried to act like the 1 year old did that of her free will, which goes beyond checking out junk, fiddling with junk, or even doing molesty stuff when you should be old enough to know better.

Basically the scenario where op is saying ""if i was pretty, then i could just have a really easy life just by putting out"" i think some people will say ""sweet"" to that deal and other people will kind of vomit.

What you are experiencing to me isnt the same as having a congenial facial deforminity of such severity youre labled mentally defective without justification.  Its more like an extreme  version of regular sexism.  I think when ugly people claim to be deformed thats not fair to people with actual deformities.  

My experince is that im told im  attractice and im autstic and girls who l dont think look as good as me have better luck with attracting men from being charming and gregarious and stuff like that.  Obviously social sskills and personality play some role.

Maybe u might have an undiagnosed deformity though.  Im just saying that while defomred people get consided ugly ugly and deformed arent the same thing."

PinkpillFeminism,fdkdgf0,t1_fdkc1sw,1578501540.0," i knew a beautiful girl who was ostracized and literally spit on from day one (she says it's cos she's a witch).  i never asked how she felt about her looks, but she could just as likely feel just as ugly as you and she was legit like mens fantasy of a sexy witchy pale redhead.  but she got negative feedback for being different (even for being beautiful).  sometimes when i look in the mirror my face looks kind of sideways.  unless some dr told you you're legit ugly i don't think that eiter social feedback or your assessment in the mirror tells us you're especially ugly.  people who like how they look, after years of looking in the miiror and saying ""i look good"" like how they look even more.  if you start on the edge and notice one good thing and then you're looking at yourself positive you'll notice and be biased to interpret those other things positive (sometimes people do a 180 on their nose after they change their perception because of a better appreciation for their culture and recognizing it as a feature of their people).  or fat people deciding they're not going to base their attractiveness on their fatness with realize they look better because they're looking at themselves with love.    


if, on the other hand, you're regularly looking in the mirror and pointing out how you have a dog face, you're literally training yourself to see it as ugly.  mirrors don't reflect exact reality (every mirror's gonna give you a slightly different image, cameras too) and a lot of what we see when we look at something is actually our brain filling in gaps in what we're taking in, and our brain is going to fill in those gaps ugly or pretty based on perception.   i'm not telling you you're not ugly, but if you can't see the difference between being ugly and being disfugred and thinking that you're face being unfortunate puts you on the same level of missing an eye or having a cleft palate or having half your face drooping from a stroke there's a good chance a lot of that is perception of yourself.    


the difference it makes is that you saying shit is fucked up and people picking on you doesn't actually tell us how fucked up shit is.  do you realize that there are pretty people with body dysmorphia who feel the exact way you do?"
PinkpillFeminism,fdkavq9,t1_fdk9ob7,1578499985.0,"Theres a huge gap between disfugred and pretty.  Nothing about not being az pretty as stacy means youre disfigu.  Compared to people with facial deformities, even girls who are fla out ugly are priveleged so still no need to pick on stacy.

i'm with you on seeing how women are treated differently and valued by their looks.  i'm 100 percent on board with it's fucked up that people look at stacy and treat her one way and look at you and treat you different.  but to me i would spent more time questioning that value system than being resentful at Stacy.  to be racist, because i hear making racial analogies is racist, that's like the field slave being mad at the house slave.  that anger should be directed at the master.  especially if people are showing you analysises of how the master set that rapey system up in the first place to sow division for better control. (i'm sorry about the analogies but that was legit a rape and based system.  they would rape the slaves, and then the whiter babies they'd put in the house and have in charge so that instead of the slaves being mad at the master, they had slaves mad at the other slave in charge and telling the one in charge he's better and giving privileges but they don't get to be free or break away  from that system, the privileges are just a trick to keep them compliant.  similar to setting poor whites agiasnt black people and telling them they're better than black people so that instead of poor people rising up together they're arguing about race.)"

Grannies get raped.  Obviously choosing to make porn and getting raped isnt the same exact thing, but the male tendency to take advantage of women sexually is present in both situations.

I think theres soft skills involved in sex work that also impact your ability to perform beauty.  Someone who can chat up a john might be more likely to have the skills to look good even if they weren't graced with special genetics.  However ugly you are unless youre at the extreme end of ugly can be compensated by perfoming beauty the same way youre performing sexuality.  You don't have to be a beauty to do sex work."

Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up."

edit: ambiguity about my race is cos it's ambiguous (i don't know!), not cos i'm playing games.  i've had people tell me i'm white and people tell me i'm black and people tell me i'm probably some other random minority, and usually the more passionate they are about the subject the more certainty they have when even i don't know.  (really weird, the more racist people are the more they want to claim me as their race.  i just read a study that black and white people categorized mixed people as black if they're under the impression they're disciminated (to claim and shelter or to distance depending on race) but ive had a legit neo nazi (dumped her after getting to know her better) and my racist adoptive mom both telling me i'm white, but then i've had really strident black pride types insist i'm black and be very angry that i'm so racist agaisnt black people to deny my blackness. but then i get, oh, i you so exotic  maybe youre an arab.  if it wasn't so dangerous i'd just post a pic and let you make up your own mind."

Would u ask a rich white woman in usa what rights women dont have when women are being fgm and treated as slaves and exploited world wide?  First world gay issues are fuled by the fact that worldwide there are bigger issues. But you're not saying what are privleged first world gays doing to help other gay people, youre legit denying that there are gay rights issues.  To people who think globally you just asked why should we care about people just like us (ok, not me, but homosexuals, my lgbt brethern) being executed for being in iran since we can get married and adopted.  

There was an inkling of a valid critism of LGBt if you were aware there is persecution and people are comlaining about pride marketing, but u didnt give a nuanced criticism of LGBT being myopic (which would include ackwnolgeing limits on lgbt power and that rich comfortable gays maybe dont have an extra moral imperative any more than any other rich person just because theyre gay, so its not really a gay criticism but actually a first world criticism blamed on gays) but what ur doing is flat out dying discrimination exists.  I used extreme examples but it varies across the world on levels as local as the family unit.

lgbt,fdfj1ce,t3_el3gm6,1578362848.0,"I feel like youre painting lgbt and allies a certain way by assuming theres some problem with straight white people.  I think straight white people who reflect on their straightness and whitness and straight white people who are defensive about their straightness and whitess and dont take the time to understand whats being criticized and instesd take it as an opportunity to feel victimized by minorities expressing emotions (not saying take unjustified shit but maybe reconize when someone is having a legit traumatic reaction to legit trauma instead of taking it like a personal attack and tone policing (omg, doing so much self reflection) will have a different experience of acceptance.  

And i would tottaly tell black peoole too tthat if white people are being shitty to rise above it, not in some christain forgiveness way or to take shit, but maybe dont let someones (potentially fringe) opinion define who you are.  You can figure our if youre a racist homophobic bigot who needs to sit down or someone with an opinion to share from some education and self reflection.  But youre whining about hostitility from sjws cos youre white and straight and theres two options.  They are being silly and should be dismissed or maybe you nerd to relect.  Neither dismissing people lashing out nor sharing a reasoned opinion begins with ""as a straight white guy"" i expect persecution.  It could very much be that youre meaning was ""as a straight white guy, im not trying to step on any toes and is it cool to ask this"" but it did not come across that way. 

 I havent read comments to see how other people reacted, so i hope im not being an asshole.  The race swap version of this to me would be like performing in a minstrel show for white applause.   If youre reaction to actual hostitltiy toward straight whites is to beg for forgivnes for shit u didnt do is lacking dignity and would be humilating to me imaging it swapped racially where im a black gay person begging hateful straight whites to accept my humanity.  But to me most people can tell that people need to vent and the whole ""im a hated white man"" comes across as disingenous manipulation.  And its more likely that youre responding to legititme critiques of racism and homophobia as personal attacks.

Anyone hating on straightness and whitness is probably upset and thefore shouldn't be able to upset you.  What's more likely is they are ctiticzing the culture and attitudes of straight white, and thats feedback to actually listen to and by learning how to not be a straight white asshole is how you can be ok with being straight and white without assuming youre being lumped in with all of the other straight white assholes.

Im sorry if this is wrong to say and swapping things removes power imbalance, but if evey gay person introduced themsleves as im gay but ""im not a pedopfile"" just because they as an indiviudal have been lumped in with a horrible sterotype i wouldnt be able to tell if i should feel sad for other people telling him thats required to mention or why the fuck the fact that the existence of gay pedos means he needs to qualify hes not one and maybe he just gave me a hint he is one.  Putting all your effort into defying a sterotype is still being ruled by a sterotype, so if youre really being unjustly called a bigot let it go because internalizing it is making you one. Just make sure first cos this isnt an excuse to ignore legitinate grievences."
lgbt,fdff1wa,t1_fdfb4jg,1578360183.0,"I didnt fully digest yet but quick response: i would most naturally just say man and assume it includes trans, and then to specially distinguish cis in the context of discussing trans topics would call cis people non-trans or people who arent trans.

Unless man is being discussed specifically in terms of penis havers, i would assume im included, just in terms of how i percieve myself to be a man and its speaking to men.  When they are talking about something like prostate health, i see them as completely overlooking aspects of what a man is to simplify and appeal to the mainstream and that the material just isnt nuanced.  For example, material that would appeal to many men but mistaken assumes that all men are straight, or similarly superficial dogma in womens magazines, make me feel less like im being excluded from manness because of missing the trait of penis or or that since i dont idenity with the female gender i cant read an article about fribroids, but that that particular media assuming men are all cis or straight just dont have me on their radar than taking a discussion that overlooks me as specifically exclduing me from being a man.

Like if it said, ""hey men, look at these awsome tits"" i wouldnt question my maness over lack of internest in tits.  I would take it as the media is stupid and lacks nuance over feeling like ive been told im not a man.  Any discussion whatsoever of female gender just makes me feel like someone is ttrying to impose it on me.  Like if dudes were shit testing me telling me im not even a man, gendered expectations from that side would not bother me and id feel validated because whats more manly than the homosocial bonding ritual of shit testing.  The same kind of gender stuff from the other side, ""hey, since youre male then obviously not female"" i get biological about it and im like, no, girls can be boys too, just saying im not a girl because of my identity sounds like the flipside of the same policing that im not girl enough. 

Like, u could describe male gender and id be like, yeah, thats me, and then describe cis female gender and my whole reaction to that is thats just some bullshit box they try to shove trans boys into.  To me the notion of cis woman, the box ive been forcefully shoved in, just reminds me of my masculinity being policed.

I would explain to people who think its a slur to non trans people that its just a way of not othering transness when its being used to say someone is or is not trans.  So i have two views on it, cos i do think its better than calling cis something like normal.  But it also causes feelings."
