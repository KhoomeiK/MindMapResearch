But from my personal experience people taking mdma often Chase the serotonin effect of empathy and mild trippiness when abusing it. Tolerance in serotonin receptors skyrockets. For lsd isn’t isn’t unusual for double or trouble the dose to be needed the day after tripping. For this reason lsd and serotonin psychedelics are often thought to not be addictive really because it’s almost impossible to take daily because of tolerance. 

Back to mdma, it’s effect on serotonin decreases rapidly but it has multiple mechanisms of action I believe. So it still effects dopamine. I could be wrong on that but either way I see people taking insanely rapidly escalating doses on mdma much faster than other drugs. Meths tolerance takes longer to build so in the beginning it’s addiction can feel pretty mild.
