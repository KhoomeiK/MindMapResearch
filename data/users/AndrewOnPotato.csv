depression,fbxlkcu,t3_eez1m0,1577192924.0,"I'm sorry to hear you feel that way, I know all too well what that feels like and for me, personally, it's been that way for quite some time. I guess my advice for you would be learn to stop caring too much about others if it's not reciprocal or you feel like they want you out of their life. Instead, make yourself your first priority, focus on YOUR OWN self-growth, rather than helping some leeches. I've been trying to do that and not to be affected too much by this kind of things for the last few months and I see some improvements, I can at least say that. I can also tell you it's not easy, there are days when all of this shit gets to me, when I feel down or angry, but it's worth it and I definitely don't regret this change. And if this doesn't bring people that actually understand, relate and care about you into your life, then at least you have the satisfaction of being a better person and that no one can tell you you didn't try. Wish you the best, stay safe!"
