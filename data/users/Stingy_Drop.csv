depression,fdfrlm6,t1_fdfralh,1578368496.0,"I say I’m unattractive based off of what I’ve gotten from basically all the girls who I’ve talked to at my school, but yea I’m sure there’s someone out there who thinks the opposite. It’s just hard to be kept waiting while people around me are finding what I’ve been waiting so long for. And if it’s taken this long I can’t help but doubt that I’ll find someone. I’ll try my best to stay hopeful."
depression,fdfor5r,t3_ekx74l,1578366608.0,"I’m not a depressed person but I’m here so I can at least try to help whoever I can, even if their mind is already made up. If you’ve made up your mind and don’t want to hear my shit, you don’t have to read this, but I hope that you all do. 

I don’t understand what you’ve all gone through seeing as for the most part I’m mentally healthy and only 14, but I do know that I believe in god, as do some others here but probably not everyone. I believe that he is an author, who’s written countless stories and each one unfolds differently. Some stories are better than others, and based off what you’ve all said your story wasn’t a happy one. But my point is god will never write a story that is all bad, it’s up to us to make sure it’s not all bad. I can’t begin to comprehend how hard it is for some of the people here, but you have to try. Try for yourself, and for him up above, because all he wants is to see each and every one of us thrive."
