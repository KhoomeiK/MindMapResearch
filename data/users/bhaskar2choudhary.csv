About App -

So we always keep scrolling on Netflix, Prime etc. to choose a show and after 15-20 mins we end up watching same old show that, we know, won't disappoint. This app is an attempt to solve this.

\- App gives you personalized suggestion for 18 platforms including Netflix, prime, hotstar, jio

\- From there you add movies or tv series to your watchlist
