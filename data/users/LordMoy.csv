Marth could work great in FGO and Herc in Melee as a faster Ganondorf with better frame data would be sick"

arknights,ff3ez9z,t3_erdypb,1579539705.0,Can anyone translate what the characters say?
arknights,ff2he80,t3_er92hy,1579506225.0,I want Croissant KFC skin so bad lol. Need to roll her first though
GetMotivated,fewn35w,t1_fewkne3,1579415329.0,Pretty sure the clip isn't the full thing so...
arknights,fepty80,t1_fepsn9h,1579331183.0,"Yeah, I think the subreddit should start making rules about spoilers and stuff."
arknights,feptuaw,t3_eqd6ap,1579331075.0,"It's just part of her character, she talks fast when she's nervous. Her character files are really interesting btw!"
arknights,feporoe,t3_eqciwd,1579326348.0,"Yeah I feel this so much. One tap skips it, but one tap speeds it sometimes. Make up your mind game lol"
grandorder,fepd3o6,t3_eqatp3,1579317560.0,Someone who doesn't need bones probably
arknights,fep4vf8,t3_eq9goc,1579312181.0,Looks great!
arknights,fep4ksd,t3_eq9y8n,1579311993.0,I'd say so. It's a bit weak at first but CN players say it picks up in quality after Ch 3. It's the reason I picked up the game tbh. Even characters files and stuff are really good.
LoveLive,fem7kxz,t3_epukvj,1579242621.0,This looks so cool!
grandorder,fekfn6s,t3_epn1jc,1579199042.0,"I'm kinda mixed on it. There's times when it works great and I don't mind it a bit. As much as I loved the Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur stories growing up, I really like how Saber ended up being written and I don't really like Proto Arthur more than her. They're both great. But then you get Paul Bunyan which doesn't really do the legend justice one bit. And we probably won't get the ""real"" lumberjack ever in the game. So it works sometimes, sometimes doesn't."
arknights,fek76sw,t1_fek6z2s,1579194031.0,Legit there's been like 3 posts with this information already. These people need to just check for 3 seconds

arknights,feit052,t3_epdmy0,1579146434.0,"Great, also I believe that JP servers are up so if anyone wants to play it in Japanese, you could start playing right now."

grandorder,fei0cpf,t1_fehzfo3,1579127540.0,"Kinda, all but 1 of the 7 FE characters use only swords and the other uses sword and magic attacks. Then you have 3 Links and Hero which have a sword. 2 Pits, Cloud, Shulk makes a total of 15 sword characters I'm pretty sure."

grandorder,fefefc3,t3_enrpjw,1579054565.0,"If I hit the QP cap, will I still be able to open boxes and just not receive the QP? Like half of my servants need crystals and the other half need bones so I'm at a bit of an impasse."
grandorder,fecs96m,t3_eohbb0,1578982661.0,"Serenity because she's cute, she deserves it and she sorta implies wanting you to not be in a relationship with someone else at the end of her 2nd interlude. Plus her affection is more real at that point and not just ""you don't die so I love you""."
grandorder,fec4g9g,t1_fec3jrj,1578966509.0,"I understand that a lot of animation upgrades are tied to the events and whatnot. But the same caster balls and the same slash/jump for servants that could easily have something much more dynamic? It's just not fair for those 3 star and lower, Day 1, servants."
grandorder,febt2vg,t3_eobpnu,1578962358.0,Not with the main story side of things and events but more so the servants. Maybe DW not being proactive is the right phrase. We still have plenty of Day 1 servants that have garbage animations after all. Costumes are something that I think they aren't taking advantage of fully too.
arknights,febr81g,t3_eod2e0,1578961796.0,Yeah

grandorder,fckdg11,t3_ehm3cs,1577722850.0,"Finally have Summer Nobu (joined too late for Archer) and Serenity at 100! If it wasn't for everyone needing bones, they would be both 10/10/10. Now all I need is to roll MHXA and I'll have my three favorite/waifu servants. Don't know who I'll save up for next."
grandorder,fciptin,t1_fciow6d,1577666958.0,"From a purely game stand point it is. But if you like 4 or 5 stars, it'll be harder to enjoy since it's not guaranteed you'll get them."
grandorder,fcfukxr,t3_eh3khy,1577633857.0,"Looks great, glad I now have her at 100"
grandorder,fc9skbo,t3_egsipc,1577557581.0,"The way her toes are bent remind me too much of fingers, it's freaking me out a bit. Really good art though"
grandorder,fc9l242,t3_egss3b,1577554256.0,"There was some potential but it falls flat in my opinion. It's a bit more sexual in a way that doesn't do anything to improve the quality of the writing, seems only for fanservice. There are some cool parts but far and few."
arknights,fc6w5pp,t1_fc6vvcn,1577491045.0,"Alright, thanks so much for answering my questions! I am definitely looking forward to the global release even more now."
arknights,fc6u47d,t3_egia69,1577489545.0,"Since I unfortunately didn't make it into CBT for global, my questions might be dumb and answered through playing but oh well.

1. How often are there dead weeks and if there are, what do you do during them?

2. Do all units have a use or niche or are some just not good?

3. How good is the story, the backstory of the characters and the world building? 

4. Can you make standard content more difficult for yourself?"
gachagaming,fc6egh2,t1_fc6e303,1577478641.0,"I'll check it out, thanks for the suggestion!"
gachagaming,fc697ge,t3_eg6pzy,1577475176.0,"I'm looking for a side game, I currently play FGO and SIF. I have tried E7, AL, and GFL but quit after a few days of playing them for a few reasons. Not a fan of the gear mechanics in E7 and AL one bit. Not interested in a waifu(character) collector like AL and GFL, it just isn't interesting enough for me. 

A good story with great writing and interesting characters is my major criteria. Optional PVP, both male and female characters, and F2P friendly are a plus too. Nothing that needs heavy time commitment either."

arknights,fbzbs8a,t3_efaop8,1577241459.0,"That's good to hear! Personally the story is the main thing I'm looking forward to, basically a determining factor of whether I keep playing the game or not. Cute waifus aren't enough."
