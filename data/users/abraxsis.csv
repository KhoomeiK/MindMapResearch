While SDS is average guys who fully believe they are small, I also learned a lot about guys who actually are on the small side. There is a whole culture, that can even be found here on reddit, where guys get off on being humiliated/made fun of for having small penises. Not to mention a whole group of larger guys who go into those groups as ""Alphas"" to make fun of the ""Beta"" guys. 

The idea that people feel superior/inferior because of a genetic quirk that very few people ever see irl seems absolutely crazy to me.

AskReddit,fedeyzt,t1_fed989b,1579009684.0,"Also, just to add to this as someone who has lost a shit-ton of weight, your overall body size/shape vastly alters the perspective of what you see in the mirror or what other's see when you're naked.

I'll use myself as an example. When I was 400+lbs, not gonna lie, it was like a nub when flaccid, even though it was statistically above average erect. Now that I'm sub-200lbs it hangs no different than any other guy's and looks WAY bigger hard simply because the body around it is way smaller than before."
AskReddit,fededqo,t1_fecyzwn,1579009201.0,"Guys have, over the course of my lifetime, gotten to be horribly self-conscious about being seen naked and seeing other guys naked in places like locker rooms and changing rooms. When I was in Middle school showers were still required, but in High School was when they stopped. By the time I got to college it was about 50/50 in the dorms. Half were fine with showering/drying off in the open the other half were not. Now, 15 years after that, it's only the older guys who don't have a problem stripping down in the locker room.

It doesn't surprise me at all he didn't know cause he probably hadn't really seen another one in real life aside from big guys who didn't care and obviously porn.

There are studies (Id have to find them again) that loosely tie this reduction in people seeing others naked, even their own same-sex parents/siblings, to the huge jump in body image issues we see in the mental health world. People only see the ""perfect"" body image and the people who aren't shy about their body, which tend to be the people with perfect breasts, great figure/muscles, and/or a huge peen."

Many couldn't pass a basic drivers test even 2 months after getting their drivers license. Retesting should be part of every license renewal. I have to do continuing education to maintain a professional license, but people are allowed to study for 2 weeks at 16 years old and get a license for life to drive something that can kill.

I also feel anyone who seems to have had a hand in the situation, Nunes for instance, should also recuse from any aspect of the investigation since he is, technically, voting for his own self-interests if he was involved.

I'm Independent, I'm not one sided on this situation. Personally, what Trump did was HIGHLY unethical. A sitting US president used his power to investigate a citizen in a foreign country without any real reasoning aside from who his father was. Trump can say that Hunter Biden wasn't qualified for the position he was in as the reason for investigating. But, he's one to talk since members of his family (some also unqualified for the positions) are where they are due to who they're related to. Up to, and including, working in the White House.

As much as I personally despise Trump as a leader, I feel like they should have just censured him and moved on. This sets the future precedence that what Trump did is illegal. However, that would never happen because you'd need to get the Democrats to look weak to their voters for giving in and the you'd need the Republicans to admit what their man did was wrong and unethical (and face his childish backlash via twitter). Frankly, with so many people scared of what a single man types in his twitter feed in the middle of the night, that alone shows me that checks and balances are losing to social standing, money and ""feels."""

AskReddit,fcuhq31,t1_fct0ski,1577981233.0,"> Having a compatible sexual partner is a great thing. But if we’d have been incompatible, for whatever reason, I like to think we’d still be married because we didn’t put sex on a higher pedestal than it deserved at the earliest stage of our relationship.

Just a point of logic here. But you don't actually know if you're compatible since you have no frame of reference outside of the relationship you are in. It is like saying that someone who has been raised in a single room isn't compatible with the rest of the world at large. Then when they get out of the room, they never go outside the house. They're happy, because it is vastly more than they had. But from an outside perspective, it's still nowhere near what they might have access too. You're only SATISFIED, sexually, within your realm of understanding and experience. You have, in essence, manufactured your compatibility, forced it even, versus learning if you are truly compatible.

>Waiting is an act of selflessness. It’s a demonstration that we highly value the person we want to spend the rest of our lives with.

No, waiting is an act of instilled obedience. Humans only reframe their beliefs into this kind of altruistic structure so they can live with them better. They reframe ""I can't do this because I don't believe it's okay"" into ""I'm doing this for a higher purpose that's beyond me, LOOK, I am suffering to make the marriage better."" That's just ego and sexual frustration talking IMO.
