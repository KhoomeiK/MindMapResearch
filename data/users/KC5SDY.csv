AskReddit,fdi2cyr,t3_elhk95,1578434495.0,"Basic training - After one of our road marches, I was one of two privates that were assisting our Drill Sergeants checking in everyone's rifles. We were only allowed to carry blanks. I would grab a rifle, hand it to our DS, he would reach over and check to see if it was charged and pull the trigger. When he was satisfied, he would hand it over to the other private and he would hand it to the armorer. Someone left a blank in the chamber. It went off, blew a hole in my DS's BDU's. The DS looked up at me, we both had a shocked look on our faces. I asked him if he was ok. He looked down at his stomach, checked the size of the hole and looked for any injuries. He told me he was ok but someone was about to die. He looked down at the rifle number and asked the armorer who's it was. The armorer replied with who it belonged to and my DS told both of us to come with him. We set the rifles down and followed. I have never seen a more intense grass drill session in my life. This was a session to beat all other sessions. 

AIT - It was not 1 person but, a visiting company. We were marching to chow. Along both sides of the ""parking lot"" to the chow hall were portable barracks. Those barracks were housed by visiting marines. They heard us coming and decided to come out and harass us. Just before any fights broke out, a DS heard the commotion and smoked the marines. That was the 2nd hardest grass drill session I had ever seen.

Duty Station - I was a helicopter mechanic. I worked on the UH-1 Huey, the CH-47 Chinook, and the OH-58 Iroquois's that my unit had. My job would have me working on the tail rotors and main rotors of those birds. The tail rotor on a CH-47 is up very high. There is a door that folds down as a platform to stand on. I was walking up to assist another private when a notorious butthead was blabbering about how he knows everything as he started to walk under one of those tail rotor platforms. Just before he does, a wrench ""accidentally"" fell from the platform above him and nearly hit him. I honestly have no idea what happened as a result. The butthead quieted down a lot. I don't know if anything happened the private on the platform."
