SelfAwarewolves,ffeb8mt,t1_ffcirqv,1579841929.0,"But how would you court a guy you wanted to become friends with? Instead of leaping into 'omg, you're so beautiful' how about 'you seem pretty cool - mind if I text you?' You get a yes to text, you text a bit, show off your witty skills, she texting you back might indicate some interest, then propose meeting up for some activity - a date, like. She don't text you back, or doesn't want to meet up, then you know your interest isn't reciprocated."

SelfAwarewolves,ffe9ob4,t1_ffdjkib,1579840559.0,"I really hate when people notice changes in my appearance. I find it agonizing. Social anxiety and all that - and while it may not be the most common thing, I can't be alone. Now, I've been around long enough to know how to smile and graciously accept compliments in the spirit they were given. That fake-polite-happiness. But secretly, I still mostly hate that they noticed. I genuinely appreciate the sentiment behind it though. So push on with sincere compliments and don't social-anxiety yourself into reading too much into someone's reaction, provided you aren't generally coming off as too pushy or familiar with others."

We can only really judge someone by their behaviors - we're not in their heads. So if the behaviors improve because that's what it takes to have a successful relationship? Count it as a win and take it."
