Unless you mean IRL theoretically. Then still glad, bc the trident has a ton more range and even tho his buckler (small shield) isnt that great and defense, its better than no shield."

I mean, I get very little sleep as well, but I know its my own damn fault bc i stay up watching yt vids. And i bet that most people in highschool or lower just complain about this, when in reality, if they wouldnt procrastinate so damn much all the time they could likely get it done easily.
Also, for people complaing about how its bc school starts so early... Then go to sleep earlier, I dont see a problem here..."
