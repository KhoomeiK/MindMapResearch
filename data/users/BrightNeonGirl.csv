florida,fev5189,t1_feugv8e,1579393182.0,"I think a big part of one's opinion on FL and the PNW is one's heat preferences. Never have I ever before living here met so many people that are miserable above 75 degree temps. I didn't realize people could feel negatively about that since to me getting below 75 is when I get cold. So it's like Pacific North-Westerners' optimum temperature range is like 15-20 degrees shifted down from mine (and, as I would imagine, other Florida lovers' preferred range as well). And of course people here seem to really dig mountains. Like, it all makes sense since the PNW is known for the Cascades and the Olympics. I just randomly happened to be here and am stuck for a little while longer and then I'll head back home.

We need to advocate for more trade schools instead of sending kids to college for 4 year degrees with no concrete plan for a career or how to pay off any debt. College interest should also be low, like mortgage level low.
