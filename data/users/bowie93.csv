cyberpunkgame,feklc2j,t1_fekeepg,1579202435.0,The latter most likely. But again it was understandable back then. I just hope they make it right and add proper mod support at least.
cyberpunkgame,feke54o,t1_fekdlus,1579198155.0,"It did, for me and some others at least. Quest were broken. There's was a bug with the triss romance. Endless loading screens, some save files were deleted. Frame drops. The wolf armor treasure hunt was bugged too. There's still a bug with swimming (diving key wont work) so you have to close and open again. There are still broken side quests too (the mage guy in novigrad will be invisible) and so on..."
BattlefieldV,fekcguj,t1_fek8zzn,1579197158.0,Specially brushing the dust off part. Cringe.
cyberpunkgame,fekc7eh,t3_epmh8o,1579197001.0,"Saw it from a mile away. The last gameplay was probably cut for bug reasons anyway (according to yong yea) To be honest, after the witcher 3 buggy launch (i love the game but it was buggy as hell) its understandable."
pcgaming,fehkkfn,t3_ep1zl2,1579118431.0,Never played it. Is it really that good?
SandersForPresident,feh041e,t1_fegwwic,1579106340.0,The senate will decide your fate.
depression,fedvi4e,t3_eomy2w,1579020770.0,"It really doesnt. I think only one of my posts here has had a reply. But at the end of the day, this is not a place to look for help imo. Seek either group or individual therapy.  

If I depended on this sub alone i would've give up by now. But at the end of the day I understand. People here struggle too, if they give attention to a post just saying fuck then, its their choice and its fine."
PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fdqxr5z,t1_fdqmgqj,1578676335.0,Imposible. Perhaps the archives are incomplete
BattlefieldV,fczagsc,t1_fcz85a9,1578096966.0,I live in mexico and naturally i play on NA servers. But for some reason most of the games on the browser are at orange ping. Today they were a few on green but ran horribly though. Not sure what the issue is. Other multiplayer games rub fine
BattlefieldV,fcza55g,t1_fcz0mdg,1578096770.0,"Server browser. I even put in filters NA. But the best ping has been 98 and it runs mych worse (around 200+) the yellow ones (ping at 116-120) run absolutly terrible around 300 +. 

I dont understand. I run pubg, halo perfectly on NA servers."
pcgaming,fckczo2,t1_fck43p1,1577722560.0,How is it on the technical aspect? Read some steam reviews and it sounds like there are still some big issues.
pcmasterrace,fcg7uib,t3_egyd5y,1577637328.0,So far think I've seen the same post around 7 times now.
metro,fc63a62,t3_egd3df,1577471293.0,I managed to pull steady 60 with and rtx2060 and core i5  at 1080 think you'll be just fine.
witcher,fc2xa4f,t3_efu27z,1577376483.0,They had on the first half not gonna lie
buildapc,fc2tizs,t1_fc2stnd,1577373610.0,Damn. Guess I'll have to save a bit a get another one. Was under the impresion it was due to the motherboard since its as cheap as it gets.
buildapc,fc2tdo5,t1_fc2sw5y,1577373488.0,"Typo , sorry.  Any cpu you would recommend instead?"
witcher,fby28lf,t1_fbxxw50,1577206328.0,"Sorry but no. Some quest do stay open, some others will be shown as failed after geralt goes to the isle of mist. Dandelions quest for instance will be failed, the bloody barons ending quest will be failed too. Some random quest will only appesr after certain events and won't appear again after you reach certain point in the game."
witcher,fbxmwdo,t1_fbxm35z,1577194335.0,"No disrespect intended here but isn't genetics a huge factor in all of this? I for instance, managed to put in some muscle but the guy that I train with was very clrear on setting up my goals in that there's no way for me the achieve said for example Chris Hermsworth arms or whatever."
HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fbwog62,t3_eeg1uq,1577155225.0,Oh fuck you lord azriel.
depression,fbwctz1,t3_eeqzyz,1577146556.0,Almost all the time. I find it interesting though. Is my mind so fucked up and self centered in a echo chamber of dispair that I'm imagining things?
PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fbv2ldw,t3_eehm2t,1577124378.0,"I use voicemeter banana. So far I haven't had any issue. The only thing that I would aware you off is gun shots sounds. They're lower so you might be listening someone that's really not that far away. But since you're able to tweak how much sound compresion you want, you can adjust it to your preference"
witcher,fbuyssa,t3_eemrql,1577122580.0,I remember on my 3/4th playthrough trying to beat sasha with a monster deck. Ended up giving up and loading a file prior to the game with her
witcher,fbuq839,t3_eem2yz,1577118618.0,Man henry is so fucking huge. Like the dude is the epitome of testosterone holy shit
pcmasterrace,fbupykm,t3_eelson,1577118501.0,I prefer the flat one tbh. I even use a mod for that lol. But that's just my preference
witcher,fbu7bnh,t1_fbu4nhf,1577109143.0,F
witcher,fbt0cw1,t1_fbsz4e3,1577064955.0,She is
witcher,fbrx97j,t1_fbrt0uo,1577047364.0,Amen.
witcher,fbrwfla,t3_ee4i2i,1577047062.0,"Meh. 

That's all I will say. Im glad there's an adaptation that could bring in more fans to explore either games or books. After watching the season and rewatching some episodes I feel Henry delivers. But that's it. 

Im happy this whole thing is bringing more attention to the universe I love, but if someone were to ask me if this is a good place to start getting into the universe I would say no. Major improvements could be done and dear god I hope they improve for the next season."
witcher,fblv4gz,t1_fbluohr,1576971087.0,"I know! It was soooo bad! Like they should've just copied the eragon movie dragon design and make it gold. It was that simple. 

I really try to liked that episode along with the battle but man they dropped the ball hard on those two."
witcher,fblujds,t1_fblsf1g,1576970648.0,I thought it was just me lol. I imagined the whole sodden hill thing diferent. My biggest complain tho: the gold dragon. Who the fuck design that thing ? Who thought that was a good idea?
pokemon,fbdkigx,t3_ecra1w,1576764748.0,Rip my favorite mega evolution.
HisDarkMaterialsHBO,fb7odqg,t3_ebvm3h,1576595540.0,"Non book reader so take it with a grain of salt. I honestly was interested in this guy story. Where is Wills father and if there's something interesting in the letters. However, his ark is is going so slowly. Layra went north, got kidnapped, destroyed the facility, balloon, fall, bear palace, bear trickery, bear fight while on Wills world they've established the letters and spying , letters important bla bla , mom freaking out. 

I think the story is interesting but slow af. It was not until last ep when something actually happened. It kinda reminds me of the casino planet on the last jedi except Wills ark has to lead somewhere and he is actually important. 

Overall these segments could've been done better. Maybe is just me here but I rather have a full episode focusing on him, will/his mom showing something meaninful instead of editing his story on top of layra. But hey, that's just my opinion."
