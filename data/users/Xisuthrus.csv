Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,

Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:

And on the pedestal these words appear:

'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:

Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare

They don't.

> Not only did they almost all got exterminated

Its a common fantasy trope, starting with Tolkien, that the elves are ""older"" than humanity somehow and are declining in power and influence over time. That's why there's so many extinct elven precursor races, not any hatred of them.

> even if mens commited genocides it is ""justified"" by the Lore

Elven genocide is not justified by the out-of-universe writers. The in-universe writers who wrote about Pelinal or the Marukhati massacring elves view their actions as justified, because said in-universe ancient writers are racist.

>  it is ""justified"" by the Lore (mostly writtend by mens by the way)

I'm pretty sure all of the lore is written by men. (and women) Elves aren't real.

> The Lefthanded elves have no lore, nothing, we just know that the Good Redguards killed the evil elves

The only existing sources on the Yokudan/Lefthander conflict were written by the Yokudans themselves. Of course they would present themselves as good and their enemies as evil.

> The Ayleid used humans as slaves, yes most of them were evils but I don't see how the Empire can still be good after killing civilians and betraying their allies (the good Ayleids who didn't used slaves and helped the mens in their revolt). They tried to killed all the good Ayleids once they won and forced them to flee but they are humans so we can forgive them

The Ayleid slavers were monstrous. The Alessians massacring them and driving them out of Cyrodiil was also monstrous. However, the modern Mede Empire is not the same thing as the Alessian Empire. Different people, different dynasty, even different gods.

> The Dunmers are in the brink of extinction. The eruption of Red Moutain, the Daedra invasion and the invasion of the argonians (not much but still something) destroyed them forever, Morrowind will never be great again

The Nerevarine, a Padomaic being in the tradition of Veloth and Lorkhan, shook up the decaying status quo of Morrowind in a violent and sudden way. The Morrowind-that-was was destroyed to create the Morrowind-that-is, something new and different. I don't see how this is evidence of Bethesda hating elves.

> The altmers will lose to the empire since the whole community want it, the fact that they are portrayed as all evils because Bethesda couldn't make a complex story with complex and realistic factions, evil and lesser evil for example. They will be exctinct as well

The Thalmor will be defeated. The Thalmor are evil. The Altmer are not the Thalmor, and many of them oppose their insane elf-Nazi overlords.

> The snow elves now the one who got the worst. First I don't buy the Nord story, too many plotholes

You shouldn't buy any one-sided story in the Elder Scrolls. Everybody's pushing propaganda.

> How can 500 peoples invade a country the size of skyrim? They would need thousands of mens to do it

There were much more than 500 Nords living in Skyrim already. The 500 Companions were probably just the first and greatest of them to answer Ysgramor's call to arms. Also, an ambiguous but nonzero percentage of the Companions were much more powerful than your average mortal human.

> a 9 years old girl throw a sword and pierce and armor... They tried to glorified an event by exagerating it

I'm not familiar with the event you're referring to, but yes, you shouldn't expect a skald to let the truth get in the way of telling a good story.

> Gelebor, a priest who seem neutral, say that the Nord started to invade them directly so Saarthal could be a destroyed outpost in the middle of an already started war

Certainly possible.

> The Nords started to invade Morrowind and High Rock for no reason after they took skyrim

Yep. The ancient Nords, and to a lesser extent their modern descendants, are a violent people who tend to be racist against elves. This says nothing about Bethesda themselves.

> So the Snow elves might or might not have destroyed a settlement for no reasons but the Nords killing all the snow elves is totally justified.

Nobody said that.

> In the mean times humans did countless of massacres or genocides but never paid for it

I can count two, perhaps three - The Nedes killing the Ayleids, the Yokudans killing the Left-Handed elves, and the Nords killing the Falmer. In regards to the third one, its possible that the Nords mostly just drove the Falmer from the surface, (Not a great thing to do in of itself, admittedly) and the Dwemer were actually the ones doing most of the dirty work.

Also, while they haven't ""paid for"" anything, you can't say Elder Scrolls humanity's history is without suffering. The Direnni used Bretons and Reachmen as sex slaves. The Ayleids turned humans into ""flesh-gardens"" and hunted them for sport. Even if it was part of an already ongoing war, the Falmer clearly *did* massacre the inhabitants of Saarthal.

Overall, you've posted a bunch of examples of elves being cruel to humans, and claimed that it's evidence that the writers think elves are evil and therefore hate elves, and also a bunch of examples of humans being cruel to elves, and claimed that it's evidence that the writers like seeing elves suffer and therefore hate elves.

If I had to guess, I think the idea is that Vivec views Lorkhan's living self (Lorkhan) and Lorkhan's undead self (Shor) as separate beings, with the former being good and the latter bad.

Additionally, the book ""Sithis"" was written either by Vivec or someone who likes Vivec's philosophy, since it refers to Dagoth Ur as the Sharmat.

teslore,ff9bbbc,t1_ff8zjae,1579709061.0,"My theory on the retcons is that the writers were worried about returning players from Oblivion being confused due to the Nordic pantheon being so similar to the Nine Divines and yet at the same time vastly different, and specifically not understanding why Akatosh (as Alduin) was suddenly a villain after being an important force for good in the last game. (Similarly, the way the intro to the game seems to encourage you to side with the Stormcloaks may have been an attempt to counteract the pro-Imperial bias Oblivion players would obviously have.)

The thing is, Skyrim massively eclipsed its predecessor in popularity (like pretty much every main series game did) so the whole thing became a sort of non-issue, and thus they've tried to walk back the retcons a bit. 

Ultimately, although I like the realism of a single theological sticking point getting associated with different sides of a cultural/ideological divide and igniting a civil war, (cf. the Troubles.)
