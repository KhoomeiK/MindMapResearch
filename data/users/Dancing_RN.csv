I'm a medical professional so I know how much stigma there still is.  And I'm lucky I had people personally and professionally who supported me through the decision to go through the treatment.

MadOver30,ff1r62v,t3_er56i0,1579484373.0,"FWIW, we are of similar age and background experience. 

You should consider laying off substances for the thrill of them and lay off the risky behaviors for an extended period...at least 6 months. During that period seek out new things that interest you...dance, painting very tiny landscapes,  singing...anything that doesnt give a quick reward center rush, but a slower one from learning a new thing. 

I'm recommending this because, put very simply,  when our brains are addicted to the dopamine rush, it takes a while to build up new pathways to pleasure. You just have to be willing to give it some time.  And I'm not suggesting you quit everything cold Turkey, keep the vape, for example. 


I quit smoking a little over a year ago, and I quit alcohol a little over four months ago. I am just in the last few weeks or so starting to have just neutral feelings instead of anxiety or irritation.

I know theres a longitudinal study where I live (it's been going for at least 15 years) and I feel like there are probably dupes in and near other biggish cities. The one I participated in provided free medication/patches/lozenges and counseling. 


IIRC, the most effective combo so far is medication (either bupropion  or chantix) and lozenges for break through cravings. I'm over a year smoke-free now (after smoking for ~26 years), after who-only-knows-how-many attempts. You can do it!!"
