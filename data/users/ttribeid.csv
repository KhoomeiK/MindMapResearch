Just as you, an atheist, would not want a christian paramedic to impose his beliefs on you at the time of your dying, so you did not impose your beliefs, but honored his.  Working in hospice we are often in this position.  It is amazing how much love we are capable to giving if we begin with respect.  

As to baptism, the first christian baptism was Jesus himself by John the Baptist.  John was not a priest, rather a bit of a renegade.  Even in church baptism today, while the priest is responsible for it, theologically there is not a priest who is perfect and sinless enough to perform one.  We accept that in these instances God's spirit sanctifies the process and what is important is the mind and heart of the one being baptized.  

You gave peace to a dying man.  For that you are to be commended.  Thank you for being a decent human being."

askgaybros,feypwhb,t3_eqxcvx,1579449013.0,"How long does it take you to fall in love?  It is easy for us to want love so much that we are willing to see it far before we should, almost to the point where the other person doesn't matter.  

Early in a relationship most people are showing you the best version of themselves.  It takes lots of time for this facade to break down and for you to see the right person.  Sex can confuse the process too as having sex causes your mind to release chemicals that make you think you love your partner.  So remember to expect this after sex, and stop and think if you really have known this person long enough or well enough to truly love them.

When we see someone early on and are attracted to them, that is not love, it is desire.  Love is a decision we make to commit.  If the person you think you love was a middle age, overweight and ugly guy, would you have the same feeling?  Ultimately with real love you will see that person at their most unattractive, including watching as they grow older, with all that entails.  Don't confuse desire for love.

Don't enter relationships or dates expecting to find love.  When you date anticipate it as a way to meet someone more as a friend, to discover who they are and what makes them tic.  Put.them in your mind into a friend with benefits category, and don't think about love until you have seen each other enough to know who they are without the mask.

Finally, nothing repulses people, especially guys, like the appearance of desperation.  And if you are talking about love, life partners, the ""one"", or marriage during the first 5 dates, it is received as desperation.  Would you expect another person to know all about you as a person after one or two dates or hook ups?  

When true love comes let it surprise you.  Until then, just be friends."

This goes far beyond understanding what label belongs to us to include many truly intimate details about how we express ourselves sexually.  Social and family expectations can help us with this or make it almost impossible to fully understand and accept.  For most, as we mature and change, it is a lifetime of discovery.

Your friend may be gay or bi and hasn't arrived at a place where he can accept that part of himself yet.  I found guys attractive long before I was comfortable describing myself as gay.  He could also be straight.  Have patience, let him know you will accept him no matter what he identifies as, and that his secrets are safe with you.  Give him in your friendship a place where he can be free and accepted.  In time he may come out, or he may realize that all flirtations aside he really is straight.

Your mother still loves you, as you still love her.  It will take time and patience for her to accept these aspects of you, and she may never fully do so.  Treat her with respect and patience, and make it clear she needs to treat you with respect.  

She will have questions for you.  As long as you can talk politely together answer them and talk things out.  There are many books by different people about why traditional anti gay bible verses are not so, for example books by Mathew Vines.  Let her read some and talk about them.  If things get too heated then remind her you love her but you will not accept disrespect.

Without serfs, merchants and assorted tradesmen the lord would be quite poor and would eventually lose the land for a lord who could make money from the land.  The quality of serfs, land cultivated, mines, towns, trades, harbors and land available for herding animals all had a direct impact on the wealth and success of the Lord.  

Many Lords took a paternal attitude to their serfs, rewarding those who produced, punishing those who didn't or who caused trouble.  There were laws limiting how mobile a serf could be, but in times of labor shortage like during plagues the Lords would try to keep their own serfs while turning a blind eye if the neighboring Lord's serfs decided to steal to his own land.  

The southwest had been raided by Danes, French, Irish and the Welsh amongst others, as well as by other Lords.  Serfs not protected could be killed or enslaved by raiders, so having cities and castles to protect your more valuable serfs could protect your profit margin.
