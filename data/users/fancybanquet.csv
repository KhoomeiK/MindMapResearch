Do this four more times. 

It's going to be okay. Everything is going to be okay. 

Give yourself permission to feel what you are feeling, do not judge yourself for your thoughts. Close your eyes and watch them pass for a minute. Let them run wild but don't engage, just observe them. 

You are going through a really tough time right now. Things are hard, but it will be okay. Sometimes when things are hard we do things that aren't healthy or good for us, but reaching out is a big step that some people aren't able to do, but you did that! Give yourself some praise and credit that you did something that was really hard!

Remember it's 1000% okay to cry. Cry as often as you need to. Crying is normal and healthy. Remember to drink water so you don't get dehydrated, or some tea even. A warm drink can be very relaxing. 

You will make it through this, just take it one day at a time and pause every now and then to take a second to just breathe."

First of all, eating less than your usual 5000 calorie dinner IS NOT an eating disorder. 

Second, eating WITHIN THE RECOMMENDED NUTRITIONAL GUIDELINES OF A 2000 DIET IS NOT AN EATING DISORDER

Choosing to have a salad instead of a steak IS NOT AN EATING DISORDER

Dropping a few pounds by cutting out soda, fast food, fried food, chips, candy, dairy, frozen food... is? You guessed it. NOT an eating disorder! It's actually called EATING LIKE AN ADULT 

And you know what ELSE isn't an eating disorder? DISORDERED EATING

Just because you have a difficult relationship with food DOES NOT mean you have a fucking eating disorder. 

You can have and display signs of disordered eating WITHOUT necessarily having a full blown eating disorder. 

You know what an eating disorder IS? 

Something that consumes your life, damages your relationships with friends and family, permanently changes the way you view yourself and the way you view food, something that consumes so much of your day you are driving yourself sick and to death. 

I'm just so sick of all this talk like just because you skipped breakfast does not mean you have an eating disorder and it's unfair and disrespectful to the people and families of people who actually struggle with real eating disorders to say, wow, you lost 15 pounds, you obviously are anorexic now.

But I live in CO now where *everyone* hikes and while we don't have as many overweight people, the people in the gym are not as fully fit as people in CA, and it's not the only place fit people hang out, a lot of fit people like to hike and when you actually see who's hiking they are all different sizes, and someone you might think is slightly overweight could still probably out-hike you by at least 5 miles. 

IMO I think the culture around fitness is a lot more inviting out here as well since people genuinely seem to enjoy hiking and are always trying to find new hiking friends and get people into hiking, whereas in in CA (in the valley) my experience has been, hiking people are very competitive and if you can't keep up they don't want to be friends with you."

I was just talking to a friend last night, who is from Europe, about how the US has such a weird relationship with food. In the US we have so much processed food, and processed food is a part of our culture, with big chain restaurants that cultivate a ""part of your family"" vibe, restaurants that serve ridiculous portion sizes, every holiday being a chance to binge eat gigantic meals with desserts and candies, and snacks snacks snacks galore. Traditional American food is packed with sugar and oil and carbs. She said one thing that surprised her when she came here is how many different types of bread we have, and that a lot of the bread we eat has sugar in it for no reason. 

So while the theory of this is true, until the US as a country reevaluates it's relationship with food, it's not gonna be fully true for us. Like, damn, I crave McDonald's every other day. I'm not gonna go to McDonald's every time I crave it, that's ridiculous."

But people aren't owed each other loyalty, honor or kindness, and it sucks to realize this, but it's just the way the world works. All you can do is hope in the future you will find someone who is able to communicate better, and who loves you enough to try to work on things before ending them.

BreakUps,fegdrym,t3_eoxqbk,1579089146.0,"I think this is true in some cases but I also think in a lot of cases there is responsibility that falls on both people. 

Sure if the other person cheats on you, it most likely wasn't your fault. But unless the person just never cared about you in the first place, if they cheated, there was already something wrong in the relationship. 

I personally feel like someone who can't acknowledge what they did wrong in a relationship is refusing to grow as an individual. Perhaps you were toxic and you didn't realize it because no one's ever called you out on your shit before. Perhaps there was something you neglected, and you didn't realize how much it was affecting them until it was too late. Maybe you guys just didn't get along, and that's okay, but it's no one's fault. And maybe they wanted to grow into a different person and they didn't feel like you'd be willing/interested/accepting of heading down that path together.

There was one ex who was very toxic and treated me very poorly, but for so long I was obsessed with him.

It was very confusing. 

Learning about rOCD has freed me a lot from the weight of questioning myself constantly. I understand now that it is an obsessive compulsive disorder and my thoughts aren't necessarily my own.

BreakUps,fe1n24g,t3_enm6ve,1578828586.0,"Okay but I just got broken up with recent as well. Almost immediately I downloaded tinder. Sure I'm talking to guys, sure I'm going on casual dates, but that doesn't mean I want anything serious. 

All of my breakups I waited until the guys started talking to other girls before I gave myself permission to start talking to other guys. I'm not doing that this time. Yes, I'm also trying to work on myself, but I can't do that 24/7 and in the times I'm not, I would like to talk to other guys, and there is nothing wrong with that. And I'm not gonna feel guilty about talking to new guys and going on casual dates because we broke up and I don't owe him my time, my personal development, or some warped sense of loyalty to a relationship that is now over."
DeadBedrooms,fdpzl22,t3_emncpd,1578647497.0,"As a LL the reason I masturbated instead of having sex was that it was easier, quicker, and was over usually in a few minutes or less. But I also didn't have a porn problem or anything where id spend hours watching it. Sex was very emotionally exausting, the cleanup took too long, the whole process of it took too long, and once my ex and I realized sex was an actual problem, it became intimidating to bring anything about it up when all I needed to do was just have a very quick and simple orgasm. But I'm also a woman so there was also a decent amount of time and focus involved in me even getting good for sex without it being painful during and after."
tarot,fdjj3dy,t3_ei9v0t,1578473149.0,"I found this post because I was looking up if decks have personalities because of what just happened to me lol bear with me as I try to explain. 

I'm going through a breakup, plus still not over some ex's, so after doing some other readings on other relationships in my life, I asked it to tell me about my love life past present and future (I'm still a beginner so kind of a broad, easy, cliche topic) 

I can't remember the exact cards, but past was ""imagination"" meaning to me when I was younger, I looked at love immaturely, honestly true lol. Present was ""guarded"" meaning to me I'm guarding my heart, accurate. Future was something like ""maturity, evaluation"" and I thought, okay that makes sense. 

But honestly it wasn't what I was asking, and I know it knew that, so I was like, okay be real though, will I reconnect with an ex? Is love for me in the past or with this guy now, or in the future. 

I basically got cards that definitively said no, no, and then a card that said ""like I told you, be mature and critical in the future"" 

So I was like, please explain, will I meet my dream guy in the future, and pulled a second card and I pulled the fool! 

Like I know the fool doesnt really mean literally, fool, but in that moment it felt like a straight diss. Like the deck was trying to tell me, ""hey I already gave you advice about this stop thinking like idiot"" and I was like, geez okay I get it.

It was the first time I'd seen a sense of humor from this deck. I've had it for a little while (it's my first and only deck so far) but have been using it more. For the most part most of what I pull really resonates with me and is on point and straight forward so I'm starting to trust it. But as insulted as I felt, I also thought it was funny, and it made me happy because I always hear people talk about ""find a deck you connect with"" and didn't really get it until just now."
EDAnonymous,fdgcnrw,t3_el4nca,1578390322.0,"If it makes any sense, my cheekbones and neck get pretty gaunt pretty quickly. Yet my actual cheeks stay the same, but because of the contrast, they end up looking bigger. 

And then of course there are my thighs which also slim down quickly, yet my hips and stomach stay the same. Then I feel like I just look like a box shape. 

But I think my cheekbones are the most obvious and also pretty much how my parents can tell I'm not doing well."
