onguardforthee,fcqf3rq,t1_fcp05d9,1577884778.0,"TL:DR: Know some basic things about Canadian law when you try to bring your case to the Supreme Court.


Yah, sure.

So, I would like to start by saying that the cannabis movement that started in the 2000's in major cities across Canada has been successful. Many advocates put in a lot of hard work and made, mostly, positive changes. 

In general, I think the average person has a better understanding of cannabis now than before.

I thank those people. Many have died from serious illnesses while fighting.

What I meant when I said those who have fought in court weren't successful in the traditional sense (winning your case) because of how they worded their argument. 

In R vs Mernagh, a sick man could not find legal access to cannabis, despite there being a government program, because doctors were/are the gatekeepers and (most) don't want to be seen as 'pot' doctors (due to a lack of medical evidence and meta analyses). 

So, when the sick dude was arrested and put through the courts, he successfully appealed the decisions all the way up to the federal court. They chose not to listen to his case but didn't punish the sick man.

Why didn't the federal court decide to hear the case? 

A few reasons. 

First, the Supreme Court of Canada was dealing with some real issues. Yes, the case was a 'real' issue but compared to the Assisted Death case, plus the other cases, it was small game. 

Second, their argument was that even though the government had a medical cannabis program (or several, since it has changed a lot over the years) the fact that sick people have such a hard time accessing it is unconstitutional. 

While this going on, the government makes more adjustments to the program, then scraps the program and puts in a new one. The new program is now, technically, easier but (in true government fashion) the gov' was slow to provide cannabis for their cannabis program. Either having none at all, like in the first few years of the new program, or not having enough. 

So, a new access problem.

The sick man and his lawyer decided that the best way to approach said problem is to say that access to (medical) cannabis was a Canadian right. For the average Canadian, that might sound like a great argument. You know, sick people are told to try every single drug available to them before cannabis. Often times people know cannabis works for them but they are forced onto opioids and lots of terrible drugs first. Why not say that cannabis as medicine is my right? Right? Wrong.

Why is the premise of their argument faulty? Access to cannabis, even for medical purposes, is not a Canadian or human right. Its just not. If cannabis was a right, Canada would have to ensure that every single Canadian has cannabis or else it is failing as a country.

Lets look at water. Water is a human right. Canada and many other countries have signed international declarations stating this to be true. The thing is, water as a right hasn't been written into the Canadian constitution. First, it doesn't fit nicely into the spirit of the constitution (if you look, its a bunch of statements outlining what people cannot do to you). Second, if Canada did incorporate water as a human right and didn't fix the water access issue across the country then it is seen as a failing country and would have consequences to face. So, Canada hasn't adopted water as a human right within our own documents, just as an international promise.

This is why access to medical cannabis is not a  right. Well, there's a ton of other reasons but for our sake, let's just stick to this.

With that all being said, I was wishing the medical psychedelics people good luck but also cautioning them. Word your arguments carefully, choose your lawyer carefully, and educate the public.

books,fcge4vq,t3_egyz63,1577639044.0,"Toronto, here. There are a few great specialty books stores that I love and support.

The SciFi store on Harbord and Spadina or the African/Caribbean/Indigenous store on Bathurst near Bloor. 

For classics, I will check out all the used book stores or that giant BMV. 

As far as Chapters Indigo goes, I think they are similar enough to the evils of Amazon. Plus, they are more expensive. 

Used books from Amazon isn't ethical but its a bit better than some other options, if my local stores don't have what I am looking for."
