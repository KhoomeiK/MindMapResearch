photographs,fdfmxb5,t1_fdfjig3,1578365404.0,"I did try to focus the eye with single point focus. But the gear was a little heavy for me and it was my first time. And tracking at 600m was a little difficult. Hopefully it gets better with practice.

That's my problem. I mess up the composition. That's my problem since the beginning. I'll follow your advice next time. And it's fine, I just wanted to know my mistakes.

Anyways thanks for your time :D"
photographs,fdeodg3,t3_ekztuu,1578343254.0,"I've been trying bird photography recently. Rented a Tamron 150-600mm G2. Went to Vedanthangal bird sanctuary which is almost 100kms from my place. I was lucky to see lot of birds. I saw this Spot-Billed Pelican swimming calmly. Since it's my first time with big lenses it was a little difficult to track subject. Do comment your views. Critique it so that I can improve next time.
