dontflinch,fexptli,t1_fev2ita,1579434580.0,I expected the unexpected because the title says unexpected. But what happened is something expected which is not what I expected because I expected the unexpected. So i guess it is kinda unexpected??
introvert,fexf6m1,t1_fewviq9,1579430002.0,"Yeah man totally, when you are both introvert and anti-social, you are anti-social, I guess.. *shrug*

Joke aside, being an Introvert is perfectly okay, but when you also lack empathy of others I suggest you to get a counseling or meet a psychiatrist. At least it's good that you acknowledge it."

socialanxiety,feldrfl,t1_fekwvwi,1579219794.0,"Unless when you have social anxiety. Everytime you go to any social gathering the anxiety is so unbearable you just wish to die or just vanish in an instant. And almost every day you think of suicide because you hate living with social anxiety. 

I can't connect to people, I can't connect to friends, I can't even connect to my family. I don't see any reason to live if I can't connect to somebody. 

But there's still a lot of things I wanted to see and experience. This thought is probably what keeps me from suicide. I do think life is precious, I just hate living like this. 

Sorry I just need to get this out of my head."

socialanxiety,fd0ppmk,t3_ejli0x,1578122094.0,I have this habits of starting the talk first because I feel bad for being silent. The anxiety of being found out I'm having SA force me to act I'm not. That's why I hate ordering online taxi unless I really need it.

DestinyChildGlobal,fczg9ay,t1_fczc0ls,1578100587.0,"Lol yea I know to some this is a weird idea, but I always keep some emergency money in my home stash for when I really need it and don't have cash. It's just something like that but also like a piggy bank, put 300k everyday to the stash lol. 

But I guess since the game give so much money, this is not that much of a matter. My money never go below 50 mil anyway. Just a weird idea of keeping money."

DestinyChildGlobal,fcqqd9n,t3_eihxgg,1577890521.0,If only they included the collab childs then I might consider buying it lol so you can get the collab childs you missed in the past or future.

One year later and I still haven't started watching the story again lol

I could be missing out, but honestly for me I just think the story is not that engaging. Not necessarily bad. And yeah, the voice acting is pretty solid. Even some of my favorite seiyuu is in the game!"
dontputyourdickinthat,fc5xejk,t1_fc4xiwk,1577467903.0,Now you gives me an idea. Make the farthest blade smaller and gradually become bigger the closer to the body. You will feel all the blades.

Play for a while until you get a grasp of what child is good or not. Mafdet and Hestia are pretty good attacker, even if you will probably not use them at all, they still useful for ragna and worldboss."

Just like that water slide game you've seen the ads everywhere.

Edit: that water slide game called aquapark.io also by voodoo lol"
