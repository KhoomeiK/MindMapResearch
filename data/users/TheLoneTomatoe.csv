AskMen,ffix1nx,t1_ffgwyyy,1579984798.0,I had to continue on just because I already dedicated so much time into it. I think the only decent season since then was the most recent one. Even then it's barely reaching the decent mark.
Kaylemains,ffhncgu,t1_ffhn3xv,1579943676.0,"Bro Darius is the easiest match up. Phase rush is a must have, unless you get really comfortable with his pull range (which I'll never be, it seems to get longer and longer). Stay way far away from him until 6, and at that point the lane is over for him. If you hit him with a q you and AA E and then chase him around for a second. He can't pull you, cause you're too quick with PR for him to get in range. 

Plus, if you can bait out the pull while you're chasing him with your PR then you can basically chase him back to his tower, If you dont kill him. 

All I did was watched kayle 1v9 play 1 or 2 games against him on youtube to kinda get the feel for it, and I havent had a single Darius escape lane without me solo killing him since. Once you figure it out you get happy when someone locks it in.


If you havent been using phase rush, you should really try it out for the more annoying all in matchups."

Got into S1. Went 1-1 twice, lost a single game with 0 LP an it demoted me. Got hard trolled some more and dropped to S2 0 LP, but it seems like the trolling is over.

Same situation, we recommended people they get ignored, he put his newly ""reformed"" son in law back in charge. Takes about 3 months for him to get caught doing the same thing.

I was having this same issue, stomping some lanes but still losing. Take a look at your wedding and roaming. Those two things will help you not only avoid ganks, but help your jungle and team track the enemy jungler, thus helping other lanes. 


Look at your positioning in team fights as well. One thing with Kayle in a silver ELO game is that you win late game, almost guaranteed, if you just position correctly. As long as you dont get blown up before the enemy inevitably blows ever summ and ult to kill the person they engage on, you win the fight. Save your ult for either yourself, or whoever is your teams carry. In some cases, it can be useful to use it on someone they're chasing down with low health. I can tell you I won 3 separate games yesterday due to enemy team chasing my sub 200 HP jungler at elder after I ulted him. Allowing me to completely obliterate the surviving members of their team. 


Also, play around with builds. I rotate from a manamune AD build (my current favorite) to a normal hextech AP build, depending on our teams damage totals."
