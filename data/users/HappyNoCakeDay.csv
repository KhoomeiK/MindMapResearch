Edit: Not sure if people have enough time to waste to Photoshop road signs, but it's a healthy mix of Interstate billboards and all other signs. Here's a mildly amusing one. https://i.imgur.com/YkGk7.jpg"

Gotcha."

WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fdjt8ox,t1_fdjd6yz,1578486680.0,"Yea it's a sub born from the meme by the same name. So there's the OP of a post or comment, a second person who asks OP a question or makes a statement that is obviously directed at OP, and the third person, in this case you, not op, who replies for the OP.

So on mobile here can't see usernames when I'm making a comment, OP posted cat video, someone else chimes in that OP should get a treadmill for their cat and you, not the OP chimes in that you have a cat wheel. Ergo, r/notopbutok. Just another way of saying ""Wasn't talking to you mate but thanks for info nonetheless.""

In short it's a dumb joke sub based on a meme. I'm shit at explaining things so hopefully that makes sense."

aww,fcyf7v1,t1_fcy6hcx,1578079192.0,"Speaking of Undertaker, I had a neighbor awhile back before I moved who was a mortician. One night he had a body he was preparing for a very early morning wake or service (whatever was going on, it was unusual, and it required him to work into the wee hours of the morning on this particular corpse).  

So as he’s working on it, he turned his back to grab some tools or supplies, and the angle he was standing at with regard to the corpse left the body visible just out of the corner of his eye. As he was looking down at whatever tools he was getting, in the corner of his eye he saw the body slowly start to sit up. His fight/flight instinct immediately kicked in, and he ran to the stairs as fast as he possibly could, but he was so clumsy trying to get up the stairs he tripped and was pretty much crawling and clawing his way to the top.  

He was just near the top before his senses finally came back, and he knew it was rigor mortis. He collected himself and started to laugh at how absurd it all was, as he recalled this exact same thing happening in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind of hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table."

That's why I'm asking wondering if you have relevant experience from a technical position in construction or you just a blue collar who taught yourself networking or something. Cause I'd be very much the latter."
