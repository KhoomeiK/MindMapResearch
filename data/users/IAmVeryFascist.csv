Im not religious at all, but it seems as if 90% of atheists are just resentful torward the religious and use any chance they get to just be absolute dicks for no reason.

Movie tickets are like 12 bucks in some places, and you have to make an evening out of it. Plenty of people are busy enough to just wait a month or so and rent for like 3 dollars or something."

This post is made by salty atheists and poor people that are envious of our successful lives. Meme and downvote all you want, but we will be the ones with strong retirement funds and  ownership of property while atheist spinsters will die alone on antidepressants in their apartment with their cats and HPV.

Too much truth for you? Its okay, click that downvote button and go back to being in denial."
