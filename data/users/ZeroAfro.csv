wyzecam,fcp756l,t3_ehzdjk,1577852698.0,"While the breach sucked, wyze responded well and even admitted fault (which says a lot), I have a degree dealing with networks (which covered network security and was taught a Certified Ethical Hacker) to give you some background.

Some of the sources and articles covering the event REALLY took the breach and blew it out of proportion and used a bunch of buzz words to get clicks and traffic.

The best thing you can do is put them all on a separate network (per FBI recommendations) but that isn't doable for most, so you can make a protected guest network and put your smart home stuff on that network. This will help isolate it from your computers and stuff like phones and tablets in case someone does get into your network through the smart home devices then they won't have a direct route to your phones, computers, tablets, etc.

Most people looking to break into homes aren't going to know how to even attempt to hack smart home devices or would even put the time or effort into doing that. Why spend 30 minutes+ trying to hack into a home to break in when they can go down the street to another house with no one home and break in through a unlocked door or smash a window in 30 seconds?

They are looking for easy targets, not to say it won't ever happen but the odds are VERY slim as most common thieves are looking for easy scores, in the time it would take to gain access to a home through a smart lock they could have broken into two or more houses.

There is also many other easier ways into your house such as the windows or glass doors that they would aim for first. Again not saying it isn't possible but the odds are low, the news makes it seem like it is a common thing where people hack into cameras and webcams. It happens but it isn't as common as they want you to believe and most of the time its not due to the webcam or device itself, its due to them getting into your network from weak passwords or after you got infected with malware (Trojan) from downloading or visiting something.

For example the ring doorbell being hacked was mainly due to how they handled your data. The hacker would gain access to your network and would intercept the packets from the doorbell which aren't encrypted. They also had a issue where you could access accounts with old passwords even after they changed.

The knowledge that smart devices can be hacked should be a factor in decision making on rather to use the products but don't fall victim to those horrible tech sites and the news that just spout buzz words and bs to make you click on their article, do actual research and make a informed decision based on facts.

Watch ""Inside the Mind of a Thief, Burglar Confessions"" by AllenCityTV

[https://youtu.be/DtwD-c9hn58](https://youtu.be/DtwD-c9hn58)

Many useful tips and things to keep in mind.

In England a lot of cars have Key less entry, thieves still don't try to really hack the lock, they still go down a street checking for unlocked house doors (or even breaking into the home in some cases), they step inside and look for keys stored in the entrance way or garage and then snatch them and grab the car.

It's not worth the effort to even try hacking/bypassing the lock when they could just find a unlocked home.

Of course you will still find people taking the route of hacking into them but it is far far far less common than just grabbing the keys.

Point being... with new tech comes the probability of it being hacked but the majority of thieves cannot, will not, or simple don't care enough to do it when they could simply bust a window or find a unlocked door.

But it is possible that people will try, that's just the nature of technology. As smart home tech becomes more common thieves will progress at some point down the line (still won't be a common thing for them to do in my opinion) but as people find ways to hack into them, the company will improve security to prevent that.

The issue right now is it seems like a lot smart home company's seem to push out new products to market and don't focus on security as much as they should (that's starting to change for the better it seems) but from what I have seen from wyze that is not the case for them.

This breach was from a employee who forgot to implement security on a new server or reapply security (without going into to much detail). The weak link was a employee rather than their security itself or someone hacking into their products.

&#x200B;

Some things you can do to defend yourself:

&#x200B;

* Keep all smart home devices and your router up to date with firmware updates

&#x200B;

* Regularly check your router logs for login attempts and connected devices

&#x200B;

* Hiding the SSID might help but it won't fool anyone who has any slight idea of what they are doing, there are even apps that scan for wifi and WILL find the SSID but it might be a measure worth doing.

&#x200B;

* Don't use descriptive Wifi names, I see a bunch of people naming it ""John's wifi"" or ""Ramirez family wifi"", name it something that doesn't give away any personal info.

&#x200B;

* Make a guest network (or even better a new network with another router) and move smart home devices (wyze products, google home, etc) onto the second network and password protect it.

&#x200B;

* There are many articles revealing the most common passwords that are hacked, look these lists over and avoid using any derivative of them.

&#x200B;

* Sign up with ""Have I Been Pwned"" you will be alerted if your email was exposed in a data breach and it will also list what other info has been exposed. Make sure to secure those accounts and change passwords on any account that uses the exposed password.

&#x200B;

* Change all Default passwords for your router and other devices.... so many... so so many people keep their default router password.

&#x200B;

* The weakest chain in ANY network is always the end user... you are more likely to get your network infected by downloading something or going to bad site than someone hacking into your network/smart home devices.

&#x200B;

* Make sure your routers and computer firewall is active and running

&#x200B;

* Avoid port forwarding anything unless you absolutely have to do it for a specific reason

&#x200B;

* If you can, ""limit""(reduce) the range at which your wifi broadcasts, do you really need wifi from the street? If you can use your wifi from the street then any passerby can to. Same routers offer this ability, otherwise you can play around with where your router is located.

&#x200B;

Sorry for rambling on, it is late and I am very tired so I could also have missed something (the list could be pages long if I wanted it to) or stated something wrong in my hasty and tired state. Feel free to let me know so I can correct it!

I don't only use wyze products but a variety of smart home items so while this post is addressing the wyze breach most of what I am talking about applies to all smart home technology and technology in general."
