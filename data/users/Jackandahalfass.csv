**Season One.** The newness of it, you can’t really get that first-time vibe more than once. I really liked the final four dudes. Alan was a great champion, fun guy to “hang out” with.

**Season Six.** Best champion. Moose kill. Other interesting people who didn’t stand a chance against this god among men.

**Season Two.** Still tear up when the winner learns he won.

**Season Three.** Not much wildlife. This is when the show veers towards a starvation competition. Champ not particularly charismatic.

**Season Five.** I’m not a fan of all-star games, but I was happy the champ got redemption, although this was made frustrating by the fact they hardly showed him, creating the impression he hibernated. Britt was a lot of fun on this one.

**Season Four.** Disaster. Bad idea, poorly executed. Flew in the face of the show’s very concept. We don’t speak of this one in my house."
