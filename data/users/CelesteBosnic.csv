sewing,fdl5x99,t1_fdl4xqs,1578517593.0,"It was pretty simple. I measured the patterns that needed to be printed and designed the web on Illustrator. When I printed the paper I cut it so as to cover the same shape as the fabric. Pressed the iron 30 seconds on 200°c (I did all of this in a special workshop that works with small projects)
I used silk fabric paint for the shoes, you could also mix it with ritt dye so that it sticks better to the fabric."
sewing,fdl5djp,t3_elxb5t,1578517327.0,"All right so I'll add more information regarding this. For making the cowl pattern I used the Faceshell I built plus a Styrofoam mannequin head. I wrapped it in saran wrap then added scotch tape, cut that out and marked darts to make it flat. The cowl has an invisible zipper on the back as well. The gloves are quite basic, just the shape of my hand plus a little extra. One of the sleeves has a built in zipper so I can use my phone while wearing this. Everything was sewed with a basic zig zag stitch and polyester thread."

sewing,fdkjt66,t3_elux01,1578505151.0,"So this suit was a little over my level of experience but it turned out pretty good. 
I used two different types of spandex, the white fabric is a more heavy knit spandex and the black fabric is a light diamond textured fabric.
I used [Stretchy's](http://www.stretchy.org/catsuit/) method for drafting the Catsuit pattern. And used a hood from a coat as a reference.
Contrary to how I initially thought I would sew it, I didn't sew the white and black fabrics right sides together, since the design of the suit has a lot of geometric shapes with very sharp corners I found it very difficult to sew it that way. So what I did was cut the white part a little longer on the torso and placing the black fabric over this and sewing with a zig zag stitch near the edge of the pattern.
The back has an invisible zipper that goes straight from the neck down to my hips. And the hood has another zipper that goes straight up, this way I can open them up completely and put it on without much trouble.
I designed the web pattern myself and used dye-sub printing.
I have a fun short video showing the whole process of how I made everything, from the suit to the shoes, if you want I can upload it here although the video is not sewing-centered."
