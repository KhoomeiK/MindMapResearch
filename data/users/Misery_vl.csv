offmychest,fcl7oxw,t1_fcl75z5,1577741599.0,"No offense taken at all, just actually felt good to write all of that out tbh. I hope my family can forgive me too, but I think the damage (emotionally and physically) that her husband has done to her is for good. My sister knows I will always have an open door for her, and I will always answer the phone (well maybe not right now but you get my point), but I don't think she will ever be able to see me as anything other than the guy who tried to get her kids taken away from her. But I am alright with being that guy, everyone's story has one, I just know how mine was written.

Thanks for the well wishes u/InsomniacEnglish, means more than you know."
offmychest,fcl6jdk,t1_fcl4kna,1577740883.0,"It's been about a month since I called. Sadly, all I know is my sister is ONLY allowed to have supervised visitation once a week, not sure about her husband, probably the same rules. My father, and my sisters husbands mother are the people appointed to supervise said visits (2 nieces btw). Apparently they found something bad enough to immediately pull the children and put them into safer hands. My family has a weird thing about CPS, my sister and I were taken from my father and given to my grandparents for 4 years due to a false claim and honestly bad luck, so calling them meant the possibility of never seeing those kids again. That was fear mongered into my mind for a long time, and I figured eventually my sister would leave him. 

 Let me be the first to admit **I WAS EXTREMELY WRONG FOR NOT SAYING ANYTHING AND WAITING SO LONG.**

The abuse was apparently consistent, as she hid it, lied to her family, and did whatever she could to hinder us from finding out. That being said, last year my sister had gotten into a horrible car accident, broke her femur, got surgery, and her husband stomped it a few months ago when they got into a fight and choked her against a wall. He did something to further damage her leg, and now she needs surgery that she can't afford. 

When I found this out, she lied, tried to hide it, but my grandmother sent me a picture of the bruise she had on her leg, shaped like a shoe. That was my final straw, I wanted to go to her house and drag the dude down the steps and do horrible things, but my wife calmed me and explained that I would be doing nothing but throwing my life away over someone who doesn't matter. So CPS was the call I had to make.

Also, in case you were wondering, CPS will not update the caller, we have no rights to know any updates to anything, so you'll basically be hearing it from a far and hoping for the best."
offmychest,fckufrb,t1_fckntg0,1577733428.0,"Unfortunately my sister did find out it was me, so it caused her to threaten me, threaten my wife, my family has basically told me that I am not a family member anymore. I also know what I did gives those girls the best chance to get away from it."
offmychest,fckll2e,t3_ehobx5,1577727982.0,"This hit close to home tbh. I had to call CPS on my sister for being in a drug and abuse infested home. Her husband beat her, the children were neglected, and my entire family disowned me for calling them. 

I just remembered a few months ago, getting off the phone with her after she cried her eyes out after he hit her again. It didn't sound like my sister, it sounded like a defeated woman who had just given up. 

Just remember that you did what was right, if they find nothing, great, if they find something, they can at least attempt to help them get their lives together again, or help them get away from the abuse. 

You're a hero in my eyes for calling, not that it means much from a stranger online, but I am proud of you for doing the right thing. Stay strong."
AskMen,fc6ucbm,t1_fc6nk69,1577489710.0,I second this as someone who used to drive like a crazy person. Learning some emotional techniques really helps out a lot more than people would think.
AskMen,fc6u86p,t3_eggp1r,1577489626.0,"I (27M) grew up with a pretty horrible family. Abuse, anger, screaming at each other, talking behind each others backs, manipulative, and just all around horrible people. I still keep in contact with my father, but that's about it.

As for dealing with them, there isn't much to do. You either can continue to make the effort to make things work, or just stop trying to make it work. No stranger on the internet can tell you what your head and body has already told you. Follow what it says, because it usually is always right. Have you have sat them down, explained yourself, and laid out some boundaries (Ex: I understand that you guys don't like my girlfriend, this is how I feel about it, and this is what I think we should do to compromise. I do not like that you do this, this is how it makes me feel, I don't think it should be acceptable. Hopefully you get it by now.)? If not I would start there, and make sure you pay attention to if their behavior changes. If it does, wonderful, you're on the path to building a better relationship with your fam, if not, well, then you may want to look into some therapy to get you to understand why this isn't a healthy option. 

I unfortunately will probably never get invited to another family Christmas again, and truthfully, that sucks, but I know I can't be surrounded by hate and anger my whole life either.

I really hope everything works out the way you want it to, and if not, there's always a reason. Keep your head up."
