DetroitRedWings,feymxlq,t3_eq6b5f,1579447743.0,Y‚Äôall all really sensitive about journalism. Maybe one of you should start your own rag and the armchair journalists can write expert pieces on the armchair GMs discussing possible line combinations for the 2023-2024 season.
DetroitRedWings,feymabe,t1_fetbaaf,1579447513.0,Are you a journalist?
DetroitRedWings,feym81n,t1_fet08f1,1579447492.0,You‚Äôre funny. You should take it on the road.
DetroitRedWings,fepl88d,t1_feopic5,1579323435.0,"I don‚Äôt understand the irrational hatred of HSJ. It‚Äôs always felt kind of sexist, TBH."
30ROCK,fen8osj,t1_fen1red,1579279401.0,"I love the Live episodes. They are incredibly difficult to do and were done with the SNL crew on their stage.  

The Queen of Jordan ones I cannot stomach. They are just too close to real reality shows that are unwatchable."
DetroitRedWings,feck3u6,t3_enzlky,1578975849.0,"Did these problems get worse, or improve, since Jim Bedard was let go?"

At least, that‚Äôs what I think of when I hear absolute wrench."
DetroitRedWings,fdpgu94,t1_fdoeok7,1578628265.0,I would not want Kessler for anything. He is a classless bum.  One of only a few players that I just cannot tolerate.

DetroitRedWings,fdgyq43,t1_fdgy2uk,1578411573.0,"You‚Äôre out of your mind if you think Steve Yzerman has or will allow acceptance of mediocrity. He said it will take years to rebuild and has preached patience. Wins/losses aside, the only reason to fire Blashill is if he‚Äôs lost the room and influence over players. Trust the Yzerplan and leave the fatalist cynicism to the Leaves fans. They deserve it ü§£."

DetroitRedWings,fcl71co,t3_ehraxu,1577741192.0,"Why is the rule misguided? The point of the all-star game is to promote the league. You can‚Äôt do that without representing every franchise. From a marketing perspective, it‚Äôs a good solid policy. If you‚Äôre worried about diluting the all-star pool the NHL has several other areas already ruin its credibility (Reffing, Player Safety...)"

DetroitRedWings,fc9cqor,t1_fc64hk5,1577550629.0,"From Mantha‚Äôs perspective I think it looked like Muzzin gave a solid elbow to Bowey‚Äôs head. In the heat of the game, it‚Äôs an easy decision to go in if that‚Äôs what Mantha saw. It would be interesting to hear his take."
DetroitRedWings,fc9c5cb,t1_fc79ac5,1577550386.0,Are you sure about that? Most French-Canadians are die-hard Habs fans and hate the Leaves as much as the rest of us.
