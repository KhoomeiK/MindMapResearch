That said, there are a couple interesting things here. First, your comparative rebuttal is not reasonable. Second, you're guilty of the same or worse negative condescending attitude, and it's completely uncalled for: ""I will not waste my time on you,"" or ""but you said this.""

Look and see how highly you hold yourself that you cannot waste your time on someone who is willing to stand up against behavior that is way out of line, even in the face of groupthink and adversity? Jesus, give me a break. There is so much wrong from people in this comments section. 

Anyways, the difference between calling people with this behavior like animals and people completely ignoring the argument is actually categorically different. Using creative language, albeit insulting, *as part of making your point* was maybe not a good approach, but it is completely different than literallg *ignoring the argument* and instead wanting to intentionally replace it with false accusations and *personally* insulting accusations.

Did my comment strike a nerve with you or something, because you responded to me with this multiple times before you clearly even thought it through?

This is sometimes not the case, such as with rackets that were setup by corporate lobbyists to use government regulations to monopolize markets, for example with insuling or MRI machines, or a thousand other things. But typically consumers do have a demand for, and choice, to consume goods and services that actually work. The political economy around scientific research is not like that. 99% of the time the subject is so esoteric that only a small group of people would be knowledgeable on it. There is nothing being sold and bought here, so there is no inherent mechanism within a market of competing products to determine the value of any such research: it literally does not even have to work to be published.

>conventional wisdom is also staggeringly wrong very often. There may be flaws in the scientific process as we currently do it, but it's the best we have. 

First, the words you wrote and put in a quote are not my words, but a misinterpretation that you then used to misrepresent my comment.  

Second, my argument is not comparative with respect to the accuracy of conventional wisdom vs the current academic scientific political economy. If I was making such an argument, I'd say the scientific method is by far the best process we have, but that the current political economy which exists often does not follow it, which is why Nature.com, Veritasium and others are talking about a reproducibility crisis.   

Finally, there are famous examples of ""science"" being wrong. For example, Egas Moniz was awarded a Nobel Prize in Medicine for the lobotomy procedure, and not longer after, a Kennedy family member had this done to their detriment. Other current examples would be the ""scientific"" consensus around sugar, fat and salt, which has been the subject of recent widespread criticism.   

The trouble is, the scientific method is actually extroardinarily rigid, but most ""science"" doesn't actually strictly follow it. Statistical methods involving p-hacking and group think pass off as scientific evidence vetted by peer review. This is how we get so much useless, irreproducible science. Yet, it doesn't much matter because most people don't understand the difference, or just don't care, between What is science and what is a ""scientific"" consensus."

I said, 'I don't need to care about epaulettes or appearancss.' As DFW says, the world shouldn't think of me in a way which it cares about what car I drive.'   

That's a very dangerous basket to throw your eggs in, and it spelled out life-ruining consequences.    

In reality, while I still believe you want to search to be loved within your close friends and family, even if you find that I would say you are lucky. To search for a world which will love you is to search for fairy tales.
