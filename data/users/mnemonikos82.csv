aww,fgsznh4,t1_fgszakd,1581095986.0,"For sure, the dog has been trained to do this. I'm sure it's a regular thing (maybe not that height, but still). I'm also floored at just how directly the dog lands on its legs with no forward or lateral movement to allay some of the force. I'm not a vet, just an amateur trainer, but it makes me cringe to watch."
aww,fgscvdv,t1_fgs9knk,1581080720.0,Not from this height. The amount of force being absorbed by the CCL in a 20ft free fall is enormous.
aww,fgscr1k,t1_fgs8adv,1581080612.0,"Hip dysplasia isn't the issue here for jumps, Sheps and Mals are always at a big risk of cranial cruciate ligament (similar to an ACL in humans) ruptures and that's what this activity would likely result in as they hit the ground and all that force is absorbed by their legs. Hips would also absolutely absorb a lot of energy as well, but they're more resilient. Hip dysplasia is a genetic condition involving a malformation, not something you create through trauma."
AmItheAsshole,fgq4uti,t1_fgq4aah,1581017902.0,"Agreed, I guess my comment was more about churches that try to trick people in the doors with a bait and switch, and encourage the kids of the church to do the recruiting."
AmItheAsshole,fgq3lb7,t1_fgohck0,1581017224.0,"Our church youth groups hold events at our church that are just fun nights (black light parties and such), everyone is encouraged to bring friends, but the ONLY thing closely resembling evangelizing is at the very end of the night, we spend 30 seconds extending a low key invitation to the more religiously centered events (""Hey, here's who we are, and a list of upcoming events and what they're about, we hope you'll join us"" sort of thing). That's the end. We don't hide who we are, but we also don't disguise evangelization as something else like some Willy E Coyote/Rube Goldberg trap for non-Christians."
AmItheAsshole,fgq2t0z,t1_fgp820p,1581016795.0,"In general, ""hell theology"" just simply doesn't belong in an 8yo Sunday School. The only caveat for me would be a church that strongly encourages in-home discipleship where parents are educated to be able to prepare the kid, but even with that I struggle imagining how you could possibly prepare a child that young to wrestle with the concept of hell. This whole thing smacks of 1930's fundamentalism."
AmItheAsshole,fgq18rg,t3_eznvcc,1581015948.0,"NTA, Like a couple other posters, I consider myself a devout Christian and believe in evangelical principles (not the same as being an ""evangelical"" in case there is confusion). And your husband, OP, is dead wrong. It was underhanded, 100%, and smacks of fundamentalism. First of all, 8yo Sunday School is not the place to teach hell theology. Second of all, this isn't the 1920's, you can't trick people into belief and you can't indoctrinate other people's kids on the sly. I would absolutely 100% be concerned and angry if another parent took my young child to a religious center other than my own without telling me (even other churches). Any exposure to religion requires context and preparation. How would this mother feel if a friend's parents took THEIR child to a Mosque or a  Buddhist Temple for religious worship and teaching, without their consent or warning? I'm going to go out on a limb and guess they'd be pretty pissed."

In other words, never underestimate someone based on flawed human perception of their physical characteristics."

CHIBears,fgm0h2f,t1_fgl2757,1580915364.0,"People forget that and it's frustrating. My thought has always been that a fully guaranteed contract that can't be traded is the same as a 0 money contract when it comes to whether to keep a player. The money is gone whether he's on your team or not, whether he's a 1st string WR or 6th on the depth chart. The question you have to ask is does he bring any value as a player, is he better than the last player on the depth chart. If so, then you have to keep him."

AncientGreek,fgj0ww4,t1_fgitqbc,1580834870.0,"Well I certainly respect your opinion, in the post above I did already state that I understood that Jesus spoke in Aramaic, and I did point out that the aesthetics of the Greek alphabet was a factor in my decision, just not the only factor or the main factor. Believe it or not I did actually search for the original manuscripts to find some usable information, but could not find anything that I would be able to accurately copy since they are all scans (and incomplete some of the time at that) and not recreations that I found. I do not have the artistry to copy font from a digital scan of a 1900-year-old manuscript. 

Ask your point about understanding the verses, I'm not sure what you mean. My understanding of the verses is pretty good from the English. The reason I chose this specific phrases I did, is because they both represent theological concepts that are incredibly important to me from how they have impacted my life. I won't get into details but the idea, as Jesus presented it, of the rock as the foundation of faith and the narrow gate as the expectation of navigating the world as a Christian, are hugely important to me. My goal in asking for help in this sub was because I didn't want to be one of those folks that put something random on their skin and have it not mean what they think it means. That to me would be incredibly disrespectful to Greek speakers and to the scriptures. As to why Greek, I don't know that I can state it better than I already have.

For what it's worth, I do completely understand where people who would be against this idea are coming from as Greek speakers. I am a citizen, card carrying, of the Cherokee Nation (If you're not from the US, that is a tribe of indigenous people) and I do know what it's like to have people who have no connection whatsoever with the Nation to use our cultural icons and syllabary, especially incorrectly. The difference here is that the Bible belongs to all Christians and The New testament was written in Greek. So I consider those situations to be apples and oranges, but I do 100% completely understand why a native Greek speaker would not agree with me. But there is a difference in my mind between this and, say, using modern Greek or something of historical significance to Greeks and Greeks alone without a personal connection.

Thank you for your input in this process, please at least believe that I have heard your concerns and did not just dismiss them or consider them invalid."
