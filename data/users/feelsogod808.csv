sadcringe,ffa7lf5,t1_ffa5594,1579729437.0,"It mean it's a bit too long to write in a reddit comment but it all comes down to you and how you act. If you have the ""I'm going to nice my way in"" itll never work.

I was so stupidly nice even the ones that were interested in me thought I was gay or not interested. That's how much of an idiot I was.


Just the way you talk and how you act will put yourself in the right category. Having the perfect amount of arrogance and humility like Patrice says.


Go check him out on women on YouTube. Hes a but over the top but some things are just wow...

I know a girl who is leaving her newly married husband because shes no longer attracted to him anymore. The dude is the nicest loyal nice of the nicest type of guy <- she cant even stand him touching her. Hes nice but has nothing going for him job wise, he doesnt lead the relationship. He just goes "" whatever you want to do babe""  women bloody hate that."
sadcringe,ff9zvjj,t1_ff9rbz2,1579725043.0,"Nah I have similar stories back in the day. Some even more cringey and sad.

But one day, enough was enough and I got so angry I just changed the way i was. No longer became that nice guy and I never fell into situations like that again."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff8qnla,t1_ff8ql0s,1579692069.0,"He never said ""free icecream"" from what I can remember. He just told the kids to get in a line. 


And you could easily tell it was a bday with the presents and the hats lol"
MakeMeSuffer,ff8pvex,t1_ff70w28,1579690966.0,I did this to my android. Just pull it out with pair of pliers.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ff8oyfz,t1_ff7x8zy,1579689632.0,"
I have a similar story but on the other end.

I had a bday party in the park in front of my dad's icecream store. There were maybe like 15 kids I invited. When my dad called out he had icecream They all lined up to get a scoop. Some random kid lined up thinking it was some free ice cream day.


My dad was like "" uhhh this isnt free ice cream day. Do you know my son?

The kid looked sad and embarrassed so he gave him one anyway."

Ayahuasca,ff738t9,t3_ervxan,1579640237.0,"When I had my ego death it was the most beautiful thing I ever experienced. For me nothing mattered anymore for the time I lost it, there was no time, no place,no me. I forgot everything of who I was and what I wanted to be. Just nothing. I watched the billions of stars above me rotating like infinite galaxies. I learnt alot of things in that short moment but I didnt have a single negative feeling or felt scared. I kinda wonder if my experience was an ego death at all since other people say theirs was so tough."

Nz is also doing a microdosing trial soon so well find out soon."

facepalm,ff5sh63,t1_ff5rymo,1579608537.0,Why would they take the job in the first place if they believed it as such?
facepalm,ff5q525,t1_ff5op9b,1579605649.0,The pendulum will eventually even itself out. Back in the day it was only men. Now they're picking women just for the sake of it but eventually the incompetent ones will ruin the company or be fired. The good ones will stick around and well go back to hiring for skill and experience like we always should've done.

microdosing,feik9f6,t1_fehubtz,1579140481.0,"I agree! It's a not a magic pill you take and go ""fix my problem!"" 

It merely give you insight and perspective from different angles to solve problems in your life.

Lsd basically throws you a tool box and now with all that gear you can start repairing and building something with your life.

Also makes you think about things you've been hiding away until you deal with it.


I already had drive and focus before trying psychadelics. Now I'm going full on because I know what I'm doing wrong and what I need to be doing. What matters most. Etc"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdq52yu,t1_fdovwfb,1578655212.0,"I bought a doggy birthday cake for my dog and hid it in the dog pantry for her special bday. Some how my food loving dad managed to sniff his way into the pantry and ate the WHOLE damn cake. When I came home my dad was like 

""hey.. I think that cake was a bit off""

""Wtf dad! That was for the dog! It's a cake made for dogs! Jesus christ! You ate the whole thing even though it tasted funny??""


""Yup....""


I love my Dad but hes a god damn idiot sometimes."
LSD,fdp3d00,t1_fdnna5t,1578619029.0,"I think religion at the start were people who tripped and had these wild spiritual hallucinations. The first thing you want to do is tell everyone about it. Your experience is so profound and life changing, you want everyone else to experience it you know?



I noticed I felt like an advocate for psychadelics. Telling friends and family and my gf about it. They looked at me like a crazy delusional hippie but I didnt care, I know what I felt was real and spiritual for the first time

I realized I was just like those people on the streets asking ""have you let jesus christ into your heart?""

Except I was replacing jesus with mushrooms lol"
musicproduction,fdissv2,t3_elflox,1578450245.0,"Been mucking around for 10 years. Seriously started in the last 3 years. 

1st year had 1 Sync deal on Netflix and my first million plays on Spotify.

Started off by just doing remixes for fun. (bootlegs)

Eventually people started asking for official remixes.

I did them for free, I was just happy someone wanted a remix from me.

2nd year I was charging around $200USD for remixes

This year I charged $850USD for a remix so made a big jump. The big labels seem to have the money to pay that sort of price.

&#x200B;

These days im making around $500USD a month in stream consistently.

Ps: Still not a professional"

musicproduction,fdgdk6t,t3_el982c,1578391665.0,You wont be able to post it on any streaming platforms like spotify or apple music. But you could post it on sc and yt. Itll probably get flagged or ad revenue will go to the artist directly.

Putting on heavy weights to weigh you down so when you take it off, you will be lightning fast.
