AmItheAsshole,ff91xb0,t3_es6cjd,1579702812.0,NTA. I went for a job at a primary school as dinner lady recently and I was asked how I could get a child to eat more veggies. This is the kind of answer they wanted. My answer of 'Blackmail' was apparently wrong.

news,fes6rcb,t1_ferqiry,1579361998.0,"Not true. I was raped, neglected, tortured, passed around from man to man by my father. I watched my cat get killed, my baby brother was beaten in an attempt to manipulate me and my sister was threatened. Whilst I smiled when I read some of the details of this mans death, the thought of hurting another living thing cripples me. I could not and would not and I am yet to  meet anyone who was then raised normally to have any evil thoughts. None of the kids I came into contact with which had had the same thing happen to them would hurt anyone or anything but themselves. It is a rare event indeed that an abused child will seek out to cause the same pain they themselves went through. There would be far more dangerous serial killers on the loose if being abused was indeed a precursor to being a maniac. It is indeed true that a lot of serial killers have been subjected to some type of abuse but not even a small percentage of abused kids go on to abuse others."
news,fes2prd,t1_fers3ml,1579360810.0,"Look into what a paedophile is before putting Prince Andrew's name to anything. He might have done some shitty things and he might have had some shitty friends but nothing I mean NOTHING he has done points to him being a paedophile. Virginia Roberts was 17 when Epstein peddled her to Prince Andrew, this vile creatures victims ranged from 6 months old to 12 years old. In the UK you can be legally married with children at 16 (Virginia says it happened in the UK) and not need parental permission so having sex with a 17 year old is soooooo far removed from being a paedophile it's shocking. Not to say he isn't or wasn't dodgy but he is NOT a paedophile. Jimmy Savile,  Gary Glitter is, this fucker is. Prince Andrew is not."
barkour,ferp8uw,t1_feok1ia,1579356787.0,"I have said border collies are the worst named dogs in the world. If anything should ever have been named a Springer it is a border collie. I have a border collie and a 5 foot wall. When next doors tiny dog is out the neighbour just sees my dogs head springing up over the wall. Doggo smart though, huge drop on the other side so she has never tried to clear the wall. Just springs up, boing boing boing like the Springer fruit loop that she is. Goddam I love my dog, she's hilarious!"

But yeah, one 6 hour walk a day might do it for a border collie, providing there is another 3 hour walk after that. They do not have an off switch. They don't really sleep, they just pretend to sleep. That last part may not be a fact and may just be my experience of border collie ownership. But damned if they aren't the cleverest, sweetest, just the most handsome of dogs! I absolutely adore my girl and that feeling is mutual. You never see anyone saying how glad they are to have a border collie, you only ever hear 'They are maniacs and you will die before they stop running' but really, my girl really is an amazing, incredible, smart and stunningly beautiful dog and I genuinely feel so lucky to have her. She gives the best cuddles!"
barkour,ferms38,t1_feocpcv,1579355893.0,"I have a young border collie and an old staffy cross. It isn't the speed, it is the endurance lol. My old boy can outrun my young girl....for about 5 minutes. After that old dog be like 'Nah, you go at my speed now' Young dog is OK with that but after we've done 5 miles at old dogs speed and we are ready for going home, young dog is looking at us saying 'Hey, that was my warm up, I want more!' I think most I did was 12 miles in one day and girl STILL wasn't tired. Old boy would literally stop and refuse to move if I tried to make him walk that far."
AmItheAsshole,feerjth,t3_eoley4,1579039685.0,"YTA. My husband is an ass and he dictated a lot of things about our wedding but even he knows there would have been absolutely no wedding if I wore a 100 dollar dress from the internet because he didn't sent ehpoint of an expensive dress. He didn't see the point but he would NEVER have been so self absorbed to have made the suggestion you did. He isn't THAT clueless about compromise, give and take and all the stuff that makes a good relationship. He had a 1000 quid made to measure suit and you know what, I ,ove that sucker more than he does. It is totally fucking normal to have a wedding dress fitting too you dim wit. Weddi g dresses are designed to be able to be altered quickly and easily. All women are different sizes and shapes, how did you get to the age of 38 without already knowing that? Ah but you did but you are being selfish and thoughtless and it fits your narrative for any old dress to fit your girlfriend. 

Seriously, am so glad I don't know you. And because my husband never tried to pull that shit on me today I have a new appreciation for him!"
AskReddit,fdq3w7q,t1_fdpf926,1578653617.0,"Truthfully, late 90's to about 2004 were a blur anyway. They were my 'If it gets me high I want it' years. I did not escape unscathed, my memory is so poor now that I forgot I had Slim Shady on mini disc and I had that long before I split with my ex in 2003. 

Which got me thinking about my banging tune of the 90's. Cher-Believe."

funny,fdl84yl,t1_fdkqpwp,1578518663.0,Jumping out of first floor windows. My brother did it and many years later my nephew did it. Wtf is it with boys just wanting to die the second they are born?

funny,fd5ia11,t1_fd59zf6,1578177939.0,Except it is a grandmother and it isn't the first time she has done it which as far as I am concerned makes it even better.
AmItheAsshole,fczsxoy,t1_fczoynz,1578108072.0,Tell me about it. Went no contact with her 7 years ago. Has been 7 years of not dealing with her shit and it’s been lovely.
worldnews,fczo46k,t1_fcya63u,1578105485.0,I can tell you it is banned in the UK. My father in law needed it because he is allergic to Proton Pump Inhibitors but now they would rather you bleed to death from gastritis than get cancer. Old fella has had a bad gut since his stroke so basically sits there in pain all day long now. Shame coz it was a bloody good drug for its purpose.
AmItheAsshole,fczkskl,t1_fcz2agl,1578103399.0,"My youngest nephew has the same first and second names as my dead baby boy. My only child I may add. Millions of names on the planet yet my sister chooses my baby’s names. As if the father of her kid being my ex wasn’t enough of a kick in the face, she had to add insult to injury.  People that fucking evil do exist and they usually get everything they ever want too because they will destroy people to fulfil their needs. Raging narcissists!"
AmItheAsshole,fcyr0oy,t1_fcxpweo,1578085286.0,"I have no friends, still wasn't sorry the selfish bitch known as my sister wasn't involved. I invited literally 2 people to my wedding. Wtf do you mean 'I doubt someone with no friends has the guts to kick someone out in the first place!' Who are you to make such a nasty rotten statement??? Ever heard the saying 'With friends like that, who needs enemies?' This day, not now or ever, is about what OP wants and needs. She can have her hair dyed absolutely any time whatsoever but instead sabotages a bride on what is probably the biggest day of her life. Just what kind of person does that? I don't even know OP but i wouldn't piss on her if she was on fire, no one needs friends or family who would even consider something like that.  And seems you are the same kind of person. Yuk. The next time someone asks me why i prefer my dogs to humans i will show them this thread."
AmItheAsshole,fcx69y0,t1_fcvxpcx,1578052981.0,"They wouldn't be my bridesmaid if they pulled this shit on me. Oh, I forgot, my sister DID try to pull this shit on me for my wedding and long story short, she was literally the only person who came to my wedding who didn't have a role. OP, you are selfish, this wedding is not about you and your goddam hair. You don't deserve to be in the wedding party with your attitude."
AmItheAsshole,fcjv6ht,t3_ehe800,1577706318.0,"NTA. You have 2 daughters, no ifs no buts. Granny is being an asshole and it should be known that someone recognises it. If treating one child  better than the other continues the slighted one will notice and eventually it will cause a lot of stress, tension and resentment. Stop it now whilst it is fresh and excuses cannot be made. 

Btw, I along with my brother and sister are adopted. My parents would never have tolerated us being treated any less than actual family in any circumstance and it never happened. This granny is being an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,fc5vcvx,t3_eg5c4x,1577466703.0,"NTA and my husband a former non pet lover totally agrees. I had a cat and dog when we met. He didn't like my cat and my dog didn't like him but he had absolutely no choice but to accept the animals if he wanted me. We are on year 11 and he spends most of his days cuddled up to one of the 3 fur kids we have and I am certain he wouldn't have life any other way. The dog that didn't like him btw is now his best friend in the whole world. And incidentally, the second your boyfriend unlocks the door for the first time the house value has decreased, he's an idiot if he doesn't already know that and if he thinks previous pet ownership has any bearing on the value of a house he has a lot to learn about home ownership."
AskReddit,fbzyzio,t3_efchi8,1577269462.0,"It is 10.16am christmas day and I'm in tears. Already can't wait for today to be over. Got no friends or family to celebrate with, am penniless, my marriage is in ruins and right now am facing homelessness which wouldn't bother me so much but I have 2 dogs and a cat and really cannot part with them so am scared, really really scared. Can't even say it's my worst christmas.  Am pretty much fucked. 

Merry christmas."
