todayilearned,fcojns0,t1_fcohltb,1577833904.0,"The acronym has a long and complicated history, but I'll do my best to summarize.

People often use LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender \[some people do LGB, but that's just no good and often associated w/ major transphobia. do NOT do this.\]

There's more identities though that are often marginalized - intersex, asexual/aromantic, pansexual, nonbinary, etc, etc. Sometimes people use LGBTQ - the 'q' stands for 'queer' which is a sort of umbrella term, but it's a reclaimed slur, so some people don't feel comfortable with it - others use it as their term for their identity.

LGBTQIA includes some of those extra identities, but there are always more, and the community is all about not leaving anyone out, for good reason! So the '+' helps hold all those extra identities.

I've also seen the term 'lavender' community used, but my favorite is GRSM - gender, romantic, and sexual minorities, which I really feel like covers all the bases reasonably succinctly, but it isn't in super common use.

If you want to use the term, go with LGBT+, or LGBTQ+, is what I'd say. LGBT is fine, but the + is nice."

Also, someone mentioned LGBTQ+ stuff earlier. Please:

* make it clear you support that group - if your kid is LGBT and not out, this will reassure them that you are safe to come out to; if they're not LGBT, it's setting a good example. (as a side note - if you don't support LGBT people, if you're one of those people who would kick out your kid if they were LGBT - I don't know what to say to you. you shouldn't have had kids)
* if your kid comes out, immediately make it clear you still love them. even if you need time to talk things over, figure out what it means: immediately make it clear that they are safe and loved. no matter what. if you don't love your kid no matter what, you need to reconsider some things.
* recognize their LGBT-ness - 1) make sure they have proper sex-ed. health class can be especially hit or miss on lgbt stuff; 2) if they are trans/have gender dysphoria try to immediately help validate that - counselor so they can begin transition, affirming clothing, binder if relevant, talk to school for things maybe, help with new name possibly, \&c; 3) is school supporting necessary? safety stuff - is your area unfriendly to lgbt people? is your church occasionally...iffy on these issues? make sure they'll be in safe spaces; 4) talk to your kid, look on internet (r/lgbt is good) for advice/help with questions, maybe try to help your kid get in an lgbt group? GSA is a common one at schools in the U.S.; 5) maybe go with them to a pride parade? get them a pride flag or a funny shirt as a gift? don't ignore it, basically.
