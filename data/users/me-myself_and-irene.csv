Prozac: might also treat anxiety.


Possible Prozac Side effects: anxiety (anxiety is listed in the top 5 most common side effects!)


Prozac Will take  approximately 6 weeks before it starts working.

...gee thanks doc

I'll just not sleep for 6 weeks and keep my fingers crossed that I might fall into the ""other"" category for Prozac uses. No fucking thanks."
gamernews,ffzvpc4,t1_ffzrgtg,1580394132.0,"I don't know if I was simply unlucky or Nintendo is selling faulty products, I'm not sure. One thing I am sure of is that it wasn't mistreated, my daughter never took to video games and it stayed safely in a drawer or safely docked. 

Like I said it has never left the house, my daughter used it in bed a few times but other than that it stays in the living room and not used a portable device. It's impossible to misuse something that doesn't get touched. I was sold a POS. 


Edit: In all fairness, Nintendo repaired it for free and the aftermarket dock is way better than the one made by Nintendo. The USBC AC adapter is a quick fix too. It was more or less an inconvenience and cost me about $30 for a new dock. The Switch still works fine, but I don't think I will ever buy one of their products again."
gamernews,ffzqdvw,t1_ffznatx,1580389812.0,"I bought one for my daughter. The games are not really for me but I do occasionally half-heartedly play a few. I can't speak for everyone but after about 20 hours of use (6 months of actual ownership) the console stopped charging. After I received a free repair from Nintendo, a few DAYS later the docking station stopped working. After I purchased a new (not made by Nintendo) docking station, THE OLD AC ADAPTER STOPPED WORKING TOO. Every component that came with my switch stopped working in less than a year, with very minimal use and never carried outside of the house. 


Ive got a PlayStation that I literally found 5 years ago (no telling how old it really is) and it still works 100%."

The Doc asks me if I'm depressed, I say no. 


She asks me if I suicidal, I say no. 


She asks me if I have trouble sleeping, I say yes.


Then the doctor looks me dead in the eyes and goes, ""I'm going to prescribe you Prozac, it's an antidepressant that might make you suicidal and give you problems sleeping at night. 


I swear to God, the doctor prescribed me a drug that has my symptoms listed at side effects. 


It's. A. Fucking. Racket. 

Google EVERYTHING the doctor prescribes you. This isn't 1980, you have resources, use them. 

Doctors, lawyers, mechanics, they're all the same piece of shit that charge you for things you don't need.

Your ""distinction is important"" argument is you attempting to gaslight me. I don't know if you realize that you were just picking apart my comment like an asshole, but you were.  

Distinction isn't fucking important when its a joke comment buried at the bottom of a Reddit post. 

So..

*your* definition of kink is wrong.  

Kink is defined in the Oxford dictionary as a person's unusual sexual preference.

There's no asterisks with age or rape or anything else. You need to broaden your own definition. It's a dumbass conversation that you initiated. Don't comment on Reddit with useless shit, there's already enough of that going around as it is."
entertainment,ffxsnmt,t1_ffx600z,1580331629.0,"You didn't add any value to the conversation.

Why are you sitting around on your phone all day, picking apart people's comments with vague useless arguments? 

Get a life, man."

How about this, since you didn't like ""kinks"" for some dumbass reason. Did you expect him to lead with being a child rapist?"
