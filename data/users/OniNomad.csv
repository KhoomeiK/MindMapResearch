movies,fdm2faz,t1_fdlxymq,1578538197.0,"To clear up the source of confusion Rick Baker did the special effects for An American Werewolf in London which shares a combined spot with the The Howling in the hearts of many Werewolf film fans. They're both great in there own right, everyone has a favorite but together an important moment for the genre. I got see the head mechanism from the transformation in An American Werewolf in London and honestly was one of my biggest geek-outs."

todayilearned,fcuyep2,t1_fcufarp,1577991008.0,It works now because corporations do believe that a large percent of the population shouldn't earn enough to get by. Those low paying jobs are subsidized by tax payers to keep a broken system afloat.
todayilearned,fcu7rjr,t1_fctjwyo,1577974568.0,"Your argument says to if you can get by on those 20% of jobs that currently don't pay enough to get by on no one would do ""skilled jobs"", only people working ""skilled jobs"" therefore can get by. If your believe everyone should be able to get by then everyone should be working ""skilled jobs"". If that's the case then those other jobs would have to pay as much as ""skilled jobs"" to attract people, leading back to minium wage jobs would have to pay enough to survive on. The only way your argument works if you assume that a large percent of the population shouldn't be allowed to earn enough to survive on."
todayilearned,fctfe6k,t1_fcteagv,1577941508.0,"So 42% of American workers earn less than$15, let's rough estimate and say slightly less than half those earn less then $10. So we'll call that 1 in 5 jobs. By your logic all those people need to do another job if they want to be comfortable, ignoring your emphasis on them putting themselves into debt and spending years training for the job before they get the job, if everyone got jobs that let them live comfortably who the fuck do you think is going to do 20% of the jobs no one can afford to do? Your logic still created a situation where burger flippers earn almost as much as engineers because how else are you going to get people to do those jobs in a world where to survive you must get a college degree."
