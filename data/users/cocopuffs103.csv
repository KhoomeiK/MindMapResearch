At the risk of drinking from the same well as the communists, a lot of these issues are somewhat economic and the culture is built around that (in terms of consolidating or acquiring wealth) especially so for matrimonial issues, as the economy modernises they kind of go away on their own. As for the other issues, people are only as civil as you force them to be and when state institutions are broken to a certain point, then chaos is the order of the day; you will find this quite apparent when looking at the social issues that plague South America and Eastern Europe.

You should look up Plato's allegory of the cave, it depicts the same thing through an interesting illustration.

To summarise Socrates paints society as people shackled and bound in the darkness of a cave where their only understanding of truth is the shadows on the cave wall, if someone was to break free and witness the truth then upon returning and trying to convince them of it he will become an enemy to them and they would seek to do him harm as their very reality is shadows .

This would have been around 375 BC, so as you can see not much has changed after all as the Quran tells us:


""Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said,""When is the help of Allah ?"" Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near."" - Al Baqarah 2:214

Socrates goes on to say that the duty of the enlightened man is to free others from the darkness, but frankly things being what they are i would say saving yourself should be the only priority for as long as you deem it.

The fact that you bother to think about this stuff already puts you leagues ahead of most people who are ruled purely by emotions, in the end it's one of the few things besides luck that saves you in life."

As for a lot of other things i believe a skewed perspective/translation is what is at fault e.g. 'son(s) of god' is used a fair bit in Jewish texts but they never take it literally  (good examples here http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13912-son-of-god )

Indeed Islam claims that both the Bible and Jewish texts  (e.g. we don't believe god killed all the firstborns of Egypt) are corrupted, still we have patches of the earlier texts (e.g. Jewish Kosher and Jesus as a messiah [in the apocalyptic vein]).

Muslims do believe god loves them according to scripture but each man is accountable for his own sins and original sin doesn't exist.

I'm not going to sell you Islam, it has its own flaws if you look close enough and that is true with all scripture (from what ive come to believe, possibly incorrectly); but for whatever reason monotheism resonates with me and i find that Christian monotheism has been poisoned to the point that it has come to resemble polytheism and that is now apparent in its newer evolutions like LDS."

Them rules of engagement must be pretty loose if they are hitting weddings and farmers every other day. 

But again what do we really know, the government is a lot better at covering up nowadays than Vietnam, yet the rosiest picture is still bleak as fuck. 

I don't think you can compare the two, a brown foreigner has no real value to the US gov and largely the people; an American can still vote and affect change, the media and populace still somewhat care."
Christianity,feg18kk,t1_fefphqe,1579072592.0,"I think the main problem is these beliefs aren't foundational alone, if you look at how the bible was formed it is a selection of books whereas not all books were included for many reasons ( e.g some repeated largely the same thing , others were deemed heretical etc) in all cases  they were compiled by men who are all too  fallible (barring the assumption that the holy spirit guided them)  and you did end up with different scriptures that varied to extreme degrees  ( as is the case for some gnostic scriptures )

Infact some of these 'foundational' truths were only decided upon centuries after Jesus's time (e.g. the council of Nicea was in 325) and even then under the auspices of Constantine who also gave a platform to Arianism to maintain the peace (e.g. Arius was readmitted, an Arian Bishop baptised him  )  and they had their own meetings to establish the 'foundational truth' e.g. Sirmium."
changemyview,fefzi3b,t1_fee9rbk,1579070603.0,"The premise itself is flawed, Japan surrendered largely due to the Soviets entering the war and exhausting their chances of favourable terms.

The atom bomb and planned invasion were all meant to force a surrender prior to that outcome but  clearly they  failed.

It was framed as the reason by both Americans (to justify nuking) and the Japanese government (to shield the emperor from disgrace) but many believe it was unecessary militarily  (Mcarthur included according to his Biographer) especially since the US kept the only real precondition they would have wanted (sparing the emperor) when they surrendered unconditionally."
lostgeneration,fefqbba,t1_feemeu5,1579062173.0,"I would say that's a bit of an exaggeration, the military is killing people almost randomly which is why they designated all 'military aged males' killed as militants ,  to boot they intentionally kill  first responders as part of double tap bombings. 

If it ever gets to that in the states it will require a dictatorship or civil war."
Christianity,fefogm3,t1_fefmb08,1579060846.0,"Naturally,  but that is a matter of perspective more than anything else and considering orthodox schools generally rely on numbers to stake  their claims it becomes a bit of a moot point e.g. if Mormons become the largest Christian sect are they still heretical? (Afaik they are openly polytheistic)"

Considering the downvotes people are really sensitive about  desert fashion."
