One thing the DNC did was they knew Clinton had a following on her own (historically famous, for many reasons) and scheduled primary debates on nights with low viewership to prevent people from knowing about Bernie. He has commented on this politely, while not pointing fingers, and he has admitted his disappointment with how he was treated in the 2016 primaries.

I own a brick and mortar bike shop and one of our repeated advertising phrases is “just get them in the door” because when someone has their physical body in a store they are suddenly more connected to the product, and humans can always up-sell them at the register by having a conversation with them.

Winnipeg,fdm17ft,t3_els5ae,1578537376.0,"The city’s rational to raise (nearly double) the fees to $3.50/H was that the Pallister provincial government had cut their entire half of Winnipeg Transit’s budget and we, as a city, would have to make up he money elsewhere. Then that year Winnipeg Transit ran a surplus and had too much money than they knew what to do with. This was also after an Exchange Biz committee suggested installing ANY parking meters in Osborne Village or Corydon Village which both serve the same purpose for shopping and eating that the Exchange District serves, would more than balance the budget without hurting the city core which we are desperately trying to revive, but for some reason it was the Exchange that had to be responsible for the entire city’s budget shortfall. They also raised parking at the same time they installed the bike lanes leading businesses to think it was the bike lanes that reduced parking keeping customers away, when in reality, now the bike lanes are the only way to travel downtown and spend a whole day shopping and eating with paying >$25 and likely getting a ticket because you paid for another hour two minutes after your first ran out of time, and even though you had a parking receipt on your car they ticket you $60 retroactively for the two minutes you missed. The fuck is running this show when we already have committees of concerned citizens with data to help the city make decisions that they still ignore?

You’re taking statistics of an entire population including, children, elderly, sick, people in hospital, or not mentally well enough to work, and then you are going to compare that to the suicide rate of able and working people on one single company, in order to claim... and correct me if I’m wrong, that their suicide rate there was about the global average, so we shouldn’t be alarmed? 

Do you have any comparable statistics with other companies this size of working employees? Because someone working with a wage should be MUCH less likely to want to kill themselves than a junkie with no resume or income, and so your “STATISTICS” are highly biased.

The phrase in the Bible “Turn the other cheek” literally refers to the fact that if you get slapped in the face, instead of slapping back, Jesus wants you to turn your head and allow your assailant to hit you on the other side of the face as well. This rule does not become relaxed as you get older, and should especially apply to the Human conduit for the voice of GOD. There is no suffering on Earth that can compare to the suffering of eternal damnation, and the fucking Pope has to be a perfect role model and leading example for others to look up to. 

Age does not matter when the soul is eternal.

Also I do not believe in god, these are not my rules, these are the rules laid out by the Catholic Church itself, I’m just pointing out their hypocrisy.

If the Pope truly is the voice of GOD, I guess he had him on hold at that particular moment."

Winnipeg,fdbkpus,t3_ekau02,1578258285.0,"This is a weird side note, but people are so afraid of downtown because “look at all the stats about violent crime! I don’t want to open up portage and main because nobody should be walking down there!” But most of violent crime is domestic, it happens inside homes by people the victims know, and stranger dangers are reduced by having more people walking around to prevent crime. 

I feel I have to note this because seeing the downtown core as a red spot on a map can make anyone not want to go there, when the reality of danger for an individual is highly overstated and the best way to reduce it is by participating it the local economy, it can be a slippery slope to abandoning what could be a thriving community.

I say this because I have worked downtown for almost 10 years and I have never felt attacked or victimized. Approached for smokes, uncomfortable about the poverty, and annoyed at the aggressive pan handlers, but never felt targeted from a violent crime, unless you count the rich assholes who get drunk during jets games, they have tried to instigate some shit. The other thing that’s skewing the stats is that the downtown core has a much much higher volume of people than any other area so of course there will be a higher volume of crime, but that doesn’t mean you have a higher chance of being targeted."
