I thought for sure they’d have added more today, but nope! I wonder if they’re updating the app or something?"
Choices,ff9bwl4,t1_ff8u86e,1579709447.0,"Sorry, I didn’t mean to imply you thought it was better! I was just saying that for me the two wlw stories on there are hard to play because of the artwork. Like their newer stories look really nice, and they’ve been going back and updating the styles for older stories, but they haven’t redone the lgbt ones or released any newer ones."

I’ve actually read some decently written hetero stories on Chapters, but their LGBTQ section hasn’t had new content in years, and they haven’t even updated the animation style  for them like they have for a lot of their other older books."

Lovestruck,ff7z3f7,t1_ff7w0p6,1579661806.0,Ok cool! Andi is the next route I planned to get into once I caught up on Juliette’s. I like that her surname in her bio just says “???” I’m hoping the rest of the team gets let in on that secret. Big secret reveals are one of my favorite plot elements!

Another time he was running up the stairs with a long bully stick, holding it vertically for some reason, and the end not in his mouth got caught on a step and...well you get the idea. He was fine, but he waited a long time to try eating that one again, and never carried it on the stairs again."

I had forgotten the specifics of the Oracle scene, but the future premonitions made me think of >!choosing whether or not to ally with Theodosia. Thankfully, if my guess is right, rejecting the alliance so that Annalisa is free to be with Percival sounds like it would lead to the peaceful outcome (since that’s the option I’m choosing), and choosing the arranged marriage to Hector would somehow lead to war.!<"

switcharoo,fdsyx3f,t1_f4wzz0k,1578709755.0,"Here is [the original roo ](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ia0ij/watching_fellowship_of_the_ring_tonight_and_never/c2242tn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that OP linked in a different comment. [Here is the Know Your Meme explanation](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-old-reddit-switch-a-roo) but basically a switcharoo is when someone switches the obvious, but not clearly stated, topic of a post/other comment with something else from the same post/other comment. 

For example, in the original, the post was implying that Snookie looked like an Uruk-hai from Lord of the Rings. The switcharoo comment talked about how mean it is to make fun of someone’s looks, stating that the Uruk-hai looked nothing like that monster (Snookie). 

Now when someone finds a switcharoo comment in a different sub they reply with a link to the newest roo on this sub, naming it something relevant to one of the things being switched, thus creating a new link in the switcharoo chain, then share it here so that the next person can continue the chain. 

I came to this post looking for the original because I wanted to figure out how the usual replies to a switcharoo came about. Still not sure when the, “Hold my (something related to the current switcharoo), I’m going in,” got started, but a reply to the original roo included the sentence, “Hi future people,” which is the reply that follows the “hold my” one.

Edit: added the Know Your Meme link"

Lovestruck,fdoubec,t1_fdotwi0,1578613047.0,"See I was thinking the older stories were the ones that let you select previous chapters from the season you’re on. Cuz I have that option in [Razi’s route](https://imgur.com/gallery/5MAhARM). 

Damn, I wanted to restart and make a different choice in the Juliette chapter I’m on before moving forward in the season."
Lovestruck,fdotrbk,t1_fdotkjw,1578612682.0,No. Is that the difference? Cuz in some of the stories that I haven’t finished a season I still get a drop down option for the episodes. It’ll let me select the current chapter and any chapter I’ve finished in that season.

Lovestruck,fdosr6o,t1_fdfsbm6,1578612047.0,Not every story has a chapter selector though. Like right now I want to restart the chapter I’m playing for Juliette but the only drop down option is for the seasons.

SapphoAndHerFriend,fdhavbn,t1_fdgvjhu,1578419078.0,"Good. He seems awful. Aside from the general arrogance he gives off, I also heard he used dead rats to “prank” his costars and to get into character. I have two pet rats and they’re so sweet and loving. They’re very similar to cats and dogs."
