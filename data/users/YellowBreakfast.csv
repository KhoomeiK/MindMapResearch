This helped me to back off a bit on my ""convictions"". Enabling me to be open to the prospect of being wrong and not having to be ""right"" all the time. I try not to hold dearly to most ideas or what I think I ""know"" so I don't miss evidence showing me I'm wrong.

Words of advice:

1. You don't pick you parents.
2. You don't have to like your parents.
3. When you are an adult, you set the rules.
4. Don't be afraid to cut ties if you have to.
5. It's OK to get therapy.

You are not responsible for your mother's actions or behavior.  Especially as a minor, being present is not condoning how she acts.

You may love her, but you don't have to like how she acts or even like her as a human being.

Once you're out of the house, IF you still want a relationship set rules/boundaries and stick to them.   
Try going out to eat, but make it clear you will leave her there if she pulls her normal shit. Try a restaurant you're not likely to go to again if shit goes south. If she act's up walk out and don't call/talk to her for a while. It just might teach her a lesson. If not at least you tried.

I don't know her but she sound's allot like my wife's mom was (a real narcissistic POS). She may try to bring you down or manipulate you once you're out. Do not be afraid to walk away if you want. Don't let her horrible existence infect what you are trying to build. Don't feel guilty if you have to go that route.

I don't know how bad she is overall. Maybe she's just like this in public, maybe she fucks with you too. Just know if you need help dealing with it or coming to terms with it, it's totally OK to find someone to talk to about it. Therapy can work wonders and help you if you need it. Nothing to feel ashamed about."
