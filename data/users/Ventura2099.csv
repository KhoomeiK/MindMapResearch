techsupport,ff9zrcv,t3_erzm8g,1579724975.0,"Ahh I've been having the same problem with mine and the solution that I found was to:
Be careful about updating the driver. Some users have problems with most recent updates. 
Don't change anything on the driver settings. 
Don't use those gaming profiles. Use standard. 
Uncheck most of those default options that come enabled on adrenaline. The only thing I leave checked is the freesync. 

That did it for me. Problems never again."
toastme,ff8voue,t3_es6gq4,1579697665.0,"""When something bad happens you have three choices. You can either let it define you, let is destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you.""

You chose to strengthen you. Being sad after such turmoil is only natural. Anyone that tells you otherwise has probably never been in such situation. 

Keep going. You'll find happiness again."

All in all, I do appreciate his opinions."
StarWars,feqrn2k,t3_eqej9x,1579345216.0,"The acting and directing are atrocious. They also misunderstood what SW was about.

Obi-Wan using desert clothes? That's the Jedi uniform.
Luke is too old to train!? Must mean a Jedi is trained since they are infants. 
They didn't expand the Force but rather contained within  midchlorians

They missed showing how corruption from within destroyed the Republic and the Jedi. How there was an army, then the clones came later (so it would made sense to have human beings as Moffs layer and people that actually got involved in the war)

AotC is soooo boring. Anakins and padme love is so forced. The Jedi are terrible strategists. Nothing fits.

The fat chick/guy might be that way by a gazillion reasons and you only mande yourself feel good when you shove that to their faces.

It feels like a video for himself rather than - what I think was the idea - be honest about yourself and don't hide behind masks... Although, politicians and celebrities would probably argue the opposite, if they were able to lose the mask."
