Purity tests in general are why we are here.   Ideologically pure people don't float to the top.  Its the people willing to sacrifice their beliefs to wrap themselves in a facade of purity.  If they're willing to do that, they are then willing to do anything for power."

But then none of them can be bothered to reach out to see if there was a reason she was shaved or offer friendly advice to you.

She is still a qtpie."

A room blocked by a gate to keep the dog out, probably where their litter box is kept and things they can perch on/use to enter/exit a room safely out of the doggos reach and lord over their kingdom (desks/shelves etc).

The other is the energy level of the dog.  Strive to put yourself between the cat and dog until the dog is calm, every time they see each other.  If the doggo is calm every time he sees the cat, the cat will feel safer.  You're teaching the dog that cats aren't excitement time."
