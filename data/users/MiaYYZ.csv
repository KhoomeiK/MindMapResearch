If they didn’t, average citizens would be forced to sell their homes because they couldn’t afford their property taxes, which is inequitable."
todayilearned,fci8pg4,t1_fci7ogt,1577659106.0,"Agreed, and a week after the decision was released a libertarian named Logan Darrow Clements, proposed that Justice Souter’s land be seized so he could build a hotel on it. This, he said, would increase the value of both the property and the land around it — in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision.

“The proposed development, called ‘The Lost Liberty Hotel’ will feature the ‘Just Desserts Café’ and include a museum, open to the public, featuring a permanent exhibit on the loss of freedom in America. Instead of a Gideon’s Bible each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged,’’ said a news release announcing Clements’ plan.

“The hotel must be built on this particular piece of land because it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans.’’"

todayilearned,fci5cuf,t1_fchzwcl,1577657957.0,"It’s called Eminent Domain, and if the property will be used for a ‘public use’ most municipalities in the developed world have the right to force the sale at fair market value. The US Supreme Court took a really broad interpretation of ‘public use’ in Kelo v New London when they allowed the city to condemn properties so that a private developer could build commercial properties on the land. Their reasoning was that the new properties would have a much higher property tax basis that would benefit the city as a whole, which is a really controversial interpretation."

If farmland is zoned Ag and a developer buys it with plans to build condos, he takes the risk that the county commission won’t allow the property to be rezoned M-20 (ie 20 multi family units per acre), and he has to pay to hold the property (taxes and insurance) while the rezoning process works its way through the design review board and the various other oversight committees, plus the cost of architecture and legal counsel etc."
