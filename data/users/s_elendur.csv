Get a copy of amazing slow downer, its software
Load the song in the software and do it note by note. Or you could cheat and find the sheet music by looking it up on musescore, or cheat by seeing if anyone posted chords to the song. musescore will give you arrangements done by other people, chord lookup will give you a reference. Your end product doesnt have to be perfect. It doesnt take much to make a song recognizable and thats all you really need."
piano,fdgzir5,t1_fdgvsgu,1578412079.0,"My practice right now is all over the place. I am pretty knowledgeable in theory, but not in practical application. IE, i can make any chord, know several ways of voicing them, additional notes you can play with them, etc, but have no clue how to take that, apply it to a lead sheet and play something that sounds ""nice"" other than just doing basic block chords in the left hand with melody on top. some songs you can get away with doing that (ie, jar of hearts from the real pop book, the scientist by coldplay) but others, meh. I know nothing of ornamentation, timing most likely needs work (dabbled in funk and r&b, swing is not my strong suit. i can ""feel"" it but have troubles playing it. i just feel like everything i do is so, well, plain and not worthy of people listening."

Now i'm trying to learn jazz/funk with the intention of getting the the point where I can get paid for playing. I have practiced and practiced and practice but I feel like I can't get beyond basics. How do people get from an intermediate/beginning level to being good enough where people would pay to hear them play?"
piano,fde96t5,t3_ekx6rc,1578333934.0,"Hi, i havent done battery powered but a few days ago i wastched a video by a pianist who was testing taking a casio cgp 700 portable using an uninterupted power supply, they type they use for computer. He got 2 hours of play on the lower quality version of the system he was using. When im home ill link the video so you could see the specific make and modem of the ups he was testing  if you want.

*edit* i only bring this up because i dont trust batteries to play for a good amount of time. People are saying they get 5 hours of play time but for 8 batteries that you have to recharge/buy new the price will add up quickly ."
stevenuniverse,fd77hpn,t1_fd74eba,1578200434.0,"You don't need to constantly update friends on your life, but check-in within two months would be more than reasonable for a close friend to do. Hell, Lars knew about Shep, so at some point in time while Sadie was on tour Lars and Sadie connected, had a conversation about the new relationship with shep, to the point where lars is asking about how shep was doing. We have seen Steven visit Connie, and Bismuth, and Lapis and Peridot within those two months. It's not as though steven doesn't check in on people. He asked connie about college prep/space camp/ whatever was going on with her whenever he visited. He got updates on little homeworld when he went and say peridot and them. He found out about Amethyst finding jobs for gems at little homeworld rather quickly, just by going out and talking to her. It probably was within two months of her doing that. However, Steven apparently has never asked Lars ""hey, how are things going between you and Sadie?"" in that timeframe? He's had 2 years to ask about this, but he was completely in the dark at the point of the episode. This is why I say they aren't close friends. And you want to call them shitty because they didn't talk to him about his feelings while they were about to be crushed by a pink bubble? If thats the case, maybe Steven is the shitty one for not reaching out to his peoples over the course of two years to talk to them about how things are going in their life?"
stevenuniverse,fd736ti,t1_fd71rvc,1578198861.0,"you say i have a limited view on what friendship is. no, i never said they weren't friends. i just said they aren't close friends. the fact is, different cultures have different feelings on what constitutes friendships or what is a close friendship. it is probably just a difference in how we view these things. i'm in my 30s, so i have learned a lot of these lessons myself. Friends don't always consider you a close friend even if you do. It takes time to nuture a relationship for a friendship to remain as close as it was. People change. people drift away. Doesn't make them crappy.

i dont think anyone was acting crappy except for Steven. Yes, Shep was the one to talk to Steven, but that doesn't mean everyone else was shitty because they didn't turn around and give him a hug or talk to him about his feelings."
stevenuniverse,fd6yqww,t1_fd6v2dy,1578197379.0,"Of the people you mentioned earlier, I wouldn't consider a lot of them ""close"" friends of steven. They are friends, sure, but not close. Peridot, Lapis, and Bismuth are for sure friends of his, but are they *close*? The only person I would put on the ""close"" friends list would probably be Connie. Well, and maybe Lapis.

Lars is not a confidant of Stevens, Connie is. And while steven can also confide in the CGs, they are more so family.  That doesn't mean he's not friends with these people, just that these aren't people he would go to in a time of need. I'm guessing you're a lot younger than I am, but yeah, there is a big difference between ""close friends"", and ""friends."" Most people only have one or two close friends. That doesn't mean they only have one or two friends, but they only have one or two people they feel that if they needed to reach out to, they could do so. I don't think if Steven was going through something, neither Lars or Sadie would be someone he would go to to look for advice.

As for what happened during the situation, everyone involved was more concerned about the fact that they were about to die, but you want Lars/Sadie to stop and talk about Steven's feelings at the moment? Things don't work like that. They both explained to Steven  ""hey, we tried to reconnect, it didn't work"" and this made the situation worse.  Steven wasn't hearing any of that from them. Which is why Shep was needed as an outsider to point out the obvious which EVERYONE saw from the get-go. Have you never had a situation where someone gave you advice but they were too close to the situation at hand for you to take their word for it, only to have a third party make the exact same point so that you realize, um, ok, maybe the other person was right. Even if Sadie and Lars had said the exact same things Shep said, it would have most likely not done anything at all to change the situation. Why, because he already felt abandoned  by them in the first place."
stevenuniverse,fd6t747,t1_fd6o522,1578195407.0,"Just because two people go through an experience together doesn't automatically make them ""close friends"" Sure, their friendship has grown due to common experiences, but that doesn't mean that they are close. I'm not saying they aren't closer than two strangers, my point has been that Lars isn't as close to Steven as Steven thinks he is. Yes, they went through experiences together, but in the two years after how much investment did Steven put into maintaining the friendship? I'm going to bet it's been little if any, so they grew apart. Even if they were close friends at the time when Lars got back to earth, that does NOT mean they were still close friends two years later. I never said Steven and Lars were not friends at all, i said they weren't **close** friends. This episode shows that although Steven has a lot of friends, many of them aren't close. He knew NOTHING of what was going on with the cool kids. He knew NOTHING of what was going on with Lars or Sadie. Granted, private things are private, but not one of them mentioned in passing any of this. This is why I say they weren't **close** friends. I have friends I reconnect with maybe once every few months, but I do make sure to take the time to ask how they are doing, what's new since the last time we spoke, etc. I make an effort to try and hang out with them because in order to maintain a friendship, you have to nurture it. What happened doesn't mean Lars or Sadie or Jenny or Buck or Sour Cream are bad people, it just shows that Steven has grown apart. No one was awful except for Steven who got overwhelmed by people going on with their lives despite him not being involved."
stevenuniverse,fd6lzwe,t1_fd5qr86,1578192939.0,"But was lars and sadie truly close friends of steven? Up until lars literally died and steven brought him back to life he was never close with steven. His relationship with steven was guy who sells him pastries. Most times theyve interacted, it was never because lars wanted to hang out with steven, it was because they just happen to be in the same company as one another. Lars hung out with steven largely in an effort to get to know the cool kids. Sure, steven would try to help lars out, but that doesnt mean lars thought the same of how close they were. How many times did steven try to hug lars only to be dismissed each and every time. Sure, they got closer by the time lars was with the off colors, but that doesnt mean they were besties or anything. And as this episode shows theyve grown apart. Has steven interacted with lars outside of buying food from him since lars got back? Granted, we dont know but the answer is most likely not.

Also, they did talk to steven in that episode. They explained what happened after and correctly pointed out that what happened was their private business. Even before that, lars asked if steven was ok, steven choose not to express his concerns. Shep was there because as i said, as an outsider, they have no enotional investment to steven and can point out the obvious."
stevenuniverse,fd5kfus,t1_fd5heuy,1578178500.0,"It wasn't about them not talking to him, they didn't see or recognize what was going on. Sometimes it takes someone not involved with a situation to be able to do that. However, I wonder, why do you think they were close friends? Especially at the time of the episode. 

Think about this. Steven didn't know ANYTHING about what was happening with anyone. No one reached out to steven to tell him of things going on in their life. Nor does steven reach out to them to let them know what he's been going through. All my closest friends, when they start dating someone new I know within, what, a few weeks. Sadie was dating Shep for two months. No mention of that to him what so ever. No mention of whats her name Jenny sewing jackets for phones, no mention to him that buck was thinking about or applying to medical school. None of that. When he was dealing with his feelings towards the gems, instead of calling a friend to talk about it, he instead reaches out to sentient plant life. Yes, he did hang out with them a few times, but I think calling them ""close"" friends is stretching it. A lot. 

I feel like this is part of a larger theme going on in the show. We have had episodes dealing with Steven's desire to help and the fact that it probably isn't best for steven to always ""help"" someone as people can manage on their own without his input. There has been an ongoing theme of change in the Future episodes."
stevenuniverse,fd5fts9,t1_fd5deh7,1578177233.0,"They weren't close friends though. Maybe early on there were closer than they are now, but people fall apart, and being that Steven is, what 16 now, that is going to happen more often now. Steven was on Homeworld for 2 years. How much did he try to keep up his friendships while he was dealing with Gem related things?  Friendships take time to build and nurture. 

During the episode, they did update him on what they were doing, and that is what caused the problem. It took an outsider to recognize what was going on with Steven because no one else realized how much changes to their personal lives affected him. He felt hurt that people are moving on so he mentally created a wall to stop anything from changing. 

Their reactions don't make them awful friends, that just means they've moved on from the friendship. It happens. 

I struggle with this myself, right now I'm trying to reconnect with a few friends that I used to be close to a few years ago. However, I realize people are busy with their personal lives, and those lives go on even if I don't text/call/speak to them for a month. If they don't give me a verbal dump of every issue they have with their significant other like we used to talk 5 years ago, so be it. I catch up every few months, but I don't think of them as awful people because things aren't the same as they were a few years ago."
stevenuniverse,fd5bv0y,t1_fd4pqo0,1578176049.0,"i don't think they were awful to him. i think this episode kinda showed how steven's friends aren't close friends. he has acquaintances. people that he sees around the city, that will say hi and bye to him and even hang out with him every now and then, but not people that will speak with him or hang out with him. After all, he knew nothing of the band breaking up, Sadie dating Shep, Lars going into space, the phone jacket business, buck going to medical school, sour cream gigging in Capital city, none of that. I mean, of my friends, the ones I am closer with I do ask them how they are when I speak to them and they generally mention things like a new love interest, new job, a change of venue for them when it comes to what they are doing for themselves. Steven does *know* of these people, but he doesn't ***know*** *know* them. Both Lars and Sadie tried to explain that what happened between them was personal, and Steven wasn't privy to that. They aren't like close friends of his. Why would they talk to him?"

todayilearned,fbxod14,t1_fbx76p3,1577195759.0,i just saw a video on youtube about this. apparently those people could be on call 24-7 and have to at the drop of a hat stop what they are doing and fly out to the nearest airport to donate blood if someone needs it.  i think a few of them donate their blood to themselves pretty frequently to keep on store in case they need it.
