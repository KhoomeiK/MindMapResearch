I’ve moved to different parts of the country like 4 or 5 times, all of which were in the wake of dramatic life where I just needed to peace the fuck out.

These days I’m challenging myself to confront issues head on. I still like to take trips and peace out sometimes, but am choosing to go within and deal with my shit."

I loved Kapitari, and ones like it, because they are ran by the natives there, and by people who really care about your overall experience."
