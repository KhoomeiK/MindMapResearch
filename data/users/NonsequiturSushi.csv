politics,feh4y1o,t1_fegxjcq,1579109233.0,"This is what I've been saying, too.  I think the allegation is very suspect because it goes counter to Bernie's past positions and statements.

The allegation came from staffers for Warren, and she hadn't made any comments on it before the debate.  I thought maybe she would make a statement clarifying things.

When asked about Bernie's alleged comment at the debate, she had the opportunity to either say ""yes he said that"" or ""no, he didn't say that."" I respect Warren, and would believe what she said either way.

What she did was supply a wishy washy answer, neither confirming or denying that Bernie said this during there meeting. To me, this implies that Bernie didn't make these comments. If he did,  Warren would say so, and it would be beneficial to her primary campaign.  If Bernie didn't say these comments, Warren can still damage Bernie by not confirming or denying.

TLDR: Warren wants the cake and to eat it too."

I know he was swimming way against the current when it came to his involvement with my older siblings and me.  My dad's  parents basically shipped him off to boarding school as soon as they could, and he vowed to raise his kids differently.  I saw the differences with my dad and my friends' dads.  

Today, I'm a millennial dad and I look to my own father as a role model of how to be an involved and available dad.  I'm glad the tide is changing so that this style of fatherhood becoming the standard.

Edit: boomer dad, not boner dad, lol"

PublicFreakout,fcyk0w5,t1_fcyhpfe,1578081392.0,">Reputation to these places is worth more than almost anything.

Absolutely correct, any manager worth their salt is going to get rid of this guy and side 100% with the guest.

The funny thing is, this policy has unintended consequences.  When I worked at a place like this, me and my colleagues would bury any guest complaints before they made it to managers and supervisors.

coolguides,fcu8moe,t1_fcu759r,1577975145.0,"The difference between colleges and universities in the US are not that distinct.  Both offer undergraduate degrees (BS and BA), but universities in the US also have graduate programs.  Lots of US students will get their undergraduate degree from a college and join a graduate University for a master's or doctorate.

We don't consider the colleges to be less prestigious education or a technical training.  In Europe the distinction is more pronounced, with colleges offering more of a trade education.

This is a gross overgeneralization, but I hope that helps break it down."
