amateurradio,fdhr6fd,t1_fdhkahs,1578428565.0,"It's more a matter of your needs and your restrictions.  Most people can't put up an 80M Yagi, due to the height required (at least 1/2 wavelength above ground) or acreage to set it up.  If you don't require movable directivity, then you can use any number of configurations that are fixed in their installation.  Some people decide they're only interested in trying to work stations in a given direction, and just set up their antenna for that.  Others have a small lot, so they bend and manipulate their antenna to fit, then use a tuner to get an acceptable match.  There are tradeoffs all over the place; it's worth spending some time learning about antennae before you decide what to put up."
amateurradio,fdh56kz,t3_eld68y,1578415620.0,"If you've ever heard of a ham band referred to as ""40 meters"" - i.e. 7 MHz, that's an indication of the wavelength.  A 7 MHz signal will travel approximately 40 meters over the duration of one cycle.  The lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength, and the longer (larger) the antenna needs to be to transmit efficiently.  Conversely, the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength, and the shorter (smaller) the antenna needs to be."

* Height - Height at the withers for dogs ranges from 12½ to 13½ inches and bitches 11½ to 12½ inches. Minor variations may be seen; however, more important is the proportion.
* Proportion - The relationship of height to length of body, as measured from the prosternum to the rearmost portion of the buttocks, should be 2:3.

So, do a quick measure of your pupper.  If he's taller, or the proportion is off, then he's more likely to be a mix."
