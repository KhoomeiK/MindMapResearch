EnglishLearning,ffjvth0,t3_eu0rdy,1580008333.0," A country's economic growth or how developed a country is, is completely ascertained by the infrastructure and many other factors. Some countries that are economically very rich are getting more rich, on the other hand poor countries are getting more poor/poorer. The reasons behind this vary based on many factors, including natural resources, style of living, and social structures. Other countries that are economically very rich could help underdeveloped countries in many ways. 

&#x200B;

 Some countries are more developed than others because they are gifted with abundant natural resources and they have to rely on other countries for minimal amounts of imported goods. For instance, in the middle-east countries like Saudi Arabia have an abundance of oil that they sell to the other countries that don't have oil resources. The revenue from selling the oil is accounted for 85% of the country's income. Moreover, the style of living in developed countries is better than in unprivileged ones. In such countries, crime rates are lower, and the government helps people with medication and schooling. Such things attract people from the foreign countries to migrate, which consequently helps countries become richer as the newly migrated people would contribute in circulating money around the country by making purchases. 

&#x200B;

 On the other hand, poor countries probably have no natural resources to help in its development, which makes it totally dependent on imports from foreign countries. Thus, countries spend more money on buying foreign goods, resulting in less spending inside the country, which delays it's development. For instance, instead of spending money on imports it could invest in schools, hospitals, or other social services to help people. Therefore, having no natural resources is one of the biggest liabilites a country could face, and constantly makes it poorer. Furthermore, social structures in an underdeveloped country also play a vital role in its development. For instance, if a country is notorious for having terrorism, then crime rates would obviously be very high, hurting tourism. Thus, social structure plays a very important role in the development of a country. 

&#x200B;

 Many things can be done to help countries become richer. Developed countries should invest in underdeveloped countries to eradicate terrorism, which is stopping a country from developing further. Moreover, help building new schools could help in educating students, resulting in people getting better jobs.
