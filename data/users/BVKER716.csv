UBreddit,ffq8qtb,t1_ffm9swy,1580126178.0,"Best tip I have to get going is just try to step on to the board with some forward momentum (YouTube might be able today describe that better than me, sorry lol) and make sure you’re only pushing with your back foot. It’s easier to keep your balance, and you’ll avoid any potential shit for pushing mongo too lol.

What board do you have? Deck sizes fluctuate based on the width of the board—most people ride 7.5” to 8.25”—and it can make a huge difference when you’re learning how to skate if you use a smaller board.

What wheels do you have? People generally use wheels in the range of 50-59mm. Smaller wheels are nice for skating street or in a park, whereas bigger wheels will be smoother and a lot easier when you’re learning how to ride.

Look at your wheels and see if there’s a number on them (it’ll just say “54” or something), that’s the size in millimeters.

Definitely check out the Peace Park near campus when the weather is clear"
UBreddit,ffpnroi,t3_euhvom,1580099763.0,"The best advice I have for making friends or acquaintances can be used anywhere in life.  Try to find a group (or place) that’s related to something that truly interests you, and talk to other like-minded individuals. This gives you something to talk about initially because you both share one common belief/hobby/interest, and once you begin a conversation it’s pretty easy to transition to more topics based on how the convo is flowing.


The hardest part of meeting new people is taking the first step and initiating a conversation with someone, that’s like 95% of the process in my opinion. If you find it challenging to hold a convo with a stranger, try to keep the topic related to them (without being too blatant about it) because people naturally love talking about themselves (and their own interests)."

UBreddit,ffkvdjc,t3_eu1on7,1580029665.0,"The best advice I can give you is to go to a skatepark, or somewhere that has flatland without cracks, to practice riding. You’re also more likely to ride over small cracks if you’re riding faster, so the consistency will come with more practice as you get more comfortable on the board.

It’s a great age to start letting children make decisions like that, and it also says a lot about the child’s character at that age.


That’s why I recommended buying him something he has had his eye on. He still spent the money, but there’s nothing wrong with encouraging the positive behavior by getting him something and letting him know how thoughtful the initial act was. It’s not uncommon for people to reciprocate the favor in the future (e.g. “I owe you one”)"

People really went hard with the table smashing for a couple years– it still happens a lot, but not as frequently.  A couple years back somebody was in the 300 section and fell over the railing, pretty sure they were okay but I was surprised. Throwing a dildo onto the field when we played the Patriots was pretty hilarious the first time someone did it.

We were projected to go 6-10 this year, I think? We have now reached the playoffs for the second time within three years. Or, if you want it to really get that point across, this was our second playoff game in two decades.

The coaching staff, players, and this organization are really coming together. In my opinion, this is only the beginning. Our team is young, they are really building chemistry together, and it would be foolish to say that they haven’t made consistent progress as a team over the last two seasons.
