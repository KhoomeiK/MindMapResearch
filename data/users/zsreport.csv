Montana,ffiashg,t1_ffi8436,1579969427.0,"There's also an issue of sexual predators who aren't members of any Tribes, especially in areas near ""man camps"" and truck stops. Due to the jurisdictional issues (tribes don't have little to no jurisdiction over non-tribal members, meaning overworked FBI regional offices are usually the primary law enforcement) and the mobility of these predators it's hard to track them down.

Since the 1970s, sexual predators have moved heavily in the direction of targeting women who are too often seen by society as ""throwaways"" - prostitutes, runaways, drug users, and, generally, women from the lower rungs of our socioeconomic classes. So when one of these women disappears, it takes a lot of effort to get law enforcement involved, at least until a body is found, often by then so much time has passed since her death there's not a lot of useful evidence."
