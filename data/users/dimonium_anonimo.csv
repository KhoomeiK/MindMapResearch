IdiotsInCars,ffbwkgz,t1_ffanf1b,1579785134.0,"It is entirely the merging lane car's job to merge in a way that does not interfere with the traffic they are merging into. It is never the main road car's job to get out of there way. People do it to be nice, when there's plenty of room on the road. There was not plenty of room, and it looks like the dark truck had to be in the right lane at the next intersection anyway.

The dark colored truck doesn't look like it speeds up to try and be a dick. It looks like it's going a constant speed and then has to try to avoid the white truck. The white truck had the yield sign which means if the dark truck had to avoid the white truck, the white truck failed at merging.

""It's not practical"" I don't know what You're trying to get at, but practical or not, that's the law. If white truck can't find a space big enough, then they have to wait. That's what yield means. Or alternatively, they could have stayed in that lane, lost a few minutes getting back, and tried again or tried another route.

OP says both are idiots... I don't think I agree. Dark truck doesn't look to me like they're being a dick or holding their ground for no reason. It looks to me like the white truck tried to illegally force them out of the lane they needed to be in."

I thought I had a handle on how energetic it was, and so felt safe using a blowtorch, but probably a combination of the most I lit off at once and the leaves helping compress it made it go off in my face.

The best way I can explain how someone is not allowed to leave the inside lane is when the outside lane has the option to go straight or turn left and stay in the roundabout. The inside lane can't leave their lane without making a dangerous situation.

Check out westbound (wanting to turn around) or southbound traffic (wanting to turn left) both have the opportunity to enter that inside lane that shows up at the 10:00-11:00 position. This lane does not have the right to leave the roundabout to the South. So any traffic eastbound on Northland has the right to enter the outside lane in order to leave eastbound even if there's a car in the inside lane."

IdiotsInCars,fe3zgfz,t1_fe3y413,1578854313.0,"Not every car has a choice in a roundabout. Some cars are forced to leave or stay in the roundabout depending on which lane they're in. Letting everyone else go first is not how roundabouts were designed to work. They were designed to let multiple people go at the same time... When it's safe to do so. Just like the rule You stated. SOMETIMES, NOT ALL TIMES, it is safe to enter a roundabout when a car in the inside lane is coming around to Your entrance. That sometimes is when they are forced to stay in the roundabout and You are entering the outside lane. This happens every day in my hometown. There's a 2-lane roundabout, the inside lane has to go left. The outside lane is safe to enter even if the inside lane is full all the way around."
IdiotsInCars,fe3xazz,t1_fe3ufju,1578853702.0,"If You had read my example at a stoplight You would realize that yield means give way to SOME cars. Not all. In fact, yield only to the cars that could collide with You if You were to go. Not all cars at an intersection (roundabout or not) will collide with You. For instance, it is completely legal to make a full 360° turn in a roundabout. Or 720° or keep going round and round till You decide where to go or run out of gas. By saying You mist yield to every car in the roundabout means to wait until the roundabout is completely clear before entering. Even if there is one car in the roundabout, and he just passed You, You have to wait for him to leave, because what if he decides to go around again? He'll have crossed where Your path is about to go. A roundabout is specifically designed to let multiple people go at the same time. So You change Your statement to say yield to everyone in the roundabout, say for instance, if they are in the 90° before Your entrance. And I say, well that's arbitrary, why don't You just yield to the people that could collide with You only. And You agree, and I point out that 2 people can drive side by side in a roundabout if there are 2 lanes, and You agree. And then I say so is there ever a scenario where someone has to stay in the inside lane. And You think for a minute and say no because that would prove me right. And I say, what happens if the outside lane is allowed to choose between straight or left at a certain exit of the roundabout? Wouldn't the inside lane have to turn left otherwise there'd be a collision any time the inside lane went straight and the outside lane went left at the same time. And You say, well surely no roundabout allows for the outside lane to turn left. And I say they do, my whole town is plastered with them. Now You must realize that there are scenarios where it is safe to enter a roundabout when there's a car in the inside lane."
IdiotsInCars,fe3oze0,t1_fe3mm1p,1578851482.0,"Yield does not mean let everyone else go first. It means if there would be a collision between two cars, let the other car go first. If there will be no collision, there is no need to yield. Listen. If you have a green light and oncoming traffic has a green light but the left turn lane is the only lane with cars in it, You don't have to yield to them, You make an assumption that they are turning left and there will not be a collision thus no need to yield (this is when You say there's no assumption, they are turning left and I say, You clearly haven't been around this subreddit long enough if You think being in a left turn lane guarantees they're turning left, or that lack of a turn signal means they're going straight. We make assumptions ALL. THE. TIME. on the road. We have to). There's a difference with the roundabout: in the roundabout, the inside lane had a choice to go straight or turn. Not all roundabouts are like that. I know because my town is full of them. In fact, the only time I see the style of roundabout in the video is when I leave town. I don't know what was in their head. I don't know if they're from the area or not. I don't know what the area they're actually from is like. They're an idiot, they're 100% at fault for this situation. Even if every roundabout they've ever encountered was the same, it's always safer to enter a new roundabout over-cautiously. What I am arguing is that it is possible to see a scenario where the assumption I described was logical... Wrong, and dangerous yes, but logical."
IdiotsInCars,fe3jnn3,t1_fe3ech7,1578849845.0,"I mean, fair point, the green signs do eliminate the possibility of the cammer misunderstanding the rules of this roundabout, but not the other vehicle. He can't see what the cammer saw on the other entrance to the roundabout. So he's an idiot for making an assumption and then entering the roundabout based on an incorrect assumption. However, if his assumption were correct, the yield sign would have been redundant because the only car in the roundabout he'd have to worry about was in the inside lane... I guess I'm also assuming the idiot made the assumption the inside lane had to turn, and not that he's just an asshole who doesn't care about anybody else but himself. That's always a possibility. I just wish Americans were introduced to roundabouts more slowly. Maybe only single lane roundabouts for a decade, then slowly add in 1 standardized style of 2-lane roundabouts for another decade, and then generalized multi-lane roundabouts. Instead, we went whole hog and just put whatever we want wherever we want it. And while it has dramatically reduced the number of lethal collisions, it has even more dramatically increased the number of minor fender benders."
IdiotsInCars,fe2xdqu,t3_en8s0s,1578843940.0,"There are two options for 2 lane roundabouts. Either the outside lane leaves the roundabout only and the inside lane has the option to leave or keep going. Or the inside lane has to stay in the roundabout and the outside lane has the option to leave or keep going. Until You are familiar with a particular roundabout, it's almost impossible to tell which because the markings for it are all in the roundabout itself. It looks like this guy thought it was the latter and didn't know the cammer had the option to exit... Or, I suppose there's always the option that the cammer thought it was the former and didn't know he had to stay in the roundabout.

Edit: it sure looks like the former based on lane lines and wear pattern, but there are no arrows showing that."

If You have carefully surveyed the situation and believe You can safely continue at Your current speed then do so and You are completely obeying the law. However, the light often appears at a busy intersection where there may be too much to take in without guaranteed right of way to determine if it's safe to go, so slowing down is always a good idea. And as of about 2015 or so in Wisconsin and some other states, a flashing turn arrow only means yield. It means the oncoming traffic has a green light and green turn arrow so people next to You can't go straight, but as long as there's a gap in oncoming straight traffic, You're allowed to go. This eliminates unnecessary red turn lights and unnecessary waiting. I wish more states would adopt this as waiting at a red turn arrow when the oncoming straight lane is empty but there are still oncoming left turners is obnoxious."
