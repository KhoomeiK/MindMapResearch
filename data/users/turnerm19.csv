LifeAdvice,ff7eafu,t1_ff7e269,1579647554.0,"I hope I will as well. It‚Äôs hard because the one person who I feel I spill these feelings to is my mom. But my mom isn‚Äôt being very strong herself. I mean we all are strong but no one seems to care anymore. And I. Would love to talk to her. But the other day i tried to talk to her about my financial situation and she just yelled at me. And told me to grow the fuck up and get a job. But it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not trying and like I haven‚Äôt worked for the last 4 years 
I don‚Äôt understand"

LifeAdvice,ff7b6oy,t1_ff7b39v,1579645266.0,It‚Äôs Scary to think that they were all like this at some point. It just took one person to pass away for you guys to show it?  I‚Äôm worried and I‚Äôm mostly scared for other people in my family. I know I‚Äôll be able to look the other way when things go bad but I know some of them will get caught up and sucked into it

depression,fcrzzws,t3_eihb2v,1577909224.0,"It‚Äôs very frustrating, it seems the people who have had hoped and dreams pass away, this guy I went to school with, was going to school out of state.

relationship_advice,fciwk8a,t3_ehabn7,1577671533.0," I really hope your wife knows what she‚Äôs doing to her as a kid, When she grows up she‚Äôs not only gonna resent her but most likely hate her. Kinda these days are smarter than most. We teach em a lot but they also get taught a lot from the outside world, people are becoming more caring more affectionate and she will find that ‚Äúmotherly‚Äù figure. If your wife doesn‚Äôt step up and try harder. 

I‚Äôm really sorry to hear about this. I‚Äôm glad you are doing your best to help the situation it hurts my heart to hear this little girl go through that."
