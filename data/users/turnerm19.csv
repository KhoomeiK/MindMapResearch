insaneparents,ffhyn90,t3_erhp6y,1579959462.0,From 12 to like 16 I could barely even hangout with someone new without meeting their parents. Including females. So at somepoint I just stopped texting back m. Stopped calling to check in. And all she could do is yell at me. Which I was fine with. At least I made it so I didn’t have her breathing down my neck the whole time. Shit like this sucks and this sub is definitely one I’ll be joining
insaneparents,ffhxq36,t3_esoaww,1579958462.0,Don’t ask next time
insaneparents,ffhwqgo,t1_ffhwn3w,1579957311.0,She’s been doing this since I was 12. We get into an argument she ignores me to the point wheee I need her for something and then I have to say sorry. She will make me feel crazy for bringing that up. Making faces like I’m lying and making things up. Like fuck you. No wonder no one likes you.
insaneparents,ffhwn3w,t3_etq18v,1579957204.0,"This is my mom. For 20 years she has been doing nothing but putting me and my siblings in a toxic environment. People, drugs, etc.. and now that everything has calmed down. Now she acts as if whenever her actual good kids or the kids that care. Do something wrong we are the worst person ever and right now she’s not talking to me. Even after she told me to grow up and get job. Like fuck  you! I’m going to school and I’ve been working since I’ve been out of highschool. Who are you to treat me and my siblings as basically tax dependants every year. And then they grow up with little to no actual emotional support from you. Abuse from you. And on top of that treating everybody in her life who treats her like shit better than her actual “kids” who treat her the best because you adopted them. But here you are driving me and even some of your biological kids away. And telling people these sob stories about how they treated you bad and how good you treated the. Fuck outta here. Hoarding, lying, greedy, just fucked up bitch!! When I leave I’m gone and I’m only talking with my siblings. Stupid ass."
college,ffhvfqp,t1_ffhvajk,1579955735.0,"What are you talking about seems fishy? It’s an automotive program. So they treat me as if I’m an actual automotive employee. So I have to buy my own tools get parts for cars that need to be fixed.  the only reason my financial aid hasn’t come in yet, is because i was late getting my tax info for the college. Lol and okay kinda just asking but you obviously answered my question. I’m not the first person to ask for help from crowdfunding but yeah"

LifeAdvice,ff7eafu,t1_ff7e269,1579647554.0,"I hope I will as well. Itâ€™s hard because the one person who I feel I spill these feelings to is my mom. But my mom isnâ€™t being very strong herself. I mean we all are strong but no one seems to care anymore. And I. Would love to talk to her. But the other day i tried to talk to her about my financial situation and she just yelled at me. And told me to grow the fuck up and get a job. But itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m not trying and like I havenâ€™t worked for the last 4 years 
I donâ€™t understand"

LifeAdvice,ff7b6oy,t1_ff7b39v,1579645266.0,Itâ€™s Scary to think that they were all like this at some point. It just took one person to pass away for you guys to show it?  Iâ€™m worried and Iâ€™m mostly scared for other people in my family. I know Iâ€™ll be able to look the other way when things go bad but I know some of them will get caught up and sucked into it

depression,fcrzzws,t3_eihb2v,1577909224.0,"Itâ€™s very frustrating, it seems the people who have had hoped and dreams pass away, this guy I went to school with, was going to school out of state. He got in an accident in that state which killed him. He was playing sports and going to school and actually probably getting somewhere. Itâ€™s crazy but here WE are. Depressed constantly.

relationship_advice,fciwk8a,t3_ehabn7,1577671533.0," I really hope your wife knows what sheâ€™s doing to her as a kid, When she grows up sheâ€™s not only gonna resent her but most likely hate her. Kinda these days are smarter than most. We teach em a lot but they also get taught a lot from the outside world, people are becoming more caring more affectionate and she will find that â€œmotherlyâ€ figure. If your wife doesnâ€™t step up and try harder. 

Iâ€™m really sorry to hear about this. Iâ€™m glad you are doing your best to help the situation it hurts my heart to hear this little girl go through that."
