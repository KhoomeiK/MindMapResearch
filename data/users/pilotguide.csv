videos,ffqiu64,t3_eum0q4,1580135800.0,Sounds like CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain). IFR flight in a helicopter can be very dangerous if you don't have situational awareness. Sounds like the pilot just flew into the hill. That's so sad.
androidapps,ffq5cna,t3_eukayh,1580121376.0,What about Hit Film Express? Worth a try if you haven't used it before. It's free... Has paid add-ons

CR10,ffln23l,t3_eu5pxy,1580041653.0,The board looks okay. But it's impossible to tell from the surface if anything is wrong with it. Solid state circuits can hide all sorts of issues. What's up with the board?
flightsim,ffgy98g,t1_ffgxlh0,1579918150.0,I haven't used either. Might be worthwhile finding some YouTube reviews... I have a second hand x-55 setup that works well for me. But everyone has their preference.
flightsim,ffgv110,t3_etk0j0,1579915769.0,You can mix and match whatever you'd like. In x-plane you're able to map things in any matter you'd like. I don't see and issue with this combo.
flightsim,ff74xe9,t1_ff64rif,1579641198.0,Hope that isn't the case. I've got a mid range system and about 10k hours on turbines. I'm holding out hope.
NovaScotia,ff5shn1,t3_errvmo,1579608550.0,"If you're looking for a slower lifestyle then the maritimes are a good fit. I've had the opportunity to work in a few remote locations in Ontario as well in Toronto. A big city centre will absolutely give you the best chances to earn an above average living. But you'd pay for it in commuting times and high cost of living. The maritimes have less opportunity but if a good relaxed lifestyle is what you want for you and your family then Nova Scotia will be a great fit. The community I live in we've seen a recent surge in immigrants becoming part of the community. It's been great! More cultural variety and new businesses opened by some of those families. You'll love it here. As for housing, you can absolutely find good deals about 40 minutes or more outside of Halifax.  Closer to the city it's expensive. Welcome home! Maybe we'll be neighbors?"
Anxiety,ff4qqjm,t3_ermpo1,1579570170.0,One of the hardest things to do. Good job on being brave!

depression,fee86d8,t1_fee79oc,1579028388.0,Tell them you were trying to protect them. That you're concerned about them as well as yourself. I cannot imagine they'd hate you for being honest that you're suffering from severe depression. It's easy to hide and difficult to be honest. But honesty is what will likely get you started towards help and recovery. I wish you the very best and hope you find the courage to be honest with them.
depression,fee2ipe,t3_eonbya,1579025047.0,I have a daughter I love more than anything else in this world. If she didn't come to me for help when she needed it I would be devastated. If you have a good relationship with them you owe it to them to come clean about how you're feeling. It's okay to ask for help. We all need it sometimes.
depression,fee26t1,t3_eonk8v,1579024851.0,Depression is sickness. You deserve the rest.
flightsim,fec1cy7,t1_fe43y5s,1578965217.0,My favorite plane. This thing is wicked.
flightsim,febzyw7,t3_eo635r,1578964758.0,"How about a good book to help him get started? May I suggest ""Rod Machados Private Pilot Handbook"" or ""From the ground up"". Not only would it quench his thirst when it comes to the theory and technical aspects of flying, but it will go a long way to when he eventually starts learning to fly when he's older. Now you could continue to use x-plane and maybe get him to try the ultralight that's included with the Sim. It's a much less complex machine that will let him practice takeoffs and landings at slower speeds. FSX is also a great idea that would allow him to turn off crash damage so he could get a better feel for things over time. Either way encourage him to make mistakes and learn from them. Eventually he'll get the hang of it."
CR10,fe7j7bq,t3_eo20lv,1578915294.0,If you're sure that nozzle is good you could check the feeder gear on the stepper motor. Sometimes they come loose or slide out of place a little.
happy,fdntlv3,t3_em36be,1578592577.0,I'm happy you're happy.
Xplane,fdf17do,t1_fdc9ne7,1578350994.0,You can also try using simbrief.com to build a flight plan and export it as an fms file. Then you can load that up in the g1000 and it will prefill all your waypoints.
Xplane,fdf0dzj,t1_fde3xtz,1578350479.0,Yup that would do it
Xplane,fde5dd1,t1_fde10s4,1578331541.0,"They're only for looks. I'm wondering if there is a pressurization failure in x-plane. Try loading the SF50 again, then clear all failures. Try flying up at a high altitude and see what happens."
Xplane,fde0pi3,t3_ekw8ip,1578328541.0,Not being funny... Was your door closed? Any aircraft failures that you could try and clear? I've been flying the DA62 which simulates hypoxia and it does this exact same thing if you forget to put on your mask about 12000ft
flightsim,fdb406r,t3_ekfw3i,1578253486.0,This is the way to fly. Explore every nook and cranny of an area to find those special spots that not many other people know about. I find it so much more satisfying than flying heavies from point A to B. Have fun out there.
Xplane,fd8v21c,t1_fd2yjay,1578223797.0,The ASK21 looks cool. Local to me is the CADET program where teenagers learn to fly gliders. They are old school Schweizer SGS 2-33. But it's free for the kids who go through the program. You must have so much fun in the summer.
flightsim,fd5wwau,t3_ejq2x4,1578182519.0,Drool. I love this plane.
flightsim,fd3zlk2,t3_ek0e17,1578162997.0,Made it to my first stop in Brazil today. Started in Trinidad this morning and made a stop in French Guiana at SOCA. Then a quick flight to SBOI. This airport is really cool. I filed VFR and had to change the plan en-route due to unfamiliarity. The vis was a little low and I'm glad I did an approach as there are 3 massive towers adjacent to the runway. If you're ever in the area you should check it out.
Xplane,fd2boa1,t1_fd23rig,1578144866.0,Well that is really cool. I've never flown gliders. Lots of friends who have. The best pilots I know all have glider experience. What type of glider have you flown?
Xplane,fczc8he,t1_fcr7uug,1578098005.0,I didn't know you flew gliders. That's awesome.
flightsim,fcyylv8,t3_ejkl5b,1578089959.0,All I need is a nice little ice strip and a 208.

flightsim,fcvv31e,t3_ej69rq,1578010768.0,"I was an airline pilot for just shy of 20 years until I got stuck with a bad medical condition. I used to use MS flight sim when in flight school to practice IFR approaches. I left the hobby once I started flying as my full time job. Too much of a good thing I guess. So now I can't fly and miss it more than I imagined I could. Recently got into x-plane to keep my knowledge as fresh as I can. 
So I would say many pilots avoid flight Sim as a hobby just because it becomes overwhelming between work and home life. But for someone like myself it's my new outlet to keep my dream alive in a sense."

flightsim,fcva58l,t3_ej3w01,1577997830.0,"Would you be against flying some general aviation planes to get your feet wet? You'd gain some valuable experience starting small. However if your heart is set on an airliner. Lots of people on here love the Zibomod 737 for xplane. And it's free. X-plane does have included aircraft that are more simplified versions of the real thing that might be good to get you started. There are also a bunch of YouTube videos in which pilots will go over all the intricate details of setup and operation. 

Personally I love the hands and feet flying of general aviation planes. There is a little learning curve, but it's so much fun to make milestones."
flightsim,fcv89tv,t1_fcv6l4z,1577996711.0,That sounds good. I've flown into KEWR a ton in the Q400 for reall. It's a super busy spot. I've often seen TEB from the air. That sounds like fun doing some hops...
flightsim,fcv2dfr,t3_eiznzf,1577993214.0,How did it go today? Send me your routing out of JFK when you have a second and I'll get myself set up.
VATSIM,fcuayrt,t1_fcu6pp4,1577976748.0,Agreed. It's the way the real world works.
