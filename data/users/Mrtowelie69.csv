Red emblems are the problem. But I do see what you mean, I do feel the lack of progress because I went the athalia route. But I wanted to build her and itll be a nice feeling when she's +30. I already had the other hero's except Fawkes at Ascended , he only needs two copies.

WTF,feqelh2,t1_fepi5pp,1579340937.0,"Scared? If I see shit like this, I don't get scared. I've been in situations no different then this. I saw a group of kids around 10 or so and they were killing ducks at the park. I was with my uncle and I don't stand for that kind of shit. I walked up to them and grabbed the kid who just snapped the ducks neck and threw him to the ground. His buddies didn't do shit. Want to know why? Because people are pussies. The people you need to be afraid of don't go tipping cars over. I don't know about you or anyone else, but I'm not scared to confront 5 people fucking up other peoples shit or attacking other people because I don't stand for shit like that. 


Now let's say this wasn't a car but a person and that person was your family member and somebody stood there filming your family member get their ass beat. Would you say i was dumb then? Or are you saying if you were there you would watch your family member get beat because you were scared and didn't want to be ""dumb"" in helping them. It doesn't matter IMO if its dumb or not, you see people in trouble, you fucking help them. Period.  Because at the end of the day it could be your property or your family being on the receiving end and you can call me dumb , that's fine by me. But the reason little shits like this do this , is because people are so fucking afraid of helping others even if it means putting themselves out there. 

But then again I know the kind of person I am and I don't worry about getting my ass kicked because when I see shit like this I just can't stand it.  And I would be scared of a 5-1 but i don't allow that fear to stop me from trying to help. Perhaps I'm wired differently from other people but I tend to care about everyone , even if I don't know them. Because I don't need to know someone to understand what they would feel/experience if this kind of shit happened to them , all I need to do is picture it happening to me and then I will know full well the emotions it would evoke."

I get that they technically commit suicide but they had no idea that would happen. So can it even be considered suicide? Didn't the holy guy murder them. He gave them a concoction that he created which is akin to poison then manipulated them into drinking it. So why were even the kids sent to hell?

It takes a lot of drops to lvl and the only way to obtain them is from elite/ascending. So if your f2p then its gonna take a while.....afka just becoming more and more p2w. Every new mechanic added only helps whales. But if you can get to high lvl and play for a few years , then maybe you can find use from this tree."

afkarena,fej80w4,t1_feixsxz,1579160826.0,Yeah she is fodder. I'm just waiting for more Rosa/Belinda copies and I'll use as fodder but the problem is I get ntn but fucking Raine's.....thus the 13E+ and the 1L+.....
afkarena,feiy20y,t1_fegjfhn,1579150405.0,I'm fucked for this one....shemira is literally my only DPS at lvl 270. I don't spend money anymore and haven't for many months. I spent when I started but now I'm strictly f2p so getting hero's that are DPS dealers has been tough.....hopefully my Brutus will suffice.
