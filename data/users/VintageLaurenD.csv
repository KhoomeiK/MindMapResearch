ADHD,ffsbpwv,t3_dof7h6,1580177916.0,"I knew right from the start my ex had ADHD. I didn't have high hopes, not because of him, but because if myself. I've spent my whole life dealing with manic depression. Shortly after my ex and I started dating, I had an emotional breakdown and had to be involuntarily taken to a psychiatric hospital. They agreed that I'm manic depressive but they also diagnosed me with ADHD, which was new to me. Never in my 30 years had I ever been diagnosed with that before, but after doing my mandatory counseling sessions, I realized that my life patterns are textbook ADHD. I found that my ex and I had probably one of the best relationships I've ever had with a partner. Even our breakup was easy/amicable. We both were just bored/tired and ready to move on. We're still friends and see each other every day. 

I think that if you guys talk through it, you can turn your relationship into one of friendship, possibly?

Hope that helps."
