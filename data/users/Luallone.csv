dogs,fgkhlbo,t3_ez0hf5,1580865745.0,"Oh, my dog loves to do this! She’s a lab mixed with...something. 

She also plays fetch with herself. She’ll rear her head back, release the ball forward, wait for it to bounce & roll away, then chase it down."
dogs,fgk0xi8,t3_eyvs31,1580855238.0,"I promised myself and my dog that I’d always love her as unconditionally as she loves me. Even if I get frustrated, as we all do with our dogs, it does not affect my love for her in any way. I also promised her that I’d never deny her care, and provide the best qualify of life possible. I will always advocate for her best interest, and be her voice, since she cannot speak for herself. And if I can no longer provide her with a good QOL, I will be unselfish and do what is best for her. Whether it be rehoming her because life with someone else would (hypothetically) be better than with me, or euthanizing her when she is terminally ill, even if it shatters my heart to do so, I’ll do it. I don’t like to think about her inevitable death, but I also have promised to be there with her if/when she is euthanized. 

I’ve put up with a lot from Delta, everything from jumping on people to reactivity. While she definitely was not the easiest first dog, we’ve worked on her baggage a lot, and she’s such a wonderful companion that they don’t negate just what an awesome dog she is. She’ll never be an obedience trial champion, but she’s the perfect dog for me. When I adopted her, I wanted a sweet, affectionate companion - and that’s what I got. 

Dealbreakers for me? Severe human aggression, towards me or anyone else. I don’t want a liability. While I’d prefer a dog that isn’t a biter, any dog willing to inflict a [Level 4](https://apdt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ian-dunbar-dog-bite-scale.pdf) bite or higher is a hard NO. Severe separation anxiety or coprophagia are also undesirable to me."
dogs,fghl05t,t3_eyjlmh,1580787205.0,"Ask your vet for a referral to a veterinary nutritionist. They are DVMs that have done an internship and three year residency in nutrition, and have the suffix DACVN (Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition). Many have advanced degrees in nutrition as well. They will help formulate a balanced diet to meet your dog’s dietary needs."
dogs,fggxz92,t3_eyfuag,1580772087.0,"Personally, 95% of the “wolf dogs” I’ve seen are just garden variety GSD/Husky or GSD/Malamute mixes. It’s very apparent that most of them have absolutely no wolf in them whatsoever, but most of their owners don’t want to hear that. 

Admittedly, I just skimmed the article, but I agree with you in that wolfdogs have no place in modern society. Dogs should be bred for a purpose - whether it be companionship, herding, sledding, or hunting. What purpose do wolf dogs fulfill that a regular dog can’t? 

From what I understand, legitimate wolf dogs (especially high content ones) don’t make particularly good pets, even for the small percentage of people capable of owning and caring for them. They exist only to elevate their owner’s social clout, which is a terrible reason to obtain an animal. That’s a very sad life for a creature to live IMO. 

I’m hoping that since the GOT and Twilight franchises are both over with that demand for them will decrease, but sadly, I have a feeling that won’t be the case."
dogs,fggw8vy,t3_eyfqvv,1580770959.0,"I’d suggest posting in a local subreddit as well - posting it in this sub might be a long shot. Crossposting in r/FortWorth or r/Dallas will reach more folks in the area. 

Perhaps also try reaching out to local shelters to see if anyone’s reported a lost dog. Social media might be a good bet too - check to see if the city has any Facebook groups for lost animals, or just for residents in general."
dogs,fggvlpl,t3_eyf18m,1580770552.0,"Definitely not a Weimaraner - Weims are fixed for isabella (dilute liver) on the [D locus](http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/dilutes.html) - dilution (d) is recessive, meaning that a dog needs two copies of the gene to express it (genotype dd). Purebred Weims can never be liver, because none of them have the dominant allele (D) in their genotype. The link above probably explained this much better than I did - sometimes I get a little carried away with the scientific jargon. 

Not to mention, long-haired Weims are quite rare, and your dog doesn’t resemble one much to me. Long hair in dogs is also recessive. I’d imagine that not too many Weims are carriers for long hair (meaning that they only have one recessive allele that they are able to pass on), so the odds of both the sire and dam having it & passing it along are pretty slim.  

I don’t think that she’s a liver FCR either. The coloring is correct, but she doesn’t look like one to me. FCRs have very distinctive wedge-shaped heads, and hers isn’t quite the right shape. Not to mention, they’re very hard to come by, at least in the US. If you’re outside of the States, I have no idea how popular they are elsewhere! 

Very cute pup though! My guess is that he’s a mix of multiple breeds, because nothing in particular really jumps out at me.

Edit: just realized that OP’s dog is male - changed “she’s” to “he’s”"
dogs,fggtlnq,t3_ey9urb,1580769268.0,"She wears her collar almost 24/7 - I only take it off while she’s being bathed, so it can be cleaned as well. I live rurally and if she escaped, who knows where she’d end up or who’d find her. She’s one of those dogs where if she ran away, she ain’t coming back on her own. It gives me peace of mind knowing that if someone finds her, the return process would be expedited. 

I am not concerned with her getting hurt by her collar. The benefits of this scenario FAR outweigh the the risks for me. I don’t crate her, she’s an only dog, and there’s nothing she could get caught on inside my home. I’d rather take a minuscule chance of a freak accident happening than the more realistic possibility of her getting lost and dying of exposure, wildlife, trigger-happy neighbors, livestock, or being hit by a car."
dogs,fgdlu0q,t1_fgd6o4l,1580683860.0,"A year or two back, there was a post here that was pretty much your nightmare scenario. OP was skateboarding with their off-leash toy breed when it approached a leashed Rottweiler. The Rottweiler attacked OP’s dog before its owner could do anything about it. OP’s dog didn’t survive, and they were seeking retribution on the Rottweiler’s owner. They absolutely refused to accept that they were at fault for having a dog at large. It was so maddening, and I can’t imagine how the poor Rottie’s owner felt."
dogs,fgc15ca,t1_fgbnwt9,1580668049.0,"Dogs shouldn’t be leashed inside of an off-leash dog park. Barrier aggression can occur when a leashed dog is approached by off-leash dogs, and they lash out as a result of their decreased mobility.  I have seen fights occur as a result of this, and they are not pretty. 

My local dog park requires leashes to be taken off in the airlock for this exact reason."
dogs,fgbzoue,t1_fgbqf30,1580667629.0,"The traffic light analogy is a very good one! Although, as the resident of a ~~city~~ state with notoriously horrendous drivers, I have seen people with that mentality IRL. I saw someone almost mow down a pedestrian & his dog the other day while making an illegal turn on red. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that far too many people think that the sun shines out of their ass, and therefore, they don’t have to follow rules in place for the greater good. It’s maddening."
dogs,fgbxsa4,t3_exrjyf,1580667133.0,"I wouldn’t unleash my dog in the first place - it’s a courtesy thing. Rules are rules, and there is no obligation whatsoever for anyone to like dogs. I think that there is a very pervasive sentiment in our society that dogs are pure creatures who can do no wrong, and that anyone who dislikes them has a chip on their shoulder. As a dog owner, I fully believe that my dog should never be an inconvenience to others. She is *my* animal, and it is therefore *my* responsibility to control her and enforce appropriate behavior. I always walk her on a leash, but if we encounter someone else on a trail, we always step off to the side and give them the right of way. I just think that it’s a polite thing to do?  I am not all that crazy about other people’s dogs myself, and certainly very much dislike being approached by them. 

I live in a small, very dog-friendly city with lots of parks and natural areas. The amount of entitled owners I encounter is astounding. There’s a very nice park downtown with miles of trails, and it’s just a wonderful place to spend an afternoon. Dogs must be leashed on all the trails and athletic fields. I have been bum rushed by off leash dogs no more than 100 yards from the fenced in, off leash dog park. People just assume that rules don’t apply to them, and that everyone will love their dog as much as they do. 

I am so sorry that you and your family had to experience this. You did not overreact at all - I have some choice words for those who allow their pets to disturb others. I was *terrified* of dogs as a child - especially large ones - so I completely empathize with you."

dogs,fgb7693,t3_exq8u4,1580659191.0,"I’d second donating them to the animal shelter. If they’re gently used, it wouldn’t be like “dumping trash” to them.

dogs,fg7nlib,t3_exbae8,1580596882.0,"In terms of appearance -she looks like some kind of freakish mashup between a whitetail deer and a dingo (I mean that in the kindest way). She, on the other hand, 100% believes that she is the size of a house cat.

In terms of personality - sometimes I literally have to remind myself that she isn’t a person. Owning her is like cohabiting with a human two year old that never grows up. She’s about as needy and helpless as a literal infant. Seriously, this dog couldn’t fight her way out of a wet paper bag. She’s lucky that she has a human that loves her as much as I do, because bless her heart, the poor thing wouldn’t stand a chance otherwise.

dogs,ffyozb5,t1_ffynl1p,1580351633.0,"Not trying to be inflammatory, but are you aware that Dog Food Advisor is run by a human dentist with no educational background in canine nutrition? Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine runs [Petfoodology](https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/petfoodology/), which is written by three veterinary nutritionists. It’s a much better source of information. 

Like I mentioned earlier, the brands I suggested all meet [WSAVA guidelines](https://www.wsava.org/WSAVA/media/Arpita-and-Emma-editorial/Selecting-the-Best-Food-for-your-Pet.pdf). One of these requirements is that the company must employ a full-time nutritionist (either a DVM + an internship, three-year residency, and board certification in clinical nutrition, or a PhD in animal nutrition - many have both). Personally, I’m more inclined to believe that those with relevant education in this field know what they’re talking about."
dogs,ffykj7t,t3_evwr1w,1580348618.0,"1) Some dogs are more sedentary than others, but keep in mind that all dogs need to go outside for exercise and to eliminate. I’d look into a senior dog or companion breeds.

2) Most shelters vaccinate their dogs before adoption, and you should be able to verify this. If you’re asking about the dog’s lifetime medical records, then probably no. If it was a stray, it obviously won’t have prior medical records, and I don’t believe that my owner-surrender came with any either. But we have very well-funded shelters and no overcrowding where I live, so YMMV.

3) It’s up to you. I always recommend crate training because you never know when you’ll need it (evacuation, utility workers coming over, dog on crate rest, etc). Some people crate at night, and some people don’t trust their dogs to have free run of the house when they’re gone for the day. 

4) Probably not necessary. I can’t imagine that a shelter would adopt a dog out with mites, but again, if it’s a true “pound” it may not operate the same way at shelters around here do, so YMMV. If it is necessary, you should be notified of it.

5) Most people bathe as needed - i.e. when they’re truly dirty or especially stinky. 

6) You can choose between traditional nail clippers or a nail grinder. Nail clippers come in two styles: [guillotine](https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/PETCO/2369451-center-2) and [scissors-style](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/1dfa65cd-7212-4b41-b76c-4651310ba347_1.8943b7a92404ca9c2768a130238a91ca.jpeg?odnWidth=450&odnHeight=450&odnBg=ffffff). A lot of people find guillotine-style clippers to be easier to use. Some people prefer [Dremel nail grinders](https://www.amazon.com/Dremel-7300-PT-4-8V-Nail-Grooming/dp/B003TU0XG4?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&psc=1) over traditional nail clippers, but keep in. But keep in mind that some dogs really dislike the noise they make. [Here’s](https://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/outreach/Pet-Health-Topics/categories/procedures/dogs/clipping-your-dog's-claws) a great how-to on nail maintenance and anatomy. 

7) As someone else said, you should feed what she’s currently eating, and slowly wean her off of it and onto a new food. You should choose a food that meets guidelines set forth by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association: the only five brands to do so are Purina, Royal Canin, Iams, Hills, and Eukanuba.

I’m not going to freeze my ass off because she wants to sniff where she pissed yesterday for 15 minutes, but I do try to let her take in her surroundings. 

I find that mental stimulation in general is a neglected aspect of dog ownership. It’s quite sad really.
