Also: Life goes on. I don't know if you have ever had something traumatic happen, but you need to keep eating, keep breathing and keep doing what you did before. Only now traumatised (or not depends on the person or situation.

My point is: Looking into someones post history to see if someone really experienced someone is probably not going to tell you much about if it really happend or not."
Meditation,fe78qox,t1_fe0n33n,1578911534.0,"I have been meditating for 2.5 months now.
After the first 2 weeks I started enjoying it more and it became easier to sit still longer. Yesterday I meditated for an hour straight, just because it felt good.

If I were you I would just sit for how long you like instead of having a strict schedule."
AskReddit,fe2khsk,t1_fdyoue2,1578839511.0,"I have that. But not because getting lost in the woods.

Also only drink water from a stream, never from a pool. If the water stands still, don't drink it!

HongKong,fe16mmo,t1_fdzvdsz,1578823075.0,"Tbh I dont think it is a concern.
The media in other countries (including my own, shame on us the Netherlands) were mostly in favor of China. If it was reported at all.

I have only seen news from when PolyU was under attack in my country and the only thing jt said was: Poor police guy got shot in the leg with an arrow by protesters. The protesters are throwing thing at the police and so the police resulted to violence. Things like that.

They made it seem like the police were the victims. They also didn't say anything about the students being students. They just called them protesters and didnt even show that they were students."
todayilearned,fdurdrq,t1_fdrnic6,1578737783.0,"She didnt know that she would get a heart attack mid flight. 
She probably thought that her injuries weren't that bad.
I mean, there are faster and more effective ways to commit suicide.

Also: Incoveniencing people by getting a heart attack? If I were on that flight I would just be glad that she survived. I think that it is kind of weird to think that someone almost dying is nothing more then an incovenience."
2meirl4meirl,fdsatf6,t1_fdrnmiv,1578698335.0,"Depends. If they are traumatic memories and the brain pushed them away because you cant handle dealing with them now you might get some back or parts of them. But that really depends from person to person (repressed/supressed memories is what I was trying to describe).

If they are ""unimportant"" memories (think about day to day life) and you were extremely stressed, probably not.

I personally wouldn't worry about it. You are not what happend in the past and you are not your memories. It is important to focus on who you want and are going to be in the future."
coolguides,fds6ipv,t1_fds57zy,1578695465.0,"I heard someone mentioning other countries getting payed to keep immigrants in.
That could very well also be the case for a lot of North-African countries (like Morroco) since they are close to Europe.

There are also a lot of people that travel from other african countries to North-Africa and then try to get to Europe.
Which is very sad, because more often then not they get stuck in North-Africa and North-Africans don't really except them in their country. It is truly very sad to see."

AskReddit,fdmvpns,t1_fdm4gut,1578568025.0,"I wasn't allowed to close my bedroom door ever.

Also not allowed to lock the toilet and bathroom door, which I did anyway. We did have some fights over it though.

Also I wasn't allowed to be in my bedroom until I was 15 (except from sleeping). I always had to be in sight."
AskReddit,fdmuzmz,t1_fdmm0tp,1578567064.0,"I had the: we don't date, we get married rule.

I don't even know how I was suposed to do that without being in an arranged marriage?

My mom also had her own list of what my future husband should look and how he should be like.

By the time I was 17 she started talking about ""the perfect son in law."""
lawofattraction,fdl708k,t1_fdkx423,1578518115.0,"Interesting. Does it work well for you?

People actually say that saying ""no"" to something is saying ""yes"", because your attention still flows to the thing you dont want and thus creates it.

Or do you feel at peace when you think of not wanting someone?"

AmItheAsshole,fdgi26s,t1_fdfmzf7,1578397698.0,"Are you sure he was Dutch?
I am Dutch and no one here is named Hanzel. I think it is German: like Hanzel und Gretel. In Dutch they are named Hans en Grietje. 

Not trying to destroy the mood: I've just never heard of someone named Hanzel here."
AmItheAsshole,fddyaab,t1_fddxxnl,1578326910.0,"Yeah, I like telling the story because it shows how there is still hope. My father is arabic so it is very rare for someone like him to do chores.
But there are people who are like that out there, you just need to find the right one and you need to find someone who really cares about your wants and needs and is willing to change and meet you in the middle.
Sorry, there were so many and's in there."

I love dyeing hair so I am ready to dye anyones hair as long as they pay for the products themselves (I don't have any experience though. Only experience I have is having dyed my own mothers and my own hair a million times)."
AmItheAsshole,fddnwcb,t1_fddf67z,1578319057.0,"My parents are both from a culture where the wife does take care of the children and does everything, but suprisingly my dad always helped (even though my mom is a stay at home mom).
He always helped us shower and dress us. The only thing he refuses to do is cooking. But other chores like laundry and vacuming he has always done.

It suprised me so much when a friend of mine (who is white/european) said that her father expected her mother to do all the house hold chores even if she was sick!"

When you worry you manifest more insecurety and more worry, when you focuss on being with them you experience more being with them.
You need to watch your focus."
NevilleGoddard,fd8bv38,t1_fd8b9rb,1578216541.0,"I never said it wasn't.
It is just that your effort won't be very much appreciated, because you give them information that they will not be able to understand yet.

It is like trying to teach a toddle advanced math. It is the truth, but he will not be able to understand it. A good teacher teaches him what he is ready to hear until he feel ready for the next and the next until he feels ready to learn advanced math."
NevilleGoddard,fd8b26a,t1_fd87zwz,1578216169.0,"You are giving them advice that a lot of people who progressed further understand. Not beginners.

You don't need to know the rules, you need to feel it. And at the moment they don't feel it yet and that is okay.

EDIT: A good example would be: Telling a very depressed person that the world can be very beautiful.
It is the truth, but not a message that can reach them yet. They first have some work to do before they can really feel them.

A good teacher would help them see what work they have to do so that they can really feel tthe message."

lawofattraction,fd62fux,t3_ek2533,1578184625.0,"Ask and it is given!

I personally didn't like the style the secret is written in. I also feel like the secret treats the LOA more like a magic trick (but that is just me so make sure to read a few pages of the book you want to buy first so that you can see what style you like).

I really like the style Abraham Hicks writes ands speaks in. I also found that ask and it is given gets a bit deeper then the secret and explains the logic behind it more. And it has more pages! 

What I do really like about the secret is that they have their own site with lots of succes stories. I also liked the documentary (the first half is a bit though to get through, but I really liked the second part)."

If there is one thing I learned from them it is: You can't force anyone to get help and don't spend yourself being stuck in a situation you don't want to be in.

Our time on this plannet is very limmited, so spend it the best you can. If that means giving your wife an ultimatum then so be it, but I would change the ultinate from not drinking at all to looking for counseling.
