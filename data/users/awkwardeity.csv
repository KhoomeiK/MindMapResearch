How do I add a flair to a comment? ðŸ¥º"
NetflixSexEducation,ffehve3,t3_et5j4o,1579848634.0,"I think the show has a retro aesthetic? ðŸ¤” 


Also, to put it out there
The actors are in their very early 20s except Ncuti who plays Eric. Heâ€™s 27.
The show obviously handles very adult themes, to put minors in such roles is unethical and uncomfortable."
NoStupidQuestions,ffbywkq,t3_ess2j9,1579787133.0,"In addition to the great advice in other comments (avoiding caffeine, your phone etc) the trick is to _put both your mind and body at ease._ Meditation helps (there are many apps with bedtime meditation, such as Headspace) 
It also helps to get comfortable, Make sure you have clean sheets and a well made bed. Put on some comfy jammies. All that. 
A nighttime ritual has also helped me! It could include things like brushing your teeth, skin care or even just a warm glass of milk. Itâ€™s a way of winding down and telling your body itâ€™s bed time.
Rest well!"

I donâ€™t even ship Maeve and Otis that much but the weak attempts by the writerâ€™s to â€˜not give people what they want *just yet*â€™ is what irks me.
More than them not getting together, itâ€™s the convulated dragged out course of their relationship which frustrates me. AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

NetflixSexEducation,ff8umzg,t1_ff8qak2,1579696662.0,I wish the show did a better job of pointing out they werenâ€™t good for each other. Instead they just made them disagree on one thing and say â€˜I love youâ€™ immediately after.
