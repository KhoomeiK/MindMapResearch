worldbuilding,ffe1fwb,t1_ffdmyrx,1579834220.0,"It's similar in Shattered Skies. If a ship is any bigger than an airplane, they don't bother with in atmo flight and use auxiliary craft. But fighters, recreational ships, shuttles and some versions of interstellar transports (basically space busses). Ships that are more akin to small buildings can theoretically fly in atmo, but tend to be extremely ungainly and difficult to control, requiring a veteran pilot to do so. Mostly due to lack of atmosphere specific propulsion. Ionic engines only work so well in atmo."
