AskScienceDiscussion,fdfs6ud,t3_ekwqkl,1578368890.0,The original question has two flaws in it. The first is that we have a complete understanding. This is not actually true. Gravity has not been accounted for and other things have gotten in the way of the standard model (black energy and black matter). This means that there must be something missing. QM my be good at predicting certain thing it is not good at other and there fore is an incomplete representation of the universe.

sex,fc4lcsb,t3_efxmel,1577420071.0,My personal opinion is that sex is the ultimate statement of an intamate friendship. You are not doing an act that can easily replicate with some one else's.
