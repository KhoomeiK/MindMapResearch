news,ffb3puk,t3_esfi6e,1579751000.0,I'm skeptical of this. That's 10lbs less than my medium sized dog and about 6 or 7 lbs more than my 15 month old niece. Either this kid is very short or the report is incorrect. 25-26 lbs for a 16yo boy doesn't sound possible.

I was running in the house, even though my mama told me not too, and I hit my pinky toe on a doorway.  My toe stayed and the rest of my foot kept going ripping the skin.  It sucked."
allenedmonds,ff4bpy2,t3_erivmt,1579559875.0,Very cool.  Those are beautiful!

AskReddit,fdgmo1t,t1_fdfzanp,1578402435.0,I assumed so but maybe not. At least not yet. I'd be fine with this being a one-off too though.
Watches,fdfr5qp,t3_eksp45,1578368200.0,"I bought this same watch as an impulse buy from Drop (Massdrop) not long ago for under $200. I immediately had buyer's remorse until I finally received it and now, it's easily one of my faves. Excellent watch for the money. Congrats!"

frugalmalefashion,fco6vuy,t1_fcnqiit,1577825218.0,The comment about buying a ton was a joke. There are just a few certain things I've been keeping an eye on (e.g.: camel topcoat and certain chino colors). I buy things I need or really want; I don't buy them just because they're cheap.
frugalmalefashion,fcnoj0t,t1_fcn55xn,1577815418.0,"No, of course not. Just hoping for another killer sale."

frugalmalefashion,fcmz35y,t3_ehyape,1577798295.0,"> they didnt overbuy this year 

Oh, is that what happened?  Damn... I thought it was going to be an annual thing.  I also need 14 boxes of shit.  Keeping my fingers crossed for a cheap topcoat.  But they went back to the old fit so they're probably not losing their asses on them like they did last year."
allenedmonds,fcmyfla,t3_ehw655,1577797605.0,Sounds like you got a well-fitting pair of shoes.  The heel slip is probably from the shoes being new and stiff.  That'll get better as the shoes break in.
frugalmalefashion,fcmybg1,t3_ehy2z5,1577797484.0,Why would you pay even $150?  This thing shouldn't be more than like 40 bucks full price.
