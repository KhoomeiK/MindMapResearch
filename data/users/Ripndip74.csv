todayilearned,ffhpttz,t3_etim6j,1579947482.0,this reminds me of a story my dad told me about his coworker who was cuban. He said when he was about 3-4 years old his dad brought him on a boat and they fled cuba. They were caught and lined up by the cuban army or whoever it was. They started with the first guy and told him to shoot the man behind him or he'd be killed. He refused so they killed him. This continued on for about 4 more people. They got to my dads coworkers father and said kill the guy behind you or we shoot your son. He ended up shooting 2 people behind him before they got back. He eventually was able to make it to the US a few years later and ended up committing suicide about 5 years after that.

todayilearned,ffhelhe,t3_etlyys,1579932047.0,Man I found out about this maybe 10 years ago and I check it every few years and always have money owed to me. I tell everyone I know about this. Super easy. Claim it. Fill out the info and they’ll send you a check for that amount. The first time I checked I had $300+ owed to me
streetwearstartup,ffgbnzz,t1_ffg95py,1579902686.0,"Same. Felt like that’s what this sub was supposed to be. A way for people to share their work and help others out. If it’s just a sub for people to post pictures and you either up vote or down vote and that’s it, is lame af"

FL_Studio,ffeh57v,t1_ffegqrt,1579847809.0,I want to say there was a fl 11 beta for Mac so they may have updated it to be more stable or he’s running it in a virtual window (in my experience is not doable) those are the only things I can think of. The beta version might be what they’re using
