flightsim,ffbiyjb,t1_ffadl0q,1579767483.0,It's actually a minute long and this is demonstrating the fps on the ground at busy airports.
arma,ff8kivt,t1_ff7o7wj,1579682865.0,"On something this small? Nothing will really be kicked up.  
On a bigger bird? It'll generate some spray that will get sucked back into the rotors, but that'll all occur near the tips, not central, and definitely not enough quantity to clog the filters.  
If filters were that sensitive to a little bit of water, they'd never fly in the rain."
nfl,femmn2y,t1_fem4pel,1579262771.0,Does BB accept cash though? I think he does the whole devil thing where it is simply something of great personal value. For Kraft it was non-discount working girls.
technology,femgym7,t1_femc3dd,1579254994.0,"There's a good chance a lot of bots will remain at the basic level since some sites won't bother banning them. When one key metric for how valuable your site is, is user base and user interaction, not a whole lot of incentive to go removing the ones that aren't just obvious spam bots."
todayilearned,fej8zx3,t1_feio7nm,1579162105.0,"I'm curious how that was an issue in the first place, or how this solves it.  
The people who won, could look up the numbers themselves to see if they won.   
If the clerk was scanning the ticket and lying to the customer and saying ""Nope sorry not a winner"" how would publishing the clerks name solve anything?  
If the clerk says ""Yes you won"" well you should have read right on the ticket where it states that winnings over $500 must be taken to state lottery office. If he takes the ticket, once again how is the fact that his name will be published going to prevent him from cashing the ticket himself?"

worldnews,feg7sjf,t1_feftz04,1579081091.0,"MCAS was designed with two AoA sensors in mind. Whoever at Boeing made the decision to sell the second sensor as an optional extra, and whoever at the FAA allowed the second sensor to be optional, are the ones most at fault here.  

Secondary would be the designers. They should have expected that even a dual AoA sensor failure could happen and not given it so much authority (How much it's allowed to move the controls) or priority (How much it's allowed to contradict pilot input)."
worldnews,feg7sd3,t1_feg0ins,1579081083.0,"The problem MCAS was to correct was the aerodynamic lift produced by the engine nacelles in high AoA turns, not really CoG. Basically due to their position and size, in a high AoA turn it could cause the plane to pitch up and stall."
AskReddit,fed5tj7,t1_fecukg9,1579000320.0,"Condoms in the US definitely are a big problem too. FDA doesn't allow them above a certain nominal width due to integrity issues. So if you're more than 1/2"" or so above average girth, you get stuck with a tourniquet or having to get some custom sized expensive ones that really aren't the best feel."

worldnews,fdjjnsg,t1_fdj9s85,1578473938.0,"Also if it didn't ""point"" either physically or electronically, it wouldn't be able to determine direction. That's pretty much how radar azimuth spoofing works. Mimic a strong signal at a side or rear lobe and the radar will naturally assume the signal is coming from where it's pointed."

todayilearned,fdjgkrk,t1_fdj1nq5,1578469879.0,"Old case from around here a husband suspected his wife was trying to hire somebody to kill him so he went to police. They had a cop go undercover and get her to offer a nominal ""deposit"" which apparently was enough they could prosecute. The cop literally went undercover as a cop and the woman still tried to hire him."
arma,fdgjitl,t1_fdg9gzb,1578399344.0,I'd recommend it even if you want to disable all the realism stuff. Ace arsenal is damn near worth it by itself.
CombatFootage,fdgb4wc,t1_fddpnd0,1578388103.0,"Ignoring the explosive component of some shells, no. Most of the danger would come from shrapnel or spalling. You'd definitely notice one fly by, but it wouldn't hurt you. The only place you could really get messed up by a concussive blast (that isn't from an explosive warhead) is in the immediate area in front of tank when it fires it's main cannon. The gasses leaving the barrel of a tank create a large area of over-pressure."
CombatFootage,fddp419,t1_fddowrk,1578320118.0,Round is probably not hitting directly but just in vicinity causing shake or debris.
IsItBullshit,fddoz0r,t3_eki46x,1578319997.0,"Terminology is different in US. Paid holiday only refers to days on what you'd call bank holidays. Companies may offer Sick, Personal, and Vacation time in addition to those days. Federal employees with 0-3 years of tenure will receive 13 sick days, 13 vacation days, and 10 paid holidays. For other jobs there is no requirement. In most decent full-time jobs you'll usually at least see is 10 holidays, 10 days vacation, 5 days sick leave."
CombatFootage,fdcyj9e,t1_fdccc3s,1578288129.0,Also you'd never really see a sabot flying through the air all the way to the target. The sabot is simply the material around the sub-caliber munition that lets it travel down the larger caliber barrel nicely.
CombatFootage,fdcyab5,t1_fdbczx0,1578287908.0,"Anything on a tripod really. Recoil-less rifles are often mounted on a high or low tripod, or sometimes just shouldered. These present a serious risk to tanks and they often don't think twice about engaging anything that might be AT weaponry. You'd have better chance of survival running around with an AK."
todayilearned,fd8h538,t1_fd7w4i2,1578218332.0,"Brand changes people's opinions a lot. I worked at a local family owned restaurant that people raved as having the best fried chicken. I've also worked at KFC which people would joke and complain about as being an abomination.   
Literally the only thing different was the brand on the bag of seasoning. Everything down to the oil was identical. Prepped the same way, cooked the exact same way, and even had the same hold/discard tag system."
politics,fd8fdbj,t1_fd7351u,1578217734.0,"Eh most likely you'd just get bad/misleading intel (before or after the fact) that says ""Hey look at all these military forces using this cultural site to try and shield from attack."" at which point it'd technically be a war crime on Iran and US would be justified in attacking it."
politics,fd8em5q,t1_fd6yxh7,1578217568.0,"Yeah, as long is there is no clear indication that they are being used for military purposes (this exemption is intentionally added so that military actors do not use cultural or predominantly civilian sites as defense) it's definitely bad guy move that serves no purpose besides try and scare Iran."
nfl,fd79zp3,t1_fd76y5t,1578201384.0,I'd be more upset if the team looked like a playoff caliber team and got snubbed or something. But they didn't. They just weren't a good team and early season wins let them at least make it to the play-offs where they promptly got beat by a team that played better.
nfl,fd77sg5,t1_fd7240y,1578200548.0,Fortunately worked out in their case. Had the Patriots actually had an offense it would have severely backfired.
nfl,fd779wz,t1_fd71rsz,1578200354.0,I mean realistically I can say the same too. I can actually watch the conference championship and Superbowl and not have to listen to any B/S about my team.

nfl,fd6vky5,t1_fd5nze5,1578196277.0,Well not to mention a returner specifically has to take a knee or lay down.
nfl,fd69ip3,t1_fd60l2s,1578187586.0,"Spot of foul or 10 yards from LoS. In this case where he was more than 10 yards from LoS it's pretty much just treated as a sack. If this had occured 3 yards from LoS, he would have saved 7 yards by taking the sack."

AskReddit,fcwus7f,t1_fcvsnko,1578038481.0,"You'd be pretty much guaranteed to get sucked in. A black hole the diameter of our sun with a mere 10 mile high event horizon would be 470,895 times heavier than our sun currently. The minimum speed Earth would need to orbit would be slightly over 20,000 km/s. Earth is currently orbiting at about 30."

todayilearned,fcsvz0d,t1_fcsukbf,1577926504.0,"The concept? It's the Judgement of Solomon. Two mothers, one legitimate and one (knowingly) illegitimate feuded for custody of a child. Solomon suggested the baby be cut in half and evenly distributed. One mother essentially said ""So be it"" and the other resigned her claim and begged for the other mother to simply be awarded custody. Solomon concluded that the true mother would never agree to having the child be killed out of spite and thus awarded custody to woman who begged for the life of the child."

todayilearned,fc0pkn1,t1_fc0jr6k,1577296598.0,The reason being is that a trial should be 12 jurors each forming their own opinion. If one juror has substantial knowledge in a subject they're likely to influence other jurors or have jurors go to them when they have a question instead of the judge.
