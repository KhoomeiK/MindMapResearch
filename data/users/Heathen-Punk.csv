MilitaryStories,few54ud,t3_eqqttu,1579405530.0,Fuck yeah man. Beautiful. :)
ChoosingBeggars,feof6ck,t3_eq32w3,1579299293.0,"Ok, for real, this person has some legitimate mental health issues. At first it was kinda funny, then reading it further, this person needs help. Not a laptop, maybe 600c of thorazine and a nice soft straitjacket and a padded cell...,"

The world needs more nurses! You can do it!"

Once you deviate from the norm, people's tribalism suddenly raises its head. There is a cognitive dissonance that occurs with people: ""wow how cool that person is following their own path, why are they doing that way, it's wrong!""  Just ignore it."
offmychest,fdj80n0,t3_eljpa4,1578461069.0,"Man, keep rocking that shit. Well done and keep kicking ass! :)"
offmychest,fdaja3f,t3_eke6wg,1578246681.0,Hey OP I think this is a classic case of projecting. The issue isn't with you: it's your mom. She doesn't feel healthy and takes it out on you. Keep doing what you are doing for you. Never mind her.
offmychest,fc3opuy,t3_eg04gh,1577394822.0,"Sounds like you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Just take a couple of deep breaths and remember:

2. Use protection! Protect yourself always

And try to relax and have fun :)"
