bipolar,ff0c6ay,t3_er1j2y,1579467529.0,"I understand smoking is nice and relaxing, but it’s a very short term helper. It’s medically known that BP shouldn’t smoke (or at least rarely) because it worsens BPs symptoms in long term. I highly recommend trying to stop. Btw, it takes 6 weeks to be completely out of your system."
bipolar,feolfwu,t3_eq3lgv,1579301822.0,"Some psychiatrists allow relatives/friends to join the sessions. Mine asked me if I wanted to invite someone and that it was totally fine. Maybe using the “I’d like to understand better about it” excuse could help. If you join a few times you can also bond with the therapist / psychiatrist to alert for red flags. 

I tried to invite someone to mine but unfortunately it was too messed up (yay bipolar) and it was a no. 

I’d love for my friends/relatives to know more and understand what I go through so they also don’t get as affected by it, but not everyone thinks this way... especially not when you are in hypomania/manic where there’s no such a thing as us being bipolar... we are just awesome and had a rough time lol (that’s what my brain tells me)"

Reading this also makes me wonder we suffer a lot, but we also appreciate our little victories much more xx"
bipolar,fekj5a4,t1_fek1v37,1579201133.0,He probably thought it was a joke and it was funny... but you also didn’t lie! Haha
bipolar,fehl37x,t1_fef4o6m,1579118731.0,Meh I guess if you have enough liquids should be fine. Juice isn’t ideal I’d say cause of sugar ...

bipolar,fe4ynoo,t1_fe4atp9,1578864052.0,"I kinda agree with you... it’s hard to know what to say when you are the other person. He/she really kept it very light, which is nice. 

Much better than “no you are not bipolar, that is not true... you don’t seem crazy”"
bipolar,fe4x2se,t3_ensjbd,1578863594.0,"Easier said than done, I know - but go see a doctor asap. If you have a psychiatrist even better. 

Take meds, cut alcohol, weed, set early alarms and force yourself out. Even if a 10 min walk at the park. If you can’t do it one day, try again the next, and the next, and the next... start your day by going out. And if you can’t dress, go in pijamas .. who cares!!! Best of luck, been there 💕"
BipolarSOs,fdb4wkg,t1_fday6g3,1578253870.0,That’s your argument? You went low. You take care of yourself :-). Can understand why your Ex couldn’t stand you anymore.
BipolarSOs,fdawe6k,t1_fdavyxb,1578251127.0,"I’ve never talked in his particular case, but in general. Weed IS nice and DOES help... but if you have BP with anxiety. It helps I. The short term to calm down, but does affect the brain. And in ways that most people don’t know how. 

So good his doctors that he doesn’t even go to therapy or a psychologist... by the way! Good luck with your narrow view..."
BipolarSOs,fdatw76,t1_fdatm9v,1578250094.0,Didn’t need much to drive you crazy. Well clearly your BF or Ex BFs plan is working ;-)
BipolarSOs,fdabwld,t1_fdablmt,1578244320.0,Meant in general “you”. If you don’t use YouTube with videos from the BEST global doctors on BP then buy books!
BipolarSOs,fdaae1l,t1_fda9008,1578243650.0,"Questions for you is - did you study medicine? Are you surrounded and grew up around doctors? Have you read on the topic from books and not internet posts? I believe weed can create feelings of relaxation... but doesn’t make better the disease. Just go to YouTube and search videos (even from Miklowitz) and you’ll see. There are many others. 

I’ll leave with this since seems that this SO page isn’t much for discussion, understanding, debate (friendly), but complaining about BP, that you should never date one and tapping on each other backs. Seems you were really great partners. Hope you’ll find some one like you."
BipolarSOs,fda8x74,t1_fda7zdt,1578243161.0,"I understand it can be difficult. The question is is this a constant or ups and downs over the period of mania / depression? Because if that isn’t the case then yes. BP people have different stages, believes and thoughts and actions according to those"
BipolarSOs,fda1mxb,t1_fd9vcjl,1578240688.0,"That’s not what I’m saying. I said that sometimes people are not meant to be together. But from the OP messages seems like her perspective on BP is distorted. Also didn’t seem that understanding or supportive by smoking weed together, him being manic / hypomanic and reinforcing the medicine seems to be working or that nothing else can be done. 

Like I didn’t come here to tap on her back (while I do understand it’s hard and never said otherwise), the OP should also not tap on the back and always take as a “normal” person the others best interests at heart, especially when one cannot make clear/wise decisions."
BipolarSOs,fd9rr8h,t1_fd8w84o,1578237166.0,"I’m not deciding, I’m telling a fact. I’m surrounded by excellent doctors, go to a psychiatrist and psychologist every 2 weeks, have read tons (medical books, not reddit) and tested it myself. Weed is for sure nice (don’t take me wrong) and I also felt great when doing it. But it was a short term solution, and we should be looking for feasible long term solutions."
BipolarSOs,fd9r3oa,t1_fd93593,1578236992.0,Medical weed as been legalized but not for bipolar lol okay so other medications are legal does this mean you should use them to treat any disease?
BipolarSOs,fd8vus5,t1_fd8vjn5,1578224169.0,People with bipolar tend to be addicted to alcohol and drugs as ways of auto medication. The fact he needs weed to be better means he needs a medicine that works.
BipolarSOs,fd8vo8s,t1_fd8vbqy,1578224081.0,"First, you don’t have to be rude by saying “deal with more bipolar”. What you are looking is for a tap on the back. 

I think as girlfriend if you are committed to someone you also have the duty to help. Otherwise seems we probably might have different opinions on “couple’s definition”"
BipolarSOs,fd8uph1,t1_fd8rgzr,1578223634.0,"Just to add, if he’s manic or hypomanic a lot then he should be in therapy and considering new medications on top of quitting smoking. That is the whole point of medication."
BipolarSOs,fd8ug3c,t1_fd8rgzr,1578223515.0,"It’s okay if you don’t hear opinions... you can hear a facts though. I did smoke weed regularly and once I realized maybe I should try to stop it if I really wanted to make an effort and be all in in getting better I had to try stopping. I did and few much better. It probably won’t affect you but will affect him.

It’s clear that you probably are still very far from understanding BP, must people don’t understand it. Must BP people don’t understand the full extent of it either. 

Of course, even “normal” couples break up because they aren’t simply a match. That could be the case too!"
BipolarSOs,fd8o8uk,t3_ekak1e,1578220824.0,"Couple of things as the one with BP2:
- remember the good times;
- is he trying to make improvements to his health I.e. therapy, medicine, routines, no alcohol, drugs... working on himself? 
- is he like this all the time or just during mania/hypomanic?

This can be very hard for the SO, but what it seems is that everyone advises just to walk away from us. We didn’t choose to have BP, we can’t even control it to a very huge extent and we hate it as much or more than others (my view). I am lucky to have my ex still in my life supporting me a lot, but if we don’t ever recover from the damage my disease created I’ll be destroyed for the rest of my life. 

Also trying is really important. I noticed that stopping drugs and alcohol (even if a glass) and having a sleep-wake up routine (weekends too, this for me was a big issue but I’m there now) immediately makes me feel better (and medicine). 

If you want there’s a book from Miklowitz on “the bipolar disorder survival guide” which is easy read and recommended to everyone."
bipolar,fd2lblx,t1_fd2gzyk,1578148845.0,I’m BP2... I hope that was the question
bipolar,fd1youl,t3_ejpwxu,1578138889.0,"I kick-ass at work. I overachieve my targets and I’m super friendly and outgoing (I’m already outgoing, but hypomanic - people sometimes without knowing I am - comment I’m super happy and it’s nice to be around my positive vibe). I’ve even earned 3rd best place in my org globally and a price for quarter achievements while hypomanic ... I guess it will help pay transportation to therapy for a few good months 😂 the not so great is that I’m overconfident and tend to sometimes call people off - the ones I shouldn’t."
Life,fcpjhn5,t1_fcpj4rw,1577865752.0,"Maybe... ;-). Btw was awesome NYE! No hangover, watched movies and slept enough 😁"
Life,fcon7a4,t1_fcolt0q,1577836451.0,Yes :-)
Amsterdam,ewmggvf,t3_cowch1,1565551071.0,What’s the idea behind this?
