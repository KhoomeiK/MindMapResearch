gamedev,fcj1xj4,t3_ehg570,1577675243.0,"Game title: Enframe

The video is showing the new Dark Mode feature I have developed for my game that was requested by a fellow Reddit user. This will hopefully make easier on the eye when playing at night.

How I made this:

This is my first game and I made it using GameMaker Studio in my free time over the course of a year (in between a full time job and family). The dark mode was mainly implemented using shaders. I had a few different scripts used to apply different effects. One for example just made all colours 30% darker, another script inversed the colours. Some sprites were more of a challenge so I just created a separate version for greater control of individual pixels. It was my first time playing with shaders and can highly recommend trying something like this to learn about them as they are relatively straight forward to do as compared to the typically stuff shaders are capable of. 

If you are keen to try out Enframe, you can download here:
