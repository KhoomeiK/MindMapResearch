Stassi - admits to hitting Jax and makes a joke about it in Season 1 - nothing happens

Katie - calls everyone every name under the sun in an agressive way - nothing happens

James - after being mocked for his shorts he calls Katie fat - gets fired

Max & Brett - makes racists tweets; in a public way includes violence - nothing happens

vanderpumprules,ffbk9lh,t3_eslmiv,1579769318.0,"I know what you mean. 

As a manager (who organises shifts) if someone asked my boss if my team could stay late one night, then literally on the day (or less than 24 hours before) I found out, I'd be pissed off. Or if I was told a few days before then everyone called in sick less than 24 hours before I'd be stressing!

I think that was Tom's point, Swarzt doesn't do the rota, so he wouldn't have thought of that. And what Tom said about 12 hour shifts is right.

So I think he was right about that part, but just no need to rage text Stassi, he should have said to Swartz 'well whose gonna cover the bar, we need X amount and it can't be anyone whose working the night shift' and let him figure it out!"
vanderpumprules,ffbk4oe,t3_esn2bh,1579769124.0,"Yeah.

I can sort of get the bra thing (although I'd never go out without one) but no knickers, especially considering the length of the skirt/dresses they were.

Random question; I suffer from anxiety (always been very nervous) and I swear my Moxley has got it from me; sometimes he's really brave but occasionally I think 'oh no my nerves have made him nervous', do you get anything similar?"

Over Xmas I had three cocktails (in a can- from the supermarket) over about a 7 hour period; later that night I felt just wrong. Not drunk but my tummy hurt and my head hurt...

Maybe I developed an allergy to it? Or maybe it was the food + drink combo?

recruitinghell,ff2ih70,t3_er52iy,1579507590.0,"Haha, so true. At our place their 'weather policy' states 'if there are adverse weather try your best to travel to the nearest office, if you deem it safe to do so'

Last year we had pretty deep snow and I manage to drive into work for 7am, it was still snowing heavily. By 10am they decided to close the office, but the snow was so heavy gritting didn't work so we then had over an hour of people attempting to drive up a hill of snow. And five people full on crashed. I managed to get out with a bit of slip sliding; was home by 11am and just thought 'why did I do that to myself!'"

recruitinghell,femyp5s,t1_femxeru,1579273000.0,"I find this really condescending, *just being honest.*

If you had an employee who was always going on doctors appointments (along with other things, see my post below) and could never provide the reason for going on to appointments (either to yourself or HR/occ health) and then you had other suspicions (example; person leave an hour early on a Friday for an appointment; you then find out they went to a gig that night 3 hours drive away and they started posting drinking photo's on Facebook 3 hours after they left - so suspect)

I did also manage someone who had severe depression and ended up in a secure care location; but she was honest about what she was going through (without giving details) worked with Occupational Health; got doctors notes explaining what was happening and what help we could provide.

Sometimes an employer has to look at the business and if the employee isn't able to provide evidence; even after informal and formal meetings/warning etc. Then at some point you have no other choice"
recruitinghell,femx59k,t1_femwg9a,1579271913.0,"I think all of the above makes sense. At the end of the day everyone who works is paid to meet certain criteria, if that criteria is met then some flexibility is always needed. 

Every member of my team (including myself) has a different start and end time; but we all work the same hours weekly; it was just to allow for those who needed to, for example, do school runs. But as a team we cover from 7am to 17:30pm so we are aware that at some points we may have to help out each other if urgent things come through.

Works really well for my team, sounds like it does for your too!"
recruitinghell,femwvwq,t1_femu6nv,1579271723.0,"Haha that's funny. It wasn't just the appointments; an example - texting me at 8am on a Monday morning to say they had an appointment that morning that they forgot about. Saying they couldn't come in because their partner took their flat keys and she was 'locked in the house.' Leaving her work laptop at the bus station and not realising (the bus company called us!)

Plus this person was referred to occupational health, they were given information for mental health advice. They chose not to take any of that, or provide any evidence of what the appointments were for (not to me, or HR or occ health.)

The notion that no one tries to take advantage of the system and they are all genuinely 'sick' is so naive!"
recruitinghell,femldkv,t1_femk6ci,1579261267.0,"That's true. I did have one of those once; who seemed to always need to go to the doctors!

Eventually HR and I agreed they would need to take the appointments as leave (as I wasn't seeing any medical notes) and sure enough they stopped having as many 'appointments' ... they were always at the end of the day too so should have noticed that earlier!"
recruitinghell,femfn3t,t3_epwief,1579253001.0,"Yes, but it's always the job not me. As in the business have realised they can't afford new staff, or they split the workload with existing staff.

Sucks when it happens!"
wholesomememes,femdv6k,t3_epsmzq,1579250424.0,So true... I always wonder if Moxley (my cat) gets bored of biscuits and chicken but then if I do give him something different he looks at me like 'what is this wench?!'
vanderpumprules,femcmpz,t1_fem6sra,1579248732.0,"My thoughts exactly! If people are still watching then why cancel?!

Although do think the new cast are boring... Personally I'd prefer to see more of the original cast, including your good self!"
recruitinghell,femcg9k,t3_epu4ib,1579248494.0,"It totally depends on the job, I manage a reception team (two part-timers/job share) so if one of them has a doctors appointment or whatever it has to be approved as I have to find someone to cover (can't leave reception empty). I also manage 4 other people (2 teams of 2 people) but they don't need cover if they aren't in as it can be picked up the next day or whatever (I manage the office support functions in an office)

So yeah, I'd be fine with them leaving for family events; both the parents in my team left early/came in late when their kids where in their nativities before Xmas.

Yes as a manager I need to ensure my team is here and workload is met. But I am a human at the same time!
