mintmobile,ffi0cci,t3_ep7o4e,1579961174.0,"First, let me say.... My family has been with a single cell phone carrier for 19 years, and we have just started porting the whole family over, one member at a time, to Mint.  Thus far, zero issues and I have no complaints.

I've been a Mint customer for about a month now, and I referred my daughter to Mint via the Refer A Friend through my account dashboard.  We activated her phone last night, again, no issues.

I am not seeing any pending referrals, nor rewarded referrals in my dashboard.  Will I get the credit for this referral since I don't see anything in the pending column?

And secondly, since I got a Trial Kit with my daughter's paid kit, will the activation of the Trial Kit's full plan SIM, give me credit for that also?"

In fact, a referee almost lost his life, since the pea was stuck in his whistle.  He then invented a new whistle that is in use today.

Brisket, incidentally, is the only thing you can legally smoke in Kansas City. For burnt ends, slow cooking is the secret. The burnt ends you eat today might have been cooking since the '50s.

Practice using cotton balls and ashes from your grill/fireplace.  Once you can successfully do it, then start moving to natural materials.

You'll find the speed, pressure are just like a bow drill, in that it is more art than science.  And once you ""get it"", it becomes really easy.

apple,ff95eau,t1_ff91y1y,1579705248.0,"5G is a standard, and not necessarily a frequency.

And 250 GHz is way up in the spectrum... it's not a mobile friendly environment frequency in today's technology stacks.

Most phones today have antennas that are multiplexed across multiple frequencies from 600 MHz to 2500 MHz... (as low as 450 MHz and up to 5.6 GHz for some instances....).  So you have to maintain duplexers, combiners, self induced noise, diversity antennas, LNA's, PA's, etc....

Physical space is a limitation and electrical noise is too.  You'd be amazed as what phones from an RF perspective do so that people can enjoy their likes and thumbs up.  LOL"
