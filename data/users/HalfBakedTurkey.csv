mildlyinteresting,ffoqbrm,t1_ffmzm0n,1580080461.0,"Where can you buy a weeks worth of groceries for under $12 (Canadian)? Let’s go through a basic sandwich:
Tomato/Lettuce/Bread/Baloney/Mayo or Mustard. 

Tomatoes = 1 per day for 3 meals x 7 = $1 x 7 = $7
Lettuce = $2 for a head for maybe half the meals = $4
Bread = $2.5 / loaf x 24 slices or 12 sandwiches. So 1.75 loafs x 2.5 ~ $4.5
Mayo / Mustard is $5 for about 30 sandwiches so ~ $4 on condiments.
Balcony = is like $7 for something that could last 10-12 meals so call it $14
Add that all up 3 sandwiches a day will cost you $33.50 and that’s a shit fucking sandwich."

As far as strategy for war I’m torn between: make the enemy fight for every inch to the bitter end, or if defeat is inevitable and the other side has to keep prisoners in reasonable POW conditions (clothed, housed, fed) then it may be more advantageous to surrender and have them dedicate resources and man power to accomplish this.

I didn’t mean to degrade “cogs” as we cannot all be wheels. it was a question to see the difference between going straight to university vs military. In university there’s a somewhat feeling that if you graduate with good standing you’ll be a “wheel” or in other words a managerial type person. Personally I’m a cog.

You answered my question perfectly because I always thought the notion the military provides “great opportunity” was somewhat BS. I’m sure it provides great discipline and leadership skills but if you want to apply to a law firm or tech company, it probably doesn’t provide the right qualifications for those positions. Correct me if I’m wrong but do you think that the military trains you to be more of a cog rather than a wheel in the proverbial machine that is the economy?"
AskReddit,ff86ee0,t1_ff72qet,1579667279.0,"That’s really fucked. Because, I imagine, if you don’t have specific training in a field you are interested in then you have to start from the bottom of any industry you’re interested in. So those “benefits” do make sense in the short to mid term. If you’re a Medic, Engineer or even a cook in the military, i’d Suppose, you are a more qualified worker than say a combatant of any nature. Like a SEAL team member, who is supposed to be one of the most elite soldiers, doesn’t necessarily have any skill in any business model for a company right? Don’t know for sure but logically it makes sense in my mind. Probably bad example because they most likely make a lot of bank compared to other enlisted soldiers and get given good jobs for their service. Anyway, long story short, can someone ELI5 why I’m correct and/or incorrect on my assumptions."

We were given a food allowance of $150 per day! Both me and my coworker decided to just make pasta for the 3 weeks we were there to pocket the cash. Bag of pasta $7, pasta sauce $10, meat $25 for a kg. $3 for an onion and garlic was like $2 a clove. It was like $25 for one of those damn personal thin crust frozen pizzas! So anyway, add that all up and you get $47for 4 meals. So about $12 a meal on a very strict budget. Would have cost like $3 a meal anywhere else in Canada. Booze however was subsidized. More expensive than where I’m from but no where near the price increase to food. Managed to save about $100 a day from the food budget after the cost of my $30 a day of straight pasta and $20 worth of booze, which equates to 5-6 drinks."
