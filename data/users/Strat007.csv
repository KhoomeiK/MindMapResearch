Ever heard of the freeloader problem? Itâ€™s why true socialism will always fail (just look at the USSR). If someone who canâ€™t do something receives the same benefit as someone who can do something, that person who can do something will just stop doing, as it literally wouldnâ€™t be worth their time to do anything when they could end up in exactly the same place without doing that very thing.

facepalm,fc1tqi0,t3_efjeky,1577329434.0,"Generally speaking, freeze it for at least 48h, wrap the bottom with plastic bag between the tag and your fabric. Use a dreamer or other rotary tool to *very carefully* cut the elevated bump portion off around the edges. There should be two manual release tabs on the inside. Pinch these and voila!

Edit: if you do have a store nearby, just bring your receipt and theyâ€™ll take it off. If you complain about it you might even get extra stuffs (complaining nicely of course) :) good luck!"
AskMen,fc1ryt1,t1_fc1cvwl,1577327841.0,"I asked my ex girlfriend to wait a little because I needed surgery to not be a bloody mess (quite literally). Somehow that was my fault and we arenâ€™t together anymore because of it. 

Generally speaking, a man canâ€™t as easily ask women to wait because if she wants it, and youâ€™re not offering at that moment, for whatever reason, she can (not necessarily will) get it elsewhere, and quite easily. As a man, if a woman asks you to wait, you wait, or you do the job yourself because if you ask for it, youâ€™re a pig. If a woman asks for it, sheâ€™s empowered. 

*This is not a substitute for consent, ever, but it is important to at least be open and talk about*

Vir Das put it very eloquently in his most recent Netflix skit: part of the beauty of being a woman is that if you want it, you (quite literally) can just ask for it, and have a dozen people lined up at a momentâ€™s notice to pick from. A man, on the other hand, doesnâ€™t dare ask for it lest he be shamed as they do often are, called a pig, etc etc.

Edit: to the OP, if youâ€™re not ready to have sex with them, then it doesnâ€™t matter how soon they want it or want to wait, they arenâ€™t the one. But do yourself the favour of at least having the conversation if one of you is pushing for it and the other isnâ€™t :) you might be surprised at the response."
puppy101,fc1p942,t3_efoxsd,1577325395.0,Unfortunately when theyâ€™re young like that you just have to ignore them sometimes if itâ€™s off schedule and not potty related. Itâ€™s just a part of raising a young puppy (and one of the hardest parts)! Theyâ€™ll get it pretty quickly but giving them attention when then do it (and shouldnâ€™t) only rewards them for doing it.
