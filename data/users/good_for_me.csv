Seroquel is going to affect your serotonin, which governs appetite, so I'd suggest taking notes for a few weeks on how you're feeling, what you're craving, etc. and see what healthy modifications you could make, if necessary. And keep in touch with your doctor, of course. Good luck :)"

Meeting her was so beneficial to me as a moody teen because I better understood why I was the way I was and so different from my family. If I hadn't had the option of meeting her, I think my growth and understanding of myself would have taken so much longer.

But adoption happens for so many different reasons. I understand the need some people might have to ""close off"" that part of their life once they put a child up for adoption. I would hope that they'd at least provide some health information to the agency/adoptive parents, though."
