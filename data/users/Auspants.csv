None of the steps they have mentioned in that article will address the real reason for the overwhelming majority of long term homelessness in Western countries: severe mental illness. It doesn't matter if you counsel these people, it doesnt matter if you put a roof over their heads, unless you nuke them into vegetables with medication or lock them up then there will always be a percentage who are roaming around.


>isn't that good enough for you or are you opposed because it is against your puristic ideology where you just can not give people things or they will turn into.


If you're going to just put words in my mouth then at least come up with some that arent the same old bs drivel that always gets parroted. 


THERE WILL ALWAYS BE HOMELESSNESS TO SOME EXTENT, not because of lack of homes or jobs, but because of the plethora of issues (mental illness, drugs, other dependency issues) with contribute to the problem. Likewise in Australia there will always be vagrancy to some extent with some generations of Aboriginal peoples because they're culturally conditioned (perhaps even genetically) to move about.


If a country claims to have totally eliminated homelessness then they're either manipulating data, sweeping the homeless under the rug, or both.


I'm 100% in favour of more social services and funding devoted to helping people get back on their feet, I also believe that mental illness should get a lot more funding than it currently does (it's not all as sexy as basic depression and womens issues), but i'm not even remotely naive enough to believe they've sorted this shit out.
