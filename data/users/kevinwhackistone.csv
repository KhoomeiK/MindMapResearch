technology,ff3s7e2,t3_erd274,1579547712.0,Joe Biden is a bad person.  He’s also stupid.
todayilearned,ff2h0u3,t1_ff2az8f,1579505769.0,"I don’t understand your point.  This specific story about Asimov was before strict screening of donated blood.  The risk in 2020 of catching a disease (especially a serious disease) from the actual blood, not some weird reaction to transfusion in general, is very low."
Instagramreality,ff1ieob,t3_er2eh2,1579479709.0,"Why aren’t people like the girl embarrassed?  Why are they so immunized from questioning their decisions?  I feel like these are traits of some kind of opath, be it soci or psych.

Is there really that much money in posting such awful, uninteresting content?  If so, I want $ for the reply I’m writing right now."

Your baby, your choice."

aww,fecqjib,t3_eo6njp,1578980944.0,"I think the temporary stress the dog is feeling is worth it.  Probably made those girls’ day.  I don’t think every situation must adapt to the dog.  Sometimes dogs can be service dogs even if they aren’t service dogs just by being cute and getting showered with affection/pets and making people happy.  As long as this isn’t it like a daily thing, I’d be cool with it if it’s my dog every once in a while."
SandersForPresident,fe7woce,t1_fe6ivss,1578919985.0,"No twitter, no trump.  It’s 2020.  While you’re 100 percent right, the old and the rural are on social media much more than people realize.  He built his entire political career on Twitter.  Being Trump and having the apprentice were the foundation.  Twitter was the catalyst.

But also, yes, don’t get hopes up.  Vote.  Vote like hell.  And vote your ideals.  Enough of this electability bullshit.  Bernie would win.  Warren would win.  They’d have to completely and utterly fuck up to the seventieth power for them to lose, even with the electoral college horseshit.  So vote for them.  Not Biden.  Not buttigieg.  Because you don’t get back to the center from the extreme far right by electing the center right.  That’s not how math works.  Elect the solid left.  The center’s time will come again, as it always does.  It’s just not now."

sadcringe,fcv75zf,t3_eiyzct,1577996048.0,Only type of person that makes someone do this has done much worse.
AmItheAsshole,fcpbghm,t3_ei40zr,1577857146.0,"It’s odd that there’s a prevailing opinion of “social media is toxic and bad for everyone,” but the people who choose not to have it as part of their lives are labeled strange.  Can’t have it both ways."
terriblefacebookmemes,fc4kp4k,t1_fc2dh08,1577419500.0,"Omg I can’t believe this sub exists.  I’ve never seen it before but here’s what I’m hoping:  it’s about the retards that hate rap, like a music genre that is equally “dumb,” are possibly racist, and always say “rap is crap” or any variation of that.  It’s been horribly annoying for many, many years."
