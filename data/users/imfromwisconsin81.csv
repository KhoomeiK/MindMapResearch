GreenBayPackers,ff74nlc,t1_ff6lppz,1579641043.0,"I think it's a fair statement to start *thinking* about it. I don't think it needs to be this year, but possibly next at the earliest, but two seasons at the max. My thoughts:

\- He's going to increase how prone he is to injury, due to age and previous injuries (""healed"" or not). He doesn't seem to move the way he used to, possibly due to unresolved injuries. He didn't have a great year sack-wise, nor yards loss through sack. 

\- His accuracy seemed to have slightly slipped this year. While this is objective as I don't think the stats tell the whole story of the quality of his receivers, he did seem to be more inaccurate than years past on hitting open receivers, or tight spots. He overthrew Jones numerous times this year, which is just shocking.

\- It'd be important to have one of the best to teach a draft how it works, the system, etc. I'd like to hope he'd do that (similar to Brady/Garoppolo). Plus, getting a draft in for understanding MLF's structure would be critical as he continues to build & refine his strategy."

Some dogs don't get over the fear of the fireworks. On nights like that, we give him a couple calming chews, his favorite toy to keep him busy + a special treat and he retreats to his favorite spot in the house. he isn't forced to go out.

\- kept an eye on him as soon as he came in the house, and lifted him the second it looked like he was going and took him out

I actually wonder if Rodgers is dealing with some physical ailment - like a previous injury (or injuries) didn't heal properly or something; he isn't moving like he used to, and his accuracy is off.

GreenBayPackers,fck6wqj,t3_ehifvl,1577718280.0,"I think this kid is going to be great as a #3, but not sure about a #2 for next year. 

I feel that sometimes he gives up on balls a bit early (not nearly as bad as MVS) and I wish he'd finish his route strong. I dont think his height is being taken advantage of either (although, with Rodgers inaccuracy on some of these balls I can't say for sure) -- although it definitely was on point for that fingertip grab for 6  yesterday (!!!!!).

I'd like to see 1-Adams; 2-someone new + Lazard sprinkled in; 3-Lazard + Kumerow sprinkled in; 4-someone new + Kumerow depending on situation.

We need someone stronger as a #2 than what we have today, as Lazard isn't it yet.

Kumerow seems like he comes through on big plays, but isn't getting enough snaps. He reminds me of Edelman SO MUCH, and I think he could be a real asset. He gets good separation, and yesterday he was wide open on a few plays downfield (especially when Rodgers was trying to throw it tight for Adams or Graham). I know he's only on a 1-year, so I hope he gets re-signed and put to good use.

I'm not sure on TE position other than Graham needs to go -- I don't think they utilize this position enough to put that much money into the position for hands."
