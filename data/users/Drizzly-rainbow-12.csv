BipolarMemes,ff8jkb8,t3_es819y,1579681479.0,Isn’t this the truth.
BipolarReddit,ff6tv8q,t3_erq7sq,1579634771.0,"With lamictal (like with most p-drugs), there is a sweet spot. This happened to me too at 200mg, but at 100mg I’ve got no cognitive or other side effects."
addiction,ff69n2y,t3_ervxsc,1579622366.0,"Congratulations on being 6 years clean, that’s a huge achievement.

However, think rationally here - is an individual more or less likely to fulfil their potential drugged versus sober? Statistically. 

It’s a rhetorical question. 

It doesn’t matter whether your brother-in-law attributes his apparent success to drugs - drugs have nothing to do with it.

He is *currently* successful, in spite of drug use. If he keeps using - it’s a downward spiral. Some drugs harder and faster than others. 

Trust me. I know this, because I’ve lived this."
addiction,ff66wd0,t3_ertx9e,1579620567.0,"I am so sorry to hear that you’re feeling this shit and are tempted to use. No-one should make you feel shit about yourself. 

HOWEVER - take it from me (ex-CM addict), if you use you will spiral so quickly and so deeply into depression, however you are feeling now will seem like a respite.

It’s not a painless “way out”. I know, because I tried. Many times. It makes everything worse.

If you are feeling nihilistic and lacking in self esteem (are you depressed?), please seek more appropriate support. I find exercise helpful. Anything else but using.

I know how (my) addict-brain works. Please don’t use how you currently feel as a reason to give in to it.

Good luck and I really hope you feel better soon."
bipolar,ff5pmp0,t3_errded,1579604951.0,"I hated abilify, worst med I’ve ever taken - but it works well for some.

Good luck, hope you feel better soon"
bipolar_irl,ff2z8jj,t3_erbxj7,1579529323.0,Agree 100%. Mania is pain and poison.
BipolarSOs,fekqxn2,t1_fekb1wk,1579205768.0,"To the OP, I am really so sorry for your loss. I hope you are appropriately supported. 

As someone with BP1, I can attest to this post being spot on. 

The brain perceives physical pain. “Mental” pain isn’t any less real. Same source.

I have two proper suicide attempts on my medical record (before being treated). It isn’t a conscious decision, it’s just a split second solution to escape a tormented mind. 

I wish you all peace."
bipolar,febh2z1,t3_eo8j77,1578958704.0,"I used to, but it made my mental state so SO much worse over time. It was do (whatever it takes to stay stable), or die.

This illness is brutal. It takes some serious discipline to manage it properly IMHO."
BipolarMemes,feaiatg,t3_eo7xae,1578949123.0,Lol 🤣
bipolar,fe17jww,t3_ene9bv,1578823457.0,You could always go during a depressive episode - and not leave the hotel room. That’ll teach them 🤣
BipolarSOs,fdy1eam,t3_enbzpo,1578775041.0,"I’m really sorry you have to go through this.

I’m the BP one in my relationship (married). I would consider your BPSOs behaviour to be “standard”. That’s not to say it’s not inexcusably shit, but I don’t know anyone with BP that would not be able to relate.

Before “getting stable”, I was heavily in debt and in ruin. HOWEVER - since taking meds, getting sober and doing everything in my power to remain stable (consistent exercise, sleep, good diet, counselling, etc.), I’ve turned that around. 

So, its possible, but only with a lot of treatment and hard work. Without treatment, I’m sorry to say there is zero chance. 

Good luck."
BipolarSOs,fdxw85a,t1_fdxrr3i,1578773517.0,"I’m really very sorry to hear that. That’s devastating :(

I’m afraid it’s not uncommon for BPers to cheat on their SOs when manic. Mania makes you reckless, impulsive and it robs you of insight. It can certainly make you a heartless prick. It’s horrible for everyone involved. 

I don’t know what’s right for you. If a BP person is not well managed - and it takes time - I think it’s selfish to be in a relationship. Us BPers need to get our shit together FIRST, otherwise this illness just devastates lives all round. 

I hope that your ex-BF gets his shit together and gets stable for a better future for himself (on his own first). Just know that what happened was probably illness and hold your head high as you rebuild your soul (with the right person for you).

Take care."
BipolarSOs,fdvqd6a,t3_en0pxa,1578750276.0,"I’m so so sorry you’re having to go through this. As someone with BP1, I can say this is very likely illness. The shut-down of emotions and suddenly not caring, not to mention the conspiracy theories etc. are characteristic of mania. It may have been brought on by stress. 

I don’t know what’s right for you, I’m afraid I’m medicated and I still have breakthrough episodes once in a while. My wife has stuck by me. But it’s certainly not for everyone.

I hope everything works out for the best for you, the other posters being SOs will have another perspective that you may find more helpful. 

Take care and good luck."
bipolar,fduo506,t3_en2gh2,1578736118.0,Just adorable!
bipolar,fdsbjlx,t3_emyzln,1578698822.0,Thank you - this is one of the most interesting things I’ve ever read!
BipolarReddit,fdsb0r9,t1_fds8wwa,1578698473.0,"Thank you and yes, for sure. Coincidentally, it is one of things that has been playing up in my mind recently, then I saw your message. 

I guess let’s try to be understanding, everyone has their own issues to deal with and we don’t always know where people are coming from, but I agree - on the face of it, without explanation, it sucks.

I hope you feel much better soon."
BipolarReddit,fds82gs,t1_fdqzenb,1578696475.0,"Dude, I’m sorry you had to go through this, but as someone who has also had some totally whack psychotic experiences, this actually made me laugh."
bipolar,fds6qyp,t3_emxfwu,1578695612.0,"Can’t believe you wrote this. This is EXACTLY where I’m at. Was feeling so normal and positive for 6 weeks, then I just crashed. Now, I don’t want to talk AT ALL. 

Reddit is my solace right now, because I can interact without speaking."
BipolarSOs,fdo2yjl,t3_emdjx9,1578597932.0,I’m BP1 and lithium is my silver bullet. It’s my “normal” drug. So glad this worked out for you both.
bipolar,fdmw1cw,t3_em3tjb,1578568445.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that man. 

I don’t know if this will get through to you, but here goes anyway: I’ve been suicidally depressed and had more crisis interventions than I can remember. Every. Single. Time - I couldn’t go on. I felt like I was gasping for my last breath. 

I know the pain and suffering. 

However, I’m not there anymore. I’m on meds and exercise regularly. I don’t drink or take drugs (I also used to be an addict). My mental state still goes to shit sometimes, I’ve had relapses and I still need urgent help from time to time, but my life is immeasurably better than before. There is no comparison and I’m obviously extremely grateful I’m still around. 

Even though it doesn’t feel like it right now, you will feel better, but you need to get urgent help so that you do (if possible).

Take care man and stay on here for support."
BipolarReddit,fdkhj4n,t1_fdhzls9,1578504002.0,"I’m really sorry you’re going through such a rough time, but I’m glad you do at least have *some* support in person.

As you say, there is also everyone here - we all understand this without further explanation and are here for you. 

I hope you are feeling a bit better today and that things are improving bit-by-bit for you.

If anything changes and you find yourself going down again, please please reach out before it becomes a crisis. 

Take care"
bipolar,fdhnpy9,t3_elg6j3,1578426518.0,"Keep it up! Exercise is the ticket for me. It’s obviously not a cure, but it certainly helps."
BipolarReddit,fdhg5t0,t1_fdhg0iq,1578421943.0,"Thank you for getting back to me. Do you have some support? Do you have any professional help? I really hope so. 

I always sleep terribly when I’m unwell. I hope you continue to improve and please, please, get some help."
BipolarReddit,fdgiv46,t3_el2m09,1578398624.0,To the OP: how are you doing today? Please take care of yourself and reach out in any way if we can help!
bipolar,fdf925t,t1_fdf6xxh,1578356149.0,"I agree it’s disrespectful and it would piss me off royally too - but I don’t know that it means he doesn’t respect her generally. 

I think he is probably just acting selfishly like a teenager and not thinking straight atm. 

To the OP: I’m sorry you’re dealing with this, I understand your sentiments 100%."
BipolarReddit,fdf8mnb,t3_el2m09,1578355854.0,"I’m so sorry you’re suffering right now. I’ve battled suicide numerous times and I know how damn hard you’re fighting to stay afloat. 

I also know how fragile our thinking is at times like these and we can’t always do it alone.

You need urgent professional help. Do you have a p-doc and/or can you reach out to a local mental health crisis team? 

We are all here for you, but we can only do so much behind a keyboard. 

I’ll be checking in again, please get help and let us know you are OK. 

You’re in my thoughts today."
addiction,fdf46jj,t3_ekzn34,1578352904.0,"I’m really sorry you’re collateral to someone’s meth addiction. Meth addiction is all consuming. 

I agree with the poster above, the best you can probably do is to offer yourself and if/when she is ready to open up to you or to accept help, then to help her in any way you can. 

Don’t *confront* her via text. If you do, she will just lie, lie, lie (addicts lie to themselves the whole time). You’re unlikely to get anywhere. It may sabotage any chance of helping her down the line. It’s not personal. 

I hope she is able to get through this. It’s *possible*. But, accept that you may not be able to help her. The stark reality is that most IV meth users die several years after using. If it’s that desperate, I don’t know what to suggest. She may need urgent professional help - we can’t do that behind a keyboard. 

Good luck and please protect yourself and your mental health in this process as well."
bipolar,fczc1ay,t3_ejeq0y,1578097886.0,"IME alcohol and bipolar don’t mix. Nothing destabilises me faster than alcohol (or drugs).
I guarantee you will only feel better if you cut down or better yet, cut it out. Alcohol is completely anathema to stability. 

I know that’s much easier said than done, but I think this is sound advice - if nothing else."
addiction,fcz4zee,t3_ejapxx,1578093775.0,"I’m sure it’s *possible*, but it seems unlikely. I had to hit rock bottom. I suspect the majority of addicts do - whatever that is for each individual. It’s part of the process of recovery from  addiction that consumes any and everything."
bipolar,fcypi0d,t3_ejas74,1578084452.0,"This is timely and I feel this very much as it’s my wedding anniversary. A lovely sentiment, thanks for starting this thread."
bipolar,fcyoscg,t1_fcybjea,1578084055.0,"The picture is gold dust :)

Untreated bipolar is devastating, but I think BPers are also some of the most creative and genuinely empathic people, which I imagine lends itself very well to teaching. I bet you’re great at it."
addiction,fcuysm6,t3_eiz45i,1577991219.0,"Thank you man, this has made my day. CONGRATULATIONS to you and your wife!"
BipolarSOs,fcfy6vf,t1_fcbrkjh,1577634762.0,"Don’t shut her out entirely. I understand completely where that comes from - like an isolation tank, you’re probably trying to eliminate all background to make sense of your own thoughts, but from experience that never works. It won’t help you to make sense of things.

If she can help you process things, then let her. If she can’t and you really need some space, then it sounds like you have enough insight to at least let her know how you feel - maybe ask for space for a bit, explain where you are coming from, but don’t shut her out entirely, since it’ll cause her unnecessary pain and it won’t help you."
bipolar,fcactp0,t3_egs9vk,1577566940.0,"That’s really evocative, what an amazing painting!"
BipolarSOs,fcabmsv,t3_egu87m,1577566247.0,"I’m really sorry for you. I don’t know anything about your relationship. It may be truly over. I have no idea. But I believe him or her when they say it’s because of the mental state they’re in. 

I’m BP1 and I’ve definitely sent exactly those sorts of messages before. Pretty much word for word. 

I think it is perfectly sincere to say one’s head is so messed up that you can’t accommodate someone else. I used to think that included my wife. Now I understand that the solution is not to undermine my marriage, but to get my head in order and to get things back on track. 

That may or may not apply in your case. I have no idea, but either way, I’m really sorry you have to go through this. I hope you can stay strong and whatever happens is for the best."

addiction,fc3z4ah,t3_efr33d,1577402376.0,"I’m an ex-addict. Please don’t let a lapse turn into a relapse. Lapses happen. Try to learn from this, it sounds like alcohol was a trigger and in the early stages of sobriety you need to be particularly vigilant and to have lots of coping strategies on hand e.g. no drinking, groups, exercise etc. Whatever works to keep you sober. 

As shit as you may feel, this isn’t a big deal. You can move forward easily and before you know it, it’ll be another 3 weeks sober, making 6 weeks with 1 brief lapse. 

So just keep moving forward."
