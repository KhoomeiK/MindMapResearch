politics,fffckvt,t1_fffauc6,1579880986.0,"There are a lot of articles written about it but Toys R Us was bought by Mitt Romney and Bain Capital in 2005. From that point forward, it only existed to make investor returns.
> When Toys R Us was purchased, its new owners tethered that $5 billion of debt plus annual interest payments of $400 million to its neck. Finance executives justify leveraged buyouts by claiming that they allow ailing companies to become leaner and more financially nimble in a way that protects the business and its workers. But how could Toys R Us innovate or change course while weighed down by that anchor?
>In practice, these deals favor the equity tycoons who help themselves to enormous bonuses. Simultaneously, their new possessions are left holding debt they cannot pay. An otter cracks open a clam before discarding the shell, and so do these firms: Toys R Us owners reportedly walked away with more than $200 million.

>The shell is the American worker. Once private equity squeezes out whatever dividends it can, too often the businesses close. The shuttering of Toys R Us' more than 800 stores will mean the loss of at least 30,000 jobs, including 1,600 in New Jersey.

>Worse yet, Toys R Us notified its workers that their severance plans were being nullified. 

>In recent weeks, Remington, the 200-year old gunmaker, and Winn-Dixie, the popular supermarket chain, filed for bankruptcy protection. Both were acquired by private equity executives that loaded them up with unsustainable debt. Their closings will create thousands more lost jobs.

politics,fffbdkm,t1_fffalrn,1579880227.0,"Yeah, I mean I was just simplifying the example for the sake of the discussion. 
Ford’s greatest contribution, or at least what history will give him credit for, was the assembly line and how it increased the productivity of the normal worker. That increased the value of workers who specialized in certain skills greatly. You could view the digital revolution similarly to the industrial revolution of Ford’s time. The problem is that the barriers for gaining those specialized skills has increased tremendously. Corporate America realizes that. It’s one of the reasons “coding boot camps” are popping up everywhere. It’s lowering the bar needed to develop those skills to fill the new jobs."

That’s the crutch of the issue. These companies are artificially inflated by investors over and over until either they have outlasted the competition or just bought it out. Toys R Us is a great example. It was always profitable and was well run. Investors turned sour on it because it wasn’t making the multiple percentage returns that Amazon could. It wasn’t because Amazon was better. It simply wasn’t as good as of an investment."
