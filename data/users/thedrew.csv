Even if most people wouldn’t sell human hide, a company would enter that business if there was a market for it. The reason there isn’t one is long ago we regulated murder and desecration of corpses. Now there are still legal killings (defense, assisted suicide, war, executions) and some legal actions to do to corpses (embalming, cremation, medical study). But what is allowed and what isn’t is a group decision we make through our government. 

We don’t just do this about useless things like corpses, we do this for useful things like water and air."

urbanplanning,fdkkzx9,t1_fdke6so,1578505738.0,"The short answer is JFK, but the long answer is not-JFK.

For many years teenagers were eager to don hats as an expression of maturity. However this changed with the introduction of pomade. Pomade, most famously Brylcream, uses mineral oil and beeswax to style hair and is sun and wind-proof. It was a popular alternative to macassar oil which is made of palm oil and would drip in heat.

(Side note: Those bibs still found on the backs of plane and train seats are called antimacassars and were created for this reason.)

Thus in the 1920s it became fashionable for college men to go about hatless outdoors. Using pomade allowed young men to style waves into their hair, which a hat would muss. Also, this was an intentional expression of youthfulness, intimacy, and marital availability without being scandalous. The modern equivalent for men might be sleevelessness.

During the Second World War servicemen almost exclusively used pomade to style their hair. John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the first presidential candidate from this generation. While he did sometimes wear hats, the media made a lot of fuss over his youth, good looks, and hair. However, men still often wore hats through the 1960s.

What really did hats in was the explosion of youth culture that began with the baby boomers. Rock and roll music was mainstreamed youth styling (hatlessness, slicked hair, etc). As hair-expression steamrolled into the 1960s counter culture movement, hats became a mark of being old. In the then-new youth culture old was very unfashionable (i.e. uncool). As a result baby boomer men were unlikely to ever own a hat more formal than a baseball cap."

It wasnt until mapquest replaced oral directions and paper maps that people came to rely exclusively on numbers. “The” could have been dropped at that time, but the convention was established.

When I sold my condo the buyers objected to a few things that I fixed myself with little effort. One was a switch plate in the attic which was missing a corner and made it possible to see into the electrical box a little. They said it was an electrical code violation, and I suppose it probably is, but it seemed like a dumb thing to bother with. I went to the hardware store and bought the cheapest white plastic faceplate they had. The difference between one that matched the existing one and the cheapest one I could find was $2, but at that point I couldn’t fathom why I should pay for anything but the lowest. If they want something different, let them buy it. 

That was $2. But if the repairs were substantial, my emotions and mindset would be the same. I’m also moving and buying a house, doing your repairs for you is an expense and inconvenience I am not motivated to give attention and concern to."
