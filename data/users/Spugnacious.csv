jobs,fewluya,t3_eqoa35,1579414005.0,"Ugh.

First of all, get your work done, get it done on time and do nothing else. Don't volunteer for stuff. Don't try and get promoted. Don't work late unless you are required to. Keep your head down and try not to get noticed too much. The more visible you are, the more likely you are to be a target. For anything. Downsizing. Extra projects. Special meetings. Stay busy, look busy, try to be invisible otherwise.

Second, develop some good work friends. People you can see here and there during the day that you can trust and blow a little steam off with. It's unbelievable how much easier a work day is when you get to work with some people you like.

Please note that I'm not telling you to be a social bunny. That goes directly against rule one. But you do need a support team there that can give you a laugh or some one to vent to and even occasionally a hand with work when you get shafted. Also, note that work acquaintances make excellent references. 

Three, get out there and start looking for a job. Pronto. There's no shame in working in a toxic shithole. There is shame in staying one second longer than you have to. It doesn't have to be your dream job, but try to at least make it a lateral move. Roughly the same salary/wages if possible, or close enough to not matter much. Be sure to weigh in all factors too. Is it a shorter commute? Is it a better culture? Do your work friends recommend it? Does it come with perks?

Four, take some time in the evenings and build yourself a nice lunch and snack for the day. Seriously. You need that break, you need to eat, so you might as well make something that you look forward to eating. Put a little effort into your lunch and savor it and if you have to eat at your desk be sure to put in headphones and a little sign that says 'ON LUNCH' so people leave you the fuck alone. 

Five, have your exit planned. What is your goal here? Are you trying to get severance? Do you need to retain work relationships? Or are you comfortable burning it all down and pissing on the ashes. (Not recommended, but sometimes called for.)

Six... speaking of perks... take advantage of yours. Does your office have sick days? Make sure you use them. ALL of them. Max out your health plans. Get glasses, massages, physical therapy, psychological counselling. Everything you need. Anything they foot the bill for, you take advantage of it. 

Hopefully that will help get you through until something better comes along. And something will. Have faith. :)"

Screenwriting,febqqsx,t3_eocw4q,1578961636.0,"Well, it's depressing as fuck. Which, I suppose, was the point.

The mother seemed a bit cartoonish to me. She seems to actively dislike/blame Damian for everything that has gone wrong in her life but we don't have any backstory there to understand why. 

Several of the characters seem to stutter. That just might be your writing style. Take a look at that and just make sure that's how you want them to sound.

I'm not sure the title matches the story. Hysteria seems to designate something other than what Damian is going through, which clearly seems to be some sort of schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder. 

And it ends abruptly out of nowhere. I literally scrolled down several pages in confusion. 

But, it's not bad. You do get a very good sense of just how brutal Damian's life is, how much pain he is in and how awful mental disease can be. I think it needs a bit of a rewrite and maybe some editing but there's some solid meat here to work with."

And that's the point. All those good memories come from that relationship. You loved him and he loved you and you had 11 wonderful years with him. 

It's good that you remember him, and remember what was. You are honoring his memory and him. And those memories make you sad because of the absence of what was there.

So like I said, there is no getting over a cat like that. You will remember him until the day you die. What you can do is get a new cat. A scared, lonely cat in a little shelter cage. A cat that needs someone to love him that he or she can love back. Take that cat home and start making new memories. 

Your old cat would want that for you."

AskReddit,fdell02,t3_ekt5n3,1578341605.0,"This is actually a serious question for me.

I have severe sleep apnea and clinical depression.

So I have not just one, but TWO valid medical reasons to sleep through my alarms and be late for work. Add in that my work is a 45-50 minute commute and you can very easily see my problem.

A lot of times I have woken up utterly exhausted, looked at the clock and realized I should have been on the road 20 minutes ago and just decided to take a sick day. There have been days where I decided to just bear the pain and drag my ass in to work where they essentially view me as the problem child that can't get his shit together.

AskReddit,fd3yr2d,t1_fd2wmdq,1578162835.0,"Two years ago I drove down from Ontario Canada to New Orleans. The only reason I left was because I was running out of money.

To be fair, according to the locals I came at a perfect time weather and travel wise. (I arrived at the end of May, and all the big festivals had just ended and the hot weather hadn't started yet.)

The city is like nothing else I have ever seen. Architecture from a lost period of time. The cemeteries, the trolleys, the people, the booze everywhere, the friendly people... all of it!

And oh my GOD the food there is AMAZING. BEYOND AMAZING. I had the two best meals of my life there. Nothing else even comes close to what I had.

Yes, there is a lot of homeless there, and hurricanes come through and fuck shit up with regularity, and apparently in summertime it's like living on the surface of the sun...

But I love that city. Love it. I physically miss it.

I will be going back as soon as I can. I wish I could retire there.

**Edit:** For those asking, one of the meals was at Jaque I'Mos and the other was... I'm not sure what it was called. It was a nameless tourist trap in the french quarter and they had a crawfish boil pot in the window filled with spices. They might as well have set a bear trap, because once I smelled that I briefly lost consciousness and when I recovered I was sitting at a nice little table with a menu in my hand.

At Jaque I'mos I had Godzilla... which is a whole softshell crab stuffed with more crab and crawfish, breaded and deep fried and served over fried green tomatoes. It is as decadent as it sounds, and I left stuffed to the gills.

At the nameless tourist trap I had a deep fried oyster poboy and a beer. The bread was fresh and soft, it came with home made tartar and seafood sauce and a simple lettuce and sliced tomato topping. There were a dozen deep fried oysters, and they had come out of the ocean that morning. They were perfectly deep fried, hotter than hot and far too many on the poboy for me to actually close up the sandwich.   


It was utter perfection. Pure bliss. I was eating and making little Homer Simpson moans of pleasure.

Right next to me was a small family, two small children and two adults. The parents had ordered baked and raw oysters with a pitcher of beer and the kids were nibbling on some french fries. The parents looked fairly tired, but the moment they started eating they both just let it go, closed their eyes and savored their plates of oysters.

At one point the little girl started to fuss as they were halfway through their dinner. The father just looked over at her and simply said 'Do **NOT** ruin this.' And she gave him one look and quieted right down.

I need to go back. I really **\*NEED\*** to go back. We have some decent restaurants around here, but nothing like what they have in New Orleans."
