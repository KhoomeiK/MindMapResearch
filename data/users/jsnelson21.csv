I am okay with this idea, i just don't know anyone at this current point in time that i'd be willing to partner with"

Most people just seem to downvote others when they mention they want to invest in real estate, protect their investment and property.

Thanks for replying, i wouldn't lend against my 401k as i have the cash on hand since it was the money i was going to use to purchase my initial property (still deciding if i am going to go all in on being a landlord). 

1. I haven't been to any local REI meetups, but i can understand. I would say that i have rough $10k to lend
2. I think i'd still have to check in and make sure progress is being made even if it isn't the largest amount of money in the world."
