I think the move to adjust signature requirements on recall elections from 10% to 25% of registered voters during this gun control push.

He doesn't only represent those who voted for him. 95% of the state is not an insignificant sum. If major American cities can declare themselves sanctuaries for illegal immigration. How can it be wrong for the counties of VA to declare the same for a constitutionally protected inalienable right? The laws will go to court and receive a hearing.
