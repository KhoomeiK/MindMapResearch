Maggots used in wound therapy are a specific kind, intentionally placed, and wrapped.  We actually kept our maggots (and leeches!) in the hospital pharmacy.  These are too large to be the kind of medical maggots used. Clear case of myiasis."

To give some background, I had a few big traumas early on life and as a result I tend to dip into nihilism some as far as my outlook on a lot of things.  

I think people get riled up about things that don't matter a lot.  Humans aren't that important.  We're here for a bit, then we die and we're forgotten, so mostly I just try to enjoy the time I have.  No one will think of me when I'm gone, or remember who I voted for or that I lived or suffered or had joy or loss in my life.  

Most people think differently, but I generally don't think along social norms, anyway.  I don't mean that in an edgy way - I just find myself not able to understand the things people do a lot.  So I just try to not involve myself.  It's a mess, like I said earlier - I just don't feel like wasting my time with the distractions we've been given from the people who control the world at this point.
