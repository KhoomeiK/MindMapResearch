>A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, said a Legion of Merit was given to Capt. Will C. Rogers III for ″exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service″ during his command of the ship from April 1987 to May 1989.

>The ship’s weapons and combat systems officer, Lt. Cmdr. Scott E. Lustig, was granted two Navy Commendation Medals, Quigley said.  
>  
>One award was for his ″meritorious service″ during his May 1984 to December 1988 tour aboard the cruiser. The second was in recognition of his role during an engagement with seven Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988.

When trauma to the brain occurs, several things can happen.

The direct injury to the brain is called a *coup* injury. This is damage to the brain at the point of impact (the trauma to the head causes the brain to impact the skull).

You can also get a *contrecoup* injury - this is when the opposite side of the brain then bounces against the back of the skull.

Either of these injuries can damage brain tissue. This can be in the form of swelling of the tissue or of something called ""diffuse axonal injury"" - micro-shearing of nerve cells.

In any event , the injury to the central nervous system more or less ""overloads"" the system and higher level functions - like consciousness - shut down.

There's more to it than this, but this suffices as a basic explanation."

hamsters,fepc4ua,t3_eqam20,1579316908.0,"Ok, first things first - Relax!

Okay, now that you've taken a moment, here is what you will do. Step one is to remember that the most likely outcome here is that you will get your hamster back. Step two is to put food and water out in major areas of the house so that the little ham has something to eat and drink while they are on the lam. A fed and watered hamster is a happy hamster that can be found.

Now that you've taken care of that - Hamsters love tight, dark spaces. They make great hiding spots and they feel safe there. When my hamster disappeared when I was a kid, we found him asleep snuggled against the counters and the stove, safe, protected, warm and comfortable. So make sure you check the nooks and crannies to see if you can find your little ham.

Go looking around at night. Hamsters are active during this time and you'll be more likely to find her during that time.

Finally, you can certainly try a humane trap - [a bucket with soft bedding in a setup like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkB7nUtQoKM) can safely secure her for transport back to the cage. Make sure that your last step is securing the cage to ensure that he can't get out again.

Good luck, and relax! You will find her. It may take a few days but you'll find her. Lots of love."
