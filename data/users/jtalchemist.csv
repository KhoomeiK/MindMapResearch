DMAcademy,ffijnih,t3_etfamm,1579975459.0,"HP, attack bonus and damage are the easiest dials to adjust mid encounter imo, HP being the one I most commonly fiddle with. I've had to scale up enemy health more often than not tho because I regularly underestimate my party. Occasionally I've dropped atk bonus or DMG dice if they're up against an encounter that's too tough and they're getting slapped around. I do this in increments of 1 or 2 for attack bonus and go one dice size at a time for damage."
DMAcademy,ffiiwcq,t3_etgtdk,1579974946.0,"IDK imo don't pull any punches here. The players are overextending their characters and have been warned, so give them the challenge they're asking for. Maybe this is when they learn about death for the first time. Maybe they come out victorious but it's a real close shave. If you scale down the difficulty here just so they can achieve their goals, youre not really doing them any favors. Sometimes victory comes at a high price."

For instance, with my current group, they were all complete newbies to d&d so I just said they had been working as caravan guards and got to know each other on their most recent job. They met their story contact on the same caravan and I just started them right on the quest throwing them into the action."
DMAcademy,feai8ho,t3_eo4hpk,1578949084.0,Worst thing you can do with a bunch of rp novices is ask them to rp with each other. Best thing to do is take on the role of engaging NPCs and create scenarios in which they can discover the personality of the characters they've created. Give them hard choices so they can decide what it is that they value. Throw lots of different personalities at them so they can figure out how they deal with different kinds of people.
DMAcademy,feagu03,t3_eo9hu6,1578948595.0,"Numbers is definitely what make guards scary. A single dude will get squashed by the party but if they alert their allies, your players better be ready to run as fast as they can and hide quickly."
DMAcademy,feaghm0,t3_eo4u6c,1578948465.0,Pretty sure the description of a flask of oil has rules printed for damage with it. My players fucking LOVE using weird items for damage. I started out improvising but discovered there are actually printed rules anticipating that kind of usage.
DMAcademy,fe9bbxf,t1_fe6ip68,1578936038.0,"Based on what I've read so far from the other comments and your examples of his behavior, it sounds like you've got a class A narcissist in your group. This kind of player is never satisfied to take turns with other people or value what the other players are doing, and tends to feel personally slighted when shoehorned into any kind of plot action that wasn't their idea. This kind of players ideal game experience is holding the DM hostage by having them wrack their brain trying to come up with reactions to their increasingly chaotic and self centered behavior. Essentially they treat the gm like a simulator robot slave, without any regard to the effort being put in by the gm or other people in the group, and without any regard to human dignity. As soon as the spotlight goes off of them, they get bored and try to come up with any possible way to get it back on themselves, no matter how destructive, pointless, or foolish. They also have ZERO ability to reflect on what they've done, see themselves from anyone elses point of view, or think about how their actions affect the rest of the group.

I warn you very seriously, remove this kind of player from your group as soon as possible or watch the group die."
DMAcademy,fe98d02,t1_fe64a7z,1578935302.0,"That's such a bullshit response. Players like that almost always end up ruining game groups if left unchecked, speaking from past experience. In my group that I'm running I had a long discussion with my players at the start talking about the collaborative nature of d&d and how I'm not trying to run a game where a bunch of free agents with a loose association are constantly robbing and fighting each other, and that the game would be story/combat focused and team play would be a necessity. They haven't been perfect angels by any means, but at the end of the day they make an effort to work together because I made my expectations super clear, and the very present danger to their characters requires their mutual support."

Ask him if he even really wants to play and let him know that he doesn't need to be there if he isn't enjoying the game or is willing to contribute in a constructive way. You're running the game, and if keeping the game healthy means cutting a player, sometimes you have to do it. If it's a personal friend, let them know that you're still friends and want to continue doing other stuff together, but that them being in the d&d group isn't working out."

It's a good part of game design because the human brain is designed to feel good when you overcome something difficult. Do you think the designers of dark souls sat down when they made their game and said ""let's make sure every moment of this game is fun."" Because they didn't. They sat down and intentionally made on of the most frustrating, agonizing challenges ever seen in the world of video games because they knew the right kind of gamer would love it. And they were fucking right. Challenge is important. Sometimes your players will feel moments of extreme frustration and loss. That's what makes it worth overcoming in the end. Otherwise you might as well just sit around and do improv story telling with your group, nothing to lose there and it's a lot more ""fun"""

DndAdventureWriter,fdcvjid,t1_fdcshe9,1578285532.0,"Just thought of a few more details that might be relevant that had slipped my mind

its not so much a city as it is a very large town, around 6000-7000 residents. 

there is a keep at the center of town which most civilians will be trying to evacuate to

the military force of the town was recently weakened slightly because the lord was discovered to be evil and corrupt; a portion of the keep guard were complicit in his treachery and executed summarily. the slightly less competent constabulary now makes up the majority of the defensive forces."
DndAdventureWriter,fdcuzrj,t1_fdcs4gy,1578285078.0,My plan is for them to easily breach the walls somehow and make the focus on fighting off the enemies who are going after civilians
DndAdventureWriter,fdcuwir,t1_fdcshe9,1578285005.0,"They are level 5 currently and I'm pretty much planning to use homebrew enemies so I'm not too worried about figuring out CR for encounters and such. 

Things I have in mind so far: 

-the enemies need a way to get inside the city quickly so that the combat doesn't become focused on wall defense. possibly a fireball launched at the gate to blast it open.

-the party will fight some kind of commander in the final encounter which would essentially rout the remaining cultists and leave the army to mop up the remaining undead mob. 

I'm also definitely hoping that the city will survive because the invading force won't be too massive, but I definitely want to have a focus on mitigating civilian casualties. The party has a pearl of power which is the target that the cult is trying to seize, but their plan is to draw them out by massacring the innocent, plus I'll have the incentive of the city leaders asking them to help defend with a promised reward."

DMAcademy,fcy57e7,t3_ejb0r9,1578075000.0,"How are you running a game with such a weak grasp on the rules? 
Not trying to make you feel bad or be an asshole but knowing the rules is one of the absolute most important aspects of the game. You're not going to use them exactly to the letter all the time but at the very least you need a firm understanding of how the class features of your party members work.

YouShouldKnow,fcse0yj,t1_fcs8f6o,1577915215.0,"The whole idea behind IP law is to give the creator an appropriate amount of time to profit off of it before it enters the public domain. A lot of people don't think much about the concept of public domain, but essentially the idea is that individuals who are members of a public both contribute to and benefit from the greater populace. A person who is a member of a societal population gains the collective benefits and security granted by that population. So necessarily any works created by a member of that population must give credit to the fact that they were created as a result of being part of a whole. The conditions of American society that Walt Disney was a part of, including it's economic, defensive, and cultural advantages, helped lay a foundational environment within which his works were created. And so, the idea behind IP is that within a capitalistic society, creators are allowed to profit from their own creations for a limited time before they are shared openly with the public. However, in the case of Disney, their company grew to such an immense size that they were afforded the rare advantage of a massive legal department and lobbying groups which could leverage the American legal system in a way which the average American citizen could never hope to. And they used that advantage to continue to retain control over the original imagery even though members of his family are no longer even controlling members of the company (although I believe some of his descendants are shareholders). 

When you compare the IP law pushed by Disney for media to any other kind of intellectual property like technology, it makes no sense. For example, the tech behind the original NES entered the public domain a few years ago and other manufacturers were allowed to replicate its technology and make legal clone consoles with any modifications they saw fit. That console was created in the early 80s and Nintendo had ample time to make massive profits off of it. So why should Disney be allowed to retain sole control of a drawing of a mouse from 100 years ago?"
YouShouldKnow,fcralzr,t1_fcrabeq,1577899177.0,"As a point of comparison, if you invent a manufacturing technique, IP law only protects that technique for 10 years! That's a mere fraction of the lifetime of the creator! And more than enough time for them to profit hugely from it. IP law reform is massively needed in this modern age of media."
YouShouldKnow,fcrabeq,t3_eihn7c,1577899059.0,I would like to take a moment while we're all here to point out the absurdity of our Intellectual Property laws surrounding creative content. Walt Disney is long dead yet the lawyers employed by his corporate empire have fought tooth and nail every year to continue changing the law so that Mickey mouse doesn't enter public domain. A single monolithic entity has robbed the public of what should rightfully belong to them so they can keep making absurd amounts money off of a 100 year old image.
DMAcademy,fcof1rd,t1_fco63vl,1577830670.0,Exactly.
DMAcademy,fcnw0lz,t1_fcntn44,1577819557.0,"The other issue I thought of in this vein is that from a game design perspective, the Witcher is a solo-play character. He can do a lot of different things to keep himself alive and deal with a massive variety of situations because the games' design demands that. D&D specifically avoids that kind of thinking because it assumes team play. Each player's character can cover a limited range of problem solving because it's meant to be impossible to do it all on their own. So being a character who can swordfight well AND shoot crossbows well AND cast a bunch of useful spells AND track monsters down AND create a million potions is just unrealistic within the framework of D&D."
DMAcademy,fcnskuq,t3_ei2jup,1577817615.0,"one thing commenters havent mentioned so far is Orcus, demon prince of the undead. He is one of the insane lords of the Abyss and his only motive is to turn all living things into undead. He recruits followers by promising them eternal power in undeath if they serve him faithfully, so cults worshipping him are some of the most likely to create undead chaos. There's a lot more info on him and the other demon princes in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes."

DndAdventureWriter,fdcvjid,t1_fdcshe9,1578285532.0,"Just thought of a few more details that might be relevant that had slipped my mind

its not so much a city as it is a very large town, around 6000-7000 residents. 

there is a keep at the center of town which most civilians will be trying to evacuate to

the military force of the town was recently weakened slightly because the lord was discovered to be evil and corrupt; a portion of the keep guard were complicit in his treachery and executed summarily. the slightly less competent constabulary now makes up the majority of the defensive forces."
DndAdventureWriter,fdcuzrj,t1_fdcs4gy,1578285078.0,My plan is for them to easily breach the walls somehow and make the focus on fighting off the enemies who are going after civilians
DndAdventureWriter,fdcuwir,t1_fdcshe9,1578285005.0,"They are level 5 currently and I'm pretty much planning to use homebrew enemies so I'm not too worried about figuring out CR for encounters and such. 

Things I have in mind so far: 

-the enemies need a way to get inside the city quickly so that the combat doesn't become focused on wall defense. possibly a fireball launched at the gate to blast it open.

-the party will fight some kind of commander in the final encounter which would essentially rout the remaining cultists and leave the army to mop up the remaining undead mob. 

I'm also definitely hoping that the city will survive because the invading force won't be too massive, but I definitely want to have a focus on mitigating civilian casualties. The party has a pearl of power which is the target that the cult is trying to seize, but their plan is to draw them out by massacring the innocent, plus I'll have the incentive of the city leaders asking them to help defend with a promised reward."

Not trying to make you feel bad or be an asshole but knowing the rules is one of the absolute most important aspects of the game. You're not going to use them exactly to the letter all the time but at the very least you need a firm understanding of how the class features of your party members work. And you need to read the magic rules section of the book."

YouShouldKnow,fcse0yj,t1_fcs8f6o,1577915215.0,"The whole idea behind IP law is to give the creator an appropriate amount of time to profit off of it before it enters the public domain. A lot of people don't think much about the concept of public domain, but essentially the idea is that individuals who are members of a public both contribute to and benefit from the greater populace. A person who is a member of a societal population gains the collective benefits and security granted by that population. So necessarily any works created by a member of that population must give credit to the fact that they were created as a result of being part of a whole. The conditions of American society that Walt Disney was a part of, including it's economic, defensive, and cultural advantages, helped lay a foundational environment within which his works were created. And so, the idea behind IP is that within a capitalistic society, creators are allowed to profit from their own creations for a limited time before they are shared openly with the public. However, in the case of Disney, their company grew to such an immense size that they were afforded the rare advantage of a massive legal department and lobbying groups which could leverage the American legal system in a way which the average American citizen could never hope to. And they used that advantage to continue to retain control over the original imagery even though members of his family are no longer even controlling members of the company (although I believe some of his descendants are shareholders). 

When you compare the IP law pushed by Disney for media to any other kind of intellectual property like technology, it makes no sense. For example, the tech behind the original NES entered the public domain a few years ago and other manufacturers were allowed to replicate its technology and make legal clone consoles with any modifications they saw fit. That console was created in the early 80s and Nintendo had ample time to make massive profits off of it. So why should Disney be allowed to retain sole control of a drawing of a mouse from 100 years ago?"
YouShouldKnow,fcralzr,t1_fcrabeq,1577899177.0,"As a point of comparison, if you invent a manufacturing technique, IP law only protects that technique for 10 years! That's a mere fraction of the lifetime of the creator! And more than enough time for them to profit hugely from it. IP law reform is massively needed in this modern age of media."
YouShouldKnow,fcrabeq,t3_eihn7c,1577899059.0,I would like to take a moment while we're all here to point out the absurdity of our Intellectual Property laws surrounding creative content. Walt Disney is long dead yet the lawyers employed by his corporate empire have fought tooth and nail every year to continue changing the law so that Mickey mouse doesn't enter public domain. A single monolithic entity has robbed the public of what should rightfully belong to them so they can keep making absurd amounts money off of a 100 year old image.

DMAcademy,fcnw0lz,t1_fcntn44,1577819557.0,"The other issue I thought of in this vein is that from a game design perspective, the Witcher is a solo-play character. He can do a lot of different things to keep himself alive and deal with a massive variety of situations because the games' design demands that. D&D specifically avoids that kind of thinking because it assumes team play. Each player's character can cover a limited range of problem solving because it's meant to be impossible to do it all on their own. So being a character who can swordfight well AND shoot crossbows well AND cast a bunch of useful spells AND track monsters down AND create a million potions is just unrealistic within the framework of D&D."
DMAcademy,fcnskuq,t3_ei2jup,1577817615.0,"one thing commenters havent mentioned so far is Orcus, demon prince of the undead. He is one of the insane lords of the Abyss and his only motive is to turn all living things into undead. He recruits followers by promising them eternal power in undeath if they serve him faithfully, so cults worshipping him are some of the most likely to create undead chaos.
