apexlegends,ffclwfa,t1_ffbtasm,1579802236.0,It actually was fun for me cause I : t h o n k e d : my hardest to get the best possible outcome out of that shitty situation.
apexlegends,ffbfync,t1_ffbfpel,1579763586.0,Might as well go to everyone else who complain about glitches that respawn devs don’t normally fix (not like this) and say “no point in crying on reddit about it”
apexlegends,ffbf8nv,t1_ffbf5p0,1579762715.0,"Well, you might as well go to the other people who post the same issues they have with this kinda stuff and say the same shit to them. Also, you wasted your own time if you decided to stay and argue with my unwilling ass"

apexlegends,ffbf0h8,t1_ffbev72,1579762445.0,The pathfinder called me trash cause earlier in game I had to run into zone to get more meds. He got downed 3 times and I had to res him. He was still alive and almost full health and the ring didn’t do much and it was close but he left. I was about to get him but oof. The bang also just upped and left before that so I guess he had 2 go. But he did get downed so maybe not
apexlegends,ffbews2,t1_ffberac,1579762323.0,"Your right, man. Thanks for staying to point it out to me. I just planned so hard to get the best turnout and change my future but I underestimated the power of getting team shot and trapped in a death zone. Guess your right"
apexlegends,ffbet9h,t1_ffbe25h,1579762210.0,And I only posted this cause that was the last match I played before I was done with apex for a bit cause my fingers hurt. I wasn’t tryna get controversial I just hated this and I really hate these rings
apexlegends,ffbepx6,t1_ffbb7tw,1579762099.0,"I guess your right, then. I tried to plan my best to get the best turnout and I failed. I still don’t believe it’s completely my fault tho >:("
apexlegends,ffbei9u,t1_ffbcn8w,1579761852.0,"Yes, totally. The ring is too advanced."
apexlegends,ffbeagm,t1_ffbe25h,1579761608.0,"I did exactly that. Except, there was a pathfinder zip line closer to the ring that a squad who was pinning me down had used. I tried to use that but it was really late game and I got eaten by the ring. I wouldn’t say a “little ring damage” I would say “got destroyed in 4 hits” type of ring damage before I even made it off the zip. Also, read what I said before, and what I CONTINUE TO SAY REPEATEDLY"
apexlegends,ffbe6z2,t1_ffbdw4h,1579761496.0,"I tried to manage it the best I could and still got pinned. And that’s a bit on me but, I’m sure you don’t care and would rather continue being an angry online dude cause “your better than everyone”"
apexlegends,ffbe07d,t1_ffbdhra,1579761286.0,"Is anyone even reading what I said before? I gave my best explanation that I could. I was held down by 2 squads and I couldn’t get through neither of them So I had to stay true to my position and hope for the best. And I tried to escape but the the ring was faster and I got my ass eaten. Trust me, I tried the best option I could and I still got fucked up cause everyone was just camping. I always check the maps and am aware of my surroundings In this game. Getting immediately sprayed by 2 squads at the same time didn’t seem like a good option to me as I hoped for a little light to win or at least make it a bit further before that ring closed. And even after leaving the outside ring the caustic still stayed to make sure I was trapped"

apexlegends,ffbaex1,t1_ffba77p,1579757337.0,"This ring has been a Probleme for many more people who get either pressured into going in there or they just didn’t escape in time or they weren’t playing that much attention. Not just this ring, either. There are so many unlucky spots where you can get completely trapped off and forced to die outside of the ring. I just feel like they should block off those types of rings from happening and have less squads get costed a match cause of the ring blocking them off. One time I won a game by a squad who got blocked off from the ring and were completely helpless. Another time the same thing happened with me and a pathfinder and we tried to save them by giving them a zip to come up but they didn’t take it cause I think they thought it was a trap so I guess they’d just rather die to the ring. These rings can be a big probelem sometimes. I’m big mad"
apexlegends,ffba25q,t1_ffb80pv,1579756881.0,No I don’t spend money on free games >:(
apexlegends,ffba1b5,t1_ffb9w0t,1579756847.0,Even if I decided to take it to the tunnel like I should have before there were still 5 squads left and the path and oc were fighting other people and I didn’t wanna get in the middle of that and get fucked right in my anus so that’s why I had to take the other way. And then that’s when I just got super unlucky.

apexlegends,ffb9ov4,t1_ffb95u6,1579756413.0,"The thing is that I tried and I couldn’t. I wasn’t a pathfinder I was a bloodhound. I couldn’t have made it there any other way than an enemy zip line that was outside the ring and there were 2 squads holding me down and as you could see, i was only one there cause my squad left while they were downed. Not completely dead just DOWNED. So I was alone and really tried to get back in the ring but a caustic on one team was trying to snipe me and a path and octane were trying to shoot me. The caustics pathfinder made a zip and they escaped but the caustic of course took it to the ring but kept on sniping me. And the octane and path went the other way to the tunnel. I tried to sneak behind them but that didn’t work cause they were camping there. Literally waiting for me so I retreated and when I couldn’t go back, they left. And so, I decided that I would be a man, take the caustics pathfinders zip line and try to ride that thing inside the circle. Guess how that turned out"

Brawlhalla,ff9rjpe,t1_ff9r7ed,1579719553.0,"Last night I read some lore. Mostly of my mains like scarlet, jiro, mordex and Diana and stuff. And I read some stuff that didn’t make sense to me. Nobody talks about mirage but apparently she’s a time traveler? Either it was that I was up til 5 am and dog tired or I was just too stupid to understand but, some of mirages lore confused me. I read stuff about time travel and I think I made a connection to mirage and another legend that I can’t remember. Also i found out that ragnir is a 90 foot long I think dragon who takes a human form. And apparently he’s also from fang wild like ember."

Brawlhalla,ff9qlfq,t3_esbqae,1579718810.0,Someone made a character idea with just the lore. He said that sometimes when new legends come out they were sometimes hinted in someone else’s lore. So he found every single character name that wasn’t in Valhalla and he suggested characters that were in others lore. Like barron von evil stein (scarlets nemesis) and lots of others in other peoples lore that I can’t remember but the scarlet one was the one I wanted cause scarlet is one of my mains. And his theory is that all of the lore is connected and no character just has their own story. All the legends are connected somehow. With someone or something linking them all together
