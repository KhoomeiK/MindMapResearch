fakehistoryporn,ff70qb0,t1_ff6j1vo,1579638803.0,Well the film is set in the 80s and De Niro plays a talk show host so he's just providing commentary for his audience.
PrequelMemes,ff57eu3,t1_ff4crk2,1579582403.0,"Bro I even tear up when Heavy dies in like the second episode! It also breaks my heart when the clones acknowledge how expendable they are. Well not to me, brother. Not to me."

Whether it was confirmed to be condoms as well as dead rats, I don't remember, but I'm pretty sure all that happened."
movies,ff2q8mx,t1_ff2ejxr,1579519041.0,"There is a difference, but Leto apparently thought that would get him into the mindset of the Joker and help him achieve a good performance. That's why I'm criticizing that it was his choices on what and who Joker is rather than bad direction from David Ayer."
movies,ff2b36p,t1_ff28xaw,1579499273.0,"I don't agree, especially how Leto took a page out of Heath Ledger and fully immerse himself in the character to figure him out. Sending used condoms and dead rats to people was all him."

aww,feg82me,t1_feg482k,1579081485.0,"No I remember that's the ending because they go to the fundraiser and after they adopt the dogs. 

I went ahead and looked it up and this is the cold open, I couldn't find a video of it.

> In order to appear sophisticated, Ryan pretends to be ""completely devastated"" about Smokey Robinson's death. Jim and Pam catch him in the lie when they reveal that Ryan cannot be a true fan because he can only name one of Smokey Robinson's songs. Oscar reads on the internet that news of Robinson's death is a hoax and Jim finds that Robinson will be playing in concert only three hours away. They try to persuade Ryan to buy tickets, but upon learning how expensive it is, Ryan pretends to back out due to the opening act."

Pam: What do you feed her?


Kevin: Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!


Darryl: Is she sick? How are her poops?


Kevin: Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.


Pam: Does she smell?


Kevin: She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown."

StarWars,fdct6zr,t1_fdbpn7z,1578283622.0,"In TRoS, everything happened so fast. They tried to fit so much into one movie. Apparently they never gave JJ Abrams a chance to do a good movie, too much corporate meddling. 


I agree with you both, TLJ had a lot of great character development and very little story development, while TRoS had very little character development and went heavy on the story elements that it just became convoluted."

They took him away from his mother and showed him how powerful the Jedi Order was.
