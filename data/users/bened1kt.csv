Biohackers,ffo6ipg,t1_ffo24kz,1580074622.0,"As far as I know (which admittedly is not much) there is no single frequency our brain swings at. Different parts swing at different frequencies, and even individual brain regions swing in various frequencies at the same time. Hence the notion of “dominant” frequency. Isolating and determining the dominant frequency is quite a resource intensive process, especially in real-time. This might be the reason that no simple frequency display exists, at least I have never heard of one. Would be awesome though as a quick self-check."

The Oura ring doesn’t measure brainwaves directly, but derives brain state apparently (due to sleep lab studies) quite accurate from a few other measures.

You might also try playing isochronic sounds and with some practice it’s possible to judge your dominant brain frequencies based on how you perceive those frequencies."

karate,ffhmcfa,t3_etnxh7,1579942157.0,"I think the right exercise can assist in knee recovery. I suggest you talk to the teachers about it before you join and see what approach they have. In our Shotokan club, no one is forced into competition, and injuries are considered in all tests. There is no way around sparring though.
The advantage of Shotokan Karate in that regards over other martial arts disciplines is that in sparring leg kicks are not allowed.

You may look into support braces, but consider that taking the load off may also reduce the strengthening effect of exercise.

Personally, I suffered from knee injury (dislocated it while skiing), and lacked confidence in all related exercise for two decades. Karate training gave me back the strength and confidence, and I can now do most kicks properly, full ROM squats, currently working my way towards pistol squats. It’s very important to do the right exercise with the right intensity. Always keep knee tracking over toes, and don’t ignore sharp pain.

Also, I believe good diet assisted my recovery. Low-inflammatory foods, collagen, good fat composition, no processed/added sugar, no fried food. It took around 5 years to go from a clicking and painful mess to strong and fully functional."

Doing this for more than 20 years, but only recently discovered that there is science to it. Stumbled across it by accident as a teenager. I was a very aggressive and angry jerk at times, and blowing into a hollow tube calmed me down significantly. I also designed and built electronic oscillators and started playing harmonics and sound differentials over headphones and discovered that I could induce calmness or anxiety depending on the frequency. When friends came over, I made them listen to music over headphones and conducted experiments. I could put them to sleep and make them rip the phones of their head and freak out.

Posture,ffg8ebq,t3_ete5yo,1579900681.0,"As someone who has been working on posture since early teens and seen many therapists, chiropractors, personal trainers and martial arts instructors, I am convinced that you need to start from the bottom up.

If your feet are flat, it’s almost impossible to have “correct” posture anywhere above. The very first thing I look at when assessing someone’s posture is their achilles from behind. If I see an inward kink, it’s very often a sign for flat feet. Which is often a result of weak feet, because many of us walk in shoes most of the time. My most common advice is to walk barefoot as much as you can, to consider the foot as tripod, and press each of the three points (heel, inner ball, outer ball) into the ground, and active the arch. A key exercise can be the marble game: get yourself a jar of marbles, tip them out on the floor, then pick them up with your toes and put them back in the jar.

Next are the knees. Most common issue is improper alignment to the feet. Knees need to track over toes.

Next are the hips. Posterior pelvic tilt is the most common issue in modern society, due to so much sitting. Most common advice is to tuck the pelvis, flatten the lumbar spine. Hip flexor stretches, ab and glute strengthening often help. Shorten the ab section, don’t poke the belly out, don’t poke the bum out.

Expense the chest, pull the shoulders slightly back and primarily down. Breathe into the belly to relax the shoulders. If you feel your shoulders rise on the inbreath, there is surplus tension in the upper torso.

Flatten the back of your neck, push your chin back.

Imagine a string attached to your crown, and being suspended like a puppet.

In all seriousness, inhabitants of this sub love to tinker and get excited if it could explode, and most of us enjoy helping noobies, you will certainly find help here.

When powering anything with electricity, you shall make sure that you have 1. the right voltage, 2. the correct current type (AC or DC) 3. the correct polarity (for DC) and 4. enough current.

1. Your 12V rated fan will probably run fine with anything from around 3-14V, and it will run faster the higher your input voltage. Your 3S lipo will provide a maximum of 12.6V (4.2V per cell) when fully charged, so the voltage is fine. Higher voltage might fry the fan motor.

2. These fans all need DC, and a battery always delivers DC, so that’s easy.

3. Polarity. When powering electronic devices with reverse polarity, many of them release the magic smoke. Make sure you get the polarity right!

4. Your fan wants 0.1A, and your battery can deliver 5Ax20=100A according to the label. So that’s a thousand times more than you need. Which in the case of current is fine. Higher voltage is not good, but the device will only draw as much current as it needs, even if the source can deliver more.

Finally, consider how long you can run the fan on the battery. 5Ah means you can pull 1A for 5h. Or 0.1A for 50 hours. To keep lipos in good shape, don’t charge below 80%. If you run the lipo below 3V per cell (9V total) you risk damage to the battery. A practical way to monitor these  hobby grade lipos is to wire the device to the main connector (big, two-pole plug) and a voltage monitor to the balance port."

selfimprovement,ff6y5gy,t3_eryjed,1579637296.0,"I used to behave like that. Let me offer a concept and a few ideas that allowed me to move past that point:

There are multiple lines of achievement in my life, e.g. health, fitness, financial independence, social interaction, parenthood to name a few important ones. I want to progress each of them, every day. I realize that the progress made in the first 20-50% of my efforts for progressing each line yields the largest ROI. If I keep pushing beyond that point, I will still progress that line, but my efficiency and thus the ROI (benefit/progress per effort) goes down, so its smarter to hop lines and work on something else. So I need to pace myself, realize that point of declining ROI, and move on to the next line.

This also needs to take into consideration the human nature of single tasking. Our brain performs best when we are focused on one single task. When we are in the zone, in flow state. So I will aim to focus 100% on the current line, progress with all my power, and when the bell rings, I will immediately pack my tools away neatly, meditate for 30 seconds and move on to the next line. “OK google, set timer for 20 minutes!”

I consider myself rolling through my like a spoked wheel. All these lines are the spokes. I twist and tweak them, and working to extend them. If one spoke has more tension or more length than the others, the wheel will become an egg and the ride will be bumpy. It’s important to progress all lines evenly for smooth riding."

As you might know, character development is at the core of many “modern” martial arts schools and as such is deliberate part of the curriculum. I quote “modern” because e.g. Shotokan Karate is considered “modern” even though it was founded around 100 years ago, which is very young compared to many other style, e.g. Kung Fu which has its roots way deeper in time and originates from actually training primarily for war and combat.

A few of these people are very experienced in this odd behavior, and their job is to reprogram the new guys who feel totally awkward and overwhelmed by the experience. But eventually these new people realize that it’s actually fun and that they get better at it. They learn to express themselves and influence others.

However, until you get there, it’s OK to meditate in any other pose you feel comfortable. Even many experienced yogis prefer a cushion to elevate the hips and make the seat more effortless. A chair or a couch is fine when a backrest makes it easier for you, but note that an elevated spine helps us to stay alert.

We shiver and sweat in anticipation of the consequences of our potential failure, even though the worst that can happen is that the color of our belt doesn’t change. And then we come out at the other end and realize it wasn’t that bad, and that relaxing and enjoying the process is a viable option.

LifeProTips,fehkcof,t3_ep20yg,1579118309.0,"German here. At first, I would like to tell you that German cockroaches are not from Germany, but originate in Asia. They might have received their name because of their invasive nature..

Also, I would like to tell you about a recipe that I used in many places to eradicate those suckers: a router, maple syrup and boric acid. Take the acid (which usually comes as a powder, or premixed with some liquid bait, and mix it into the syrup. Then open up your router (or any other cheap appliance), and drizzle the mixture into the heat sinks of the device. Put the device into their path and plug it in. The heat and the smell of the syrup will attract them, and the acid will kill them. Empty and refill every week or two until gone.

Source: I live in Australia, and every rental unit I moved into was infested by those arseholes. I always left the building as the last German.

Weird side effects: they mutate in scary ways when poisoned. Extra limbs growing out of their heads, some start buzzing in strange ways or run in circles. That means your evil plan is working.

P.S. if I’m getting enough replies, I MIGHT upload some pictures of past missions."
selfimprovement,fehilbz,t3_eozvoo,1579117281.0,"Martial Arts. Being able to fight and stand up for yourself is a massive boost of confidence. Statistically, martial artists get into street fights a lot less often, probably because they have learned to avoid dangerous situations by conducting themselves in a powerful way. Also, the training forces you to be social, accept your own and others weakness and weirdness, and keep striving for your goals."
karate,fehh3jk,t3_ep4vge,1579116404.0,"Don’t feel bad about having less strength or control than your partner. That’s just how it is (for now), we all are on our own journey. Partnering with smaller or less experienced students teaches us control and humility.

Don’t hold the pad in front of your face. Brace it against your chest, abs or shoulder. Don’t have your arms in between pad and your body, but press the pad directly against your body. Brace yourself, get into a good stance, and breathe out when receiving the technique. You should be tense for a split second, and relax before and after. When training with much heavier and stronger partners, let their strikes push you back, and then quickly assume position again.
Remember that we are not practicing to hit pads in mid air, but we are practicing hitting body parts. So hold the pads right against your body to give your party a good target that teaches them the right distance.

If you are being hit too hard, tell your partner! If they don’t understand, tell your teacher. We all need to feel safe and stay healthy to come back to train tomorrow."

Less and the body won’t have enough for important pathways, more and it will ferment in the gut and feed critters I don’t need. So far the theory. I don’t claim ultimate wisdom here, but since I follow that plan, my physique has changed dramatically, from being borderline obese to so fit that random people ask me for fitness and nutrition advice after watching some of my performances."

I have done this plenty of time with quads and RC cars. Not just lured them back in, but given them a solid workout to boot with.

They are plastic, but they are by far the best sounding plastic didge there is, and the killer feature is that it slides and lets you adjust the key. Nice for beginners because you can find the key that suits you best, and great for experienced players because you jam with everyone/everything."
