While other sales people were just there to get the customers to buy (usually the most expensive product with the most spiffs) I just couldn't do that.

I never talk to a sales person unless I already know what I'm buying. It's crazy how half the time you can spend an hour researching a product and know more than half the sales people who sell the products do. I also never let a sales person in my house, that's just stupid.
