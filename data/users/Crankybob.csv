canada,fezh8zz,t1_feyfm3p,1579457328.0,"Alberta crude is currently 35$ a barrel. That's cheap. I believe it's the cheapest in the world but per barrel prices are weird to look up.  
Carbon taxes on oil account for all emissions created by that product. The same standards don't apply for manufactured products that emit via their existence. Clearly a double standard. Clearly targeted at Alberta's oil and gas sector. Standards not applied in kind to the rest of Canada's resource sector. If you apply emissions created and not potential emissions (in line with the east's manufacturing sector) then extraction and refining only accounts for 4% total of Alberta's emissions. Taxes assume crude at 100% potential emissions.   


Current pipeline production could be done with private investors in a day. We could have 6 pipelines paid for by business' that include Spirit Eagle. But because of federal bills made to prevent the construction of pipelines using constantly shifting goalposts we have to use tax payer money to buy out these projects. Taxpayer money provided by carbon taxes. Seems backwards to me.   


Finally the demand for oil and gas is going up. It will continue to go up as more switch from coal to natural gas (the cheaper and easier alternative). The 3rd world in particular would benefit from consistent cheap electricity. China, India, and most of Africa are the source of demand and we can help lower world emissions by selling them our crude. The world needs more roads (asphalt). The world needs more plastics (oil). The world needs more transportation (natural gas). I don't buy for a second that the world demand for oil is going down. Especially not the demand for heavy crude who's uses are parallel to none."
canada,feuj19r,t3_eq8f63,1579386961.0,We need a military that is both active and effective. It doesn't need to be gaudy and obscene. It needs to work. We've had such a pathetic turn out for UN peacekeeping missions in the last 6 years. Maybe even further back I just haven't looked into it. Look at the statistics. We need to contribute to the international community if we want to have our say.
canada,felrys1,t1_feignbi,1579229467.0,"This is the kind of shit we need to know! Honestly, Bombardier is incompetent at the best of times but they can really innovate. I wish we could subsidize them with something useful like military contracts for jet fighters or cargo planes. Have your cake and eat it too."
canada,felqg6y,t3_epthmn,1579228438.0,I like how Bombardier innovates. I hate how they produce. But as we all know it's going to get more money from taxpayers across the country to continue trundling along. Because 23 000 in Quebec trumps  280000 in Alberta.
canada,feepd7j,t3_eni0p1,1579038414.0,"How about we build spirit eagle? If first nations along the pipeline disagree then the first nations who want to build and own a pipeline should be allowed to do so. Oh wait, those along the trans mountain agree? WTF is the problem here? We need more piplines to reduce Alberta glut. We need competitive taxes to get exports to coal burning nations like China and India. We do not need some decadent cronies to dictate to first nations about how they should 'step in line' and 'stop resource development.' This nonsense is absurd."
canada,fecnx7c,t3_eoanbz,1578978681.0,I was really hoping that Trudeau was going to increase military spending but I see he'd rather deflect. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that this is more a universal ticking off to both Iran and America leaders. Fair enough. But the one thing it's highlighted is our inability to do something about it. I don't mean invade. I mean force projection. Fighting rebels armed by Iran. Pushing for more security in the region. Increasing our UN security commitments. Something to say we will not stand for this type of brutality. I guess we won't get that.
canada,fdz7l0r,t1_fdy8thw,1578787482.0,I never got the desire to constantly fall back from the Canadian public. I know it's not glamorous work without it's thankless attributes but it is helpful. We keep shrinking and shrinking. I don't want them to go into all out war but we can be very useful on a huge number of UN missions. We can do more. Not less.
canada,fdyuw12,t3_emsb2c,1578783851.0,"Well this article didn't age well for the Iranians. Well, not the Iranians, their leader. Iranians are pissed."
canada,fdyu2f1,t1_fdyn7nh,1578783577.0,I can't imagine that being the status quo. They are not regular individuals with standard backgrounds. The connection to the crown is enough to ensure some level of protection. But I imagine they will have all titles removed as we don't do that here (as far as I know).
canada,fdysvd5,t1_fdye3gf,1578783251.0,HA! needed a good laugh
canada,fdysg8i,t1_fdtpn1l,1578783108.0,"Ya, usually I hate the guy but this is a tough spot. I have empathy for him and I hope we can put politics aside for a minuet. This whole thing is tragic. It's made me want to join up honestly. Not because I want to go start a war but because it's made me think I could be helpful in some small way. I hope this never happens again."
CanadianForces,fdtof3y,t3_ea87u1,1578719725.0,I still want a split fleet so we don't run into these issues again. I know everyone here groans and complains but it seems more sensible to shuffle procurement. The f-35 has finally won me over but I still like the gripen.
CanadianForces,fdtke3h,t3_ecb1wu,1578718023.0,HMCS Wolfe and HMCS Montcalm as two light aircraft carriers based on the America class. I like that idea anyway. Not ever gunna happen but I still like it.
CanadianForces,fdskh0u,t1_fds9czx,1578704316.0,I was in school for awhile and tried to start a business. It failed hilariously but I don't regret it. Just sucks that I've got nothing to show and my resume has a large gap. I failed the fitness test and later found out I've got some kind of issues but they are mostly resolved. I just needed to take it more seriously (I took 'it's easy' a little too literally). Didn't fail the medical test. I'm trying to get back into working full time now so hopefully this year I can have a decent resume to show with proper contacts. Still want to join up but I really don't want a repeat.
CanadianForces,fds7x8z,t3_ek6gdr,1578696380.0,That attack made my blood boil. I tried awhile ago to join but I'm not fit enough or have a decent enough resume to get in. But I was on the website looking at potential jobs. Still not sure I have what it takes to excel.
canada,fdpso3p,t1_fdpou3l,1578638946.0,It could be in the middle of the day it's a radar lock not visual lock. You don't accidentally fire a missile near a civilian airport at something the size of a passenger plane in the middle of the country. Wasn't close to a boarder or any type of warzone. It's not a woops kind of system. It knows the difference between the type of things it's shooting at. But I'll take your point that the investigation is ongoing and some thing unexpectedly happen. I's happened in the past and user error is expected. But someone behind the device knew what he was doing.
canada,fdpaysh,t3_emen64,1578624123.0,Canada could for a start recognize the country of Taiwan as a country. Unless I'm uninformed about our doing so.
canada,fdp8r4a,t3_em4eyb,1578622650.0,I always get annoyed at Bombardier but they are still a cleaver company. the  Airbus A220 is a great plane and it's popularity is on the rise. Their customer satisfaction is abysmal however outside of planes. No idea why I'm saying this but there it is.
canada,fdp88hh,t1_fdp7k57,1578622300.0,"Either way we go about this we need a stronger military. I hope the end goal is to make Iran a democratic nation again. Hell, my future kids might enjoy the vacation destination if this all turns out well! But I'm a dreamer."
canada,fdp7001,t1_fdp3man,1578621470.0,"I don't think the cold war is comparable to these increased tensions. One would result in Armageddon. The other will result in, at worst, an invasion of a totalitarian regime. Were not there yet. I hope we don't get there. But nothing is the worst thing we could do right now. Just like starting an invasion of Iran. I'll take somewhere in the middle please."
canada,fdp6czt,t1_fdp395j,1578621047.0,"I think we can forgive our closest ally and trading partner. Forget, no. But lets no obfuscate Iran and America. One is a democratic nation who has been an unbelievably positive force on the world (even despite it's many fuck ups). Iran is a totalitarian regime that rules through fear and mistrust. They kill citizens and fund terrorists. Say what you will about America but modern America is not the same as Iran."
canada,fdp5wgp,t1_fdou1aw,1578620736.0,I don't think people are asking for a 'tit for tat' here. We can harm Iran without targeting Iranian citizens. No idea how though but if they need people I'm sure more then a few will stand up (myself included).
canada,fdoxli7,t1_fdouoc8,1578615192.0,We should do something but lets not target Iranian citizens. If this was a democratic nation MAYBE but they are just as vulnerable to the whims of their leader and not our enemy. Iranians are good people but that government is currupt to the core. If this was targeted it was a sovereign attack on not just us but Ukraine as well.
canada,fdov54t,t1_fdorx9v,1578613580.0,"Although I'm no expert I think even the most moronic soldier can tell the difference between a plane taking off from a civilian airport and an american fighter. It took off from Iran. It was a Ukrainian airliner. It was civilian airspace. I just don't see how two missiles is an accident. AA is a very precise weapon. A grounded plane or bus maybe. But from what I understand it's got to lock on. So my issue is, why is AA placed near a civilian airport? In the middle of Iran? Americans don't need airliners to attack cultural sites. 

Maybe I'm wrong and the report will tell us in the future. Until then it's just conjecture. But it's highly suspicious in so many ways it's silly to claim an accident."
canada,fdotuzz,t1_fdodx1p,1578612747.0,"I don't get why this is the go to response. Maybe there is another path we can go down but the alternative, nothing, is unacceptable. I'll be honest it made my blood boil when I heard. I'm sure I'm not the only one. In my mind we need a stick to wave and an ultimatum to acquire. Nobody wants to push towards a war but sitting on our hands is allowing this to happen again. Iran has been a bad player. Nobody can dispute this. Iran must change. I believe that is justice. How it happens I've got no idea."
canada,fdooprl,t1_fdokull,1578609494.0,Well one could be an accident. Two were shot. Sooo... not sure what that guy is on about.
canada,fdooj8m,t1_fdoji2s,1578609383.0,I agree completely but how? Best I can think of is an ultimatum that the leader steps down. The buck stops with him so the blame should as well. But we don't have a stick to wave of any consequence. We can't rely on America to help (plus that would just be a nightmare anyway as bad blood). More subtle options seem unreliable but I'm open to hearing ideas that wouldn't target civilians.
canada,fdolk9j,t1_fdohmtg,1578607604.0,"Our options are limited but I see your point. If demands for justice are not met for guilty parties then I'm not sure what else we could do that would be meaningful. Maybe cyber attacks on major government but that's just going to piss off the civilians.   


I hope America does not involve itself in this however. That'd be a god damn nightmare. Between the commonwealth countries of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and maybe a few others we could pressure them with an actual stick that's not backed by nuclear weapons. If we keep the 'good guys' clean from past interference we could push public opinion for actual government reforms. But in the end we still need a stick or it's just talk. Still, a shit situation."
canada,fdoj324,t3_elvpai,1578606163.0,If our government can untuck it's balls for a second and stand up for Canadians that'd be nice. It's really simple. The Iranian dictatorship must step down and give way to democratic government or we will escalate the situation. If they don't do something this WILL happen again. I'll join up if they need men. I'm sure I'm not the only one. As a Canadian I demand some semblance of justice.
SuicideWatch,fdmmgw0,t3_em3ktx,1578555579.0,I hear that. Every time I start to feel I can get a grip on it I crumble to a lower place then before.
SuicideWatch,fdmjz1q,t3_em3mfk,1578552704.0,Nothing to ashamed about taking a beat to reorganize. But a word of advice from someone who's been there. Don't spend the money on a vacation when it's use could be better put elsewhere. If you feel that you have some real fight then take it to them. If you need to reorganize to bring the fight then reorganize. Have you talked to your family about it? Or are they people who would not make you feel stronger? Not trying to pry. I've just been there. I fucked up and regretted it.
SuicideWatch,fdmdk0u,t3_em10tn,1578546442.0,"Cant say it gets better. Cant say it gets worst. But the waves between good and bad even out after some time. I don't know about you but life feels like your just spinning your wheels going nowhere in a rush. Life has nothing to do with pleasure and your destination might be driven entirely by your ego. What you want and what you've got will always be two very different things. So take a beat. Grab some perspective. Pick a target. It can (and should) be small. Close. Easy. But something you kinda want. Like reading a book. Or listening to an entire album. Then pay for it by doing something you don't want. Like cleaning your desk. Or reading another book you don't want to read. Distract yourself until you can gain some clarity on what you want. What you CAN do to improve and start there. Communicate when the things you wanted to happen don't. Rinse repeat.  


 Maybe you found some nugget of help in all that. Either way I wish you well."
SuicideWatch,fcphysd,t1_fcov05k,1577864825.0,Well said
SuicideWatch,fcpewjx,t3_eiejla,1577860996.0,Sounds like the kind of shit I would send if I was drinking. Shit behavior. I hope you didn't think it was a reflection on you. Nobody deserves to be cast down upon. For what it's worth you were the real adult there. Good man. The high road is lonely but it's deserving of respect.
SuicideWatch,fcpd88c,t1_fcomjow,1577859064.0,Keep playing for yourself. At the very least you won't regret trying like hell.
SuicideWatch,fcpd2u7,t3_ei4k2u,1577858895.0,When i was a kid me and my mom were both suicidal. One day we sort of talked about being sad on the ride home. Somewhere between the line we promised each other that we wouldn't do it if the other one didn't. 33 now. Every year it gets worst for me. But my mom is happy so that's good. I guess that's my reason.
SuicideWatch,fcpcx6k,t3_ei9t6q,1577858719.0,I'm 33. Same. It gets worst. But you discover new things. I've spent a long time learning about the world I live in. It's really a fascinating place. I'm just not really apart of it. The feeling of loneliness has gotten much worst as I've gotten older. But my social skills have improved enough to not be noticed overtly. Sucks to know what you are. Hope you can build better coping mechanisms then me.
SuicideWatch,fcpbx30,t3_eiaipw,1577857624.0,Not Christmas but new years. In the last 7 years 6 of them have been alone. Same with birthdays. Actually every other holiday. You'd think I'd be used to it by now.
SuicideWatch,fcpbjyq,t3_ei7cir,1577857245.0,"It's new years. For the last 2 I've spent alone. The last 2 birthdays I spent alone. I've spent the last 2 years without a friend in sight. With the exception of an ex filling about 6 months (and being hateful of me for another 6) I've spend the better part of 25 years alone. I don't see that changing. I can't remember the last time I felt hopeful about my future. Honestly, apart from 2 family members, nobody would notice. All I've got left is sadness and resentment."
depression,fcpb2xj,t3_e6qwmd,1577856762.0,Since nobody is going to comment on this I'll add that things just get worst. I wish I wasn't here. Not even a depression subreddit can take the time to pretend to give a shit.
WTF,fbm7wr5,t3_edusao,1576979842.0,At least he started with the head.
