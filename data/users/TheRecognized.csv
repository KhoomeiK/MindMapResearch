Could you be more specific about that?

>Economically inefficient unless subsidized as a public works project (See: highline in NYC)

So subsidize it then. We subsidize plenty of things already and you’ll see returns in a variety of ways, hopefully mainly in the form of healthier more productive citizens.

>Environmentally negligible impact.

That’s questionable. Right now there’s a bunch of cars driving too and from there everyday and trucks shipping the food grown other places there.

>Very top-down approach to city planning.

Could you be more specific about that as well?

>Use these spaces for goods and services, which is what working-class people need. Both to serve their needs and provide jobs.

There would be job opportunities as well if these spaces were used for indoor agriculture, and good healthy food is a good working class people need.

>Should I list more reasons?

If you’d like."
