pics,fdyo9v2,t1_fdymonv,1578781885.0,"Because toxic masculinity as a concept is much much deeper than “punches a wall”, it’s the dissection of the social and cultural programming that perpetuates the idea of “what it means to be a man”, “boys will be boys” etc. it’s mama Le because it’s palpable and easier to understand and break down when it comes to showing men how to be better. Bad behavior is bad behavior. This is modern day feminism 101. And for the record, there is a term for this stuff when it comes to woman, it’s old and has some shitty sexist roots but it’s called “hysteria”."

To what end? Debate you? Am i going to change your ideology with clear and concise reason? No, i am not so why bother, it’s easier (and arguably more fun) to just laugh at straw men arguments and move on with my day. I mean fuck, your entire comment was built in the foundation that there is no difference between expressing your emotions in a healthy way vs allowing them to bottle and build until they come out in violence (ie punching a wall). This is what children do. Grown ass men should do better and you’re transparent. So tell me, what do i have to gain by debating that?

You’ve already won this imaginary argument in your mind because you’re too closed off in your own ideology to even open yourself to the idea that maybe this post has a point maybe there’s a reason terms like “toxic masculinity” exist and terms like “female fragility” don’t. You don’t want to debate me, you want to beat your chest and feel good about what you already believe to be true, that’s evident from your very first comment. You can’t just turn the same argument around for something and apply it to “the other side”, “if a woman did this...” because those scenarios are not 100% exactly the same and there are hundreds of years of cultural programming that brought us to the point where it’s okay to criticize men for the way one might act.

But you won’t hear that. You were never going to hear that because all you care about is the fact that you want to be smug on some MRA shit and “winning” internet debates, so chalk up the W pal because i truly have no energy to engage further with a brick wall."

To go back to your original point, saying Outer Wilds isn’t “traditionally fun” because exploration and puzzle solving isn’t your idea of fun is not a defensible stance. I also wouldn’t separate the act of physically turning a page while reading a book from the experience of sitting down to dive into a story youre enjoying. Honestly based on that comparison it almost sounds like you’re saying the Outer Wilds isn’t “traditionally fun” because you’re not running around and shooting dudes and getting exp. you need to step back from this idea that “traditional fun” exists, because it doesn’t. Fun can look like shooting dudes and earning exp and also look like exploring strange planets and uncovering their secrets. It’s okay if that isn’t fun for *you*, but claiming that there is this a definitive version of *fun* is in of itself abjectly wrong. 

It’s okay for us to have different ideas of fun, but you have to at least open yourself up to the possibility that your idea of “fun” isn’t the end all be all for everyone else. That’s the disconnect here."
