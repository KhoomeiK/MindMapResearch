BreakUps,ffdzm2a,t3_esw26l,1579832897.0,"Back in high school I used to skateboard as much as could. I wasn’t the best but I would consider myself well above average at the time . Fast forward 7 years of a relationship and not skating for the past 5. I have Thursday’s off and I’ve skated every Wednesday night and Thursday for the past few weeks. It’s made me miss it so much and I can keep my mind off all this shit for hours meet new people learn new shit bust my ass and go into work sore. 

I can’t get back into video games as much as I’d like, I start to think to much and lose focus on the game. 

Go find something you used to enjoy but haven’t done in a while!

Cleaning my apartment also helps!"
BMW,ffaygub,t1_ff80d2w,1579747412.0,"Yeah man I sell BMWs I remember when the 5 series was redesigned and how much of an improvement it was from then f10 and how much I was blown away,  And how my customers were pumped, Now I’m working with the same customer who were the first to lease a G30. Time flew by."

BreakUps,ff77frt,t1_ff6ayro,1579642609.0,Yoo that’s literally identical to my situation that’s fucking weird. Like the timing and everything wow
skateboarding,felg1h8,t1_felbjot,1579221318.0,"I can’t heelflip and my body doesn’t agree with kickflip variations out of a FS 50-50. I never used to skate ledges when I was younger just flat ground because that’s all I had around my house. so I’m starting to dabble into different ledge tricks. I was learning BS 5050s after that which feel weird as hell. And I’m not comfortable enough to do anything out of them yet. My goal is to Trey out of a bs 5050 next week. Then I’ll start learning other grinds. 

I stopped skating for like 4 years and re started like 5 months ago it’s fun as hell re learning everything and doing stuff I could never do. I missed it a lot."
BMW,fec3646,t1_fe644z2,1578965977.0,"Not sure m340s and m550s haven’t come back off lease yet for me to have any experience with. But we had a training the other week and he said that BMW is considering M340 and X3M40is as the first line in the M division so they are technically Ms which frustrates a lot of BMW fans but whatever they gotta milk the shit outta the M letter. So I’m sure they will be expensive to certify. 

Yes if you were to buy a BMW a CPO is the best choice. Usually low mileage and have been checked over and go through a strict checklist of things it has to pass in order to be a CPO."
BMW,fe32usc,t1_fe0h9t5,1578845378.0,"Bmw salesmen here. He’s not wrong to certify an M3 is about $3,500 plus possible tires and brakes and whatever else it needs. (Almost always needs rear tires). And if the car has carbon ceramics forget about it. 

To compare a 328xi is about $1700 to certify. 

With That being said I’ve sold plenty of CPO M’s perhaps you’re market doesn’t support the want for Ms?"

skateboarding,fcsmcag,t3_eiozbs,1577919605.0,"I was young when I learned how to drop in so I don’t remember how challenging it was. But I have seen so many people eat shit dropping in so I’m glad I learned young, one of those things you don’t forget."
aww,fcsddyy,t1_fcsdbfc,1577914973.0,Go on....
aww,fcs38se,t1_fcrzv4n,1577910814.0,We got our kitten off Craigslist and our goal was to get her spayed before she went into heat. She went into heat earlier than expected I don’t know how anyone could deal with that on a normal basis.  It was not a fun experience.
skateboarding,fcs1c71,t3_eifgls,1577909894.0,That was karma for something lol only puddle in like 30 square feet
aww,fcp5gfd,t1_fcp43bk,1577851074.0,Nice.
Fingerboards,fcj2gv1,t1_fcif8ys,1577675624.0,Easier in real life too. With a trey it’s 90% the scoop of your back foot which makes the board rotate.  With a varial you need a combination of front and back foot. Same physics would apply to a fingerboard too.
