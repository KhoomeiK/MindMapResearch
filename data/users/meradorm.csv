Time to learn Finnish and move. (That and I want to go to the Moomin park someday.)"
suggestmeabook,ffgykf9,t3_etf7pb,1579918380.0,You might like A rebours by Huysmans. It was a pretty infamous Decadent novel during the Victorian era (it features in The PIcture of Dorian Gray). It's pretty much what you'd expect of Victorian Decadent novels.
todayilearned,ff83arm,t1_ff7onfb,1579664853.0,For the Russian film 9th Company they just took a lot of real army shit and blew it up because it was cheaper.
todayilearned,ff7kl2c,t3_ervx9r,1579651759.0,Reminds me of that creepytings chick who went around national parks leaving her shitty drawings.

(At least, the mood stabilizers seem to be working and they wouldn't do much of anything if I didn't have bipolar, eh?)"

AskScienceDiscussion,ff1mecg,t3_er0kbn,1579481585.0,"There needs to be well-funded, easily accessible, and evidence-based resources for pedophiles who don't want to offend and need help controlling their urges *before* they commit rape. Many trained therapists, inpatient treatment if necessary, closely monitored support groups, even voluntary chemical castration. I don't know what goes on in a pedophile's mind before they decide to offend but I like to think that most of them didn't wake up as complete monsters. (Though maybe they all do and it's not an accident of sexual attraction but a sick power trip for everyone. I don't know and really don't care all that much. I can't fathom the need to get off being so strong you'd be willing to destroy someone's life.)

As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, not getting raped would have...I can't even name the ways that it would have made my life better. I was a train wreck from a very early age and I never really found my footing in life."
DMAcademy,ff19qwg,t3_eqvcf6,1579476615.0,It's an art. I'm still pretty bad at it. Especially because you have to get a feel for how much direction your table needs. I tried to get sandboxier with my players for the last arc of my current campaign since I worried I was railroading them and they didn't take to it at all.

DMAcademy,ff0sezz,t3_eqy211,1579471851.0,"I made mine the embodiment of a death goddess. You can't kill him by ordinary means, so they'll need a special quest to defeat him. When I'm good and ready.

Of course, just making your villain immortal is a bit cheap (who among us has not used cheap GM tricks), but you can get away with it *if* you have a good in-story reason. I augmented mine by making other characters functionally immortal or at least getting second chances at life through similar means (some NPCs have had contact with relics that embodied a life goddess, her counterpart, and they all do things like resurrect the dead or cause constructs to come alive) so it's not just the villain."
todayilearned,fezz6de,t1_feyt70q,1579463421.0,"One of them wrote a memoir (or probably ghostwrote and seriously embellished) detailing the family history. If you're bored and have a lot of time on your hands, [here](https://archive.org/stream/memoirsofsansons00sansuoft/memoirsofsansons00sansuoft_djvu.txt) it is in English.

Tangentially related: there's a really good manga called Innocent that portrays the Sanson family. Not exactly in the most stable and level-headed light."
funny,feu93mv,t1_fetszl3,1579384300.0,As a churchgoer I promise you that you will instead need a check to escape being told that everyone's daughters are single.
AdviceAnimals,fescolj,t1_fes5gbg,1579363895.0,Time zones'll get you. I was in a game that ran over Discord. I was in interior Alaska and another guy was in Finland. Our game started at like 7AM for me and midnight for him.
AskAnAmerican,felxqek,t3_epqu7k,1579233598.0,"I can speak Russian so I guess I'm headed to St. Petersburg. That or Sweden, I really need a lot of hiking and natural beauty in my life. I also like traditional Swedish culture a lot (like medieval ballads)."
