I'm sure she doesn't want to force you to be a house husband. Just like you want her to be happy, she wants you to be happy too. You should talk to her and let her know that you're not happy right now and that you'd be more satisfied if you had a job. 

She can't stop you from getting a job (I doubt that she'd try) and once she knows maybe she can help support you in finding one. 

My partner and I have had the ""stay at home"" conversation before and at first both of us wanted the other to be a stay at home, then we realized it didn't HAVE to be one way or the other. Nowadays it's completely normal for both people to be working and providing, and there's no need for someone to stay at home (unless childcare costs and time come into play, then it's sometimes more valuable to have someone stay at home)"
