news,fcu4u3q,t1_fctys2u,1577972579.0,"McMaster is not the cheapest option by far, however they are the most convenient. 

If you need one super weird, oddball bearing to fix some clapped out piece of critical equipment, McMaster will have and can have it in your hands tomorrow. If you need to construct a one-off, their catalog is a wonderful playbook of parts to just pull right in to CAD as well. That’s why they’re not the cheapest, but the value of the service is often well worth the cost.

If you need large numbers of parts for production or constant use, though, you may actually be better served elsewhere, at least in my experience."

It would also be impossible to bathe in without injury. The bathroom would have an eye-watering, overwhelming smell of ammonia that would ultimately overcome anyone unfortunate or brave enough to walk in."

A bit odd, but I suppose it is what it is. 

Now the only exception was pokemon go. Holy shit, talk about an event. Half the campus felt like it fucking showed up for Pokémon go events."
