mildlyinteresting,ffflktv,t1_fffl64j,1579886591.0,"Nice attempt to defend your sexual harassment. That's what you did plain and simple. It's so easy to not sexually harass people, I don't understand why it's so difficult to just not say anything.

She knows she has a female body and people are attracted to her. She doesn't need a thousand thirsty people telling her.

The day a person can post a picture of themselves online without uninvited, clearly unwarranted sexual/physical comments will be a good day. It's easy, people."
StardewValley,ffd4upb,t1_ffczafj,1579813452.0,True! But hopefully all of it just allows him to potentially hire more artists and programmers and fund his other projects for years to come.
StardewValley,ffd4ng8,t1_ffd3bje,1579813338.0,Yes! 3 of the copies I bought were for others. I'm actually about to buy a 7th copy for someone.

wow,ffci4et,t1_ffbv7kh,1579799952.0,"I like this idea. They could work on healing the land, growing plants and trees, creating new life. Could turn it into another new zone/faction as well, by helping them. It would eliminate the eye sore and revitalize a vanilla zone. I'm sure it's probably not the most popular zone for leveling as it is, so I feel revamping it would be nice. One of the most exciting things to me about Cataclysm was that it changed the map of the world forever."
StardewValley,ffceukb,t1_ffamztn,1579797946.0,"Sorry! Stardew Guide. Logo is green with a white chicken.

It's missing a little bit of stuff, but I rarely use the wiki now."
StardewValley,ffa86h3,t1_ffa306j,1579729765.0,"I downloaded an app that has most of the wiki info in it. It also has an npc locator so I can put the date and time and it'll tell me where someone is. It also has a calendar to plan crops, bundle tracker, and skill tracker. Has all the farm building info. Paid like $1.49 for it so it doesn't have ads. Loads way faster than the wiki.

Edit: It's called Stardew Guide and the logo is green with a white chicken."
Catswithjobs,ff9nqu6,t1_ff9j1gl,1579716839.0,I've had to leave places that are just too dusty because that's what I'm most allergic to. It's impossible to cater to everyone's needs like that. I wouldn't complain unless it's a restaurant or health facility.
news,ff9exmp,t1_ff95wpj,1579711553.0,"I'd have to know the full extent of it, but I would probably be more lenient. I would probably go with the lower end of what the law suggests for sentencing. I would rather him serve a small jail sentence then ordered to community service, parole. I'm a proponent of community service in lieu of jail time. I feel that would have more of a positive effect on rehabilitation than just prison. Of course, depends on the person and crime. I feel even 10 years for this is too much, but of course I don't know the full details and how high up the ladder in the operation he was."

I felt it was weird, slightly out of character, but it was a surprise left hook to my heart. >!I LOVE when bad people have emotional weaknesses. He was basically in love with his arch enemy.!< I thrive on that shit, whether it makes sense or not. It's my weakness lol."
television,ff95zcv,t1_ff7yv3p,1579705643.0,"I am so conflicted about this show as a huge fan of the novel. I liked some things, didn't understand other things.. I learned the term ""gay baiting"" from this show. However, the last line of the third episode resonated with me in such a weirdly poignant way that I give the whole series an ""okay"" verdict.. I LOVED the nun character. She was my favorite part about the series.

""Like many women of the age I am stuck in a loveless marriage and keeping on appearances for the sake of keeping a roof over my head."" She was hysterical."

harrypotter,ff8xyqi,t1_ff7vdqu,1579699682.0,"Exactly! Thank you! You're right, the mysterious build up around the character was sublime. We know exactly how we're supposed to feel about Snape until his death, then it makes us question.. I love when something flips my view of the character at the last minute.

It happened in the new Dracula on Netflix too. Left me floored."

He only got ""life"" because of the ""three strikes rule"" which is absolutely outdated and barbaric as well. I firmly believe non violent crimes should be weighed much differently than violent ones.


I feel so bad for this guy and his family. And the countless others affected by stupid Marijuana convictions. I think we'll see it federally legalized in at least the next two decades so hopefully that will put an end to it.. Better late than never. Still completely and utterly unfair."
wow,ff731eq,t1_ff6vglo,1579640118.0,"I haven't thoroughly enjoyed the game since WotLK.

You are entirely right about your point that everyone plays this game for a different reason, and I admit I've forgotten to include that, but the fact remains they have intentionally locked features of the game behind huge time sinks, to draw out the time it takes for people to achieve things. Like flying and races. Which I personally hate. But, you're absolutely right. some people like the months of grinding and the repetitive daily/weekly things required to progress, which is my least favorite aspect of the game. 

One of my favorite parts of Wow was the social aspect. I loved my guildies. We were together from BC to WoD before it disbanded in WoD when people started leaving. I've since been in another huge guild for 2 years and after Legion it dropped to a handful of people. It just makes me sad. I have so many wonderful memories of the game and perhaps I've just outgrown it and it's time to move on. But that's hard to do after 10+ years invested in a single game."
wow,ff72afa,t1_ff6y7bx,1579639689.0,"I don't think that's comparable at all. They aren't concerned about server resources in the least, they need to KEEP subscribers more than anything. All they are doing is lengthening the stick of the metaphorical ""carrot on the stick"" instead of making the carrot more appealing. The hard core players rush through everything then autopilot or unsub until there's more content. If it takes forever for a casual player to complete something, they also drive people away. The game just isn't as fun anymore. It's a full time job if you want to stay current and may Elune have mercy on your soul if you even think about alts."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ff6o4fd,t1_ff69kc8,1579631340.0,"The main reason women have been subjugated by men since the beginning of time is because they are physically stronger than us. That's it. Try to resist a man 5000 years ago, 1000, 100, or even today? Beat her up, she won't resist again. If both sexes were physically equal from the beginning the world would probably be entirely different. 

It is 2020 and finally men aren't ""allowed"" to control us with violence.
Now we are standing up for ourselves, telling people we're not putting up with sexual harassment/assault anymore, and we want to be in charge of our own bodies? Of course they are afraid, their reign at the top is at an end. We know we are equal to men and now we can shout it out and strive for change. Now they have to control us through laws in an attempt to hold even a shred of power over us. So pathetic."
wow,ff6msp0,t1_ff6bnja,1579630538.0,"I think at this point it's fair to say every decision Blizzard makes is only to increase play time. That makes their ""stats"" look better.

""Look, play time is up! People are playing the game more! That means they like it!""

Play time does not equate to enjoyment. They are just stretching everything out as long as possible because they can't figure out how to make the game fun anymore."

He's an awful person, but he's an awesome CHARACTER precisely because he causes so many different opinions and strong feelings. Same reason I love Umbridge, as a CHARACTER. 

People think they have such profound thoughts when they point out he's a bad person. But he's not a person, he's a fictitious character who did not make his own choices. If people could separate realism from fiction, we could move past such shallow and childish topics and I feel discussions would be more interesting."

AskReddit,ff2zptz,t1_ff2xyv5,1579529729.0,"I'm so sorry, but that's not a good sign and it needs to be addressed immediately. That could be indicative of an even deeper mental issue.

A lot of the men on my dad's side of the family died well before 40 from drinking to cope with mental illness, including him.

science,fdgmfnc,t1_fdgcpsm,1578402217.0,"Depression can be a biological deficiency in the brain. Meaning no matter where you are in life or how happy you are, you still feel helpless and sick. It is your brain chemistry. So the presence or absence of people would not affect it. My depression is biological which means it's uncurable.

Depression from social issues like yours can most likely be corrected by cognitive behavioral therapy. Just changing the way you think. So considering ""thinking"" got you into your social depression, ""thinking"" can get you out.
