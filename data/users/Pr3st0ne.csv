todayilearned,fg0w1ud,t1_ffxn96p,1580416143.0,"I talked about it in another comment but I totally agree with you. I did some quick maths and the difference in income over a lifetime is absolutely insane. Here's a basic comparison:

>Say you drop out and you spend the rest of your life at an average of 15$/hr, that's 31.2k per year. Say you work for 50 years because you worked from around 15 to 65. That's a lifetime salary of 1.56 million dollars.  
>  
>If you go to college and earn an administrative degree and start properly working at 21 instead, but now you earn 24$ an hour as a project manager(50k/year), until you're 65, that's a lifetime salary of 2.2 million dollars.  
>  
>Construction work and other trades like plumbing also pay great money and you don't need to be ""book smart"" for those.

I also did the math for something like a lawyer making 200k a year starting at 30 years old and the lifetime salary was like 7 million dollars."
apexlegends,fg0qe4u,t3_ewa8ao,1580412980.0,Soooo does he see himself as human and the glass in his neck broke the illusion and he just realized he's a machine or what? Not sure what to make of it.
MurderedByWords,fg0mpdd,t1_fg0kocj,1580410885.0,"I'm not talking about clickbaitey bullshit nitpicked extrapolation from studies  like ""People who drink IPAs are more likely to be psychopaths"" that you see on your Facebook feed. I'm talking about real, peer-reviewed studies.

Are you seriously implying that the entire field of psychology is flawed and we shouldn't trust peer-reviewed studies coming out of that field?"
MurderedByWords,fg0jt6o,t1_fg0boie,1580409231.0,"Let's say I messed up and we can't show causation. What I'm saying is still valid.

The results found in these psychological studies may not be able to determine with 100% certainty how a person will act in XYZ situation, but they give us some pretty damn reliable pointers, and it's still valid science. Isolation and lack of self-care are possible symptoms of depression. Living alone is also seen as a risk factor for a bunch of conditions, notably heart disease and depression. 

Besides, are you not going to answer my question about the rest of your life regime?"
MurderedByWords,fg0fmb6,t1_fg0cw9w,1580406787.0,"That's an odd but pretty cool program!

Perfect if you want to change things up in your decor without actually having to buy new stuff. Your house would feel like an art gallery."
MurderedByWords,fg0bs3w,t1_fg0b46e,1580404472.0,"I agree. ""Curing"" depression is a mix of many things, but putting yourself in a good headspace helps when your house is not super depressing to begin with."
MurderedByWords,fg0ba36,t1_fg0955b,1580404174.0,"Psychology is not ""incapable of showing causation"". There is some woo in there like any other science, but you shouldn't question the results of peer-reviewed studies. The studies aren't saying that ""people with a room like this are future serial killers"", but they might demonstrate that lack of hygiene, little or no interest in self-care and lack of social life are possible signs of depression.

As for the furniture you need, I'm not saying you NEED anything else, but I'm curious as to what your life regime looks like. Do you have kitchen utensils and tools to make yourself decent meals? Do you do exercise? You very well might be the odd man out, but the majority of people with your lifestyle typically don't take care of themselves very well and obviously that's going to have long term impacts on your body and on your mental health. Let's get real, a ton of people with houses full of crap also eat like crap and don't exercise. That's not the point I'm making. I'm just making an observation that people who live in a place like pictured above don't USUALLY have a super healthy lifestyle and changing up their living spaces is a good way to begin living a healthier life."
MurderedByWords,fg0a9av,t1_fg08uv3,1580403556.0,We don't know if this specific photo is an example of that. Doesn't make what I said any less true.
MurderedByWords,fg08do7,t1_fg06oas,1580402424.0,"I get what you're saying, but I think there's a pretty broad spectrum between being ""materialistic"" and just having basic furniture and giving yourself a healthy space to live in.

I'm not saying you're a freak or you're 100% depressed, it's fine if you're happy that way, but people who live like this have a heightened chance of being depressed or becoming depressed. There is definitely science in the fact that a healthy living space promotes healthy living."
MurderedByWords,fg062g6,t1_fg05uhx,1580401014.0,"I can appreciate a student living like that, but even then you can get some free coffee tables or bookcases or tables on Craigslist.

A divorced 35 year old living like this makes me worried about their mental health and I would think there's a fair chance this person is depressed. If you're not depressed yet you're bound to become depressed by living in a place like that."
MurderedByWords,fg05vl8,t1_fg03u8t,1580400896.0,"I can appreciate that, but there's a bare minimum of furniture you need if you want to have a somewhat functionnal home, whether you want to see people or not. A coffee table to put your glass or a book? A bookcase for your books? Photo frames for pictures of people you love or art you like? I'd bet he doesn't have any kitchen tools or pans to make himself decent food. It's not really about whether someone can live in such a room, of course you can, but it gives us strong hints as to what type of person this is, and this is not the room of someone who is putting their best foot forward and trying to keep themselves happy."
trashy,fg01siw,t1_fg00im4,1580398312.0,"I understand the kid doesn't necessarily want to hold a grudge against his mom, and that's fine, but there's a difference between not holding a grudge and literally accepting to live in a terrible environment woth no hot water or heat or food when a perfectly fine environment is also available to you for free. It sounds like the kid would have a grudge against his dad if he's willing to refuse a 400$ allowance and would rather live with no hot water or heat than go live with him."
MurderedByWords,ffzxf40,t3_ew52hz,1580395363.0,"I'm a dude and there's nothing wrong with living a frugal or simple lifestyle and not needing much to be happy... But this crosses into the territory of ""This appartment will make you depressed because it's so bare, and you can't entertain a normal social life because nobody will ever come over to your place... Nor should they because they have nowhere to sit and you probably nothing but beer and instant noodles to eat."""
