depression,fek78c7,t3_epikcs,1579194057.0,"I'm not a random online hugger, but god damn if that doesn't deserve one I don't know what does ! Hug is offered if wanted. 

Sounds like we're still stuck in medieval times when it comes to mental health. (- the torture, thankfully, just the loss of freedom)"

SuicideWatch,fei80c9,t3_ep9alz,1579132329.0,I'm so sorry 😞
aww,fei6niu,t3_ep8ngb,1579131463.0,Such a dame!
depression,fehs477,t3_ep7s2d,1579122777.0,Sounds like something that actually could benefit from therapy. :)
antiwork,fehqpb7,t3_ep7un8,1579121971.0,I would've said scratching your butthole after it's been itching in public xD but sure that too
antiwork,feh98bb,t3_eoyuis,1579111775.0,"Well actually yes and no. They maybe don't NEED it, but they certainly should be able to if they so wanted. It's like vocational training in some European countries. People don't NEED a 3-5 year degree. If a very complicated subject and I do see the post's point, but there's various factors to consider. 
In any case, I don't like Klobuchar anyway x) and the bottom line is everyone should have access to higher education, what you do with it is up to you."

Impressive!"
amiugly,fec4vip,t1_fec4dov,1578966685.0,"Lmao ok for starters, ""bonus points"" for assuming shit - not a cheater. 
You wait for ""us"" to arrive? Do you have nothing else to do? 
Believe me watching you people judge someone with self esteem issues in today's society does not fucking make life easy.

Edit: autocorrect first to does. Changed it."
depression,fec4gn0,t3_eo1usb,1578966513.0,I totally feel you. Really happy for you being able to get a part time job though. Hope it's enough for you financially
amiugly,fec3ldg,t3_eo3tq6,1578966151.0,Pretty!
amiugly,fec3h9i,t3_eo8ugc,1578966103.0,1st and 6th pics are my fave :) I think you look kind of Celtic in those. And I like your jawline too.
amiugly,fec2lim,t3_eobawe,1578965749.0,"I'm a hetero girl so not gonna vote beyond ""definitely not ugly"" just wanted to intervene and say to forget about the wankers. I can't believe that's the shit they jump to. So sorry you got those replies, I definitely understand what you mean by your post and find it completely normal.
Edited to add: they're probably just incels."
amiugly,fec1j68,t3_eb6lh9,1578965292.0,Cute!
depression,fec12od,t3_eo71t2,1578965087.0,"New experiences.. love and shit.

blop,febyi1x,t1_fe9q8fc,1578964313.0,Specist. Just cause both their last names are dog? Pff.
aww,febxy28,t3_eo9y6y,1578964082.0,"They look like they've been chasing each other right up until they were snatched up by their moms for making such a ruckus 😊 ""this'll calm them down"" cuties."
SuicideWatch,fe5u958,t3_enq8y6,1578875071.0,"I'm sorry to say that it doesn't sound like you're very high on the eq scale as eq also includes social communication and relatability. 

That being said, I completely agree with you otherwise."
tippytaps,fdzcpra,t1_fdq83pd,1578789000.0,"Same here but miniature Schnauzer getting scritches on mid-lower back. He doesn't lick the air, just stupidly looks around and then lifts his head like good is directly speaking to him 😂 until he can't see any ""higher back"" 😂"
tippytaps,fdzc9o2,t3_en1jf4,1578788775.0,This is awesome 😍
tippytaps,fdzc25y,t3_en8tnn,1578788650.0,Aaaaaahhhhh! Our baby does this too! He's a mini Schnauzer and he often dances when he gets his lower back scratched. Loves Dem scritches!
SuicideWatch,fdv3w52,t1_fdum1yf,1578742853.0,"Don't worry, I don't find it patronising. Your message is well received. 
Unfortunately a huge lack of motivation Congress with this bullshit so it's hard to do shit. And I don't have any friends."
SuicideWatch,fdt2n17,t1_fdszovd,1578711119.0,"Well excuse the assumption but it makes no sense how you could call them a coward. You may not think it's the way to go, but you do not call them cowards. Good for you if you stuck it out, not everyone can."
SuicideWatch,fdsz4w5,t1_fdsyup9,1578709833.0,Never call a suicider a coward. Shows how much you know. It's not cowardly to want to end the pain.
SuicideWatch,fdsxs07,t1_fdsq8b3,1578709333.0,"Hope useless it is. All the effort it demands. All of it for nothing. The way everything sucks, like wars, and pain, and idiots. How it's always a disappointment."

SuicideWatch,fdslqde,t1_fdslbol,1578704826.0,He knows. He's supportive. But that doesn't stop me from being sad and annoying. :/
SuicideWatch,fdsirof,t1_fdpybhy,1578703539.0,Not always easy to move to another country bro. And this said by someone who moved to another continent.
