onewheel,ffnzf4v,t3_eu9y0i,1580072615.0,As someone with almost 20 years of various board riding experience it still feels awkward even though I can ride switch way better than my wife who snowboards occasionally with a regular stance (Iím goofy). Itís a good skill to have especially on the OW which can ride in either direction with ease. Iíve dodged tons of cars cutting turns too close by just riding switch backwards. Once you get decent you donít even need to turn around and you can literally switch between stances which allows you to be more nimble in a tight space.

onewheel,ffjpdlk,t3_etsiva,1580003609.0,Iím greatly enjoying the Pint I picked over a plus. Was able to get a good deal on a low mileage one plus it just [looks](https://i.imgur.com/ZXlRXyl.jpg) great! Top speed hasnít been an issue since Iím just cruising
onewheel,ffi9i33,t1_ffi7e42,1579968530.0,Yea I know. My car is wrapped in satin black film but this looked almost gloss in person. As itís drying out itís lookin better though.
boostedboards,ffi0dp0,t1_ffhxdj2,1579961209.0,Yea Iím on the bottom side of Brooklyn and itís usually in the city and Iím lazy. I have seen a few smaller groups riding through here though but hey Iím not a very social person I guess lol
boostedboards,ffi0b2f,t1_ffhzena,1579961139.0,"Yea thatís what I did. On the v2 it was fine on the bumper but after standing on the tail the adhesive wore off. Thatís why I ordered the pronged flat lands so it could stand on its tail while the front looks clean. 

And of course"
boostedboards,ffhwj01,t3_etqgu5,1579957069.0,"Do you like free stuff? Well boy do I have a deal for you. Iíve have 2 sets of bumpers to give away. All you need to do is follow me on YouTube and Insta... wait no... I donít have any of that shit. Okay all you need to do is comment below and on Sunday 1/26/2020 at midnight (est) Iíll pull 2 winners. The first winner will get these fine Skate Kastle Aluminum Bash Guards valued at a whooping $59.99. The second winner will get this cool Tail Guard/Pronged Flatland bash guard combo.  All you need to do is send me your address when you win and Iíll ship them for free. 

[Check our this Beautiful Stealth with Aluminum Bash Guards](https://i.imgur.com/vUOgs4m.jpg)

Also while not a paid advert, the owner of Skate Kastle is pretty cool. When I got my Boosted  Stealth there was a tracking error or something if I remember correctly so I ordered a second set and he even called me to let me know he had brought it to be shipped so itíll be there since I had a flight soon. So yea thatís what I call good customer service so if youíre in the market for premium bash guards head to Skate Kastle. I told him Iíd give away my second pair but I thought Iíd go on a NYC group ride but remembered Iím a loser and I ride alone. Also Flatland is great I had them on my v2 so if youíre on a budget go there. 

Also you gotta be in the US imma ship this USPS Priority"
onewheel,ffh8y01,t3_etlkti,1579926526.0,"Where in Brooklyn are you riding in? I bought a used one off a dude from Rockaway with 18 miles and finally got some riding in today around Sheepshead lol

For
1: I agree itís kinda wonky with the pressure detection and at low speeds it just cuts off. Iím size 11 but I think a slightly stiffer sole cuts back on some of the problems. On my NMDs or slippers itís iffy unless Iím looking to make sure itís detecting. In slightly stiffer sneakers itís been fine with detecting like my wife and her converse.

2: Most likely practice since Iíve had no problems stopping or heel lifting to get off

3: I havenít tried to go up many ramps but I was surprised it goes up and down smoothly and balances itself while on inclines lol

4: fuck yea but Iím also used to carrying 20lbs longboards so the handle is great

5: I got a good deal on a used so didnít really buy a fender but I did [paint mine](https://i.imgur.com/nhH7Gbc.jpg) in an effort to match my car. Looks good and itís easy. Cans of paint are like $5 but yea I feel you if you spent the money on the fender

6: I got no comments since Iíve only ridden in redwood and pacific so far

7: all boards are dangerous imo but this is probably the safest for me since Iím going slower on it vs 30mph on my eboards

Anyway if you see a blacked out Pint coming out of a blacked out car it might be me since Iíll be all over Brooklyn cruising while I drive my wife around on her nursing visits lol"
dji,ffh65r9,t3_et6963,1579924192.0,Ignoring the legality of the filming... thatís a nice looking car lol. Or maybe itís the footage.... and 36k ntb do I need another car?...
boostedboards,ffh2zxi,t3_etbw2u,1579921723.0,If you get skate kastles aluminum guards it turns your board into a lethal weapon. I actually have a spare set somewhere maybe that I meant to give away on the sub lol.
airsoft,ffh2rnx,t3_et981h,1579921550.0,"And I got a used tooth pick and and q-tip in the box when I got a a fuckin steal of a price off some site I never heard of when I ordered a TM KSG like a week after it was announced for a solid like $160. Iím not even mad, I mostly felt bad they honored the order and crazy ass promo code since I didnít see any others being sold in the US and it was out of stock/preorder everywhere else for like $500."
onewheel,ffgymd4,t3_etj8ts,1579918420.0,"Iíve busted my ass pretty bad on every other board but electric ones. Thereís a time and place for speed and when Iím flooring it, itís only when I have a long clear stretch and Iím ready to fall. Busting your ass is part of riding any board and itís discouraging but it happens. With electric Iíd definitely just take it slow after a fall. The OW is most definitely for cruising and not for speed. Iím finding just weaving around my house more fun than flying down the street at 30mph on my eboards lol"
onewheel,ffgf6rz,t3_etawbu,1579904874.0,I just finished 6 coats in [satin black](https://i.imgur.com/JsCYZTk.jpg) in an attempt to match my car. Itís looking a little shiny for satin though lol.
onewheel,ffgdfke,t3_etfc8m,1579903774.0,Iíve got a whooping [12mph](https://i.imgur.com/fZJ1FlB.png) on my Pint. To be fair Iíve only gotten to ride it half a mile outside so far lol.
onewheel,fff9q6s,t3_et96lg,1579879169.0,"Thatís those super natural instincts kicking in when a life is in danger right there lol

Edit: Words didnít come out right"
teslamotors,ffeatee,t3_esybrf,1579841551.0,[Stats](https://i.imgur.com/LqlO0WS.png) on iOS does exactly what your asking. Including notifying you that climate control is on and you may have forgotten. Also locks the car for you if you left it unlocked. All in all a very useful app.
onewheel,ffcmrmf,t3_essx0h,1579802764.0,"I went with the Pint as a kinda try it before I buy it and commit like 2k+ after decking it out as I do with all the cool toys I buy. OW+ weíre around the same price as a Pint. Some of the differences that influenced my decision were; 

Base range (I believe the pint beats it by an advertised ~2 miles), 

Weather sealing (Pint apparently has better stock sealing for electronics from what Iíve read)

Polish (Pint just looks better, of course you can change up the looks but that cost money)

While you can upgrade the range on the plus, itíll cost money and itís not cheap. At that point you might as well just spend a bit more for a used XR if you can find one. 

But yea I got the Pint with the intention of upgrading to an XR so take what you will from this. In my local market Iíve seen used Plus for around $800-900 which is comparable to a Pint. 2100 seems like a lot but basically everyone says theyíre built like tanks so I guess itís okay (really not bad for the price in my area). Top speed isnít a problem for me on the Pint since I just want to cruise. If I want to go fast I have other electric toys like a board or a car."
onewheel,ff8xnxi,t1_ff8unyq,1579699428.0,Ay I gotta go down to Knoxville go hunt down a tenant who hasnít been paying rent lol. Wonder how hard it would be to take my OW on the plane? Knoxville sounds like a good ride lol
onewheel,ff8x1he,t1_ff8oelf,1579698878.0,Yea I think I described it poorly. Stiffer I described was probably closer to a normal sole. I havenít ridden it in like dress shoe hard soles. Probably slightly stiffer than Adidas NMDís stiffer. Iíve only had the Pint for a few days and havenít really looked at the light bar since I was riding it after work and itís kind of blinding to me in darker light lol
onewheel,ff83ozn,t3_es6bfk,1579665152.0,Iím new to the OW but I think it might be because Iím not triggering both both halves of the sensors. Ok stiffer sole shoes I can balance fine but with slippers with a flexible sole it disconnects for me. Again not much experience so could be wrong
Documentaries,ff7u67u,t1_ff7tgag,1579658446.0,You know after looking through their profile... I think they donít realize that theyíre defining cringe lol
teslamotors,ff7m597,t3_erfyjh,1579652845.0,Jesus a Model X and a GTR... I mean the car splitting in half is wild but damn thatís an expensive crash
Documentaries,ff7llhr,t1_ff7eimc,1579652464.0,I think the whole point of the documentary was to explain that heís just living his life doing what he wants... If someone being happy living life how they want is cringe then boy you probably wonít end up like him lol.
ValveIndex,ff73oxl,t1_ff6z6hq,1579640492.0,Yup I bought beat saber as a joke but me and my wife have like 6+ hour goes at the game lol
ValveIndex,ff6vyjw,t3_erqc92,1579636003.0,"I got the Rift S and the Index at the same time and visually didnít see much of a difference. I liked the Oculus see through cam more so I could avoid my wifeís dogs. Index has better sound, controllers, and comfort for longer sessions. If moneyís an issue the Rift would have been fine. I kept the index 90% because the headset was more comfortable though lol."
TeslaModel3,ff6vlw9,t3_erq0a3,1579635794.0,Iím committed to backing in because there wasnít a rear sentry cam before.
TeslaModel3,ff6v2au,t3_eryxwl,1579635478.0,Iirc mine was $750 for side windows and the back in two pieces. It was $100 extra for one piece in the back. Just easier to install two smaller pieces. The only time I can see the line where the two pieces over lap is if my face is 2 inches from the interior of the window lol.
onewheel,ff6qqhp,t1_ff6qddm,1579632903.0,"Yea they probably just become background noise to them though lol. Me and my friend used to race and we pushed around 20+mph on fixed gears and heís had someone taking a picture back up into him. Dude went flying and got mad at us... I mean itís not even like he got hit, he just walked into a speeding bike and spun away like a tornado lol"
onewheel,ff6q6o0,t1_ff6jldx,1579632578.0,"As a former biker, yes.. lol. I mean thereís clear marking itís a bike path so why would you gather a dozen people to take a selfie there?!?"
boostedboards,ff6grcu,t1_ff6bnn6,1579626853.0,Iíve got them on my Stealth as well! Doesnít it make your board feel like a weapon? Pretty sure I cracked a tile putting my board down lol
boostedboards,ff6glla,t1_ff6ewq8,1579626755.0,"I wouldnít compare a car to a Boosted board lol. Wasnít their slogan something like ìThe last mile vehicleî? As much as I love my boards theyíre honesty all toys to me. I can see people making short commutes on them but Iíve gotta assume most people just use them for fun...

So yea alot of money for some cool toys yes..."
gaming,ff6fvjv,t1_ff65cn2,1579626305.0,"Iím not saying youíre wrong but no one should have a $5 shitty mic. My best friend has some busted ass cheap mic and it sounds like heís deepthroating it while heís trapped in a wind tunnel. Gotta mute him itís so bad lol. But yea heís probably like this guy, waste tons on partying then complains he has no money to buy a cheap mic smh"
ElectricSkateboarding,ff664yu,t3_erfjih,1579620055.0,My brother in law was asking me about this since he snowboards and I got a few eboards. I didnít see many reviews so I suggested a OW or something. After seeing this Iím mildly tempted to tell him to just buy it so I can try it and compare it to the OW I picked up the other day after looking for a snowboard alternative for him. Kinda doubt it would be a fun ride for him though. I think that lunatic wanted to ride from Mill Basin to the Freedom Towers lmao. Donít think the range is there and Iíve done it on a Boosted Stealth and I canít say it was super enjoyable due to the shitty streets.
onewheel,ff651rj,t3_ervgoa,1579619305.0,Iíd say just get one if you can. I see nothing wrong with the current line up. If anything Iíd assume they drop a more polished XR similar to the Pint. I was 50/50 on which to get and was thinking maybe Iíll get whatever new one they drop in the future and a Pint now. My wife has only snowboarded (real easy green trails) or gone in straight lines on my eboards but she loves the Pint. Iíve been riding it in the house since the weathers bad and she keeps asking to ride it so at this point Iím just going to give it to her and grab an XR lol... but until then this Pint is mine and Iíll fight her.
FashionReps,ff5bkv5,t3_ereukg,1579586300.0,"Yea so I went to a private school with uniforms so I have no idea wtf other kids wore but as an adult if I saw someone decked out in designer clothes Iíd think most people wouldnít be thinking wow look at all that nice shit. Itíd be more like Jesus that clown has idea how to save money lol. Most of the stuff I buy is pretty low key and I never understood the box logo stuff that seems so popular. Me and my wife probably make more than the average person and we have mostly real pieces like CG coats or LV wallets and bags but reps are best when theyíre something I canít find retail due to season or theyíre just too expensive to justify. Maybe I like really like the Mastermind x Adidas NMDs so i splurge and get the real ones but Iím not buying every Yeezy color way or way just because I think they look cool and can afford them. That money is way better spent on a house or a car lol. Amazes me the amount of people I see wearing Gucci belts or some kinda crazy shoes and hopping into a beat ass 1990 corolla, like how do you waste money when you clearly have more important expenses?"
onewheel,ff4weyl,t3_erne0r,1579574063.0,Damn name looks familiar from the leaderboards but that XRs looking a little small? Maybe itís cold lol
onewheel,ff4w3fb,t3_ermxm2,1579573845.0,Ay just got a Pint the other day but it was snowing so I spent the day riding it in the kitchen while I was making a lasagna lol
onewheel,ff4o413,t3_erjw9p,1579568338.0,Wow Iíve only ridden a mile so far (indoors lol) but my wifeís gonna be mad when she sees me doing shit like this. Wonder how hard itíll be to balance while going sideways...
funny,ff4j39l,t1_ff3fzaq,1579564825.0,MIL came to America as part of a contract to work as a city nurse along with her friends. My wife is now a nurse and most of my MILs friends children are nurses now as well. Itís kinda funny... also makes me want to be a nurse... sounds like a great job if you can handle the stress
onewheel,ff26nft,t3_er7r32,1579495316.0,I just got one yesterday and left it in the cold ass basement last night. Pretty sure it said in the app I got a notification saying it was too cold when I turned it on. Just needed to warm up a bit and it was fine. Part of EVs really. Even my car doesnít run at peak when itís cold out so I need to precondition so the regen brakes work lol
TeslaLounge,ff1pf4x,t1_fezwfx1,1579483235.0,Lol when that song was popular everyone kept blasting it at me because of my ethnicity. I secretly loved it hahaha
teslamotors,ff1mjyb,t3_eqxi2p,1579481657.0,My MIL asked me about it yesterday. I just shrugged and said Iíve never had a problem or heard anyone else talk about it lol. Didnít even know it was a thing being spoken about on the media. I looked it up and an article said thousands complained but I just laughed because this sub wouldíve been the first place I saw those complaints.
onewheel,ff1m0qn,t3_er1fqv,1579481394.0,I got a Pint with the fender and extra bumper bundle yesterday from a guy selling it for $800. Had 18 miles and I feel like that was a pretty good price. Would payed $800 for it without the extras.

vaporents,ff01ccj,t1_fezv1sb,1579464088.0,Also try an adapter for a bubbler or bong or something. I havenít tried it but the adapters are cheap and I have a bubbler for my crafty too and I can tell a difference. Im at the point I have so much gear but honestly if I had an induction heater and some kind of adapter for the Dyna I would be satisfied with just that. Volcano is amazing but I probably spent a grand on it and at the end of the day it all does the same stuff lol
AskReddit,fezcply,t3_eqjrvi,1579455983.0,"Man I scrolled for a while but League of Legends. Still wildly popular but Iíve been playing since it came out almost and own a few hundred skins and all the characters. Iím absolute trash and never play anything but aram or the other limited time game types. 

Next to that is Enter the Gungeon. Every run is totally unique and Iím trash at that too."
AskReddit,fezc9o1,t1_fetlv90,1579455883.0,There was another fable that I alpha tested like 2 years ago that got canceled. Probably the earliest I ever got to play a game. Like there were just checkerboard characters and walls in a bunch of points it was so beta but boy did I feel some type of way when they said it was canceled
vaporents,fez8548,t3_eqy9de,1579454689.0,Yea definitely the heat since you canít control it as precisely as an electric. Putting it through water helps as well. Dyna for me is a little harsh after the second heat up. With my crafty it gets harsher around 380. On my Volcano I use an obsidian (bubbler) and I can pump it up to 400 no problem.
TeslaLounge,fez6xtg,t3_eqwv9r,1579454407.0,My front tires have been showing 38 for like 2 months when itís cold. Only the left is yellow if it dips below 30 degrees lol.

airsoft,feyzwi7,t3_eqvueo,1579452541.0,I have a few guns but 99% of the time I just run a glock like this (but itís a TM). At a certain point I just feel like using the mags to ìstabî people lol
ebikes,feysv4x,t3_eqwlrp,1579450198.0,Whatís the point of fatter tires if youíre not using them right? Itís always fun to ride in some tougher terrain once in a while lol.
dji,fewcb90,t1_fewb5r3,1579408289.0,Iím actually cool with real estate since I like architecture but Iíve tried doing some paid work for modeling  and even though they loved it I just felt like it was shit and couldíve done better. Maybe it was conflicting styles or something (not the biggest fan of glamours glowing ig style stuff). I was lucky enough to have a project in a gallery where some people bought some prints I could I was proud of but I took that as the beginning and end of my photography career lol... back to college I go so I can get an easy city job I guess haha

dji,few9oxz,t1_few8hx8,1579407240.0,Yea youíre probably not crazy if you feel a difference lol. I went from a Mavic Platnium to FPV and it really messed me up. When I got the Pro I was half expecting it to do flips through trees at 1000mph. Either way youíre definitely way more experienced than me since I just fly it for fun haha
dji,few89ns,t1_few7ui0,1579406797.0,Ah totally fair. Have you ever tried FPV because yea itís like everything you think you know goes out the window. Very satisfying once you get it down and you can get some crazy smooth action shots as well.
onewheel,few7v23,t1_few6uyp,1579406616.0,Lol thanks! Been snowing all day so all I got to do was smash into a wall in the basement so far... got a used bundle with a fender and rail guard and 18 miles for a good price though so Iím happy

Any reason youíd pick a v2 Phantom over the Mavic Pro? Is the video or camera quality that much better than the portability?"
dji,few6bj9,t1_fet9y59,1579405900.0,My Mavic Pro 2 fell through a tree from about 50ft. I had it wrapped so not a scratch on it but all the props exploded.

teslamotors,few2mgl,t1_few2508,1579404612.0,Oh yea itís been like half a year since that or the phone charging cables were included. I feel like there was something else minor that was removed at the same time as well but I canít remember lol
IAmA,few1ru8,t3_eqmcjh,1579404267.0,"Whatís youíre general opinion on electric cars? Would you like to see Mercedes convert their whole line to electric or do you think they need to keep some ICE? I personally like riding bikes and skateboards but needed to drive so my wife got me a Tesla basically. She previously (still owns) a big ass GL350 or something? 

The interior materials are definitely better but she definitely likes the Tesla more between the updates, acceleration, and general technology that it has over the Benz (AP, Netflix, huge live traffic map). While she says she wants another Tesla I feel like if there were more high end luxury options from other manufacturers sheíd be swayed because of the name. I also feel like the odds of another manufacturer throwing out biweekly updates to performance is unlikely though so what do you think the odds of that happening are?"

ebikes,fessoww,t1_fesogjc,1579368618.0,In nyc you have the right to ride down the middle of its too tight. Iíve never said a word to any cyclist as long as theyíre not dicking around and aware theyíre not the only one on the road (kids popping wheelies and shit and just blocking the street are another thing). I will give a polite little honk if someoneís in a car going 5mph down a street though lol
ebikes,fesrzaw,t1_fesqtmz,1579368402.0,Yea my daily commute is in NYC down a nice long street with a bike path that has tons of room. Itís well lit but occasionally someone will fly down the road (not the bike path) on an ebike or scooter. Spooks the shit out of me because of course I donít want to hit someone with two tons of car. Iíve got lights on my bikes and my eboards so I know they work but Jesus fuck some people are cruising with no concern for anyone else.  At a minimum a light would be cool so I know theyíre there. Iíve got absolutely no problems going down a street at 5mph if itís too tight to pass.

My father and mother also have had it done (whole family went to the same place) and they have no issues at all. 

If you feel like your vision is bad enough to get it itís probably worth it. On a side note I used to wonder (not realistic at all) what would happen if I were trapped on an island or lost in the woods and broke my glasses. Youíll never have to worry about that again!"

UberEATS,fefagqt,t1_fef58vi,1579051990.0,"Pretty sure itís not everyone but for me lights just look extremely bright. The best example I can give is with a cameras aperture based off this [image]( https://i.imgur.com/ssLITX4.jpg). If normal is 2.8 than Iím constantly at 22. Anything from street lights to tail lights are blinding so I canít really look near them at all. If an emergency service vehicle is behind or in front of me Iíd probably need to pull over until theyíre out of sight lol. This is all with 35% tints on my side windows and auto dimming/tinting rear view mirrors. 

It was an immediate thing for me. Iíve heard other people have that problem but for some it fades. My sister got it done and she has trouble with lights at night but not as bad as me. I honestly just donít drive at night or if I do I avoid the highway. Iím in the city though and thereís tons of lights. If Iím out in the middle of no where itís cool and Iím fine. Just bright lights in general can blind me even during the day. But sunglasses fix that. 

But yea I got it to pass the NYPDs vision requirements and I mustíve been blind as hell because totally worth it in my opinion. I had some sniper vision when I got tested as in better than 20/20. I think my optometrist said it was better than 20/15. If you really have bad vision Iíd get it because thereís nothing like waking up in the morning and seeing shit clearly."
teslamotors,feebcd7,t3_eo7zkj,1579030251.0,"I wrapped mine myself with 3M and Avery. It was the cheapest option and I have tons of time to kill. Total for the material was ~$600 with tons left over... like at least half rewrap the car after I redid the entire back. All I used were razors and a heat gun which cost like $20 (I used tape on the trim though). Then I put a matte ceramic fit on it which was ~$100.

It came out pretty [good](https://i.imgur.com/xB0jA5W.jpg) for someone with 0 car wrapping experience. But yea idk if everyone can do this. It requires time and patience and my wife had neither in her attempts to ìhelpî lol"
teslamotors,feea80c,t1_fee922s,1579029595.0,Yea I mostly just left it half closed where the door is cracked and that stopped it from reconnecting unless the door was opened again.

teslamotors,feea1q2,t3_eohmhi,1579029493.0,"Iíd say the biggest part of FSD right now is NoAP. Summon is kind of just a party trick that Iíve never actually used. If I didnít live in NYC or a major city Iíd say maybe. Like if I had a long commute with emptyish highways it would be great. 

As of right now NoAP which is FSD just canít handle the high traffic and short exit ramps at times here. Tight traffic means itíll never auto lane change because you basically need to cut people off to lane change here. If you do get an opening Iíve had it begin the lane change and jerk back when another car is near. On an empty highway some of the exits are really short and it might miss it if Iím moving ~55mph. 

That said Iíve seen major improvements since I g out the car with NoAP since the spring. I really do want FSD to work reliably but I just canít trust it as it is now. On longer trips out of the city I absolutely love it though. It even handles some of the higher speed winding roads upstate pretty well. But yea if I only drove in the city itíd be next to useless. I personally could have gone without it and been satisfied with the standard AP

Mildly curious if other people here in NYC have FSD because everyone else Iíve spoken to with a Tesla in person has said no."

ElectricSkateboarding,fee05dg,t1_fedyz3j,1579023566.0,Itís pretty easy. I posted [mine](https://reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/ed26aq/deck_swapped_meepo_mini_2_er_with_121c_aileron/) where I swapped to a carbon fiber kick tail deck. Hardest part is probably removing the cable that connects the battery to the esc which is kinda glued in. I personally used a heat gun which you can get for around $15 off amazon and removed the stuff with a screw driver then I just pulled it out. No risk of damaging anything really. All in all it turned out pretty good but the carbon fiber decks tail flex is spooking me.

onewheel,ffcmrmf,t3_essx0h,1579802764.0,"I went with the Pint as a kinda try it before I buy it and commit like 2k+ after decking it out as I do with all the cool toys I buy. OW+ we‚Äôre around the same price as a Pint. Some of the differences that influenced my decision were; 

Base range (I believe the pint beats it by an advertised ~2 miles), 

Weather sealing (Pint apparently has better stock sealing for electronics from what I‚Äôve read)

Polish (Pint just looks better, of course you can change up the looks but that cost money)

While you can upgrade the range on the plus, it‚Äôll cost money and it‚Äôs not cheap. At that point you might as well just spend a bit more for a used XR if you can find one. 

But yea I got the Pint with the intention of upgrading to an XR so take what you will from this. In my local market I‚Äôve seen used Plus for around $800-900 which is comparable to a Pint. 2100 seems like a lot but basically everyone says they‚Äôre built like tanks so I guess it‚Äôs okay (really not bad for the price in my area). Top speed isn‚Äôt a problem for me on the Pint since I just want to cruise. If I want to go fast I have other electric toys like a board or a car."

onewheel,ff651rj,t3_ervgoa,1579619305.0,I‚Äôd say just get one if you can. I see nothing wrong with the current line up. If anything I‚Äôd assume they drop a more polished XR similar to the Pint. I was 50/50 on which to get and was thinking maybe I‚Äôll get whatever new one they drop in the future and a Pint now. My wife has only snowboarded (real easy green trails) or gone in straight lines on my eboards but she loves the Pint.

Me and my wife probably make more than the average person and we have mostly real pieces like CG coats or LV wallets and bags but reps are best when they‚Äôre something I can‚Äôt find retail due to season or they‚Äôre just too expensive to justify. Maybe I like really like the Mastermind x Adidas NMDs so i splurge and get the real ones but I‚Äôm not buying every Yeezy color way or way just because I think they look cool and can afford them.

Any reason you‚Äôd pick a v2 Phantom over the Mavic Pro? Is the video or camera quality that much better than the portability?"
dji,few6bj9,t1_fet9y59,1579405900.0,My Mavic Pro 2 fell through a tree from about 50ft. I had it wrapped so not a scratch on it but all the props exploded. I‚Äôm amazed it was totally fine beyond the props. I‚Äôd kinda expect Phantoms to be able to endure more abuse since the wings are fixed but at least you got your money‚Äôs worth out of it.

teslamotors,few2mgl,t1_few2508,1579404612.0,Oh yea it‚Äôs been like half a year since that or the phone charging cables were included. I feel like there was something else minor that was removed at the same time as well but I can‚Äôt remember lol
IAmA,few1ru8,t3_eqmcjh,1579404267.0,"What‚Äôs you‚Äôre general opinion on electric cars? Would you like to see Mercedes convert their whole line to electric or do you think they need to keep some ICE? I personally like riding bikes and skateboards but needed to drive so my wife got me a Tesla basically. She previously (still owns) a big ass GL350 or something? 

The interior materials are definitely better but she definitely likes the Tesla more between the updates, acceleration, and general technology that it has over the Benz (AP, Netflix, huge live traffic map). While she says she wants another Tesla I feel like if there were more high end luxury options from other manufacturers she‚Äôd be swayed because of the name. I also feel like the odds of another manufacturer throwing out biweekly updates to performance is unlikely though so what do you think the odds of that happening are?"
teslamotors,few0ijv,t3_eqpuow,1579403732.0,Both me and my wife were registered on our car.

ebikes,fessoww,t1_fesogjc,1579368618.0,In nyc you have the right to ride down the middle of its too tight. I‚Äôve never said a word to any cyclist as long as they‚Äôre not dicking around and aware they‚Äôre not the only one on the road (kids popping wheelies and shit and just blocking the street are another thing). I will give a polite little honk if someone‚Äôs in a car going 5mph down a street though lol
ebikes,fesrzaw,t1_fesqtmz,1579368402.0,Yea my daily commute is in NYC down a nice long street with a bike path that has tons of room. It‚Äôs well lit but occasionally someone will fly down the road (not the bike path) on an ebike or scooter. Spooks the shit out of me because of course I don‚Äôt want to hit someone with two tons of car. I‚Äôve got lights on my bikes and my eboards so I know they work but Jesus fuck some people are cruising with no concern for anyone else.  At a minimum a light would be cool so I know they‚Äôre there. I‚Äôve got absolutely no problems going down a street at 5mph if it‚Äôs too tight to pass.
UberEATS,fesiirx,t1_fepqom0,1579365554.0,I only rode during the dinner rush and yea I averaged around the same and rarely got tips. I assumed people who complained were in more rural areas. Most the money if it was from quest or whatever they were called.

I actually decided not to join when they gave me my academy date even though it was my dream job as a kid but I‚Äôd like to think I got some nice eye sight out of the journey lol.

But I‚Äôd definitely research and talk to an optometrist if you can to see if you‚Äôre a good candidate for lasik and they should have way more info than I have on the subject lol"
UberEATS,fefhpyx,t1_fefgqlw,1579056561.0,"Yea I‚Äôm not sure exactly what causes it but I went to a pretty good (and crazy expensive) place. Honestly the procedure itself was no problem I took a train home by myself when I was done. Minor eye irritation for like a day or two after the surgery but besides that I just popped the eye drops and had no issues. My father and mother also have had it done (whole family went to the same place) and they have no issues at all. 

If you feel like your vision is bad enough to get it it‚Äôs probably worth it. On a side note I used to wonder (not realistic at all) what would happen if I were trapped on an island or lost in the woods and broke my glasses. You‚Äôll never have to worry about that again!"

UberEATS,fefagqt,t1_fef58vi,1579051990.0,"Pretty sure it‚Äôs not everyone but for me lights just look extremely bright. The best example I can give is with a cameras aperture based off this [image]( https://i.imgur.com/ssLITX4.jpg). If normal is 2.8 than I‚Äôm constantly at 22. Anything from street lights to tail lights are blinding so I can‚Äôt really look near them at all. If an emergency service vehicle is behind or in front of me I‚Äôd probably need to pull over until they‚Äôre out of sight lol. This is all with 35% tints on my side windows and auto dimming/tinting rear view mirrors. 

It was an immediate thing for me. I‚Äôve heard other people have that problem but for some it fades. My sister got it done and she has trouble with lights at night but not as bad as me. I honestly just don‚Äôt drive at night or if I do I avoid the highway. I‚Äôm in the city though and there‚Äôs tons of lights. If I‚Äôm out in the middle of no where it‚Äôs cool and I‚Äôm fine. Just bright lights in general can blind me even during the day. But sunglasses fix that. 

But yea I got it to pass the NYPDs vision requirements and I must‚Äôve been blind as hell because totally worth it in my opinion. I had some sniper vision when I got tested as in better than 20/20. I think my optometrist said it was better than 20/15. If you really have bad vision I‚Äôd get it because there‚Äôs nothing like waking up in the morning and seeing shit clearly."
teslamotors,feebcd7,t3_eo7zkj,1579030251.0,"I wrapped mine myself with 3M and Avery. It was the cheapest option and I have tons of time to kill. Total for the material was ~$600 with tons left over... like at least half rewrap the car after I redid the entire back. All I used were razors and a heat gun which cost like $20 (I used tape on the trim though). Then I put a matte ceramic fit on it which was ~$100.

It came out pretty [good](https://i.imgur.com/xB0jA5W.jpg) for someone with 0 car wrapping experience. But yea idk if everyone can do this. It requires time and patience and my wife had neither in her attempts to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù lol"
teslamotors,feea80c,t1_fee922s,1579029595.0,Yea I mostly just left it half closed where the door is cracked and that stopped it from reconnecting unless the door was opened again.

teslamotors,feea1q2,t3_eohmhi,1579029493.0,"I‚Äôd say the biggest part of FSD right now is NoAP. Summon is kind of just a party trick that I‚Äôve never actually used. If I didn‚Äôt live in NYC or a major city I‚Äôd say maybe. Like if I had a long commute with emptyish highways it would be great. 

As of right now NoAP which is FSD just can‚Äôt handle the high traffic and short exit ramps at times here. Tight traffic means it‚Äôll never auto lane change because you basically need to cut people off to lane change here. If you do get an opening I‚Äôve had it begin the lane change and jerk back when another car is near. On an empty highway some of the exits are really short and it might miss it if I‚Äôm moving ~55mph. 

That said I‚Äôve seen major improvements since I g out the car with NoAP since the spring. I really do want FSD to work reliably but I just can‚Äôt trust it as it is now. On longer trips out of the city I absolutely love it though. It even handles some of the higher speed winding roads upstate pretty well. But yea if I only drove in the city it‚Äôd be next to useless. I personally could have gone without it and been satisfied with the standard AP

Mildly curious if other people here in NYC have FSD because everyone else I‚Äôve spoken to with a Tesla in person has said no."

ElectricSkateboarding,fee05dg,t1_fedyz3j,1579023566.0,It‚Äôs pretty easy. I posted [mine](https://reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/ed26aq/deck_swapped_meepo_mini_2_er_with_121c_aileron/) where I swapped to a carbon fiber kick tail deck. Hardest part is probably removing the cable that connects the battery to the esc which is kinda glued in. I personally used a heat gun which you can get for around $15 off amazon and removed the stuff with a screw driver then I just pulled it out. No risk of damaging anything really. All in all it turned out pretty good but the carbon fiber decks tail flex is spooking me.

We‚Äôve got a special kind of stupid driving over here along with the cars who park in the bike lane sadly. But yea besides that it‚Äôs a pretty scenic ride with no stopping which isn‚Äôt that easy here in NYC lol. Marine park/Gerritsen Beach definitely have some dirt trails if you want. Occasionally along the second half of my trail you‚Äôll catch people on atvs and dirt bikes. Totally not legal but probably the closest thing to trails in the city
onewheel,fecr6db,t3_eoeb0d,1578981553.0,"Entire edge of Brooklyn from the bottom of Sunset Park to Cesars bay is a bike path. From there I go along the belt parkway where it‚Äôs basically empty streets/sidewalks and down Neptune (bike path kinda iffy or you can keep along the water and ride the boardwalk). Once you hit the end of Neptune it hits another bike path which goes along the belt to Lidenwood maybe? Tons of parks to cruise in along the way too (Calvert, Marine, that new one by Gateway). That‚Äôs like pavement or trails if you want to ride through the park. Dunno how long it is in total as I usually rode a bike along that but towards manhattan into Harlem on the weekends. Lots of places to charge as well. A few Starbucks along the way and what not.

Something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/5Z8AD6S.jpg). The red would be dedicated paths no stopping no cars. The green is all bike paths on the road but you can detour of course. Once you hit the marine parkish area I know there are actual dirt trails out there.
