teslamotors,ffeatee,t3_esybrf,1579841551.0,[Stats](https://i.imgur.com/LqlO0WS.png) on iOS does exactly what your asking. Including notifying you that climate control is on and you may have forgotten. Also locks the car for you if you left it unlocked. All in all a very useful app.
onewheel,ffcmrmf,t3_essx0h,1579802764.0,"I went with the Pint as a kinda try it before I buy it and commit like 2k+ after decking it out as I do with all the cool toys I buy. OW+ we’re around the same price as a Pint. Some of the differences that influenced my decision were; 

Base range (I believe the pint beats it by an advertised ~2 miles), 

Weather sealing (Pint apparently has better stock sealing for electronics from what I’ve read)

Polish (Pint just looks better, of course you can change up the looks but that cost money)

While you can upgrade the range on the plus, it’ll cost money and it’s not cheap. At that point you might as well just spend a bit more for a used XR if you can find one. 

But yea I got the Pint with the intention of upgrading to an XR so take what you will from this. In my local market I’ve seen used Plus for around $800-900 which is comparable to a Pint. 2100 seems like a lot but basically everyone says they’re built like tanks so I guess it’s okay (really not bad for the price in my area). Top speed isn’t a problem for me on the Pint since I just want to cruise. If I want to go fast I have other electric toys like a board or a car."
onewheel,ff8xnxi,t1_ff8unyq,1579699428.0,Ay I gotta go down to Knoxville go hunt down a tenant who hasn’t been paying rent lol. Wonder how hard it would be to take my OW on the plane? Knoxville sounds like a good ride lol
onewheel,ff8x1he,t1_ff8oelf,1579698878.0,Yea I think I described it poorly. Stiffer I described was probably closer to a normal sole. I haven’t ridden it in like dress shoe hard soles. Probably slightly stiffer than Adidas NMD’s stiffer. I’ve only had the Pint for a few days and haven’t really looked at the light bar since I was riding it after work and it’s kind of blinding to me in darker light lol
onewheel,ff83ozn,t3_es6bfk,1579665152.0,I’m new to the OW but I think it might be because I’m not triggering both both halves of the sensors. Ok stiffer sole shoes I can balance fine but with slippers with a flexible sole it disconnects for me. Again not much experience so could be wrong
Documentaries,ff7u67u,t1_ff7tgag,1579658446.0,You know after looking through their profile... I think they don’t realize that they’re defining cringe lol
teslamotors,ff7m597,t3_erfyjh,1579652845.0,Jesus a Model X and a GTR... I mean the car splitting in half is wild but damn that’s an expensive crash
Documentaries,ff7llhr,t1_ff7eimc,1579652464.0,I think the whole point of the documentary was to explain that he’s just living his life doing what he wants... If someone being happy living life how they want is cringe then boy you probably won’t end up like him lol.
ValveIndex,ff73oxl,t1_ff6z6hq,1579640492.0,Yup I bought beat saber as a joke but me and my wife have like 6+ hour goes at the game lol
ValveIndex,ff6vyjw,t3_erqc92,1579636003.0,"I got the Rift S and the Index at the same time and visually didn’t see much of a difference. I liked the Oculus see through cam more so I could avoid my wife’s dogs. Index has better sound, controllers, and comfort for longer sessions. If money’s an issue the Rift would have been fine. I kept the index 90% because the headset was more comfortable though lol."
TeslaModel3,ff6vlw9,t3_erq0a3,1579635794.0,I’m committed to backing in because there wasn’t a rear sentry cam before.
TeslaModel3,ff6v2au,t3_eryxwl,1579635478.0,Iirc mine was $750 for side windows and the back in two pieces. It was $100 extra for one piece in the back. Just easier to install two smaller pieces. The only time I can see the line where the two pieces over lap is if my face is 2 inches from the interior of the window lol.
onewheel,ff6qqhp,t1_ff6qddm,1579632903.0,"Yea they probably just become background noise to them though lol. Me and my friend used to race and we pushed around 20+mph on fixed gears and he’s had someone taking a picture back up into him. Dude went flying and got mad at us... I mean it’s not even like he got hit, he just walked into a speeding bike and spun away like a tornado lol"
onewheel,ff6q6o0,t1_ff6jldx,1579632578.0,"As a former biker, yes.. lol. I mean there’s clear marking it’s a bike path so why would you gather a dozen people to take a selfie there?!?"
boostedboards,ff6grcu,t1_ff6bnn6,1579626853.0,I’ve got them on my Stealth as well! Doesn’t it make your board feel like a weapon? Pretty sure I cracked a tile putting my board down lol
boostedboards,ff6glla,t1_ff6ewq8,1579626755.0,"I wouldn’t compare a car to a Boosted board lol. Wasn’t their slogan something like “The last mile vehicle”? As much as I love my boards they’re honesty all toys to me. I can see people making short commutes on them but I’ve gotta assume most people just use them for fun...

So yea alot of money for some cool toys yes..."
gaming,ff6fvjv,t1_ff65cn2,1579626305.0,"I’m not saying you’re wrong but no one should have a $5 shitty mic. My best friend has some busted ass cheap mic and it sounds like he’s deepthroating it while he’s trapped in a wind tunnel. Gotta mute him it’s so bad lol. But yea he’s probably like this guy, waste tons on partying then complains he has no money to buy a cheap mic smh"
ElectricSkateboarding,ff664yu,t3_erfjih,1579620055.0,My brother in law was asking me about this since he snowboards and I got a few eboards. I didn’t see many reviews so I suggested a OW or something. After seeing this I’m mildly tempted to tell him to just buy it so I can try it and compare it to the OW I picked up the other day after looking for a snowboard alternative for him. Kinda doubt it would be a fun ride for him though. I think that lunatic wanted to ride from Mill Basin to the Freedom Towers lmao. Don’t think the range is there and I’ve done it on a Boosted Stealth and I can’t say it was super enjoyable due to the shitty streets.
onewheel,ff651rj,t3_ervgoa,1579619305.0,I’d say just get one if you can. I see nothing wrong with the current line up. If anything I’d assume they drop a more polished XR similar to the Pint. I was 50/50 on which to get and was thinking maybe I’ll get whatever new one they drop in the future and a Pint now. My wife has only snowboarded (real easy green trails) or gone in straight lines on my eboards but she loves the Pint. I’ve been riding it in the house since the weathers bad and she keeps asking to ride it so at this point I’m just going to give it to her and grab an XR lol... but until then this Pint is mine and I’ll fight her.
FashionReps,ff5bkv5,t3_ereukg,1579586300.0,"Yea so I went to a private school with uniforms so I have no idea wtf other kids wore but as an adult if I saw someone decked out in designer clothes I’d think most people wouldn’t be thinking wow look at all that nice shit. It’d be more like Jesus that clown has idea how to save money lol. Most of the stuff I buy is pretty low key and I never understood the box logo stuff that seems so popular. Me and my wife probably make more than the average person and we have mostly real pieces like CG coats or LV wallets and bags but reps are best when they’re something I can’t find retail due to season or they’re just too expensive to justify. Maybe I like really like the Mastermind x Adidas NMDs so i splurge and get the real ones but I’m not buying every Yeezy color way or way just because I think they look cool and can afford them. That money is way better spent on a house or a car lol. Amazes me the amount of people I see wearing Gucci belts or some kinda crazy shoes and hopping into a beat ass 1990 corolla, like how do you waste money when you clearly have more important expenses?"
onewheel,ff4weyl,t3_erne0r,1579574063.0,Damn name looks familiar from the leaderboards but that XRs looking a little small? Maybe it’s cold lol
onewheel,ff4w3fb,t3_ermxm2,1579573845.0,Ay just got a Pint the other day but it was snowing so I spent the day riding it in the kitchen while I was making a lasagna lol
onewheel,ff4o413,t3_erjw9p,1579568338.0,Wow I’ve only ridden a mile so far (indoors lol) but my wife’s gonna be mad when she sees me doing shit like this. Wonder how hard it’ll be to balance while going sideways...
funny,ff4j39l,t1_ff3fzaq,1579564825.0,MIL came to America as part of a contract to work as a city nurse along with her friends. My wife is now a nurse and most of my MILs friends children are nurses now as well. It’s kinda funny... also makes me want to be a nurse... sounds like a great job if you can handle the stress
onewheel,ff26nft,t3_er7r32,1579495316.0,I just got one yesterday and left it in the cold ass basement last night. Pretty sure it said in the app I got a notification saying it was too cold when I turned it on. Just needed to warm up a bit and it was fine. Part of EVs really. Even my car doesn’t run at peak when it’s cold out so I need to precondition so the regen brakes work lol
TeslaLounge,ff1pf4x,t1_fezwfx1,1579483235.0,Lol when that song was popular everyone kept blasting it at me because of my ethnicity. I secretly loved it hahaha
teslamotors,ff1mjyb,t3_eqxi2p,1579481657.0,My MIL asked me about it yesterday. I just shrugged and said I’ve never had a problem or heard anyone else talk about it lol. Didn’t even know it was a thing being spoken about on the media. I looked it up and an article said thousands complained but I just laughed because this sub would’ve been the first place I saw those complaints.
onewheel,ff1m0qn,t3_er1fqv,1579481394.0,I got a Pint with the fender and extra bumper bundle yesterday from a guy selling it for $800. Had 18 miles and I feel like that was a pretty good price. Would payed $800 for it without the extras.
todayilearned,ff0huno,t1_ff0crks,1579469006.0,Essentially the plot of Netflix’s “Messiah” lol
onewheel,ff01yiv,t3_er0fdm,1579464362.0,Think you linked an ad there my guy
vaporents,ff01ccj,t1_fezv1sb,1579464088.0,Also try an adapter for a bubbler or bong or something. I haven’t tried it but the adapters are cheap and I have a bubbler for my crafty too and I can tell a difference. Im at the point I have so much gear but honestly if I had an induction heater and some kind of adapter for the Dyna I would be satisfied with just that. Volcano is amazing but I probably spent a grand on it and at the end of the day it all does the same stuff lol
AskReddit,fezcply,t3_eqjrvi,1579455983.0,"Man I scrolled for a while but League of Legends. Still wildly popular but I’ve been playing since it came out almost and own a few hundred skins and all the characters. I’m absolute trash and never play anything but aram or the other limited time game types. 

Next to that is Enter the Gungeon. Every run is totally unique and I’m trash at that too."
AskReddit,fezc9o1,t1_fetlv90,1579455883.0,There was another fable that I alpha tested like 2 years ago that got canceled. Probably the earliest I ever got to play a game. Like there were just checkerboard characters and walls in a bunch of points it was so beta but boy did I feel some type of way when they said it was canceled
vaporents,fez8548,t3_eqy9de,1579454689.0,Yea definitely the heat since you can’t control it as precisely as an electric. Putting it through water helps as well. Dyna for me is a little harsh after the second heat up. With my crafty it gets harsher around 380. On my Volcano I use an obsidian (bubbler) and I can pump it up to 400 no problem.
TeslaLounge,fez6xtg,t3_eqwv9r,1579454407.0,My front tires have been showing 38 for like 2 months when it’s cold. Only the left is yellow if it dips below 30 degrees lol.
AskReddit,fez2hbm,t3_eqouu3,1579453234.0,"My old WiFi’s default name was “SilverCedar” which I used as my handle for a while. Reset the router and it became “GoldCedar” so I thought to myself it’s a fuckin cult of cedars. Here we are...

Before that it was something like “Blazedog”. People thought I smoked a lot of weed but nope. My ot was just my dogs name. I’m just not creative."
airsoft,feyzwi7,t3_eqvueo,1579452541.0,I have a few guns but 99% of the time I just run a glock like this (but it’s a TM). At a certain point I just feel like using the mags to “stab” people lol
ebikes,feysv4x,t3_eqwlrp,1579450198.0,What’s the point of fatter tires if you’re not using them right? It’s always fun to ride in some tougher terrain once in a while lol.
dji,fewcb90,t1_fewb5r3,1579408289.0,I’m actually cool with real estate since I like architecture but I’ve tried doing some paid work for modeling  and even though they loved it I just felt like it was shit and could’ve done better. Maybe it was conflicting styles or something (not the biggest fan of glamours glowing ig style stuff). I was lucky enough to have a project in a gallery where some people bought some prints I could I was proud of but I took that as the beginning and end of my photography career lol... back to college I go so I can get an easy city job I guess haha
onewheel,fewbnqm,t3_eqq6rt,1579408028.0,"Damn I’m loving the culture around the OW and understand it’s built for terrain but I cry every time I see mud caked grip tape. I always clean my eboards with grip gum if I see a speck on them so It looks like imma be running these batteries down without touching the floor lol. Don’t let me ruin anything though, keep cruising and having a good time man!"
dji,fewarv3,t1_fewa197,1579407671.0,God damn you’re living the life then! I got a degree in art/photography just because I needed one but I can’t handle the pressure of satisfying a client lol
dji,few9oxz,t1_few8hx8,1579407240.0,Yea you’re probably not crazy if you feel a difference lol. I went from a Mavic Platnium to FPV and it really messed me up. When I got the Pro I was half expecting it to do flips through trees at 1000mph. Either way you’re definitely way more experienced than me since I just fly it for fun haha
dji,few89ns,t1_few7ui0,1579406797.0,Ah totally fair. Have you ever tried FPV because yea it’s like everything you think you know goes out the window. Very satisfying once you get it down and you can get some crazy smooth action shots as well.
onewheel,few7v23,t1_few6uyp,1579406616.0,Lol thanks! Been snowing all day so all I got to do was smash into a wall in the basement so far... got a used bundle with a fender and rail guard and 18 miles for a good price though so I’m happy
dji,few7mne,t1_few6m3g,1579406500.0,"Ah I found a [pic](https://i.imgur.com/m8K4JS2.jpg) from after the fall. Got some cool shots like [this](https://i.imgur.com/zt6DaZw.jpg) since I was testing the night capabilities but yea probably pretty dumb to fly at night since I couldn’t see thin branches through the camera feed and I was cruising above the tree line for a video. 

Any reason you’d pick a v2 Phantom over the Mavic Pro? Is the video or camera quality that much better than the portability?"
dji,few6bj9,t1_fet9y59,1579405900.0,My Mavic Pro 2 fell through a tree from about 50ft. I had it wrapped so not a scratch on it but all the props exploded. I’m amazed it was totally fine beyond the props. I’d kinda expect Phantoms to be able to endure more abuse since the wings are fixed but at least you got your money’s worth out of it.
onewheel,few5a63,t3_eqlo9t,1579405608.0,Damn the XR really does look kinda big. Glad I got a Pint since it fits in my car nicely but I’ll pick up an XR when I get that big fat tax refund lol. Maybe let my wife ride the Pint since she seemed surprisingly excited when I got it today.
teslamotors,few2mgl,t1_few2508,1579404612.0,Oh yea it’s been like half a year since that or the phone charging cables were included. I feel like there was something else minor that was removed at the same time as well but I can’t remember lol
IAmA,few1ru8,t3_eqmcjh,1579404267.0,"What’s you’re general opinion on electric cars? Would you like to see Mercedes convert their whole line to electric or do you think they need to keep some ICE? I personally like riding bikes and skateboards but needed to drive so my wife got me a Tesla basically. She previously (still owns) a big ass GL350 or something? 

The interior materials are definitely better but she definitely likes the Tesla more between the updates, acceleration, and general technology that it has over the Benz (AP, Netflix, huge live traffic map). While she says she wants another Tesla I feel like if there were more high end luxury options from other manufacturers she’d be swayed because of the name. I also feel like the odds of another manufacturer throwing out biweekly updates to performance is unlikely though so what do you think the odds of that happening are?"
teslamotors,few0ijv,t3_eqpuow,1579403732.0,Both me and my wife were registered on our car. It’s mostly under her name (basically got it so I’d driver her around since I don’t like driving) but yea I never signed anything lol. I see the first thing was registered people need to sign but maybe that’s by location? Mildly curious if that’s the case or if they just slipped up
ebikes,fessoww,t1_fesogjc,1579368618.0,In nyc you have the right to ride down the middle of its too tight. I’ve never said a word to any cyclist as long as they’re not dicking around and aware they’re not the only one on the road (kids popping wheelies and shit and just blocking the street are another thing). I will give a polite little honk if someone’s in a car going 5mph down a street though lol
ebikes,fesrzaw,t1_fesqtmz,1579368402.0,Yea my daily commute is in NYC down a nice long street with a bike path that has tons of room. It’s well lit but occasionally someone will fly down the road (not the bike path) on an ebike or scooter. Spooks the shit out of me because of course I don’t want to hit someone with two tons of car. I’ve got lights on my bikes and my eboards so I know they work but Jesus fuck some people are cruising with no concern for anyone else.  At a minimum a light would be cool so I know they’re there. I’ve got absolutely no problems going down a street at 5mph if it’s too tight to pass.
UberEATS,fesiirx,t1_fepqom0,1579365554.0,I only rode during the dinner rush and yea I averaged around the same and rarely got tips. I assumed people who complained were in more rural areas. Most the money if it was from quest or whatever they were called.
ebikes,feshrhm,t3_eqhfg0,1579365277.0,I’m cool with this as a cyclist and a driver. But if you’re gonna do this at night please get some lights...
teslamotors,fep6whg,t1_feonr0o,1579313487.0,"Damn downvoted for an opinion. You’re right it might change, it also might not. I think the Taycan looks awesome inside and out. Still love my 3 and if I had to drop that much I’d rather get an X. If I were a rich man I’d probably get a Taycan too! I thought the whole idea was for society to move towards EVs and not create a monopoly lol"
onewheel,fencbtc,t3_epzri1,1579281639.0,"As someone who’s been boarding for years (like 20 at this point) between trick skating, long boarding, snowboarding, and eboarding... the answer is to combat roll out. You’re right you’ll probably land on the arm of your lead side but you really have to be ready to continue with a kind of parkour tumble so that your shoulder doesn’t take the full momentum of the fall. I’ve seen people hit their side and slide on their face before and it’s not pretty but yea that shoulder guard definitely won’t hurt so great job! Just try to add on to the protection with a proper roll and you’ll be invincible (don’t quote me on that though)"

I actually decided not to join when they gave me my academy date even though it was my dream job as a kid but I’d like to think I got some nice eye sight out of the journey lol.

But I’d definitely research and talk to an optometrist if you can to see if you’re a good candidate for lasik and they should have way more info than I have on the subject lol"
UberEATS,fefhpyx,t1_fefgqlw,1579056561.0,"Yea I’m not sure exactly what causes it but I went to a pretty good (and crazy expensive) place.

Minor eye irritation for like a day or two after the surgery but besides that I just popped the eye drops and had no issues. My father and mother also have had it done (whole family went to the same place) and they have no issues at all. 

If you feel like your vision is bad enough to get it it’s probably worth it. On a side note I used to wonder (not realistic at all) what would happen if I were trapped on an island or lost in the woods and broke my glasses. You’ll never have to worry about that again!"

UberEATS,fefagqt,t1_fef58vi,1579051990.0,"Pretty sure it’s not everyone but for me lights just look extremely bright. The best example I can give is with a cameras aperture based off this [image]( https://i.imgur.com/ssLITX4.jpg). If normal is 2.8 than I’m constantly at 22. Anything from street lights to tail lights are blinding so I can’t really look near them at all. If an emergency service vehicle is behind or in front of me I’d probably need to pull over until they’re out of sight lol. This is all with 35% tints on my side windows and auto dimming/tinting rear view mirrors. 

It was an immediate thing for me. I’ve heard other people have that problem but for some it fades. My sister got it done and she has trouble with lights at night but not as bad as me. I honestly just don’t drive at night or if I do I avoid the highway. I’m in the city though and there’s tons of lights. If I’m out in the middle of no where it’s cool and I’m fine. Just bright lights in general can blind me even during the day. But sunglasses fix that. 

But yea I got it to pass the NYPDs vision requirements and I must’ve been blind as hell because totally worth it in my opinion. I had some sniper vision when I got tested as in better than 20/20. I think my optometrist said it was better than 20/15. If you really have bad vision I’d get it because there’s nothing like waking up in the morning and seeing shit clearly."
teslamotors,feebcd7,t3_eo7zkj,1579030251.0,"I wrapped mine myself with 3M and Avery. It was the cheapest option and I have tons of time to kill. Total for the material was ~$600 with tons left over... like at least half rewrap the car after I redid the entire back. All I used were razors and a heat gun which cost like $20 (I used tape on the trim though). Then I put a matte ceramic fit on it which was ~$100.

It came out pretty [good](https://i.imgur.com/xB0jA5W.jpg) for someone with 0 car wrapping experience. But yea idk if everyone can do this. It requires time and patience and my wife had neither in her attempts to “help” lol"
teslamotors,feea80c,t1_fee922s,1579029595.0,Yea I mostly just left it half closed where the door is cracked and that stopped it from reconnecting unless the door was opened again. Turning off Bluetooth on my phone locked me out because I always forgot Bluetooth was off and disconnecting my phone in the car didn’t help because it reconnects so fast lol
teslamotors,feea1q2,t3_eohmhi,1579029493.0,"I’d say the biggest part of FSD right now is NoAP. Summon is kind of just a party trick that I’ve never actually used. If I didn’t live in NYC or a major city I’d say maybe. Like if I had a long commute with emptyish highways it would be great. 

As of right now NoAP which is FSD just can’t handle the high traffic and short exit ramps at times here. Tight traffic means it’ll never auto lane change because you basically need to cut people off to lane change here. If you do get an opening I’ve had it begin the lane change and jerk back when another car is near. On an empty highway some of the exits are really short and it might miss it if I’m moving ~55mph. 

That said I’ve seen major improvements since I g out the car with NoAP since the spring. I really do want FSD to work reliably but I just can’t trust it as it is now. On longer trips out of the city I absolutely love it though. It even handles some of the higher speed winding roads upstate pretty well. But yea if I only drove in the city it’d be next to useless. I personally could have gone without it and been satisfied with the standard AP

Mildly curious if other people here in NYC have FSD because everyone else I’ve spoken to with a Tesla in person has said no."
teslamotors,fee8xlc,t1_fedy8c3,1579028837.0,I’ve got a big ol JBL speaker and my wife always brought it out in the summer when I was washing the car. She had to hide the phone inside because it always switches to the car when I opened the door lol. That and when I spent like 3 days straight wrapping my car I had to deal with that. I just left the doors open as much as I could lol
vaporents,fee8a1b,t1_fee6gzf,1579028448.0,Yea I must’ve started watching after that happened since I’ve always seen it lol.
UberEATS,fee17j6,t3_eok0g4,1579024261.0,I got Lasik and it fucked up my eyes so at night all lights are blinding to me. I do feel bad because I’ve been told my head lights look like spotlights but I’ve never actually seen them from the front lol. They are stock though.
ElectricSkateboarding,fee05dg,t1_fedyz3j,1579023566.0,It’s pretty easy. I posted [mine](https://reddit.com/r/ElectricSkateboarding/comments/ed26aq/deck_swapped_meepo_mini_2_er_with_121c_aileron/) where I swapped to a carbon fiber kick tail deck. Hardest part is probably removing the cable that connects the battery to the esc which is kinda glued in. I personally used a heat gun which you can get for around $15 off amazon and removed the stuff with a screw driver then I just pulled it out. No risk of damaging anything really. All in all it turned out pretty good but the carbon fiber decks tail flex is spooking me.
vaporents,fedzido,t3_eokbhm,1579023172.0,Makes me wonder how channels like Erick Khan exist. I play that in the background sometimes while I’m gaming but the dude just smokes joints and talks lol. Pretty sure I’ve had a live stream going where he was just plowing through the stuff. Pretty shitty of YouTube to restrict people just living their lives... it’s not illegal everywhere
onewheel,fecs8dt,t1_fecrs71,1578982636.0,Np I’ve seen tons of OWs along that path and on the Coney Island boardwalk. Just careful if you go down the Neptune bike path. We’ve got a special kind of stupid driving over here along with the cars who park in the bike lane sadly. But yea besides that it’s a pretty scenic ride with no stopping which isn’t that easy here in NYC lol. Marine park/Gerritsen Beach definitely have some dirt trails if you want. Occasionally along the second half of my trail you’ll catch people on atvs and dirt bikes. Totally not legal but probably the closest thing to trails in the city
onewheel,fecr6db,t3_eoeb0d,1578981553.0,"Entire edge of Brooklyn from the bottom of Sunset Park to Cesars bay is a bike path. From there I go along the belt parkway where it’s basically empty streets/sidewalks and down Neptune (bike path kinda iffy or you can keep along the water and ride the boardwalk). Once you hit the end of Neptune it hits another bike path which goes along the belt to Lidenwood maybe? Tons of parks to cruise in along the way too (Calvert, Marine, that new one by Gateway). That’s like pavement or trails if you want to ride through the park. Dunno how long it is in total as I usually rode a bike along that but towards manhattan into Harlem on the weekends. Lots of places to charge as well. A few Starbucks along the way and what not.

Something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/5Z8AD6S.jpg). The red would be dedicated paths no stopping no cars. The green is all bike paths on the road but you can detour of course. Once you hit the marine parkish area I know there are actual dirt trails out there. If you’re anywhere in the Coney Island - Marine Park area I’ll probably be somewhere near by cruising some kind of EV lol. Let me know if you find any other cool paths!"
IAmA,fec2cbf,t1_febft4i,1578965637.0,Yea wth I know a guy who works as one in Park Slope in Brooklyn. Not even in the city and he told me it was a little more than $20 an hour. I’d assume in the city you’d make more than that... then again $15 is minimum wage here and anyone could probably get a ~$20 an hour job if they wanted.
worldnews,febwyj9,t1_fea9aik,1578963662.0,I live like a block away from an NYPD horse stable. I see them pretty frequently and they’re huge. Even got fuckin head butted by one while I was petting it lol. But yea they exist pretty much for riot control and what not. Their sole purpose is to be intimidating because they’re absolute fuckin units.
pics,febdv79,t3_eo4co6,1578957818.0,Nice shot! I looked through your others on ig and they’re great man. If you ever need a buddy to morally support you I’m out here in Brooklyn too lmao. Me and my friend used to stroll around the city taking candids until his camera broke haha
onewheel,fea9pyb,t1_fea6q45,1578946029.0,I placed an order for one but 99% of the time it’ll be used to ride to my car lol. I have a designated spot at my apartment but it’s about half a mile away for some reason
videos,fe8tkvq,t1_fe83gwb,1578930707.0,Easy to be when you own one and see how much it cost to maintain and dock though.
Showerthoughts,fe64qy1,t1_fe453dn,1578881756.0,We had someone we played with back in the MW2 days who popped up on national TV for murder iirc. He had a very unique name and we joked about it when we saw it.. then we read some articles and yep it was the dude we knew. We knew he had some problems raging (everyone does in FPS games) but yea we pretend we don’t know that dude now lol. Still on our Xbox friends list though.
teslamotors,fe4od92,t3_enpfe1,1578861334.0,"In my case my free autopilot (my wife) stopped driving and makes me drive her everywhere. I never had a car before that and was pretty content with a bicycle. So yea maybe that’ll happen and you get the car all to yourself lol. 

For the app you can assign quite a few times phone, cards, or fobs so it’s not much of a problem and your seat profiles and mirrors are assigned to the phone."
onewheel,fe09nm0,t1_fdyny9z,1578806995.0,+1 for hairdryer. Makes it way easier. I was changing grip on a skateboard and was too lazy to get my heat gun. Grip tore as I was pulling it and I hit my knuckle on what was still attached. Few seconds later I realized my hand was dripping blood and I ripped the flesh off my knuckle almost lol
dji,fdzg3wk,t3_endjfn,1578789923.0,"I thought I was the on my loser when I wrapped [mine](https://i.imgur.com/EfzsGP4.jpg). Yours will get lost in the vegetation, and mine will be lost in the dark (if the lights go out crashing)."
apple,fdskeqx,t1_fds4ir5,1578704290.0,I’m with you man... Xbox and ps4 have never turned off either lol. I used to like btc on my gaming desktop when I wasn’t using it since I had dual 1080tis. One of the GPU fans broke (out of 3) but yea surprising not much else did.
onewheel,fdpk0c5,t1_fdpjowj,1578630727.0,Yea I’m thinking Pint now and maybe if FM wants to release a new version of the XR in a year or two I’d be down to buy it.... and by that I mean I’ll probably be on the preorder list like I was for the last few Boosted boards lol... I see no reason I wouldn’t love a OW... just hyping myself up at this point!
onewheel,fdpitli,t1_fdpdgzl,1578629780.0,14 cruising sounds fine to me! I’m just curious how far it can be pushed before it gets dangerous since I’ve seen some people saying they hit 20 on a Pint while I was looking it up. But yea biggest advantage to the OW seems like the terrain it can handle. I ride through some areas with absolutely busted roads.
onewheel,fdpimuv,t1_fdpgmi2,1578629637.0,I feel you lol. Both of my current eboards were gifts so I can’t see myself ever selling them! I never even considered the bus and stuff with a OW. Would I just drop it on the side or hold it?? I remember taking my Boosted on the train was a hassle since it was so long.
