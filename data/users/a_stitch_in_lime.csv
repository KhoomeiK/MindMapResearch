ThatLookedExpensive,ff68m9q,t1_ff5xkiz,1579621706.0,"Interesting story about this topic (at least I think so). Just this past weekend, I discovered my water heater died and it was time to replace it. Called around for a few quotes, including a plumbing company I'd used before as well as one I was connected to via Home Depot. 

Company A estimated about $2300-2500. Everything included, unless they ran into anything unexpected. Company B sent me through some phone tree to a person that sounded like they were reading a phone script and gave me 3 ""levels"" of installation with varying degrees of stuff included, lengths of warranty, etc. I selected the one that sounded comparable and she gave me a quote of $2000. Plus, since it was through home depot I could pay with my card and pay it off over a few months without interest.

I decided to go with A, on a gut feeling. I'd used their services, they're local and sounded more professional. I figured let's pay a little extra to do it right, right?

Installed yesterday for a total of $1700. I ended up paying less in the long run, because some of the contingencies they estimated around weren't needed and they didn't charge me for things they didn't do. Couldn't have worked out better!"
