Imagine if you were a being of infinite creation that could create any reality imagined. At first maybe you'd create a godly realm of pleasure and ecstasy but how long could that novelty last? You may even create realms upon realms to explore and perform ""mystical"" acts of delight. You'd eventually exhaust every possible scenario knowing nothing can truly hurt you and eventually realizing the weight of who you are to be more burdensome than anything else. What pleasure could satiate someone/thing that is pleasure itself?

Eventually you'd come to a point maybe after several millennia (and what's time to you, after all) in which you would seek a real challenge, something to really throw you on your ass. So you'd choose to forget everything that you are so you can experience the full range of novelty of not knowing. You'd throw yourself so far off the deep end that you'd laugh and laugh at the grand cosmic jokes you can play on yourself; Maya.

This is what I saw. This is what I know. This is what I am. And this is what ""you"" are as well."
