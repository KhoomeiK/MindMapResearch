Dissociative disorders are extremely complicated and nuanced, and disassociating as a symptom appears in trauma disorders such as PTSD and borderline. Many doubt that DID is even real, as it is both extremely rare and the most intense dissociative disorder there is.

The vast majority of people who dissociate do not have DID. Daydreaming can trigger disassociation, but not al daydreamers suffer from it.

Dissociating is absolutely terrifying. It’s an involuntary coping mechanism."
MaladaptiveDreaming,ffjkegp,t3_etxfkc,1580000238.0,"I both disassociate as a part of my bipolar and bpd, and I have MD. 

I can draw distinctions between the two.

A regular daydream is intentional. It’s a game and I’m very much in control of things. I’m aware more or less of my surroundings and I can toggle between the real world and my dream world with ease.

On the other hand, disassociating is not voluntary. I have no concept of time and I feel as if I’m not in control of my own body, thoughts, or emotions. This is followed by brief but intense feelings that I don’t exist, or that the world around me is fake, or that people can hear my thoughts, or that I can’t feel my body. I may see the world in-front of me as if it’s being projected on giant screens. Words tend to swirl around my head and lose meaning. People feel like they’re watching me or following me. Sometimes I lose the ability to feel my clothes draped around me, or I’ll think the wind is being blown at me by a fan. Things feel fake.

Sometimes when I’m daydreaming, I begin disassociating. However, daydreaming is not necessarily disassociating. Daydreaming is just a common trigger.

I also disassociate when I write or draw or when I’m alone in a big crowd.

But no, Daydreaming isn’t disassociating. It’s a trigger for some, but I know my daydreams are fake."

There’s also the chance that he’s trying to appear more environmentally friendly to compete with Bernie Sanders for a presidential spot.

Those aren’t good reasons, but they’re not the worst."

Saying, ya, the power went out, but we get to roast marshmallows is empathizing with her fear, which can be helpful."

MaladaptiveDreaming,ffghjzl,t3_etcvmj,1579906383.0,"Lol, same.

Protip: doodle your daydreams and draw the expressions as you make them.

When people ask what you’re doing, show them the picture and claim it’s accidental. People find it cute when artists make expressions like that. Easiest if you have an animated style."
MaladaptiveDreaming,fffv1cj,t3_et8dx2,1579892406.0,"Lol, I have a shower speaker, waterproof  with excellent sound. 

I don’t tend to daydream in the shower though, cuz I’m naked."
dbtselfhelp,ffft1ce,t3_etdk8z,1579891168.0,"As someone who values words, I think the word ‘but’ can be quite positive.

Sure the power went out, but that means we get to light a fire in the fire place and roast marshmallows."
