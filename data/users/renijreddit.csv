politics,ffczafp,t1_ffbts9n,1579810337.0,"Stop berating people on your side.  The truth is human beings usually have to experience something for themselves to change their minds.  That is why Medicare For All Who Want It is the best path forward.  Everybody will eventually want it, they just have to have a bad experience with their current insurer first.  You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink until he is good and thirsty.  Sad, but it is the way of the world, grasshopper."
Pete_Buttigieg,ffcq7hp,t3_esq46r,1579804919.0,"Why do bernie supporters think he'll help the poor?  Over the span of his mayoralty in Vermont, the number of families living in poverty grew — to 798 in 1990 from 563 in 1980, an increase of 42 percent.

politics,ffcnria,t1_ffcjonp,1579803379.0,"Sanders is so establishment it's not even funny - he's fucking been in congress for decades.  And he's not even a democrat.  Why the hell does the democratic party allow him to run as one?  Ugh - whatever.  

The only way we won't have a President Trump in 2021 is for us to actually be Progressive.  Not try to blow up the whole thing just like a mirror image of trump.  Warren had a good chance to be the one, but she jumped on the bernie train not only in healthcare but then started playing the ""wine caves are sooo last election"" game.  Warren and Sanders are going after all progressives who aren't willing to throw out the good parts of capitalism just to get the woke ""vote"".  The reason for the quotes is that the woke will be too busy throwing temper tantrums to actually go out and vote on the actual election day - after primary day, they'll just check out like always and we'll have trump.

We need someone who is interested in actually doing the job of governing *and* leading - and has the vitality to actually do both.  I'm sorry that bernie lost his chance last time - I voted for him in the primary.  Life's not fair snowflake - we need to move on to a new generation.  Pete is the only one who can beat trump.   #IAmTeamPete"

He liked to tinker with things, so they gave him a lab and promoted him to a staff scientist. This just doesn’t happen anymore. Maybe it’s that there is so much to know in the car of IBM, but I think companies structure work differently now. Or maybe it’s because all the jobs that you could be promoted to have moved overseas. I don’t know, but it is different."
Pete_Buttigieg,ff32fql,t1_ff2hxvn,1579531920.0,"Informative. But I would also argue that pets don’t complain, so maybe it’s more that people don’t know something is wrong because the cat (mostly) or dog doesn’t act like they’re sick. The pet owners I know would happily pay for any medical procedure that would help Fluffy. Even more than they would their 20 something kids."
politics,ff3237f,t1_ff31dvd,1579531653.0,"Well, since elections are held at the state level, I can guarantee you that red states will think up some way- maybe no voting machines or access in blue areas, maybe stricter voting laws. This very issue is why I’m Team Pete. He wants to eliminate the EC but also create a national holiday for Election Day and extend early voting and access to mail in ballots easier. Finally, overturning Citizens United and fixing the Supreme Court.  All of these issues need to be addressed. Even before climate, because we won’t be able to get anything done with the people."

Those geniuses on Wall Street known as “quants” to develop a way to determine the actual cost of living for each neighborhood.  Because 130k is a fucking fortune for some places and almost poverty in other neighborhoods.

Pete_Buttigieg,ff0dr6n,t1_ff0c4q7,1579467959.0,But if you trust that they know when to pull in a physician who is on site why not trust them to do it when they’re in another office?  Come on.....
todayilearned,ff0boto,t1_ff00rw1,1579467325.0,Then you and everyone else would opt for zero collected and then life would happen to a significant portion and we’d have elderly starving and living in the streets again. People significantly underestimate the actual shit that’s going to happen to them and then fuck themselves. This is the exact reason we have SS.
Pete_Buttigieg,ff0b4zw,t1_ff01gh6,1579467094.0,Why would there need to be physician supervision?  Can you give an example? It seems like protectionism to me. You know they can refer patients just like PCP’s do.
todayilearned,ff0apym,t1_ff01ny0,1579466940.0,"Welfare - to fare well. SS is and always has been a welfare program. No way the 80 year olds living today paid into the system what they are getting out of it. And many places don’t have enough smaller homes for people to move to and even if there were housing available, it’s most likely out of the price range for seniors."
todayilearned,fezv3yz,t1_fezlprd,1579462048.0,"Benefits stay the same, but higher incomes pay more into it. As for spousal payouts, that’s not really an issue that’s causing the system to come up short. Last thing we need is grandma to get evicted after grandpa dies because the SS check doesn’t cover the rent/property taxes."
Pete_Buttigieg,fezumlr,t1_feym2ou,1579461868.0,"How would you and your physician colleagues feel about nurses handling basic patient care?  IMHO it’s insane for a doctor to be seeing someone who has a sore throat. Doctors could offload the basic primary care to nurses and focus on the more challenging stuff. Then compensation would still be higher than what it should be for primary care. Thoughts?  

Oh, and also the AMA does set limits on how many medical students there are. That has to change."

The income range depends on your state, but I think you can get a subsidy if you make less than $50,000 per year. And the plans are required to cover most screening costs. The premiums might be higher than non-ACA plans, but if you get that for a year and your procedure is covered it might work out as a way to “pay monthly” for your treatment."
