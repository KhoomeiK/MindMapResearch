Anxiety,fds7xug,t1_fds7aor,1578696390.0,"Anxiety disorder - in my case it’s worrying 24/7, every single day, panic attacks for no reason, overthinking, paranoid about nearly everything, reading into things that aren’t there, panic for no reason, insecure for no reason, panic in non threatening situations, cannot switch my brain off at all, I worry way more than a normal person. It’s not anxiety in a threatening situation, it’s anxiety in normal situations I have no need to be anxious about. Being too scared to stand up in a group of people or talk infront of loads of people, being the first to do something."
