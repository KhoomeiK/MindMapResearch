PrequelMemes,ffpflun,t3_euc7cc,1580093838.0,The following seasons got better but I really like this initial arc with Yoda in TCW season one.
niceguys,ffnshh5,t3_eu4coh,1580070186.0,Imo this is more of a doomer than niceguy post.
PrequelMemes,ffl7e32,t3_eu1dzj,1580035893.0,Don't know what the troopers that saw him in battle and were with him on Kashyyk were thinking when they were told to execute order 66 and got real close to him.

VinlandSaga,ffi275k,t3_etpzxg,1579962897.0,"Since Thorkell already knows Thorfinn is heading to Vinland, they'll probably meet again and Cornelia will probably be there too.
It was a good chapter, entertaining but several pages were mostly demon Thorkell."
VinlandSaga,ffghh1l,t1_ffgf4md,1579906331.0,"I read it on [vinlandsagamanga.com](https://vinlandsagamanga.com/), you can pick up the ending of the anime at chapter 54 of the manga or pick it up directly in chapter 55. Kinda changes the setting all of a sudden, but don't worry.  

Is not necessary to read the manga from ch. 1 since everything is covered, but the first few chapters of the anime aren't in the same order as the manga's. I just picked it up at ch. 54 and it was pretty cool."

dating_advice,ffd1nma,t3_esylw4,1579811652.0,In my experience I guess if that person doesn't avoid you yet acts like your presence doesn't affect them in the slightest they probably don't like you. If they try to avoid you and they act nervously they might like you.

Animesuggest,femm0py,t3_epvkkg,1579262041.0,"Yay. And why yay? Besides animation, soundtrack, lovable characters it's a shonen that tries to add it's own elements to the genre. The character development is good imo, and the protagonist isn't as op at battles as it could be. On the downside it's starts rather slow, but after that just keeps its build up until the last few episodes. It pretty much looks and feels like a videogame.
Btw it's ok if you don't like shonen but it's still one of them."

ShingekiNoKyojin,fdzld8d,t3_en8v9t,1578791304.0,SNK has raised my standards so much. I still like shounen but I get bored easily if the plot isn't well thought. Currently reading Vinland manga.

I had to read the email address to realise it was from IBM. Still wasn't totally clear but I guessed that for the job position.
And since the job location wasn't clear from the start I couldn't follow because I'm far from that location.

What really bothers me is how bad the website for applications is."
