politics,ffaxn5i,t1_ffax3sp,1579746872.0,"Ok, the best thing you can do is vote for progressive candidates that support your values. Bernie is arguably the most Progressive candidate up there.
Local elections matter even more. Field those questions at town halls. Racism isn’t going to be healed overnight. It wasn’t fixed when Obama won. It’s obviously still here. I truly think that the people who still support trump are just flat racist. Last time I checked, that’s something like 38% of the country, so you got a lot of work to do."

There was no mention of *any* policies that he personally implemented... or any policies *at all*. Also, if you had read it, it’s encouraging because Vermont is taking major action to correct the systemic racism that’s *built into our culture*.
