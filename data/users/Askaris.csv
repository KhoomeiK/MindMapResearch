TalesFromRetail,ff6v6ki,t1_ff5g0ec,1579635546.0,"No, it's just a German thing I guess.

A lot of Germans still prefer to pay in cash and credit cards are not as common as in other countries. 
Some debit cards allow a credit-card like paying (only in some shops - and even in shops where it's theoretically possible it's still quite random). Instead of entering your pin (which will charge your account immediately) you have to sign either electronically or on a receipt and your bank account will be charged after days or even weeks. You don't know when exactly it will happen or if you get the option to pay by 'Lastschrift' at all beforehand."

todayilearned,fdwm9ho,t1_fdwizan,1578760155.0,"Oh, i misunderstood you.

At about 9 months my son would try to bite as well and caught me completely unaware. After some research I was able to teach him it's a no-go in two days. But I was really anxious for at least another two weeks. I know some mothers who weaned their child after one such incident, which is understandable, and there are certainly babies who will need more than a few days to get it. 

But the former is all about biting which is a different thing than being correctly and therefore painlessly latched on to feed. 

One tip, for example, to reduce the risk of biting is to break the latch as soon as your child is not 100% focused on drinking and swallowing anymore."
todayilearned,fdwimh4,t1_fdwg5ap,1578759019.0,"No worries, I actually hear it from formula-feeding mom's myself sometimes. 

I think it's an important part of promoting breastfeeding to clear up these kind of misconceptions. There are a lot of legitimate reasons not to want or being able to breastfeed but fear of having to endure constant pain shouldn't be one of them."
todayilearned,fdwfygu,t1_fdvx5ke,1578758256.0,"It's a common misconception that breastfeeding hurts as soon as the first teeth break through. If the baby is latched on correctly there aren't any teeth involved no matter how many there are. 

Some babies will try to bite the nipple while they are not drinking, but there are a lot of ways to teach them not to.

Generally breastfeeding gets easier the older your child gets."

One thing you have to take into consideration is that parent-child-bonding is very individual. In some cases it's a very strong love even in pregnancy, or it's instantly there when you hear the first cry. For some people it just takes some time. Maybe the latter would cope better with losing a very young child than the former. 

Maybe this is a good question for r/askscience?"
