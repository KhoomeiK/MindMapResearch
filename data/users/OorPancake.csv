Scotland,fff1rsv,t1_ffenua9,1579873335.0,"It's an Argyle and north west language (brought over with the Irish) and always been a minority language. 

I have nothing against it's continuing existence, most of the south of Scotland spoke what is now known as Welsh, but we've not used that for more than a millennia, so any ideas about it becoming the standard Scottish leid is just ridiculous.

(And if you think I speak the way I write, you are seriously mistaken. Unless you're from Scotland, you'd probably understand about one word in five.) :)"

Down to Mull, over to Oban and then through Kilmartin, will take you through the place where Artur mac Aedan (Prince Arthur, not King) took a sword from a Stone. (I shit you not, it wasn't pulled *out* of a stone, it was handed to him while  standing on the stone..)..anyway, that'll get you close to Glasgow.

Scotland,ffdskdl,t1_ffdngtp,1579827856.0,"What's going on here is an attempt to divide populations on the basis of what languages they either speak, or learn to speak.

It's one of reasons why the Northern Irish Assembly has done fuck all for years, the stupid cunts.

WGAF! Honestly!

English is Germanic and the English seem to hate the Germans, and the French, and the Greeks, Bulgarians, Polish.... well, pretty much every cunt, but think it's *very* intelligent to speak Latin or ancient Greek.

If people want to learn gaelic, fair enough.

If, however, they demand that people must learn and speak gaelic, then that's an entirely different matter, but I have never seen that, and it remains a fucking stupid argument over fuck all.

It's utterly irrelevant! They might as well argue over peoples right to learn and speak Portuguese."
