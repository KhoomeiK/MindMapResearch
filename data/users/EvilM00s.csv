depression,fckkzw1,t3_ehl4ep,1577727619.0,"Jesus. You're my hero. I didn't last but a third of my day. 

Coming home almost made it worse. My wife is also depressed... So it stands to reason, men being men, that I want to fix her problems for her. Obviously, I can't, and even if I could I honestly don't know if I have the spoons to give. 

Your level of commitment is admirable. Keep on going, and see what you can do to get help. There are programs for your situation. Ha, if only it was that easy, right?"
depression,fceq14z,t3_eh2ns3,1577622764.0,"Yeah. It takes so much effort just to get up out of bed, even more to go through the day and really do the do. It seems to me like it's not worth the effort at all, because a majority of the time crap falls apart anyway. 

Everyone wants to tell you ""If you do A, B is your result"" and I am here to tell you it's bullshit. Should be ""If you do A, B is the best you can hope for"". If you have no hope, this equation doesn't work. 

I don't want to die, I just want to stop hurting. I do not know how."
depression,fc0dvez,t3_efd66s,1577288111.0,"Today is Christmas. Yay. My depression didn't care. I still woke up feeling angry and hurt. I don't know what hurts, I just know it does. I have a great job, a great wife, money, and I even got laid last night- yet I wake up trying to find reasons to stay alive, let alone awake. Lucky me, it takes a cup of coffee's worth of time to break free of that in my morning.

The takeaway here is that even though my life is pretty good and I'm medicated for depression, there's still a struggle. I'm getting tired too. I recognize your struggle. It's not any external factor, it's my disease. My mental illness makes me feel like this. Unfortunately, nothing is going to get better untill I address the chemical imbalance responsible for my feelings. 

And after that, nothing will have changed, really. There will still be disappointment and struggle. The only difference will be that I'm ready to handle life with a healthy mind. That's all I want. No one can be expected to have a normal healthy life when their emotions are neither. Get with your physician. Change up your meds. I'm going to as soon as the holidays are over and the office is open. Evidently, vyybrid isn't cutting it for either of us."
