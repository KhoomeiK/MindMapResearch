confession,ff1zvnp,t1_ff1y8ab,1579490093.0,"You’re welcome! I know my advice wasn’t the best, it’s hard I can imagine especially when you have depression and don’t want to do a thing, that feeling really stops any productivity. 
Hopefully you can start building on the things you want to do, like, write. 
Good luck to you! You’re already putting forth the effort and thought process to fight your demons"

confession,ff1ww3y,t3_er6mw6,1579488033.0,"I’m sorry you’re going to this. This is going to sound silly but have you tried picking up a hobby? It doesn’t have to be corny like scrapbooking but anything to occupy your time when you’re not with your daughter. Even if you’re not good at it, just something you enjoy doing - I knew someone who would put together scrap metal, or just go to the junkyard to look at old beat up cars, just to get out of the house and avoid his addiction to opiates. This part is corny but finding things like, reading, walking, finding hiking trails, going on solo adventures, forcing yourself to be in people or in public. Going to the movies, book store, get some coffee, try finding a person to date, hangout with friends, fill your schedule with things that you enjoy or that you may enjoy or that force you out of your home to avoid drinking. 

The friend i mentioned above would have a hard time being home at all because it’s where he would get high so eventually he found joy in cars and metal, he would go to car meets, junkyards, research cars he liked, mapped out car ideas, put together car models, bought himself car video games, put together scrap metal etc.

Maybe start occupying your time with creating adventures or things to do with your daughter when you see her. Buy her those new Polaroid cameras and take photos together of your time together. Maybe helping her to make a scrapbook (I know I said I wasn’t going to mention scrapbooking but as a girl I loved this activity) of those photos and leave it at your home so you can look back on it and remember that you’re improving yourself for her, also so you wouldn’t feel so upset when she’s not around and you find hope that you’ll see her soon.  Ultimately reminding yourself that you need to be and do better for her.

Edit: added more ideas"
AMA,ff1we48,t1_ff1t26j,1579487694.0,Not sure to be honest. Some people with the condition don’t make it to see their 1st surgery and some have more than 5 their first couple years of life
AMA,ff1w6oo,t1_ff1v7ju,1579487558.0,"I was born with tetralogy of fallot - it’s a combination of 4 congenital abnormalities. It’s pretty rare condition. 

My 1sr surgery was to stitch up and “close” the multiple holes in my heart. I was told my pulmonary valve was “cut” during the first surgery to release pressure from closing up all the holes. Because of this cut valve my heart was expanding and was beginning to stress itself eventually leading me towards heart failure, so my 2nd surgery was a full pulmonary valve replacement using a pig valve.

Edit: grammar and punctuation"

3rd dog - itty bitty boi - is following my boyfriend around and playing musical chairs by himself (he moves from underneath every single chair every few minutes) 

1 cat - silky chonk - is at a window sill 

2nd cat - fluffy chonk - is in the hallway waiting for one of us to pass by to swipe at our feet (or paws)"

relationship_advice,ff1qdm0,t3_er5d37,1579483857.0,"She may just be emotionally spent and just not doing well mentally, not really noticing that she’s being contradictory. That’s happened to me before and it was hard to take notice of until it was brought to my attention. With that being said, my best advice is what was done to me while I was going through a tough time, literally ask her what she wants you to do, gently of course, tell her “you tell me to do something and I do it and you get upset, I really want to help you through this but I need you to tell me exactly how and I’ll do it”

If she gets mad that you leave, then don’t leave. Maybe leave the room and give her space, or just sit quietly next to her and try saying something like “I know you’re upset, I don’t want to leave with you upset, I’ll be right over here” 

That’s my best piece of advice. Good luck to both of you! I hope she feels better soon,"
offmychest,ff1pdgg,t3_er5dok,1579483206.0,"If you feel a mix of pressure and immense pain it’s definitely wisdom tooth. It could cause you to chew on the inside of your cheek accidentally and constantly. Wisdom tooth pain hurts like a bitch - for me it caused headaches, jaw pain and even slight fevers. If you can see the back of your mouth just to confirm that the tooth is grown and trying to break through your gum that would also confirm it.

Based on your previous comment, since you’re not good with pain - Orajel from the drugstore really helps, icing your cheek and your gum. It may be hard if you have sensitive teeth but just placing ice over the gum the tooth is trying to break through and holding it there will help. Eating soft food especially on that side of your mouth, like the other comment eloquently puts it - try not to chew on the side that hurts. 

Not to scare you, but just to give some insight - In some cases wisdom teeth grow out with pain but no further issue but sometimes it could also just shift all your other teeth if the tooth is growing sideways or if your teeth are already close together giving no space for the wisdom tooth, your other teeth will shift to accommodate. So if that’s something you’re concerned about I recommend finding a dentist that takes payment plans to just get that tooth removed or even a consultation."
AskReddit,ff1oisn,t3_er5dpk,1579482678.0,"I was raised Catholic - I’m not a practicing Catholic anymore although I still believe in God. 

It’s simple but my favorite thing, (I still do this) is doing the sign of the cross when passing a cemetery or a church. Its hard to put into words but it feels good. For a cemetery I say a little prayer and it feels like I’m paying my respects to the dead in a way. For a church, it’s just nice seeing a big cross in the distance, remembering there is more to the world than just me and my tiny problems, being reminded that God exists, and I’m just a tiny speck in the grand scheme of things."
AmItheAsshole,ff1nrtv,t3_er5dvz,1579482249.0,"NTA - To be honest I can see why your girlfriend is upset, I would be also because it’s someone you both knew/know and I could imagine she sees it almost like a personal attack on her (at least that’s how I would feel.) However, I don’t think you were the asshole - it doesn’t seem like it was done maliciously or with intent to cheat or whatever. 

She sent you the link, you and her tend to watch porn together,  etc. I’m not sure if she was hoping it wouldn’t make you horny so she sent it to you? It’s porn, it’s designed to make everyone horny - just because it’s a girl you knew doesn’t make it any different."

90dayfianceuncensored,fct6fqb,t3_ei92gf,1577934100.0,"She irritates me to NO END. She has the freakin audacity to have this (beautiful too good for her in my humble opinion) man come to the USA ON A FIANCÉ VISA FOR 90 DAYS. 

She’s not around for 30 of them - if she had this stupid witch doctor BS trip planned for so long she should’ve had him come at another time. 

She calls him clingy but he literally just asks her to let him know when she’s safe because she’s in a whole ass other country. 

Shes going on this stupid trip to learn how to put essential oils in Shea butter and insult actual doctors by calling herself one. She leaves him with her “super-particular-mother” who is just going to abuse the fact there’s a nice man visiting their bum asses for once and give him chores to do, 

I hate her that’s it"
