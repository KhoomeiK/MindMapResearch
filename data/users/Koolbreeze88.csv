I wanted to post a picture of him to see if someone could help and I felt really bad at the idea of him being documented looking like that. I can’t explain why but it felt weird sharing something so personal and I didn’t want anyone to remember him like that. I want people to remember how great he is not how sick.

Dogtraining,fe3oxaw,t1_fe3d9dy,1578851461.0,From the looks of this crowd I’m gonna get downvoted for my opinion.  This is the most likely situation that’s going to happen. Please don’t get rid of your dog cause it’s have some puppy issues. Let the dog know it’s not acceptable behavior. My dude is a year old and he has changed his personality like 4 times now. Your pups will evolve to be comfortable you just have to be patient and guide them.

todayilearned,fdt991c,t1_fdsjxvy,1578713582.0,I 100% hate that Spotify has a terrible ability to show me much new stuff. It just mashes up playlist of my personal playlist. If I put a song on a playlist it just keeps throwing those same songs at me in my “Discover Weekly” or the daily mixes it’s just my playlist regurgitated over and over. I get a few new songs every week if I just let Spotify try to figure out what I like. I also wanna say I listen to a shit ton of music and have my whole life. I guess there is only so much out there.

He started the issue by going outta turn... breaking the law that’s clearly in place to keep this nonsense from happening. Logically he should be ticketed right then. You should reconsider how you think about driving.

Dogtraining,fdjey2x,t1_fdj24el,1578467955.0,I had to do a reverse training technique. I started with a small basket and I would put the ball in the basket and have my dog get it out. Then I’d have him drop it back in. It took a week or so to get him to understand a new command but I used that to get him to drop it in the machine.

Eugene,fdaw6h8,t1_fdauvg0,1578251046.0,I live in the country and when I drive at night on 126 it’s like people are clueless to what they are doing. I hate regulations but putting a limit on head light brightness and ticketing drivers who make the road dangerous seems like it should be a thing. No you don’t need super bright lights on your car to make it home just because your in the country. The lights that come standard on a vehicle are pointed down btw.

RATM,fcwytno,t1_fcww2yh,1578043517.0,"RATM hasn’t put out an album in two decades and could probably sell out that event alone. I try to listen to everything but pop and country. Crazy to me I don’t know who they are had to look them up, they only got a few million views I don’t see what’s the big deal. I don’t ever experience I heart radio’s pop stars.

Edit: didn’t they get banned by some radio...?"
RATM,fcwokay,t3_ej9a0a,1578031713.0,"Crazy how RATM is the only literal big name on the whole lineup. They usually have few really famous people play. This year looks like a huge disappointment for someone trying to see famous bands you don’t normally get to see. I kinda figured that’s the whole point in paying so much and having to survive in a field for a few days. The last time they played 2008 it was RATM, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Bjork. I thought about trying to go and catch some new music and see some rare performances but it looks like a lot of random whatever bands that tour all the time. Most bands sets at festivals suck with the time constraints. I’d rather see a just them show."
