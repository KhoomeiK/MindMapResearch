SandersForPresident,ffj4t75,t1_ffii68x,1579990406.0,Hello fellow Bernie theologian!
SandersForPresident,ffj4rad,t3_ettkv7,1579990368.0,"Welcome friend, glad you're with Sanders like so many on this sub. Just want to touch on one part of your post:

> I am a Christian male. I believe in God, I pray before meals and before bed, I do pride myself in that and I am not ashamed to admit it. So anyway, I told you guys that I felt as though everyone hated me for it, well then I became more active online and I noticed something, they didn’t.

I'm Christian too--it's my faith that makes me identify with democratic socialism and a poor-first perspective. One thing I've found helpful is to stop and think about what it means to be a ""proud"" Christian, or to live out Romans 1:16: ""For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.""

I think being Christian doesn't mean being proud or tribal. We aren't ashamed of the Gospel because the Gospel says we're not better and not worse than anyone else--we're in need of God's saving and transforming, and so we ""boast in the Lord"" and not in ourselves (1 Cor. 1:31). I hope with Sanders people you'll find, as I have, that tribalism and identity politics are much further from the Gospel than work that lifts up the people who need the most help (like you and me). God bless you and welcome!"
ElizabethWarren,ffiuvkb,t1_ffijkcv,1579983307.0,"Thanks for this reply, and the substance of your comment correlates to the substance of mine: Warren is a very solid candidate who I would be proud to call my president.

I think you're right about Warren's claimed Cherokee heritage, insofar as she innocently claimed that heritage (and contributed to a Native American cookbook) because of confusion about her family lineage. The real ""baggage"" of the issue is that in the latter days of late 2018, she made the choice to release DNA results and claim a very cheap victory. Though it is much less important than her crucial plans for advancing Indigenous rights in the US (which are exemplary), a tone-deafness and lack of judgment like that still does give me pause.

As a Sanders supporter, the bigger issue is the CNN release (and you're right, Sanders and Warren were both personally hurt by the event). I feel you're right about the speculation that CNN would have been stirring up dirt from both campaigns. The problems are that: 1) Warren's campaign had dirt to give corporate media at all (Sanders' apparently didn't), and 2) Warren doubled down on the most divisive interpretation of the conversation. Her words during the debate:

*I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look. **This question about whether or not a woman can be President has been raised, and it’s time for us to attack it head-on**. I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people’s winning record.*

That bolded sentence is an indication that Warren intended to use one interpretation of that conversation for maximum effect, in concert with CNN's reporting angle, in the last debate before the caucuses. And that, to me, seems like politicking from a candidate whom I love because she doesn't do politicking like that"
ElizabethWarren,ffiik7b,t1_ffh2koa,1579974714.0,"I’m a Sanders supporter who also loves Warren. To me, the only “baggage” issues I can think of with Liz are the Indigenous ancestry saga and the timing of her disclosure about Bernie’s alleged comments to CNN.
