MedicalGore,ffbhaz7,t1_ffbcsre,1579765277.0,"would these be coated in mucus? i assume theyre pulmonary emboli removed with a catheter? so they wouldve been inside the arteries in the lungs, not in the bronchi/bronchioles where the mucus is... right?"
aww,ffavufu,t1_ffa0acs,1579745676.0,"nope, the muscles in your face (specifically the masseter, temporalis and medial pterygoid) pull your jaw up to your skull, closing your mouth

proof: you can hold your tongue in one position and open and close your jaw without using your tongue at all"
aww,ff9pn9k,t1_ff9ov0d,1579718139.0,"just fyi no none of it is true, there is no such thing as ""impulsive"" muscles. there are smooth and cardiac muscles in your body that work without your control but your tongue is most definitely a skeletal muscle that you have conscious control over"
MedicalGore,fei4sk9,t1_fehww8h,1579130281.0,"main risk of necrosis is that the immune system has no access to dead tissue. so dead tissue is easy food for bacteria and fungi, and once thse infect the dead tissue they can spread causing further necrosis. if the necrotic tissue was debrided (removed) at the hospital and the rest healed normally there isnt much risk"

aww,febnjmh,t1_fe95b85,1578960707.0,"thats true but skin pores only lead to follicles etc, not directly to the bloodstream like a break in the skin. ofc if a microbe gets in your pores it can cause an infection, such as a pimple, but i think that is minimally harmful. the skin really is a pretty great barrier to disease :)"
Cringetopia,febmr2m,t1_febfxzi,1578960505.0,yea i knew what you meant but this one came to my mind instantly

MemeThatNews,fcjpnbf,t1_fcjm155,1577698300.0,"i think its due to the fact fecal transplants help transplant good bacteria into the recipients instestines. after antibiotics the intestinal microbiome can be disrupted, allowing bad bacteria to colonize and take over, exacerbating IBS. bringing in new good bacteria can compete with the bad bacteria or colonize before them, and dont create any negative symptoms"
