OP says she needs surgery for the following :

———————
- oversized sinus stuff
- root resorption from 5 years of braces — need implants
- crossbite- can’t be fixed in most traditional methods due to root resorption 
- airway in throat (trachea) is small, the low end of normal range is 10mm and mine is 6mm 
- small lower jaw 
- oversized tongue

As a result of above I have a lot of symptoms. The most concerning is sleep apnea. Because of sinuses I am a chronic mouth breather/mouth snorer but trachea airway is still tiny. Essentially I could die in my sleep because my mouth and nose and throat are all “wrong” size and placement. 

I also have soreness in my jaw because I have to hold my teeth apart due to the crossbite.

My large tongue/small jaw means my tongue (the strongest muscle in your body) is constantly pressing against the teeth in my top jaw, adding movement and more root resorption. 

And. My two front teeth could fall out at any time because there are nearly no roots holding them in. Most docs are surprised I still have them. The optimal fix would be implants. Because of the shape of my jaw and other existing conditions, the implant has to be very exact. The team have doctors have said they will practice that surgery using VR 2-3 times before they do it, it’s so tricky. Insurance considers fixing this cosmetic. 

So basically I am going to have double jaw surgery, they are going to separate both my top and bottom jaw to spread things out and make more room for tongue. They will move the bottom jaw forward to increase airway space. Then they will reset the jaw so that the ortho can simply straighten my teeth and once done the jaw will be in the right spot/no crossbite. That way they don’t have to “pull” on my teeth any more than they have to. 

At some point much later I will get cleared to get implants screwed into my skull for the front 2 teeth. Then dentist will have to make the actual tooth to go into the implant. 

Then I need to have more sinus surgery (ENT) to remove stuff. I have already had a couple of sinus surgeries so the drama continues. 


—————————

Says she is 5’11 and 200 lbs which is a lie, she’s clearly much heavier.   Doctor won’t do surgery until she loses weight due to fat around neck and face.   She comes to this Facebook group for advice because they know more than doctors. 

As expected every one says fatphobic  doctors, and then this one suggests lipo instead"

Also if your body didn’t absorb nutrients you would lose, not gain weight. 

It is impossible to gain weight on 1200 calories a day plus 8 miles of activity a day."

Also how about extra weight not causing any health issues and all this perfect health stats.  Why even discuss morality when it comes to health since they’re all perfectly healthy already 🙄"
