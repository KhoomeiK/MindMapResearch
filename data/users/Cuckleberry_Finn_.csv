I also want it to be less fluff, and more straight to the point descriptions of everything that happens when you use an ability. 

Also, I dislike that the cast ranges are often left out. A diagram of the targeter and animation as to how it can be customized when cast (like Baron 1 or Yemoja 1) would be nice as well.

I consider some guys attractive and that’s that. I’ve since come out to my mom, but I’m still struggling with telling my older brother. He’s the only holdout and I can’t bring myself to say anything about it. 

While I was in those months of discovery, I was talking to him and he asked if I’d gotten laid since I started school. I hadn’t (though it was unrelated to my situation). He said that’s fine as long as I don’t turn gay. I’ve been hurt since then and I still have no clue how to approach the situation but when I finally tell him, I’m going to let him know that that was the most hurtful thing he’s said to me. 

A lot of people on this subreddit really emphasize removing negative people from your life, but I can’t bring myself to tell him and potentially face a negative reaction and have to no longer associate with him.
