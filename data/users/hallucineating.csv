RandomActsofCards,ffkyi67,t3_etye7a,1580031349.0,"I might be a stubborn cat person, but that doggy Christmas card is cute as all hell!

I am personally a massive rat convert. My cat-sitter has about ten and they are the most mischievous, excellent, squishy little bastards. My favourite is the one that always hides and I think I've lost him and nearly have a heart attack and then three hours later when I'm about to fall on a sword see him watching smugly from the bookshelf. I like 'em tricksy. So all the Year of the Rat cards I'm seeing are making me happy.

That's a lovely haul you've got!"

AskReddit,ffeppwu,t3_et84qz,1579859268.0,"I went to boarding schools here in the UK, and had started secondary at 13 in a school where the boys outnumbered the girls five to one. My roommate and I had a good natured 'war' going on and one day she hung my purple bra out the window with a sign above it with my name on. Needless to say the bra dropped and by the time we realised, it was long gone.

My mother's insistence at sewing nametags into all my clothing lead to my first interaction with the headmaster who had to ask why my underwear was found in the boys' dorms. My story sounded so stupid and made up I was convinced he wouldn't believe me, but I honestly think the whole conversation was too awkward for him so he gladly took the opportunity to give me the benefit of the doubt.

Of course, being 13, this was the most humiliating event of my life so far and I never retrieved the bra. 

An exaggerated and false version spread quickly but was soon forgotten after the headmaster's own daughter (in my year) was found sucking off some guy in the back of school transport and he had to suspend his own kid. Guess he became used to having awkward conversations after that."

AskReddit,ffep0xc,t3_et81g8,1579858218.0,"I became absolutely convinced when I was about seven that someone was going to break in and kill my family. So I would go to bed at bedtime, set my alarm for when I knew my parents would have gone to bed - about eleven - and then just crawl out and sit at the top of the stairs on the landing 'guarding' them until the sun started rising and my family started waking.

I have no idea what I thought I, a unarmed child, could have done if someone broke in with ill intent, and I was absolutely on edge with every noise I heard and constantly wound myself up into a state of fear where I'd sit there crying quietly with my heart racing. Anytime something had been lost or misplaced it alarmed me because to me it meant someone must have entered the house without me catching them and I needed to do better.

Needless to say I was barely sleeping, my grades slipped and I was always a second away from a meltdown. I became a very unhappy child.

I have no idea where it came from. There was nothing prominent in the news and I hadn't watched or overheard anything unsuitable. I don't remember how it resolved. However it's only in recent years I've found the same story repeated as happening around the same age amongst others that share my diagnosis of schizophrenia."

AskWomen,ffbg5gk,t3_esod02,1579763819.0,"This isn't about my gynaecologist, but a nurse practitioner taking my routine smear test. It's also more funny than horrifying.

Routine screening starts at 25 in the UK and, unless abnormalities are seen, are done every three years. I had had abnormalities on my first smear so I racked up more cervical inspections than most (it's all fine now) and therefore was completely comfortable in knowing what to expect from the experience by the time I turned 31.

So when the nurse practitioner was taking absolutely ages about it I started getting slightly uncomfortable and curious. She was re-angling lights as she stared into my fanny, trying a variety of different speculums. Eventually she called in a colleague and they whispered and prodded down by my spotlit genitals as I got more and more concerned until the original nurse stood up and quietly addressed me.

I was informed that my arse was too small to be creating the normal angle for investigating the cervix, and please would I ball my fists under my bum cheeks to create a clearer visual passage for them.

I meekly complied. But, I mean, I always knew I had the world's flattest arse, but now I had it medically confirmed just how insubstantial it was.

Another story concerns the gynaecologist that saw me when I was dealing with the aforementioned abnormalities. He was an eminent and respected man of his field and had been around long enough that my mother had been his patient before having children and for a while after. He had been around during her pregnancy with me, my birth a trimester early, and all the drama that accompanied it.

I have a bit of a problem with not thinking before I speak, so when I was leaving and he told me how much I looked like my mum, I couldn't stop myself from asking ""which end?""

To his credit, he just laughed and saw me out the door."
