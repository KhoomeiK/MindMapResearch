xxfitness,ffxzinj,t1_ffxqr4h,1580335519.0,"I think both can be true. Some women have an advantage with where they store their bf, so they don’t need to get any lower. But if you don’t have that, then lowering your bf by getting crazy lean is still the only thing you can do if you really want abs."

neoliberal,ffxujqb,t1_ffxrbiv,1580332701.0,I’ve always interpreted “ban cars” as the same tone as “eat the rich”. Not a literal suggestion just a hyperbolic statement said to express frustration with the thing.
ttcafterloss,ffxq7pg,t3_evonv8,1580330255.0,"Nah I've had an ectopic and I'd be exactly the same, so if anybody gives you shit just... I don't know, shake your head at them. But don't feel bad. Ectopics are another layer of shit on top of a miscarriage. I recall very distinctly thinking, ""Oh thank god, just a miscarriage!"" at one point during mine (though the doctors and I ended up being wrong about that in the end, I guess). I was happy, too. 

There's actually a sub for ectopics specifically, if you're interested: /r/ectopicsupportgroup. Not that this sub isn't great, but sometimes I feel like if folks haven't had an ectopic specifically, it's hard for them to relate."

fatlogic,ffw44ei,t1_ffw33zo,1580283484.0,"> I love baking tarts, cakes, cookies etcetera, and because of low budget I usually eat it for breakfast/lunch the following days (I almost never exercise btw).

I lived this diet for years in college. You aren’t eating as much as you think you are, especially if funds for food are an issue. You’re also Dutch and probably walk a lot more than many Americans, but even if you aren’t just not eating much is enough to keep you skinny. 

Weight gain/loss is pretty much solely determined by how many calories you’re eating, not how healthy you’re eating (though I’d recommend eating healthier for other reasons)."
fatlogic,ffw3lv8,t3_eviu1e,1580282845.0,"> How can being fat be SO bad that going through something so traumatic be worth it because they’re skInNy now. 

I mean, if you really cared, you were in the conversation and you could literally just actually ask that person this question about what’s improved so much about their life and how they feel now. I bet they’d be happy to tell you!"

StrongCurves,ffucbt3,t1_ffualu9,1580238977.0,"This is actually super helpful for me. I’ve been experimenting with going way past parallel which I’ve found I can definitely do, but it of course limits how much I can lift so I wasn’t sure it was worth it. But it sounds like it’s worthwhile!"

xxfitness,ffubt98,t1_fftqnom,1580238674.0,"I think I’ve read that home scales aren’t really trustable for your actual measurement but you can still use yours to see how you’re trending. 

I’ve also read that they can fluctuate a lot based on how hydrated you are or whatever but I don’t know about that, mine is always pretty close to the same."
xxfitness,ffublqx,t1_fftu8n2,1580238551.0,"FWIW my body fat tends to be highish even though I’ve got a BMI or like 21 and I’m in good shape and work out a lot. It’s because my diet is not great lol. I eat a lot of healthy things but don’t really hold back on the bad stuff either. I can “get away” with it in that I work out too much for it to cause me to gain weight but I can still see the effects, and it def shows up in my body fat measurements.

Conversely, you could totally be fine. All the various methods are estimations we all use to make the best guess about our health. The estimations work better for some people than others. Even a DEXA scan isn’t exact, I think only an autopsy would be perfect."
TTC30,ffu12r6,t1_fftkxen,1580232203.0,"My husband and I talk about my chart a lot, actually. It's still pretty hard for him to know when without me telling him explicitly though, honestly ultimately it's just not his body. Maybe it would be different if I had a regular cycle and it was easily predictable, but even then I'm not sure."
Sacramento,ffrvr3t,t1_ffrqvx2,1580166949.0,"I’d be surprised if it was, but maybe you attract people who can’t find permanent housing? Like I think month-to-month is an option on AirBnB, I did weekly arrangements when I first moved here years ago until I found more stable housing"
FAMnNFP,ffruhj2,t3_euqg2v,1580166104.0,"The rules should be about the same, though after my MC my cycles were/are craaaaazy long. So if you abstain entirely while you’re potentially fertile you might be abstaining for quite some time. And conversely if you’re using a barrier method you maybe want to use it all the time until things level out. 

Really though basically tracking worked exactly the same. Just the timeline was not what I was used to. When I get to a computer I can share my post-MC TTA chart if you’re interested."
TTC30,ffrtcth,t1_ffrpwi3,1580165389.0,"Lol it’s not actually very painful for me I played that save file before TTC (it was kind of an outlet because I knew I was in no place to try for real, but I could have a digital baby!!!) but it IS annoying — it was so easy!!!! 

plus I recall distinctly that I was worried I’d “lose” the pregnancy (you can literally lose it, through a glitch where a certain event trigger makes the program forget your character was pregnant) and it all seems quite quaint now."

TTC30,ffrmo12,t1_ffrgz5f,1580161208.0,"I’m getting back into it because I’ve figured out I can play it on my iPhone, share the same with my iPad and use a controller!! I’ve put in many hours on my computer as well. Though I have a baby in that save file and it kind of makes me mad now"
TTC30,ffrmhlx,t1_ffrh7i0,1580161101.0,"That all sounds like me... and I honestly think I have high progesterone if that’s a thing, my temp goes up quite a lot in the luteal phase, enough that I can both see it on my chart and feel it in my body at night, and my luteal phase is longish at around 14 days. 

I’d think about low progesterone if you have a short luteal phase, not much of a temp shift, and spotting for several days or more before your period. Those are the warning signs I’ve seen online anyway."
