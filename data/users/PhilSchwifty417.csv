magicTCG,fdpfdqs,t3_emk5bi,1578627196.0,Seems like orzhov auras might be a viable limited archetype?
magicTCG,fdostbq,t3_emhpb3,1578612085.0,I'm down for this. Pioneer and EDH are my two favorite formats and it would be interesting to see them mixed together.

Looking forward to using this in commander"

magicTCG,fckyx05,t3_ehr6vf,1577736174.0,Love the art for this. Not sure if aggro can use this in standard rn...
magicTCG,fckwa44,t3_ehqkq1,1577734565.0,I just made a Kestia commander deck this morning. Looking forward to adding this into it.
facepalm,fci6ls2,t1_fcgr50x,1577658352.0,"Couldn't agree more.
This post reminds me of that whole thing from last year where a girl wore a traditional chinese-inspired dress to prom. She posted some pics of it on twitter and some guy went off on her, claiming ""my culture is not your goddamn prom dress.""

To me, the entire concept of cultural appropriation is stupid. How is celebrating or paying homage to another culture offensive?"
PioneerMTG,fcglkh0,t1_fcgkzsd,1577641395.0,Got it. I'll keep an eye out for it.
PioneerMTG,fcgjhv2,t1_fcgis66,1577640828.0,Nice. Was that for a ptq or a preliminary?
PioneerMTG,fcgeamg,t1_fcg51em,1577639100.0,Cool! Do you mind sharing your decklist?

magicTCG,fcakf9i,t3_egvvsl,1577570936.0,"I'm really happy that Pioneer is taking off. As a guy who hates rotating formats but doesn't like modern, I look forward to playing it for years to come."

PioneerMTG,fc76jyw,t3_egkcgg,1577498888.0,Am I the only one intrigued by that Food Marvel deck?
EDH,fbv5z7o,t3_een3rs,1577126056.0,"I'm hoping to make a Kestia or Tuvasa deck when the set comes out, so I'm hoping for more enchantment creatures and I really want some viable sagas. Right now the only sagas I see going in are [[Mirari conjecture]] and [[mending of dominaria]]."
