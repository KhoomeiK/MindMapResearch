AskReddit,fc7gr4c,t1_fc7ghh2,1577506947.0,"Exactly. Plus it’s taxing on the body as well. Swimming is one of the sports that uses the most muscles in your body. It’s a workout. If you don’t do it for a sustained period, it feels like you haven’t done it for double the time. Don’t do it for a week? You get back in and it feels like you haven’t done it for two. Then again, the sport can be immensely rewarding in physical fitness, it’s a great way to lose weight and build general stamina, arm strength, leg strength, and lung capacity."
