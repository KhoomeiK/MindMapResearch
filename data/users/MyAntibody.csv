They set the entire movie up to search for them but all they needed was a ship that'd gone through it before and charted it. Also, whatever this thing is, it's supposed to be in space.  Shit moves around in space, and if I recall, it looked like there was movement of stuff in there as ships moved within it.

You might say well these things are explained elsewhere.  These are supposed to be the main Star Wars Saga movies.

My recollection is that the First Order should still be in existence, but planets are supposed to be rising up and defeating them somehow.  It’s lost Kylo and the lead Admiral who killed Hux, since he somehow made his way to the Sith planet.  Not sure how, don’t recall if they explained that.  Or explained how not one really seems to need that Pathfinder thingy except only when it’s convenient for the plot for the person to need the pathfinder thingy.  But I don’t think they sent the entire First Order fleet through.  Then again, we really have zero knowledge of the size and disposition of said fleet, so who knows."
