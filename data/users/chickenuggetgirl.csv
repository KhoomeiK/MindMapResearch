I donâ€™t know if this helps, but a couple of weeks ago I saw a private therapist and she doesnâ€™t send any correspondence to your doctors. So surely when they do their checks on your health they wouldnâ€™t find anything like that? It may be worth looking into as you need someone to talk to"

AskMen,fd96ix9,t3_ek99we,1578229197.0,"I canâ€™t remember us breaking the fart barrier but we have a few funny fart stories. On our second date we went to dinner and he drove me home, I got an overwhelming smell of shit in the car so I sat there nearly dying but didnâ€™t want to say anything, and he embarrassingly wound his window down a bit and said â€˜weâ€™re just driving past some fields so it might smell a bitâ€™ I just said â€˜okâ€™ to save him the embarrassment and tried my hardest not to laugh. 

A few weeks ago we were about to have sex, he was going on top so I was laying there ready, and just as he was about to go in, literally like a cm away from me, he let out the BIGGEST fart ever and he just stopped in his tracks and froze like a squirrel and then I just burst out laughing. He was so embarrassed bless him so we carried on but I couldnâ€™t stop laughing so he just rolled off mid way and we lay there laughing. 

We went on holiday to Wales once and stayed in a nice hotel (about 3 months into the relationship), we were in bed and he said he needed to fart so I kept telling him to but he didnâ€™t want to in front of me so he went into the en suite. I shit you not, he did one long loud fart that went on for about 45 seconds it wouldnâ€™t stop, so again, I was laughing my ass off and I could hear him laughing his ass off in the bathroom and were both just in separate rooms dying from laughing and him nearly shitting his pants"

houseplants,fd4jtts,t1_fd4j22v,1578168184.0,"Ahhhh. So I have a couple of planters that arenâ€™t in a pot with drainage, do I need to take them out occasionally and sit them in water or something? Iâ€™m useless with plants, Iâ€™ve only recently started getting them and looking into how to keep them alive so any advice is appreciated!"
houseplants,fd4fja7,t1_fd4bi3a,1578167072.0,"This may be a stupid question, but Iâ€™ve seen people say (and I also know) that planters like this need draining as youâ€™ve just mentioned above, but every plant pot Iâ€™ve bought including these ones, donâ€™t have any drainage in the bottom?

houseplants,fd47xby,t1_fd47mdd,1578165196.0,There was about 5 of these on the shelf and the others were all dead and dried to a crisp :( I can see how itâ€™s not suitable for a real plant as the space is tiny!! But the actually planters are quite big so they could have made them way bigger! I may have to get fake ones soon too
Doppleganger,fcywnnz,t3_ejjtx2,1578088710.0,I kinda get Jon Hamm vibes
Vent,fcyvwmf,t3_ejek70,1578088235.0,"Iâ€™m sorry you feel like this. Iâ€™ve been in this situation too. In fact only 3 or 4 weeks ago I sat in my bedroom in the dark and cried for 2 hours straight because I thought I was a bad person (I havenâ€™t done anything bad, I just feel like Iâ€™m constantly not doing enough and extremely self critical and always analyzing what Iâ€™m doing/saying).  It is ridiculously exhausting and draining. When I lived with my mum, probably when I was like 15-21, I was HORRIBLE. I screamed and cried and shouted at my mum constantly for no reason. Iâ€™d break my belongings and wreck my room like every other day, all because I was so angry and hated myself and my life so much. I hated anyone who seemed happy because I wasnâ€™t. I donâ€™t really have any advice for you, all I can say is that it does get better. I went to therapy for a few months which helped, I also moved out and got my own space which has been a huge help and now have an amazing relationship with my mum. I do still feel this way sometimes, but maybe only a handful times a year, whereas it was near enough every day. Please donâ€™t hurt yourself or do anything like that. Seek help, go to the doctors, talk to a therapist, work on your inner self. The fact you have addressed all of this proves you arenâ€™t a bad person and genuinely want to change which is awesome. Youâ€™ll get there just be gentle with yourself and give yourself the time to grow and change x"
Vent,fcytzit,t3_ejk4wp,1578087038.0,She is toxic and wants to see you fail and not be your best self because sheâ€™s probably jealous of you. Either have it out with her and tell her whatâ€™s up or cut her out of your life
Vent,fcyttpe,t3_ejkuqz,1578086939.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry, this is really sad to read. I donâ€™t really have any advice, but if you love your baby that much, please donâ€™t put her up for adoption. I feel you would regret it for the rest of your life. One of my best friends has a baby with her bf who is in the army. Heâ€™s away for months at a time and she pretty much raises her baby all on her own and she has done an amazing job. It will be hard, but when you look at your beautiful daughter it will all be worth it. And your boyfriend Iâ€™m sure will surprise you and be there a lot more than you think. If you need to talk or vent more please donâ€™t hesitate to message me x"

awfuleverything,fcnqjie,t3_ei4y32,1577816543.0,"Evil scum bags. This reminds me of a story my dad told me a few years ago. When we were living in Essex UK, there was a leisure centre not far from us and there was like a tunneled water slide which was half in side and looped out of the building (like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/kbLcXPLdB7fiwqRZ8)) and a bunch of c*nts stuck razor blades through the edges of the slide so when kids went down it theyâ€™d slash their legs. Not sure if this is true but I remember being so traumatized when he told me as I was super young and thought how is there such evil people in the world!"

MakeupLounge,fbxitc5,t3_eer29q,1577189579.0,I ordered a concealer of beauty bay a couple weeks back and the box was fucking HUGE filled with plastic shite in it and then there was just a tiny concealer buried under it all. I emailed them and told them itâ€™s so unnecessary for all that to be in there and that they should start thinking about making their packaging more environmentally friendly. I never heard back from them!

Skincare_Addiction,fbxi3rg,t3_eevpvo,1577188597.0,"Ohhhh I feel for you that looks so sore ðŸ˜ž I donâ€™t really have any advice I just wanted to send hugs. I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re using now, but if you are using a lot of tablets/washes/chemicals it could be worth maybe just taking a break from it all. Back in the summer my skin was really bad Iâ€™d have new break outs every single day for a couple of months and it was really getting to me, I was spending a fortune on different skin care trying everything I could. Then I just thought fuck it and stopped using everything I only washed my face in the shower with Mario Badescu acne soap, no moisturizer nothing, and honestly my skin started to clear up after a couple of weeks and now itâ€™s back to normal! I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve tried that or if that will work but itâ€™s worth trying I suppose if youâ€™ve tried everything else? Hope it gets better soon x"
