ClashOfClans,ff3b3m7,t1_ff2kdhp,1579537717.0,"Ok, so I got two things, one, I know someone who is looking to phish an account, with the help of an account phisher, then get the account banned. I‚Äôve tried contacting support but they don‚Äôt believe me. There‚Äôs a whole story behind it and it will take a while to explain but a (legends pb) th9 in one of the quantum‚Äôs clans, is at the risk of losing their account. (I‚Äôve asked my friend about it, took screenshots, sent them to support, and got told they wouldn‚Äôt do anything, then they blocked me from contacting them)


The other, I wasn‚Äôt able to send the proof to you beforehand, and it completely proves my innocence here. So is there a way I would be able to send this to you, and for you to forward it to the support specialist (I can‚Äôt get through in game or by email, whatsoever).
It would be hugely appreciated, as, I never shared the account, I never sold it, not did I buy it. But. As I explained before, it was phished, so the account shouldn‚Äôt even have been banned in the first place, but locked, and the person who phished it, should have been banned. 
I can prove this with the account data and with screenshots, along with access to my discord (the platform in which the account was phished), If needed.

I know it is a big ask, but it isn‚Äôt fair to be punished for the actions of someone else, and I don‚Äôt want 7 years of hard work to be for nothing."

As for the ban reversal, he is clearly innocent and they should at least look into the ban rather than tell him he broke the ToS, when he didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs also likely that he contacted from the same device as he played the town hall 7 on, and if not, it‚Äôs likely he was in the same country, if not, then supercell would have reason to ban him, but it‚Äôs still a pretty weak case on their half."
