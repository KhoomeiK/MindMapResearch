If all their using is a Roland Octopad it's basically just a large midi controller. Those things wouldn't be an issue."

I've found younger people tend to like Vinyl because of the large cover art, more so than the quality of the music."
movies,fewnrls,t1_few4ktb,1579416091.0,"It already kinda has. I used to browse the VHS section because occasionally you'd find some obscure shit that wasn't digitized, and you could get 20 for like $5. They're still cheap for the most part, but not as cheap as they used to be."

houston,felbhi8,t1_fel9yg8,1579218284.0,"Regardless, the main issue is still people aren't going to walk miles to get to the train station regardless of weather, and definitely not in Houston Summer heat. 

I've lived in places with really good public transport. Your map would need way more stops unless the city incorporated way more bus routes."

As far as monitors I'm just going to use an older one I have to get things going, and then look into upgrading in the future.

And yes, I do have a Microcenter. That's actually where I plan on buying everything. Before tax it's about $100 cheaper at Microcenter I think."
