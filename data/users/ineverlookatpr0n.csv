trashy,ffp2vkk,t1_ffp17sn,1580085127.0,I was thinking a torn-up pillow case.
trashy,ffp2tkk,t1_ffoyn9a,1580085089.0,Both trashy behaviour and smoking cigarettes are signs of poverty and lacking the privilege of a good upbringing to teach them why such behaviour is bad in the first place.
trashy,ffp2nt0,t1_ffoy96t,1580084975.0,"They don't need to be doing anything ""wrong"" if they're white trash, but I agree this is pretty harmless."
gonewild30plus,ffol3ao,t3_eud2tv,1580078798.0,So... I guess you actually want 3 things.

adorableporn,ffkdjpz,t3_eu2ej1,1580021000.0,Apparently three words cuddling or fantasy are banned now?  What the actual fuck?
adorableporn,ffkdgw0,t3_eu2ej1,1580020966.0,Cuddling you up all night would be a huge fantasy for me.
Celebhub,ffkcl74,t3_eu2c6d,1580020556.0,I guess I was?  What is this from?
PetiteGoneWild,ffkcdab,t3_eu2a3j,1580020457.0,"Why not both?

Also—that outlet is a disaster.  You really should invest in a power strip!"
todayilearned,ffkc3dm,t1_ffk1zug,1580020330.0,"No, we absolutely don't need to accept that.  If we didn't pay the .00000001% (and their record companies) so much, there would be a hell of a lot more to go around to all the others.  There is absolutely no reason a ""musician"" needs to make even $1 million/year.  That is absurd.  But at the same time, legitimate ones (not garage bands) shouldn't be struggling simply to make ends meet."
todayilearned,ffkbpnq,t1_ffk7ztn,1580020160.0,"Pretty sure Ticketmaster has no control over prices whatsoever.  The fees are certainly exorbitant, and venues need to stop contracting with them.  The service they provide is trivially easy for anyone to do in the internet age."
todayilearned,ffkbj47,t1_ffk6fwf,1580020075.0,"Good.  Now it is finally as it should be.  People should be paid for time spent actually working, not working once and then paid forever while sitting around doing nothing."
todayilearned,ffkbdtv,t1_ffk1axb,1580020008.0,"The ""better way for them to make money"" is to actually WORK, just like the rest of us.  They should make the majority of their money from actually performing, and they should be expected to perform a hell of a lot more.  There's no reason some shitty rock or pop star should be earning millions of dollars each year.

The issue is that record companies shouldn't be either.  We need to eliminate that.  Record companies provide a service.  ""Artists"" should be hiring record companies to perform that service and paying them a fixed rate, just like any other service provider, and keeping *all* the rest of those earnings, as well as retaining the rights to the music and recordings.

The entertainment fake-music industry is a joke."
todayilearned,ffkaath,t1_ffjy3j8,1580019519.0,You say that like it's a bad thing...
todayilearned,ffka7mc,t1_ffjxb3c,1580019482.0,"No, the issue is not Sony—they are doing what they are required to do under capitalism.  The issue is capitalism and an entertainment industry fuelled by profits.  Not to mention ""artists"" who eagerly choose to sign with these giant corporations."
todayilearned,ffk9z69,t1_ffjg2ix,1580019374.0,"Who cares?  It's not like the streaming companies dictate the terms to the ""artists""—they sign a contract at a certain rate.  It's entirely voluntary.

""Artists"" should be grateful they're getting anything when we can just download anything we want at any time.  It's basically a donation."
todayilearned,ffk9ohv,t3_etytlb,1580019241.0,Does that mean songwriter royalties are separate from performance royalties?

gonewild30plus,ffemtum,t1_ffel29g,1579854948.0,But why?  Is it a hotel for spring breakers?  That actually sounds a little trashy.  Hope it adds to your birthday happiness.
PetiteGoneWild,ffemnlv,t3_et6xcs,1579854699.0,You look incredible.

trashy,ff8by21,t1_ff774hl,1579672335.0,"I've never understood how auto dealers make to bamboozle people into signing leases.  Every single thing you read tells you it's an extremely bad financial move, yet any time you accidentally watch broadcast TV, you see lease offers on all the car commercials.

How did they get you to do it?"
trashy,ff8bktm,t1_ff822jx,1579671962.0,"People don't get car loans in NZ?  What?  How is that possible?  And why?  People really take out thousands in cash?

While buying outright is certainly preferable, there's nothing wrong with financing as long as the term is short (2-3 years) and interest rate reasonable (5% or less).  *Very* few people in the US can afford to buy a car outright, sadly.  The average savings of a US American is $400.  Seriously.  We're *terrible* with money."

trashy,ff8b91m,t1_ff7gadz,1579671640.0,No?  You were the idiot who chose that loan and such an expensive vehicle.  You deserve no compassion for a situation you brought in yourself.
trashy,ff8b58x,t1_ff76spq,1579671537.0,"I get so shocked when I hear some people talk about huge car payments like they're just a given.  An accepted expense everyone has all the time, like paying for food or rent it something!  It's absolutely insane.  One should only have a car payment for a few years, tops.  Cars last over a decade quite easily these days."
trashy,ff8axwt,t1_ff6ywhl,1579671340.0,"It depends on the country, obviously.  Doubt it would be legal in the civilized world.  Obviously the US is a different matter.  Way too many people just answering ""yes"" without determining this crucial piece of information."

trashy,ff893gh,t3_es645r,1579669611.0,"And you are somehow familiar with the nature of the private relationship between her and her husband?  How, pray tell, have you learned this information?  You people are automatically assume everyone is 100% monogamous and thus cheating any time they have sex with anyone besides their spouse are so fucking pathetic.  It's the 21st century.  Get over your outdated notions!

If there is any legitimate evidence that this couple had made a commitment to each other not to sleep with anyone else, then by all means shame away.  But otherwise get the fuck out with this shit."

I'm incredibly bored at any kind of action sequences in films, any kind of sport I'm not participating in, most social interactions, etc.  I know I suffer from depression, but never would have thought to associate it with that kind of boredom specifically.
