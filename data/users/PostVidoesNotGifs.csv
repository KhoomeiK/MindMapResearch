This means they do not require a note from their doctor if its less than 7 days. However they need to sign a form when they return to work to say why they were sick.

These should be kept in their HR file and the employer should raise concerns to them if they are sick too often or have a recurring illness. To put in place measures to help them.

Essentially the opposite of what you expect it would do.

(after all, how would an animal know what it's feeling is natural? And in the case of cats they are incredibly capable of remaining stable in flight, but tablets will make them less sure-footed and could fall and be injured. They could also be sick).

I also personally think its not only incredibly disrespectful to the other passengers to bring an animal into the cabin, it's disrespectful to the animal.

brexit,ffgnanu,t1_ffgiazn,1579910221.0,"The way you misunderstood the rule is this:

Under the MFN rule you're able to treat some countries less favourably if its to protect yourself from 'unfair competition' or safety & food regs.

This exception can and has been used improperly, but it's also in use correctly by most developed countries in one way or another.

One example is the WTO upholding the US tariffs on China. Another is the EUs 13% tariff on Australian and New Zealand meat, or South African wines. 

You can also impose sanctions, but that's a whole other story and not part of this. :) 

You're also allowed to treat developing nations more favourably than your most favoured nation rules without being required to offer those terms to developed nations. 

So although in theory yes, you're supposed to trade with eveyone on MFN terms if you don't have an FTA, you are allowed to tariff goods from nations that are more competitive than you. And you're allowed to be friendlier to developing nations.

But two developed nations that sell goods you don't make yourself, you have to treat them equally and buy from them under your MFN terms."

Or 4.

Somewhere inbetween no doubt.

That said, the official number of confirmed cases has risen by 300 in 2 days, and the number of quarantined cities has increased from 1 to 13 in the same time period.

Which leads one to suspect it it more widespread than they are currently aware of or reporting.

But his 70k figure is not being reported by anyone reputable. The current figure of 830 within China. Though there are reports of long waits for a diagnoses, so likely that number will rise.

But let's not all jump to doomsday scenarios just yet :)

Edit: Since I wrote this 3 hours ago it has gone up by another 500, and another 20 deaths. The confirmed cases are of course mostly people who have had it a while but only just now confirmed.

It's said each person is infecting between 1.4-2.5 other people, anything over 1 is considered sulf sustaining and won't burn itself out on its own. This is the same rate as SARS which is in the same family of viruses."

brexit,ffggmbr,t1_ffgd07z,1579905783.0,"That headline is actually a lot more accurate. But surely you're capable of understanding the difference in the headlines '52% back remain' and '52% back second Referendum', those are two very very different things and one is clearly intentionally misleading.

Especially since many leave voters (especially Labour supporting leave voters) supported a second Referendum in order to stop the arguing and confirm the leave intention again.

I don't need to own my vote, since I didn't vote.

I'm just an economics graduate in his early 30s who lives in Spain and is politically centrist and in a relationship with a leftist Greek politics graduate. You've made some wrong assumptions. :) 

I didn't bother to vote in the general election as it was already clear the conservatives would win, and honestly its a bit of a hassle to do from here. Though winning by quite so much was a bit surprising.

You can call anyone you want fanatical, but it doesn't mean much when you've started off by saying there aren't many leave supporters, which you know is insane to suggest.

It doesn't matter how rigged you believe it is, it doesn't change the fact that there are a significant amount of leave supporters, even if you believe there are currently more remain supporters it doesn't negate there are clearly a lot of leave supporters and you were simply wrong to suggest otherwise.

I also don't see why you believe the FPTP system is crooked? Yes in the USA they have gerrymeandering which is a major issue. But in the UK the districts are arranged by an independent politically neutral body.

Yes its not perfect, but no system is perfect, and others can lead to more of the kind of deadlocks we've been plagued with for the past year. Sometimes it's simply better to have one party in control, even if it's not the one you agree with.

What do you do in an RP situation when you support one party, you end up putting the one you think will get the least support as the second choice. This just artificially inflates the size of the parties nobody wants. That's why lib Dem supporters want it, because both Conservative and Labour supporters would vote for them before the other major party, even though neither side actually wants lib dems to have any power."
brexit,ffgaivt,t1_ffg8xjm,1579901988.0,"The point of discounting labour is that they are a leave party.

But to give you the benefit of the doubt, if you remove Labour since let's say their policies were... Fluid. Then that leaves you with only the fully leave and fully remain parties. Of which there is a clear winner.

Also that headline is hilariously poorly written. I hope you read the next sentence. The article doesn't prove your point at all.

Don't forget there was the well advertised remain coalition, so all voters knew that a vote for a remain party wasn't a wasted vote as all remain parties would band together.

Still didnt give any of them a good turnout."

brexit,ffg7ved,t1_ffg6q9z,1579900356.0,"So what does that have to do with Brexit?

You can't argue there isn't support for it when the two parties who support it got 85% of the vote, and the party who had the strongest plan for it got the most votes, and the largest majority since Thatcher.

And the most outspoken MP, the leader of the Lib Dems, and the only person fully supporting remaining in the EU, lost her seat and her party.

None of this indicates there isnt strong support for it, and more importantly support to have one direction and an end to the gridlocks that just delay the inevitable.

If you want to take labour out of the equation for some reason, then you end up with approx 25% for remain partes and 75% for leave parties."

The SNP only won 45% of the vote, but won 48/58 seats. But I don't see anyone complaining about that.

Remain parties DID NOT have the majority of the vote. Labour is NOT a remain party. It was a delay leaving but ultimately leave party. The actual remain parties did terribly."

But that misunderstanding aside, there are allowances for allowing greater access to the market for developing countries which doesn't trigger the most favoured nation rule for everyone else.

But of course most developing nations have free access to the EU, in no small part due to the UK, Cyprus and Malta pushing it.

However they do put high tariffs on a lot of countries the UK historically trades with and would prefer to trade with, who have superior products than are available in the EU."
