Moral of the story, no matter where I put her, she is in peril and then I’m like “Ohp, well the floor isn’t safe so let me move you to the couch. Ohp, nope, you’re set on climbing over the back and falling. Well I’ll just hold you on my lap for now.” Baby wines and arches her back and slides out of my grip like an oily fish and plops back on the floor. Repeat. For 3 years."

AskAnAmerican,fegrenq,t1_feg2uup,1579100773.0,"I have a family member in prison and this is accurate for him. He spent nearly three decades in max security then was recently moved to medium security, which is so much more lax. Being moved was still a traumatic experience for him which he wouldn’t talk about. 

While awaiting his trial, they put him on suicide watch, which consisted of him being locked in a closet naked with a window. We don’t know much more about that because he can’t bring himself to talk about it.

He originally had access to education and took advantage of it but it was completely cut and our community was happy about it. They’ve slowly been stripping away access to his family for convenience and profiting from it. 

When he gets out, he will be a completely traumatized man and we fear he won’t live a full life span due to stress, poor nutrition, and poor health care."

I asked him why and he keeps acting like it’s some practical thing for a green card and other bullshit but that’s definitely not the main reason. I wish that it was. He keeps going back to that as his excuse. It’s a fact that they’re sleeping together and in love. Makes me fucking sick."

AskAnAmerican,feg0k2l,t3_eoyvbr,1579071797.0,"What you’re describing absolutely un-fucking heard of to me. In prison you sleep in a tiny cell with a toilet, eat sad shitty food, live in fear of gangs, have letters from your 85 year old mother thrown away because they were written on yellow paper instead of white, have all opportunities for education stripped from you, have to sit 5 feet away from your family when they visit you, and much much more. The purpose of prison here is to strip you of your humanity, torment you for years, then throw you out on the street. 

It’s very very common to hear people say shit like “My tax dollars are going toward education/keeping them alive/anything remotely positive for criminals?? How awful!!” 

Americans generally have a huge boner for locking people up and the thought of prisoners suffering. It is so weird. At least where I’m from."
