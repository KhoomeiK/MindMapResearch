I always thought that kiwifruit just reacted weird with my lips, but as I got older I started to get the same feeling with pineapple. Now it happens with apricots. It basically feels like a rash in my mouth, or like I ate too much Cap'n Crunch and ruined my mouth.

I'm curious to know if your technique would work with this? I don't want to develop more allergies, but I'm worried that I will with the growing number of fruit and seasonal allergies I've been experiencing..."

I follow a woman on Instagram who posts ways to do gym workouts with home items (including using her couch for leg presses).

Honestly, you reap the benefits of exercise by *walking* around 30 minutes total a day. Doesn't have to be consistent, you just have to walk that total amount. As someone with Bipolar II (more depressive state) and general anxiety disorder walking is my exercise of choice, with home yoga and physical therapy exercises (for a herniated disc) being my current ""extreme"" exercises.

Edit: I should clarify that this doesn't cure me, but it helps. I'm on both antipsychotics and anxiety meds still, absolutely need my medication. I also have iron, folate, and vitamin d deficiencies, which I take vitamins daily for. These also help with depression symptoms."

Remember to scoop and swoop the girls in, it really helps! If you still feel that you are having issues with the size, you can post up pictures of how it fits to see if it's correct. Obviously only if you're comfortable doing that. But I have seen it help out other women who weren't sure of the fit."
ABraThatFits,fd5shqr,t3_ek40nx,1578180997.0,"The band size the calculator gave you looks accurate. You're likely not used to the tightness, but when you have a bra that properly fits the tightness should be hardly noticeable. If you feel it's still too tight, try a 34, not a 36. When you go up in band, you have to change the cup size, too. A common misconception is that bra cups are all the same size with different band sizes. That's wrong, the cup letter just denotes the inches difference between the underbust and bust. 32 underbust with a 39 bust, 7 inch difference means G cup (or around there). If you went to a 36 band but kept the G, that'd be a cup size way too big for you. (edit: I misspoke and said too small at first. Oops.) 

The last time you were measured, was it with a similar calculator or a store employee? Most stores don't size properly and will size you to fit their bras rather than what you should have. Sticker shock is common when you get a proper sizing. I'm personally a 38H, but you honestly wouldn't think so looking at me. This sub changed my LIFE with proper sizing, I hope it helps you find your perfect bra, too."
