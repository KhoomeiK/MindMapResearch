I appreciate your commentary on what you think Denver should do with its housing crisis, but frankly disagree because of my experience in my own city. Hopefully Denver is open to trying a multitude of housing models, and not continuing what is clearly a failing model according to your reports. As I mentioned elsewhere on this thread, the population and dynamics of the homeless in Denver will look different due to medical bills and the safety net available to them which are different than Canada's. 

The agency I work for houses people in bachelor or 1 bedroom walk up apartments for about $750-900/month. Your housing board may need a subsidy program for that to be a reality. The scenario I am talking about is not ""comfortable"" without some support, but it's doable. We're both trying to make life better for a lot of people, and I suspect a hybrid approach will be what most places settle on. But please do give market solo housing a chance, as it might surprise you. It surprised my city in a very very good way. :)"

You're super right about.... the straight up fragility of people's situations? So many folks are one layoff, illness, car accident, breakup away from serious housing instability. 

I think the dynamic/population of homelessness would be different in the States than here in Canada because of big medical bills, and the availability of social safety nets, but I also had that same realization when I started my job. Many homeless people are pretty ""normal"" day to day or in person; whereas society always makes us think of a homeless person on the street as some ""filthy crazy person"" yelling things.

Do you think you would feel safe taking kitchen space and negotiating with people with possibly conflicting addiction/sobriety goals, kids, partners, etc.?

Of course there are long waits for motels, because they're not shelters. That's not really relevant, but just tells you that the status quo is more broken than we realize. 

I'm a wholehearted advocate for Housing First, because research tells us that it is the housing strategy that has the highest success rate (80%) with the lowest cost compared to sleeping on the streets (3-4x the cost to governments vs. housing first) or transitional housing (10x the cost of housing first). 

It connects participants to community and also the available resources to them.

Transitional housing (which is what you're talking about with a bunch of rules and security) costs about 10 times what Housing First does, and has about 1/4 the success rate over 3 years. 

In addition, people hate it. Super capable people hate all the rules that transitional housing imposes, and people who NEED the rules never leave this situation, when in reality they need something closer to permanent supportive housing, which is much more involved (includes things like harm reduction, community supports, homecare, etc.). 

What you're talking about just has been tried time and time again, and isn't a good fit for the VAST majority of people, even though I agree that it sounds like a super good idea on paper!"

If you put a lot of people who likely have substance issues, mental health issues, past abuse issues, gang affiliation, physical health issues, etc. in the same place, you're going to encounter issues. 

Doors left open, people squatting (often friends and family, substance-motivated behaviour (theft, paranoia, lack of cleanliness, keys lost, violence, MANY police calls) 

I am of course, not saying that this is guaranteed to happen. But buildings that get saturated with populations like this can get messy FAST (just speaking from experience working in housing for a social service organization, not trying to make generalizations about ""putting poor people together""). I've seen it happen in apartment buildings, not just shelters."

Not that that makes me a psychiatrist/psychologist by any means! I just have a lot of perspective from both my education and time working with my city's vulnerable population. 

I'm not saying employment is a bad goal for people without houses. But I am saying that it's hard to be a good worker when you have to worry about where your next meal is coming from, how you're staying warm after work, if all your stuff is safe, etc. 

If a mental health professional suggests that structure is important to a client, then sure. But I just don't buy that just going up to someone with Borderline and being like, ""hey buddy! Pick up a shovel!"" will actually help treat anyone's mental illness. 

There are just so many better ways and steps before that for someone whose homelessness was likely caused in part by their illness.

I totally agree - one bad luck incident could put many people over the edge. Lots of participants I work with have been in car accidents, and that really strikes me. One wrong turn by someone, and you're permanently disabled, maybe have PTSD, etc. 

The other thing that shocked me when I started in housing (even as someone who considered themselves generally socially aware) was the proportion of indigenous folks. We work with probably 80% indigenous people, who have experienced generational trauma and abuse. It's a hard place to start one's success story without some help."

UpliftingNews,femb15n,t1_femad2s,1579246670.0,"Many people who are living on the streets, are what we refer to as Heavy Users of Service (HUoS). Every time someone calls the cops for ""the bums fighting on the street"" or ""someone passed out in a snow bank"" costs taxpayer money; every ER visit, every ambulance call, every crisis line phoned, etc, and that doesn't include the cost of any government grants that go to social services that they access.  HUoS can cost up to 100 thousand dollars per year in responses and services, as they're interacting with police sometimes multiple times per day. 

So, help someone get a cheap apartment (even pay their damage deposit and a month of rent) help them connect to income support services and community/professional supports, assign them a caseworker for a year of skill development and support, that costs us about 30k all in. 

I actually work in housing first in canada. It's insanely effective. The saying goes: homelessness isn't ONLY a housing problem, but it's ALWAYS a housing problem. Address the common denominator, then work on the rest. Living in survival mode isn't conducive to turning ones life around.
