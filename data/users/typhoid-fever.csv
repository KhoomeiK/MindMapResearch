the exceptional sophistication of our ability to shape and influence our environment casts an illusion through our arrogance that humans are above nature even though it is nature itself which shaped us into this form, it is nature which we still find ourselves within, and it is nature which we depend on for sustenance so to destroy nature would also be to destroy ourselves.this dependency on nature reveals that our distinctive path of development does not make us superior or entitled, only that it allows us an opportunity not afforded to others in nature, to be its curator and its cultivator, not its master and its lord as arrogance demands. it is of inherent responsibility to protect and revitalize nature using our natural abilities because we are the only ones known to ourselves who have evolved in nature capable of fulfilling this purpose . it is of our own best self interest to assume this role because it is not fuels or metals that is our most vital resource but the distinctive biological and environmental diversity within nature that can be found on this planet and nowhere else."

AskReddit,ffjmbx4,t3_ett7fr,1580001555.0,"my whole life i never did much more than sit in my room and keep to myself and never ask anyone for anything i dropped out of school so it would reduce conflict at home it ws easier than dealing with other people in my life and when i made money i did it in secret so  my family couldnt stop me while my brother felt incredibly entitled to everything and my dad let him bleed him dry never had money or time to help me get the tools i need to move on with my life but my dad involuntarily committed me one day  bc im a danger to myself for not cleaning my room cause thats the only thing he seemed to care about emotion wise so i wouldnt do it  caused he hurt me really bad emotionally one day and it destroyed what little confidence i had left in myself and i got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and he told my brother that hes done with him its all about helping me now and that sent me down a path of getting disability just by signing a paper with some lady from some program that helps me do shit which made my brother really jealous cause he always thought i had it better than him because i wasnt allowed to do anything growing up while he got help to escape lol and now im the one gettin help and he gets no help so hes always spying on me and stealing my moneythen he hit a horse that was laying across the road in the head and it fucked his car up so he cant drive anymore but my mom finally got me a shitty car and my dad took me to get my license like they did for him around 18 years ago and i never let him drive it so naturally he hates me i always wake up with marks across my belly and skin picked off tops of my feet and on my achilles heel and bottom of my thumbs when hes around i kept his ass awake when he oded so he would keep breathing the only respect i seem to got from him is some story about how to tell if someones asleep and how best to hurt them without anyone knowing he said you take your iphone turn the light on where the screens all white and u put it in one eye and then wait a minute and do it to the other eye and you check you wait and do it again and check until you see the eyes roll into th eback of their head and roll around then he said our brain has a sleep cycle and it cycles through different modes of sleep and in one of them it makes you paralysed and nothing can wake you and the sleep cycle is modulated on each side so when you check for the rem like that you can influence the next cycle and his wife is a light sleeper after that he told me if you really wanna hurt someone without anyone knowing you check their sleep cycle and then after you pinch the skin off in the best places you lift their shirt to expose their belly and put the cap end of a bottle against them with one hand with all your strength and then pull the bottle with the other hand to scrape it he said it looks like scratches and that his wife gets scratches and marks a lot at work then he told me if you really wanna kill someone you take the water bottle up against their head and hit the bottle with a hammer it distributes pressure so it doesnt break the skin all the damage is internal then he said if you really really wanna kill someone you put maggots in their ears now i didnt know if he told me this because he really did those things to her or if its bc he wanted to know if i knew but i just had to find out if he was really doing it a few weeks later i kept the lights on and tried not to fall asleep and when he talked to me i ignored him and i saw the lights flash in my eyes and him lift my shirt over my belly and when he scraped it i jumped up bc i didnt go into rem and his eyes got huge and he fell on his ass and i ran to the back of my room and asked him what he was doing and he gave me some bullshit flattery like i was just seeing if you were awake so i could tell you how much i love you and how proud i am of you which i dont believe for a second he really hurt me and when he went home i checked his room and i found a empty newport pack with some maggots in it he got into the same program as me that helps me with my mental health he said he wants to game the system i kept telling my dad i didnt feel safe around him and to stop bringing him around i tried so hard to tell him without sounding crrazy  but he wouldnt listen i tried so hard to get ahold of his wife but i couldnt get her to answer the only number i could get was from my brother i needed to know if she ever suspected or noticed eventually she kicked him out for reasons i dnt know and my dad let him live with us sometimes id put a cane up against my door so i would know if he was coming in bc it would either slide up the door or dunder the bed and if you tried to put it back in place you couldnt get out and every night either i heard him say my name 3 times then he says  you know i can still get in their right then hed open the door and id have to grab it and push it shut i heard him drop  a water bottle the one time and sometimes id hear him go into my dads room when he couldnt get into mine nce i waited in the bathroom for him to come out and he did but i dont know what hes doing in there my dad said his gut pain is from the cancer but the last night he hurt me  i confronted him  that day for being so callous and entitled towards me during the day as if im supposed to take care of this evil motherfucker for the rest of his life now that im on disability while hurting me at night and he said he was gonna kill me and i know he killed a guy before when he lived in buffalo over 1,000$ for pot he didnt get over a decade ago anyway the cane was not put back in place and i was hurting sooo o fucking bad it woke me up and all i could do was roll over on my side felt like he shoved his finger deep in my right ear and i had a long long scratch on my right side  felt like someone beat me in the head my dad wouldnt believe me said it was from leaning on the counter even tho it was the wrong angle i straight up begged him he wouldnt listen i had to do something i hoped my dad would  turn on me for my brother and my brother would stop hurting me and he made me commit myself again better in there than at home and he told them it was impossible what i was saying so they treated me like i was talking about a james bond villian so noone believes me or will investigate fully despite the marks that my guts still hurt to this day and so does my ear i got ahold of his wife finally while i was in there and she said her marks wre from work not my brother lol and shes a light sleeper so shed know he hasnt punched her since 2010 she said now im staying at my moms but shes a very controlling and criticizing perfectionist that lives in a house full of toxic mold so im going to be going to a homeless shelter soon, the place my dad should have made my brother go or at least a fucking mental hospital so he can get some damn help to satiate his sociopathic rage some other way"
