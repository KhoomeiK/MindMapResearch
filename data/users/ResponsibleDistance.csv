GenderCritical,fej7ny2,t1_fej71mf,1579160357.0,"Or maybe you got ""out of academia"" because you write like a 12 year old. Is that it?"
GenderCritical,fej7jfd,t1_fej71mf,1579160201.0,"If you knew anything about academia, sweetie, you'd know that...a thesis can cross disciplines. In my case, I did a Marxist/frankfurt school reading of the novels of one author. I had a sociologist, a philosopher, and an English Lit professor as my supervisors. If I thought you had any valid interest in it I'd send it to you. My MA is a radfem reading of one novel. I had a sociology and an English lit supervisor for that. So yes, of course, it changes depending on what I am discussing. Of course it does. 

I'm guessing you ""got out of academia"" after your first degree, amirite? That's why you throw around stuff that you can learn with a google search of ""logical fallacies"" (and then commit all the fallacies yourself when you are 'arguing')."
GenderCritical,fej6x29,t1_fej6jom,1579159417.0,And sweetie? Stop using capital letters. It's annoying.
GenderCritical,fej6uu8,t1_fej6jom,1579159339.0,"I don't just have an MA - I have a PhD. Don't worry, my PhD isn't on radical feminism. It's actually a Marxist PhD (I saw you lecturing someone about that just before :') ).

And in academia, we don't go on about ad hominems. I have literally never heard that phrase come up within the walls of any of the universities I have attended/ taught at by anyone other than a first year student. Where I do see it is on reddit where, yeah, anyone can pretend to know anything about anything because they have read a few books.  

You've shown your true colours though."
GenderCritical,fej67mh,t1_fej5o34,1579158546.0,"> If you're OP your post was regurgitating republican talking points. If you want to debate ideas, go for it. Tell me about all the women who just flippantly go through late term abortions for the hell of it. Or the women who go for abortions on their lunch and how it's soooooo fashionable.

It's just bizarre that you are saying this to me. I'm not the OP and I never mentioned these things."
GenderCritical,fej649z,t1_fej5o34,1579158432.0,"I'm not the OP, and I didn't agree with the OP! I thought they raised interesting points that we could talk about. 

I did radfem philosophy for my MA thesis, thanks for educating me though :') Clearly I got the wrong end of the stick! All the real-life radical feminists I know are capable of discussing even the most fundamental aspects of radical feminism. Without this ability, it becomes just pure ideology - which is basically what I'm witnessing here. You're either in or out, with us or against us - no discussing the Party line.

Look at your language and how you're talking to another woman. You may as well just add a 'sweetie' or a 'hun' in there and be done with it.

GenderCritical,fej5dyl,t1_fej4qbd,1579157571.0,"I'm talking about all the many assumptions you've made, the caps, the overall tone. I just had a look at your other comments and you have done it to other people too. Is that solidarity? Because someone is unsure about one thing they get paragraphs of lecturing? I asked for people's thoughts, true, but you leave no room at all for discussion of any kind of nuance - which is one of my main problems, as outlined by my first comment. This is what turned me away from wokeness on the Left, but it is evident right here. It is probably an internet thing, but I still think it is completely counter productive. 

You have no idea who I am, you don't know what I've read, you don't know whether or how I get my ideas challenged, you don't know how my ideas have been tested or how I've formed them. You don't know what I know about radical feminism or why I came here to this sub. You seem to deliberately misconstrue what I've said, because you don't like it, as when you write: ""I told you that the policy is there to protect women. If you don't like that, I don't know what to tell you."" 

It's your prerogative to see allies as enemies - or, more accurately here, as somehow inferior in understanding to yourself - but don't be surprised when they feel alienated."
GenderCritical,fej48k6,t1_fej3ux9,1579156299.0,"No, it isn't that. It's that people like you force out those of us who are unsure and still forming our ideas about things. You are a hypocrite who has a grand idea about women in general but shouts down individual women who are just trying to gather and process their thoughts."
GenderCritical,fej3t2o,t1_fej3cdn,1579155843.0,"Well, I think we will have to agree to disagree. As I said in my original comment, while I understand that for some people these issues are completely obvious and simple they are not obvious and simple for me.  In fact, I have become more unsure about them as time has gone on, not more sure.  

Anyway, this whole thread has made me realise that engaging with this sub is not for me."
GenderCritical,fej33w1,t1_feixmef,1579155094.0,I agree with you - but recently 24 week abortion for any reason has been legalised where I am. That's what I'm talking about in my original comment.

GenderCritical,feikncl,t1_feib29o,1579140743.0,"I'm jumping in to defend the OP here - I am someone who is pro-choice, has had an abortion, and is probably from a different country to the OP, and I have definitely seen that kind of attitude with my own eyes - from 'woke' people in my city."
GenderCritical,feik882,t1_fei1srl,1579140458.0,">The fact that the issue is discussed in such a black and white manner in order for us to maintain our rights really sucks.

This describes how I feel exactly."
GenderCritical,feik2r1,t3_ep9qdc,1579140354.0,"I hope it's possible because that describes my stance (pro-choice but don't see it as meaningless). For the record, I'm an atheist and have had an abortion myself.

I'm also really...troubled...by later term abortions for reasons other than health of the baby/mother. My country just extended the time frame for legal abortion and I'm unsettled by it.  I know it's really hard to draw a line in the sand and say 'it's wrong from here' but actually I think it needs to be done, and for me 24 weeks is too late.

I also see, in some 'woke' circles (mainly twitter to be fair) an undermining of any real discussion on abortion. Like it is a crystal clear issue that is not up for discussion, akin to climate change or vaccination. But it isn't - there are ethical questions that remain for me, even though I am pro-choice. It is like the Party line is that is is Good, and questioning that is Bad.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?"
AskWomenOver30,feiiwwl,t3_epano2,1579139581.0,"Grateful. I always think about all the billions of alternative lives I could have had, either now or throughout history. Vast numbers of people lived and do live terrible, difficult lives. I'm human - I suffer. But overall I am so incredibly lucky to have been born me, in my situation. Whenever I feel bad I just list all the things I'm grateful for, such as ""not having to worry about where my next meal is coming from"" and ""living in a peaceful country"". It makes me feel incredibly lucky really quickly."

AskWomenOver30,fdny7by,t1_fdnjn2c,1578595257.0,"I completely agree with this. On almost every relationship post, even if the relationship is clearly toxic and dysfunctional, people are like ""communicate more!"" People end up staying and talking about their terrible relationship instead of leaving. 

One of my friends got married a year ago and before the wedding she was considering calling it off because he is an alcoholic. She went through with it and in their vows they talked about their 'great communication'. That communication is now obscuring a really unhappy marriage. I also 'communicated' a lot in my former, miserable, 5 year relationship - we just weren't compatible (he wanted an open relationship and we communicated a lot about that!)

My husband and I are incredibly compatible and we don't need to do all this talking and communicating. We just get along. 

I'm not saying 'don't talk' but I think if you're having lots of long talks about your relationship it may be because there are deeper problems."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdnwppu,t1_fdlyqci,1578594388.0,"Ok, fair enough. It's just that the world record is 2:11. You guys must have been super competitive!!

insanepeoplefacebook,fdlxg41,t1_fdlwtoi,1578534817.0,"Are you trolling? I'm sorry but you're wrong, the average runner does NOT do a 3 minute 1 km. I'm an average-good runner, I run at the gym, I run in groups with other people, and most people do not do one km in 3 minutes - and yes, I am talking about just running 1 km, not the average pace across time. In fact, I don't think I know any 'average runner' who has ever done a 3 min km. Most of the runners I know do about 4:00 when they are going really hard.

If people had read my other comments, they'd see that I actually track my calories and aim for 1700 a day. I also go to the gym 4 or 5 times a week and walk my dogs every day. Interestingly, another comment I made on this very post has like 30 upvotes. I think people are a bit quick to downvote anyone they think someone might think a little bit differently from them - for me, intuitive eating means eating mainly fruit, veg and protein - only eating when I'm hungry, etc. Finding things that make me feel healthy and good.

I guess it is different if it is something small but I don't think you should ever compromise on the big things. I compromised myself for 5 years and I knew it wasn't right the whole time but we just kept having discussions about the relationship. It seems ridiculous now.

I think it should be easy right from the beginning if they're right for you.

There are still good guys out there but I do think the pool is kind of small, unfortunately.

I committed completely to finding someone who was compatible with my lists. I wasn't going to give someone 'more time' or let them off the hook if they were an otherwise 'nice guy'.

I was on tinder, and I wouldn't even meet with someone if I didn't think they matched my lists :)

Anyway, as I've said before, it made it really easy when I met my husband to recognise that I should invest in the relationship.

niceguys,fcvsgh0,t3_ej17f3,1578009079.0,I actually feel sorry for this one. It seems like he may have something more than being a 'nice guy' wrong with him.
childfree,fcvs22b,t3_ej276a,1578008818.0,"I also have this problem. All of my best friends from uni have kids now (apart from one) and though I keep in contact with them somewhat it isn't the same as it used to be, and finding new cf friends is hard!"
fatlogic,fcvcw9t,t1_fcvc9v2,1577999458.0,"I used to be really good at running but have lapsed out of it a bit now - I tend to do sprints/ intervals now.
One of the things I used to always say to myself when I wanted to stop (hope this doesn't sound crazy) was: ""your body can do it, it's your mind that's weak"" and I just used to keep reminding myself that and in the end I would finish without walking. It's totally all in the mind and you have to be really disciplined."
fatlogic,fcv9tmk,t1_fcv99xm,1577997637.0,"Yes exactly this ""deriding gym as neaderthal would engage in absolutely pissed me off.""

It pisses me off too, because it is just such utter rubbish. You get all kinds of people at the gym - it's something I enjoy about it. 

I think them believing this is some kind of defense mechanism though because they secretly wish they were fit. I know that my ex flatmate was really depressed about her weight at the same time as she shamed me for working out!"
childfree,fcv8vdt,t3_eixd8h,1577997068.0,"This confuses me so much.

Even if I did want a child I wouldn't have one. I'm in NZ and at the moment the haze from the Australian bushfires is making our sky look really strange. It's a daily reminder that the world is ending."
fatlogic,fcv89cs,t1_fcuz1rv,1577996703.0,Totally agree :)
fatlogic,fcv870w,t1_fcuwn4c,1577996665.0,"One of my very fat ex-flatmates used to shame me for going to the gym. She would be like ""I only like to use exercise that uses my BRAIN"" (she went to a dance class like every few months), and would say other ridiculous things. I used to always think that she had no idea at all about how much you use your brain at the gym, and how good it is for it. 

She couldn't walk up a small hill near our house without stopping."
fatlogic,fcv7xs7,t3_eizw2r,1577996512.0,"This condescending rubbish really kills me.

Going to the gym and smashing it is part of living a full life, for me. It's what I enjoy to do. I don't count calories when I'm there but it's great that burning calories is a side effect of what I love.

How are these people living 'full lives'??!"
relationship_advice,fcv7lw1,t1_fcv7fo2,1577996315.0,Good one!
relationship_advice,fcv5tkq,t1_fcv5j78,1577995251.0,"You're a fool, mate.

You're the one who doesn't understand how words work, and who thinks they can only be used in one way (the way you see on TV).

You're the one who is talking to someone with greater expertise but still wants to talk down to them with your little TV examples. You are showing the measure of your own ignorance.

And let's not forget, you're the one who is so scared of vaginas you can't go down on your wife."

Interrogate is done to someone else, not to yourself, and certainly isnt used the way youre using it. Youre not even technically right. So yeah you dont teach English.""

Dang, you got me there! My PhD and job are figments of my imagination! Your popular understanding of what 'interrogate' means certainly beats my academic understanding of it!

Or:
Interrogate 1: to question formally and systematically

Just because you got your understanding of the language from movies and tv shows doesn't mean you know its nuances."

And what I'm saying is that you want to believe that because that is in line with your dislike for oral. I think you should INTERROGATE that. Btw, in academia it is really common to use interrogate in that way :')"
