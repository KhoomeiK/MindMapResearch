Or you could avoid the 90 and get 45 degree fittings to just keep only one or two bends per tube. I’m not a fan of using fittings to make turns in hardline systems but sometimes it’s required if the bend is too tight. Thick wall tubing helps with tighter bends but it looks like you’ve got your fittings already"

Amd,fggumfr,t1_fggtawu,1580769927.0,"In 1080p. Even then, I’m some cases AMD is it’s own competition undercutting itself. A 3600 is somewhere between marginally faster and ~15% faster depending on the game and resolution and system specs than a 2600 or 2700X, which are the two predominant SKUs of that chip now. Move all this to 1440P and that gets even narrower. 

If I’m building a PC today and I’m weighing budget and performance equally, I’m going for a $160-$180 2700X that comes with a Prism OVER a 3600 with a Stealth cooler that’s questionable depending on case and airflow.  If budget/value is weighing a little heavier, it’s a 2600 all day long. That’s still enough performance getting  playable frames to tide anyone over until they can save and upgrade, and future Ryzen chips come out or get lower in price. A 3600 won’t be $179 in a year."
