StarWars,ffcmfrf,t3_eswj99,1579802561.0,I know there were people running amok In the final minutes a Luke was taking Vader’s body in the shuttle.  I always assumed a few imperials escaped as well
intermittentfasting,ffcm9zr,t3_eswjmw,1579802462.0,I find if I am not eating enough during my window I am super hungry during the day.  I eat from 4pm to 10pm.   If you are combing with keto have something good and fatty before you start to fast.  If not doing keto then protein or other food that will last longer.
