Went to my doc to tell him about it, he just shook his head, smiled and told me to stop reading stuff online... but I pressed for him to refer me to a specialist and what do you know, I was fucking right. The test came back positive. All those years, countless doctors, and google is how I finally figured it out by myself. I'm gonna see the doc again soon just to tell him I was right, lol.

Get yourself a magnesium supplement... can't recommend it enough

Sign of magnesium deficiency are: anxiety, panic attacks, stiff muscles, muscle spasms, depression, insomnia

Just make sure it's a bioavailable form (lactate, citrate are good for example while magnesium oxide is useless, we barely absorb it) and give it time. Booze, cigarettes and coffee deplete our magnesium stores, if you use those things do so a few hours away from the magnesium. I took up to 800 mg at first (split into 200 mg doses throughout the day, too much at once causes diarrhea)"

GenderCritical,fctwfre,t1_fcs7z49,1577963017.0,">  he genuinely believes that attractive young women have more power than men.

He disagrees with the notion that a man is always the oppressor simply because he's a man, and the woman *always* the victim which is what the doctrine of the intersectionality religion claims. I agree with him here and am tired of the type of ""feminism"" that tells women they're victims and prey in every possible scenario. Not very empowering, and something the old school feminists I admire also scoff at.

I'm guessing the example you're referring to is the one where he points out the fact that women do have a significant amount of power over men in *one particular aspect*, their sexual power. It is simply not a thing that happens that a (usually younger) man has the capacity to wrap an older woman around his finger and inspire her to risk everything and completely destroy her life for a quick moment of pleasure, however it is very easy for a woman to do that. There's nothing misogynistic about acknowledging this fact *that we all know about*, and he's pointing it out simply to destroy the intersectionalists claims that male = all-powerful oppressor, female = helpless powerless victim ALWAYS, just like he points out that gays on average have significantly higher earnings and asks if, by the intersectionalists' standards, that should be called a gay priviledge and jokes that maybe gays should be paying a tax to the disadvantaged heteros. He's not out there saying men are poor innocent victims of the evil b****es, and you can watch hours and hours of his talks and see that ""men's rights"" or their alleged oppression are not his talking point in general, at all. You've taken something he said about a particular dynamic between men and women in order to simply poke a hole in the intersectionality nonsense, and mischaracterized his argument to prove something you want to be true."

Douglas Murray, a gay author who has a new book called ""Madness of crowds"" where he talks about the gender insanity among other things, talks in it about some army device called the Great Viper that they throw through a minefield so it can detonate all the mines and clear the path for others, something like that. He used it as a metaphor for what he was trying to do with his book, touch upon all the ""untouchable"" subjects because he can afford to do so without losing his job, to make it safer for others to speak up. I think JKR acted like the Great Viper here too :)
