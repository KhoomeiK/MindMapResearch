AskReddit,fem2puw,t1_felmpg6,1579237802.0,"I love the Pathfinder setting and fluff, and 5th edition's accessibility. Pathfinder (and the 4th edition d&d that sent me to Pathfinder) always felt like I had to do an algebra midterm in order to figure out if my prestige class swashbuckler-inquisitor hit, and then complete a fifteen step flow chart to determine which dice to use to determine damage. Then I would do my second attack.

I've got friends at all levels of tabletop experience, from ""what do you mean THAC0 is off the table?"" to ""what does HP stand for again?"" They're all valuable parts of the story, and 5th edition allows the story to outshine the dice."
politics,fem0t35,t3_epun4a,1579236099.0,"Controversial opinion here: I agree with them not giving her the gun locks, and here's why. If pro-gun rights folks are willing to take a step towards sanity with a gun lock, as the consultant interviewed for the article (section included below) claims, *anything* that might spook them back into the bomb shelter gets the thumbs down from me. 

Let's be clear: this woman should absolutely get public funding. But the people she's speaking to are probably not the ones who are (putting their toddlers) at the highest level of risk and who need these gun locks in their lives. 

> “While I respect her clear commitment to firearms safety,” a consultant for the National Shooting Sports Foundation told an APD officer last September, “her alignment with (NSSF) Project ChildSafe and our locks could cause controversy given her political agenda and alienate gun owners and those with whom we have the most capacity to effect change.”"

The reason Trump's abnormal is because he's ignoring the system, dismantling every part of it that he can. The balancing act of the president has traditionally been to not break any laws while enriching yourself, your friends, and your party. Since Bush Jr was sworn into office despite not being elected, however, that's gone a bit sideways."
