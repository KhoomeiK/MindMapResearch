exmuslim,fcvv7xw,t1_fcvu1vm,1578010854.0,"I think what we’re disagreeing on is the fundamental point that religion can change. It’s not set in stone from day one until that last day. 

Examples include how Jesus shook up Judaism and created his own religion, how Emperor Constantine merged Christianity and paganism and decided (by a vote, no less) to preach that Jesus was divine and not just a man, and how Martin Luther pulled off the Protestant reformation and translated the bible from Latin into English.

There are a plethora of other examples of religions evolving throughout history and into the modern day, because religions aren’t books, they’re sets of ideas, which can change. The books change, too. There are multiple versions of the bible, especially after translation, that preach some greatly varied things.

Interpretations of your allegedly ‘immutable’ religious texts vary widely. For example, some sects of Christianity believe that the preachings of the New Testament override the Old Testament, while some believe that both bear equal weight.

TL; DR Religion changes, and can become more progressive as it has in the west. Organized religion is not ideal, but it’s needed by some people, and we must learn to accept that, while encouraging (quite successfully) for them to practice their religion in a progressive way. 

Thank you and good night."
exmuslim,fcvtjdv,t1_fcvs0hs,1578009770.0,"Clown? That’s not very cash money of you. Unless you mean Ronald McDonald, because he’s a pretty cool guy.

Anyway, to get to your points, I went to catholic school for ten years as a kid, where I was under the thumb of some real nutty Christians. When word got out that I’m an atheist, things got even worse. These are the Christians that take the bible literally, and often use it as an excuse to be assholes to everybody else. 

A few years after I got out of there, however, I realized that spirituality in inherent in (most if not) all people, and that organized religion often exploits that. Spirituality is not often bad, religion often is. Once I realized that, I started to understand that people are allowed to pick and choose their own beliefs, even if it strays from “what Christianity is.” 

The united church was the example I gave for progressive churches, and while it does not follow the bible the way the Catholic Church prefers to, that does not make it illegitimate. They are choosing to weigh verses about empathy, forgiveness, and inclusion as greater than verses encouraging homophobia and misogyny.

TL;DR Christianity is a wide range of beliefs, some more progressive than others. In the west, Christianity is often much more progressive than eastern Christianity and other eastern religions. Widen your ideas as to what Christianity, and belief in general, is. You might even become a happier person. Have a great life."

exmuslim,fcvnzd9,t3_ej1h60,1578006214.0,"As western culture evolved to be one more feminist, science-based, and generally respectful of human rights, western Christianity evolved to stay relevant. So at least in Toronto (where I live), there are many churches that have feminist or queer groups, have female ministers and leaders, fly rainbow flags, and perform gay weddings. They also focus much more on Jesus’ overall “peace, love, and charity”, “turn the other cheek”, and “love thy neighbour” teachings rather than his disciples’ archaic, Bronze Age additions. This makes western Christianity (for the most part), quite progressive, especially in comparison to religions in less progressive areas (including the Bible Belt).

TL;DR It’s not “from the frying pan, into the fire”, it’s a significant improvement when it comes to values. Anyhow, they’re both Abrahamic religions and don’t have too many major differences when it comes to their roots."
