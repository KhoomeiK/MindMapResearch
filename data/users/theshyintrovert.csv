socialanxiety,ff7ar97,t3_erz7la,1579644873.0,"A idea I have for an app is an online therapy line, where people can either get free therapy or a better version but it costs money. It would be for people with suicidal thoughts who don’t want to call the lifeline, people with social anxiety or any other anxiety, people with specific phobias, eating disorders, mood disorders, etc. 
I really want to make it since I could probably do most of the work at home in isolation away from people, and then I still might be able to get money. 
There’s so many people with social anxiety that are struggling in silence and at this point there just needs to be some way for people to get proper help online"

It makes going to bed feel like the warmth of the bed waking up and it makes waking up 100x better. Best gift for a constantly shivering person.

MaladaptiveDreaming,feujj0h,t3_eps5sw,1579387130.0,"There’s like sub categories of MaDD, and if there was more research on it there would probably also be a scale. For me I wasn’t sexually assaulted as a kid or abused, but my parents were divorced and I was lonely as a kid, so I believe it was developed as a coping mechanism. If the daydreaming doesn’t affect you negatively and doesn’t interfere with your daily life too badly you could have the less scary sub version of MaDD called immersive daydreaming which is caused out of boredom. But if the daydreaming is addictive and sometimes interferes a lot with daily life it could be Maladaptive. But I myself go by both titles because I do it out of boredom and I have control over it, but I’m addicted and I would much rather be in my head than reality.

But I don’t want the kids in the show to be adopted, meaning they would all have to look relatively the same, and in the plans they’re white and live in a mansion that their rich annoying grandma bought for the mom and dad. There would be sexist jokes and it would be PG 13 but with young cast members, so I feel that if it was to actually be a thing there would be controversy.... but all in all it will probs not become a thing bc of writers block.

socialanxiety,fek3o91,t3_epk5je,1579191931.0,"Since third grade I’ve mostly been taking the bus, from 5-8th grade my middle school was in one part of town and because my parents are divorced and lived in different parts of the district I could only register for school and a bus route for one house. So when I was at my dads house I would be driven and I would take the bus at my moms, so it was 1/2 and 1/2. Now I’m a sophomore and my highschool includes both districts my parents are in so I’m on two separate buses. Throughout the years I’ve catched onto multiple bus “rules”, and just like things everybody does. If your bus is an early route (a route usually takes around 30-45 mins) you have first picks at seats and stuff. I usually sit in the front or by the heater of which is placed next to the emergency exit. The back of the bus is usually where the “popular” kids, “troublemakers” or kids who want to talk sit. While the middle is mediocre, and the front for people who just want to chill. Some buses can be more packed than others, but chances are you will get your own seat. For most buses at least in highschool, the majority of kids just listen to music and stare out the window, watch tv on their phone, text, or do homework. Unless somebody has their like best friend on the bus, people usually don’t talk. I love bus rides pretty much since I’m on one of my bus rides for around 30 minutes and I can just listen to music and think about stuff and maybe even just sleep (although i always fear having to have someone wake me up), it’s not all rowdy and stuff like in the movies although the back of the bus can get a bit much, but the bus driver usually stops them. And ask the driver questions if needed, most bus drivers are reallyyy nice and helpful. I hope this helps lol buses might be different though although I’m pretty sure they aren’t that different."

My mom says that I need to start initiating stuff instead of being on the sidelines and that i need to keep conversations going with random questions. Everybody thinks I’m choosing my phone over socializing and that I’m lazy, they get offended when I hide away, but I wish people could just realize I WANT to be social, I WANT to be normal, I WANT to be able to make friends and go to events. I’ve never seen a life without being extremely shy and thinking about my every move. I didn’t choose to be like this, i can’t just turn it off, trust me if I could be social I would be. I don’t know how to stop it, I’ve tried, but it always gets worse as time goes on."

greysanatomy,feiqtbm,t1_feiq9s6,1579144892.0,"Yeah it would have to seem somewhat unique to the “greys spirit” though, and not be an obvious copy. Greys is known for randomly killing off characters and making everybody cry so the finale should definetly have both happy and sad tears and a lot of memorabilia tracing back the many past years. I think it would be cool if Meredith opened a new building or something in like Derek/Lexie/Mark’s name but it would have to be unique"
greysanatomy,fehyzc1,t3_ep5ii5,1579126713.0,"I’m a fan of both ER and Greys Anatomy, and for those who haven’t watched ER in my opinion it’s an amazing show and deserves so much more credit, the comparisons between the two are astonishing. I just finished watching the ER finale and I think Greys could do something along the lines of what ER did but in its own way. It would be like one of the longest and most memorable episodes ever. First, like ER, Greys Anatomy should have a bunch of former cast members who’re still alive come back. Examples would be Alex Karev (assuming he’s been gone for a few years) coming back for something, Izzie Stevens could come back and have a daughter and etc, Cristina Yang could come back and have a big reunion with Meredith and Owen (then MAgIC could go out for drinks and catch up and George would be remembered) Other possible characters to make appearances could be Addison Montgomery, Preston Burke, Erica Hahn, April Kepner, Stephanie Edwards etc. Arizona, Callie, Penny and Sofia could make an entrance, as well as Megan Hunt and Nathan Riggs could come into town. Since if a Greys Anatomy finale took place it would obviously have to be very big to commemorate how big of a show Greys was, so the finale would be a little much but it’s the finale so it kind of has to be. Station 19 stars and Private Practice stars could also make an appearance. Major former patients and side stars could also make an appearance as well. Some idea(s) for the storyline(s) would be that Richard Webber dies from an ongoing illness (theme of part of the final season), and people return for the funeral.  Depending on how old Zola is when the show ends, she could have a side storyline of getting ready for medical school, looking for a possible career, or mourning her father after something. Something could also happen to Meredith and the finale would be lead by Zola saying bye to her mother as she lived her final days and all Merediths past co workers returned. 

Also to remember the past cast members who have died Greys should definetly mention them and honor them in some way.... one example is Baileys son Tucker could be considering enlisting in the army and bailey has troubles coping with it because of what happened with George. Jackson could have a flashback to when Reed and Charles were around saying something like how he was the only one still around. Zola could do something with missing Derek and Meredith tells her stuff. Mark could be remembered in a way along with Lexie. And any other dead characters could be mentioned or an Easter egg displayed.

Because there have been so many memorable moments and themes of greys anatomy, some of the biggest could be shown. The first ever scene of Greys and the big speech could be flash backed and Meredith notices how she’s the only one left. The post it note could show up. The main theme song, chasing cars, etc. Merediths most memorable patients, Alzheimer’s, Ellis Grey, Merediths father, etc could be shown. 

The show should definetly leave off on a note that allows for possible spinoffs or reboots, but doesn’t ensure it. Such as Zola, Sofia, or Tucker going into medical school or something. It should leave off on a note related to the grey offspring. But it should also have closure with main cast members moving on or something. And maybe a death to add to the greys spirit

Sorry I got like really into this...😬"
