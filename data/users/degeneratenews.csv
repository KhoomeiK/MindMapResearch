Twenty years ago when pure was still a thing, naked cartwheels wouldn't even be possible.  Your whole body is trembling too hard from the sensory overload to do anything more than a cute bear cub roll.  Dancing, or hopping up and down, is about the most strenuous thing I've seen an etard do.

russiaoralabama,ff5i5pc,t1_ff5f8nj,1579593966.0,"During and after the Cold War, a lot of Russian scientist and engineers came into the country as asylum seekers.  They would get placed in the Sacramento area because we had 3 Air Force bases within 60 miles and a big aerospace engineering contractor out here.  We were the #2 Target for a nuke attack for a while.  

Those families formed small communities near the bases in and around Rancho Cordova and Antelope. With the communities came churches and non military asylum seekers.  

After the Cold War there were mass migrations and people wanted to be near their families so a lot of them moved to the area.  

I was ""friend adopted"" by a Russian family growing up.  It was cool getting second holidays, and they taught me how to party.  Their family were Ruska Roma, so I heard all sorts of crazy stories about curses and exorcists.  Fun stuff!"

news,ff0rm1h,t1_fext99q,1579471666.0,"True, for people who aren't in poverty.  

Having an extra $200-300 to pay for a secured card is not a luxury a lot of people have.  Especially if their credit report is already tarnished with utility and medical collections.  If they have judgements too, then a secured card isn't always an option either.   

You do realize that some people, even in developed countries, can't even open a bank account, right?  The prepaid industry thrives on this, at the expense of the consumer.  It's a multi billion dollar industry for a reason, it exploits poor people with no or bad credit.

Finally, Western credit systems are designed to make a bunch of profit off of poor people.  The rate right now for secured cards is 15-25%, which is huge.  On a card with a security deposit to cover non payment, meaning you can't ""borrow"" more then you have already spent as a security deposit, yet you are still getting charged a ridiculously high interest rate.  And paying it off every month is an option, but one that does very little to help your credit as the reporting agencies want to see you paying interest.  It is actually a huge factor in calculating your credit score which is why credit repair companies suggest you keep a 30% balance on all revolving debt.  

I understand how it's easy to say something when you've never experienced the other end of a spectrum, but just getting a secured credit card is not a good solution for a lot of people who have been poor their whole lives or had a catostophic financial experience.
