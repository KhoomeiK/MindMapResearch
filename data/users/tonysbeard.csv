(Ok guys, this is the part where you get mad and try to prove me wrong by naming a bunch of good Mexican places. Please. Please tell me where to find the good stuff. This New Mexican girl is dying.)"

No ""happy anniversary to the future first lady"" or anything like that. He just loves her and this post reads like any other person posting on their anniversary. He's just a good guy."

MaliciousCompliance,fehckax,t1_fefoqb2,1579113769.0,Oh my god. THANK YOU. Literally my first thought as well and I got downvoted to oblivion for it.
MaliciousCompliance,fehce7c,t1_fegkinm,1579113671.0,"That's assuming the woman realized OP was trying to help in the split second she turned around and realized someone was grabbing her bag. I live in a big city where you have to constantly be on alert for pickpockets. If I was in the same situation, I don't think I would have the time to think ""oh, is this stranger trying to help me? Thank you stranger."" 

And no... ""keep your hands off"" doesn't sound at all like ""quit trying to help"" because that would imply she knew OP was trying to help."
MaliciousCompliance,feg6l0l,t3_eoupx2,1579079375.0,Um... sounds like the woman thought you were trying to steal her bag. Seems like a simple misunderstanding and you were just a dick to a stranger for no reason.

Paranormal,fdju6g6,t1_fdisb12,1578487610.0,"I'm sorry about what's happening with your mom. That's really hard to feel like you aren't being believed. 

About non human spirits, the best way to describe it would be ""demons."" But the word demon is strongly tied to religion so I prefer not to use it. I just think there are beings on another plane of existence that feed on our energy and interact with us in different ways. I think they can pick up on the energy in a place and assume a role they think fits their needs. Like imitating someone who lived in the house."
Paranormal,fdjtx80,t1_fdj2k0r,1578487361.0,"Through observation and possibly being able to read your mind. I think sometimes, though, people have the same experience with spirits that they do with fake psychics where the person is just good at leading you into thinking they're saying or doing something very personal. (Just a quick aside: I also believe there are real and good psychics, there are just a lot of fakes).

Spirits study human nature and we really aren't that hard to figure out when it comes down to it."
Paranormal,fdiow2q,t3_elblcc,1578447738.0,"Please give us an update!!!

 Although... I feel a little uneasy about you and your daughter reading that book. I personally don't believe in human spirits. I believe that when we die we have a little time to say goodbye and then we have to leave  this plane. I do believe that non-human spirits can imitate humans, though. 

I don't think an author who was worried about being forgotten would send out that level of negative energy. I just worry that there's something else going on here. Could you call your wiccan friend and ask her for advice? Depending on what kind of magic she practices, she may be able to help you protect yourselves while you're in the house. 

Have you and your mom talked about what's going on?"

We also were pretty worthless siblings until we were adults and weren't really close to our older brother. But older brother had a baby 6 months ago and now I talk to him all the time because that baby is way too cute to ignore. That little girl is so spoiled by her weird aunt and uncle!

AskReddit,fd3qwai,t1_fd1j4rn,1578160937.0,"I had the same realization in NYC. I brought my car with me when I moved out here so that I could escape when I needed to. But it takes a solid hour to even drive out of the city and the tolls at the tunnel are ridiculous. So after living in Brooklyn for two years, I finally took the plunge and got un-cool by moving to Jersey. I still commute into the city every day for work so I still experience the ""big city life."" But now I can also drive 30 mins in the other direction and chill out in suburbia and trees. I hated it here but I can't really leave because my career is based here. So I compromised and am much happier now"

AskNYC,fckmsza,t1_fcjzj9v,1577728726.0,A storage unit helped me immensely when I was in a tiny apartment. I got one at CubeSmart and it was $50/mo for the smallest one (I think it was a 5x5). My boyfriend and I were able to put all our seasonal clothes as well as all the other random stuff we didn't have space got anymore. I was surprised by how much I was able to fit in there and it made such a huge difference in my apartment. Highly recommend it

unpopularopinion,fc0fti3,t3_efgn2y,1577289802.0,"Truly an unpopular opinion! Take your upvote.

This makes me think of a story I read on r/offmychest (I think? It may have been r/confessions) about a woman with two sons. One was severely disabled to the point he didn't react to anything. He couldn't walk or talk, was fed through a feeding tube, and had absolutely zero reactions to anything in his environment. Her other son had no disabilities. She said her husband had died in a workplace accident but she believed he actually killed himself because of the pressure. She said her older son (the one without disabilities) resented the younger one for taking both his parents from him. One time she walked in on her oldest hitting the youngest with a pillow and yelling ""you're ruining my life"" (or something like that) and the youngest was not reacting at all. 

The confession she made was that she was putting the youngest in a home so she could forget about him. The sad thing is, this woman will continue to have to be financially responsible for the care of a child who literally doesn't have the ability to remember she exists or that she's his mom or that she pretty much gave everything up for him. So while your opinion may sound cruel to some, there are some families that love their children very much but may actually be doing them a disservice by keeping them alive. What kind of life does this kid have? Even if he has some hidden consciousness that isn't been expressed outwardly, he's tortured every day by being trapped in a body that won't allow him to do so. And if he is just as non-responsive on the inside as he is on the outside, that's it's own kind of hell to live in.

Thanks for your opinion. Legislation like this would be terribly difficult to implement because you would literally have to define who has the right to live, but it honestly could save people a lot of pain and suffering."
