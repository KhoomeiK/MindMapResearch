PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fe1hf75,t3_engc94,1578826543.0,"The advice offered by the community is solid. So personally, all I've done to improve recently is be more aggressive, and play more confidently.

I've been playing for ages, probably average level player though. Had a decent amount of wins over the last couple of years, but only got my first wins of this season last night.

I found myself frustrated by getting 2nd and 3rd place sooo often this season, and I decided it was probably down to trying to be too sneaky, or impatient. then I realised I was actually being a bit of a pussy late game.

My advice would be to have faith in your strengths - I've noticed a big increase in kills and higher placement, purely from playing more aggressively than before.

You say your strengths are close quarters, which is perfect for final circle. Keep practicing other elements in training, but if it isn't working in game, reposition for close quarter fights where possible.

Oh and don't forget to keep a cool head - don't let adrenaline get the better of you! :)

Tl;dr: keep cool, play to strengths, be more confident"
