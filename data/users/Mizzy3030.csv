For reference, I'm 5'3 and just measured mine at 9.5 inches unflexed (a little over 11 when flexed), which I feel like would look very skinny on someone taller, but not someone with my build."

nyc,ffmf99k,t1_ffmey41,1580053771.0,Not what I'm asking. Why didn't mta suspend service after the first train hit her? There was a 20 minutes period of her laying on the tracks bleeding to death.  Am I to understand there was no one around who saw or noticed her being hit/laying on the tracks? Not a single person was in the station to alert authority? The first train didn't feel that it hit something out of the norm?
nyc,ffmcwhi,t3_eu6gz9,1580052595.0,"Maybe I'm being naive, but wouldn't the MTA suspend service on the tracks after the first hit? This makes it seem like they continued to run trains and the *only* reason she didn't get hit twice was because the second train miraculously spotted her. There's something very odd about the reporting of this story."

First thing MOnday morning contact the department or the person who gave the e-Permit, and more importantly attend the first day of class no matter what. Even if you are not formally registered Monday or Tuesday, I guarantee they will figure it out for you before the add deadline, and you don't want to miss important information."

CUNY,ffitk0s,t3_etup05,1579982363.0,Getting an ePermit does not guarantee you a spot in that class. You still need to go on CUNYFirst and search for the class at the campus you were approved for and sign up for the class.  For all you know it may be full by now.

Professors,fffzpq5,t1_fffwawt,1579895327.0,"I think it's really weird and inappropriate to comment about people's personal traits to their face like that, even if the intentions are good.  Do you think our students go around telling their GPs and/or people who serve them at restaurants that they are ""eccentric"" or ""dorky""?  I just don't get why they think it's alright to talk to us that way.  I regularly get old by my female students that I am ""cute"" (I am a female as well), as if I am supposed to be flattered by that. All it does it make me feel uncomfortable."

In my experience, people who are confrontational like this YouTuber have a tendency to turn whatever response they get into a ""win"" for their side.  If OP tells her to go away she'll just say this is proof that he has no valid response; if OP eats the mic she will use it as evidence that the only response the other side has is aggression.  There is honestly no winning against such people.  If it were me, I might just yawn in her face and call on her bullshit, but that might be a ""losing"" strategy as well."

Only if the student is registered with the disabilities office on campus. Otherwise, professor has no way of knowing.  That said, I am a full-time professor and can attest that you would NOT be suspended over one incident like this.  Things in academia move at a glacial pace, and there are thorough investigations into any allegation of misdeeds.  Hard to know what actually happened with this professor, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that this was the one incident that led to him being fired or suspended, or whatever."

The guy literally moved across the country and got engaged to a woman he barely knew, only to move her and her daughter back to a town where he was, for all intents and purposes, homeless and jobless! I don't think Buddy is in a position to be doling out any advice about: A. Moving, and B. Taking things slow.

xxfitness,ff6ksaj,t3_erxs1m,1579629316.0,"One thing has helped me tremendously is thinking of loooong-term goals. I'm not talking 6 or 12 months from now.  I'm thinking 10 - 20 years down the line.  I was caught in the same self-loathing cycle as you for many years (until about the age of 37). My primary goal was always to either weigh less and/or have the ""perfect"" body. The only reason I worked out was to give myself permission to eat.  I think you know from personal experience that when your primary motivation for working out is losing weight and the weight isn't coming off, you just get discouraged and depressed, and end up really hating doing anything healthy for yourself. 

 Ultimately, I love movement, as I think most humans do.  I have always loved being active, but my obsession with my weight was making me hate it.  So, I decided to figuring out what were the things I can do to keep myself healthy in the moment, that I will also enjoy and be able to do in 20 years time.  I'm not going to tell you what those things are for me, because they may not work for you, so all I can do is encourage you to think about it (maybe make a list of your favorite healthy foods and activities).  Do you want to still be active and happy when you're 50? 60? even 80?  If the answer is yes, then you need to focus on the things you love, not hate."

Not weighing myself at home has made a huge positive impact for me, though I understand that may not work for everyone."

You want to make the argument that OP is somehow selfish, and is the product of individualistic thinking? OP is just a teenager who has literally donated hundreds of her own dollars to her friend by buying her wigs, and how does her friend respond?
