politics,feuhsr1,t1_feu9il7,1579386642.0,I wish cannabis vapes were okay. I don’t like smoking and I don’t like vaporizers (they all seem shit but maybe I’ve just been unlucky). I tried a cannabis vape and it was the weirdest high ever. Not enjoyable at all. I was not stoned and then I’d cough and I was 1000000% stoned. It wasn’t nice and felt weird like a chemical high rather than a natural high. It smelled like cannabis but who knows really what it was.

GreenAndPleasant,fel00e5,t1_fekjh3n,1579211143.0,Don’t let them take your individual power. Amazon is made up of millions of individual choices people make. You can only control your own actions. A constant movement in one direction can cause exponential growth or decay. I don’t know the word for anti-viral like when a once significant thing rapidly loses significance. Amazon grew based on the economy of the masses and it could easily move away if 20% of the population decide to use a different store front. It is your choice and yours alone. You can’t blame big business or the wealthy for your individual choices. I don’t want to sound preachy I am in the same boat. I decided I didn’t like amazon and I don’t want to give them my money. It was a choice. I am trying to convince you to do the same if you can. You try and convince another and we can get an anti-viral-spiral for Amazon. I don’t want to see the company dead I want to see them having a lot less of the pie.
GreenAndPleasant,fekza28,t1_fekrx8q,1579210707.0,It took 108 years of writing letters before the English outlawed slavery. A letter writing campaign must have seemed futile and pointless but over time a momentum builds. Amazon did not become what it is overnight and it will not go away overnight. It did become successful quickly and just as quickly it could go away. Positive and negative feedback is exponential so small but constant movement in one direction can have huge repercussions over time and this is even more true online.

And I feel foolish when I see people who have much more money and don’t give a shit at all.

University of Pennsylvania professor Alan Charles Kors and lawyer Harvey A. Silverglate connect speech codes in US universities to Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse. They claim that speech codes create a ""climate of repression"", arguing that they are based on ""Marcusean logic"". The speech codes, ""mandate a redefined notion of ""freedom"", based on the belief that the imposition of a moral agenda on a community is justified"", a view which, ""requires less emphasis on individual rights and more on assuring ""historically oppressed"" persons the means of achieving equal rights.""

Itâ€™s crazy to think Russia and China will not help Iran with aid, cover, training and support. Of  course they would publicly condemn attacks but they would also covertly support any move that destabilizes the US. Why wouldnâ€™t they? 

Car bombs are cheap, chemical weapons are cheap, human life is cheap. Devastation is cheap. It will happen on US soil to the public, in business centers, it will go after your heart. Where will America send itâ€™s military? Where will they bomb? And for what reason. Iran has been around for 9000 years. Do you really think they canâ€™t outlast the states - foolish."

University of Pennsylvania professor Alan Charles Kors and lawyer Harvey A. Silverglate connect speech codes in US universities to Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse. They claim that speech codes create a ""climate of repression"", arguing that they are based on ""Marcusean logic"". The speech codes, ""mandate a redefined notion of ""freedom"", based on the belief that the imposition of a moral agenda on a community is justified"", a view which, ""requires less emphasis on individual rights and more on assuring ""historically oppressed"" persons the means of achieving equal rights.""

Itâ€™s a form of mind control. Political correctness - I mean just think about the term. Is it not very dystopian and fascist sounding. Right thinking police. 

My problem is not with inclusivity. My problem is with shill companies and idiots on the internet using it to silence unwelcome beliefs and ideas."
