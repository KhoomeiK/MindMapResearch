relationship_advice,fcipvmz,t3_ehe9x7,1577666998.0,"You don't necessarily be sorry about what you do/say, but you can at least apologize for hurting the person you did/said it to. You shouldn't fake apologize because you'll probably end up doing it again and hurting your relationship with them, but it would be a lot more helpful if I knew exactly what you're doing to warrant every relationship telling you you need to learn how to apologize. Are you too blunt? Are you a cheater? It depends on the situation."

aww,fcihx4l,t3_ehb706,1577662826.0,I used to do this when I was younger after watching Toy Story lol. I would say goodbye to my toys and make a bunch of noise running down the stairs and then creep as quietly as possible back up the stairs so my toys couldn't hear me.. I never did catch them in the act...
relationship_advice,fcbw9zp,t1_fcarrsw,1577591671.0,"I really admire you both holding onto this relationship and making it work as well as you can long distance, but it really seems like both of you aren't in a position for a sacrifice. He has a really good job and you moved your whole life across the country, WITH a horse (I can't imagine how much time, effort, and money you spent on raising it let alone carting it out west). It really seems like your best interest is to stay there until further notice. I don't know if either of you would be willing to keep doing long distance for a couple more months/years, but then you'd be risking falling even more in love with being out west and establishing a full on life there.
If it were me, I definitely wouldn't decide anything unless he's willing to take the steps to actually take the relationship farther, but it seems like you both might need a break. I don't really like suggesting ending things or taking a break because it's easier for me to say it then for you to want to do it and actually go through with it, but in the positions you both are in it might make sense.. it's not fair to either of you to ask the other to pick up and leave since you both put a lot of effort into your careers. Unless someone gives, then the argument could become more and more heated until someone finally breaks and either moves (and then resents the other for making them choose out of passion) or you both just call it quits (possibly on a bad note). No one else needs to know about the break (if you choose to take one) but also breaks are really messy and you'll most likely just fall back into being in a relationship again without resolving anything. It's also really unfair for him to say that you can ""just move"" because of your schooling. Yes doctors are needed everywhere and yes new England has some really amazing schools for doctors but you just moved out there and you're already in the thick of it, it's not a choice you made lightly.

He also really needs to at least talk to someone or I really think he will be projecting his frustrations on his families 'perfection' onto you and/or any future you have with him. I really worry that this relationship could become accidentally toxic really quick if some common ground isn't met. Maybe your grounds for moving back could be that he has to see someone for his traumas? 

Either way sometimes people just have to spend some time apart. I know he probably really doesn't want to end things with you for fear of what his family thinks (and because he loves you) and I don't know exactly where you guys are from, but there has to be a town that's cheaper than where he lives where he is able to buy a house alone with a 6 figure job?! (Unless you're from a major city?! That part doesn't really matter because there's always time to buy a house later) I think I saw you mentioned you were friends with him and then stopped talking, and then started dating a little while later, maybe that needs to happen again so you both know what you really want, or maybe you have both grown to want different things and that's okay too!! 
You have such a difficult decision to make and I wish you all the best. My very first *serious* relationship was my hardest to decide on, he moved away to better his life (and in turn, ours) and it ended up being too difficult to manage long term so we ended it. A couple years later he moved back and we started talking again, but he kept talking about moving again and I was all for it, but I had too many opportunities to turn down at home so I didn't end up going with him and we've been apart ever since. He was my best friend before and while we dated and we both still check up on each other from time to time. We always said maybe in another life or maybe when we're older time will bring us back but as long as he's happy I don't regret not moving with him. It was a journey for him to take- not for the both of us. Maybe being out west is your journey you need to take! It seems like your friends are really respectful and you really like it. Sometimes love isn't enough to keep a relationship alive."
SkincareAddiction,fc99h7p,t1_fc8j2ia,1577549197.0,I probably should have mentioned that we are both not even 5 feet tall.. lol In no way do I actually want to be 90 lbs but it's just crazy how some people don't even have to try to lose weight when others struggle so hard
relationship_advice,fc7nwmm,t1_fc7kzrz,1577513814.0,"Girl it's no problem hahah I feel like we have a lot in common! (I'm actually from New England too!) It really seems like you guys had a decently healthy relationship.. it takes a strong relationship to survive long distance for any amount of time, and its good he let you go even for temporary reasons.  I don't know if he's scared to move away from his family (since he basically takes care of his brother, maybe he feels responsible for him-like he wouldn't survive without his care) maybe his parents will make him feel like he's failed if he quits his job at his company to move in with you, or maybe he feels he can't quit his job just yet to move to Arizona (I'm not sure if you mentioned what exactly he does but I know you said he works for a fortune 500 company). I understand when he says you can basically just come back and be a doctor since doctors are needed anywhere, but if you really love the area you're in and depending on what state you have to move back to (if it's Connecticut don't do it LOL) then it might not be worth it. I honestly need to know more details on what he does/how much time he spent on getting this job in order to say if he's being unfair or unreasonable. It does seem like he expects a lot from you and that could be coming from his family (since they are a high expectation family) so maybe that's why he wants you to go to an Ivy League (and also if you end up going there it would impress his family even more). 

I would also lay down some ground rules IF you were to move back as well. His brother should not be allowed to live with you guys, since he breaks things you buy and screams at you when you get the chance. That's not a healthy environment for anyone, and if he can't understand that then I wouldn't move back regardless if you're together or not. It will create another situation you need to tip toe around and I can guarantee you will regret the decision eventually. Family almost always sides with family regardless if they're right or wrong (I learned this from my ex whose family lied to the police in front of me about him trying to stab me when they saw it with their own eyes).   

I just don't like the whole 'guilty' feeling that comes along with this, because he may not be directly trying to guilt you, but he is still making you feel some subconscious guilt when it seems like he doesn't even want to try anything that can help your relationship  \[either progress or amicably end\]. It seems like he expects you to do a whole lot while he does what is best for him. It's easier to stay where you are comfortable and where you have established your life, and it is not easy to pick up everything and leave to be with someone across the country. BUT at the same time I will reiterate that it is not easy to pick up and leave to be across the country with someone even if you love them. I think your biggest selling point is to get him to agree to a little bit of therapy, and if he can't do that, then I fear the rest of your life you'll be dealing with screaming matches with him any time you disagree. I mean, what if he does actually move out west instead? Will he resent you his whole life?

I just want to remind you that I am in no way trying to bash him or his family, or telling you to leave him. I am just trying to help you understand from my perspective and from my own experiences."

relationship_advice,fc7j1dc,t1_fc7irh1,1577508969.0,"I also want to point out from my first paragraph, that if there are children involved or other reasons to stay (like family) then its okay but don't let him guilt you into staying just because of his traumas. If you would rather stay if he proposes, then I would def let him know. AND if you're good with getting engaged without an expensive ring (if money is the main problem in his reasons why he won't propose) then express to him you don't give a rats ass about an expensive ring- there's always time to go buy one later! You can always be engaged for a little while too, if need be. (Of course this is only if you want!)"
relationship_advice,fc7irh1,t1_fc7gs1t,1577508717.0,"Can I tell you that I totally understand  what you mean for that whole last paragraph? I was also in an abusive relationship for over 3 years and gave up pretty much everything to satisfy them. Currently, I'm in a much better relationship and my boyfriend always tells me that if I feel like I need to do something, then I should do it and not think about if he will like it or not. Now, this doesn't apply to every single relationship, but the fact that he gives me that choice is partly why I feel so secure with him. If something were to happen and I get an offer or have to move, he won't be happy but he won't make me feel like I'm forced to stay. It's okay to be selfish sometimes even if you hurt the people you love, as long as it's for your own happiness. No one is more important than YOU. It's true that sometimes you have to make sacrifices, but I feel if you're giving something up that you feel is a big sacrifice, then they should be able to somehow reciprocate that. (Or at least you know they would do the same for you if the roles were reversed).

The delays for the proposal are pretty reasonable, but it's also not your responsibility to tip toe around his fear of embarrassment. Embarrassment is inevitable no matter what you do, and he needs to know how to deal with his own traumas with his family or else he will just project it onto you and any future family that you guys may have. (And I'm really not trying to be insensitive and saying you need to totally ignore his trauma, but it's also mainly his responsibility to heal) 

Honestly his whole family seems a little immature, (really his brother, who breaks things that aren't his). Does his family not like you? Does his brother not like you? Is that why he breaks things? Does he have a mental illness/is he young? It seems like most of the pressure is put on your SO to be the best he can be while they ignore the brother. You also shouldn't have to feel embarrassed when someone is screaming profanities at YOU, at some point you will reach a breaking point (which it seems like you did) and that also brings me back to, do you really want this to be the future with you and your SO? 

 I feel like the fact that he just instantly turns into an argument (going back to the original post) when you bring it up and the fact that his brother screams at you as well just goes to show you how the whole family communicates. No doubt their trauma is real, but it isn't your responsibility to heal any of them especially if they don't even realize it and/or they haven't sought out a real way to help them communicate their frustrations. I'm sorry this is so long and I'm probably forgetting to cover some things.. but there seems like a lot of information (as one would expect with such a long relationship). Maybe actually talking to a professional would help? If you're into it. I will also try to help as much as I can, I hope this all helped at least a little, lol."
relationship_advice,fc7g2bi,t1_fc7f6vx,1577506352.0,I also don't know if you're comfortable or if he will even reply or take it seriously if you texted him or called him about it while he wasn't there. Sometimes it's easier and a lot less heated if you do it over the phone.
relationship_advice,fc7fxmw,t1_fc7f6vx,1577506241.0,"It depends on if he's quick to get hints or not. You could hint that you don't like to be kept waiting up every time he comes to visit and it would be nice if he could just text you or call to say he'll be late or he's going to be out until further notice.

But for some people you just have to be completely direct and tell them that it's hard for you to keep going about your normal life when you don't know when he is coming back. Let him know that you love having him over but he needs to respect your home. If you're worried about yourself getting too heated then my best advice (since I do not know either of you personally) is to breathe when you feel like yelling and keep breathing (even if he is saying things to you back) and keep your voice calm. He seems like he has it pretty good and you guys have had a pretty good relationship up until he started testing your patience. It's always the ones we love the most that test our patience the most. If it's too heated, you can always walk away and try again when you're calmer. 

I would definitely try to reach a common ground that is at least easier for you first though. Maybe he can pay for a spare key for him to keep while he's there and give back when he leaves, or you guys can hide a key for him while he's there and he can give it back."
relationship_advice,fc7f3i1,t3_eglnp5,1577505530.0,"It depends on individual relationships BUT if you go to a strip club with your significant other and they get mad at the strippers doing their job then they put themselves in that situation and honestly can't even be mad. Everyone knows what happens at strip clubs lol. But if they explicitly express to you that they would be uncomfortable with you getting a topless lap dance, or going to the club in general then you probably shouldn't go unless you want to be single/get into a huge argument. 

Some people don't agree with it at all and don't get why but honestly it's based on individual preferences and it's up to you and your partner to discuss it. Some people get off on seeing their partner enjoy other people and that's not up for anyone to judge.

I am a female btw."

relationship_advice,fc7dydc,t3_egldxo,1577504588.0,"What I don't get is why he has been talking about engagement for so long but he hasn't proposed? And it seems a little odd that he will feel embarrassed if you guys break up because that could be a reason he holds on even though he knows that the relationship might not work. Maybe he's scared since you both have been together for so long?  

I also don't like that he doesn't seem to take your concerns seriously and it becomes an argument if you voice your opinion. I don't see your previous post, but I'm curious to read it to see what you mean about buying a house. 

I think that if you feel like you'll be held back if you leave Arizona, (and I mean held back as in you'll also deeply regret it) then any man that isn't willing to put your happiness above anything else is not good for you."
relationship_advice,fc7cv0v,t3_egle6x,1577503708.0,You're definitely not over-reacting. He is taking advantage of your hospitality by not letting you know what is going on. It's not fair that you have to revolve your plans around him just because he is visiting. He should be doing things according to your schedule- especially of you guys don't charge him for staying over. If you can't make him a spare key (which I would recommend) then you should have a talk with him about letting you know what's going on with his plans. Even if his plans change last minute it's still good to know instead of you waiting up for him unaware of when he's coming back. If you don't want to totally cut him out of staying over then is there a place you could hide a key for him when he gets back? So you don't have to wait up.
