VAGuns,ff9wehs,t3_esc6xs,1579722971.0,Remember this. The gun control side of the debate avoids the Founding Fathers and concentrates of gun control legislation and arguments from the 1960’s and later. Many don’t know the debates or the even court cases before this time frame that reference the Founders. Do some homework and find the papers or copies of the writing from the Revolution or the period after. These debates have been hashed over before. The arguments and language from those debates are clear and eloquent frequently. They are an invaluable aid. Nothing like quoting a Founding Father during a discussion w/o letting your opponent know. Then expose them to it and reveal their loyalties.
