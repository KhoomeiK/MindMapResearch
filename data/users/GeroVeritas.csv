nfl,ff12uyv,t1_ff0td9f,1579474698.0,Small market doesn't mean it's harder. Look at SA. A competent front office and coaching staff will always attract talent. Bucks have that in spades. Experience and depth is what they need to get the ring. I think they're great but they lack those 2 factors this year which makes them not the best team. In my opinion.
nfl,ff0lsxo,t1_ff0bvky,1579470100.0,At first I got emotionally triggered by your comment and downvoted. Then cooler heads prevailed. Well done.

AskReddit,fewgwk5,t1_ferqf7q,1579410388.0,"One of my favorite things about this movie is they dont shy away or cover up emotional moments. Most movies now a days dont let you bask in tragedy, they will use a joke to cover it or shift the moment. Into the Spiderverse embraced the moment. I appreciated that."

whowouldwin,fedc4b0,t1_febysp9,1579007229.0,I see what you did there.
whowouldwin,fe28n8s,t1_fdxall5,1578835648.0,I dont recall that part in the game but he is quite literally the exact opposite. He is far and away the best sword fighter with near perfect skill and technique. He has so much speed and power that it only ever takes 1 strike to kill humans and most monsters.
EmpireDidNothingWrong,fe03vdr,t1_fe00loj,1578802418.0,Great app. Thanks for the tip
respectthreads,fdzh8hr,t3_enf2jv,1578790214.0,This RT is a month too late but I appreciates it all the same. Cheers
whowouldwin,fdx57wb,t1_fdwts34,1578765485.0,Interesting. What basis are you going off for Geralt? Both book and game Geralt are the best sword fighters in their respective worlds.
television,fdve993,t1_fdu7011,1578746515.0,More mature? The dude is already super old and the difference between the books and game is only a couple years. The difference of the portrayal is purely because of the writers.
whowouldwin,fdszwtp,t3_emp0ra,1578710116.0,Man I dont have nearly enough knowledge to weigh in but this looks to be the most even battle with great conversation happening I've ever seen on this sub. Great WWW. This is why I love this sub.

whowouldwin,fdgp9ty,t1_fdgbana,1578404683.0,"Good write up but I dont agree with some of your assessments of Dooku. Dooku goads people. He taunts and mocks. He is cocky and arrogant. These are all sith related characteristics that play into the exact thing that vapaad feeds off of. Notice how Mace doesn't show emotion when he battles. He rarely speaks, changes facial expressions. He doesn't even grunt. He is channeling vapaad against the very people who use anger, over confidence, and deceit against them. Mace would beat Dooku every single time."

whowouldwin,fd8weyb,t1_fd6lj40,1578224422.0,Ciri doesn't teleport people. She teleports herself. Even if she took him with her to leave him somewhere she would have to grab him and deadpool would have the opportunity to take hair.
whowouldwin,fd8tr7r,t1_fd8qjmi,1578223316.0,The blades in Witcher are crafted in a fantasy setting. It's like GoT or LoTR. Blades are magical and superior to real life swords. Also Geralt is physically stronger and faster than everyone in the Witcher universe so I dont think the difference in speed and strength to Blade is that great.
whowouldwin,fd8t3wz,t3_ekac90,1578223088.0,With prep Geralt takes every single one of these. He consumes a decoction and uses signs to put them off balance then finishes them.
whowouldwin,fd8s0du,t3_ekapiv,1578222583.0,"Game Geralt may take this. It depends on if an oil and devotions are effective against Guts. A toxic build of Geralt is ridiculously powerful and gives him unlimited stamina and increases his strength the further the battle. Guts has a massive sword but Game Geralt also gets perks and runes that add the range of his sword to over 2 meters so that doesn't matter. 
I'd say Game Geralt takes this (even without eating wheels of cheese to recover his health) 8/10"
worldnews,fd8pyc1,t3_ekayz3,1578221624.0,This is not the first time he has verbally threatened to commit a war crime. He did it before he was even in office. I'm not condoning it nor am I saying its right but the fact he does do it comes with no repercussions or consequences. He could do it every single day and it wont matter. That's the world we now live in. Sadly.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fcuthjt,t1_fcurv3x,1577988175.0,Well at least they have specific builds for those playstyles. Chugging potions is extremely beneficial for a high toxicity build. Essential actually.
whowouldwin,fcuaf80,t1_fcu069m,1577976380.0,"To add to this. Geralt is roughly around one hundred years old. He is more experienced than everyone aside from mages and Vesemir. Also, Dijstra is approximately the size of the Mountain and Geralt broke his leg with a punch. Geralt could beat the Mountain with his hand. Give him a sword and it's not even close."

whowouldwin,fc9n9jt,t1_fc93xpt,1577555245.0,"I took this as the only the states from the Civil War are partaking so California would not be included. If it's all of current USA then where do you draw the line? 
Not enough information is given so with the little amount we have, yes Texas would be the catalyst for the South to win."
whowouldwin,fc8wzwn,t1_fc8qhm8,1577543414.0,Just off the top of my head Texas has the largest army and it's own electrical power grid. It bolsters the South far mar than any other state does for its side.
nba,fc8rw3c,t3_egn0fc,1577540884.0,"No. If the Knicks won 4 in a row would you say they are making a turn around? Any team,for that matter, can win 4 in a row. It isnt that impressive if its preceded by only 5 wins in 29 games."
whowouldwin,fc8qfqk,t3_egqbng,1577540111.0,Are you allowing Texas as part of the south? Because that means the South wins.
