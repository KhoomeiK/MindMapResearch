AskReddit,fcn7rn5,t3_ehqlpz,1577805476.0,"Not a nurse, but used to oversee infection control and had a podiatrist who left toenail clippings all over his treatment rooms to the point that it was a regular occurrence. No matter how much of a stink I made about it the higher ups wouldn't do or enforce anything.  One of the sterilization techs even found a box of used instruments that didn't belong to the facility, all just chilling in a random metal container. 

He was finally forced to retire because he left a patient schedule (with social security numbers) in his room, face up and unlocked... Not because he was disgusting or anything."

weddingshaming,fcn2fev,t1_fcmf8gd,1577801368.0,"When I was in college I was gifted a couple fish, and while cleaning the tank I put one back in too fast and the shock killed it. It was my first fish and I was clueless, but I still cried for hours. I then called a friend of mine who walked me through fish care and helped me set up a proper tank. She said I did a good job because I got my albino cory catfish to lay eggs- I'm not sure if this is true or not but it made me feel better. I wish I'd known better so I could have done better in the beginning, but I'll make sure my children understand that even the smallest pet still deserves respect."
