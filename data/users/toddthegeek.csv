I bet if you managed it you might look back at this comment and think why on Earth did I do those things."
Cooking,ffe1q3t,t1_ffcb7v8,1579834420.0,"People lose their heads when they find out I don't have one.  First question is ""Why!?"" followed by ""How do you reheat leftovers?""  They think I'm either crazy or poor.  And microwaves can be had for like $60 so I don't understand the judgement of being poor.

I really don't get the microwave thing.  I really never used one when I had one.  When I did it was usually disappointment.

I'm not wasting counter space on a microwave.  Toaster oven is much more useful.

My brother knows I'm anti-microwave.  He bought me one for Christmas one year.  He treated it as if it was the best gift ever.  Again, we don't have space for it.  So we returned it.  He still tells people how horrible I am for returning his gift.  I got him a toaster oven.  He returned that.  But I'm still the bag guy."

12 x 2.  11 on a side plus one on the end makes 1/2 a table.  then double it.  or like your said side plus side plus end plus end."
politics,ffay8ep,t3_esjteo,1579747258.0,"So after the Republican all vote in favor of Trump, then what?  We just go about business as usual?
I think this will prove that a bunch of imposters reside in the Senate.  The people of the United States of America should forcibly remove these imposters and take back what belongs to them.  We pay for it; it belongs to us.  We just let them use it so long as they swear on the Constitution to do their job and listen to their constituents.  You violate that oath.  You're gone.

So what's the plan?"
therewasanattempt,fedn4vi,t3_eogsjq,1579015567.0,I believe it's Na because it comes from German word Natrium.
YouShouldKnow,fe6ocpm,t3_enq572,1578898021.0,i do that for my dog while I'm out shopping.  It calms her hearing some noise.  And I don't have to worry about the video ending and the computer going to sleep.
NintendoSwitch,fe3vkve,t1_fe0kqnf,1578853242.0,also the controller for it was much better.  it was round instead and rectangular. and the buttons were at a little but of an angle.  i wish they had released that one since the beginning.  so much frustration would have never been.
NintendoSwitch,fe0kqnf,t1_fe0gtwv,1578815140.0,Honestly it was better.  I never had a problem with a game playing in it.  Games that wouldn't play in the original nes played just fine in the top loader.
linux,fdjgay6,t3_elc5cy,1578469550.0,"I wish they would always use three groups of digits for releases.  e.g. 72.0.0, just like they do for every other release.  

I'm just lazy and I don't want to update my buggy web automatic script."

ANormalDayInRussia,fd2tpbh,t1_fd2scox,1578151556.0,ok.  I'll believe it.  They do look similar to some on Gucci's website.
ANormalDayInRussia,fd2pe60,t1_fd2olof,1578150430.0,The purse shows LV.  The bag says Louis Vuitton.  I'm not sure how they got Gucci.
IdiotsInCars,fcr5g3p,t3_eihs8a,1577897047.0,That sign.  The people that speed probably don't have kids.  Who thought of that?
aww,fcqymjf,t1_fcq0tk1,1577894174.0,"Cat allergies are twice as common per webmd.  The room air is filtered first so that's probably fine.  The cat dander left from him/her running around will cause tightness in my throat.  If I touch anywhere the cat touches, I'll start itching and turning red.  
I had a hotel room with a previous cat stay.  It was awful.  I had to switch rooms.  After the switch, I was fine.  Maybe there were cats in the halls, maybe not.  I do not know.  The point is if you can prevent someone from having a ruined day, please do so."
Unexpected,fcppqll,t1_fcoyeay,1577869481.0,Thank you!  That's what it looked like to me.  Nice to have it confirmed.
aww,fcpn9a6,t3_eibuq1,1577867974.0,"Please don't.  Some people like me are allergic to cats, and I really do enjoy being able to breathe.  The cat is rubbing against the walls and probably leaving dander all over.  This is like my nightmare because I'd have to move to another place."

aww,fc4w903,t1_fc4v5tc,1577431009.0,They never said what the cat lays.  Maybe the cat lays bricks or something.
therewasanattempt,fc28bvk,t3_efh0ro,1577345220.0,Wow.  So many comments here.  I think there are over a brazilian comments.

Fixed that for you.  Remember when dealing with numbers the largest goes first then each smaller unit there after.

Example.  hour, minute, second.  Also, year, month, day."
