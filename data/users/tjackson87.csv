milwaukee,ff71o3t,t3_es0aeu,1579639352.0,The squash curry at EE-Sane is really good. The panang curry at Mekong is also really good.
milwaukee,ff6lgl0,t1_ff6hihh,1579629723.0,Totally. Gateway is a good way to think about it.
predaddit,ff6cmda,t3_erwonm,1579624276.0,We got travel insurance because my wife was around 30 weeks when we were supposed to fly to Thailand for a wedding. I didn't even read the policy. We ended up not going and had a doctor write a not saying they don't recommend flying. We got a full refund with no effort. I doubt they will waste their time fighting with someone pregnant with twins.

milwaukee,ff34rn3,t1_ff2be30,1579533656.0,"But I could pay $6 (or less) to get anything from any of the amazing breweries in town, or any other craft brewery. $5-$6 is the normal price for most beers at Sugar Maple or Roman's too, where you will be able to choose from dozens of beers that are all better than Blue Moon or Spotted Cow (Roman's even has a sign that says ""no spotted cow. Not now, not ever"")."
milwaukee,ff14xiy,t3_er116g,1579475227.0,"I really don't understand the obsession with blue moon or spotted cow. They are a step up from Miller lite, but are way overpriced for what they are. They are mass produced craft beers on training wheels at the same price as good craft beer. The only time I would ever choose one is if my only other choice is Miller lite or lesser."

WTF,fe9u9sc,t3_eo613a,1578941487.0,I always find it strange when people cheer for farm animals that are escaping slaughter or captivity and then continue to pay for those animals to be slaughtered and captured.
tippytaps,fdzd58b,t1_fdyvtxh,1578789073.0,Such an edgelord.
tippytaps,fdyr6gd,t1_fdy3f9a,1578782767.0,And? So it's okay to enslave dolphins because it's shit to be in the wild too? So enlightened you are.

tippytaps,fdx6mp7,t1_fdw2wxe,1578765853.0,"Obviously there are examples to the contrary, but you are literally on Reddit right now doing what you want."
tippytaps,fdw1fif,t1_fdtvg48,1578754097.0,"People can change their religion or country, or go get land and provide for themselves (lots of people still do this in Montana where we lived). Again, agency is the key. We have choices. They may be limited because we were born at a certain time and place, but all creatures have to do the labor required to survive. The dolphin will be forced to spend it's entire life in a tiny box that it can never leave where it can never make a decision for itself, and it will be forced to do things for the pleasure of the humans that had the freewill to come pay to watch it do tricks."
tippytaps,fdr2bmb,t1_fdqttem,1578678524.0,"Agency is the key distinction. Once humans are adults, they can fuck off and do whatever they want, and the only ones forcing humans to do anything are their parents, who typically are doing it for their well being  Animals don't get to make a choice ever, and humans are making the decisions for them for the humans' pleasure."
