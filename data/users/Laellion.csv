FragileWhiteRedditor,fdllwm7,t1_fdll8il,1578526985.0,"I'M FUCKING BISEXUAL YOU CREAM MUFFIN. If it doesn't add anything to the character, why mention it? You wouldn't mention a character being straight would you? Because it's not relevant. Making it suddenly relevant doesn't make us feel special or appreciated, itbmakes us feel different and alienated and it doesn't help. Dr Who is literally a family show, why is it talking about the characters sexual habits? At no point does it become relevant, or anything other than a cheap joke. 

Also statistically speaking being bisexual, gay, transsexual etc IS abnormal, even though that is not what I said. The majority of people are straight. Therefore anything other than being heterosexual is outside the norm, and therefore abnormal. By definition. All abnormal means is ""not normal"". If it were normal half the population would be bisexual, and much as I wish that were the case, it isn't.

Perhaps being bisexual doesn't need justification, but then why is it even mentioned? Mentioning it is like in some way it is being justified, as if it needs justification. It adds nothing and just makes the attempt at inclusion feel cheap. We would quite like to be treated as you would a ""normal"" person, not some special sub class.

Maybe don't argue the merits of including a token gay, to someone who actually is gay. We didn't ask for it, and frankly the pandering is annoying and detracts from shows which would otherwise flow (as a narative) much more convincingly."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdkmobo,t1_fdkg9cy,1578506739.0,"Yes, exactly. It makes absolutely no sense for the gods of a 4000 year old native-black nation, surrounded by other native black nations would have had black gods, and they should be cast as such."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdkgxrk,t1_fdk0vry,1578503645.0,"But the witcher IS based on medieval europe (specifically poland). Because that is where the author is from. If you read the books it is clear that that is what it is based around. And in the context of the basis of the book it doesn't make sense to have a black man in the royal court (or an eskimo, or a Chinese man etc). It also doesn't make sense in the world of the witcher because there is nowhere in the lore that would explain his being there (in medieval europe)"
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdkg80l,t1_fdj1tey,1578503210.0,"The point he was making is that every character should have a backstory to explain who they are. That's just good writing. This doesn't necessarily have to apply to the race of a character, or the sex, or the sexuality. 
Partly it's a rational of ""deviation from the norm"". Deviation from the average has to have a reason, or the world feels incomplete.

 For instance (from the point of view of a Bisexual): Bill (peter capaldi's last dr who companion) being a lesbian added absolutely nothing to the story and it would have been better left out. It wasn't developed or expanded on, and it felt cheap. They made it very clear that she was a lesbian, but gave it very little significance other than it being mentioned occasionally. I didn't like her as a companion, and would much rather have had a straight character (male or female) instead. Because then you don't have to explain their sexuality, because it wouldn't even be mentioned. World building has to be done carefully and every decision should be significant. Deviation from what is ""normal"" for the lore of a show will stand out, especially if it is mentioned in dialogue, so it has to be thoughly reasoned."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdkepio,t1_fdjqsdt,1578502290.0,"It is set around medieval european nobility. They may not actually be real members of a noble court, but that is what the books are based on. They are written by a polish author, and set in what is essentially an alternative Europe. Having an Indian (for instance) as a member of the royal family, or in the show at all is not faithful to the source, or the lore of the series - let alone actual historical events. Europeans reaching india (again, as an example) won't happen, if the dates are comparable, for another 250yrs.

In fantasy there is established lore, often prior to an adaptation. Things you have to accept (like their being magic). But that doesn't mean you can get away with anything ""because its fantasy"". Breaking established lore and characters is still often immersion breaking (unless done extremely well). I thought the witcher's casting was overblown personally, as I think most did a good job. I was most concerned about henry cavel playing geralt for exactly the same reason I initially questioned the other casting choices.

If you really want an example of ""token minorities"" watch a few episodes of the new series of dr who. Where the companions have no personality other than being from *insert nationality here* and it's extreemly wearing. They don't create conflict, so there is no story, because they are there purely to fill BBC quotas. They have managed to make a show with an amazing concept dull to watch. Its lazy writing and a poor attempt to represent minorities effectively in media. It's not helping anyone."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdkdd9w,t1_fdizp5w,1578501489.0,"And this isn't racist to say this. Casting is an important part of the production (slightly less than actual tallent, but it does matter). And when several major characters are replaced by someone who looks nothing like described, its starts to look a lot like pandering, and nobody wants that. Not the fans of the books, the game, or the people they are trying to represent. I certainly don't want to see an actor that has the same colour skin as me crammed into as show, just because of the colour of their skin. 

It's incredibly obvious with shows like Dr Who, that this is what the BBC was trying to do. You end up with too many characters, that don't have any real defining characteristics or traits, because they have just been crowbarred in at the last minute with very little actual thought as to, for instance, what traits they have aside from being black, or white, or Indian, or Mexican. It makes the show worse. Because none of the current companions actually has a personality, so they can't generate conflict, and can't progress the story. It's bad production practice and it's a terrible business decision.

Edit: you wouldn't cast a real person as a different race, so why would you do it to a fictional one? Especially in a series like the witcher which already deals with race exceptionally well (with the persecution of ""monsters"". Its insulting to the original works to imply that it didn't ""do race well enough""."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdkc3y5,t1_fdh2plm,1578500736.0,"Statistically speaking this does have some truth. As women tend to be shorter than men. So it may be reasonable to say *most* women would need to use a *shorter* sword. Sword length is based mainly on your height. The weight of the blade is misleading. It is also true that women tend to have lower upper body strength. So again a *smaller* sword would be a reasonable conclusion. However it is also true that there are a significant number of women with far greater upper body strength than the average man, and would have no problem at all with a full-size greatsword. Saying women can't use a sword is fucking ridiculous. About as ridiculous as claiming that all men can use a sword like Geralt of fucking Rivia.

Last time I checked viking women fought alongside the men and often out-ranked them."
