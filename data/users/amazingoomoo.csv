AskReddit,ffla41o,t3_eu0agw,1580036932.0,"I was asked “what is your biggest failure and how did you deal with it?” I talked about a major car accident I had, where I wrote off my car and a petrol station. I said it taught me that other people are unpredictable and it shook my confidence in myself. I made sure to drive more carefully and more considerately. It taught me a valuable lesson and it made me a safer driver."

IRLEasterEggs,ffdtxk7,t1_ffdts1o,1579828839.0,I mean yeah but it was to hide shit from my parents who never actually looked at my computer anyway because they actually had their own lives. My teenage self was too self-absorbed to realise they didn’t care.

The venue told us it was their first same-sex marriage and even the general manager came and found us beforehand and told us how excited they all were to embrace change and they were truly honoured that we had chosen them. He made it very clear that everything was to be perfect. They really pulled out all the stops. Incredible work.

I dunno why you’re all disagreeing. Both people can be driving badly. Just because the black car did something extremely dangerous and illegal doesn’t mean that the truck driver was right to leave it until the last fraction of a second. Less drastic measures could have been taken earlier. This is a fact. If the truck driver was paying attention, anyway."
NewProductPorn,fethw6y,t1_fehjboz,1579375609.0,People aren’t explaining it to you very well. We see a continuous pencil because these pencils are long and the same all the way down.

I know you aren’t expecting anyone to behave like that on the road but the point is that a driver should be ready for anything. If I saw a car stopped where a car should not be, I would always slow down and observe around me to assess the situation. This is appalling driving from the car, but not great from the truck either."

IdiotsInCars,feq5rty,t1_feoypn8,1579338044.0,"Or he could’ve taken evasive manoeuvres earlier - there was no need to swerve so drastically so late. If he had seen this much earlier which he really should’ve done, he could’ve avoided much less dramatically"
IdiotsInCars,feq5jfw,t1_feoyfjf,1579337929.0,Sorry I don’t understand. From where I’m watching it looks like he could and should have seen that far sooner and taken action earlier. He left it until the last second.
