depressionregimens,fdxwt6i,t3_en75l8,1578773740.0,"It never specifically made things worse for me in terms of depression as a primary effect. However the side effect of significant weight gain had a secondary effect of body image issues, which did in turn effect my depression. It's actually the only antidepressant I've taken that really made a positive change in my mood, and I've taken a lot of different SSRI's. It did also totally screw up my memory and focus for the long term, it still effects me now and I came off it years ago."
