PrequelMemes,fgi4of4,t1_fgi49yx,1580805372.0,"If your saying the feminism in the sequels was sexist, I'd agree with you, because it was definitely sexist against women. The first movie made Rey share main character screentime with Finn, and narratively gave her no opportunities to be a real character or make decisions. TLJ didn't really treat her as anything more than a confused girl with many people yelling at her, and TRoS made her powers come from grandpa, forced her into a relationship with her abuser, and handed her a bullshit victory that clearly belonged to said abuser. Her character was treated like shit and honestly the movies would have been better if she wasn't there, but even better if she was treated right."

She could be unreasonably overpowered and it would only really put her on the level of Crystal Skull, Survived A Nuclear Explosion In A Fridge Indy. Like, watching old as fuck Indy try to keep up with Lara Croft, who is by all means an overpowered badass circa Angelina Jolie, would be fun as long as they occasionally let Indy demonstrate that being an archeological hero means Historical Knowledge > Fighting Ability"
