Now the teeth are still being pushed forward and did shift a bit but only a fraction of what it was (it's just 3-4 mm at best) and stopped shifting. I guess teenage body has a lot more plasticity than adult body, hence the ""braces as a teen not as an adult"" thing."

insaneparents,ff3nmob,t1_ff3acwq,1579544914.0,"Funny thing is that trumps takes pride in the stock market because it's going very well, when it's a sector where robo-traders are extremely common.

bestof,fep8q57,t1_feo5utr,1579314652.0,"It also makes sense that so many incels/right wing guys fantasize about ""The Past"". If you look at books from the 50's/60's about good manners for example, you find passages like this:

>""If you travel under the escort of a gentleman, give him as little trouble as possible; at the same time, do not interfere with the arrangements he may make for your comfort. It is best, when starting upon your journey, to hand your escort a sufficient sum of money to cover all your expenses,retaining your pocket book in case you should wish to use it.""   

>""Volubility is to be avoided; to overpower with a volley of words is more cruel than kind; the words should be gently spoken not drawled, the voice loud enough to be caught easily, but always in an undertone to the power of voice alloted by nature"".

>""Have dinner ready. Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious meal ready, on time for his return. This is a way of letting him know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about his needs"".

>""You may have a dozen important things to tell him, but the moment of his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first — remember, his topics of conversation are more important than yours"".

>""Make the evening his. Never complain if he comes home late or goes out to dinner, or other places of entertainment without you. Instead, try to understand his world of strain and pressure and his very real need to be at home and relax"".

All these paint a world where men are the center of the world of women and where they are expected to be the all powerful rulers and women mere serfs to execute their desires (whichever those may be). They basically are considered living appliances whose sole purpose is to serve men and whatever wishes they may have are relegated to the far back, crushed by the requirement of obeying the wishes of ""Man"".   

It's basically an incel's wet dream. In a situation like this they'd suddenly be desirable center-of-the-attention adonises where getting the attention of the opposite sex and getting what you want from it is as simple as scratching your ear. No wonder so many fantasize about ""the past"" and want its customs to go back."

By their nature explosive eruptions are much more destructive than effusive ones (effusive eruptions are like the ones in Hawaii, explosive eruptions are like the St Helens's) because they also cause pyroclastic flows, which are just extremely dense superheated clouds of gas and volcanic ash that move at supersonic speeds. Those can radiate far and wide (at distances that can exceed 100 km) and unlike lava flows that usually rapidly slow down to one or two km/h due to cooling and who can be deviated with dams or just by digging canals for it to flow, whith pyroclastic flows all you can do is not be in the way.

They don't realize that. They just seem to want to watch it grow. Then after a time they just glance at it once in a while. Pretty soon they don't even notice it.  Then one day something comes along and takes that child away, and they wonder why! Start throwing blame around 1like... like Frisbees! It's the rock lyrics! Violence on TV! Sex in the movies!

 There's parents who just view kids like glorified furniture that will just take care of itself. And then one day shit happens and their prized possession has become vegan and is eating the grass roots first (if you catch my drift). But can those parents actually say :""It's my fault, I fucked up, I should've done better.""? Nope. Because it'd involve admitting they didn't listen to their kid. And so instead they blame anything they can think of, burying their heads in the sand.

The U.S. are jollyly going to war with a considerably better organized and capable country with pretty much none of the support it had before. For short it's a disaster even before it ""started properly"" . Let's also not forget that the U.S. economy is on the decline lately under the current administration and an open conflict would strain it even further.

todayilearned,fd8rw99,t1_fd7pm9s,1578222534.0,"I'm hoping it will as well.  It'd benefit so many people (folks with bruxism, people who have been in accidents and lost teeth, etc...)"
AskReddit,fd6szve,t3_ejyp0c,1578195339.0,"I'm italian, talk with my hands a ton and eat a buttload of pasta.

So ye, am the stereotype."
AskReddit,fd6rqsu,t3_ejwdpo,1578194909.0,"Interestingly the most ridiculous one I ever heard was a US town's name.   

I got a documentary on DVD about tornadoes/hurricanes in the U.S. (in Italian) and throughout said doc the narrator would constantly talk about a city called Mayeni. I was thoroughly confused as it sounded extremely Japanese and to my knowledge no such town exists.   

After several viewings I realized the narrator was talking about *Miami*.  Basically he'd take the U.S. english accent and it'd end up cobbled with the italian one he naturally had resulting in this weird pronunciation."
todayilearned,fd6h4a1,t1_fd63u6u,1578190929.0,"Yep. It's poison to kill cancer before cancer kills you. Can't wait for a vaccine against cancer tbh, it'd have spared me that (and my chemo was light)."
todayilearned,fd6gvxb,t1_fd608p5,1578190825.0,IIRC there's lab tests done lately that allowed teeth to grow back (in animals though ). Such treatment would be the dream cure for that poor guy.
insaneparents,fd65bl0,t1_fd32w56,1578185736.0,"You're joking but that's something kids with crazy parents do sometimes. They basically go like ""It doesn't matter if I did it or didn't, I'll get punished anyways so might as well do it for real."""
Warframe,fd5kbwu,t1_fd2dtsv,1578178461.0,"Same here ^^
Every now and then I go on Mercury/Venus specifically for that :D"
skyrim,fd5ilxq,t1_fd3yfrh,1578177974.0,"That mod is a-we-some.
You have a buttload of different starts too. You can start as a bandit, right off the bat as a thief or in the Dark Brotherhood, as a patron in an inn and more.

I use it to make different playthroughs and just generally spice things up ^^"
skyrim,fd2ih82,t1_fd22rvj,1578147722.0,The tone also makes me think of Samuel Hayden from 2016's Doom. We're here to resoooooolve Tamriel's dragon problem after all :P
ZBrush,fd2fzr5,t1_fcvyyqi,1578146682.0,Maybe it's OP's sleep paralysis demon ?
AskReddit,fcxcqi6,t1_fcw36l5,1578059368.0,IIRC in the behind the scenes for Terminator 2 they showed that by firing an AK loaded with blanks at a polystyrene head. A few rounds shot at it caused the head to fold quite significantly onto itself under the force of the gas
gifs,fcvohx0,t1_fcvlpm0,1578006542.0,"Yep, that sounds very much like it. I'm not versed enough in Australian politics to name the Aussie equivalent to him though."
gifs,fcvdzpr,t1_fctwh68,1578000115.0,"Basically imagine if a surface of 5 times the one of California is on fire and the only ones fighting the largely out od control blaze are volunteer firefighters. Said blaze is also so bad because Trump massively underfunded the agency managing the forests. Then, when the shit's really burning up everywhere and he gets the blame for it (rightfully so), he'd go like ""This is not the right time to discuss it"", and then leave on vacation with Melania and his kids to Mar-a-Lago, after having specifically instructed White House spokepersons to lie when questioned about is whereabouts, only to return one day before the planned end of the vacation (following a massive outcry) and claim that he returned as soon as he could even though he went to Mar-a-Lago in his private jet, meaning he'd have been able to return home within 24 hours of the disaster.   

Before all this imagine that Trump had been repatedly warned about the possibility of a disaster of this scale and that action had to be taken to prevent it only for Trump to do nothing as his Evangelican Christian beliefs make him believe that these events will only bring Armageddon closer and said disaster would benefit his coal mining/fracking friends anyways.   

So basically from my understanding he's a blend of Mike Pence and Trump with some Pat Robertson sprinkled on top."
worldnews,fcuur1u,t1_fcu1qas,1577988928.0,">They'd probably hang him like a traitor

Honestly it ain't too late to do just that yo him anyways. As far as I'm concerned the people who died in the fires perished due to his inaction."
pcmasterrace,fcufnjh,t1_fcu61hi,1577979816.0,As a WF vet I just love doing that. It reminds me of the time I had just started playing the game all the way back in 2013 :')
