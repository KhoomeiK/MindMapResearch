His followers aren't smart enough to tell from a real vs a fake Elon account. They don't even know what the verification symbol means."

agedlikewine,fcxlgt8,t1_fcxh4ex,1578065800.0,The tweet doesn't say that it was about to happen either. It was suggesting that there is a small chance of it happening. That's why you're getting downvoted.

I go to church every week and we bring this up during Bible lessons all the time. To be completely honest with you, I don't see much Christianity in the Republican party. Why hate they gays? They're your brothers and sisters. Why hoard wealth when Jesus asked his followers to give it away?

Edit: seriously? No answers? I was honestly really looking forward to finding a common interest with you guys.."

UNIFI,fcmhyg5,t1_fcmhbvh,1577775985.0,You were right.  It is an auditorium. Unfortunately budgeting wonâ€™t allow for more APâ€™s. I could only get the board to approve me one AP. Being an AC-HD or an AC-Pro. I went with the HD.
videosurveillance,fcmarut,t1_fcm7zml,1577768956.0,"Yeah licensing is definitely a pain, though luckily itâ€™s a one time purchase. It wasnt difficult to setup at all and itâ€™s pretty straight forward. All I did for the Hikvision cameras was set the IP and set streaming profile to ONVIF. Cameras connected perfectly. Flexibility wise, it looks like you get a pretty long list of cameras supported, though I havenâ€™t tested with anything outside of Hikvision to be honest. 

For a small business use or home use, I think itâ€™s a good buy."

Otherwise, cheap but effective solution!"
