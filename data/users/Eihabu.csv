Overwatch,ff6j8wf,t1_ff4vzg6,1579628377.0,"Well, gold kills without much total damage very likely means you're the one making the most effort to focus targets. But paragraph 4 explains the only caveat to that that I can think of.

Gold damage without many total kills means the rest of the team should be focusing the people weakened by all the damage you're putting out, and if they were mopping up you'd probably be on the move. You're doing more than anyone else to create targets that could be killed with a little focus. People really don't get high damage with no elims because they pick targets to blast randomly and not finish them off for the hell of it. Maybe a Reaper that keeps 80% killing the tanks before ghosting out or a Widow landing bodyshots, and they keep doing it even after it's obvious it's not working? That's the only case I can even imagine where it might be the gold damage person's fault that the damage isn't resulting in kills. But even then the fact that that's doing more damage than anyone else in the team can still says a lot about the team.

If you have gold damage *and* gold kills and you're stuck, the rest of the team probably isn't doing jack shit. You're the only one weakening the targets *and* finishing them off and the team still can't move. And if the team are being a bunch of dickwads complaining about picks instead of focusing on actually playing, that's a pretty good sign they don't have a good mindset anyway. It's tough for anyone to do anything like that. Do people throw with picks? Sure, but I've seen just as many people throw by bitching about it for 4 whole minutes instead of giving it a real shot. And when the team does try to work together instead of bickering nonstop, ""bad"" choices still quite often tend to work.

Gold kills is, of course, less meaningful than gold damage, since your damage only tracks your personal damage output, whereas everyone gets a point for a kill even if all they did was step on the deceased enemy's toe a few minutes ago. So you *can* get gold kills without really doing anything. So if a Torb has gold kills but no damage medal just because the turret is occasionally tapping enemies the other teammates are doing the real work on, that doesn't count for anything.

That's where if you really want to be technical about it, it matters *how many* people have the medals for elims. If the whole team assists a single kill then all 6 people can have gold elims at 1. In the rare case that someone has 3 gold elims and nobody else even has a medal, it's definitely the team that's trash and not '3 gold elims' guy. But more likely in that scenario he's not even the only one with gold at 3. In which case it is relevant again how much damage he and everyone else are putting out to see who's most at fault.

If somebody can actually prove the reasoning here invalid I'd unironically love to hear how. As best as I can tell, the only time where gold medals *might* be meaningless in terms of deciding who's working hardest is if you have gold elims and weak damage. And then whether or not gold elim is meaningless depends on how many people also have golds and how big the gap is between gold and silver: the player *could* be the only one with a medal for elims at all, in which case the scenario is probably that they're just not able to carry a team that *really* is shit at working together, despite being the least shitty member of the team."
Overwatch,ff4f9bi,t1_ff4eo4u,1579562204.0,"Golds aren't proof you're doing awesome, but they *are* evidence that the team has it wrong if they're *singling out* the person that has them as the supposed problem.

There aren't very many conditions where DPS B is doing more damage than DPS A, and DPS B deserves the whole team yelling at them and only them. The shitty thing about the dynamic here is how it incentivizes whoever starts bitching first the most: if you're DPS B in this scenario and you see DPS A isn't doing as much as you, start shitting on them and then nobody is going to be complaining about you and claiming golds don't mean anything. Be the toxic shithead first and 9 times out of 10 that means you won't be the target... unless your voice is just that annoying to everyone, most people will tend to just side up with whoever starts bitching first when they aren't winning.

And there very well are plenty of circumstances where that DPS B sees that a switch might be useful, but they know they can capture a point if people will work with their upcoming ult much faster than if they start over as something else. Even if it doesn't work, that doesn't mean it wasn't the best option to bet on."

As far as being literate in audio circles goes, everyone kind of uses terms in their own way, so even though someone can give you a proper definition, you can't be 100% sure what a given reviewer means. Or what objective property of the headphone actually explains the thing they're describing about what they hear. For one person ""crisp"" could mean cymbals come through with a lot of air around them, for another it could mean an elevated midrange that makes it easier to hear fine details in the vocals. In general, the more obscure the writing is, the less trustworthy it is whether you know the terminology or not. When they can break down tracks and point to specific things they notice, that's better all around for anyone, and there's not too much barrier to an average person off the street comprehending what they mean when they do that either. So I'd say only a tiny part of the problem here was you. For the most part, writing that laymen can't comprehend is just bad writing. 

The only consistent descriptions you can rely on for sure as meaning something tangible are ""bright"" or ""analytical"" vs ""warm"" or ""dark."" Analytical means ""too bright for my tastes"" and dark means ""too warm for my tastes."" You probably have a preference in whether you like headphones that are brighter or warmer than average, and figuring that out will save you a lot of time. Don't trust paid reviews from major review websites unless it's slightly older stuff from Inner Fidelity (one of the best reviewers ever retired a year or so ago).

The best bang for your buck in terms of sheer resolution is to find a used HD800. It's very bright/analytical though. There are a couple of mods that don't take too much work that will go a long way to tame the *extreme* brightness, and then if you put a touch of EQ on that (I recommend the Peace GUI for Equalizer APO) you can get it sounding as good as $2000+ setups for less than half that. It still has a unique way of presenting the sound though that may or may not be to your tastes. Try to at least demo it if you get the chance.

As someone who's spent $2k on headphones, and considers them worth every single penny, amps and DACs make very little difference except in extreme circumstances, and I'd put the extra money into a headphone over a DAC/amp every time. Most of what they're doing is just applying a slight EQ that nudges the sound in a direction you like. You can do that for free with software if you learn a little bit about what you're doing though. The only exception is tube amps, which add a specific, controlled form of distortion that makes music sound better, that you can't mimic with EQ (although software could *theoretically* do it...)"

## Abstract

The number of studies showing adverse effects on living organisms induced by different types of man-made Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) has increased tremendously. Hundreds of peer reviewed published studies show a variety of effects, the most important being DNA damage which is linked to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive declines etc. Those studies that are far more effective in showing effects employ real-life Mobile Telephony (MT) exposures emitted by commercially available mobile phones. The present review - of results published by my group from 2006 until 2016 - compares DNA fragmentation induced by six different EMFs on the same biological system - the oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster - under identical conditions and procedures. Such a direct comparison between different EMFs - especially those employed in daily life - on the same biological endpoint, is very useful for drawing conclusions on their bioactivity, and novel. It shows that real MT EMFs are far more damaging than 50 Hz alternating magnetic field (MF) - similar or much stronger to those of power lines - or a pulsed electric field (PEF) found before to increase fertility. The MT EMFs were significantly more bioactive even for much shorter exposure durations than the other EMFs. Moreover, they were more damaging than previously tested cytotoxic agents like certain chemicals, starvation, dehydration. Individual parameters of the real MT EMFs like intensity, frequency, exposure duration, polarization, pulsing, modulation, are discussed in terms of their role in bioactivity. The crucial parameter for the intense bioactivity seems to be the extreme variability of the polarized MT signals, mainly due to the large unpredictable intensity changes."
headphones,feo8no2,t1_feo6ah0,1579296651.0,"Well, I have to admit I'm not great at reading this stuff either. I also wouldn't count on Inner Fidelity having gotten perfectly representative pairs - take a look at their LCD-4 shootout, which they noted later turned out to have used a very unrepresentative pair that skewed their results. Of course, it's also possible any number of pairs I heard could have been unrepresentative as well: my Rev2 could have been especially good, my 2C could have had an issue.

All I'm certain of is that there's a certain sound in the LCD-X I heard that I could never bring myself to appreciate, even as someone that loved the LCD-3 and LCD-4. As soon as I plugged in the 2C, I recognized that same signature immediately, which leads me to think it's *one of* the house sounds and not a random fluke. I'd take my old Rev2 over the LCD-X I've heard any day, and my 2C sounded more like the latter than the former.

If you got a new 2C, then you got an LCD2 with full warranty near the used price. If you like that sound, it's not a bad deal at all, and maybe you wouldn't even like the 'magic' of the Rev2. But if they were really making a serious effort to replicate the Rev2, I'm not sure why it would even be difficult to make the FRs line up perfectly – that's what you're aiming for every single time you mass produce a headphone after all, making headphones that are indistinguishable from one another thousands and thousands of times in a row. To come out and say you're 'rereleasing the classic' should imply that you've got that process down pat.

I've also seen a number of people who owned Rev2s talk about the 2C not sounding like what they hoped, so I'm not the only one. In general I think a lot of 2C buyers were people that heard of but never actually got a chance or took the risk of hearing one of the old ones. It might be a better headphone than past Rev2 owners want to give it credit for, since they weren't able to appreciate it on its own terms like people coming in fresh could."

And I said, correctly, that you tried it before looking at other substances with real evidence behind them, like the one you're turning down right now.

>You've never thought to consider that being slowed down and relaxed, like with Skullcap, can be equally as beneficial in certain circumstances.

In my original comment, I said, ""anxiolytics can boost performance specifically in people with anxiety problems because they help address those...""

>As for Mucuna Pruriens, I was using it to replenish the dopamine I'll be lacking after quitting kratom/ balance myself and my depression.

Yeah, and this is a problem. You're mainly experiencing an opioid withdrawal coming off of kratom. And boosting dopamine above where it would be - if your biochemistry allows you to succeed - just means you've got another thing to rebalance from later, or you're putting off the re-balancing you should be experiencing now. This mindset *really is not different* from someone taking a few lines of coke to get through painkiller withdrawals. Or binge eating while they quit smoking. Maybe it's not that extreme, but it is a miniature version of the same thing. It's not a healthy way to handle it and it suggests an underlying issue.

>I don't have an addictive personality for one

I'm telling you, you need to re-evaluate that belief. Not everyone who tries kratom ends up hooked on it. Not everyone likes it enough, or misses it enough on their days off of it, to make even an innocent decision to take it every day and then get hooked accidentally. The fact that you *did get hooked on it and it's now taking you effort to get off of it* is precisely the proof you *do* have at least some ""addictive personality."" And the fact that you're looking to other substances to try to feel great while you withdraw and getting pessimistic because they aren't working is more evidence for that.

Friendo, I'm commenting here because I've seen a lot of people go down dark paths, and have experienced some of the temptation myself. And what I'm seeing here is clear evidence of a mindset I've *seen* slide that way over time. Believing you ""don't have an addictive personality"" and therefore don't have to worry about it too much is actually a very bad sign. It's similar to how someone who is in a real psychotic episode usually isn't going to ask themselves if they might be going crazy, whereas someone who actually *is* sane will. It's the person who recognizes that addiction is a real threat that *they* could fall prey to if they don't stay vigilant who is most likely to  stay clear of it, and the one minimizing the chance of it seriously affecting them who's most at risk.

No shit, there are reasons why people latch on to substances in attempts to self-medicate. I know that as well as anyone. I get it, man. But if that's what you're doing, and it *still* is *exactly* what it sounds like, then the kind of help that would actually help you right now isn't a nootropic. That isn't the nootropics' fault, you don't need to walk away resenting the nootropic industry and forums, you need to spend some time focusing on getting a grip on what it is you're trying to medicate. That might require exactly the opposite of a noticeably ""boosted"" state of consciousness."
Nootropics,fei63d8,t1_fei2d31,1579131102.0,"You absolutely *shouldn't* be looking to notice an altered state of consciousness. That mentality is why you're getting yourself addicted to kratom, which is just an opioid,  and ironically harming your dopaminergic system with L-DOPA. You're picking things that are most likely to give you subjective feelings you want instead of things backed by research to improve cognitive functioning. I'm not making assumptions, I'm addressing a legitimate issue with the way you're obviously approaching these things, which you're admitting to.

Whether something has a measurable impact on your memory, executive functioning, etc. is 100% a separate issue from whether you can ""tell that you're on it"" while you're on it by the way you feel. You need objective tests of your reaction speed, recall ability, and so on in order to even *gauge that* at all. If you aren't performing those tests, you don't even have a clue whether your own N=1 suggests these things were placebo for you. This really isn't how you'd respond to the suggestion of bacopa (again, the research behind it is substantial) if your original question was sincere. You're trying L-DOPA and kratom before considering one of the most well-researched substances we have and then trying to go to a forum to claim they're all placebo instead of re-evaluating the mindset that's giving you these results.

Trying to address a chronic deficit in how they *feel* is *exactly* why people end up addicted to drugs. Nootropics are substances that enhance cognitive functioning in tests. Regarding modafinil, the evidence it works as a cognitive enhancer per se is actually very inconsistent.

>There were no significant effects of modafinil compared with placebo in tests of long-term memory, executive function, visuospatial and constructional ability, or category fluency. These results suggest that the benefits of modafinil are not clearly dose-related, and those from 100 mg are limited to the span of immediate verbal recall and short-term visual recognition memory, which is insufficient for it to be considered as a cognitive enhancer in non-sleep-deprived individuals. - ""Does modafinil enhance cognitive performance in young volunteers who are not sleep-deprived?""

Does it make any discernible difference to Justin Bieber's career whether he hits #1 or #3? I'm guessing no. For that matter, apart from up and coming artists hitting the 100 for the first time as a way to get their name out further, who even gives a fuck who makes the list at all?

Unless there's more evidence Bieber and/or team are suddenly desperate, I don't think this says anything. It's normal for anyone to share anything that praises their work, and ""You love this music? I love this music. I want to make sure how much we love it gets registered on the charts"" is, at a basic level, praise. 

It also doesn't seem it would achieve very *much* manipulation. Look, it isn't brainwashing anyone who *didn't* love the song to do this if they don't already feel inspired to because they actually liked it. Only someone who is already a diehard fan would even consider it. And the extreme diehard fans of other musicians are doing stuff like it too, so ""how many extreme hardcore fans does this musician have?"" actually might be a valid measurement for top charts to register. 

If a song could really inspire people to do this in large numbers in a way no other song could? I'd think that was pretty fucking incredible in its own right. Why do I care more or less about the sheer numbers of people casually playing a song, or the number of diehard fans that *really* love it? I don't care about either, but if I did, either one would seem just as worthy a measurement of how ""popular"" something is to me. Does a hardcore fan's extreme enjoyment of a song count 200x as much as someone mindlessly playing it in the car who doesn't even know the lyrics to the chorus? I don't see why it shouldn't.

You opened the thread saying there was, quote, ""no evidence"" that there is any link between B vitamins and cancer. That was a dead false statement. It's incorrect. It's not true. However you want to reframe your argument or your position now, that was the point you led in and have presumably been defending since. Well, it's just not the case. It's extremely misleading. As in, it would mislead people into thinking things that are not the truth, because it's a lie. There's a very significant amount of evidence; enough to compel whole nations to decide against promoting supplementation. That evidence involves both mechanism and population-wide correlations, and it's the exact same kind of evidence by which we conclude smoking causes cancer.

You didn't present the state of affairs honestly. And yet, you skimmed the very studies in which these summaries were presented enough to find something you thought supported your counter-argument (when it did not support it at all). That's the definition of bad faith: looking straight over evidence against your assertions while searching for something to spin as support for them. You went looking for something to portray out of context as if it was a fatal flaw in the research while ignoring the big picture and making people think you're giving them a thorough summary. You said things that were proven more than false by paragraphs you skimmed straight over while looking for something to spin, just like you did when you responded like a smug jerk to my comments.

If the research turns out not to replicate some day, that's something else entirely. The replication crisis is only an argument against accepting this conclusion to the extent that it's an argument against using scientific research to support any conclusion at all.

I still want to make the underlying points here clear for anyone else reading or thinking about the topic or considering taking megadoses of B vitamins in the absence of a demonstrated need - since on some level peoples' lives and wellbeing are at stake. Anyone concerned can consider the following points for themselves, as it's pretty clear neither of us have anything further to contribute to this from here.

* Any discovery Y is ""evidence"" for any conclusion X if Y **raises** the probability that X is true compared to what it would have been had Y not been discovered by research.
* This research provides **evidence** that taking B vitamins increases one's risk of cancer. It **quite significantly** **raises** the probability that taking B vitamins increases one's risk of cancer **compared to what it would have been** had the correlation not been found.
* The existence of a confounding variable explaining the correlation away is **unlikely** for one big reason: people that engage in any one behavior that is perceived as healthy are known in every body of research to be more likely to engage in all others. We're dealing with large populations here, and when you're looking at hundreds of thousands of people the correlation between engaging in any one behavior perceived as healthy and any other is **very** strong. You can pick anything for this: say, you can look at people who take fish oil, and confirm that they're statistically more likely to practice yoga. People who jog are more likely to do resistance training. People who identify as vegetarian are more likely to try to cut down on processed food or practice meditation.
* **Healthy behaviors generally reduce one's risk of cancer. Right? Right!**
* There are therefore two possibilities here:

1. People that take B vitamins are a unique exception in all the world, violating an overwhelming trend found in **all** other people that engage in **any other behavior perceived as healthy whatsoever.** There is some cancer-promoting behavior that people taking B vitamins engage in **frequently** that people taking other vitamins or engaging in other healthy behaviors, quite strangely, do not. Whatever this mystery behavior is, its effect in promoting cancer is so strong that it overwhelms the benefits of their vitamin intake and all the *other* healthy behaviors they *do* engage in more often compared to average (which it is a given that they do, since all healthy behaviors correlate with each other). And taking B vitamin supplements is the only activity considered healthy by society for which something like this is the case, violating a trend that holds everywhere else. If you can't see why this is inherently implausible, all I can say is take your time reading slowly. It is inherently implausible. 
2. Taking megadoses of B vitamins contributes to one's risk of cancer.

* Just as we have a mechanism from smoke intake to lung inflammation backing up the correlation between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, leading us to the inexorable conclusion that smoking **causes** cancer without any demonstrable facts besides a strong correlation, the absence of identifiable confounders, and a plausible mechanism... so we have a mechanism by which intake of B vitamins could influence one's risk of cancer. **The studies linked to above even go into detail about them.** Quote, ""Folic acid and vitamin B12 play key roles in one-carbon metabolism. Disruption of one-carbon metabolism may be involved in the risk of cancer."" We have **both** a demonstrated correlation, **and** a strong body of evidence outlining a more than plausible mechanism by which megadosing B vitamins could play a causal role in cancer risk: via their effects on one-carbon metabolism. This, again, is exactly the nature of the evidence we have linking cigarette smoking to cancer.
* A reasonable person following the evidence would therefore conclude tentatively that it is very likely megadosing B vitamins contributes to one's risk of cancer - while keeping an open mind to the possibility that a confounding variable might be found one day, but *not* holding their breath or considering the existing evidence weak before this has actually been shown. This is what the other party to this conversation is doing. There is good *evidence* for a contribution to cancer risk from commercial B vitamin supplements here, no *evidence* for any third behavior people that take B vitamins engage in more than anyone else that increases their risk of cancer, and good reason grounded in research to think one won't be found: people that do one generally healthy thing tend to do a lot more other healthy things compared to the average. Those healthy things don't increase their risk of cancer compared to average, ***they reduce it.***"
Nootropics,fef7vkd,t1_fef5ckb,1579050264.0,"That's not a logical response.

*Megadoses of B vitamins contribute to cancer* is a hypothesis. You haven't even proposed a contrary hypothesis for us to match it against. ""There *could* be a confounder"" isn't a hypothesis, it's just having the idea that it *might be possible* to come up with one. There *could* be a confounder behind the correlation between smoking and lung cancer. So the fact that a confounder is theoretically possible is trivial. To have an argument worth making, you have to have some idea of confounding variables that would explain the connection if it held true, and some idea that the confounding variable could be shown to exist. What behavior do you think people that take B vitamins also engage in that explains why they're more likely to get cancer that the research didn't control for?

The original point I made was big reason why it's unlikely you'll even find a good hypothetical confounding variable to make a hypothesis out of: deciding to take vitamins is a ""healthy behavior."" The decision to engage in any one ""healthy behavior"" correlates heavily with the decision to engage in others. So we have some indication that vegetarianism *per se* doesn't improve your risk of disease that much: for instance, when we compare Seventh Day Adventists to Mormons who have equally strong social networks through their church as 7DAs do, and roughly the same health behaviors except Mormons eat meat and 7DAs do not, there's barely any discernible difference in health outcomes between the two. Yet, vegetarianism correlates with healthier outcomes and lower risks of disease in large part because people who decide to go vegetarian and label themselves as such are more health-conscious in general. Vegetarianism is perceived as a ""healthy behavior,"" and people who are attracted to one ""healthy behavior"" are attracted to the others.

To put this in plain language, it's obvious that people who take multivitamins are *more likely* than people who don't in the general population to also, say, try to cut down on processed food. By taking a multivitamin, they've signaled an interest in ""healthy behaviors,"" and that gives us plenty strong, evidence-backed reason to think they're also more likely to engage in others as well. This holds for all the ""healthy behaviors"" we've ever looked at.

Now, your original argument, and the only argument you've made, against the research suggesting a link is that the correlation only shows up in what you tried to imply was a select niche group of people. But that wasn't a select niche group of people - that was just the same people who have enough combined risk factors (including genes, which we know plays a significant role in mens' increased chance of cancer compared to women) to be at risk of cancer to begin with. So it's not a reason why we should expect to see confounding variables behind the association."

Anticholinergic effects are rare even at higher doses though, so I feel pretty safe taking half the lowest one. 

If you don't have a SAD light (using it in the AM boosts melatonin release at night too) or deep red blueblocking glasses (highly recommend the TrueDark Classics because they try to cover your eye from all angles instead of just sitting in front of your eye), those are probably worth the money first.

I also had positive results with that Delta Sleeper device that only pulses you *in* to a deep sleep state for 22 minutes and then shuts off.

If your problem is falling asleep, my top reccomendation would go to the SAD light plus dark red blueblockers, preferably TrueDark Twilight Classics imo. If it's waking up too early, the Delta Sleeper SR1 might work best. 

Earthpulse pulses an unnaturally strong field at you, and either stays stuck at 1 frequency all night or makes a lot of assumptions about your sleep architecture throughout the night. I've still yet to do true sleep tests, but my feeling is that that's more of a crapshoot if you'll luck out and it works for you or not.

 If you look at those studies (a meta-analysis applies statistical analysis to a large body of other research studies so many are discussed in here), it's clear that *some specific strains* of bacteria have strong evidence for reducing anxiety – while others don’t. The evidence for depression is similar: some help, others don’t. So there’s no guarantee you’ll reduce anxiety problems just by taking any probiotic you see in the store; you need to know the specific strains being used.

Nootropics,fe2uyvf,t1_fe1pe5a,1578843119.0,"The ""null"" study I was thinking of was [this pilot study from mid-'18](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijad/2018/6852303/#B5). Keep in mind that the result being measured is beta-amyloid plaque, and recent studies confirmed people start developing signs of Alzheimer's before the beta-amyloid plaque is accumulating, so it *may* be a side effect rather than the cause of the disease anyway. But then, it's even possible that a deficit of 40Hz production is closer to the root cause of the disease than the plaque, since we know the brain cleans that plaque out at 40Hz, and patients with Alzheimer's have more plaque and produce less 40Hz brainwaves. Cause and effect in Alzheimer's is really a mystery, and it's not clear if we're even measuring the right variable or not to test the effectiveness of entrainment.

[This blog](https://blog.szynalski.com/2018/03/40-hz-tone-alzheimers/) does a better job of summarizing the results of the research than I could, though. Apparently 40Hz soundwaves might reach the hippocampus, whereas 40Hz visual flicker probably doesn't. The hippocampus is where memories are actually formed, and the area that takes the most damage in Alzheimer's disease.

And yet another ""however"" caveat:

>The clicks were 10 kHz waves, 1 millisecond long, repeated 40 times a second (each cycle had a 1 ms tone followed by 24 ms of silence). In communication with me, one of the paper’s authors said that pure 40 Hz tones were not used because mice cannot hear tones of such a low frequency.

So auditory entrainment might be more effective than visual entrainment, but the pure 40Hz tones you get in brainwave entrainment tapes *might* not do the same thing at all. Every step along the way has a big ""maybe"" ...

In general, it looks like if it is effective, then the effectiveness stops rather quickly after treatment. So you *probably* aren't getting preventative benefits from doing this as a healthy person, if even progressed patients have to continue the treatment constantly for the benefits not to disappear. Practicing meditation is likely a better bet for a healthy person increasing the strength of their 40Hz brainwaves - specifically the ""metta"" or ""lovingkindness"" variety of meditation; others did *not* increase 40Hz waves."

The most rational form of this argument that I can try to put together would say something like, there are (let's say) black people that consciously sell out the interests of most black people just to make white friends - ""Uncle Toms"" - and the kinds of white people that make this argument are *only* friends with them, maybe even only friends with them as a means of undermining the interests of most black people.

But this argument is actually extremely condescending, and arguably racist itself. Those black individuals adamantly insist that that's not what they're doing, and that they genuinely hold their social or political beliefs because they sincerely think they're the most beneficial policies - just like everyone else. There are significant differences of opinion among white people. Well, there are significant differences of opinion among black people, and there are significant differences of opinion among Asians, and so on for everyone else. You can't make your opinions immune to critical discussion by just asserting that they're now ""the"" opinion of white, black, Asian, or any other people.

Actually, that's the case even if the opinion you're addressing *is* held by less than 50% of any of those groups. You can't just assert something this nefarious about someone's character and motivations to discredit their opinion. That's just [ad hominem](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ad-hominem) \- and unsubstantiated ad hominem at that, unless you actually have direct evidence for it from something *other than their opinions.*

LetsTalkMusic,fdswqjs,t1_fdsf2bc,1578708937.0,"This is the most correct answer IMO. I think the answer attributing it to the rhythm is off in terms of how most people are using the term. ""Catchy"" is short for something like the melody ""catching on"" in your head. Like a mind-virus. Or, yes, a meme: ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" became a literal meme precisely because it was catchy - everyone recognizes how quickly that melody catches on and makes you want to hum it because it's stuck in your head. I *LOVE* the odd time signature rhythm of Tool's 46&2, but that's the opposite of catchy because if I haven't heard it recently I can't even reproduce it exactly.

Being catchy doesn't necessarily make a song I like better, but it does make a song I hate a lot worse, because I don't want it to get stuck in my head if I don't like it. Most pop music becomes pop in the first place because pop is an arena where the music that's the most catchy to the most people will win out. Pop can fail to be catchy to a given person's ears, but if it deliberately tries to avoid being catchy then that by definition means it isn't pop, again IMO. It's hard if not impossible for a song to be catchy unless it's capable of being reproduced (even if poorly) by a single person humming. That doesn't guarantee that it is catchy, but it's very hard to be catchy without that. Again, think Never Gonna Give You Up: if I sang ""dada dada dah dah dah"", that's all it would take. 46&2 doesn't work that way, so much. You need the whole interplay between the different instruments."

I made statements I think are true, and maybe assumptions were made about *why* I was making them, but the best you could do is argue those assumptions were warranted even though I'm here following up making it clear they're false. On the other hand, what you're doing here is *blatantly* putting words in my mouth. Namely the word ""all.""

Hey, that's *actually* doing the thing that you assumed I did. Nobody in any part of this discussion has ever used the word ""all.""

My statement again:

>*plenty* of straight guys (*self included*) don't directly relate to *stuff like this*

Not a single absolute in there except for the statement I made about myself.

I don't even overstate my suspicion that ""most"" men aren't relating ""directly"" to stuff like this - I'm actually being *quite* careful and deliberate in my choice of words. I do *believe* that it is probably most, but the only thing I can be certain of is that a *lot* of them don't, so I word my conclusion as carefully as it's actually possible to. If a bunch of guys came in replying saying ""well, I totally relate to those songs in a very direct way"" I wouldn't feel I was being patronized to, I would start thinking I might have misjudged. 

The context here is that the thread is about two things. One, OP wants recommendations for music she might enjoy. I offered two in perfectly good faith and was disappointed that they were just completely ignored. Two, OP raised points for discussion because pure recommendation threads aren't allowed here. That discussion revolves around the question, how large of a role does gender play in one's ability to relate 'directly' to rock music? Looking at OP's examples, which presumably are the strongest examples that come to mind for her, I don't think *very many* men are relating 'directly' to the content of these songs. That's a perfectly reasonable thought to offer towards that discussion.

Generally, it is part of the very idea of songwriting that you try to take the specific details away until all you're left with is the generalized core, and then we find that we're more united by the core of our experiences than we are separated by the specifics of them. That's the whole basis of the notion that music brings people together - they might share appreciation of architecture or interior design, but that doesn't bring them together in the way that music does. If a piece of songwriting gets so specific that either men or women can't relate to it, I'd argue that it's probably not the strongest songwriting period - and, because it isn't the best songwriting, not very many people period are relating to it ""directly."""

My point was that I don't think they're ""relating directly"" to the things you find alienating either. My comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/ems79j/emotive_rock_songs_from_a_womans_perspective/fdsf1y5/) probably gets to the point better.

The converse would be if I said I can't relate to female rock singers as well as women do, and I used Halestorm's I Get Off as my example. It would be fair for a female listener to say: hey, most of us don't relate to that either, *most* women actually don't have exhibitionist fetishes, in fact the scenario that song describes would creep 99% of women the fuck out.

I'm not sure how you read that as me accusing you of having unrealistic expectations of your own relationship to music, but I noticed the Weyes Blood post and winced on your behalf since you clearly said you're not into them, and it seems like they got a more positive response than I did for contributing to the discussion after reading carefully and putting thought into my two reccs."

I can understand the essence of the song perfectly, and that’s what I relate to— but I cannot relate to it directly because I don’t need a dirty woman. I am straight.

Fwiw, plenty of straight guys (self included) don't directly relate to stuff like this either. My sex drive skyrockets in a relationship with someone I have chemistry with and plummets to zero when I'm single; plenty of other guys wouldn't relate for other reasons of their own. And on the flipside I don't relate to any ""masculinity is suffocating"" stuff either. I think the experience of ""relating directly"" may be less common than you think regardless of gender – for that matter we might assume that the thing we do relate to is what the lyricist had in mind and be completely wrong.

Also, I love that Weyes Blood album lol

science,fdnl869,t1_fdnicdd,1578588135.0,"Well, that's exactly the claim my comment is addressing:

In terms of econ theory, there is certainly a wage that's *too high* that will reduce employment without raising anyone's wage above what it would have been otherwise. But at every point below that, contrary to what many at say, the Von Mises Institute would tell you, econ theory *actually* says it will contribute to a net *increase* in employment - all else equal. There's no axiomatic rule that says the minimum wage is counter-productive no matter what.

It depends on where it's set.

To figure out where it should be set, what's the right amount that will raise wages and employment, what's *too high*, we have to turn to the empirical evidence.

And there, we're dealing with statistical correlations, which aren't always obvious and easy to tease apart. You can't isolate the minimum wage law in these studies. The minimum wage rose and then employment rose? It could be a coincidence. A million different things are changing at once. So you have to come up with a way to control for as much as possible, and every researcher is going to have a different idea about what the best way to do that is.

Well, after everyone implements their controls, some studies find a correlation, others don't. Overall, it looks like the preponderance of evidence says there usually is one. But then we have to confront publication bias. Studies that fail to find a connection between any one thing and another just don't get published as often in academia because they aren't considered to be as interesting. The existence of some publication bias in minimum wage research has been proven now. So we know for a fact that the published evidence is going to exaggerate the connection between the minimum wage and unemployment.

How much? We don't know.

**Econ theory:** There's some level at which a minimum wage law will have all pros and no cons. If it's set above that point, the effect of every $0.01 beyond that will have all cons and no pros. **Empirical study:** Where is that point? How do we find that level? Are we past it now? Were we past it then? **Answer:** We can try to make educated guesses, but nobody can really say they're 100% sure, because there were studies supporting both sides in the first place, but now we know that the evidence itself is skewed as a result of publication bias."

DivinityOriginalSin,fdnb13x,t1_fdna3uv,1578581891.0,"I'm still trying to wrap my head around this game, obviously, but I'm really into analyzing game design and thinking about the challenges given by games in detail. I like when games have ""real"" difficulty, and it isn't just a matter of it being hard to figure out *what* to do but being easy once you know... or grinding... or punishing you for small mistakes by forcing you to go through a long section all over again and the challenge is just in not getting bored enough to make another tiny mistake - Hitman on the highest difficulty setting is just nothing but that and that's really all. In my experience Dark Souls 1 was only ""hard"" because of that plus the first thing I mentioned. However, I loved Sekiro, I think that got to the essence of what was supposed to make DS hard while cutting out the crap - long respawns through boring sections just to get back to the real challenge again, it being a mystery what anything actually does. 

What would you say the difficulty in this game essentially consists of? To account for ""it's just hard because you don't know what to do"" let's say you walk in to the game already knowing the most viable character build from reading other peoples' posts.

Biohackers,fdn9cw7,t3_em9zbo,1578580742.0,"There are no special coatings that influence any of this. If you're visibly able to see the color blue, even a slight partial tint of blue, then blue wavelengths are reaching your eyes, it's just that simple. Any company selling you a clear, normal-looking lens and calling it ""blue-blocking"" is just scamming you.

Yellow lenses also don't completely eliminate blue. They cut it, but don't eliminate it entirely. That's why they're sold for daytime use when you don't want to trigger melatonin release. You can just use an app like Iris if you want to partly reduce the amount of blue in a PC, though.

And I'm not sure I see a point to using yellow lenses or cutting blue in daytime period, because [blue light exposure is *good for you* in the morning](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/blue-light-better-than-coffee/) \- just cut it in the evening. But by evening, you want to cut out all of it, and yellow lenses don't achieve this so they're still not optimal. In other words, yellow lenses are not good in the morning and not good enough in the late afternoon.

I cut the blue on my PC to about 70% with Iris because it looks more soothing to me, but if I didn't have exposure to sun in the morning I'd actually think it best to get the extra blue and then switch to a really dark filter late at night (under 1000 Kelvin).  

Also, blue isn't the only frequency to consider for sleep and circadian entrainment - it's just the worst offender. Melanopsin receptors respond to green as well, and even a little ways down into indigo. TrueDark glasses are the only lenses I know of that cut *all* of these frequencies entirely, unfortunately because they patented it and then sell them for $90 a pair.

TrueDark glasses are the best option by far. If you can't afford them, the closer you can get to a dark red/amber lens, the better. If you don't mind looking like a nut because you're only using it while browsing your phone in bed at night, ski goggles can get you 85% of the way for $10 on Ebay."
science,fdn7jos,t1_fdmcsvc,1578579427.0,"While a valid point, it is worth mentioning that **raising the minimum wage** ***can*** **result in increased employment**. It's possible that the preponderance of evidence looking like it points towards reduced employment resulting from the amount of minimum wage increases we currently have is a result of publication bias ([source](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.0950-0804.2005.00250.x); [another](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8543.2009.00723.x); [another](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjir.12031)), something plaguing the entire field of academia and discrediting possibly the majority of published social science.

How could it *increase* unemployment? What the academic models that say ""wages are the price for labor, raising prices means less demand for labor (aka employment), period"" leave out is *monopsony,* which can exist as a matter of degrees. It isn't as easy to relocate a person as it is to relocate a good: people can be - in fact most are - bound by relationships with relatives, and spouses, among many other things. Businesses can make conscious decisions about where to locate for optimal profit; workers rarely do this. Retraining a person to join another line of work is also nowhere near as easy as reusing a good or material towards a new purpose - there's psychological enjoyment of certain kinds of work compared to misery in others to consider, for example. There's less information on the side of low-wage workers than businesses: the grocery clerk at Ingles probably has no idea that the Walmart around the corner is paying its clerks 10% more. Since a degree of monopsony exists for most low-wage earners almost everywhere, wages are actually set below their optimal point in the supply-demand curve. That means even in the context of pure economic theory, there is obvious room for the possibility of minimum wage increases boosting employment. ([A basic econ intro to minimum wage in the context of monopsony](https://www.economicshelp.org/labour-markets/monopsony/))

Of course if you go above *that* point, *then* you'll reduce employment without benefiting anyone. That's where the question of *how high* to set the minimum wage becomes an empirical one. And that's where it becomes relevant to note that it's not clear how good even our best evidence is, due to the pervasive issues with publication bias in academia.

An employment-boosting effect for *some* raise to the minimum wage would happen even in the absence of welfare, but it's easy to see how welfare exaggerates the situation: many of the poorest people have to decide between working for a living or going on welfare. I've known people who could work and earn $1000 a month - not quite enough to live on - or quit work and take in $1200. They'd already rather work, but even doing their best wouldn't be worth the trouble. Make working a viable option for them, however, and they're going to prefer to work."
science,fdn4llu,t1_fdmbkcf,1578577119.0,"The alternative here isn't that it's either spurious or less suicide driving up the minimum wage. You're just posing a false dichotomy, and it's not a good reason to overlook the questions that remain with this type of data.

The alternative is that there could be entirely other common factors explaining both why the suicide rate dropped and why the minimum wage rose. It's entirely plausible, for example, that states only raise the minimum wage when the local economy is already on the upswing to begin with and there's a general tone of optimism in the air - things that could influence the suicide rate independently of the minimum wage itself, and explain the temporal relationship as well.

And then, for example, if unemployed people are the most likely to commit suicide, it could be that it's the ""rising employment"" part of a booming economy that results in less suicide rather than the wage.

There are also a huge number of different reasons *why* the wage could influence suicide, if it does do so independently. Men commit the vast majority of suicides, marriage reduces this risk - so it might not be ""giving poor people more money"" that makes suicide less likely but rather ""making minimum-wage-earning men marriageable"" that does it.
