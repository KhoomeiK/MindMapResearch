Otherwise at best you just get confused answers or people spit-balling an answer that might be tangential to the topic.

A better question would ask about the costs of healthcare per capita in a European country and the US, and reasons for the discrepancy in cost and access, and why those systems are run in the way they are.

The way the question is worded also indicates it was asked in bad faith, and didn't actually want an informed answer."

They're also trying to use countries in reference to states as a metaphor. It's not a totally ridiculous metaphor either for a lot of states who have their own legislature, relatively large population and GDP per capita larger then most European countries.


I'm from the UK and think the US healthcare is dumb and the questioner is kinda dumb for not being able to ask a totally coherent question. I don't think the answer is a murder though as it's something of a non sequitur."

Some people seem to be happy enough with that and put up with it. I've owned the Huge and Deft pro and people might disagree with this, but the 'break-in' period never happened, and I think a large part of it is psychosomatic as you get used to it and you imagine it's got better.

Logically nothing should be wearing in; the bearings, being either artificial ruby or ceramic, are extremely hard and durable. Trackballs are made of very hard resin and wouldn't wear with the forces involved. *If* the bearings were removing material from the ball or vice versa the trackball would perform worse over time.

If you think you're going to be sensitive to stiction or if it potentially hinders your PC use i.e. if you do image editing, 3d design, cad, also gaming etc, I'd maybe get a refund if you're able to do so."
