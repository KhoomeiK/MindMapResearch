""It's just the only way through sometimes."" I feel this very much. Truth."
Thetruthishere,ff4zlix,t1_ff49778,1579576288.0,"I'm definitely a skeptic, but an agnostic one. Even if you chalk things like this up to complete randomness there is a gorgeousness in the moment. And when they are THIS on point, seemingly well beyond biased interpretation, well...how can one NOT wonder?"
Thetruthishere,ff4z4yg,t1_ff3qw3r,1579575954.0,"Oof, that's heavy and awesome. I also lost my best friend, it isn't something I'd wish on my worst enemy. What a beautiful, bittersweet moment. ((hugs))"

aww,fdje9gz,t1_fdj8lbl,1578467174.0,"I didn't have pool or beach access as a kid except at summer camp for like 5 days once a year, so I call what I do ""not drowning"". I love water, can float, doggy paddle, cannonball off the deep end and otherwise frolic but haven't coerced myself into diving head-first. My little sister had a babysitter with a pool and was swimming at 2-3 years old. She doesn't get it either.

Have you ever seen Phoebe run on Friends? That's about how I ""not drown"". Taking swimming lessons is on my bucket list."

tifu,fdhn5v3,t3_eldcu3,1578426187.0,"Why is it presumed that you're using it by yourself? Just give solid eye contact, hand and guns, and a sly, ""FER THE LAAAADIES!"" to anyone who smirks."

tifu,fdb93gf,t1_fdauk0k,1578255074.0,"I was brought up Pentecostal and moved out at your age (I'm now 39). Parents still go. It took a couple of years and some pretty huge fights before my mom and I finally agreed to disagree. Still get the invites and still decline but the pushiness has abated. I'd of course rather she see things differently but it does seem to make her happy (mostly), so I've learned to be content with that. I think she just finally gave up thinking she could re-convert me, and that's really all I ask because I know I will never de-convert her and wouldn't try. All that to say there can be peace at some point. Good luck, OP! Makes me appreciate I'm no longer in your shoes, hah. She DEF would have gone straight to the pastor if she found something like that in my room."

aww,fd0eim8,t1_fcz0kjg,1578117682.0,"I don't know about lace monitors but water monitors are pretty intelligent, in my experience about the same as a kinda dumb dog. If you handle them enough they get used to human contact and can bond with people, especially their primary person. You still wouldn't want to get between them and their meal, but they do learn that you're the one providing it. They also have sweet spots to pet like scratching a dog behind the ears...again, as long as they've been handled well."
aww,fd0d9ua,t1_fcz3icp,1578117187.0,If I had a tegu it would def be Gus Gus instead of just Gus. The cute tubby rodent from Cinderella. Fitting.

mildlyinteresting,fczragi,t1_fcznhra,1578107279.0,"Jebus, with all the comments I think you would've been safer just calling it an avocado dip you make. I have to say I did try making it once after someone recommended it but never again. Blasphemy, at least as guac. I also came home from the weekend after Christmas with like 15 avocados from my auntie's tree. None are ripe enough and I can't wait for they day they will inevitably all turn perfect for like 2 seconds before going bad, because on that day I feast."
mildlyinteresting,fczqijt,t1_fczop58,1578106850.0,I agree but then again I use Greek yogurt for like any dip ever because yum.
aww,fczairx,t3_ejju8g,1578096999.0,"My old roommate had a water monitor that would crawl up and hang on his shoulders and lean on his head, would crawl down to take a dump and crawl back up for more bromance. Very polite doggo dragon."
aww,fcza31s,t1_fcz1nx5,1578096734.0,"I had two frilleds, one wild caught (not by me) and one captive bred. I was sitting in an enclosed hallway getting to know the first one our first few days together. He was chill mostly but one time I must've startled him because he out of nowhere frilled out and charged and after I pulled myself up from an insane dive-tumble-flop of attempted escape I appreciated how effective evolution can be. He just stood there all open-mouthed and poofy and smug for sec before going about his aloof business.

The other one never once flaired his frills. He was just a little mellow dude with a fancy scarf.

I adore those li'l bits so hard."

todayilearned,fcz519o,t1_fcz3wrs,1578093805.0,Very surprisingly creeped me out. Thought it was gonna be lame. Did have it's cheesy parts but they were way less than expected and it left me with a legit errie feeling afterward. Did not expect that. Been looking forward to watching again.
MaliciousCompliance,fcwoham,t1_fcwc9c7,1578031633.0,"I was one of those kids who failed the professor's ""read the entire test before beginning the test"" things. Skimmed through, started in on the problems and when time was called he asked who found the buried text saying ""don't bother with the test, just relax and wait for time to be called."" I've paid way more attention to instruction since then."

Greets us like a happy dog when we come home from work or anywhere really after a half hour, talks to us all the time, weasels into small places and is a squirmy bugger but loves the attention of us trying to get him, but also decides to ignore us when he feels like it. Doesn't care about the vacuum running unless it gets within two feet of him, then hops about three more feet away and is chill. I had a ferret who thought the running vacuum was a fun chew toy. Also loved to pull socks off of moving feet. Was scared of nothing."

MaliciousCompliance,fc1etlx,t1_fbct2xj,1577316633.0,"I lost a good friend in March of 2012. My HR department was kind enough to let me take grievance leave (the three days, usually alotted to direct relatives like a parent or spouse) as he lived in another town and the trip to his service took some time. A month later I lost my best friend. I was going to help his parents with organizing things and tbh really needed some time myself, especially away from a very stressful job. I went to my boss and asked for a day or two off using my vacation time. It of course was short notice (both deaths were very unexpected) but I had plenty of paid time accrued, plus had been working a ton of overtime (though salaried) so my duties were mostly covered. She looked at me deadpan and said, ""Didn't you just take grievance leave?"" Like I can control death. Luckily for me (and her), when I become actually enraged I go beyond tantrum into quiet seething. I told her I would see her Wednesday (this was Friday) and walked out the door. Reported the interaction to HR while also explaining why I was taking the days off and they said this wasn't even close to the first complaint about her management in the 9 months she had been there. She was fired that summer and the company went under within a year due to her gross mismanagement and negligence."
Thetruthishere,fc0wv8f,t1_fbz04l2,1577301827.0,"I stayed overnight in Odessa once on a road trip from California to the DFW area. Def got an ill feel from that town. Someone here nailed it saying that it felt like the town was dying; for me it was like it had one foot in being a ghost town. But also a darker feel, like there was a child prositution ring or something equally gross that the whole town was in on. I didn't see any evidence of the sort but I would not at all have been surprised to see it come to light.

El Paso was just the grossest city I've been through, felt it border to border. And I grew up in LA."
