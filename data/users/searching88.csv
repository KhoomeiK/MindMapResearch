I have a ton of friends in the medical field in Chicago and there is basically zero worry about her having spread the virus at all. The particular lady was very responsible with how she handled her situation and went and got checked out immediately after showing symptoms and is doing fine. They have already done a deep dive into anybody she could have infected and nothing has come up yet."
chicago,ffficrx,t1_fffh2k9,1579884601.0,You should definitely pick like anywhere else on the planet.

nba,ffcbj24,t1_ffb91kc,1579795879.0,"He was clearly being passive the first 3 quarters. His first touch in the 4th he attacked and dove straight for the rim, did a nice spin and had a decent look in the paint that he just missed. It was a clear energy shift. We saw what happened after that. If you watch his pre-season stuff its pretty evident the kid can play in the half court very well."

nfl,fekrzqr,t1_fekga68,1579206386.0,"I think its about intent. What makes slapping an ass any worse than slapping somebody on the shoulder or back? 

We have a video earlier of Rodger's taking pictures with people and he like pats/smacks both of them on the stomach. 

Clearly there is no wrongdoing there, right?

So what makes smacking a butt so bad? It's because it can possibly be sexualized. A butt is no different from any other part of the body. So if ODB playfully and non-sexually does a classic butt smack in a locker room, the same shit we see 400x in a game, as long as we know it wasn't a sexual assault, why can't we just move on? This shit isn't a big deal at all."

chicagofood,fef5nf6,t3_eotm9l,1579048756.0,Personally I love the ranch at wingstop. You can buy their large tub for $3.49. I hate the bottled crap. Wingstop makes theirs from the packets and it needs to be refrigerated but it’s really good ranch.
nba,fedvpw2,t1_fecka0w,1579020898.0,Dynasty? People have a hard time even saying the Warriors were a dynasty. You gotta win a lot of rings for that
keto,feduoy3,t1_fed1jyq,1579020283.0,"You’re right. I don’t think it’s a big deal if this was done to either gender (the comments OP is getting are harmless and confidence boosting), but I know my opinion may be in the minority."
keto,fecs1dh,t1_fecfm3n,1578982426.0,I say keep it rolling. It’s flattering and probably an amazing confidence boost.
AskReddit,fecp70a,t1_fecoxrc,1578979729.0,This isn’t a slippery slope of disclosure. Just don’t hide your biological gender or intentionally mislead people. It’s pretty important to the average person. Not a hard concept to grasp.
AskReddit,feci7mj,t1_fechz5w,1578974530.0,"Which, for the typical person, starts with biological gender."
chicagofood,fecfhwn,t1_fecexgh,1578972672.0,"Haha! Biggest factor is that I have close guy friends who love going to grab a nice meal somewhat consistently. It’s easier to eat nice steak when you’re only paying for yourself! I also am pretty consistently on a ketogenic diet so steakhouses are my go to when it comes to eating out. A perfect steak while in ketosis hits a spot that doesn’t even exist otherwise. So damn satisfying. On top of that, whenever friends or family come in from out of town, I’ve become the defacto guide for a nice meal in the city. Just getting steak from every angle lol

I also have been on a long journey of perfecting my steak at home too. The sous vide reverse sear with a usda prime cut is my current fave."
AskReddit,fec7yep,t1_fec7cpz,1578968215.0,Yeah let’s just close our eyes and cover our ears and pretend that biological gender has nothing to do with sexual preference and it’s just normal to withhold that very pertinent info on the basis that “normal people don’t tell each other everything before sex.”
chicagofood,feb9brq,t1_feb4y66,1578956573.0,"It's really such an awesome policy. Once, my date and I picked this really cute elderly couple to share with (they were already clearly enjoying some red wine) and they were just soo appreciative. They loved the wine (Clos Du Val - Cab) and came over and thanked us for the delicious wine and had a few questions and a lot of smiles. They were celebrating their wedding anniversary and were together for like 60-something years. It was such a great moment in that night. It's always really nice to watch the recipient realize they are getting a gifted glass of wine. I find most diners have no idea this policy exists at all."
chicagofood,feaqmxw,t3_eoak5j,1578951387.0,"Bavette's is the best. Pro-tip: you can bring your own bottle of wine! 1 per every two guests. They have an awesome policy for this. The ""corking fee"" is that you have to pick another table in the restaurant to share a glass with! It always enhances the night (and bringing a bottle definitely knocks a ton off the bill too).

When getting a reservation at Bavette's, you'll have the option of the Main dining room or the parlor. I personally love the Parlor, but its really a matter of taste. The Dining room is the classic wooden, warm, high class type of space. Lots of leather and a bustlin' ambiance. They play classic music here.  The parlor is downstairs, darker, more like a lounge. Really romantic and the booths feel really private. They play muted hip hop down stairs with the bass being the majority of what you hear. I really love the vibe down there, just my preference. 

I would reccomend Gibson's Italia over the regular gibsons, personally. The dining room is beautiful and the view is second to none. The Ribeye at Gibson's Italia (ordered Med to render all that delicious fat) with truffle butter is consistently the best steak I have in this city. Believe it or not, I've had a not amazing steak at Bavette's once, but Gibson's Italia has always been perfect. Much more romantic than regular Gibsons for an anniversary. Cant go wrong with either Bavette's or here. 

Maple and Ash is great as well and they will do the customized menu for you which is cool if you're into that."
nba,feafa65,t1_fe8qtji,1578947965.0,"You are forgetting that Butler really made a name for himself after that first Kobe matchup! It actually was a big milestone in his career. There was a headline somewhere that said ""The Kobe Stopper?"" and there was some national conversation about how well Butler played Kobe. It was a nationally televised game and that game was the first time the national audience started to hear about Butler's defense. I remember this all very well because I had lengthy arguments about this with my cousin at the time who is a huge Kobe stan."
nba,fe8rt6d,t1_fe8jhsk,1578929925.0,"I think you're underestimating how crazy Rodman was later on in his career. He was nowhere near that ""crazy"" on the Pistons."
nba,fe5yubs,t1_fe5fem2,1578877989.0,The guy literally said CJ Is a solid playmaker.
nba,fe5w8mg,t1_fe5ttd5,1578876344.0,Really?
nba,fe5t38x,t1_fe5snyh,1578874335.0,We have no idea if that was what caused RJ to kick out to the corner. That’s literally supposed to be their first read when driving into the paint. Extra bodies coming at you? Defense collapsing? Who’s open? You know your man is ready in the corner. I don’t want to sound like I’m tooting my own horn or better than thou but that’s a really basic level of basketball understanding.
nba,fe5qfnc,t1_fe5f3pl,1578873115.0,Oh cmon. You think yelling “corner” is that rare?!?
chicago,fdzr6rk,t1_fdzi9yj,1578793915.0,Interesting. Good to know. I understand that but I also think that’s a little bogus towards the other established and licensed growers. I say that because it’s clear that Illinois has enough demand for all the growers to provide rec weed and enough to allow more players in the market too. Maybe I’m wrong but I think that’s fairly obvious even though I don’t have hard data to back up that claim. I’m all for diversity in the market but not at the expense of other honest businesses and not for the sake of this artificial shortage. Does that sound reasonable?
chicago,fdxuy2a,t1_fdxu5k7,1578773158.0,Not quite sure the reasons why they took so long to grant the recreational growth permits and why they only gave it to 7 (out of the 18) licensed growers in IL. Not surprised though! Has Illinois written all over it haha
chicago,fdxt1cf,t1_fdxgfh1,1578772592.0,Regulations have bottlenecked production. IL only gave the green light to 7 growers to start production for recreational use and that was only in September of ‘19. This shortage has been predicted for months due to this reason.
chicagobulls,fdj2gor,t1_fdgixk8,1578456714.0,That one doesn’t really count in my opinion. Kobe was voted as a starter by fans and he pulled out of the game. Kerr decided to pick Klay as his replacement  as a starter. That situation allowed for the reserves to get a lot of minutes in his absence. You have a point but it’s not quite black and white.
chicagobulls,fdfqx1d,t1_fdfj41j,1578368034.0,"Your minutes in the all star game are really earned before the game even starts. The starters are already set and that’s who people want to see most. It’s the ASG, everybody on the floor can get hot. They aren’t going to take minutes away from a starter unless one of them really doesn’t want the minutes."
chicagobulls,fdfdtc7,t1_fdf9zhy,1578359350.0,"He won’t be a starter so he won’t get the minutes needed to win MVP.

Edit for those who have a hard time believing me:
Go look at all star game mvp’s over the years. You can go back over 20 years and they are all starters."

todayilearned,fc7bp9l,t1_fc76edx,1577502800.0,Happens quite often actually. People buy baby crocs/alligators and keep them as pets until they get too big and then release them into the wild.
todayilearned,fc6pwtj,t1_fc5zd0s,1577486501.0,"It wasn't as planned as you make it seem. You're correct, a gator/croc in the water isn't actually that rare and its happened before. What was different about this one was that instead of calling animal control first and having them handle it like they normally do, somebody called the news media instead and it just snowballed into this huge story."
todayilearned,fc6pqg7,t1_fc5st62,1577486375.0,"It was actually way cooler than that. People dressed up and came out cheering on the workers trying to capture him. The guy they brought up from Florida was a super introverted loner who had no idea what he was walking into, just went in and captured Chance (he was an expert trapper with decades of experience). He ended up becoming a huge overnight celebrity in Chicago. Was invited to sporting events, threw out the first pitch at a Cubs game. Would get standing ovations everywhere he went, free food, etc. He even met a woman due to all the fame even though he had been single all his life. He was on talkshows and everything. It was all very wholesome fun."
