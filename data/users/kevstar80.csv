AskMen,ffcwtr2,t3_esruuu,1579808922.0,Lost my first ring 2 days after my wedding Maui. My wife cried. Lost my second ring (which we bought in Maui) when my wife was pregnant with our second child. She said fuck it. No more rings for you.

cars,ff74uge,t1_ff6lmki,1579641152.0,"CVTs are hit or miss, are expensive to fix and no one wants to fix them. I was warned by a friend when I bought my 2013 Subaru outback about how it will be a great car forever as long as the CVT never goes. Did all the routine maintenance at the dealer... still at 135k miles, the early tell tale signs were all there of pending transmission failer. Traded that thing in as quick as I could for a Toyota highlander 8 speed transmission. Never again would I buy a cvt. Especially from Nissan."

sports,ff440u8,t1_ff43q84,1579555057.0,I grew up near old Mile High Stadium in Denver in the 80s. Seeing the Chiefs home games in Arrowhead these past 2 weekends brought back that old classic nostalgia missing from the new modern stadiums. I loved every moment of it.
sports,ff43hjw,t1_ff40jjj,1579554727.0,"Going to disagree. Pats were feeling old and same old same old. Mahomes, Lynch, San Fran, Chiefs 50 years between superbowls. High fly offense vs tough as nails defense. So many fresh story lines. Can Andy Reid get that elusive Superbowl ring? Will the niners pass the cowboys in superbowl titles?"
