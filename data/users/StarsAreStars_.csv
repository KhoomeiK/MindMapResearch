AskReddit,fekoqjg,t3_epj100,1579204462.0,"A little late to this and have no chance of knowing if it’s already out there but Ico for me. SOTC gets all the love and it’s a fine video game but I love it about a tenth as much as I love Ico. 

I felt so connected to the characters and the world. I loved the puzzles and genuine sense of vulnerability the core mechanic imparted. Leaving Yorda, even for a second, felt risky and worrying. 

It holds a very special place in my heart and it feels kinda forgotten and a tad underrated because people rightly loved Colossus."
gaming,fekmds7,t3_epnae7,1579203060.0,"I can but echo much of what has been said. I was pretty invested in the first game’s story and really loved the way it ended. 

I was really anticipating the sequel and discovering that the ‘sequel’ was treading a very different path was sorely disappointing. 

I lost all interest so thankfully didn’t bother with the 2017 title at all but it was little comfort that I’d seemingly avoided a poor game. 

I just wanted to play the next instalment if the original. I still do."

AskUK,fei8xuw,t1_fei4m4j,1579132925.0,"Hi there. That was an unintentionally vague attempt to surmise the way I believe the educational process now turns our students into examination commodities. 

A process that takes baseline assessments in year 7 and projects a flight path of progress through to exam results in year 11. It is relentlessly   tracked and monitored  and finally used as a very raw means of measuring school progress by Ofsted and in league tables. 

In practice this means students are exposed to constant pressure to achieve these far off levels and they effectively become the stick rather than the carrot figuratively speaking. 

This can manifest itself as kids being taken out of subject areas deemed as less important than core areas (eg English, Maths Science) for extra focused exam help. 

I’ve seen it mean kids being exposed to the same type of material from year 7 onwards with increasing difficulty which stifles creativity in teaching and delivers a narrow educational experience. 

There are many other ways it happens practically in schools but in my experience its a process where kids essentially become an examination grade to be obtained rather than a unique individual to be given a varied and appropriate education. 

I’m sure many might disagree and even suggest this is exactly what schools should be doing but in practice I found it to be dehumanising and not taking sufficient account of the whole person and the experience of each individual. 

By year 11 you can have attended any number of in house progress meeting about why certain students aren’t achieving a certain level and cohorts of kids at grade borderlines can receive a heavy focus of additional lessons and pressure. 

Again, some might think this sounds perfectly acceptable in theory but it’s not driven by the needs of the student but by schools worried about achieving grade and progress quotas as it attracts attention from Ofsted and reflected in poor league table performance. It has nothing to do with the welfare, the wider educational experience and strengths of our students. 

This is a very personal view of how the kids become commodities to me. That probably hasn’t really cleared it up and it feels an incomplete explanation and I could spend another hour detailing what I mean but I hope this will help."
AskUK,fehrbv7,t1_fehr6v6,1579122330.0,Very sage and insightful advice.
AskUK,fehm0c3,t1_fehlrea,1579119266.0,Then don’t waste time or miss your opportunities. Don’t end up with a decade in and wanting out and your opportunities are a lot more limited. All the very best and again I’m sorry for being some arsehole prophet of doom.
AskUK,fehjy0d,t1_fehhs1m,1579118075.0,"The autumn term is an utter killer regardless. 
I genuinely hope an old hand weighs in and provides an alternative perspective but I’m very much of the opinion that once you start to wish you were doing something else it doesn’t go away too easily. 

Don’t get me wrong, I miss the day to day teaching every day. It’s an art and a complete joy done right. The kids are the best bit. 

But the whole other side just takes and takes; Targets, Ofsted, Performance management, less and less time for marking and planning , weekends lost, feeling like a stranger to loved ones, almost weekly new initiatives that drive you spare, curriculums that kill creativity and an exam system that hurts the kids more than it helps...

If any of this sounds familiar and genuinely bothers you, I’d suggest you already know you need to get out. 

 I honestly believe it’s one of the best jobs anyone can do but the system we have is so horribly broken and I had to get out for the good of my mental health and life generally and despite a feeling of sadness for what it has become, I am better out of it."
AskUK,fehhbwc,t3_ep6jkd,1579116540.0,"I have an ex-colleague who made that change and is much happier. 

Whilst I can’t comment on the police as a career change, I got out of teaching after twenty years and I strongly advise that  if you are seriously dissatisfied then don’t dither forever and miss the boat of carving out a career in something that makes you happy. 

I genuinely don’t believe teaching is going to get better professionally any time soon. 

The work/life balance gets absurd with promotion and worse still, the commodification of the kids grinds you down. 

It breaks my heart to say it as it was my vocation but I hung around too long. 

All the best with whatever you decide to do."
