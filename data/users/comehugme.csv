But how long does it take? I'm 30 now. Some days I feel worthless and I've pretty much convinced myself I wasn't meant to be loved and shouldn't approach anyone. Even when someone is nice to me, I always think they want something from me.

Im a defective product. Growing up, I wished I had died when I was a toddler.

Yup. Literally most guys other than me.

But yeah. My best friend from university. Swimmers body (used to swim competitively). I would literally drool when we hung out drunk and half naked in my room.

It blew my mind when he told me he had incredibly low self esteem and doesn't think of himself as good looking. I obviously hugged him right there and then which turned into a kiss and told him I'd kill for his looks. He also thinks he's a failure cause he thinks he isn't very intelligent and wouldn't amount to anything in life. 

It just couldn't comprehend that someone as good looking (I'm talking model looks here) could go through the same shit I have been battling all my life. I'm a stocky hairy bearded cub lad. 


We did experiment. We still talk to this day. But much less now he's got a beautiful gf. He's still as cute and goofy. Biggest achievement of my life.
