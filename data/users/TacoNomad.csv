So not sure how much it is really a cool down, when they could earn more (less financial stress, more opportunities for recreation and hobbies), and gain benefits. With the added benefits of doing what they enjoy."
personalfinance,ffwedeg,t1_ffvqqr8,1580297763.0,"Maybe they have a garnishment in place?  If so, the govt can leave you with a set number and take the rest. OT then would go all to taxes.  Otherwise, yeah, they just don't understand how taxes work."
personalfinance,ffwcjt4,t1_ffu0o8u,1580295382.0,"I should add, when you complete this year's taxes, print them out either to a pdf or on paper, and save them. This way when you get to next year, you don't have to recalculate.  Also, if there comes any errors and the software has you locked out, you have duplicates and proof you filed so you don't have to redo it.  The irs, in my experience, waits about 3 years to notify you that they disagree with something or they think you didn't file or something. You might have trouble remembering which software you used, passwords, etc.  Just make copies."
personalfinance,ffwc3vw,t1_ffw5dvl,1580294789.0,"Yeah I'm afraid I'm going to owe this year too, because withholding balances out to nearly what I owe, but dividends the company does not know about are going to be taxed. I haven't gotten all of my tax docs yet, so I'm estimating at this point, but it was a good year for stocks."

AskReddit,fft42fa,t1_ffsunbn,1580205995.0,"You just raise the whole building thwn at that point.  That's what was suggestedto me when they thought the column lines were laid out wrong. Luckily they weren't. But that was the answer. Well, looks like we're moving the building 2 inches west."
HomeImprovement,fft3z6w,t1_ffsi791,1580205854.0,"Yeah. Like others have said, that wasn't installed correctly.  I'm tempted to agree with the comment that says just silicone in the back and smush it in there.  You could cut out the back backslash on the end, so that the side piece slides in behind it.  Then cut the side piece so that it stops at that molding. Then install so it's not creating that little gap there at the front. But it doesn't sound like you want to do that much"
AskReddit,ffseoi4,t1_ffse91l,1580179882.0,"Sometimea we can split it.  Spread the blame to everyone. Lol. Makes it easier to digest. Doing that right now. You should have known, I should have known, we both own it, let's split the difference."
AskReddit,ffsejrj,t3_euoqp6,1580179792.0,I picked up the habit in college. Engineering design problems have lots of different forces.  Need to show a different color of each direction /type of force.
