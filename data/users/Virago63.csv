vedicastrology,fe2zrdi,t3_efo5ox,1578844564.0,"Why Vedic astrology? Are you Indian? I just find that other systems like sidereal are more useful. (And more accurate) 
Understand that I'm no expert, but the relationships that last seem to have compatibility between the Sun in one person's chart and the moon in the other. On both sides. Also Saturn in one chart has to have a connection to a personal planet in the other - at least on one side. The personal planets are Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars.
Sexual compatibility-  on at least one side Mars in one chart has to hook up(ha) with Venus in the other chart. 
Mercury should be in compatible signs between the two charts, it rules communication- it's the way you think and the way you talk...everyone knows that you HAVE to have compatible sense of humor and to GET each other.
I've found that many of my partners born under the wonderful sign Taurus felt criticized due to my being too critical of them- I have Saturn in Aquarius which is square their sun. This was unconscious on my part. Saturn contacts are essential though for the relationship to last.
Good luck friend! Get out and meet people. Grocery store, book store, gym, golf course, the random meetings are best I find. Then if you get serious, see an astrologer. I promise it's money well spent! 
Good"
AskAstrologers,fe2o2hr,t1_fdz2ehj,1578841056.0,"I've read (and experienced firsthand) that a hard aspect between Saturn and the moon (square, conjunction, quincunx) may indicate a tendency to depression. For example, I have Saturn in Aquarius and the moon in Taurus- and I've had lifelong depression and anxiety. 
Of course people love you! But you have to love yourself first.
For me, it helped to stifle that inner critic that always said ""you always screw things up"" ""you suck at this."" I was so hard on myself - I have sun in Virgo quincunx the Saturn in Aquarius. Also a sun opposing the moon is supposed to lead to great inner conflict and low self esteem. I read a book called ""Feeling Good"" years ago and it really helped me to silence that inner critical voice. Also to deal with rejection. The idea that if someone rejects you, it's nothing wrong with YOU, it's a matter of preference. His example in the book was ""just because someone prefers apple pie, it doesnt mean that something is wrong with cherry pie.""
Don't take breakups so hard. Many relationships fail due to a simple lack of communication. 
Take good care friend."
