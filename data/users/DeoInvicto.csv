Justrolledintotheshop,fdo1gy4,t1_fdnyd1c,1578597140.0,"Yes its an automatic transmission and the object on the left is the planetary gears and on the right is the sun gear. There is also a ring gear on the exterior of the  planetary gears which is probably also damaged. The cause could possibly be the transmission was ran without trany fluid or operator misuse. Could also be a manufacturing defect, although thats less likely."
