C_S_T,fffwmui,t3_et5kxq,1579893415.0,"I had this exact same feeling a few years ago. I was so fed up with everything that I wanted to leave it all behind and go live in a monastery. Then I realized there are lots of things in this world that I don’t want to abandon, like friends family good music and food and adventures and so on. Long story short, I realized the Middle Way was not a literal lifestyle where I had to abandon everything and live as a monk in the forest; I could actually attain the peace and serenity I want in THIS world and this lifetime. Of course it will be much more difficult, but to to abandon life because it’s too difficult is cowardly and weak. I’ve been depressed anxious suicidal sick lonely poor weak ill and so on. I’ve had almost all the highs and lows a human can have, and yet I made it out alive and found some value and meaning in it all. I haven’t achieved everything I want to, but I know that it’s possible and I also know it’s the most worthwhile thing in life. 

Daydreaming about leaving modern society is just a fancy excuse for avoiding your own inner demons: what’s preventing you from living the greatest life possible? Are you living your happiest life? Is this everything you wanted? If it’s not then your life work is to fix it and make things right. That why you came here in the first place, is it not? :)"

AstralProjection,fek2m8x,t3_epkxs9,1579191290.0,"I believe in an afterlife that's equal and just. Everyone receives what they deserve. The life you lived according to your thoughts, beliefs, and actions on earth will follow you into the astral realm and determine your fate in the spirit world. People who live bad lives and do the wrong things will have to suffer in the lower astral plane until they learn their lesson and have become purified enough to ascend higher again or return to earth. People who lived good lives will go to 'heaven,' which consists of degrees depending on how positive/altruistic/virtuous you were in your life. The entire system is based on energy and vibration, and karma is the mechanism by which people's fate is determined according to their actions. Heaven and hell are primarily mental/emotional states which can be experienced in the physical form but also when disembodied."
awakened,fehdsis,t1_fegxp6n,1579114477.0,">“To seek nothing. Ordinary people, in their perpetual ignorance, crave form and attachments to everything, everywhere. This is called seeking. The wise are awakened to the Truth, and choose reason over convention; even though their forms follow the law of causality, their minds are at peace and empty of effort. Since all existence is empty, there is nothing to be desired. Blessing and darkness always follow each other. This long sjourn in the Triple Realm is like living in a burning house; to have a body is to suffer, how can one attain peace?

I'm taking good meds now so I don't feel manic anymore, but I still create art and write like I used to, probably even better now because I'm more grounded in reality. The only difference is that the inspiration and creativity is harder to come by. When I was manic I could pretty much force myself to do whatever I wanted to and somehow find the inspiration or motivation, but now it is more 'normal' you could say. But I can guarantee that with time you will get used to it and eventually, with enough practice and persistence and patience, you will be back to your usual self and be able to do all the creative work you used to without the mania."
