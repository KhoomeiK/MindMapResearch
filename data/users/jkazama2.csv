funny,fff7i0u,t1_ffdycjl,1579877660.0,Lol I like this
todayilearned,fechxxj,t1_feb5pi8,1578974344.0,I mean....they've gotta get to where they gotta get right?  How else would you do it... /s
todayilearned,fechwd6,t1_feb9vnn,1578974314.0,"I've definitely seen that here as well.  It is far and few between but man, you can spot them fairly easily.  What you say makes total sense."
todayilearned,fechsws,t1_febyzyf,1578974248.0,"There are some 500 rupee fines, and you're so right, it's just not enforced and seen as an inconvenience more than a ""oh I shouldn't do this"".  I do hope it get's better!  I normally travel to Bangalore, and it's just out of control.  Went up to Jaipur and it seemed a bit more organised but that's just cause there is less people there (3.4M in Jaipur vs. ~8.5M in B'lore).  Infrastructure just ain't there to handle that many people.  Though I do really dig the metro they've built there, it really does help cut down travel time."
todayilearned,feakl7v,t1_fe94b2y,1578949905.0,"Am an Indian who's lived in the midwest for 28 years.  Every time I come back from India, the peace and quiet on the roads feels so alien to me since I've just been assaulted by chaos daily for weeks/months.  My mom would always say ""oh if you can drive in India you can drive anywhere"".  Not true.  If you can drive in India, you'll just drive like an asshole shitty driver anywhere in the west"
todayilearned,feajvfv,t1_feadhm4,1578949695.0,"Lanes and traffic flow direction are more of a suggestion than rules on Indian roads.  ""Oh you want to get to that petrol station on the other side of the road that would require you to do a U turn legally?  Just do it in the middle of traffic because why not...""  Was just there visiting family, and I mentally prepared myself for the traffic.  Silent and calm on the outside, screaming internally"
AskReddit,fdhwfnp,t1_fdh942v,1578431387.0,"lol had this happen to me recently on a topic about solid state batteries.  Dude didn't like any of the responses I gave even though none of them were rude and I was trying to explain a point/how I would know about those things.  Nope, instant downvote to 0 because ""i DoNt AgReE wItH yOu"".  So I was like, alright dude, you do you, that's fine too.  Doesn't change anything"
AskReddit,fdhs1wn,t1_fdgpnvm,1578429072.0,"God I hate this one so much.  It's so passive and defeatist, accepting shit for what it is just because it would take effort to not do so"
PublicFreakout,fbglnvz,t1_fbg0m81,1576852839.0,This is what I was looking for. Thank you good sir
