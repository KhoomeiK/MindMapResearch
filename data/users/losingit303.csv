fatlogic,ffkv9wy,t1_ffk1v88,1580029602.0,My diet isnt even all that great and I think that 95% of McDonald's menu tastes like ass. Hell I'll go one further it tastes worse than ass.
fatlogic,ffkv1qo,t1_ffk0zpx,1580029460.0,Depends on how long they film it for. Change is still interesting when you can gloss over the repetition of the process to getting there.
fatlogic,ffktp5h,t1_ffjgibb,1580028682.0,"> Does doing so carry a risk of violence? Do other people beat you.

I'm generally with you on your message. But I've actually got my ass beat to the point where I had a concussion literally just for being fat. Admittedly I was in high school and this generally doesn't happen to adults the way being gay can cause it but it doesn't make beating people up any better.

Violent people will use any excuse to be violent.that being said everything else you said is true."

I mentioned that, actually :D"
fatlogic,ffj3gq1,t1_ffj2ins,1579989427.0,"This wasn't meant to be a personal attack to the individuals. It's more about criticising the message and why it exists the way it does considering the preferred way it started.

On an individual level it's great that you're exercising in general. An extra slice of pizza is a dumb motivation if you ask me but who am I to judge? That part of the comment was more directed at this effectively encouraging exercise bulimia. Because most of the world's overconsumption is more or less to the point where half marathons every other day might not be enough to counteract people's horrible diets. I actually do run half marathons that often but my point just to make it clear is that doing so simply to eat more is clearly an indication that something is wrong."
fatlogic,ffizgha,t1_ffio7rw,1579986541.0,"Yeah but ultimately it was the food lobby that curtailed her progress shifting it towards exercise. Because pointlessly expending energy is a preferred alternative than reduced consumption in a system built on the idea of perpetual growth regardless of circumstances.

That isn't to say that exercise is pointless of course but at some point you reach a point of diminishing returns where you're doing it either because you a)really enjoy it or b)are an actual athlete and that's your job. Exercising just to at copious amounts of food is a pretty dumb reason to exercise and it's a shame that it's the narrative that got sprung just to appease a few food industry CEO's"
fatlogic,ffh9s7j,t1_fffy416,1579927269.0,"I mean, thats nebulous enough where it doesnt have that implication. Can certainly mean other eating disorders. Like BED for example. Now I'm sure that's not what they meant as they would never admit it but you can totally read it that way."
fatlogic,ffh98y2,t3_etjt3c,1579926790.0,Ha tell it to my tailbone. Years later still waaay harder to sit without pain in my backside after the 10+ years of cushioning there.
fatlogic,ffh92yf,t1_ffgllwx,1579926645.0,"> If you stop eating for a long time, then eating a lot more whilst you regain healthy weight 

Seriously dont do that. There's this thing called ""refeeding syndrome"". You can literally die because of it. So yeah not even close to a good analogy no matter how one looks at it."
fatlogic,ffh7zjj,t3_etg8n6,1579925705.0,"As a male with an ED, I agree. Obviously I'm biased since, in theory, the media doesnt affect me as much. Though I dont buy that as guys have insecurities and male actors, musicians etc tend to, on average be handsome individuals.

Anyway, I remember stating a lot of the same opinions shared in the article in a now-defunct ED subreddit citing the Netflix movie ""To the Bone"" as the perfect example of what I'm talking about.  That more often than not there are serious underlying issues that cause mental disorders. Whether trauma, bullying, abuse etc. Yet I got downvoted to all hell. So if people with actual eating disorders think that its that I'm not 100% sure what to think

Sure it's not great that we're all subjected to so much vanity but this is a complex mental issue and you can't convince me that everything else in your life was perfect and it was the freaking fashion magazine that did this to you. Especially when it comes to anorexia nervosa.

Sorry for rambling I'm just salty I got downvoted for daring to suggest that people have personal agency."
fatlogic,ffg7826,t1_fffcn46,1579899951.0,That seems excessively cruel to those other kids :/
bulgaria,fffrho9,t1_ffequxl,1579890211.0,Yes but this isnt iron supplements when taking blood thinners. My mom's a nurse and my uncle is a doctor. You'd be hard pressed to find many vitamins you can't take with prescription drugs. Much less vitamin fucking D which you intake on a daily basis regardless if you want to anyway.
EDanonymemes,ffe1210,t3_et0dta,1579833940.0,"I mean, it worked out for both Naruto and Sasuke. Arm notwithstanding."
bulgaria,ffd82va,t1_ffcrt3s,1579815245.0,If it was drugs I would agree with you but ffs its vitamins. The likelihood of overdosing on vitamin d or Vitamin K2(MK7&Mk4 is non-existent) regardless of what else he's taking.
