relationship_advice,fffkbpm,t3_ess6p9,1579885818.0,"Sorry dude but she doesn’t get to say if you are or are not in her life.  You are going to have to go no contact.  It’s the only way you can get out of the cycle, heal and move on.  And you deserve to be happy just at much as she does.  Take your power back and cut this chic off!"

relationship_advice,fff5txt,t1_fff53b7,1579876464.0,This is so hard for me because I get sad that I’m missing out on relationship time with my mom and she won’t be here forever.  But distance is unfortunately the only way I’ve found peace.
relationship_advice,fff384i,t1_fff3533,1579874496.0,I know.  It doesn’t help that my bf is super close with his family and basically gives me crap for not doing anything.
relationship_advice,ffeyjbr,t3_et9sj5,1579870463.0,"Facebook messenger isn’t always accurate.  For example my bf’s phone died and it showed him as active because his computer had Facebook open but he wasn’t at his computer.  And he doesn’t have to answer you every time he comes online, he might be busy!"

relationship_advice,fez8sv2,t3_eqyflm,1579454906.0,"Firstly the other commenter is spot on.  I’m only chiming in because I am in your shoes as well.  My bf works for an elementary school and it’s 95% women.  He has one girl who is still obsessed with him even though he slept with her once like 3 years ago and has told her several times he is not interested.  He gets hit on and flirted with all the time.  He’s a really good looking, magnanimous guy who smells great.  Women just flock to him.

So here is what I do - and let me be straight I still have my moments where I get upset/jealous/question things and these thoughts help ground me.

1) He chose YOU.  And you alone.  He does have his pic.  He has no problem getting girls.  And he still chose you.  That should make you feel like a goddamn amazing queen.  My bf is very experienced in the bedroom and I am well..not...and the day he told me I was the best sex he’s ever had I felt like a rockstar.  It’s not always about looks, it’s much more about connection and you and your man clearly have that.

2) Every time a girl hits on your man, take that as a compliment.  You have something that other girls want.  Some may think that’s childish but I do a little “nah nah ha ha I got him and you didn’t” dance in my head that I would never tell anyone I do besides strangers on YouTube.

3) Assert your dominance.  This doesn’t mean checking girls or being outwardly aggressive, it’s about being confident.  Anytime my bf takes me to a work event, I proudly reach my hand out for a hand shake, look whosiwhatsit whose flirting with my man straight in the eyes and say “hello, nice to meet you I’m “boyfriends name” girlfriend”.  Just exert your confidence and most women will get the hint.

4) Lastly if there is some one specifically disrespecting your relationship it is perfectly acceptable to have a discussion with your bf regarding it.  I have found that any girl who is close to my bf but wasn’t kind to me or didn’t want to meet me was not good news.  And they usually weren’t happy he was in a relationship. So I would ask that he limit contact with those women.

I feel ya girl.  It’s awesome and amazing to have the hot guy but...it can come with some drawbacks.  Just remember...you got the prize."
FemaleDatingStrategy,feymctc,t3_eqvct3,1579447538.0,"My current bf and I broke up for a very short time 2 years ago, and that time included his birthday.  I battled the whole day but didn’t text him.  When we got back together he said being at his birthday party and looking around and not having me in the room made him realize what was important to him.  It’s a hard NO."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fey5vxw,t3_eqvi68,1579441249.0,"I’ve done it but the big difference is we were practically a couple just with a FWB title.  We were still going out to eat, movies, hanging out, having sex ad the biggest thing is we NEVER lost communication.  We talked every day.  And here’s how I did it.  We had the talk about what we wanted from the relationship.  I wanted to be official, he wasn’t ready.  So I was nice about it but I told him I couldn’t just be his friend and CUT CONTACT.  No text, fb or insta.  Nothing.  He would still like my posts but I never responded.  So after about 2 weeks he texted me and asked if we could talk and he came over and confessed all these feelings for me.  I was legit in shock.  And we started officially dating.  The big thing is men fall in love in your absence.  And he needed to know what it felt like to not have me around.  I already knew we were best friends who just happened to have amazing sex, so I had to pull it all back because if I stayed friends we would have just stayed where we were (and without the sex which what fun is that?).  

And you better believe when he did text me to talk...I left that shit on read for 2 days.  I wanted him to go to sleep that night having to question whether I still wanted him or not."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fey48y2,t3_eqmm5k,1579440664.0,"Oh Jesus the female friend.  I dated a guy who had a lot of female friends.  Like ALOT.  So finally I just straight out asked how many of them had he slept with.  It was about 75% of them.  Those are not friends honey.  Those are bench warmers.  And the worst part was a lot of them HATED me.  They would make all sorts of veiled comments and put downs and in not going to put up for that crap.  That eventually broke us up, but I’m sure he banged one of them that night."
relationship_advice,fetk1kq,t1_fetigag,1579376203.0,I think he probably is without realizing it
relationship_advice,fetg5r5,t1_fetf7ug,1579375142.0,That’s what I told him.  It’s not my job to ride out ANYTHING.  I think my next step is suggesting us going to a counselor together.

ManagedByNarcissists,fdxkh9i,t1_fdx7zm3,1578769728.0,I have the evaluation and I was going to be let go.  Plus she told my union rep ahead of time.  Unfortunately how my job was I only had one evaluator and she delayed my evaluations so I got 3 all within a month of each other.  I went to my union rep about that too because In my industry you are required to have atleast two evaluators and have 4 evaluations completed on a specific time frame.  My position fell into a special loophole category that didn’t need to adhere to those requirements so even though my evaluations before her were fantastic it didn’t matter.  She was the head honcho so there was no one I could argue to and HR aided with her (they are in the same union so it would be stupid for him not to).  Anyway - I did know 100% for certain I was being let go so resigning was the only smart option I had.

ManagedByNarcissists,fdwz1p6,t1_fdwwwdn,1578763716.0,"I wish I could have kept pushing but I was going to be shown the door, so it made sense professionally to step down vs having a “non renewal” on my resume which is what it would be for my industry.  I had to sit and say am I forcing a round peg into a a square hole here by staying in this line of work?  Which I think I was trying to do.

I will say I am proud of myself for negotiating in my new job.  They wanted to start me at step 1 which isn’t appropriate given I have experience and I negotiated up my salary (even tho it still kinda sucks).  But I was raised by an alcoholic father which gives me crazy people pleaser tendencies.  My N boss actually had the nerve to text me a month ago asking me to call her, and I left that shit on read."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fdwsvjd,t3_en3mvd,1578762018.0,"So...just to play devils advocate here...my bf got a dui 6 years ago at 32.  And thankfully it was his wake up call.  They impounded his car, he lost his liscence, got a 10k fine, the works.  He didn’t disclose it to me right up front, but he left the cops writing on the window of his car (they marked the car when they impounded it) as a reminder to get his shit together.

I don’t think we should judge by mistakes but how you learn from them.  Lord knows we have all screwed up at some point...it’s how you grow.  Now he’s got his shit together, great job, great son and a great bf.  He fucked up and thankfully didn’t kill anyone.  Now he’s a volunteer fire fighter and is trained to rescue people out of their car when they are trapped after an accident as a way if giving back.  So MAYBE (and it’s prolly a huge maybe) his DUI is a big part of who he is now.  And yes Canada treats a US DUI as a felony so you have to fill out paperwork to be allowed in after 5 years, it’s not a block to all other countries.  I wouldn’t completely write him off because of this, but investigate to see why he shared this off the bat."

Anxiety,fdt96sp,t3_en2096,1578713557.0,I’ve taken Xanax for the past 3 years as needed.  Sometimes I don’t need it at all and sometimes I need to take up to 2mg.  It’s been a life saver and I’ve noticed if you have really bad anxiety you are affected by it very differently then if you take it just for fun.  I haven’t tried to stop taking it so I can’t speak to what it’s like to come off of it.
AskReddit,fdt7hhx,t3_en20am,1578712927.0,"Together for 3.5 years, we met at work but didn’t exchange numbers until about 7 months in.  We were “friends” but very flirty for about 2 months.

relationship_advice,fdt25rb,t3_en12fv,1578710942.0,"I am in a very happy committed relationship and I look up random people all the time.  Men, women, exes, friends significant others.  Sometimes I’m just curious to see what other people’s significant others look like...like if they “go” together.  It’s weird....but I’m pretty sure everyone does it.  Just because I look up another dude doesn’t mean I want to bang him or live my bf any less."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fdsy8il,t3_emj04v,1578709497.0,"I hooked up with a dude for years on and off whose last name was Harrison...so his friends called him Harry.  He was such a sketchball, he would HMU when he was single but still flirt and be just generally inappropriate while he was in a relationship. I really liked him so I would let him get away with it.  We eventually went our separate ways and a few years ago a mutual friend of ours went to his wedding.  All I could think is “I feel so bad for his wife” knowing how gross he was with me behind all of his gf’s backs.

Sorry for the trip down memory lane but anytime I see “Harry” his gross ass pops up in my brain."
relationship_advice,fdsezkf,t3_emzfut,1578701203.0,Are you leaving this job in a week? If so then I say your best bet is to exchange numbers and start chatting after you leave.  If you are not leaving this job...do not mess around with him.  He is your boss.  You could lose your job or cost him his at worst and at best end up making work really awkward for yourself.  Best of luck!
relationship_advice,fdseudy,t3_emzhk9,1578701101.0,I would check with your local women’s shelter as well as maybe look online for a room for rents. You may be able to atleast get out and into a room to remove yourself from his house.  I’m so sorry that sounds really disgusting and I hope you get out soon.
CatsAreAssholes,fds4ixr,t1_fds45ol,1578694181.0,He really does do beautiful work.  My bf is also obsessed with TOOL and he was selling signed posters for Xmas for $350 and that was a bit too rich for my blood.  At least this is artwork he can use!

His style is very hippy dippy and psychedelic and him and his wife are both artists.  They have a house in northern ny (in the states) where you can go to see all their work and they host parties with food and bonfires and music and fire breathers.  I went to one with my bf and it was really beautiful.  We talk about possibly having our wedding there too.  We like his stuff but it’s not everyone’s cup of tea.  Of how ever you do like his stuff I would recommend checking out https://androidjones-obtain.com/collections/fine-art-prints as well as he does some really gorgeous graphic art.  Enjoy!"

CatsAreAssholes,fdrzfeq,t1_fdryczj,1578691994.0,"Not sure if I mentioned this in this thread or another one and the art work on it is by his favorite artist, Alex Grey.  He’s pretty obsessed which also accounts for the cost.  I love his art work it’s really beautiful."
CatsAreAssholes,fdrx6dh,t1_fdrkf41,1578691068.0,I would have agreed with you until we got this one.  He does yoga every day and it’s one of the items I would now agree to get a higher quality version of it is worth it.  It doesn’t slip like his $20 one does which really helps with holding positions.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fdrx07k,t1_fdqlhfi,1578690965.0,"I also think her bigger point is would be be proud of telling someone how you met?  If you were to honestly describe it?  If he jerking you around then you probably won’t ever get to a point in time when you are describing how you met to someone, and even if you do it will probably be pretty cringey."
CatsAreAssholes,fdrwtei,t1_fdr2a8h,1578690851.0,"Yes and it’s a really really nice.  I know $90 seems like a ton of money for a yoga mat but it’s beautifully colored and bright, and the quality is great.  My bf does yoga every day so getting home something that doesn’t slip or tear was worth it."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fdrwpob,t1_fdqlhfi,1578690788.0,"Did he cheat on her with a subscriber?  I know she doesn’t really come out with what happened between the two of them, she just describes it as a bunch of micro decisions that pushed them apart, and not a big event.  I’d like to think of he cheated on her that would count as a big event.  I know she definitely talks an bout subscribers getting up in his DMs but I’m curious where you heard that actually happened?"
CatsAreAssholes,fdporyl,t1_fdpoe5a,1578634937.0,The cost is for the art work - it’s by his favorite artist Alex Grey.  And I will say it’s a very very high quality yoga mat...it was his Xmas present :)
