dogs,fdvrjd4,t1_fdvjnff,1578750705.0,I was thinking mange myself. I really hope it works out with the mom and pups.

making him part of my family."
dogs,fdttt2l,t3_en3fji,1578722091.0,Not an expert but my husky mix has done something similar. I call him to me now to keep from startling him when he's not following me. My dog will wake the entire house once he starts.
dogs,fdtpooj,t1_fdtmdjs,1578720274.0,This guy will have a home here. Unfortunately we will see between 2 and 4 stray's a month. We train the puppies and re-home them when we can the aggressive ones have to go to pound the older ones we know nobody will adopt so we always try to accommodate them.
dogs,fdtor17,t1_fdtasan,1578719875.0,"Unfortunately in the past 12 years that I've lived here I have gotten a lot of older dogs and puppies this time of the year. I figure people get puppies and get rid of the older dogs, others get puppies and realize how much work they are and throw them out. I gave him some Benadryl and I'll see what the vet says Monday I appreciate it."

dogs,fd3ne9s,t3_ejyiyu,1578159963.0,I have two a husky mix and a lab. The lab will lay his head directly on mine if he's up first. The husky mix will nudge the door and if that doesn't work he will lick my ears and face.
HVAC,fd3fv7g,t3_ejz0bt,1578157901.0,Moving the unit is a pretty simple job. There are a few cons to it like running the line set in a way that might make it less appealing. The way the rain runs off the house also makes a difference if it's a heat pump. Building a decorative fence around it leaving enough room for the system to breathe without restriction might be a better solution if it's just an eyesore. I have relocated plenty of units and most of the time it's because big noise in the master bedroom or walls. This might not be a problem now but relocating it may cause them.
HVAC,fcshs2c,t3_eif0bu,1577916769.0,I've actually had the home owner pull wires out while I was installing it. He was a retired engineer and claimed that it wasn't needed he was wrong and didn't believe me when I told him. And on a different occasion the same guy bought a new thermostat and didn't want to pay the $20 for us to install it. So he had to pay a service call and 80 for us to run a new wire and fuse.

dogs,fcncwy4,t1_fcnboqf,1577809020.0,"When we picked them up we didn't speak to the vet directly. The lady that I normally talk to pretty much told me that the vet didn't find anything, he recommended trying a different brand of food. We tried a new dry food this morning and they took right to it."
dogs,fcnbh49,t1_fcn9w3k,1577808057.0,They kept them for about 4 hrs when I took them I'm not completely sure what they did I do know they collected a stool and blood sample for both and checked for a bowel obstruction.
dogs,fcn5me1,t1_fcn3jnd,1577803896.0,That makes sense actually one of the stray dogs around my house has been coming up to the fence and my older dog has been whimpering to go out. Unfortunately I live in a rural area and people tend to drop off their dogs and other animals.
dogs,fcn1lhg,t1_fcmv59x,1577800649.0,No they are not??
dogs,fcmhd4z,t1_fcmdgll,1577775316.0,We feed them the pure balance brand in both wet and dry. They have gotten treats and they still eat them just not their food.
dogs,fcmh8nb,t1_fcmb053,1577775178.0,They get a mix of wet and dry each meal. I'm going to try a new bag tomorrow.
dogs,fcmgycs,t1_fcmb9nx,1577774867.0,Nothing has really changed. The vet said to try new food.
