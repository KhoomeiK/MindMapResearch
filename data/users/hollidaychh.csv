trees,feotlpg,t1_feotain,1579305263.0,"Yeah. Different states have different laws about what is required to be on cannabis packaging. Unfortunately here there arenâ€™t many. 

The information you need is the terpene breakout, but WA doesnâ€™t make producers add it. I think in California itâ€™s required."

TrollXChromosomes,fdiv3xt,t1_fdg4zzo,1578451715.0,Omg. I thought something was seriously wrong with me until I slapped some heating pads on. I celebrated with a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch..but without the milk because I'm a fuckin weirdo like that.

AskReddit,fd3y660,t1_fd0piiu,1578162660.0,"Ugh. Itâ€™s such a nasty disease and what youâ€™re saying sounds very familiar. I do recall my grandpa accusing my grandma of cheating on him and stuff, among other things. 

Iâ€™m so sorry you had to go through that. And your mom too. I just hope eventually they find a cure. Thank you for sharing your story with me."
AskReddit,fd0ksdo,t3_ejdlbw,1578120245.0,"When my grandpa was dying of Alzheimers, my grandma bitched and complained that she shouldnâ€™t have to spend the rest of her life taking care of him. It broke me apart. 

They started dating when they were in middle school, and have been together since. It kind of shattered my vision of what I believed were my happy, loving grandparents.

Heâ€™s since died and I still have trouble reconnecting with my grandma."
