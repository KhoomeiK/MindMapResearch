TwoXChromosomes,ffp43o6,t3_eu361s,1580085744.0,"Ugh, I hate that this happened to you and that anyone has to do that. People who don't care about boundaries or reading someone's body language, who feel they are entitled to something like your attention, really don't seem to understand anything but ""Go away and leave me alone."" 

But yeah, is it always safe to do that? There are enough stories from people I know, the media and my own experiences to know that unfortunately it's an unknown and a risky unknown at that. Maybe the person who outweighs you by 100 pounds or more, with increased muscle mass and strength who you would have no hope of fighting off if they really came at you will apologize and back down. Or maybe they'll be waiting by your car when you go outside or freak out and hit you right then and there in front of witnesses, which yes has happened enough times in the media and/or personally to people for us all to know this is a real thing.

I think you handled it really well and it kept you safe if annoyed and interrupted. But someone who honestly thinks he can ""help you grade papers"" like he knows more than you just as a pickup line isn't someone anyone should assume is a rational person in the first place. The entitlement oozing off of that guy was ridiculous and yeah, I think you were smart not to openly antagonize him. You also would have had his buddies to deal with then and a pack mentality is a dangerous one and all too often with that type of individual that is exactly what they go into when they get angered.

It sucks and I think there's not going to be any one way to handle it. I've flat out cussed people out for that type of behavior and had them laugh and apologize and back down. I've also said, ""Buzz off"" to a guy who made a comment about my ass as I walked by him on the sidewalk and had him chase me for four terrifying blocks screaming he was going to kill me. I finally made it to my office and a security guard saw what was going on and chased the guy off. If I hadn't been able to outrun him he'd have hurt me badly or worse. 

A good book I recommend to people is Tim Larkin's ""When Violence Is The Answer."" He goes into self-defense methods, but the one takeaway I really value from that book is when he goes into the different types of aggression people exhibit and what to do with each of these. When and how to escalate or not escalate.  

And trust me, I know the feeling of wanting to have been able to stand up, tower 8 feet over someone and say in a calm voice, ""What did you just say?"" in a way that would make them pee their pants and run out the door. Unfortunately until they start selling magic she-hulk potions I think we're all each going to have to do the best we can. In this case you clearly exhibited ""Leave me the fuck alone"" without saying that or giving the guy and his cronies an excuse to escalate it to possible worse aggression. You were smart. Him, not so much."
TwoXChromosomes,ffotozr,t1_fflobps,1580081677.0,"Being older may slow down the number of predatory types hitting on one, but it doesn't completely stop them. Because I look younger than my years I continued to get hit on well into my early 50s although yeah, after my mid-30s it did slow down. Now it's mostly just when a) they think I'm by myself and vulnerable or b) if I'm wearing dark glasses and at a distance/in a car where they mistake me for someone younger since I have long blonde/white hair. When I take the glasses off and they get up close they can tell I'm not as young as they thought. The look of disappointment is hilarious, but in one case it temporarily halted the guy, but didn't stop him. Pretending I knew the gas station attendant who chatted with me about my ""family"" while we waited for the guy to leave did.

It's still unwanted attention and bad enough when I have to drive somewhere at night by myself that I now put on my husband's baseball cap with my hair up and wear a plaid man's jacket even in the summer after being followed by vehicles a couple of times late at night that I had to lose through defensive driving.

Also if you're a true crime buff like me you know that predatory types don't always care about age as much as how vulnerable they perceive someone to be and/or the rush of power they get over hurting others. Hence the whole issue of sexual assault in nursing homes sadly."
relationship_advice,ffooj09,t3_eu4ywl,1580079955.0,"I looked at your post history. It's a red flag parade, honestly.

Context is everything in whether or not to be worried about Google searches. There is a reason why these are sometimes used in court cases to show a pattern of intent. Other times they are easily explained. In your boyfriend's case given your post history and how oddly specific those searches were while presumably he wasn't there to study sex trafficking and HIV in prostitutes in Thailand for a term paper or think tank or even a novel he's writing it doesn't take a genius to figure out what he was up to. Yeah, he at least thought about going to a Thailand prostitute. Whether or not he did it is a whole other issue, but yeah he thought about it. I mean, were there also Google searches about ""What to do in Thailand"" or articles about ""Best food to try in Thailand?"" 

Really if you want your anxiety to stop you just end things now and walk away. You should've dumped the guy when he told you that you look like a baby and that's why he can't compliment you. Breaking up is not held to the same standards of a court case. You don't need an airtight ""This is why I'm leaving you"" reason or even really reason at all. You don't need to catch him cheating on your or confirm that he did sleep with a prostitute in Thailand or anything else at all really beyond, ""This no longer works me, goodbye."" Heck, you're free to tell the guy you are breaking up, because the sky is blue and the mountains are calling your name and his name wasn't called too for that matter.

If you want to walk away just walk away."

One of my favorite things in the world is sitting on my porch late at night after everything is shut down listening to the sound of the trains passing through my town. Although the train tracks are west of where I live,  and over 5 miles away, there's some sort of odd sound trick at night that makes it seem as if the train is passing by from the east behind the foot hills that are nearby. It's not just me that hears this. I've had multiple people ask me where the train is to the east that they can hear. It only does this at night after everything goes so still the sound sort of echoes and amplifies. It's eerie and beautiful, like a ghost train running through the canyons and trails where I hike sometimes. 

There's nothing weird about loving the peace and tranquility of the dark. Or if there is then here's to the weirdness!"

I mean, he didn't end up going with another woman after uninviting you - I've seen several of those posts here on Reddit - but it was still really shitty to talk it up, get you excited, invite you and then at the last minute say, ""Nope, you can't come now."" And it's not like he's giving you a logical reason. It's one day as you pointed out, you could have done other things, and he turned that down.

Really the only reason for this is that he decided he wanted to tell other women he's single while on vakay knowing he can come home to you after he has his fun OR he lined up someone to meet while he's out of the country. I saw your response in the comments about a previous sketchy incident with some other girl and him seeing her by herself and all.

Sorry, but my take is he's cheating on you. I bet he told his relatives some lie about why you aren't with him too."
TwoXChromosomes,ffiy9rd,t3_et3n1y,1579985680.0,"You are doing the right thing by pursuing this as a criminal matter, because this has become stalking and harassment at this point. He knows you don't want any contact with him, but he's doing it anyways. And has been for two years, so this person definitely gets something from the non-consent of it all. And quite possibly has other similar or worse crimes since at least in my experience assholes who enjoy nonconsensual sex acts of any kind, even yes sending dick pics, are also not the people who will listen to ""no"" about anything else. Unless maybe it comes from someone much bigger about the beat them into the ground with a 2X4. 

So yes, at this point he long ago gave up any right to not suffer consequences for this bullshit. Good for you and good for the detective/officer taking this seriously."
relationships,ffi93eh,t3_etrcr3,1579968246.0,"He does it because he's an abusive POS who is pushing your boundaries to find out how much abuse you will put up with and what else he can get away with. Some people enjoy hurting other people, because they are insane and this guy is one of  those.

The only thing you are doing wrong is not having dropped him immediately the first time he did that crap. Abusers don't need a ""reason"" - they need the thrill they get from hurting you and other people. To them it's like a drug and they need it. He has an addiction to hurting people and this is all you need to know and understand. 

The good news is this is easily remedied with a text that you don't ever want to see him again, followed by telling family and friends he's abusive and has been hurting you. And doubled down with a restraining order and calling the cops if he won't leave you alone.

Most abusers don't start out full-on beating you or punching you. They work up to it in steps to see whether you will put up with it and how silent you will stay. Also whether or not you will stay. It took an abusive ex of mine two years to work up to hitting me in the face, but there were huge red flags before that.

You need to leave and read the book by Lundy Bancroft ""Why Does He Do That?"" in order to understand the mindset of abusers and why you should leave them at the first red flag, not the thousandth one."
relationship_advice,ffhwosh,t3_ethhz1,1579957259.0,"That's one time too many - you needed to leave the first time she did it. You need to leave now. It IS abuse regardless of gender.

Please get out now and end things. And if you live together please go to the National Domestic Abuse Hotline  website and/or call them to find out the safest way to leave. Make sure you have witnesses to any breakup and do not let her come see you alone at all. Ever. 

And I say that, because she sounds like the type to explode, try to hurt you, then press charges that you abused her. So nope, make sure you have witnesses and are never alone with her and can account for yourself at all times. 

You can never trust someone once they put their hands on you in anger."
relationships,ffhw1ul,t3_etnohe,1579956496.0,"Tell your family when your sister pays you back the thousands of dollars she stole from you and thanks you for not turning her into police for identity theft maybe you two can have a relationship. Oh, and she needs to be fully clean - doing ""less"" drugs doesn't mean shit in addiction world. That's like when my dad used to want bonus points from my mom for not going to the bars every night and only doing so on weekends. He was still an alcoholic who couldn't be trusted until he got fully clean.

Also ""fucking junkie"" IS what she is since she stole from you repeatedly for her drugs. Stating the truth is harsh, but so what? It's nowhere near as harsh as her ruining your credit and leaving you with bills to pay that aren't yours.

In the meantime please put a credit freeze on your identity, pull your credit reports and make very sure there have been no other thefts or cards opened in your name. And if there are you need to report these to the fraud division of whatever card/account is opened and to the police as identity theft and push through charges regardless of what any other family says. The FTC website has a whole program for handling identity theft or you can go to personal finances and they can point you on how to do those things.

I don't know if your family knows the extent of what she did to you, so if they don't now is the time to fully out her about it to them. If they do then you need to ignore them completely, because they are enabling her and she either hasn't done the same to them or they have more money to pay it all off.

Either way, no. You are not wrong. My dad did finally get clean, but not before he had a big hand in making me and my family's life a fuck ton harder than it had to be, because money for food and clothing went to his booze instead until I was a teenager. And then the getting sober was its own nightmare. We did repair our relationship, but only after he got clean and did some serious amends to me and other family members.

That's what your sister needs to do and until then her pushing your family to have contact is likely more about getting access to quick cash from you again. Don't ever let her into your home and keep any valuables in your purse/on you to a minimum."
relationships,ffh9zru,t3_et6hj6,1579927460.0,"I'm going to be blunt here. You owe yourself and your own life more loyalty than you will ever owe any business. And I say this as someone who walked out of a 16-year job I thought I'd be at forever, but finally left after it damaged my health and sanity extensively. And if you work with an asshole for a boss who already doesn't respect you then nothing you say or do is going to make any difference if they decide to get mad at you for leaving for far better, brighter and greener pastures.

Stop thinking about how mad your boss is going to be and get mad that they would have kept you as a loyal employee IF they offered up common respect and the same level of pay and benefits. Your new job is a step up, so take it. It's also the kind of job that will likely open far more doors for you than a retail job with an abusive manager ever will. If you can give two weeks notice then give it calmly to your boss. If they flip out on you or are an asshole tell them calmly that you will then move up that resignation date and you just quit. Then you walk out and don't look back. 

Then you go kill it in that new job and in your spare time you come up with another game plan aka look at other places you could apply to just like you did to the new job you're going to now. You got this."

Also their reaction was so over the top it makes me more than slightly suspicious they were going to try something. Or guilt you into putting the backpack on so they could justify stealing from you.

relationships,ffgmbdn,t3_ethqmw,1579909553.0,"No. You do not ever want a relationship with anyone who has an addiction of any kind. He's admitted he has this problem, which means it's significant enough he's already gotten into trouble over it in the past. BUT if he's still gaming all it means is he's aware he has an addiction, but isn't yet truly serious about ending that addiction or he wouldn't game. At all. It's like an alcoholic saying, ""Yeah, I have a problem with alcohol and that's why I just make sure I only drink in a bar on Fridays now."" Addictions are things you have to cut out of your life altogether if you really want to end the addiction. Source: grew up with a parent with an alcohol addiction that didn't get fixed until he stopped drinking completely and avoided situations with alchol like bars and parties where his friends urged him to drink. 

And you've already been down this path once with your ex. If you get involved with this guy knowing he has a gaming addiction it becomes that saying, ""Definition of insanity - doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result."""

Neither of you were adults with the knowledge and life experience to stand up for yourselves or even know what was happening.

Maybe I watch too many crimes shows. Maybe I've had a few too many run-ins with cults and religious extremists, but I think you not bleeding that day possibly saved you from ending up in a compound somewhere in the remote wilderness where they keep razor wire fences and guards to stop people from leaving. At the very least I think they'd have insisted you get pregnant and then pressured you to stay with them where they could control you and any children you had.

Also the silent treatment is a huge no-no in my books. He didn't apologize or keep talking to you after that. He wasn't even upfront in that he didn't just come out and say, ""Look, I'm looking for an FWB or booty call and not a relationship, you okay with that?"" He went silent, then came back and you to try and get you to talk about sex in a different way. Then went silent again when you called him out about it.

So it's pretty clear his interest is in sex, not you. There is nothing wrong with this by the way IF you both want that and have been clear and upfront about it. But the way he's gone about it isn't okay.

Yes, stop responding and just block him and move on. One thing I found out a long time ago is you can often tell a lot about someone by how they handle a no from you - no matter how soft or casual that ""no"" or ""stop asking"" or whatever version of it there is.

relationships,ffe6v5t,t3_et15a1,1579838275.0,"You both needs couples counseling if this marriage is going to work. Your jealously and his lack of boundaries and communication will tear you two apart if it hasn't already.

You for losing your cool and flipping out at M when honestly your husband is the larger problem here. Also when your husband asked for couples counseling and you turned him down. You should have jumped at the chance to bring in a third party to mediate and explain to you both that boundaries and openness and full communication are vital and healthy. Your husband should have been including you more and you also need to find people to have friendships with outside of your marriage. If your life is full and you have plenty of people in it then you likely wouldn't have seen the friendship between them as such a threat. 

He also needs counseling and has some blame in this though, because you told him repeatedly you were not comfortable with the friendship and he didn't adequately address it or apply boundaries that would solve the issue. And then meeting up with M without telling you or even including you was not cool. M didn't know that clearly or she'd never have been so open with you about them going to the exhibit. And I find that weird. I also find it weird timing that now he tells you M is gay. Why then? Honestly I'm a little suspicious that he does have a crush on M although I don't get the same from her. I have a suspicion he hid your upset over their closeness and may even have given some excuse aka lie about why you didn't go with them.

So if you both are going to last in this relationship couples counseling and some serious work on navigating boundaries and learning to trust each other and be fully open and fully inclusive with each other. 

All I can tell you to do is ask him if he will now consider couples counseling. And if he won't go all you can do is get therapy for yourself, focus on building a life that isn't so dependent on him and wait for things to cool down. Personally I see you each had a hand in this mess though and I'm not sure it's the only issue you both have been having, because it seems like there were other issues that maybe weren't as apparent before this."

That's not love. It's a need to control and he sounds abusive and more than a little unhinged. It's not that he ever loved you. He just sees you as his possession to control as he pleases and you showing autonomy by breaking up with him and finding someone else is driving him wild, because he feels a loss of control.

You need to realize your thought processes and standards and morals are not his. Grab the book by Lundy Bancroft on ""Why Does He Do That"" as well as Gavin de Becker's book ""The Gift of Fear"" and read up on stalkers and people who persist even when it doesn't make sense to do so.

The ""love"" they feel is very different and is more about controlling a possession. I had an abusive ex who cheated on me, was emotionally and later physically abusive. He was furious when he found out I'd gotten married to someone else a year after we'd been broken up and I'd moved to another state and city. He showed up my work place having applied for a job and been hired just so he could be around me and try to persuade me to leave my then husband. A year later the nutbar went so far as to follow me to another state and get my work place and apply for a job there. It wasn't love. It was control he wanted. It ended with him being frog-marched out the door by security guards and later having a ""talk"" with family members who were law enforcement to finally get him to leave me alone.

So no, you didn't mis-remember anything, but your ex sure hopes you did and she's not about to put in writing or admit anything was her fault. 

Block her on everything and move on with your life. You don't forget or make up/misunderstand the kind of shit you describe her doing. No one does unless they've suffered serious amnesia or a head injury and then there will be other people to back up that you were irrational in that time period/injured in some way."

This is a very dumb assumption on people's part, but maybe ""less conventional = more willing to not put up with shit"" or something.

Case in point when I was younger I got harassed a ton as a natural blonde and being small. Then I died my hair a bright red and man the switch was astonishing. I still got the occasional compliment or wolf whistle, BUT they would do it from a respectful distance and if I frowned or looked at the guy he'd often apologize or keep a giant distance between us. As if me with my fire engine red hair suddenly could take on anyone when I hadn't been able to as a blonde.

I kept my hair died red for years partially for that reason (also because red really suits me though) and at one point put turquoise streaks through it. That was fun. Then I developed an allergy to hair dye so I let it all go back to my regular blonde. By then I was old enough I didn't get hassled as much although yeah, again it was like a switch was flipped and suddenly I was approachable/open to more disrespect.

I still miss my red hair though. :("
TwoXChromosomes,ffcf6ji,t3_est4es,1579798148.0,"Frugal, no I don't care. I've never dated someone for what they can give me material-wise. In fact, I was always really uncomfortable with the big spender type of individual. I don't like imbalances of power when it comes to money or anything else for that matter in a relationship. I want an equal and a partner to share things with. In fact this is a good thing about my husband in that he doesn't needlessly spend money we don't have and neither do I, but at the same time we do occasionally enjoy a night out. We are on the same level in terms of money and earning and so forth. We have each at times been the primary breadwinner while the other one went through an illness/job loss/other life circumstances.

It suits us both just fine. Currently I bring in the money while Hubs is getting treatments for a medical issue and can't do much. It is what it is, but he has carried me before so now I carry him. This is an equal partnership in the best sense of the word and it's one reason we've been married for over 20 plus years. 

There is a huge difference though about being frugal and being cheap or worst of all an out-and-out mooch/using someone for their money and material comforts. I've dated all three of those types until I met my husband. Frugal, not a big deal. The second one, nah for me and the third one most definitely never. I only dated one person like that for a short time when I was young and nope, not putting up with the mooch who was happy to use me and his other friends and family without so much as a thank you or a reason to be mooching. He didn't work, because he didn't want to and that's just not okay in my books.

The advice telling the woman to fake an expensive lifestyle was really dumb advice. 

It also depends on where you live. I met my husband in L.A. We both had people try to date us for our income, but the city does draw a lot of ""get rich quick"" types. Where we live now people are just happy to be left alone to quietly lead their lives and most couples are on a parity in terms of income and have been together for a long time. If you give a shit about the trappings of wealth you don't come to my town or live in it.

Also please document every instance of this. Sorry as a supervisor or manager you do not want to be ""soft"" on blatant disrespect of you as someone in a higher position than a new employee who should be more worried about doing a good job and keeping his job than in intimidating someone who is in a position of authority above him.

Bluntly speaking if you have enough power and have done well enough to be made a supervisor then you are not there to appease people or go soft on them. You are there to make sure all of your staff are comfortable, competent and work is getting done.

Getting out of a toxic situation never is selfish BUT toxic people will always make you feel bad for doing so, because you take away what they need - to pull someone else down to make themselves feel better.

Also as someone who had to learn this the hard way I'm going to tell you right now that life does not reward you for staying with a toxic person.

Block him on everything and tell the false guilt to bugger off, because it IS a false guilt. You staying with him and rewarding his bad behaviors will only encourage more bad behavior from him. To that end staying with him and letting him manipulate you actually hurts him more since he needs to learn now that there are consequences for his actions and that if he mistreats someone they will no longer be in his life.

Weird and unbelievably annoying. I even yelled at one coworker who started to whine about it every damned day until I told him off.

And it isn't just women this happens to. When my oldest son decided to move states for his company he complained to me that suddenly all of his female friends, acquaintances and coworkers were flirting and/or told him they were interested in him. He even had one girl he'd had a crush on for a year throw a tantrum on him when she started to get interested and asked him to stay for her. Fortunately he asked me about it and I pointed out he'd be making nearly twice as much as his current position and in a state that had cheaper living.

In this aspect you need to hold fast to your boundaries and not let him manipulate you into coming back into your life, because he will damage your kids if he's already been angry, nasty and passive aggressive to your children. On that end let the Mama Bear out in full force as in, ""I will end you myself if you ever so much as look sideways at my child again! Now LEAVE.""

Get angry and block this guy on everything. If he persists in trying to reach you, keep a note of everything and then go get a restraining order.

Also you can always dial 911 and ask them to do a wellness check on him. That means either he will get put on the correct lines to get mental health help OR he will learn that is a manipulation he cannot use.

Also grab the book by Gavin de Becker, the Gift of Fear, and read up on how to deal with the person who persists even after you tell them to leave you alone. You need to cut this guy out of your life completely and refuse to allow him any control or contact with you or your kids at all. Every time you respond to him you buy yourself another 3 to 6 months of his manipulation and open your children, especially your youngest up to someone abusive to them and to you.

Also just to clear things up in case he tries to tell you if he kills himself you can be held legally responsible, no you can't. There has been one case of a woman prosecuted, because she not only knew an ex was suicidal - she encouraged the kid to get into his truck and kill himself, and when he exited, she insisted he get back in the truck and kill himself. She stayed on the phone while he killed himself and at no time tried to get him help, call police or his family. THAT is why she was prosecuted and that is very different than if your ex tries to hurt or kill himself simply because you stood up for yourself and your kids and got him out of your lives.

Also be sure to tell close family and friends exactly why you broke up with this guy and how he is trying to play the pity card and they need to be on the lookout for him if he tries to contact them.

Your mom can tell those other women if they want to go drinking with strange men who aren't their husbands and courting a DWI or worse that's their prerogative, not hers.

Edited to add: Tell your mom that the same people who would scold her for turning down an invitation she are also usually the same people who, if something bad did happen, would then be more than happy to scold her for what the hell was she thinking going to a party with booze and a bunch of strange men/drinking while hiking/driving while drunk and how it's all her fault something bad happened.

Since there will always be two groups of people to tell a person how wrong they are if they did or didn't do something, then the best solution is always the one that feels right to you and your instincts."
relationships,fe41pvv,t3_ekk8d5,1578854950.0,"There is no ""fighting for us"" when someone is emotionally and verbally abusive to you. There is only manipulation. Source: I had this happen with my first serious relationship. We broke up, because I finally got fed up his bullshit. He played the whole ""sad but accepting"" thing. At first. Then when I didn't run after him like he thought I would he ramped up the pity machine to me and my friends and family. To the point I stupidly decided since he had decided to ""fight"" for us after all I'd give him another chance.

Worst mistake of my life. 

The fact is you thought he'd be an asshole to you in breaking up and that would have made things easy, it would have justified your decision right? Not this sad acceptance thing in which you now doubt yourself and feel he loves you and are now like, ""Wait, why didn't he at least argue or call me names or anything?""

You're kind of being played and you're playing yourself. So right now write down a list of all the things he ever said to you that are mean and made you feel bad. Read those over and over again and ask yourself each time you do, ""Would someone who loved me, really loved me in a sane and healthy way that is, have said these things to me?"" 

Do that until it dawns on you that breaking up with someone who insults you personally is always for the best, no matter how ""nice"" they act or what they do in the times they aren't insulting you."

Like, I am currently having a hard time understanding why the fucking hell you didn't walk out the door right then and there, go report him for animal abuse and then block him while telling everyone to avoid this psycho.

I can just imagine what he's going to do to his kids if any woman is ever stupid enough to have one with him. And that poor cat. Please report him and break up with this loser.

That said I'm going to recommend  you check out Chump Lady's website  [https://www.chumplady.com/](https://www.chumplady.com/) before you decide to do anything, read her various articles and really think over why you think this guy's words should be trusted over his actions in any way.

Also at 50 if he can't figure out that developing a ""habit"" of flirting with other women is going to tank a relationship then he's immature and dumb enough he never will. Yes, yes, hindsight is alllllll so illuminating - if one is maybe 18 and pulls this kind of crap.

Look, the cheating is bad enough BUT the larger thing you need to be looking at here is how incredibly selfish this guy is. He tried to make you think you were crazy and that YOU were the problem all along and he still is. The only reason you two were having a tough time was because he was distancing himself due to pursuing her to begin with. He caused all of this, you didn't, so now it's time to let him reap what he has sown so to speak.

Don't get back together with him, because he's a liar and looks out for himself first. This guy will never have your back when you truly need it. That is not who you want to go through life with, trust me.

And gambling with your health and life? Totally unforgivable in my books. So you got an STD that's curable and not one that can kill you *this time.* Do you really want to keep playing Russian Roulette with this guy hoping the next person he chooses to have unprotected sex with won't have something worse? Right now, I know it hurts, but maybe try reading up on what could have happened to you if he'd given you something far, far worse. And I think you won't be feeling like maybe you should be giving him a second chance. You'll be as angry at him as if he'd started up the car, rolled it towards a cliff, then jumped out and yelled at you good luck in stopping the car before it goes over the cliff. Because yeah, that's pretty much just what he did by gasligting you the whole time he was fucking at least one woman you know of without using protection while having sex with you. Seriously,

Also this woman is just the one you know about. If he could lie about that, what else has he lied to about? Who else has he lied about? And really do you and he both thing a few therapy sessions are going to turn him into not a selfish asshat who puts himself first above someone else's emotional and physical safety and health? I don't.

Tell him to look at your name long and hard every time he thinks about lying to the next woman he's with then block and delete him and move on, thankful you dodged a massive bullet.

P.S. Look up the sunk cost fallacy. People do NOT 1 for 1 get more kind, less selfish, more trustworthy over time just because of time spent or time invested in them. If they did he'd have done this all to you in the beginning of your relationship, not 7 years down the line. Selfish people might learn not to be so selfish, maybe, but others don't. Do you really want to bank your health and happiness long term on someone who has shown you what he is capable of?

Edited to add - if he couldn't figure out just how amazing you truly are after 7 years of being together then really he never will. You're just the backup plan as it dawns on him you're the only one who might continue to put up with his shit."
relationships,fdn7ou3,t3_em7g8o,1578579533.0,"No, you absolutely did the right thing. This was the beginning of what sounds like a classic abusive relationship. Abusers don't start out abusive and mean all at once or they'd never get anyone to stay. They can often times especially sweet and romantic in the beginning to lure you in. It's called love-bombing, look that up. It's not that regular people won't do those thoughtful and romantic gestures too, BUT a sane person, a good person doesn't switch back and forth so readily between serious anger and berating and bullying the person they claim to love over absolutely irrational nonsense to being sweet then back to controlling and full of rage.

I'm sure you wondered sometimes if you were even dating the same person and felt confused and afraid when his rage would come out of nowhere and be set off by nothing.  And then grateful and relieved when it ended and he did something nice. Until the next time he switched back to being mean.

Also from what you describe he was pretty much ramping up his mean behaviors more and more as time went on. That's because he felt more secure in establishing control over you. That's not insecurity that does that. Maybe some bullies and assholes are insecure, but not all insecure people do the things you describe, because they're afraid you'll leave them or they aren't good enough.

The fact is also abusers don't stay abusive. At least not in the beginning. They very well understand how to pull back and play nice when they realize they've pushed you too far. It's called the Cycle of Abuse. That cycle just gets shorter and shorter until there's no pretense left and you are so beaten down and controlled you just accept it..

Some resources that may help you - Lundy Bancroft's book ""Why Does He Do That?"" and his videos on YouTube. Also go to [loveisrespect.org](https://loveisrespect.org) and look at their information. Also look up the Cycle of Abuse to understand why he could be so Jekyll and Hyde. 

I can't emphasize enough to you how important stability is in a relationship and how much a truly sane individual, one you want in your life permanently, does not have these completely erratic bouts of meanness and anger over nothing peppered with grand gestures of ""OH, but I DO love you! Here is this bribe to make you forget that I just ruined your entire day/week/self-esteem/respect.""  

Be happy you walked away at nine months. Do not get back with him no matter how much he love bombs you if he tries. Part of dating is learning who a person is once the honeymoon period wears off Yours has worn off. This is who he is. Someone who can mean and bullying out of literally nowhere and over nothing. 

You absolutely did the right thing. Look up the resources I've given you. Do not stay in contact with him. Don't let him hoover you back in with promises of change or excuses. Time and distance will show you that you should have left much sooner, but it's not too late yet. So keep running away from him and take the time to process what happened and what the red flags really were and don't tolerate them in the future. You'll be all right.

I was once in your shoes. I left and came to realize his version of ""love"" wasn't mine and wasn't something I wanted. You will too. You did good by yourself now keep doing that."

And then even that falls to the wayside as you immerse yourself completely in a new life and learn to put yourself first again. You've survived so much, you deserve happiness and to be able to live without fear and without the confusion of love mixed in with anger or pain. 

Remember that, tell yourself that, it will be okay. You will get there. Lean on your support team, continue therapy, look up resources like Lundy Bancroft's ""Why Does He Do That"" and [loveisrespect.org](https://loveisrespect.org) and other resources for leaving an abusive relationship.

You've come this far, don't stop. If you need to write down and keep a list with you of why you are leaving to pull out and read in those times when your heart and mind try to trick you into thinking ""Maybe it wasn't so bad,"" I recommend you do so. It got me through the worst of leaving at the beginning.

Savor everything good you can, even the little things, especially the little things that remind you it's good to be alive.

Lisbeth Salander - of course

Grace Hanadarko from the ""Saving Grace"" TV series played by Holly Hunter. It's an old series, but she definitely broke the mold for dark female lead characters.

Also don't listen to management if they try to get you to stay on the promise of more money and/or work. Once you have to leave a job or choose to do so, because they've been crappy to you staying just never works out.

Whatever you get though practice with it. Practice, practice and practice some more until you feel comfortable in being able to reach for it automatically and deploy it under a variety of conditions. And I advocate that for every form of self-defense someone might choose since not all people have access to guns or pepper spray if they live in an area where it's illegal.

Also as someone who conceal carries I will add guns won't work in every situation. When I was charged by the dog I describe in my prior post I had my conceal carry in a holster on my hip. There wasn't time to draw a gun, it's illegal to fire in town where I was AND more importantly there was a teenage boy in the yard calling to the dog as it broke its chain and charged us. There were also nearby houses. Same with a near-carjacking/abduction in a park. Kids playing nearby and a busy highway that would have been right in the path of any bullets  fired.

So a gun isn't always the answer. And again you want to train, train, train and train and keep training if you have one. Or for any form of self-defense.

Stay safe out there and make sure you always check for reviews and information on anything you choose to use as a self-defense option. And again train with it. And you'll be better off than many."

In our society I think that's a good thing BTW. Why would any driver want to risk a police report on how he or she attempted to hurt customers? 

Please do file a report with Uber and the police. This guy tried to convince you both that he wasn't going the wrong way when you and he clearly knew he was and he only turned around when you told him you were calling the cops. If he had been ""innocent"" he'd have pulled over, verified the information, apologized to the both of YOU and given you that ride to your destination. Also not erasing it in an attempt to hide what he did. 

The fact is if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck. Or in this case an attempt to take what he probably assumed were two drunk girls who would be too timid/non-confrontational to speak up until it was too late to do so. 

So screw anyone who tells you not to make a fuss. Make a fuss. Your personal safety is more important than someone else's ""feelings"" will ever be. Best case scenario this guy just learned to not be an idiot and try to argue with the customer and hide the fact they don't know what they're doing - that's not a bad thing.

I can personally vouch for the effectiveness of the pepper gel, I did use on a large 100-pound plus dog that broke it's chain and came at me and my dog walking past its house.

And I say this as someone who had experienced violence involving guns before AND whose instructor when I finally went for my conceal carry license was nothing but positive and patient and gentle the entire time. We drilled gun safety for quite awhile before he even let me touch the gun, and even when I was sweating and scared he was nothing but patient with me. Totally the opposite of Jim, so don't let one person who can't teach their way out of a paper bag discourage you.

Second, what worked for me was starting off with a .22 revolver. It was light, easy to shoot, and they are not complicated guns. You will get a lot of people scoffing at this, because they watch too many Dirty Harry/Action movies and want the fantasy of only big guns with big bullets count for anything BUT it really did give me confidence to start out there and work my way up to higher calibers.

Third, find someone with patience and understanding to walk you through all of the basics from safety to firing. Bob shouldn't have sent you out to test the gun out on their range. What he should have done is recommend a good instructor - and that instructor was clearly not Jim.

Don't be embarrassed by someone else's lack of ability to teach. Don't be embarrassed, because you need to overcome a particular fear. We all have to start somewhere and what you want to do is look for people who realize that and will work with you and not against you.

relationship_advice,fcxtvpf,t3_ej6rfz,1578070381.0,"Contacting an ex is not going to help you and it is more likely a subconscious stall tactic, or maybe not so subconscious. You already know the relationship makes you unhappy and that you feel better when your boyfriend isn't around. Holding off by telling yourself you just need this one more thing just delays what is probably the inevitable.

On that alone you can end things and walk away. This doesn't mean he's wrong or bad or that you are wrong or bad, but rather that this relationship for whatever the reason is simply not one that is making you happy and improving your life. And that's really what a good relationship is all about. Getting an stranger's opinion will not change that.

And breaking up is not held to the same standards as a court of law. You don't need to come up with an airtight guilty of all charges reason. My first marriage ended, because we married too young, too fast and later admitted in therapy that we had nothing in common. He didn't want to come home and I didn't want him home, because honestly we had nothing to talk about and little interest in each other's lives. We didn't demonize each other, we admitted to our faults, we thanked the therapist and we filed for divorce.

We were much more careful the second time around and are now married to different people that make us very happy.

Just sit down and ask yourself why you're staying and what it is that makes YOU unhappy. If he's not willing to change or address anything, because he's happy with it and you aren't then what is the point of trying to stay or find reasons to leave? Just leave.

You don't need anyone to validate your wanting to leave and definitely not an ex, because the issues between them may or may not be different and she may or may not welcome any contact.

He should have spoken up when the dad made that horrible comment at the dinner table. Who even does that?????

I'm sorry OP, but this is a defining moment in whether you stay with this guy or not. I'm a little suspicious about how heavily influenced your boyfriend is by his father. It wasn't lost on me the only one he stood up to in the family was his sister when really he should have gotten up from the table with you and told his family you were both going during that bogus ""prayer"" by his dad.

It's time to find out just how influenced is he by his father and really where does he see the relationship going. I have a suspicion the pressure to have you convert religions is just around the corner and this may have been a test run to see if they could pressure you to come around.

Or maybe they're just that awful, but your boyfriend's lack of support in all of this and his anger that you refused to stay and let them continue to berate you is really not okay. There's no way he could possibly think he could have fixed someone calling you a devil and another family member deliberately touching you in a disrespectful manner during your prayers.

TwoXChromosomes,fcqycjm,t1_fcoz6iw,1577894054.0,"Right? That was my first thought too. Why is a teacher sexualizing children and blasting his own perverted thoughts all over the school and other teachers? That man needed to be fired on the spot, not backed up by shaming a 12-year-old child. 

Disgusting. Good on Nanna for speaking up, but it's too bad no one went and screamed at the teachers to get their minds out of the damned gutter and stop blasting their own issues at the children they were supposed to be teaching."
offmychest,fcqqwwb,t3_ei7tnt,1577890791.0,I miss him too.
TwoXChromosomes,fcqp2e8,t1_fcqi09u,1577889864.0,"Yeah, out where I live as well. I hate going to Walmart and looking at ""the wall"" of missing persons. 

I had a near abduction/carjacking incident over a year ago at a park close to my home. I've shared the experience elsewhere on Reddit, but basically guy snuck up on me after I'd put my dog in the car and was leaving, demanded a ride, then told me he wasn't asking and got in my face after I refused. 

I was able to start yelling to attract the attention of some workers in the park that knew me and they chased him off. Still scary and I know longer park my car where someone can hide.

It isn't paranoia if they're really out to get you. And unfortunately yeah, some people are."

Besides what is the possible worst thing that could ever happen in choosing NOT to interact with strangers or to leave if something feels off? Nothing, nothing at all. 

Stay safe and have a wonderful New Year."
TwoXChromosomes,fcnlvpx,t3_ei48me,1577813988.0,"No, if you felt something was off and you understood perfectly what those people were saying then I'd say you were right to get the hell out of there. Worst case scenario, alone and in a remote location you were overly cautious. But that's never a bad thing to be and don't let anyone tell you it is.

I don't know if anyone followed you from the first gas station or not, but given that there is a current case going on in Alabama where a UFC fighter's stepdaughter was abducted and killed under similar circumstances (gas station late at night) I think you're fine to be cautious and aware.

There's zero reason for anyone to come at you or approach you in a gas station late at night anyways. Good on you for listening to your gut."
TwoXChromosomes,fcngzfx,t1_fcm3rbd,1577811508.0,"Ah yes, pulled into one of these one day. It was early morning and my regular mechanic wasn't open quite yet, but I just needed to have them check if a tire was going flat or not. The guy told me that was fine, but that I needed new brakes before I got hurt. That they were about to fail. I told him that was odd since I'd just gotten the brakes replaced over at (name of local guy, not part of chain) but I'd be sure to have him take a look. I then drove off.

I went to my regular mechanic once he was open. Turns out I had a nail in the tire and yes, it was going flat. When I told him about the brakes comment he was not amused and called up the Jiffy Lube to talk to a manager about their tactics."
TwoXChromosomes,fcngky5,t3_ehqrau,1577811275.0,"I've had this experience myself with places trying to ""upsell"" me on services I did not need, even to the point of lying about it. Yeah, Jiffy I'm looking at you with your, ""You need to get your brakes replaced before you get hurt"" guy. (Not true, I had just gotten them replaced.)  I finally found two places on the recommendation of friends who are honest. And I know they are, because one will recommend the other if it's something they feel the other place can do better plus they both will tell me exactly the same thing about whatever the issue is.

Neither one has a shop puppy though, but one of them does have a vintage mustang he's done a lot of work on. I quietly drool and pine for it as he works on my car and he loves to teach me all about cars as he works."

AskWomen,fc9rafa,t3_egniib,1577557027.0,"When I was in my early 20s, just out of college I worked for a nonprofit organization. At the time their ""published and award winning author"" who worked as a paid consultant for them had had a project for two months and hadn't gotten around to it yet. My boss gave it to me and told him she had, because he was busy with other things. He was fine with that, even stating, ""Great, it's a dumb project, she can have it. Good luck.""

So I spent a month doing the project, staying late and weekends to finish it. Turned it in. It got rave reviews from the CEO and Board of the nonprofit after the project got some nice results. I got a $25 bonus and nice plaque as a thank you, but that was it. I didn't get a promotion and it was a fairly minor project that wasn't going to save the world or anything.

Word must have gotten back to the consultant however, because two days after that he came into my office and asked me in the most snotty condescending voice I've ever heard, ""Just who do you think you are?"" And then dissolved into a puddle of tears while going on and on about how ""You are a nobody. You are JUST out of college! That was MY project, MY PROJECT. You've never won any awards for anything. How DARE they and how DARE you!"" 

You'd have thought I'd stolen a damned academy award from the guy. He was later let go, because his go-to was tantrum mode anytime he felt the limelight wasn't on him."
TwoXChromosomes,fc9mqlh,t3_egkqnk,1577555006.0,"You rock. You just helped catch a predator. Screw anyone who sends you shade, because the love and admiration you are getting from me and others like me to have spoken up is tenfold what anyone who has done that shit themselves could ever be.

You did everything right by the way. You held your ground. You reported it to the police. You insisted people do their jobs whose responsibility it IS to provide a safe place for people just shop and try on clothes. 

AND you did not put yourself in immediate danger by confronting a man who feels it is his right to film women AND minors in various states of undress without their knowledge or consent. (Not that the minors could have given consent legally even if they'd said yes.)  The fact is if you'd confronted the guy and he had hurt or attacked you or followed you out or been waiting for you outside and you then got hurt you'd get just as much if not more people telling you, ""For god's sake, WHY did you confront a predator? A criminal? What were you thinking? Why my cousin/friend/friend's friend got stabbed for intervening....""

So to anyone reading OP's post do exactly what she did. Hold your ground. Insist it be reported to the police. Don't try to confront someone breaking the law by yourself. 

Added bonus - if OP had confronted the guy he'd likely have deleted everything on his phone then disappeared, to resurface and do it again somewhere else. This way he probably thinks he's gotten away with it and is going to be in for a very nasty New Year's surprise. As he should be. 

Again OP, you rock!"
relationship_advice,fc0mehi,t3_efa21s,1577294487.0,"Look, I'm Ms. Paranoid AF about things like people one doesn't or barely knows showing up in unexpected places BUT in this case you did tell him where you worked. And you made a point to him of being alone and blue for Christmas. And you had already tried one get-together that didn't work out, showing a willingness by both parties to meet up. 

These things combined to me put this more into the ""Let's do something nice to cheer up OP,"" level than anything weird or wrong given the overall context of your post."
