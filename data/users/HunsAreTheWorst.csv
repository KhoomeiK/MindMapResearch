fatlogic,ffhp81j,t3_etbmyx,1579946553.0,"I think I'm starting to struggle with ED logic rather than fatlogic right now. People have been making little concerned comments just lately, which I've just put down to - well, nothing. They know I have an ED diagnosis, so I figured they're just being overly concerned. But the past week has not been that good. I'm constantly justifying to myself choices that I know are not healthy ones.

The FAs are wrong. Nothing drops the pounds off like not eating very much. I'm happy I'm in the 130s now, but a bit worried about just *how* happy I am about it, if that makes sense. 

But, I made it to see my therapist this week. I was honest. I've also told my partner, and while he's not a micromanager, I know he'll low key keep an eye on things. I'm seeing my RD next week. Sigh. A depressingly big part of me is not keen on this whole honesty and health approach right now."

People didn't really do this where I grew up (elsewhere in Europe), so I only started getting it when I moved to the UK. Where I'm from people used to say that if a person is just randomly smiling for no reason they're either drunk, mad or American.

The one I hate most is when people say something along the lines of ""Smile - it may never happen!"" I had a university professor who always greeted me with that. If someone seems genuinely upset, they're probably upset for a reason. Leave them the fuck alone. If someone is minding their bloody business in whatever facial expression they happen to currently have - leave them the fuck alone, too.

(Important but can't afford it at the moment.) I must admit I've never taken an Uber in my life, so I wouldn't know how much that'd be.

fatlogic,ff76w3z,t1_ff69u2l,1579642300.0,"I did put on a lot of weight while on Seroquel, but I think a bit part of it was that life was chaos at the time. I was freshly out of the psych ward, had a ton of new meds to take, and it all felt like wallowing through treacle with a head full of cotton. I don't really even remember those years that well. I probably ate a lot, yes, since that's what I've always done when things are bad. But while that might be the physical mechanism to the weight gain, I feel it is a bit simplistic, since people often aren't at the height of their life management skills in general when having to go on new neuroleptics."
fatlogic,ff7359u,t3_ervuu1,1579640181.0,"Boo: Foot's still sore. Not feeling better at all so far, maybe even worse. Can't really walk at all.

Yay: I found a sitting down exercise video that actually got my heart rate into some sustained cardio range (it was a sitting down HIIT with weights, but honestly I skipped the downtime periods as I wanted to see if cardio without feet would finally work). 

Boo: 99% of people in Youtube exercise videos are way too annoying to watch/listen to, even if their work outs might be great. Granted, my sample size isn't huge, but so far the 1% is pretty much solely occupied by Yoga With Adriene, who is only occasionally slightly annoying.

Yay: My appetite seems to naturally be creeping down with less exercise, which is helpful. Weight has still gone down this week a bit. I'm hovering around the top of my healthy BMI range now.

Boo: My mood is pretty shit, and my motivation is suffering. I haven't seen my therapist since November. I have an appointment with her this week, but it looks like I won't be able to go, because stupid foot."

To be honest, I don't know. My PTSD comes with a fair trickling of dissociative issues, so I sometimes have no idea what exactly has happened when things have been bad.

They'll just say I got upset - and my mind fills in whatever would be the most embarrassing thing I could possibly have done, so thanks. The times when I do remember, at least sort of, it can be anything from me getting quietly anxious without anything visible, to getting mildly dissociated (like stuck inside my head, kind of just staring at something and reactions and speaking gets very hard) to having a stupid, embarrassing panic attack of crying and hyperventilating.

Well, it's not that bad, but I'm feeling generally frustrated and annoyed with everything, including myself and my own annoyance and frustration. It was a nice, sunny, cold day here today. I've never wanted to go for a walk more! I'm also full on catastrophizing and convinced this'll end up becoming a chronic issue and I'll be unfit forever, which is a tad dramatic - on my *third day* with a sore foot.

Since I can't really walk, I'm obviously using up less calories. Even my optimistic Fitbit is giving me numbers in the 1500s or 1600s, despite me doing some upper body exercise (and lazy floor yoga). I've managed to stick to under 1400 Kcal, and just don't have the motivation or inclination to try any lower.

Some positive stuff to counteract the gloom:

\-  I have a new cheerleader! My husband's elderly auntie has learnt to use social media, and started messaging me. I've only met her once, but she's very supportive, interested and chatty, and clearly an active elderly person, who likes to look after her health.

\- I've bought myself a new ring, which arrived today. I was pretty heavy when we got married (a long time ago), so my wedding ring hasn't fitted in ages. I've tended to use my engagement ring instead. Lately it's been dropping off my hand a lot, and I'm worried I'll lose it, so I just went online and ordered a cheap band a couple of sizes smaller. (Don't want to have anything resized as I'm still trying to lose.) It fits. It's nice. I think it's the smallest ring I've owned since I was a child."

Definitely. It's great if it works for you, and it sounds like you're doing it properly. I think it's easier to do a poor job and fool yourself without a food scale, though. I've used one for so long (not even just when I've been losing weight) that it's second nature, and I get a bit itchy inside from the vagueness of guesswork I need to sometimes do estimating. The scales just sit on the kitchen counter. I but a plate or bowl on it, zero it, pop in the food, and get the weight - so it's not exactly hard work."

That doesn't work even when you're blissfully unaware of how muh you suck at estimating. I think the problem for many with estimating is that you forget how many of these little things you let pass. That's why I agree that even using a generic MFP entry is better, even if it might be inaccurate, because the act of tracking alone let's you see what exactly you're eating."

My husband's not interested in losing weight, but he seems happy enough that I am. A year ago I had a higher BMI than he did, but his is now the higher one. He's never been one to comment on my weight when I've been big, but does give me compliments on the loss, which is nice.

While he's not in this with me, he's perfectly happy to eat whatever I'm eating when I'm cooking. He'll make less healthy stuff for himself when we're eating separately, and he buys snacks that he likes but knows I don't, and I think he hits the other snacks when he's at work. I really appreciate it, as I try not to keep too much temptation around me. He comes for walks with me, bought me a Fitbit and has not made a single discouraging comment about any of my weight/fitness pursuits. 

I do find myself wishing he'd get interested about his own health, though. He's borderline obese at the moment, I think. He takes a medication (for life, most likely) that already increases his risk of things like diabetes. He's about ten years younger than his dad was when he died of a stroke. So I get quietly frustrated when I see him eat a whole bag of candy as a snack, and how he wants to spend all his free time gaming. He's not even fatlogicked, he just admits he's lazy and shrugs.
