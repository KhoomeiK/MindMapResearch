happy,fdgly0y,t1_fdgl05h,1578401767.0,"Always lead by example. Not a single person will ever follow your lead unless you are genuine. Addicts can smell lack of integrity a mile away. Your own sobriety is the greatest power of example you possess. Every day you stay sober, is what allows others to see that it is possible. You can't offer advice unless you've walked the walk. Listen and empathize, we don't like to be told what to do unless it comes from a source that is non judgmental, non critical and ESPECIALLY non condescending. Be honest and caring and don't let anyone try to sell lies. The only thing that matters in sobriety is ruthless honesty but they will have to want to do the work. AA was fantastic because it is based on attraction, not promotion. Offer up the benefits and let them decide if they want it or not and if they fall down, don't judge. Just be consistent in your support. The ones who want what you have will make their way. Good luck and thanks for all you do :)"
