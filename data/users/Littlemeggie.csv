And I can focus on my own creative work for the first time in years!

AskReddit,fcuvyi3,t1_fcultj4,1577989644.0,"British here, it's now my second year living in Austria and I love it!. The food is fantastic, great wines and beer. Lovely trains and public transportation is all very good value. People are friendly and love to speak English. The water from the taps comes from the mountains and is better than bottled. Fresh air, local foods, culture, music. The weather is very clearly seasonal which I enjoy coming from a country that's just kind of grey all year!.
Some things to be aware of, nepotism is strong when it comes to getting a job and if you don't speak good German it can be difficult. But once you get your foot in the door it's all good...just takes perseverance."
Dogfree,fcuj06d,t1_fcu4sa6,1577982090.0,"Yep. I was also using the whistle the instant the dog started barking, even if the owner was home. It doesn't hurt the dog at all. It's really bad for the dogs health to be barking like this constantly...I had the discipline to help the dog, even if it's owner didn't."
Dogfree,fcsin58,t3_eil28e,1577917223.0,My neighbor had a dog that she would leave alone in the house all day and it would stress bark all day. I bought a dog whistle and trained it to not bark through the wall. You have to be consistent and have the whistle on hand at all times. The instant you hear the dog start...one long hard blast of the whistle from your side if the wall until it stops barking. It took about 5 weeks but totally worked. No more barking which I'm sure was just as stressful for the dog as it was for us.
