niceguys,fe32lsz,t1_fdzo30y,1578845295.0,"That's your personal opinion. I definitely wouldn't want to date someone with a mental illness who poses a threat to both herself and her surroundings ever. Yes, I'm talking about THAT kind of mental illnesses, many of which go undiagnosed, then the person ends up killing someone because ""he was a demon!!!"", not the ""benign"" ones which cause more problems to the sufferers than anyone else.

Besides, a girl who's stalking her ex almost certainly has some form of mental illness as well and as such that's something I don't want to have anything to do with.

Oh and my ableism? lol, I'm pretty much borderline autistic, but whatever."

niceguys,fdewey6,t3_ekr7bb,1578348004.0,A teacher?! Graduated from UCLA?!?! Seeing his tired brains' (his what?!) effort wasted on a mediocre butt?! Sad thing is that even if by some stroke of miracle this guy would manage to hook up with a real-life Barbie doll (like he seems to wish) chances are that he'd grow really unhappy next to her in record time. And he doesn't know this. At all.
niceguys,fdevt93,t1_fddpw82,1578347646.0,Yeah. He didn't seem to pretend to be nice (nor paid lip service to being nice) at all.

Yeah, some are always pushing this harmful agenda that asserts that only a particular group can be threatened at a given time. If I'm someone who doesn't fit their agenda, I can't be possibly threatened and am only trying to diminish the problem. Unfortunately this will not make me more sympathetic to their cause, quite the contrary in fact."

What I mean (and what all those idiots who have downvoted me into oblivion didn't understand) is that if you're engaged in a quality/deep conversation with someone, you abruptly break it off and then only reply a day or two later (with no excuse whatosever), you can get away with it if you do it once. But if you do this twice, I don't think any guy would tolerate that."

What can I say, being eliminated has happened to me too, although it wasn't effective immediately."
niceguys,fdecs38,t1_fd8qjin,1578336196.0,"Well yeah, doing this once surely aids in generating a lot of ""quality"" material for this sub, yeah. But I still think that keeping a guy without a reply for quite a while even for a second time (for extended periods) almost always gives off the vibe of not being interested. Thus you might find that he started a discussion with someone else in the meanwhile."
GrowYourClit,fdec9v6,t1_fddfgud,1578335882.0,"Although I'm tempted to agree (with asserting that the earlier appearance of this sub would've made a bigger push for the clit enlargement movement) don't forget that a lot of people with such kink used to dwell on Tumblr before those morons did their radical policy shift, so it might not have gained momentum this fast anyway."
GrowYourClit,fdebmbb,t1_fde73vt,1578335471.0,"Yeah, that's true, although I still think that pumping one's clit will gradually make it larger (due to the stretching).

Pumping,fddffph,t1_fck4m9g,1578309852.0,Actually guys don't have it that easy either. Once you're longer than say 7.5 inches you find that tubes for your size are few and far between. Your GF will probably have to opt for a penis pump instead :P
GrowYourClit,fddezsp,t1_fddegwj,1578309249.0,"Uhm, okay. I certainly hope that it'll be found by more and more people as it gains momentum, because I think it's great that these posters are putting in real effort. Hopefully more and more women will start doing this too."

niceguys,fd1zr20,t1_fcz16hf,1578139376.0,"Yes, I know what jaded means. Jaded would it be if he wouldn't preach about knowing ""the fucking truth"". Okay, I admit that he didn't mention anything about mistreating women (although his rant kinda implies that), but the whole litany still reeks of this ""I used to be nice, but I became aggressive, only because you made me do that"" attitude, which is not quite what jaded means either.

Yes, the fact that he sounds like a 16- to 19-year-old is exactly what makes this whole thing even more pathetic. He doesn't know anything, is obviously frustrated, hasn't learned anything from his past mistakes, sounds like he's doing a revenge plot and is unwilling to learn things and improve. This is why I think that he's not gonna improve, even if he'd be given some sound advice."
niceguys,fd1y5u1,t1_fd1woor,1578138658.0,"Her lie happened BEFORE he started being pushy. Which means it hardly can be explained away by his reaction. And that means she'll probably lie to others as well. No, such lie was not justifiable at all and reassuring her will just increase her probability of running into similar nasty dating accidents. 

His reactions were just the icing on the cake, so to say."
niceguys,fd1v8iz,t1_fd1sgk5,1578137347.0,"Yes, I know that that's what she said. However her latter reply kinda implies that it was just something she made up as an excuse so that she doesn't have to go on a date with him. Even her saying that ""she wanted to to tell him in person"" kinda implies that she was just trying to delay the inevitable.

The problem is that it's not ""even if she lied"", because if she's lying to all the dates she meets then it's never gonna go further than ""2 people who met twice for an evening"". It's always a two-way street."

niceguys,fd1rchh,t1_fd1mkyr,1578135592.0,"Uh-huh. That's what a lot of girls seem to think. That lying would make it easier to say no. Except the guys usually don't get the hint, which makes the situation even more awkward and leads to exchanges like the above one (save for his last reply of course). Fortunately girls like that quite often end up being one of those ""crazy cat ladies"", so no harm's done."
