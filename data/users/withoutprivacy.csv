Rather than configure all of those individually, I just have to set my dhcp server to set pihole as every device’s dns. 

And for me, I can’t install ublock since I’m on an iPhone and iPad.  I rarely browse on my desktop. And things like smart TVs have embedded ads on their apps panel, so ublock wouldn’t fix those. But dns blocking does."

I have 7 million ad hosts blocked and most websites don’t run the way YouTube does.  Those ads do come in on their own url so dns blocking is possible."
gadgets,ffcd870,t3_esv1lu,1579796938.0,"Before anyone experiences any disappointment: this does not block YouTube ads. 

YouTube ads are served over the same URL that the actual video is served.  The only reason things like ublock work is because the advertisement is still loaded in its own html element. Browser extensions can manipulate Webpage DOM so they remove that element to bypass the ads. DNS blocking can’t alter DOM objects.

However I do still recommend using pihole. It’s a great service and it’s lightweight.  

It won’t work on YouTube but there’s plenty of websites that do serve ads through a unique url like *.adhost.com.  

I have 7 million ad hosts blocked and most of my web viewing experience is clear because of it. 

It also blocks a lot of telemetry. Windows 10 is constantly sending data to Microsoft through telemetry. For people who have unifi, I believe it’s been patched now though, they were also sending telemetry data for whatever reason. That *can* be blocked by pihole.

Like someone else mentioned on here, sometimes it’s too good and blocked a lot of stuff they didn’t want blocked. That can be avoided. Just don’t use DNS blocklists. Make your own. 

Browse the web with pihole set as your dns server, then individually block content you run into. Then rather than having to sift through millions of hosts, you just slowly have to build up your own list.

If your sole mission is YouTube ads -

On android to block YouTube ads: /r/Vanced

On iPhone: jailbreak and download YouTube++ 

On desktop: ublock origin on chrome or Firefox

 what I did was get a pi4 and installed raspian on it.  

Then I installed minidlna player and I installed hostapd on the pi.  DLNA server + it turns my pi into a hotspot that I can connect to. 

I also had a 2TB 2.5” laptop hdd lying around I wasn’t using. My library is bigger than that but 2TB of content is plenty for me and I can always swap it out. 

So my 2.5” is plugged in via the USB 3 port and I connect to my hotspot so I can directly stream from the hdd using VLC player installed on my iphone or iPad w.e I’m using at the time.  

Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but AFAIK VLC player supports more codecs than plex does right? So I use VLC to limit my transcoding. And from what I’ve read, plex runs slower on pi which is why I just Use minidlna player, a low resource service. 

The only issue I have with this is big content but that is  expected.  Larger files need more buffering of course. My copy of anchorman is 17GB and Superbad is 20GB. 

Anchorman plays but it buffers frequently, Superbad plays but for some reason it won’t play any audio. 

I could fix this by not having huge files, but it’s not a big deal to me. I just won’t watch those unless I’m at home watching plex.  Plenty of other content to choose from.

But everything else plays fine. I think the biggest file I’ve not had problems with was 7GB. Most my content is between 500mb and 4gb.



The reason I made this thing was for my office.  Work doesn’t give us WiFi access because they know we have so much down time we won’t even try to look busy anymore we’ll just watch movies. 

So without WiFi, I would burn through all my phones data plan in like an hour if I tried to stream my plex. 

So I set this up so my co workers could enjoy it too at work. I usually have 5-6 people connected and there aren’t really any issues with bandwidth. I just had to remove the big content from the drive so no one would play it and slow the rest of us down."
