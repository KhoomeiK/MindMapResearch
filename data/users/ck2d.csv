AvPD,fdhsqnz,t1_fczkqk4,1578429462.0,"You're confusing AvPD with social anxiety.  Some people with AvPD only feel okay around people they already know are safe, in other words their family, where they know the judgment will be positive.  Some people with AvPD can't even tolerate the closeness of family, and for them the only way they can be around people is if they travel far enough away that they can be sure they'll never run into anyone they'll meet again so any judgment they receive will be temporary and finite."

The best way to make it work is if when one pulls away they tell the other person what's going on and why, which isn't easy.  It helps nip the self blame a bit."

If he doesn't get removed (along with the vice president) this impeachment, he'll be impeached a second time and convicted of war crimes.  It's going to be ugly, but 3 years from now we'll have a new set of leaders in place and the war will have peaked if not ended.  You won't be drafted."

It's online somewhere, it's the most blood lust soaked thing I've ever read.  I don't know if there's more than one chapter, but it definitely fits this brief."
