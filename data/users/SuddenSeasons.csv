If someone is an adult and hasn't been seen for it they're unlikely to ever be diagnosed unless someone points them toward it, especially women. For me it only became obvious when I got married and had another person kind of observing some of my patterns.

television,fdakozp,t1_fdagf4p,1578247130.0,"There's a number of ""impossible to falsify"" theories with that case. It's very polarized and a lightning rod of a topic anywhere on the internet. I personally don't have a theory, despite being pretty into true crime, for that reason. It's done to death, every theory is out there, and nobody will ever read your theory and go, ""ah, I have changed my mind."" They're too encamped - which is fine. I've fucked up and gotten too deep into my own theories before which turned out wrong.

There's DNA!, but it's not unimpeachable DNA, which leads to two sides just screaming at each other because we can never know! That's about the worst case scenario. Give me a stone cold whodunnit like Madeline McCann there, at least then everyone is writing fanfiction. But this case ""sucks"" for discussing.

The DNA is just right to prove whatever you want it to prove. If you think intruder, bam there's DNA from ""Unidentified Male 1"" and ""No innocent explanation,"" for how it got there. If you don't believe the intruder theory there's actually around a half dozen plausible ways for the DNA to have gotten there given how trace it was and that it was the 1990s."
