Vietnamese- Chao Bistro

Shawarma- Shawarma G

Chinese - Guelph BBQ

Gastro pub- Baker St Station or Fat Duck

Indian- Spice Roots

I could go on, but those are some of my Guelph faves for sure"
thebachelor,ff4xekd,t1_ff4xbgj,1579574744.0,They must have read her recaps in preparation

dogs,feic4w8,t3_ep5jpm,1579135050.0,"Sounds like you've heard what you needed to hear. I just wanted to say I am so so sorry. Best of luck to you tomorrow. Although it's painful, they do say that dogs look for their owner in their final moments, so try to be beside her if you can. I'm so sorry. I'm tearing up just writing this. Although it seems too soon, in her mind, I'm sure she has lived a full and happy life. Please try not to feel bad about your decision. I think it's the best thing for her. It's just so painful for us. I don't know you, but I'll be thinking of you. Good luck. :)"

thebachelor,fckd9qz,t1_fciyllg,1577722740.0,"Ya, what ended it for me was Chris soules' interview. Ashley asked him a question and proceeded to ramble and try to answer the question herself before Chris could even speak. And Ben has 5 minute preambles before all of his questions. They're so concerned with being liked that they dance around their opinions. And yes, the ads!!"
thebachelor,fcivpio,t3_eh1x5j,1577670947.0,Not an unfollow exactly but I just unsubscribed from Ben and Ashley's podcast. I thought it used to be ok but I can't deal anymore
