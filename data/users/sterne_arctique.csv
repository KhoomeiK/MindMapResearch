relationship_advice,fenyu9a,t3_eq0884,1579292803.0,"Ok let me tell you something that happened tomy husband and I last year.

I started having thoughts about taking my own life, went to the doctor, diagnosed depression and anxiety. I’m put off work for 6 months and I am miserable. PTSD from rape that happened 15 years ago that I thought I was over with, I panick at the thought of leaving the bed to do anything.

2 weeks after, hubby is diagnosed with Crown desease. He is basically shitting himself out, got no energy at all, suffers greatly and has to go through a really painful process to discover which foods he can or can’t eat. We are scared he might have colon cancer. 

Guess what. We still had the ability to care for each other. We both respected and understood when the pther just couldn’t, but also went great lenght to help in any way possible. Making the other laugh, small attentions, fighting for the other’s situation to improve. We both care about each other so, so much that even through absolute hell we support each other. 

I am not saying your man is a bad man! 

I’m just saying that the relationship I have now is the only one I’d have. What’s the point of settling down with someone who can’t even do that. I’d be far better alone than with someone who’s dragging me down when I have just suffered the worst possible thing that can ever happen to me."

Don’t you go compare taking care of bees and collecting their honey as abuse! Beekeepers are the first and loudest fighters against Pesticides that kill bees. Without them there wouldn’t be nearly as much research around the dying bees problem, they really do everything they can to keep them alive. 

The meat INDUSTRY treats animals worse than objects, but damn, you can’t compare that to beekeeping. People like you, who are just reactive, without thinking, are the reason so many people hate veganism."

I’m glad he was there. Thanks again!"

My lil sis came out to me years ago and thanked me for always being so open about my sexuality. She said that it really helped her accepting hers 😊. It was so touching.

But then when my little BROTHER came out as bi as well I was over the moon. We all know the prejudices men go through for liking men, and knowing my very anxious little brother, it impressed me so much...

Now to see them both, young, open, fabulous people accepting themselves and being accepted as they are in the world is so beautiful, so wholesome, I live for these feelings. I’m so happy and proud...

I’m glad you have that too."
ladyladyboners,fdh5boj,t3_el8cgb,1578415706.0,I’m so happy she exists.

I used to date Maru first. That girl was great too. A bit young, I admit, but this girl is smart as hell and has great personnality.

I mean yeah Abi is rude at first, Penny is shy, but that is normal behavior, I find. Overly dramatic Elliot is such a turn off... Alex really ONLY talks about his body, and tells you you won’t play catch because you are a girl 🙄 and then Shane... poor Shane, he is nice and all, a great friend, but having babies with him seems perillious."
StardewValley,fdfcfct,t3_ekzqex,1578358404.0,"All of them are so much more interesting than the bachelors! 😕 I mean I really don’t mind being gay, it’s absolutely great, but I’d also like to marry a man in one of my saves... a man that maybe isn’t absolutely fond of himself, a social wreck, an alcoholic or an old dude with a mustache who feels he ruined his life... 

Rant over."
StardewValley,fdfc4g4,t1_fdf81y9,1578358199.0,"I’m dying when my character pulls out a god dammed HARP. Like look at me, working from 6 to midnight, chopping trees down, gardening, building, being the coolest person in town, offering so much of my hard work FOR FREE, now on my way to the mines where I break endless rocks and kill ferocious beasts, but oh! Why not push a lil note on a HARP."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fde1nge,t3_ekl6my,1578329159.0,"You bet. I’ve had many single years when I protected my precious freedom like a wolf. I still got horny but no men I was with ever interested me in the least for a relationship and I was always extremely honest about it. I worked in multiple provinces in Canada and travelled to multiple countries when not working. After each time we slept together or when they asked me to stay until morning, whenever really, I told them I did not love them and never would. I was a mean bitch. I didn’t enjoy it, I just wanted to make sure there wouldn’t be any drama, any heart break when I decided to leave. I wanted things to be clear and they always played it cool and went along.

Well you guessed, every fuckin time I left, I was called a whore, a liar, every slurs under the sun, there were tears and shouts. What the hell? I had been more than clear and they always agreed with my terms before.   
More than once I was told “But I thought it was just a facade, I thought you’d fall in love with me. Girls usually fall in love with me”.   
I was at loss as to where these fantasies came from. You post makes so much sense!"

StardewValley,fdazugx,t1_fdasu2f,1578252177.0,"The moment he talks to us in the bar and says “I’m a nice guy if you get to know me I swear” killed it for me. From that moment I made a point to rummage through trash before him and giving him the trash I got out of it whenever I could. 
Nice guy my ass, all he does is complain about the life he chose and can’t even treat Emily like a human being."
