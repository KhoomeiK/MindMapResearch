Also, the idea of a society ruled by the people, or rather the community, instead of a state appealed to me.

worldbuilding,ffrwjik,t3_euniq3,1580167478.0,"I’m actually doing a similar thing in my setting.

The main reason for colonization is resources. In fact, that’s mostly what the reasons boiled down to. The White Man’s Burden, as others have mentioned, is really just a flimsy justification to colonize, which is all the European powers needed. 

A couple other justifications: If there are natives with a different religion, could it be possible the colonizers want to “convert them.” It could basically be a space crusade. Even better, the colonizers could use that reason as a reason to colonize so as to not make it obvious that the reason was resources.

You could also have the colonizers accuse the colonized nation of attacking the colonizers. That would make the colonizers angry enough that they’d be totally fine with conquering said attackers. I believe Japan May or May not have done this when conquering Manchuria.

In your case, since it’s in space resources are probably going to be a big reason to colonize. From that point, just make up excuses to colonize like the original European powers did."

worldbuilding,ffrvrl2,t1_ffqr2ho,1580166958.0,"These are good points. I was going to bring up the White Man’s Burden kind of deal. OP can still use the justification of “These places are uncivilized, so we must conquer them to civilize them.” The colonizers could even spread false claims about the history of the conquered civilization, similar to how European power tried to make it seem like African History was all about savage, uncivilized tribes. They even saw stone structures in the southern portions of Africa (I believe in around Zimbabwe), and assumed the Arabians built those when in reality the local Africans built those."
worldbuilding,ffrv9zk,t3_euu53w,1580166630.0,"Well, in the Lunar Kingdom (I’ve yet to give it a name. I just hate that I can’t call it “The Moonrise Kingdom”), people who are high class often wear clothes inspired by the clothes of the Ryukyu kingdom. 

Meanwhile, in Astria, most everyone wears regular clothes and people rarely dress up at all. They don’t even dress up in fancy clothes for work. The only times they do are during political meetings, weddings, funerals, and other special occasions. Militia members, however, wear jumpsuits similar to what airmen wear. They often have red and black patches on them.

The nation of Libertarians (I can’t come up with a name for this place either) wear steampunk inspired clothes. They range from fancy Victorian suits to worker uniforms.

So far these are my ideas for my world’s fashion. To be honest though, I know barely anything about fashion. Can anyone show me resources to learn about it?"

GovernmentBuilding,ffiap06,t1_ffi8l51,1579969362.0,"I’m not quite sure what you mean by cultural context.

As for culture, it is made up of people from around the world, from The Middle East to Asia to America. 

I anticipate you might be wondering , “But won’t there be cultural conflicts Because of this?” My answer to that is there are cultural measures to prevent that. For one, many of these people have shared reasons to be in Astria. Many are here because they were stateless or refugees, many were coming for better economic lives, and many others were simply joining because they wanted to be a part of advancing human civilization. Furthermore, the collective government makes sure encourage the people to befriend each other and let go of past grudges or resentment.

GovernmentBuilding,ffgvf3f,t1_ffgi8x1,1579916052.0,"These are good questions. I have not thought about them before. I will consider them when making my adjustments. 

You made a good point about the Oligarchy. I did indeed forget to list the number of unions represented. I haven’t figured out how many unions there will be, but I know there will be a lot of unions. There will be unions for the military, for healthcare, for housing, and for many other industries and social aspects. 

I haven’t thought about districts yet. I definitely will try to implement them as they will make the government even more decentralized. I did neglect to mention that this is actually the government of a space colony. Sorry for not mentioning that. It will be located on the Arcadian Region of Mars. I do suppose I could make districts though.

I do think local laws would be decided from a large council of that district. Many laws would only be decided at the local level. The Representative Council would not meet except when discussing national laws, foreign policy, and military action. I would imagine those meetings would be few. 

You bring up a good point about corporations having power over the government. I do think there should be at least a little balance. However, I almost feel as if the Union-led corporations are supposed to have a power over the Representative council. After all, the worker unions own the means of production, not the government. However, I do suppose the government could rely on other sources of income. What sources would you suggest?
