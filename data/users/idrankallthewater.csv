BreakUps,ffutvv9,t1_ffup8p8,1580249249.0,My ex told me to not worry about someone that I was suspicious of. Turns out she starts dating a few weeks after breaking up with me. It sucks but it’s out of my control and the only the I can do it focus on myself and improve my life.
BreakUps,ffpl1rr,t3_euidvz,1580097658.0,I know how you feel. It sucks so much. Mine treated me like a stranger and that hurts a lot. She’s not the same person anymore
BreakUps,ffkbi3t,t3_eu2fur,1580020062.0,There is a big difference between 18 and 23. Totally different mindsets and maturity. I guarantee that your ex is just in it for the money. But you have to let her do her own thing. Respect her decision. Focus on yourself and reflect on your feelings. Ask yourself why you feel like that and what initiatives you can take to make yourself feel better about it. You got this.
BreakUps,ffjtb8l,t3_etvjd9,1580006370.0,You’re overthinking. Everyone has ran into their exes in one way or another. Yes she may have saw you but she probably didn’t think much of it. I can guarantee that. Don’t worry about it. And don’t worry about what she thinks. You need to start focusing on yourself. Be confident and you won’t have to worry what others think. You got this.
BreakUps,ffjt1wv,t1_ffj1j5f,1580006173.0,"This is the answer. We continue to keep growing and learning no matter what. After the break up, we shouldn’t focus our energy on our ex’s. We need to focus on ourselves and ask ourselves what do we want out of our lives."
BreakUps,ffjssw6,t3_etx65l,1580005979.0,You’re having the right mindset and doing the right things. You got this
BreakUps,ffjsm83,t3_etyu7g,1580005839.0,I feel you. After my ex left me there was no one there for me. I had no friends. Family was too busy with work. All I had was a couple subreddits and strangers advice. It helped but sometimes I wish there was someone I could lean on. Or maybe I have to lean on myself and be strong to figure it out.
BreakUps,ffjshh9,t3_etzm8h,1580005736.0,Initially I thought I was but then I realized that we both had problems.
BreakUps,ffgpw22,t1_fffzlyq,1579912044.0,You are right. All we have is to learn from what we experienced. Everything else besides that like the drama after a break up is noise and does not matter. We should focus on ourselves to continue to move forward.
ExNoContact,ffgpair,t3_etiaxv,1579911623.0,"Continue to do NC. Do not reach out. If he wanted to be with you, he wouldn’t stop at one text. He would have to clearly state it otherwise it’s all breadcrumbs to relieve his guilt."
ExNoContact,ffe1aug,t3_et2ef7,1579834120.0,Don’t worry about it. What’s done is done. Fixating on something that’s not that big of a deal with bring you more stress. You got this.
ExNoContact,ffe0u3b,t3_et4024,1579833780.0,My ex and I had a plushie dumbo the elephant. So I get sad whenever I see anything related to elephants. Letting go is hard but it’s what must be done in order for us to move on.
BreakUps,ffdzq5d,t3_et3nxk,1579832977.0,I’m sorry you’re hurting. First loves are tough to get over. You’ll find love again in the future. They will outshine her. Meanwhile you should focus on yourself and rebuild your life. Find new hobbies to fill the void. Surround yourself with family and friends. You got this
ExNoContact,ffdxdu7,t3_et0l5o,1579831290.0,I’m so sorry you feel like that. It’s because you still have a strong connection with your ex. It’ll take time for it to fade away. You have to decide if you still want to be in a relationship with this other guy. Would it be fair to him if you’re still thinking about your ex?
BreakUps,ffbfeuo,t3_esp76g,1579762918.0,"There’s nothing wrong with you. It’s proof that you loved deeply. Sometimes things just don’t work out between two people. There’s nothing wrong with that. If you love her, then you’ll let her be. If things are meant to be then she’ll come back. But focus on yourself and find your passion. Find what makes you happy. What drives to get out of bed every morning. Live for yourself and love yourself. It’ll get easier. It’s okay to miss them but accept what has happened and let go. You have so many opportunities ahead of you."
BreakUps,ffaymol,t1_ffayhdw,1579747518.0,Thank you my friend
BreakUps,ffavsnk,t3_eslzlt,1579745644.0,very insensitive post
ExNoContact,ff8fdf8,t3_es7wsi,1579676075.0,I don’t think mine will ever contact me again and I’m okay with it. Sure I miss her but I’ll be alright. I have a bright future ahead of me filled with opportunities. It’s the time to grow and embrace who I am.
BreakUps,ff6vsyt,t1_ff6mpa7,1579635909.0,Thanks man. Just taking it one day at a time
BreakUps,ff57gnj,t3_erpowe,1579582448.0,I’m so sorry OP. My ex and I only dated for 9 months and I feel like I shouldn’t be making a big deal about it. It wasn’t that long but somehow I feel so crushed by it. When I see others with their longer relationships I felt like it can just end any second. I’m afraid of being committed for someone for so long only for them to leave. It’s scary to me. I know that I have to trust and not be afraid. That only holds you back. I’m still working on trusting people and learning to love myself. I hope things will be better for you. Life throws us crazy things but there’s always good. I wish you the best of luck.
ExNoContact,ff57819,t3_ern1wu,1579582239.0,"I know how you feel. It’s the hardest thing in the world. But remember that you’ll always have yourself. You will never leave yourself. Love yourself and take things a day at a time. It’s never easy and you may think about them everyday but that’s okay. Keep yourself open to the world. Learn new things, cultures, and meet new people. Go travel. It will all be okay my friend."
ExNoContact,ff56wyx,t3_ernixq,1579581975.0,"My ex and I use to say goodnight to each other over text before we went to bed. Sometimes one of us would have a nightmare and we would text each other. One of us would wake up and comfort the other. It’s been 6-7 months now and it does get easier. I mainly just miss the small things we shared. Those intimate moments that nothing in the world can replace. Loving someone is a beautiful thing and when you have the chance to have it, cherish it. Even if they aren’t with you anymore just know that you had the opportunity to experience real life that so many people want to find. I wish you the best of luck OP."
