Nepal,fepqgs0,t1_fepppfa,1579327861.0,"I am focused on a single element of the movie, and the genre also depends on people to people. For me, a psychological thriller is a movie where antagonists do the crime without mercy (it should have dramas more not a gore type)or protagonist has a problem with a self, his present and act against the society and the plot is fully based on his viewing of the word, his mind and his dilemma, his detachment from the reality. The movie is a psychological thriller if the cornerstone of the movie is based on antagonist/protagonist behavior. I don't find that on handmaiden. Just google what psychological thriller means!"

The character can see others but the antagonist cant sees them. but I liked the building, and colors  used in the movie. but the point is movie is full of assumptions. There is no place in movies where I've felt I am watching a thriller movie. The movie is a mystery but flows like a water, and the tension it creates is more like childish(maybe because it was created way back in time ). and handmaiden is not a psychological thriller lol. It is mystery. The antagonist or protagonist do not possess a psycho like behavior nor the plot is focused towards it."
