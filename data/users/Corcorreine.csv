fatlogic,feypbwn,t3_eqhfl0,1579448613.0,"Does anybody have some good blogs with vegetarian/vegan low calorie recipes?
I let everything hang for a bit, and i want to get back on track but i fins it really hard to look for recipes when i have absolutely no idea what to cook.
Other than that, my sportsbra broke friday, during a gymsession which was a real bummer, but i got a newer and better model now, and even did a small walk/run session to test it out."
belgium,fegk65k,t1_fegiqs8,1579095228.0,"Sent an(envelope) package to a friend within eu. Not that big and not that heavy, but i think it still cost like 25 euros and arrived in a shitty state regardless."
belgium,fegdzgw,t1_fedm1dh,1579089384.0,Was already expensive now its even worse? PostNL it is.
nottheonion,fdjd7ah,t1_fdj9mbi,1578466000.0,"Tuxes are expensive because they are often made form high grade materials, (better quality than what youd find in higher priced stores) and are either custom made from scratch or at least fitted."
fatlogic,fd5dc0o,t1_fd59ey3,1578176499.0,"I dont really get the point you want to make.
Soy and corn are not for direct human consumption, but for animal feed. Food grown for direct human consumption is a minority (i think about 25 percent but id have to look it up) because our diet is overloaded with animal products.Palm oil, the way it is being farmed now is an ecological tragedy, but its avoidable in food, even when eating vegan."
worldnews,fcpm1ez,t1_fcpk1e5,1577867241.0,"Not always. Probably analyses your search history, that of people like you and people around you to figure out what you are most likely to look for.
As a european i would like forest in winter to put on a christmas card. A australian would have more use of forest fires to get updates. Google thinks it would be bullshit to give us the same results. Plus SEO is a real thing."
fatlogic,fcjq1hu,t1_fcj02p6,1577698860.0,"Ignore them, its a seven days old account with two inflammatory posts and a lot of bullshit comments, its a troll."
fatlogic,fc6obiy,t1_fc4xa0o,1577485366.0,"Shit, i am technically catholic, meet me  at the parking lot, lets settle this for once and for all!

Those are some good rules though, no buying your way into heaven with premium seats, just give  because you want to be kind to others."
fatlogic,fc4x76l,t1_fc3qq1k,1577432235.0,"This comment really annoys the crap out of me (but this is not an attack on you), because where i live, the roman catholic church owns a shitton of money and hoards it like a dragon hoards gold. Then they sell you guilt for not living in sobriety and spending your extra income on poor starving children. How dare you :c.

Edit:owns instead if owes"
fatlogic,fb8qaqk,t1_fb8l29n,1576619415.0,"Act like though shit, but delete their comments after one call out.

Weak."
