I’m lucky and very rarely get outbreaks like you’ll see on wiki.


Edit: “ Hailey-Hailey disease is caused by a genetic change (mutation) in the ATP2C1 gene. The ATP2C1 gene contains instructions for creating (encoding) a protein that acts as a calcium and magnesium pump in the cells”

Hmm wonder if it does make it worde"
Iowa,ffdtn90,t1_ffdt41u,1579828638.0,"My mom has something genetic that mad her teeth go to shit when she was in her 20’s, maybe I have the same thing? I dunno. I also have a genetic skin disease that weakens my nails and skin, I wonder if that had an effect on speeding up their decay.  Basically i had been dealt a bad hand and piled not ever behind a habitual brusher on top of it.

 My wisdom teeth fell out within a month of coming out.  Would literally just be brushing my teeth and spitting chunks of them out, zero pain whatsoever.  I had almost perfect teeth too as far as alignment went.  If there’s one thing I could change it’d be that.

It’s super embarrassing for me though because I have meetings in my job with people I want to impress. (Costco board members, ceos etc)"
Iowa,ffdsyy8,t1_ffdrmri,1579828153.0,"Mason city, in the area semi-often for work.  But yeah dude, my teeth are bad.  Grew up with parents who both had dentures so they never really grew up with the habit instilled in me.  Even now that I’m adult and do it a lot, I have to remind myself after a few days because it’s just never been in my routine.

I water pik the shit out of them though."

Current town is you can have no cardboard or paper bigger then 8x10. So you have to cut down cereal boxes and shit.  If a milk jug has a ring on it they leave everything.  Just keep going right on by."
