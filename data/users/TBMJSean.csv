This is coming from someone who desperately wants the removal of 2a, but i dont see that happening with any of the candidates in the presidential race.

The GOP uses fear tactics to make honest people such as yourself believe  people like bernie sanders will take away all your gun rights. This is not the case. Senator Sanders does want to bring the topic up to debate on what can be done to reduce the amount of gun violence that doesnt impede your rights.

Dont be faked out by this single issue, our most pressing issue, and the one that will still be an issue a century from now, wont be abortion, 2a, m4a, or lgbtq rights... Its climate change"
