I have shifted my whole life so many times, I don't have a culture or group I can belong to (I even speak 4 languages). I'm not a 10 looks wise but I'm not a 4 either. I eat healthy, excersize regularly, play 3 instruments. I watch tv, read, game, play sports and if the occasion calls for it, I drink, smoke (weed sometimes) and even dance (like a waving tube guy). I wank the usual 3-4 times a week. I sleep an irregular 7 hrs and drive to work (cycling will resume after winter). I am not funny but I know I'm not absolutely boring either. Last relationship (out of the 2 serious ones I was in) lasted 3 years but that was 3 years ago. I haven't had the luck of meeting anyone since. I work on personal projects but I need others like me to fully put those projects in action. I am not depressed but I've felt down for months now. My guess is lack of successful social interaction and it is a feedback loop that's growing. I try to be happy just for happiness's sake so I can keep my mind healthy but it feels fake. I can feel the sadness taking a toll on my mind as it is getting slower and heavier. I continue smiling anyway. People may or may not have noticed. I'd rather not bother them with my personal issues.

I am content but not happy.
