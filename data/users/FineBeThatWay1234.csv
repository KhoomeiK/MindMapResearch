Congratulations on your weight loss!"

offmychest,fdqmg90,t1_fdq4b27,1578670148.0,"Absolutely. People don’t kill themselves for nothing. Either the parents aren’t as nice as people think, or there was unknown bullying - I certainly don’t know. But assuming that her life was perfect and she had no reason to kill herself seems very wrong to me."
progresspics,fcwfdy4,t3_ej2dpf,1578024211.0,Great work!
offmychest,fcl9c1z,t1_fcl1il7,1577742624.0,You’re welcome! This post is really making my day as well! The positive response definitely boosts my confidence to continue doing things like this for myself :)
offmychest,fcl8j72,t1_fcl8ft6,1577742121.0,Please do!
offmychest,fcl8hpe,t1_fcl4f18,1577742094.0,"I played on my phone and occasionally smiled at people, that’s about it.

The host at the restaurant didn’t quite believe me when I said I wanted a table for one.  Once she prepared the table, she asked me again if it’s “still for one.” Yes ma’am it is. Thanks for asking!

It’s incredibly awkward. But worth it.  I’m assuming it gets less awkward over time?  Idk, I’m being hopeful."
offmychest,fckk4cr,t1_fckg4yq,1577727076.0,That sounds awesome!
offmychest,fck5u7t,t1_fck3yw0,1577717438.0,"It helped that my friends encouraged me. I nearly bailed on dinner, because solo dinners are awkward for me. But my friend told me I’d be awesome for doing it, so I did it.

Yay support system!"
offmychest,fck5q6q,t1_fck01e7,1577717349.0,"I did all the things one would normally do for a date, but just for myself. Normal me does not wear makeup, do my hair, or wear dresses or heels on a regular basis. If I’m eating out, my normal meal would be chipotle, not a fancy steak dinner.

I treated myself nicely without the motivation of impressing a date."
offmychest,fcjxd64,t1_fcjwrc0,1577709188.0,"Yes, I agree. I learned this through my attempts at dating. I really don’t want to hurt people. So I’m trying something different :)"
offmychest,fcjxb36,t1_fcjqxs8,1577709115.0,Do it!
offmychest,fcjx9bc,t1_fcjdqf0,1577709054.0,Thanks!
offmychest,fcjx8hr,t1_fcjfjfi,1577709026.0,"My plan is to spend the next 3 months just dating myself. After that, I’ll reevaluate."
offmychest,fcja2td,t3_ehgyx6,1577681051.0,"1) be honest. Hopefully your boyfriend is understanding. 2) some things to try: request that y’all shower right before, or even have sex in the shower. That should reduce the smell. And wear a condom - that will reduce the mess. You can buy flavored condoms so that you can give oral easier. Find something that does put you in the mood solo, and bring that into the relationship. Maybe it’s music, a favorite toy, perfume/cologne, etc. Be honest about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it so that you don’t get weird questions about it in the moment. 3) you’re not alone."
