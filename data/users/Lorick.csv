It may have been as small as not going to a doctor when he felt funny. it may have been getting in his car black out drunk five minutes before this video. I don't know the decision, no. But there was one made at some point in that drivers past that led to this outcome.

Edit: Mostly I am sharing my own realization that no matter how small or insignificant my decisions are, they affect EVERYTHING. And could end up with me being behind that wheel."
