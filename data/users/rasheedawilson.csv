Antidepressants have a very structured dosage plan. You can't take them one day and not the next. And you can't just switch antidepressants like that. You are either describing a medicine that isn't antidepressants or your friend saw a very incompetent doctor.

I have BPII and been on all kinds of psych meds. I'm frankly a little confused."
BoJackHorseman,ffjhakx,t3_ety5kx,1579998214.0,"Antidepressants are not addictive lol. The problem with long-term antidepressant usage is that they stop becoming effective and you keep needing higher dosages and that isn't great for your liver etc. Unless you're really Bipolar and antidepressants trigger mania for you there is no extra buzz to get from them. I believe it's actually hard to get people stay on antidepressants more than anything because the experience of taking them is unpleasant. Btw, withdrawal symptoms is not the same as addiction."
EDAnonymous,ffhkr8w,t1_fffgdsj,1579939848.0,"Yeah according to those celeb sites everyone has hourglass measurements lol.

It's just having an hourglass shape with decent ass pretty much."
EDAnonymous,ffhkk8x,t3_etnxsa,1579939565.0,"It's hard to say because it really all depends how comfortable Taylor Swift feels divulging all that stuff. It may be a lot for her to even admit having the ED at all.

Taylor benefits a lot from being thin especially in her 00 days. Yes, the fashion world would have loved her. But I wouldn't say her body was on trend. The thicker hourglass body has been on trend for a while and she was shamed for having a flat arse and no boobs. She was praised for having long legs etc. And she is still conventionally attractive but she wasn't exactly seen as #bodygoals. I think 15 years ago she would have been but Kim Kardashian changed all that. If you don't have a decent ass these days. I don't think you quite make it on the top hot bod list.

Looking back to her 1989 days....I think she would have qualified as having anorexia based on her BMI alone. We don't know if she had professional help and recovered through treatment.

She is still thin now though and I don't think anyone considers her thicc. She still has a ruler shaped body with little curves. She is just healthier."

EDAnonymous,ffejrby,t3_et59e3,1579850894.0,"A lot of the measurements posted online about models and actresses are usually wrong. I honestly think they are way too forgiving.

I wouldn't even worry about it because traditional modelling is becoming less and less popular. People are much preferring the 'slim thicc' look."
Instagramreality,ffejacq,t3_et6ppd,1579850317.0,Are some these instagram models really porn stars?
theofficememes,ffej7dt,t3_et6uph,1579850215.0,I think he has conventionally attractive features and it will depend on your taste. I think he is hot. But I think the gag is the standards aren't high.
fatlogic,ffbzmte,t1_ffbxtot,1579787709.0,It's muscle. Having more muscle makes it easier to lose weight.
fatlogic,ffbzc6r,t1_ffbvzov,1579787480.0,East Asians have much smaller frames. More so that they have very narrow hips and thin legs. They are not just thin but also narrower if that makes sense. I just don't buy Asian clothing.  They wouldn't be very flattering as they suit more ruler shaped bodies.
fatlogic,ffbh3cg,t3_esos5i,1579765002.0,"Here is the thing:

Not all exercises are meant for everyone. Running/jogging should only be done by people who have the appropriate shoes and are willing to ensure they run with proper form. You really don't have to take up running lol. I've had a full leg dislocation and a knee dislocation when I was 14 and 15, only to find out that I have genetically shit knees. I can still run and do physical activity but I do choose to do more low impact stuff. Body weight/ resistance moves are great. Planks, burpees mountain climbers etc. Are fucking amazing and do wonders to tone your body and are relatively low impact. (For some reason my knees don't mind jumping or skipping rope but it's not too big on running). Pilates and yoga is also low impact. I like doing HIIT for cardio as well.

Exercise isn't suppose to be painful. If it is then you are doing it in wrong form and if you struggle to keep proper form then move into something else.

Exercise is also for physical health. I don't understand why it is problematic to say that lol"
fatlogic,ff8ghwt,t1_ff8gf1m,1579677431.0,"Plus, I don't think I've ever seen a drug addict with a serious drug problem who look great. They all look pretty terrible and definitely not healthy lol."
fatlogic,ff8gf1m,t3_es7bqq,1579677332.0,"I'm not really fond of these generalisations because I can't imagine knowing everything a person eats or how much exercise they do. People are also so unreliable when it comes to reporting their eating or exercise  habits. Unless they have some thyroid issues, they are eating way less and exercising far more than they let on. They might be also a harsher critic about how healthy or unhealthy they eat.  

I also think unreasonable food portions and bad food choices are just as bad as each other. Medical science has proved this. Pointing the finger at the other doesn't change the fact that they are both bad."
Instagramreality,ff2xb9o,t3_erd91p,1579527580.0,You should never get handsy with an animal you don't know. It's not the dog's fault. He is only defending himself against a stranger who is harrassing him.
