photoclass2020,fei1m6m,t1_fei0dbx,1579128303.0,"I had a chance to try the William Optics Zenithstar 61mm with my Canon, and it was pretty simple to use. Basically worked like a telephoto lens did, but much lighter weight so my tracking motor wasn't struggling. The only downside was that the Zenithstar doesn't have a built in Field flattener, so the stars were heavily skewed along the edges. 
I just ordered the Redcat 51, which has a built in flattener, so I'm really excited about that one.  

I think the dedicated camera is good advice, and probably what I'll end up doing. The ""crafty"" side of me really wants to try astromodding my dslr myself though- although that's risky and I'm likely to break it in the process. If I did go full frame (or ZWO for that matter) I could continue to use all of my existing gear and telescope. That won't change, which is why I'm purchasing those items first while I make up my mind. BUT the plunge is happening ready or not. I should have my Redcat in a few weeks. Woo!"
photoclass2020,fehzqth,t1_fehz5ec,1579127174.0,"It's a little bit if wavering on what I want. Do I want a full frame DSLR or do I want a dedicated astro camera (the ZWO)? What's stopping me now is that I'm purchasing telescopes and telephoto lenses because that is my current limiting factor, however fairly soon the crop factor will begin causing issues and forcing me to make more mosaics. Newer cameras also create less random noise, so that's another reason to upgrade soon"
photoclass2020,fehyj8t,t3_ep8wya,1579126447.0,"My camera is a DSLR, Canon T6i. I bought it used at a pawn shop, preferring to focus on expensive lenses rather than the expensive body to start out. It is unmodified, contains a bayer filter and an IR filter (standard), and has an  APS-C sensor with a 1.6x crop factor.   


My current camera works for now, but it is not the best set up. Because my preferred field of photography is astro imaging, a full-frame camera will make a huge improvement in the quality of the images. I also want a set up without a bayer or an IR filter so I can do narrowband imaging. I could perform an astro-modification on the camera to remove the bayer filter and replace the IR filter with a glass plate to allow for monochrome imaging. I would also like an air-cooled camera to prevent hot pixels and random noise during long exposures. My ideal DSLR is the Canon Ra or the ZWO ASI120MM s, an exotic type camera specially designed for astrophotography.   


To change systems will require a lot of new gear. I'll need a filter wheel and filters, including RGB, IR, UV, Ha, Sii, and Oiii. If I go with the ZWO I'll need image capture software, tether links, batteries.. oh boy, this list is already getting long. I already have the tracking motor that I'll need to start with, but I would prefer to upgrade that system as well.   


I also realize that these upgrades will make the camera nearly useless for any daylight photography, so in this case I would hold on to my (unmodified) T6i just for that"

spaceporn,feeqkje,t1_feepz78,1579039106.0,"It's a very common misunderstanding because in ordinary ""daylight"" photography, true color is what the eye sees. In low light the eye sees much better in hues of red, so greens, blues, and yellows look more muted. This is even more pronounced without an atmosphere to distort the colors further. Camera sensors, especially push-broom style, can often pick up subtle colors that the eye wouldn't immediately see (while also missing some of the structure detail!). That's why, as far as astronomy goes, true color is any image produced with RGB filters that correspond to RGB wavelengths."

This is actually a misunderstanding of the term ""true color"" and how the push-broom style camera collects data. ""True color"" colloquially means what the eye sees, but our eyes are really bad at seeing color in low light environments. True color in astronomy is using RGB filters that align with RGB wavelengths of light. So, in this case, the ""enhancement"" of the features, (the contrast, shadows, and saturation increased to show more detail in post-processing) is still true color palette."

Right about at the 10-minute mark, I found a run-down truck stop from that looks like it's been abandoned for years. I tried to focus on some of the decay and blight. I shot in RAW format so I had to make some WB adjustments in post, but no major alterations were made besides that. Shot with a Canon T6 and a Rokinon 35mm lens."
telescopes,fd3ng74,t1_fd3jeuc,1578159981.0,"This doesn't look like a single 8-minute exposure but rather a stack of images equaling 8 minutes of total integration. The core of Orion Nebula is very bright and it would be totally blown out at 8 minutes. Even 1 minute is too much for the core. 

But, to answer your question more directly, couple things can help the background sky-
Move away from light pollution, use narrowband filters, or both. And finally, it's okay if the background is bright straight out of the camera, sometimes that's even desirable so long as you don't clip any whites. You can always mask the foreground and adjust the background exposure in post. That's a useful technique to get more detail out of the nebulae (called Exposing to the Right [of the histogram])"
