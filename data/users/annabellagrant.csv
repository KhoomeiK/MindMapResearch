cats,ff4n154,t3_ere8ga,1579567576.0,When my apartment burnt down i had no pets. And it was so hard. I was living in a foreign country and i barely had any friends yet. And suddenly everything was gone except my passport laptop and my winter coat. I know how hard it is to lose your home. And i feel for you.

SkincareAddiction,felt16b,t3_eps4gl,1579230213.0,"I‚Äôm all over creating less waste wherever I can. BUT. I think it‚Äôs important to look at the places in your life where you produce the MOST waste. At the end of the day, cosmetics is a tiny fraction of the waste you produce. 
While limiting your waste in cosmetics is a great step, it‚Äôs also key to recognize what it takes to create what is IN the product. Reducing reusing and recycling is GOOD. But what about the sustainability of what is in those bottles?
And more importantly, considering that beauty products are a long time rather than instant use item, what are the things you throw away every day that you can begin to limit? 
THAT is how I became low waste. I looked at the area of my life where i produced the most trash and wasted the most water etc. At the end of the day, that‚Äôs all any of us can do."

antiMLM,fe6a2ah,t3_enqpge,1578885166.0,The thing that pisses me off about Mary Kay and Avon is that aside from being pyramid schemes they‚Äôre not even INCLUSIVE pyramid schemes. Their brads are not POC friendly. But maybe that‚Äôs a win for people of color?
