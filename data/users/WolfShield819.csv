Bone,ffho3k9,t3_etkkb9,1579944811.0,"I really enjoyed that part of the story. Reading it as a kid, it reminded me so much of the crush I had on a girl at my school. It would make me so happy to see it go somewhere, but realistically, she's a human, and he's, well, something else, and they don't seem too compatible physically... I'm sure it was for the best that his feelings went unsaid. 

But if she just gave him a lil kiss on the nose or something it would make the child in me so so happy"

Are there any theories or speculation about why it is observed in the slit that it goes to, as opposed to the other slit?

I mean, with a dice roll, we can calculate exactly what combination of physical interactions the cube has with the hand it's tossed from, the air it falls through, the table it collides with, etc., which add up to the number it lands on. So technically, given the mechanisms involved and the values of the variables which affect the die, there was a 100% chance it would land on the side it landed on.

Is it possible there are similar/analogous variables with electrons that determine where it is when it is measured, which we have yet to discover? (or can never discover but exist nonetheless)"
explainlikeimfive,ff782u1,t1_ff6fnrk,1579642963.0,"Could you explain how the math definitively tells us no?

With the guitar string analogy, it does sound like there is a definite location of the energy at any given time - maybe depending on how you define ""energy"". There's at least bounds to it - there's places it's definitely not, so there must be some boundary we can point to and say, this cloud *is* the electron, and the exact location of the boundaries of the cloud define it's location. Am I way off?"
explainlikeimfive,ff76w3k,t1_ff5s91l,1579642300.0,"So about that first part:

>The electron could be literally anywhere in the universe.

Does that mean it *is* somewhere, definitely? We don't know, we can't know, but fundamentally, it *has* a location, at any given time?

I'm so confusedddd"

TrueOffMyChest,fej2pg8,t1_fej0rdj,1579154681.0,"This is his post, so it's him I'm directing the sympathy towards. If it was his cousin's post I would direct it towards her. I agree, she absolutely deserves thought and sympathy. 

I know that he's the one doing the violating, and his cousin is the one being violated. I understand that. It's just... in my experience, it takes there being a lot of pain, rejection, self loathing, depression, etc., for a person to get to that point. And if I were to wager a bet, I'd say that OP is in greater pain on a day to day basis from loneliness and guilt than his cousin ever was from seeing those drawings. Not to minimize her pain, but just saying, I know how awful it can be to feel like no one wants you, to be so starved for positive attention and affection that you latch on to the familial love that a cousin gives in an unhealthy way. 

I think if OP is ever gonna find the strength to work on becoming a healthier person, it's gonna be from people being kind, sympathetic, and understanding towards him. He already knows what he did was wrong, now he just needs to see a way out. I hope by showing compassion he might realize that there are people out there who will accept him and help him through whatever he is going through.

I don't know for certain that OP did what he did out of loneliness and depression, but I figured it was most likely, based on personal experience. 'Tis all I have to speak from."

I know it's difficult when you're lonely and have a pretty cousin, and you catch certain feelings. It's a lot less weird than people think. It's a little bit weird, but it happens, and it's not OPs fault for feeling that way. At least, I don't think so. It just means they need to find another person to attach those feelings to. Most people don't have issues with that, but many people do, myself included. It's a struggle. Best of luck OP!"

I think we just have to keep going. Not believe in ourselves, but just keep attending class, just in case future us figures out how to do any of this. If we give up now, future us won't ever get the chance. Maybe things won't ever get better, but maybe they will - we gotta stick it out just in case they do.

High school is a really rough time to be socially anxious. There's so many expectations for it to be this amazing, social experience. Plus there's so many TV shows and movies that say how it's supposed to be, and when your experience isn't anything like that, it can be pretty disheartening. Even more so when you don't have anyone to share it with. My high school experience was a lot like that too.

I struggle sometimes with having very few people to talk to or hang out with, and feeling unable to fit in because of it. But I'm working on it, and at least for today, things are looking up :)

I got accepted into one of my top colleges the other day, and this really nice gal I've been talking to a little bit said she wouldn't mind hanging out sometime in the next couple weeks, so I've been feeling pretty happy. Plus I tried doing postmates for the first time today, and it went well! It got me out of the house and let me have a little bit of human interaction without getting overwhelmed.
