MSI AG32C 32"" curve as main

Acer ET1 24"" vertically rotated as second monitor.

Problem: cant get aspect rations/scaling etc to line up whatsoever. The bottoms of the screens are possible to line up in windows 10 settings but that only solves part of the problem. Second windows do all sorts of weird shape changes etc when switching windows, no idea on that. Im really just wanted everything to ya know be the same size and stuff, and have one big wallpaper etc. But the final and main issue is when I move my mouse from one to the other the PC seems to think my MSI is a good 3-4 inches shorter in height than it actually is and will drop my mouse down a few inches. 

If yall have any ideas, thank you in advance."
