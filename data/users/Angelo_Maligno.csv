Well yes, after they get replaced by good robots. Then people are slowly going to go broke, unless of course they vote in socialist policies. Which they will because they're broke.  


> The numbers plausible?  Says who?  You?  You literally just made them  up. You donâ€™t even have an item they are making. Make believe numbers  are plausible for not even a make believe item. 

Well sure I made them up. It's just an estimate. Your still arguing in favor of my point with your other comments. These forecasts will tell you that you shouldn't make more of a product, and then you won't. Hence the market being finite. Increased productivity should mean fewer jobs in a finite market.

There is no need to be rude. We are just having a disagreement."

That means not everyone can have a job. It's also not hard to make it the cost effective choice in a factory. Since you can use robots to replace 3 potential 8 hour shifts of workers. Let's say you pay them each $20k a year, that means that a $60k robot that has the hourly production capacity of slightly greater then a human is the natural choice. It would also be cheaper over time. Amazon is leading the way.

Mostly because robots can work 24 hours a day. So 20 human workers per 20 000 units. The factory produces 20 000 x 365 = 7 300 000 units a year. Let's say this is the best possible case scenario and everyone on earth wants to buy a unit over the next year. 7 300 000 units x 1000 factories = 7.3 billion just short of the world's population. 1000 factories x 20 workers = a workforce of 20 000 people.

ShitPoliticsSays,fdyj10e,t3_enb2e4,1578780295.0,Yes let's end the human race because some dude hurt you. Brilliant plan. I'm sure it will pay off when feminists don't reproduce.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdtp4n0,t1_fdtjwi5,1578720035.0,"You're funny, I like you."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdtji9c,t1_fdtigbg,1578717659.0,Exactly. I rest my case. The left are bigots as well. Unable to cope with white evangelicals and creationists and their occasional denial of evolution and free market solutions. All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdti25z,t1_fdth82u,1578717058.0,"Well, how about you define bigotry then. By it's dictionary definition?"
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdtgfae,t1_fdtfrqo,1578716397.0,Not to mention the fact the left isn't tolerant of others viewpoints. Oh you want to cut funding for food stamps and just have private charities handle it? You are an absolutely immoral person. I refuse to tolerate you. Isn't it strange only your enemies are bigots?
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdtdr66,t1_fdtdiul,1578715303.0,You see it though. The definition is broad and does not encompass your point of view.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdtc8vi,t1_fdtaf54,1578714706.0,No you can still hate and have a conversation with someone you disagree with. You'll just be a bit hung up on the fact they do something you find immoral. Aren't you by virtue of declaring me a bigot also a bigot? We have different values and you refuse to speak to me. This is by your own definition bigotry.
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdtakyc,t1_fdsc6l3,1578714077.0,"Yeah sure, I agree but by his definition any sensible person with values is a bigot. Everybody hates someone. The only thing I see that is possibly wrong is hating someone for things that weren't their choice like race or sexual orientation."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdt8ykx,t1_fdsg2jm,1578713474.0,Aren't most people guilty of that though? Isn't that normalized at this point? Those who value law and murderers don't get along. How is that a wrong approach?
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdsc58r,t1_fds9pbt,1578699227.0,Well what is a bigot exactly in your mind? I've had a few drinks and I'm a bit confused. How does my previous statement make me a bigot? A bigot of who exactly?
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fds97ah,t1_fdrleg1,1578697252.0,"It's just funny that anyone says diversity is our strength. Imagine the most different person you knew in school. Very few of them were popular. People like similarity, common values and at least common ground to those of a culture that do something they find unacceptable. Diversity is simply lack of unity, though that's not a big problem in the states, most of the immigrants are Christian and hold similar values. Even if there may be a communication problem and a difference in voting patterns. Conservative Christians are still alright with conservative Christians. No matter how they vote."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fdr963p,t3_emq1sc,1578681151.0,"Well it raises a good point though. If diversity = virtue then it should be that all kinds of diversity are good. What you really mean by diversity is brown people that agree with your side of the argument. Go ahead and downvote, I don't give a shit how unpopular truth is."
science,fdnrax3,t1_fdnhk74,1578591295.0,Facts are exceptionally hard to determine sometimes. Especially if you suspect someone has motives to lie. A hierarchy of authority has to be correct to determine facts. This is essentially the problem.
depression,fdneei4,t3_em5w9m,1578584031.0,"Religion helped me to some degree, it's a flimsy crutch but at least it helps you along. The existential crisis is incurable from a material perspective. The impermanence of life gives no real meaning to our suffering, no reward for a hard life."
