medizzy,ffpugxr,t3_eue8ao,1580106165.0,"So ironic that someone with a disease most commonly caused by poor diet wanted to go with a ""holistic"" and ""natural"" approach to fix it.

Seriously, you can prevent soooo many health issues by just eating right and working out (not even crazy exercise either).

Israel,ffptpdm,t3_eubbax,1580105336.0,"Good.  Hopefully this is a sign of more open cooperation between both countries.

Imagine joint Israeli/Saudi military exercises in the Persian Gulf and surrounding areas.

Finding a partner wherein you can both support and enable each other to reach goals is much more important that I thought it was when I was younger--although fun and supportive is obviously the best case scenario.  It has nothing to do with money (not sure where you got that idea from), I have plenty of goals that aren't going to make me a dime.  It has to do with continually pushing yourself to become a better person, which includes gaining experience and effectiveness at higher levels of responsibility in work but so much more than that as well.  My personal goals are not motivated by money in the slightest and I would be more than happy to move up in responsibility (in both work and outside hobbies) without an increase in pay (if the opportunity presented itself).

It is not a waiver, however, because a waiver is something you can submit for to request an enlistment for someone not qualified.  In the CAT-IV case, if it opens as an enlistment category then CAT-IV applicants would be qualified.  A key part about CAT-IV enlistments is that not every CAT-IV can join when it opens.
