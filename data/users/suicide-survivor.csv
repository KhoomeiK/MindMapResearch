If you really thought it was such a selfish request, why are you announcing it to the internet? Not doing something, then announcing you didn't do it because it would have been selfish if you did, is almost as bad as just doing it.

E.g., ""Here, have the last drink. Not once did I take a sip, because I felt that would be selfish.""

PLUS they're tooting their own horn by announcing the fact they didn't pray for themselves, which the bible says NOT to do. Something about the left hand not knowing what the right hand did? If you think it's so, so selfish to pray for yourself, what's the point of telling everyone? ""Btw, I didn't drink the water I offered you, bc I felt that would be selfish."" Well, great, whatever morality you felt you gained from letting someone else have the last drink was sort of lost when you announced you allowed them to have it in your stead."

Do their genomes also vary by what region of Mexico they come from, or has all that local variation been smoothed out by centuries of different groups meeting, mixing, and having babies?

>To answer that question, the team collaborated with Mexico’s National Institute of Genomic Medicine, which has been collecting genetic data from mestizos for many years. Somewhat surprisingly, they found that mestizos in a given part of Mexico tended to have the same “rare” genetic variants as their indigenous neighbors. The mestizo genomes “track so well with the indigenous groups that we could use the genetic diversity in mestizos to make inferences about [their native] ancestors,” Pasaniuc says. Strong genetic markers of Maya ancestry, for example, show up in the genomes of modern people living in the Yucatán Peninsula and the northern part of Mexico’s Gulf Coast in the modern state of Veracruz, which likely reflects a pre-Columbian Maya trade or migration route.

>A cultural identifier denoting one’s belonging to a certain social class.

Social class refers to upper, middle, and lower class. It's literally defined as, ""a division of a society based on social and economic status."" It has absolutely zero to do with gender.

>You didn’t even read the quote correctly.

I quoted it word for word. 

>Everyone is always putting everyone at some risk when it comes to blood donation.

So it's perfectly ok for transmen to be deceitful **and potentially cause death** just because blood transfusions are risky? That's a really fucking shitty argument.

>The fact remains that being a transman does not put your blood at an increased risk of being harmful to recipients of your blood type, be they male, female or intersex.

Except it does?

>Their blood can’t “become pregnant” once it is drawn.

No, you see, pregnancy is a thing that can happen to a female person, and once this thing called pregnancy happens to a female being, it creates antibodies in their blood which makes their blood fatal to males who receive this blood because a woman falsely represented herself as a fellow man.

>The choice to socially categorize people that way at all is completely arbitrary. Can’t believe this has to be pointed out

No it isn't, because there are obvious differences between men and women. Hence why they are differentiated. Can't believe this has to be pointed out.

>Except all those intersex people, right?

Who have absolutely nothing to do with transgender people, right?

>You didn’t provide shit. You didn’t cite one police report, one news article, not even a confession post.

Because the link I provided conveniently listed all reports and articles for your browsing convenience...? It's not my fault if you're too ignorant and lazy to read them just because there's so many you're overwhelmed.

>That and society.

No, the way a society feels is not related to how a man feels about his penis.

>It depends on how other Mexicans feel and how society classifies you.

No, it depends on biology and science. On things like genetics. Not on how a person ""feels."" You're attempting to dismiss facts and reason to cater to arbitrary thoughts and feelings.

>That’s the issue with cultural artifacts. We decide how they work, not science.

So, you're saying you don't have the answer, because it doesn't exist, because a man cannot become a woman or vice versa.

>I seriously hope you find help for whatever emotional problems are causing your hatred and bigotry.

>I already proved this by citing examples of cultural genders that differ from ours and have existed since pre-historic times. I am the only one in this thread to have actually cited empirical evidence to back my arguments.

Lol, ok, I'll quote your ""empirical evidence"":

>>Terms such as “transgender” and “gay” are strictly new constructs that assume three things: **that there are only two sexes (male/female)**, as many as two sexualities (gay/straight), **and only two genders (man/woman).**

Your ""evidence"" sets forth the claim that transgenderism limits the sexes to two, male and female. What exactly did you prove?

>Their identification as transmen has absolutely nothing to do with their incompatibility. Transmen give blood to cismen all the time without incident. I repeat, it is perfectly healthy for a transman to give blood to a cis man in all regular circumstances.

Yes, it does. You're purposefully sticking your ass in the air and your head in the ground. Just because transmen give blood and there is often no incident, doesn't mean they're not putting men at risk by refusing to admit their female based sex that has the capability of becoming pregnant and producing antibodies that are capable of killing real men. So, no, it is not ""perfectly healthy"" to give blood to a real man in ""all regular circumstances"" because pregnancy is a regular circumstance, and it can kill men.

>The concept of man and woman is arbitrary, like most human constructs.

Categorizing penis beings from vagina beings isn't arbitrary. One category has a penis, and the other has a vagina. I can't believe I actually have to explain this.

>Amazing, you cited zero actual evidence, just a search for the word ""bathroom"" on thisneverhappens, which brought up multiple examples of this literally not happening. Genius move, I'm proud of you.

Pretending you can't see literal examples doesn't make them disappear? I honestly don't know what you're doing? Plugging your ears, covering your eyes, and saying lalalalalala???

>Gender is not determined by chromosomes. 

You're right... it's based purely on how a person ""feels."" If I ""feel Mexican"" does that make me latino? If I ""feel like a kitten"" does that make me a feline?

>This is a story of a person suffering due to being raised in a gender identity that didn't match their experience

No, it was a biological woman raised with expectations of another gender. 

This is exactly what the transmovement wants. They want to disregard biological sex and pretend to be a different gender. This is what messed her up, and is what is now fucking up many biological men and women, by chasing the wrong gender.

Tell me, at what point does a man become a woman? When his makeup is perfect? When his fetishistic dress satisfies his sexual urges? When he finds the perfect wig?

When, exactly, is he considered a woman?"

That's one of the many messed up things about transthink. What's wrong with being seen as a feminine man, or a masc woman?

They make it so people are acutely miserable being who they were literally born to be. They chase an impossible dream (becoming heavily sexualized anime catgirls) so that not only will you never be happy or satisfied by never reaching an impossible goal, but you're absolutely miserable to be yourself and they cultivate a culture of intense self loathing.

Where's the line? At what point is a man transformed into a woman? When his makeup is perfect? When he's satisfied with his fetishist outfit? When he triumphantly saunters into a women's bathroom, and women uneasily look away and say nothing to him out of fear, and he interprets this as success and acceptance? Is he then blessed with womanhood?

At what point is a man a woman?

Or is there never a point... it's been a man in costume all along.

The objective reason is the scientific, biological difference between male and female. 

>No, they can’t. Being transmen isn’t what caused problems, getting pregnant is. If a “real man” with the wrong blood type did the same thing, the other person would still die.

The fact they insist they're men when giving blood, so that their blood isn't properly categorized as female/possibly pregnant blood, is deadly. Yes, if a real man insisted his type O blood was type B he could also kill a person. But we can see in both cases, the one insisting the falsity is delusional/in the wrong.

>Seriously, this all just seems like you feel strongly about your opinion here so you’re willing to ignore clear anthropological facts.

What was that? Pot calling the kettle black? Interesting. Look in a mirror little buddy.

>When the hell did I say biological sex isn’t real? Haven’t I affirmed the “realness” of biological sex multiple times? Haven’t I said multiple times that biological sex, while real, has nothing to do with gender identity or trans issues?

No, you have said multiple times that sex wasn't rooted in biology and that the concept of men and women were arbitrary. Soooo. Yeah, nope.

>Using masculine pronouns to refer to trans women is your assertion of an opinion

Yeah, that is my opinion.

>This is such an unjustified leap in logic that it’s ridiculous to see written out so plainly.

>Christ, this is all cultural nonsense backed up by your feelings of fear, hatred and disgust towards trans people. None of this bigotry is based on science, especially not biology or anthropology.

Ok, so you're again insisting that biological sex isn't real. Cool.

>There is nothing stopping a cis male from doing this right now. There are virtually zero cases of trans women assaulting other women in bathrooms.

That's because cis males respect women's spaces. The only men that want access to women's spaces are predators. Hence why it's unnerving that biological males are insisting they have the right to invade women's only spaces.

Lol, ""this literally never happens!"" Ok then.

I don't mind gender neutral. I just don't want biological men in a women's only space.

Did you read your own source? Her chromosomes are XX. Her parents tried raising her as a boy and it fucked her up. That sucks her genitalia was mutilated and I agree that intersex children should retain autonomy over their body, including their genitals.

I don't see the relation to trans people except for the damage done by trying to raise a biological woman as a man, which is what trans people want... so..."

It IS mutilation, it falls under the definition of mutilation, just because you don't like it doesn't make it untrue.

I never said mutilated bodies harm me, I answered *your question* of what the difference between a bio body and a trans post op body.
