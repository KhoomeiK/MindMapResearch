politics,fg7lsn1,t1_fg7f2uz,1580595626.0,"Really appreciate your reply. I don't disagree with your points, except that the type of development that occurs tends to not always affect those communities positively. 

In my own city, we had a major transportation project built. It was designed to bring in jobs, but was also shown to have little positive employment-related advantages to the neighborhoods along the route. Cause: saturated service sector and this project was aimed at skilled positions. Overall better for the community, but these individuals in these neighborhoods who do not benefit continue to be pushed towards the periphery. 


In a situation like this, it is moving a problem from one place to another. 

I do have to say the development and planning was rushed and the onus for a community safety net falls on city councils, etc. and not on developers and investers. This complete profit focused approach is part of the problem it seems, and developers and investers should be held to a higher standard. ""Should"" represents a value statement though.

I don't even know how this could be meaningfully regulated or shifted to a more holistic approach. Better representatives? They still have to make it through the meat grinder of politics. I am sorry for being so cynical. 

Last question, in planning for projects like this, how far into the future do these plans look? They actually seem to be quite forthright with their results, be they negative or positive and I'm impressed with some of the transparency. In my local case, we haven't been told everything and I don't think everything was published either. Right now we are left with a compromise (due to rushed policy, implementation, etc.) and have this huge bond to pay off."
