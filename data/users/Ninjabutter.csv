sadcringe,ff9mjm2,t1_ff9k5z4,1579716126.0,Was it a girl you had a crush on but not with or was it an ex that you were not over yet?
Stoicism,ff93986,t1_ff558av,1579703771.0,Yeah. It‚Äôs a good one for sure
Stoicism,ff936vf,t1_ff6xo6s,1579703724.0,"I‚Äôm guessing maybe just trying to tolerate the anger that someone/something and hoping to get used to being angry. Where letting it go is more accepting the situation and being sad that that‚Äôs how it is. 
I‚Äôve learned if I‚Äôm sad about something like loss or someone‚Äôs behavior I‚Äôve accepted it as it is and the sadness passes. When I‚Äôm angry about something I‚Äôm using energy to muscle through the frustration and I‚Äôm less likely you accept it. 
Just my 2 cents. Hope it makes sense but I accept I‚Äôm not an especially eloquent speaker."

YangForPresidentHQ,fds3n7s,t1_fdrzayx,1578693781.0,"Eh don‚Äôt let it bother you. Anything you read posted by randos on the internet isn‚Äôt worth it effort. I don‚Äôt know your options on anything but if it‚Äôs worth it to you than it‚Äôs worth while. 
Have a great weekend friend."
YangForPresidentHQ,fds3aps,t1_fds19tv,1578693654.0,Omg if he was saying this he would already be president. I‚Äôd help him move into the White House.

killteam,fdl6v9r,t3_elwk11,1578518051.0,That looks wicked cool and I would be fine with it. That is a corrupted flail if I‚Äôve ever seen one.
gifs,fdju0bb,t3_elj6q6,1578487444.0,He crushed it. The flower girl bar has just been significantly raised.

worldpolitics,fdeqg34,t3_eknc3s,1578344464.0,"New background for my work puter. 
Thanks for sharing!!"
worldnews,fdeq9zf,t3_ekwlgd,1578344363.0,That makes me happy to hear. It just so happens Trump is our biggest problems too! We need to work this out with out violence.
ImaginaryWarhammer,fdepwtp,t1_fdeccjr,1578344149.0,I know. I was just playing around. Good luck man!
worldnews,fddxnkk,t3_eku1g1,1578326475.0,"As long as no American Civilians are harmed and they blew up, burned down or vandalized some of Trumps own personal buildings I think lots of American people would laugh. 
I can‚Äôt for the life of me understand how killing their famous general would NOT escalate this. The general was obviously not our friend but slaying him helped nothing. It made a bad situation worse."
ImaginaryWarhammer,fddeyys,t1_fdczsn4,1578309217.0,"No, I was clear I loved the picture. I would absolutely love to have that hanging on my Man cave wall. Wink-wink nudge-nudge."

Are you applying for Duncan‚Äôs old Job to do YouTube painting tutorials? You‚Äôre probably going to nail the position if so.  My only suggestion would to focus on two thin coats. If you thinned out your paints a little bit it might help....JK. 
I love this picture."

Eldar,fcx6431,t1_fcx01b4,1578052794.0,I had read to use non-wax parchment paper and use the other kind. I wonder if it works better or worse then the non wax kind.
Eldar,fcx613s,t3_eja0dl,1578052699.0,Plain parchment paper works the bomb for me. A $1-3 dollar roll from the grocery market will give you a lifetime supply is you don‚Äôt already have it in your kitchen.
Warhammer40k,fcx5pi0,t1_fcx4qih,1578052321.0,The Doritos would really add a lot. I‚Äôd go with cool ranch.
Warhammer40k,fcx5n88,t3_ej7yc9,1578052245.0,"I think it came out great and will provide a nice shadow effect for anything you put over it. I wonder how earth shade would have came out. Oh, and don‚Äôt forget to highlight with a light dry brushing. 
Thanks for sharing"
worldnews,fcvfh73,t3_ej11dn,1578000993.0,"War is hell. 
I‚Äôm not saying for one second what he did was ok. If he‚Äôs a serial killer then everyone who kills more then one person is a serial killer in that theater."

killteam,fcuawxx,t3_eixju4,1577976715.0,"That look cool. I only think of fake models as Poorhammer not the terrain. For all we know that‚Äôs a

Cringetopia,fcu1ppt,t3_eir3ou,1577969637.0,I hear you. Too funny but their not hurting anyone so F it. Leave them alone and enjoy the show.
Cringetopia,fcu1b5k,t1_fcu0s85,1577969189.0,Same here. I don‚Äôt hate them at all. I think it‚Äôs a hilarious hobby/lifestyle and cringetastic to occasionally see on the interwebs.

Mindfulness,fcl11th,t1_fcky1mr,1577737492.0,"Dang, that will make it hard to dial back I bet. You‚Äôre taking steps to try and do it regardless though. I think that it‚Äôs really mindful of you to pursue this knowing it. So no matter what it‚Äôs a strong first step."
natureismetal,fc6bq1o,t3_egc5af,1577476851.0,Very metal. I wonder if the hog got got.
funny,fc6986y,t3_egcfbz,1577475189.0,This is amazing.
CCW,fc691th,t1_fc61274,1577475072.0,I don‚Äôt do this but think this some good wisdom. I think I‚Äôll be following your system.
CCW,fc68te0,t3_ege7ph,1577474918.0,"Damn! I‚Äôm a stickler for perfect or as close to it ammo and would have turned that into noise long ago.
