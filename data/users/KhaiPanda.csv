MomForAMinute,ffhuh77,t1_ffhst0d,1579954481.0,"They would have only been able to see me twice a month, and their first appointment wasn't even until the end of February. My psychiatrist got in touch withe current therapist and are discussing ways to make the next three months with my non-insurance issue. They are also planning on getting together with me to have a crisis team meeting to see what they can do about me and the fact that I need some more intense services. My gut is telling me they are going to make themselves more available to me for a short period of time by phone after hours for crisis/emergency type situations. That would honestly be the best route right now. But I don't know and probably won't know until next week. 

As for how I'm doing, not so great. Probably about the same as last week. My psychiatrist has on basically suicide protocol at home. She called my husband and asked him to hide my meds, and told him that I can't be alone until further notice. It is unfortunate, but probably the right move for where my mind is at. 

I did work my last day at my old job which was a very stressful, 12-hour 3-4 day a week work week that was an hour away from me. Driving away from it for the last time yesterday was the first time in a long time I genuinely smiled. Deleting my 5:00 am alarm last night was also a nice feeling, so I think I was underestimating the stress of that position. I have 2 weeks of training with my new position, then I get to start making me own schedule, and working about 1/4th of it from home, which will also be nice. So. Maybe things will start changing. My psychiatrist has been telling me since probably September or October of last year that she'd noticed I'd been decompensating quite a bit since I took the position an hour away from me, and that I needed to start looking for something in my town, and I ignored her until probably mid-December when a situation happened at work and my anxiety went through the roof and stayed there for weeks."

I'm a hopeless case that just exists and wastes money on specialists and doctors and shit that's not working. Tomorrow I'm pretty sure my primary care doctor is going to tell me something is wrong with my heart, which is going to be even more money. I'm in so much medical debt I can't ever imagine paying it back. The only logical answer at this point is me relieving my family of the burden that I am."

Everything hurts. Physically, emotionally, mentally. I'm hurting. My psychiatrist is the only one who understands and cares, but she has a part time practice, and I don't want to bother her when she's off.

That one we saw an ultrasound of, and she was alive and there and had little appendages, and a strong heartbeat, and she was fine and then two weeks later she wasn’t. This one... I found out I was pregnant, found out it was double the length of time that I thought possible, and that heartbeat. It had a heartbeat.

The way it works at my community college is I gave disability services a letter from my psychiatrist... it also may have been from my therapist... that outlined my disabilities and any accommodations I may need. Then disability services sends a letter to my professors each semester that basically says, “khaipanda requires these accommodations” and lists them out. Stuff like extra time on tests... that’s the main one I remember because that’s the main one I use being an online student. 

Also, in my experience I have found that it helps to be as open as possible with professors when/if you are having a bad time of it. I was having a severe depressive episode and emailed one of my professors just to let him know I wasn’t doing well (no details), and asking him how much the zero would effect my grade. He emailed me back giving me an altered assignment and an extended due date. I have had this happen a couple of times. I’m not saying be a dick and use your disability to get over on your education.
