cats,ffedsf0,t1_ffdrno9,1579844305.0,"Don’t get me wrong, my kitty hates it and it sounds like an exorcism when I do it. I have done it for the past year or so since she is too old for dental anesthesia (15)

I have a cat toothbrush that looks like a regular toothbrush but with a smaller head (got it on amazon). 

I get on my knees on the floor and sit her between my knees facing away from me, kind of holding her in place. I bring my left arm around against her chest, then reach up and pull her lips back and press lightly on either side of her jaw to get her to open up. Then with my right hand I use the toothbrush on one side, then reload the toothpaste, then do the other. 

make sure you get an enzymatic toothPASTE (rather than gel). There is one on amazon callet CET that my vet recommends. When it has enzymes, just having contact with the teeth breaks down debris so the scrubbing isnt really as vital. Make sure kitty doesnt eat or drink for a little bit afterward to allow the paste to stick to the teeth. 

Goodluck!"

I am by no means a superstitious person, but I truly felt that it was him moving on, or letting go, but I just felt a sense of “I’m okay, I love you, thank you”, and I’ll never forget it.

I had to let my little man go in the ER that day, and while it was sad it fet more humane than some of what I have done to keep people alive in the ED/ICU. 

I think hospice/palliative care is the most humane type of nursing there is."

The one drawback is usually the best surgeons will have the most cases, i.e. you will have to wait longer for the evaluation and procedure. It’s worth it. 

However, the best people to ask about a surgeon are the OR and postop nurses who see them in practice and deal with the surgical recoveries of their patients.
