AmItheAsshole,ff09mly,t3_eqwol3,1579466644.0,Does he have condiments on his burgers at bk? Cuz if so you should mention that extra sugar isnt keto. And lots of sauces are carb heavy. He just seems like a jerk

AmItheAsshole,fen0ukw,t3_epvp5n,1579274452.0,Dump him. Never have contact with him again. Ever. Just crutch(cuz the broken foot) on outta his life. You are so young. You can and will do better than someone that doesn't care about you.

AmItheAsshole,fdow0yu,t3_emdtnh,1578614161.0,"I dunno.... been together 4 years and you did a massive transformation and didn't even tell her, id be bit sad to not be even told about such a drastic change. And sudden changes gave her reason to be slightly worried that you were maybe doing it for the ladies around were you were. 
Sudden change can create insecurities. Change is scary. Just give her time. But maybe dont spring anything huge on her without some warning:) but good for you on getting healthy! Keep it up:)"

AmItheAsshole,fdjdz44,t3_elomoj,1578466849.0,"You think maybe hes been to jail and thats where he got it? Or maybe his past is bumpy and hes made bad choices? Think maybe hes trying to better himself but cant afford to laser the thing off. 

You said you work in Toronto, and the laws there say you have the right to refuse service, but not by grounds of discrimination(turns into human rights violations). He isnt pushing hate and is not mean or aggressive , you just hate his crap choice he made in life and dont even know how or why its there."

vancouver,fdh7poz,t3_el8wsi,1578417184.0,"It doesnt seem like things are getting better in regards to the homeless and addictions issues that Vancouver has. We keep upping taxes and putting money into the issue but the numbers keep rising and the crime and issues get worse. Obviously the action plan isnt working and its time to think of a new strategy. But if you notice the panhandling has become rampant. Commercial drive used to have about ten, they were spread out. Now its at least three or four (some in groups), each section or block. They all ask for money and get upset if you offer food or clothes(response is usually ""wtf can i do with that!?"").  I have no idea what a positive step would be in getting people off the street and into productive members in the society."

AmItheAsshole,fddtra2,t3_ekl7hw,1578323762.0,"I dont wanna pry, but what type of treatment options were you given? Please tell me you went for a second opinion. I was given a diagnosis and told id never have kids. Went to different doctors tried different things. I ended up being my own advocate since doctors can be quick to shut ya down or put you on meds(they try some estrogen things and androgen blockers). One doctor helped with suggestions of literally no added sugar, more green veg than fruit(no bananas cuz the high sugar), lots of walking, normal bmi(not obese or overweight). Basically a total life change. Even giving up booze. Also adding spearmint tea(looseleaf, organic) everyday! Periods got back on track, i lost 20 pounds, and was able to reproduce if i so felt(no longer infertile). 
Just keep trying to better your general health, and be prepared for the worst, but never stop hoping for the best."

entitledparents,fd6hw07,t3_ek5vjx,1578191275.0,The school should know you won it and can be witness for you. But talk to a school counsellor and see if they can report her. Taking your stuff is technically child abuse i think.

vancouver,fd661oe,t3_ek4bls,1578186022.0,"We got/had better pot shops before legalization. 
But my absolute favourite thing about living here (just over 6 years now), is the fact you can walk absolutely everywhere in this city. Skytrain makes it easy to get further out, but you can walk the entire city relatively easy. Commercial broadway, walking downtown to Stanley park takes about an hour or a lil more(depending on your walking speed). Downtown walking to south marine takes a while but its a lovely walk. Also theres so much food but its too many options so i have a hard time picking what to try. I still have places i need to try and keep finding new ones to add to my list. 
So walking and food and pot. The best things about Vancouver"

I sometimes hear how the family get comfort from hearing a heartbeat from a heart transplant or to just know they their loved ones life is still living thru another. 

Never hurts to try"

AmItheAsshole,fcull8c,t3_eix270,1577983674.0,"Not the a-hole, but it depends on who is the one that's supposed to be making the parenting choices. 
Is your sister going to be raising the child once she is done school or are you going to be the child's guardian for life? If your sister is the ""parent"" and will be again, then its her choice how she wants her kid raised and you should respect that. If not, then make choices that benefit the child as you are doing :) best of luck"
