However, homosexuality doesn't present any of the challenges being trans does. It doesn't make you uncomfortable in your own body. Plenty of people suffer from self-image issues; most of them aren't trans. If you can figure out a legit way to help trans people live their best lives, by all means. Until then, transitioning seems to be the solution. And it's not an easy one.

videos,fej3j7t,t3_epby76,1579155547.0,"The irony that transphobic people are only making trans lives *even more* difficult when all they want is peace of mind. A person being trans does no harm to anyone, same with sex, race or sexuality. It's terrifying how deep-seated these hateful feelings are when most people are just trying to live their lives.

I realized I was gay at a young age and felt all the usual negative feelings that come with it. Yet I can't fathom how much tougher it is for trans people, who have to deal with:

1) Not understanding their own feelings, especially before they're aware of what's happening, esp at a young age where you're impressionable and society is already conditioning you.

2) Discussing said feelings with others, particularly people they hope they can trust ( family, friends, partners ) and possibly being shunned / MURDERED over something that literally hurts NO ONE but the person struggling with it.

3) Coming to terms with 1 and 2 and taking first steps to transitioning. Sometimes this means 'passing' for the sake of their mental state. Hardly a simple endeavor most of the time. Painful binders. Long hair and 'feminine' clothing while trying to fend off stubble or other dysmorphia factors.

4) Having to get the green light from professionals who don't always understand or sympathize. 

5) Hormones. If they're difficult for teens already, just imagine how stressful it must be to start changing your body in such ways.

6) Surgery. Bills. Complications. Recovery.

7) Readjusting to a new body and life; physically and mentally.

Transphobes and those that 'just don't understand': Please tell me again why someone would CHOOSE all of this. Suicide rates are high for those in the minority. All because you 'just don't understand'. If you truly want to understand, ask 'how can I help' instead of injecting your unnecessary judgments into their lives ( because I too often see questions that seem like mockery more than genuine ).

Im cis and have simplified some things, but hopefully this gives some perspective to consider."

Games involve many forms of art.

Visual ( graphical, design, etc. ) - check out games like Okami, The Unfinished Swan and Cuphead for some great examples. Some things to note: architecture, different worlds / ecosystems, character design. It's a vast category!

Storytelling - any game with a story, though many are pretty much novels and have some great storytelling. Personally, Skies of Arcadia and Golden Sun are favorite examples of a compelling and well-written plot. 

Music - from the early days of beep beep to Zelda's orchestration. Personal faves for music are Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles and Silent Hill 3 ( OST ). Also throwing in Michiru Yamane in as one of my favorite game composers.
