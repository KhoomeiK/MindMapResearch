TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff1y3qt,t1_ff18p5k,1579488832.0,"I went there while I was in Japan about a year and a half ago. It was kind of a let down. The aesthetic was really cool, and the construction was all really well put together. But the novelty lasted for about 15 minutes. It wasn't really worth the trip. It was something like an hour and a half from where I was staying, and the only thing for us to do was play the same arcade games we could reach easily in Akihabara (much closer), but in a (intentionally) grimy feeling place that stunk strongly of incense. Admittedly poor planning on my part. Probably more worth it if you are in Tokyo for more than a week (not that it matters now)."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,ff1pmwz,t1_fexa5f5,1579483375.0,Rods/skyfish were apparently a “real” thing that only showed up on camera. Some people claimed they were creatures too fast to be seen by the human eye. It was actually just regular insects flying across the frame during an exposure causing the insect’s path of motion to be captured in a single image.

TwoBestFriendsPlay,feajlnh,t1_fe97rt2,1578949603.0,">long debunked ANIMATION BUDGET meme

That’s to do with business, not animation technique. And it’s still not entirely inaccurate, as even though the price per cut is mostly consistent, there is still a concept of time budget allocated to certain scenes and episodes (although Woolie is of course talking about the big bucks from what I recall).

>60 FPS

Gonna need a source on these, especially the sakugabooru one. If you’re referring to the AMV discussion, that’s because people who do that interpolation are fine tuning it by hand for the specific pieces they are using. I have seen ones that look legitimately fantastic, although it fails terribly as a generally applied technique.

>	Pat doesn’t talk about it

This is sarcastic, right? While it may not be a common topic, Pat has talked about the technical side before. But the main thing I’m thinking of, which I am unfortunately unable to find right now, is a somewhat recent conversation that Pat and Woolie had on CSB about animation. I remember going in prepared to be annoyed by ignorance, but ended up pleasantly surprised that they knew what they were talking about."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,fe95o6d,t1_fe8r98e,1578934508.0,Both Pat and Woolie seem pretty well informed when it comes to animation.
TwoBestFriendsPlay,fdyggh4,t1_fdybt0a,1578779557.0,"If the original was developed with any amount of modularity, then the backend parts that do all of the language processing for different languages should be relatively easily integrated into it once developed and trained. Additionally, they’ll at least be making some set of basic animations for the new models, work which could, again, be directed toward the existing model (although I’m sure they’d be less lively).

The real deal is that whatever company is looking at this wanted the futuristic look of a hologram in a tube (but on the cheap) so that they can market the “next step in virtual assistants ™”. But they don’t want an anime girl because they’re looking to market it to companies who want a respectable looking persona that the general public will not find uncomfortable to interact with. Most people would probably feel pretty uncomfortable being seen talking to the waifu."

TwoBestFriendsPlay,fdiy760,t1_fditb6e,1578453751.0,"It can depend on the setting. That is the sort of standard starting conversation people in my uni anime club (and presumably other places where people are meeting under the pretext of mutual interest) do.

I want to say, I don’t wholly disagree with you. I just think that liking similar things shows a possibility of a deeper similarity. If two people really like Nier, then they probably like it for the narrative, and they might hold some similar philosophy. That’s what’s going through my head when I envision these conversations. But of course that’s not guaranteed."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,fdisraf,t1_fdiotu7,1578450217.0,"Alternatively

Liam: So you like Nier, huh?

Clemps: Yeah, it’s pretty good.

Liam: What did you think of [theme, moment, etc.]

Clemps: I felt this way.

Liam: Really? I felt other way.

*Discussion continues...*

Yeah, it’s not just that simple, but it helps. Nothing will really help with incompatible personalities, but similar interests give people something to talk about and chance to find a deeper connection."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,fdig6oc,t1_fdifg5c,1578442173.0,"It’s almost like I addressed that in my comment. And you’re also ignoring the fact that Clemps and Liam are known to like a lot of the same things, Nier being probably the best example."

Yes, anime as a medium is not a homogenous entity, and neither is the anime fandom.
