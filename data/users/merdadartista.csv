Not saying it's bad to drink a glass of milk once a day (I personally do) but we need lots of liquids to keep ourselves hydrated, that's a lot of extra calories. That's without considering the shits you can get from drinking too much milk, the fact that drinking too much of it can make you lactose intolerant and how bad of an idea is to drink milk while exercising.
