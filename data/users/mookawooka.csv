Like any other commodity, you ending up in a position you wanted for the lay you wanted is not the goal or priority for these people, after all, they are doing work that you aren't paying for so no reason to act in your interests.

AskGaybrosOver30,ffag5ym,t1_ff9dqp1,1579734980.0,"All the advice in this thread is absolute crap. It's a cesspit of depressive and flippant answers.

Probably the reason is, there is no answer. We still get the paternal instinct and it's not so much about you ""being 33 with plenty of time, plenty of fish"" etc. so much as the worry deep down that it will *never* happen due to being gay and stories of success so rare, compared the natural breeze our peers seem to follow, settling down and moving on.

Well there are two ways to get as close as you can to the lifestyle eventually. Fulfilling your life and existing/nee relationships in such a way that it fills the void, and having kids through adoption/surrogacy. That's it. There's no point in pondering much further about the physical reality as these are your options. 

In the mean time make the effort to enjoy life and get out there where the more exposure to new guys you have, the more likely you are to meet the right one.

I get it though, sometimes daily sometimes less often - the moment of sadness knowing it won't just fall into place or you can't just up and decide to have a family at any point. It's a lot harder for us but I remind myself, not impossible.

One thing this means is we will cherish our relationship and family when it happens. The norm seems to marry and have kids no matter what, but our norm is enjoying life for ourselves, so you don't need to hear that ""advice"" for the 100th time over just to ignore your innate urges and cognitive sadness just to get on and ""live"". I hope this helps settle things."

Ops old job was like school, people turn up because they have to and therefore it becomes very social.

We live in a career world which tends to come first (makes sense considering the time put in) but success is completely arbitrary and leads to many seemingly getting so bogged down, they miss the thousands upon thousands of people who reach old age and regret the excessive hours of neglecting time to chill and forget about day to day problems with reality.
