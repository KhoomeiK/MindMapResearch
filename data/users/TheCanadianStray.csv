SuicideWatch,fejt4lx,t3_epjezf,1579185208.0,Talk to me. I mean if you need to vent. I still recommend you also seek professional help.
SuicideWatch,fejt0td,t3_epjjc2,1579185133.0,"Your message was truly beautiful, I honestly followed a very similar path to yours. The results are the same as yours, I’m generally happy and enjoy life to the fullest. We owe it to ourselves to push through the pain to experience something nice."
SuicideWatch,fcot32l,t3_eibh76,1577840795.0,"Hey buddy, 
I swear your comment hit hard, I also got help hard and I still live with some of the consequences from my experience. I also had troubles finding a reason to keep going but I’m glad I did because I got to live pretty experiences.
I would suggest you open up to friends, but if you feel like you can’t, I’m here to talk. 
You said you didn’t feel like a person anymore, may I ask why? 
I want to help and hopefully send you into 2020 with positive energy."

AskMen,fck3lkv,t1_fcj8j7h,1577715575.0,"Yeah, but many people just don’t care about trying, so if you do, it makes a better impression on others."
AskMen,fch0h7n,t3_eh65b5,1577645991.0,"I try to make myself special by treating her right, not like an asshole, by surprising them, by listening, by getting her little gifts and doing small gestures like opening the door.
It makes me think that I am doing something most aren’t."
SuicideWatch,fcf1wck,t3_eh59rn,1577625897.0,"I get it. It’s just there are also some barriers I feel that stop us from really helping sometimes, things we can’t really overcome, like distance for example.
There’s not much more we can do here but try to guide you so you find the answer that suits you best for your problems.
And regarding psychologist and psychiatrists, their job is not to take your depression away, rather guide you and help you see a way you may not have seen before. The hard work is truly the one you have to do on your own as depression is a very personal subject and the same thing that got me out of mine may not help you sort yours.
I’m sorry I can’t offer more at the moment but if you need to talk or vent I’m here for you."
SuicideWatch,fc71gwl,t3_egdhyc,1577495007.0,"I do also at times believe that people just care about our money. It’s refreshing coming to check this sub-reddit, people here help without asking for any payment whatsoever and they do it willingly.

This shows there are people in this world that care about others people wellbeing, although those are the hardest people to find. I know life can be hard, I went through some pretty rough moments myself, but there are moments that come in the future that are worth living for to see. And that’s why it’s good to keep living, not surviving, living.

If you need to talk though, I’m here. I’ll be happy to listen."
SuicideWatch,fc70dj1,t3_egdj4t,1577494175.0,"I feel you man. It’s super hard to vent to my best friend because he never truly understands me. I will tell you one thing though, there is no one who can understand you as well as you can understand yourself. Maybe looking for a best friend is not about looking for someone who can understand you, but looking for someone who will accept you no matter what you’re going through.
If you need to vent though, I am here."
SuicideWatch,fc6zzuh,t3_egfzi9,1577493888.0,"I’m sorry for your loss. Don’t blame yourself, some cases are really hard to help with. Do not blame yourself for what happened. It’s sad but you had no hand in her actions."
SuicideWatch,fc6zpj6,t1_fc6roh2,1577493676.0,Really Well written
SuicideWatch,fc0dqxi,t1_fc0cspx,1577287998.0,"I know it really seems everything is hopeless, but keep looking I believe there is something out there. The universe may have aligned against you, but you are still here, you can choose to keep on fighting."
