I'm married and I work 50 hours a week. I work out most days at the gym. My average night is probably a lot like your average couple: I work, work out, eat dinner, watch some TV snuggled up with my wife, and go to sleep. 

I only have so much time to really engage with stuff beyond that. I'm sure SF has billions of things to do but I have WAY too little time to engage with them. Since I spend so much time at home, it's nice to have a home that's comfortable and spread out. 

If I was, say, the ""idle rich"" yah I'd be quite bored. 

I'm not totally discounting it. I'd love to have access to all the things you do. But I would only really use that access 12-24x a year. Meanwhile I'd be paying 3k a month to live in an apartment. 

May I ask what your relative income level is? Is that unfair? I just don't see how someone making 50k a year in SF is really able to engage with all that the city has to offer. But you live there, I don't."

There's little traffic. I can get clear across town in 10 minutes. My house note/taxes/insurance is 750 a month.

The only gun rights they would defend are the uneven application of restrictions. So a blanket ban on pretty much anything is fine. Targeting a class of *people* however is not kosher, for example those with a mental illness or immigrants. 

They offer zero protection for any actual base level gun rights. They see no problem with an assault weapon ban. I don't see anything they write that would take issue with ANY ban on firearms. 

Furthermore, they see no problem with required licensing. Imagine if there was a ""required license"" for an abortion. They would, and should, see that as an OBVIOUS avenue for pro-life areas to set up a de facto ban. We already see this with gun licensing in anti-gun areas. Try getting a gun license in Chicago.

The solution is low but not 0 inflation. This allows a stealth wage cut to happen. Everyone not getting a raise is getting a paycut. Why? Businesses are charging you for stability. Finding a new job, relocating, and thriving in a new environment are hard and stressful. So, just stay here! It's comfortable and what you know.

A billionaire can buy whatever they want--except leave it to their kids? Why? To handicap them a bit lest they be so educated and enriched that they outcompete others, aka ""opportunity hoarding"". Or we need to prevent them from never having to work again. Basically we want to force them to work but we also don't want them to be outrageously capable of doing so. 

The moral argument is muddled. 

When taxes are confiscatory, people avoid them. The higher the tax, the more worth it it is to avoid it. You want to get rid of gangs? Legalize drugs. Their financial underpinnings are built on artificial scarcity of supply. Want to create a legion of financial fraudsters? Threaten to take 90% of someone's money for the express purpose of knocking their children down a notch. 

That money will just be transferred in any one of a billion ways. Suddenly, Bezos Jr. starts producing art that daddy buys for a cool million a piece. Ir they nice assets over seas.

Maybe women who feel shame over their abortion do not wish to engage with that shame by filling out the survey. 8/10 wouldn't respond because surveys suck and they are lazy...and maybe .5 more who would respond to a survey don't want to respond to this survey b/c of shame. 

Maybe those women who are very pro-choice wanted to ""do their duty"" and push the numbers ""the right way"" so that headlines could be written and the zeitgeist shifted. Normally 8/10 of these women would ignore a random survey but .5 ""step up to the plate"" to push the stats their way.  

I'm a liberal Mississippi white guy. There are dozens of us. I relish surveys about politics because I feel like I can finally be counted and, frankly, I'd like my state to at least *look* a bit more blue, maybe make it that much more ""acceptable"" for a straight, white, male Mississippian to be a Democrat. 

There's also an act I've done I regret. I would actively avoid doing a survey on this act because I'm ashamed of what I did. I don't want to revisit it or explore my emotions regarding it. I want to bury it as much as I can."

I did something long ago that I'm very ashamed of. I would not want to fill out a survey targeted towards people who have done what I did. I don't want to think about it. I don't want to revisit it or consider it in my conscious mind. I want to get away from it as completely as I can. The LAST thing I would want to do is calmly bring it to the forefront of my mind and focus on every emotional aspect of what what I did, why I did it, and how I feel about it now."
