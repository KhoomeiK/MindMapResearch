horseracing,ffs4mf3,t3_euv54v,1580173015.0,"Because you can generally tell early on in a horse's career if he has a chance to be a graded stakes winner.  Because that's the only way into a stud career.  And that rules out like at least 95% of the male population, probably more.  So you want to make a horse more trainable and less likely to hurt himself acting crazy in a stall.

Ask yourself the flip side of your question.  Why would owners and trainers geld horses if it costs them money every time?  The simple answer is they wouldn't, but since it doesn't, that's why they do it."

Fantasy,ffg15n1,t3_etenk5,1579896211.0,"Jordan always introduced equine characters as if everyone checked the status of their genitals first thing.

EDIT TO ADD:  For all those people arguing how important it is, how it matters, blah, blah, blah.  That's not the point.  I own horses.  And you can't tell a horse's gender, etc., without really specifically looking for it, and at most angles a layperson looks at a horse, YOU CAN'T TELL.  People look at a horse, and they see ""horse"".  The look at the head most often (muzzle, eyes, ears), then maybe mane, tail.  Most will not be able to distinguish breed or gender.  And, that's the whole point of this article.  They can use a male horse to play the part of a mare.  Because you can't actually tell.  Unless you check.  Not that it isn't important.  But RJ writes as if the narrator is either an equine vet or an thoroughbred auction caller.  It stood out to me then as now as ridiculous.

My point is akin to introducing someone to your dog.  If your dog's name is gender neutral, a guest may inquire as if your dog is a boy or a girl.  They can't tell AND they're not going to pick your dog up and turn it over to find out BECAUSE they don't care.  Like the horse's gender status, 99.99% of all people don't notice and don't care.

(Plus in a matriarchal society, why is Moiraine the one riding a stallion thats 17 hands tall?  Funny that how in a world with plenty of gender inversions, equine-to-character fit in RandLand is as traditional as it gets.)"
