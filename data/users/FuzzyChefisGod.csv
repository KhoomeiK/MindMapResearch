selfimprovement,fcni2tt,t1_fcnbxhn,1577812152.0,"It really really does. If I still had me reddit coins I would give you a award. Thank you for that. The emotions I feel are a mix, some I can’t even identify. There is definitely a fear of lack of validation, and a constant anxiety of what will happen to me. A anger for my own actions and my decisions to stay in the mindset I was in.

 I grow up in a town that is relatively small. Most of the people I go to school with all act the same, dress the same, and seek the same goals in life. I know deep down inside other people have insecurities and issues with themselves, but since I don’t fit into one crowd it’s hard to relate and find help. My interest and hobbies range from hunting, mechanics, outdoors, and my love for my straight piped truck, while on the other hand I love to work with computers and have recently token up the hobby of 3D printing. 

I struggle to meet people and worry to much that they will dislike the other part of me. I pass my interest off as stupid and I’m fact did this the other day when a girl
I’m interested in asked me about 3D printing. For no reason I insulted my interest and made a fool out of myself.

It’s little things I do that fuel my fires, and it’s my fault and I can’t stop."
