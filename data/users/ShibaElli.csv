I think most people use ESA laws to get their larger pets in-cabin, though, instead. The fee isn't bad on most airlines (less than $100)."
dogs,ffdffzo,t1_ffdetin,1579819755.0,"If your dog is in a crate, they don't need ESA laws anyway. That means they fit in an airline approved crate that can go under the seat. That's fine. That's not the point -- the person above you commented about a leash reactive GSD. Very different situations and laws."
dogs,ffdeyft,t3_et0dtk,1579819460.0,"I'm going to be up front. I just did this, we're about two weeks and change out.

It was filled with the highest highs and the lowest lows (my post history shows this). My girl bonded to me right away, but we did have issues. She just is starting to let me sleep at night, which was definitely the worst part for me. I frequently messaged friends saying things like ""I need a vacation from my dog"" and ""hey do you want a dog?"" haha.

The truth is, you're going to to have to try a bunch of things to and see what works. Reese wasn't food motivated -- surprise! Sometimes I lost my cool and scared her (you'll do this too, it happens). I feel bad. She messes up and feels bad. She pees on something you like. She gets sick. You're stressed. I cried last night throughout my shower because I was so mentally and physically tired.

And then she let me sleep ten hours today, or in the morning, when I let her out of her crate, she comes into my bed, cuddles, and falls asleep for another three hours as my little spoon. When I pick her up to bring her outside (I live in an apartment building with stairs and her legs are too short) she'll lift her head straight up so I can give her a kiss on her snout. Highest highs, lowest lows.

It's going to be a rollercoaster. She was much harder than my dogs I adopted previously. Just stick with it. There will be set backs -- her and I were doing so good until last night. But hopefully we'll have another good week or two and keep moving forward.

Good luck. I know this is ramble-y (I am still very tired) but I hope the sentiment comes across."
dogs,ffdd8kp,t1_ffdcsf3,1579818429.0,"My sleep doctor wrote it. It was accepted by my apartment complex and by the plane, adoption agencies. I don't think that is a hard and fast rule; narcolepsy is one of the conditions allowed, but narcoleptics don't see therapists (for narcolepsy treatment, anyway).

Edit: Just googled it. Federal regulations just say ""physician."" A lot of people who self-train their service animals have them classified as an ESA while training is on-going, so its really important to remember that any physician can prescribe an ESA."
dogs,ffdczi3,t1_ffcr5nk,1579818271.0,"Seconding this. A few other ideas. from someone allergic to dogs:

1. Obviously, you first need to figure out how allergic he is. For example, I am allergic to some dogs and not the others. I know near immediately after petting a dog. It is not breed specific (I thought it was). I met a few Shibas, had reactions to none of them, adopted a Shiba from afar... guess who I'm allergic to?
2. Does your dog have dandruff? This is a huge thing to look out for. See a vet if they do. I realised I react to Reese because of her dandruff. I can't fix hers (allergy related, but also on a prescription food), so she gets a thorough bath every two weeks or so (as long as I can make it, essentially). If your dog gets bathed at home, make sure you thoroughly clean the tub for your roommate.
3. You also need to figure out ""how"" reactive he is. I could probably live with most well-taken care of dogs, mostly because I love dogs. Badly taken care of dogs would kill me. I also, for example, have asthma -- my pulmonologist was so mad at me when she figured out I took a job at a groomer. She has no idea I adopted a dog, haha. Figure out where he stands -- its possible that there is no way to make this work, at all.
4. Other methods to limit dog hair: Bissell makes a portable, cordless vacuum. I thought it was a scam. Then one of my neighbours had one for his kitties... my world was changed. That thing is so good at picking up hair.
5. Also, if your Pomeranian goes through shedding seasons, it might be worth it to invest in a groomer dryer at home (nothing fancy, just like, the Flying Pig ones). They're $200, but essentially stop seasonal shedding because it all gets blown out with the dryer. They're great. but you need to have a way to control the hair wherever the dog gets dried, obviously. I also suggest being very serious about brushing her daily, or twice a day.
6. Also consider a snake for under your door -- they have ones that don't even attach to the door. I loved these things when I lived with messy roommates - kept their mess out of my room."
dogs,ffd3rii,t1_ffczx6r,1579812846.0,"Was about to say the same thing -- consider an older dog. And a smaller one at that. 

My dog hasn't figured out toys/brain games and like 60% of the time drives me nuts. She's calming down and figuring it out (I think I fully slept through the night for the first time last night since adopting her over two weeks ago-- ten whole hours haha -- she's exhausting!). She does best right now when I devote several hours day to walking her. She's picking up toys and games slowly, but... slowly. 

If you want a dog, I would honestly roll into a shelter (not a rescue) and tell them your situation and ask them if they have dogs that would match your energy level. Be honest. 

I also strongly recommend against a dog if your the type to worry about their health or are too depressed to get them to a vet. My dog has been to the vet so many times in the first two weeks alone. You never know what health situation you're signing up for with dogs, especially older ones, so that's another thing to keep in mind."
dogs,ffczfd6,t1_ffcub66,1579810413.0,"What about on the plane?

Me and my dog got attacked boarding a plane two weeks ago by a dog that was already seated. Blood, diarrhoea everywhere -- my girl and I both ended up needing medical attention -- cost us $3,000.

From one ESA to another, maybe consider a different dog as your ESA if they can't safely be in public. They cannot be crated on the plane."
dogs,ffcz39h,t1_ffcobw9,1579810226.0,"See, my ESA isn't through a therapist. I'm narcoleptic. 

This doesn't quite help the issue at all."
dogs,ffcytp7,t1_ffcrnok,1579810079.0,"This is me too, except for narcolepsy. I have type 2 narcolepsy, aka, instead of falling asleep at random, I just sleep when I'm not busy. Dog keeps me busy (oh, does she).

I had a shit experience two weeks ago flying with her (home from adoption). She's in an awkward size where she's slightly too big for cabin, slightly too small for cargo. I appreciated having her in cabin due to the laws, and we got bit (both of us) by another dog as we turned into the aisle for boarding. Real shit.

In a way, I'm happy if changes are coming. In another, I'm sad because I would not have been able to adopt her otherwise."
doggrooming,ffcmual,t1_ff9o07n,1579802808.0,"You probably meant to reply to the commenter above. 

What I can say, as someone who recently adopted a dog with a similar-ish coat (Shiba Inu) -- and I used to be a groomer's assistant. I just got the zoom groom for my girl, and I LOVE it for shedding.

I am NOT convinced it is not what is causing her very micro matts near her skin. Make sure you brush him with a real brush as well."
dogs,ffayq25,t3_escg4d,1579747581.0,"I am very tired. She's doing good. I love her. But I feel like I get the puppy blues with my adult dog.

I was very happy until she had an accident. It's been a week and a half since she had one. I walked right into it. She felt bad, I could tell. But I had taken her out an hour before. What the hell?

I felt so defeated. It takes awhile to clean efficiently. It means yet another night of eating garbage food and feeling like shit. I feel like I fall so behind on taking care of myself and my life this month. I haven't even looked at my CC bills and I am afraid to, for all her treatments, and no one knows whats wrong with her.

I still have to walk her. I'm going to take the recycling out. It's not her fault. I'm just tired. I just want to sleep. I just want to take care of myself.

Edit: 10 minutes after I post this, she started dragging her butt across the floor. I don't think its anal glands. I am so, so, so low."
dogs,ffajann,t1_ffa5d7x,1579737122.0,">Stinking doesn't make it bad.

Second this. My girl's food reeks like high hell. It's also prescription food from her vet. I actually looked at her this afternoon and said ""I have no idea how the hell you eat this.""

It's her favourite thing in the entire world. She goes bonkers if she thinks I am even THINKING of getting it for her.

It's Hill's as well, haha (their canned kidney diet chicken stew).

Stick to the WSAVA guidelines as listed above. This food is fine. If you want to try something less stinky, that's fine, but make sure its either from Purina Pro or Royal Canin (or Iams and Eukanuba I think have been approved as well)."
dogs,ffaiu3a,t3_esissx,1579736780.0,"My dog was fast to potty train but she liked to have accidents in inconvenient spots. I can't help with the stopping behaviour, but I can help with keeping future spots to a minimum.

You need to invest in an enzyme spray. People like Nature's Miracle -- for me, nothing got my girl's smell out like Clorox Urine Remover. I don't know why I've never seen it talked about. I use both for good measure, though.

Then you need to get a portable, cordless carpet cleaner tool. Bissell and Hoover make them, I'm sure others do. They're about $80-$150. I know, its pricy, but listen, it will save you a lot of money down the line and you'll be thankful you already have it when your dog ages or for any future accidents they have.

Then you'll want to get a matching pet odour carpet cleaner (I'm not picky). If you want to be really thorough, also buy a bar of fels naptha soap.

The way to get the stains out as they happen: first paper towel it the best you can, and use the machine before you treat it with anything and get all the liquid out. Then I go over it several times with the enzyme spray, the urine spray, and the carpet cleaner -- passing over with the machine each time. It will take a lot of time. It takes me like 30-60 minutes when my girl has an accident. Then I go back over it with water, pour it on the effective area, and spend time really working the fels naptha into the effected area, pull up again with the machine. I go over one more time with the enzyme spray. Let it dry out.

I've never had so much a smell, stain, or even dried spot when all was said and done. It might be overkill, but I am a renter, I like my stuff staying nice, and I have pretty severe, legitimate OCD around cleanliness. This is my approved method A+."
dogs,ffagvgn,t3_esjl8l,1579735447.0,"I used to work at a groomer. 

I'm not personally familiar with your breed, but it was really common to give dogs sanitary shaves, especially the older ones. 

If that's all she needs, you might be able to find a groomer that will do it cheap for you, regularly (but no promises). I'd keep up with it at least monthly, depending on how fast it grows back.

She will probably look a little silly, to be honest, but it comes with the territory. My favourite pet parents were the ones that came in and made fun of their dogs. We had a corgi mom come in and she couldn't stop laughing at his sanitary shave -- it happens. A lot of dog owners will understand :)"
dogs,ffafsby,t3_esje72,1579734723.0,"How big is your dog?

I dealt with this a lot with my larger dog as a kid and I always just put myself between them. Never got as bad as your case (not judging, just observing! I support you; I'd do the same thing).

I got a pup who weighs about 20lbs two weeks ago and *everyone* wants to attack her. Everyone. I have gotten so good at speed-scooping her up. Why does everyone want to go after my dog? Weirdly frustrating.

I went through a similar thing with my new dog on my second day with her. You should like you were worse than me (my hands are stared to heal and look mostly okay). I hope you're doing okay, congrats on thinking quit, being a good dog-momma and keeping your girl safe."
dogs,ff85gi1,t3_es6djx,1579666512.0,"It's literally a stickied thread at /r/askvet \-- so yeah, your vet is correct.

AskVet,ff81a86,t1_ff50jfi,1579663370.0,"It actually got more poetic!

I found the auction house she was at, by dumb luck? They only had one dog of her breed and color that day. There is a *huge* age discrepancy -- I really think it is my girl, though. The vet said that she would have had to been up for auction in order to be vaccinated that day. The auction house gave me the auctioned pup's microchip number (weirdly nice people despite their profession). It didn't match Reese's, and we went for a scan today to see if she had a second one and we did not find a second microchip.

I just assume that auctions be sketchy. I have no other explanation because everything else points to that dog being Reese. That dog (Hannah) was about a year and a half old, and was not sold. The auction told me they don't follow up post-sale, but said that she was marked as ""do not return to breeder"" which usually means they are euthanised. She said its possible the breeder arranged for a shelter to pick her up instead, which sounds like what happened. My shelter is sort of known for getting calls and urgent situations where they just get up and drive hundreds of miles to pick up like 100 dogs, so honestly, that fits. 

To make this a poetic ending, Hannah is one of my legal names. Hannah the dog's last litter was also listed as being born on my birthday. It honestly leaves me with so many warm fuzzies of ""meant to be"" that I've accepted I will never know her age or health-- I don't think she looks six or seven, but I also don't think she's one. I think she's probably 2 or 3 and was ""aged"" appearance-wise due to puppy mill abuse. 

Reese will stay Reese, for convenience sake, but I love her very much. I feel like her and I bonded a lot over the last couple days, even if she didn't know why."
