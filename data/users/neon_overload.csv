What you see isn't quite as dangerous as it looks, but is a lot more clever than it looks.

Earbuds,ff7lc9i,t3_es3ngd,1579652287.0,"For gaming (where latency would an issue) nothing Bluetooth based is going to save you.  There's no getting around the latency.  Some products like the Razer Hammerhead or the QCY T5 have a special low latency ""gaming mode"" which tweaks SBC to reduce the latency, but it still has latency, and that latency can vary.  See, Bluetooth is a best-effort communication medium.  Data is sent in packets, and if the band is not clear the sender waits to transmit until there's a gap, and if the receiver didn't receive a packet it re-requests it.  Latency needs to be built into the system for this to work and the most reliable bluetooth chipsets pick their latency based on traffic conditions to minimise the chance of having a break in audio, and/or they pick a high-ish latency to start with.  Bottom line is, if you're gaming you should be going wired.

For movies on your iOS or Android phone (except the YouTube app on iOS only) latency is corrected by the OS so you shouldn't have much problem.  You may still have some audio delay, but it won't be the full 200ms or whatever the real latency is, it'll just be a few ten of ms here or there.

On Android, AptX works better than AAC which is why it's desirable.  On iOS it's the other way around (iOS has much better AAC, and doesn't do AptX).  AptX won't significantly affect latency.  There was a separate product called AptX-LL which is now defunct which used a lower latency but required operating outside the Bluetooth standard.  And even then latency still existed, probably about as much as these low-latency gaming modes popping up on some buds now.

Sorry I probably spent way more time on this than I needed.   I should have just said - for gaming where latency is an issue, get wired.  For anything else, if you want budget true wireless you could consult [scarbir.com](https://scarbir.com)"
