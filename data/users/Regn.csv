sweden,ffmru0e,t1_ffm3njw,1580058288.0,Inte OP men jag har också pluggat med lurvisar. De är precis så socialt missanpassade som du tänker dig och de kunde inte alls förstå det själva. Väldigt mycket lolsorandom.

uppsala,fei010i,t3_ep7wv5,1579127343.0,"I finished my studies a couple of years ago now, but I'm still a member of my nation. Me and my friends visit from time to time just to grab a few bears like we used to do during our studies, then we gossip about our former classmates and reminisce about school. We don't really party hard anymore, so I guess it's mostly for the nostalgia now..."

HadToHurt,fegrw81,t1_feg9okb,1579101104.0,I still remember the first time I had to do CPR on a patient. The first three compressions went *crunch crunch crunch* and then it felt a bit more spongy after that. So weird.

aww,fcioge1,t1_fcins74,1577666104.0,"Yeah, I think they may simply need more time with their parents. It's the same with everyone I know that has kids, both parents have to work full time so I guess it's hard to spend more time with them."
aww,fciji05,t1_fcid9kd,1577663595.0,"Just like with my sisters and friends kids. Neither of them show any interested in toys, all they ever crave is their parents phones/tablets or the TV.

I've tried to give different stuff to test what they like and play with them to get them going, but they always lose interest and go looking for a screen after a little while. They've got shorter attention span than me, and I have ADD...

I don't get it, I had lots of video games growing up but I still liked playing with my toys or going outside to play using my imagination just as much. What happened?"
hmmm,fc2k98x,t1_fc2it8p,1577364492.0,I think it's more about the nostalgia.
