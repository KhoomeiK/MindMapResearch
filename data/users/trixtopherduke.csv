But I asked to see the volleyball shoes and just about every brand has something similar. I like the thick, flat rubber sole, and they're not very heavy or clunky like I thought they'd be. I used to use a flat soled running shoe which was lighter but came apart at the sole within a year, and these volleyball shoes seem to have more support for my feet."

A fencing coach told me that volleyball shoes are cheaper and hold up the same or better than fencing shoes. I have never tried fencing shoes, so can't vouch for it. Before this pair, I wore a flat, running shoe but the sole was thin and eventually ripped away from the shoe. *Edit: this pair was around $60"
