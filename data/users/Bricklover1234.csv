I can't speak for the US, but I'm doing a B.Sc in germany and I'm pretty often worried about getting a (suitable) job (after a M.Sc or Phd), especially in science it seems like there are a way to many graduates for the jobs available (I'm not saying there is unemployment on a large scale, but the people working in adequate positions in some fields is frightenly small)"
