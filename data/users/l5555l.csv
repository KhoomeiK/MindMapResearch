modernwarfare,ffb2yuz,t1_ffb2ssj,1579750467.0,"If someone enjoys the unlocks so much that they don't actually attempt to win a game because that slows down their unlock progress I would say they probably don't actually enjoy the gameplay.

Never once did I say anything about side missions (which are clearly not the same as cosmetic unlocks) or say that these people are ""shit."""

MaddenUltimateTeam,ff85nfg,t1_ff851wy,1579666666.0,Maybe their speed stats. Never their coverage stats. At least in my experience.

MaddenUltimateTeam,ff7ylky,t3_erpln5,1579661458.0,"Idk what the play is called but it's in shotgun with 3 wr and 2 rb/fb in the lions playbook. Left outside receiver runs a 15 yard dig, right side slot receiver runs a drag, outside right receiver runs a post. Rb2 runs right into the flat, RB1 does a really quick block and release route that basically ends up going the exact opposite way of the slot drag route. Usually the two short, underneath routes cross middle of the field at the same time, forcing their user mlb to pick one to cover. So if I cant throw to the dig or post it's an easy 5-8 yards, or more if i can get a quick juke in. RB in the flat is like a last ditch, rarely used option. I'll hot route him to pass block a lot of the time.

edit: it's called x dig in formation gun split offset. And I guess the rb2 runs a wheel not to the flat. My guy is always just too slow to get to the corner before I need to throw to him lol."
MaddenUltimateTeam,ff7y9jl,t1_ff4howr,1579661221.0,He means inside and outside. If you have them both on you technically have perfect accuracy for the whole field.
MaddenUltimateTeam,ff7y4bq,t1_ff4xgtk,1579661123.0,You must have something wrong with your shit then lol. If you can't kick in this years madden idk how y'all would ever make kicks. Madden 17 and 18 were literally like guessing. The accuracy click just stopped whenever it felt like it.
