Then I started realizing that some repairs that are $500+ at the shop can be done for $80 in parts and an afternoon of labor. And youtube is an excellent reference.  
  
And most minor repairs are like, take the bolts off of the part, pull part out, buy new part, bolt new part into place old part came out of.  
Yes, there are things that are certainly very complex. But a lot of minor repairs aren't so bad.
