In 2017 (the most recent year I could find figures for) Bill Gates gave away $138 million, in other words, just under 0.14% of his $100 billion net worth, or the equivalent to his income over an 8 day period (assuming a 6% annual return on his $100bn investments).

Yeah sure, there are plenty of world class pianists that will make mistakes, or take a long time to learn a piece. But there are also people that can sight read symphonies at the age of 8, or write a concerto before they're old enough to buy a drink. Those people are unarguably gifted, and no amount of practice will allow somebody without those gifts to achieve the same level of competence in so few years.

I don't know why we're so obsessed with telling people that ""nobody is gifted and you can be just as good if you practice enough"", when it's simply not true. It also seems to be a very American tendency to believe that ""anybody is capable of achieving something if they put their mind to it"".

AskScienceDiscussion,feketui,t3_epkmsj,1579198560.0,"As others have already given good explanations, I'll give the simple answer:

The speed at which something orbits a body depends only on the radius of the orbit. Two bodies orbiting at the same radius will orbit at the same speed, regardless of their mass. And if one body is given an extra ""push"" to speed it up, the distance it orbits at will change as well. The further out an object orbits, the slower it travels, and thus the longer it takes to rotate around the centre.

- Higher spectral resolution

- Ability to interchange instruments attached to the telescope
