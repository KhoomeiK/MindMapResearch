Nietzsche,ff2vjib,t1_ff2qqe4,1579525796.0,"Not OP, but Nietzsche gives this an answer in the GM:

> But it was against precisely these instincts \[i.e., the value of the unegoistic\] that there spoke from me an ever more fundamental mistrust, an ever more corrosive skepticism. It was precisely here that I saw the great danger to mankind, its sublimest enticement and seduction-but to what? to nothingness? - it was precisely here that I saw the beginning of the end, the dead stop, a retrospective weariness, the will turning against life, the tender and sorrowful signs of the ultimate illness; I understood the ever spreading morality of pity that had seized even on philosophers and made them ill, as the most sinister symptom of a European culture that had itself become sinister, perhaps as' its by-pass to a new Buddhism? to a Buddhism for Europeans? to nihilism? (GM, P/5)  

Nietzsche seems to portray it as a linear development or a natural consequence of the values which are cultivated in our current milieu. Values such as the unegoistic, the instincts of pity, self-abnegation and self-sacrifice, just to cite those values which Nietzsche inserts before the quoted passage. 

The issue is: people require some kind of higher value, some commanding force in their lives. Even Nietzsche. This role was traditionally given to some kind of transcendent or supernatural power (the gods). With each passing day, the belief in any kind of *supernatural* force or power becomes increasingly impossible to maintain (the Death of God). But, this does not remove the human need cited above. Something has to fill the void.

If Christianity (or monotheism generally) cannot fill this void, then something along the same lines *must*. Something which already carries values that are in 'circulation', if you will. On Nietzsche's understanding, Buddhism represents a philosophy of pessimism - it elevates pessimism to a higher position. Now, given that the collapse of traditional beliefs tends to elicit pessimistic feelings, a value-system which endorses pessimism and the negative values (self-abnegation, self-sacrifice, etc) stands ready to receive all those who have no other spiritual home. It's either that or a full-blown, unabashed nihilism --- well, there is *another* way, but most people aren't going to be very receptive to it.

>What Europe owes to the Jews? Many things both good and bad, but mainly one thing that is both best and worst: the grand style in morality, the horror and majesty of infinite demands, infinite meanings, the whole romanticism and sublimity of the morally questionable – and, consequently, precisely the most appealing, insidious, and exceptional aspect of those plays of colors and seductions to life in whose afterglow the sky of our present European culture, its evening sky, glows away – perhaps goes away. **This is why, among the spectators and philosophers, artists like us regard the Jews with – gratitude.**  (BGE 250)

Or:

>Meanwhile, what they wish and want instead, with a unified assertiveness even, is to be absorbed and assimilated into Europe; they thirst for some place where they can be settled, permitted, respected at last and where they can put an end to the nomadic life, the “wandering Jew” –; and this urge and impulse (which in itself perhaps already reveals a slackening of the Jewish instincts) should be carefully noted and accommodated – in which case **it might be practical and appropriate to throw the anti-Semitic hooligans out of the country.**  (BGE, 251 - the entire section actually)

Or countless other comments and clear denouncements of antisemitism.

Nietzsche,feeijkw,t3_eops6a,1579034458.0,"Ancient philosophy (well, a lot of philosophy and theology) cleaved all of reality into two pieces: [the ""apparent world"" and the "" real world.""](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Appearance_and_Reality) The most prominent example being Plato and his doctrine of Forms.

The 'apparent' world is the world of our senses: what we can directly experience, see, touch, hear, etc. This world is contrasted with the 'real' world, a world not accessible to our senses, but perceptible by *reason*. Here Nietzsche is calling it the ""true"" world, but it is the same thing whatever you want to call it.

There has been a remarkable bias against the 'apparent' world in the history of philosophy. Since Plato, many (if not most) philosophers who held to this dichotomy have privileged the ""real"" world and denigrated the ""apparent"" world. This is the background you need to know to understand what's going on here.

So... what does #6 mean? How to interpret it?

Nietzsche says in section 5 that the 'true world' is of no further use - this is because science has rendered a belief in this sort of metaphysical error completely untenable. Also, the death of god figures here, since, without any belief in god, we simply have no *need* to posit this two-worlds nonsense.

The points behind 5 and 6 are Nietzsche's way of saying, positively, that a revaluation of values is now at hand (or at least, should be). By throwing out the whole ""true world"" business, we have necessarily thrown out the ""real world"" parts as well - seeing as how they are two sides of the same metaphysical coin. Now, given the death of god and the collapse of some crucial metaphysical ideas, it is time to wipe the slate clean and begin anew. That is why it is noon. That is why it is the end of the longest error (the error being the mistake inaugurated by Plato and compounded by Christianity and Kant.) That is why Zarathustra enters the stage, because he brings with him a new message for humanity - something to fill the gap left by the death of god and the collapse of metaphysical nonsense. 

That's the gist of this whole section.

Nietzsche,fe8td0u,t1_fe8on67,1578930645.0,"That's not his point. He is not suggesting that he has in mind specific books that are superior to others, that are for elite eyes only, or the like. 

His general point is that there is an order of rank among values, not a universal set of values that can be imposed on everyone. His point is that there are value systems that are 'higher' than others in some sense, and that there are appropriate and inappropriate value systems for peoples (and cultures) depending on their own drives, their specific wills-to-power. 

> Reflecting on your comment i'd ask for books that then are produced from the 'superior' position as manuals, doctorines summaries or in some shape that do not ""smell of the common masses as they are dirty"". 

The most obvious example in the Western canon is the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament is addressed only to a select group of people; assigns to them higher values; demands of them certain sacrifices and restrictions; etc etc. The New Testament is written in Koine Greek, addressed to the masses; it pronounces values that are for everyone, no matter what; assigns no higher values to men; demands virtually nothing from anyone, and so on. You can easily read these texts from this perspective, and it is rather apparent that the Old is superior to the new (according to Nietzsche's criteria). The NT is pretty much the bottom of the barrel for Nietzsche; he even says somewhere that one should wear gloves when reading it. :)

Then you could compare the OT to, say [Epictetus' Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Encheiridion-Hackett-Classics/dp/0872200493/ref=asc_df_0872200493/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312820231662&hvpos=1o4&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7492980576504512701&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010756&hvtargid=pla-606830378154&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=67906663571&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312820231662&hvpos=1o4&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7492980576504512701&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9010756&hvtargid=pla-606830378154). Yada yada yada, it would be clear that Epictetus' book is even *higher* than the OT (for various reasons, but all because of the criteria Nietzsche uses to rank systems of value). 

I would suggest the following, as this is really the crucial test: If you can't stand the though of *hierarchy*, of an *order of rank* among values, of *inequality* as a brute fact of existence and moreover *a value to desire*, then you're better off just sticking to the moral philosophy that is churned out everyday. The other way around: if you believe in your heart of hearts that everyone should be equal, should be held to a common standard, that equality is something worth desiring for itself, then looking for books/thinkers that do not hold this view will only be counterproductive and even harmful for you. You should perhaps meditate on that for a while."

Readings:

In 1887, Nietzsche wrote this to Peter Gast:

>Dostoevsky happened to me just as Stendhal did earlier, by sheer accident: a book casually flipped open in a shop, a name I had never even heard before—and the sudden awareness that one has met with a brother. . . . four years in Siberia, chained, among hardened criminals. This period was decisive. He discovered the power of his psychological intuition; what's more, his heart sweetened and deepened in the process. His book of recollections from these years, La maison des morts, is one of the most “human” books ever written. \[...\] I first read \[...\] two short novels \[“The Landlady” and Notes from Underground\]: the first a sort of strange music, the second a true stroke of psychological genius—a frightening and ferocious mockery of the Delphic “know thyself,” but tossed off with such an effortless audacity and joy in his superior powers that I was thoroughly drunk with delight. \[....\]”

In that year, he read *The Injured and Insulted*; *The Raw Youth* (or the Adolescent; or An Accidental Family depending on translation); *Notes from Underground*; *Demons*.

Read Demons again (not clear?!) in 1888, French translation.

It is not clear if Nietzsche read Dostoevsky before the period 1886-1887.

Edit:

Regarding *Crime and Punishment*, Nietzsche writes to Peter Gast that the French have staged a version of ""Dostoevski's principle novel,"" but it is unclear whether he attended the production of was just aware of it. It is not clear whether he actually read that work."

There's no reason to accept this at all. Have you ever heard of one animal-rights activist who didn't couch their activities in moral terms? I've never heard one person give a flippant, *l'art-pour-l'art* rationale for ending animal suffering.

What is the intrinsic value, the end-in-itself, that would prompt someone to take up the cause of reducing animal suffering?

They want most institutions to fail, so that they can argue for their closure and thus ""shrink government,"" which satisfies the wealthy and only benefits their interests. At least there used to be some kind of ideological argument here, and the whole idea was a wedge issue for them. Now it seems they've gone over to complete nihilism. The rich act with impunity, flaunting their brazen behavior like a point of pride. I can't remember a significant piece of legislation that has not been crafted for the overwhelming benefit of the überwealthy. These Mammonites control an astonishingly disproportionate share of the wealth; refuse, scheme, and dodge taxes, and generally enrich themselves at the expense of the national interest and common good. 
 
I originally intended to condemn the GOP but it is clear to me that the Democrats are also beholden to the wealthy class. Two *billionaires* are unironically running for the liberal ticket - primarily because they are concerned for their economic interests, although they undoubtedly think of themselves as socially progressive. 

The bottom line is money. Money is power. Too few people have too much power because of their wealth. They live in an alternate world, beyond laws and rules. They are never beaten by the police. Their lives are never ripped apart by the state. Because money is power, and because the state commands a monopoly on power, the state serves the interests of the wealthy alone. This glaring political contradiction cannot be resolved by taking current sides in partisan debates, because at the end of the day it is income inequality that is making a mockery of democratic values everywhere."

It wasn't that our OP quoted Nietzsche: it was because the quote didn't explain anything; nor was any explanation given for why the quote was posted. So it was basically a random, drive-by quote that didn't add anything of substance to the discussion, and thus it was removed.
