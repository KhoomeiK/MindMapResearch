Them pulling out of Comic Con cause they couldn't even face the fans after the mess they've made was the final nail in the coffin.

But it's not like they ended up with nothing though, since companies were basically biding for them in the end as to who gets to have them working for them. In the end Netflix got them for 200 million. Maybe this might have had something to do with the Disney contract too, since Disney and Netflix are now competitors."

It was a bit confusing to read as it's a bit messy in expressing its ideas, and it ends so sudden without an explanation as to what actually happened when he dissappeared. I thought by the end of it that the writer forgot what he started to write about. It gives a great insight into David Chase's personality though. It's amazing how much of that he put into Tony's character. ""I'm not running a writing school here"" sounds a lot like ""I'm not running a fucking popularity contest"".
