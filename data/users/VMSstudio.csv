MurderedByWords,ffjfiv6,t1_ffjffzi,1579997169.0,You’re wrong. give it up already
MurderedByWords,ffjfdq0,t1_ffjf7va,1579997085.0,That’s socialism. Seems like you have no idea what you’re talking about
MurderedByWords,ffjd54w,t1_ffj9spj,1579995777.0,Socialism didn’t work here either. You think USSR was. Immun ist? It tried to be and it failed so it stuck with socialism and that also failed. Brezhnev or Gorbachev didn’t have communism going on this had socialism but even then socialism failed. I love how you talk about “American books” but we’re here telling you from first hand experience how it SUCKED! GG kid
MurderedByWords,ffjcugg,t1_ffj6g5b,1579995604.0,"Born in USSR here. I’d say you’re wrong on the account of popes. In socialism everyone is poor. But then again you’re also wrong about the rich.

Factually backed by USSR history."

MurderedByWords,ffjbz2c,t1_ffjar76,1579995096.0,You do know that that happened under Obama too right? You do know that a lot of photos that came out were from Obama era?
worldpolitics,ffhool5,t1_ffgzwk1,1579945715.0,May be because the fourth one doesn’t happen during NFL? I don’t think they have as much problem with people kneeling during their private time. NFL is different in a way that it gets put in their eyes. I’m pretty sure people would be outraged even far more if one of the NFL players did a Sieg  heil during the anthem.
investing,fff9pji,t1_fff9hsf,1579879157.0,Oh no I meant let’s say they’ve been getting a lot of income and the shares have gone up. When they pay dividends the stocks might already be up before the dividend announcement. No?
