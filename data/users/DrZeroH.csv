worldnews,ffavd9y,t1_ffaseq1,1579745363.0,Exactly. Apparently the person in seattle was someone working in a top tech firm which means he has the education and financial flexibility to actually get tested like this.

Many MANY people in the US are not nearly as proactive due to a combination of many different factors ranging from shit healthcare plans to laziness

BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff5hti7,t1_ff5hr6h,1579593516.0,Yeah its easy to get it all mixed up. It was a really big dynamic picture so some details get obfuscated.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff5he2x,t1_ff5h7d3,1579592962.0,Yeah honestly it might be for the best for the quirks to be relatively redundant. Maybe Hori is backpedaling on the decision this way by sticking to most of the quirks being relatively redundant (like float).
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff5hbkl,t1_ff5ch4j,1579592874.0,"https://www.mangapanda.com/boku-no-hero-academia/227/9

I reviewed the pages a few more times.  I don't see any indicator that he threw up on his hand. Actually at the moment of killing off multiple people his face was still covered with his father's hand and spinner mentions that it looks like he didn't touch them. I think its just so many people were close enough together to touch so they disintegrated together as a result of having been touching each other.

https://www.mangapanda.com/boku-no-hero-academia/239/9

It looks like the previous poster is correct that there is a ""physical connection"" requirement for Shigaraki's power to transfer between objects. If something is floating/flying and they don't touch anything already disintegrating they probably won't get turned to ash."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff5gt35,t1_ff5gr6k,1579592224.0,"While I agree with the concept that Deku should have focused more on creative ways to apply the original power (shooting air through his fingers is a good example of this), at this point he has made the commitment. Its best to just accept that this is to be the way things are."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff5gqc1,t1_ff5glct,1579592127.0,"Well to be fair it wasn't so much ingenuity as much as brutal practice. Most people who see his quirk can understand relatively how to make it overpowered. Its some next level shit to actually make it so (example phasing THROUGH eri to hit the guy behind her) (phasing through attacks while striking simultaneously). Hell, Naruto's Tobi had a similar power to this but could ONLY be in a phase through state or attacking state, not both at the same time."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff54gb5,t1_ff53qmf,1579579958.0,Hmmm is that how ofa works though? I thought it empowered the original super strength quirk and stacked new quirks. We see no evidence of it empowering black whip?
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff524p7,t1_ff4zoht,1579578166.0,Hmmm. Good point on that. That being said is that exactly how his quirk works? I thought there was an aerial component to his quirk? Like a cloud (based off how he killed a crowd of followers when he first awakened his quirk again). Then again its possible they were all touching each other which is why his quirk hit multiple people at once
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff4yk2h,t1_ff4mvxr,1579575547.0,Isn't Comics Scarlet-Witch one of THE most powerful existences in the MCU?
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff4y6xd,t1_feyzxxd,1579575294.0,"Thats the problem. Their fucking Hulk is gone. All-Might is wasted and he had the power equivalent of both Thor + Hulk mashed into one. Without him I highly highly doubt the current hero association has the strength to fight back without talking foundation crippling levels of damage. I won't be surprised if MOST of the Top 10 get axed.  The only one that seems somewhat safe is Endeavor... wait no scratch that Hori seem to be setting him up to die by some dramatic encounter with Dabi which ends with him saving many people and serving his role as a martyr but ultimately dying. Hawk SCREAMS death flags.  

Jeanist might already be dead or being set up for some dramatic last minute save. 

Shield Hero Crust, Wash, YoroMusha are all prob gonna die they are just fodder.

That leaves Edgeshot, Miruko, and Ryukyu.  Miruko looks safe because its likely she will get more development.  Ryukyu might get axed as a way to motivate/traumatize Ochaco/Tsuyu.  Idk about Edgeshot they might axe him too just for good measure."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff4x916,t1_ff4x0z5,1579574637.0,Yeah but then again I feel that the previous users MUST have already applied some combination of their existing quirk and the already existing stacking Super Strength power of One-For-All.  I think the truly inventive/cool stuff will come when Deku starts combining previous users quirks rather than already existing Super Strength + User Quirk
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff4wx9s,t1_fezvmpy,1579574415.0,Her thighs look like it can crunch cars.  Reminds me of that Rabbit girl
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ff4wejh,t3_eqxb3r,1579574055.0,"Oh baby mama Nana was stacked as fuck. 

That being said... not to diminish Nana's quirk at all but isn't Float somewhat redundant for Deku if he were to obtain all the quirks?  Black whip already is a strong mobility quirk once it becomes effective (also its a fucking amazing capture/assistance support quirk).  For Deku it shores up a potential weakness in his overall repertoire. 

To explain why I think its redundant All-Might already had aerial mobility due to how he used to propel himself with either his legs/arms by punching/kicking the air. Hell even Deku at 100% proved he is capable of doing this in his fight against Overhaul. Yeah he can't technically just float or hover but I feel float isn't doing to accomplish much accept serve as training wheels for Deku while he is still handicapped to 20% for One-For-All. 

Part of me feels that Horikoshi is setting up the quirks for Deku to be relatively weak overall but allow Deku's ingenuity to serve as a critical factor to their overpoweredness. Clearest example of this is Luffy from One Piece. In most fantasy super power world's luffy's rubber power is honestly quite weak, its Luffy's creativity that fuels the possibility of it being incredibly overpowered.  Maybe Hori is trying to taper Deku's overpoweredness this way so it feels less... broken? that he gets all of them?"
OnePiece,ff3t1f0,t1_ff3sel1,1579548226.0,"Im not the one conflating the entirety of a persons political view as chapo trap house the moment a person vocalizes they dont like the cops. Theres a lot of reasons to hate the cops coming from all parts of the political spectrum both conservative and liberals. Example: a lot of conservatives dont like law enforcements stricter enactment of  gun control legislation which subsequently have them taking measures to remove guns from homes. Liberals dont like cops because they are being used as a tool for oppression of minority communities.  Both sides have people who believe cops are corrupt for different reasons. So i think the one being pretty fucking stupid is you. 

Antigovt can mean a lot of things including anti-cop.  Im just saying why you are surprised that people here would be suspicious of them when the entire subreddit is filled with people who are taught from a young age to question authority figures.

Also the person questioned cops moral compass, not go on a rant to go and murder cops. I feel the one more inclined to advocate for violence is yourself."

The term is correctly being applied to indicate modern day far-right nationalist movements because they are very much echoing the beginning elements of the 20th century European fascist movements. 

The nazis didnt start off murdering jewish people. They began as a hyper nationalist movement with strong racist undertones hyper focused on their economy. They were also more than happy to bend the rules in their favor and cry foul when someone rightfully calls them out on their behavior. They also loved to point to “other” people as the enemy. They are also intrinsically tied themselves to capitalistic interests as allies. Wonder why that all sounds so familiar?  Because current right wing movements are literally running in parallel.
