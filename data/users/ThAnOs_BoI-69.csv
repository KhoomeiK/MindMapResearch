At the end of the day the woman took the risk and now has to deal with the consequences, you should not have insufficiently protected sex unless you can deal with these consequences, factors such as rape are less common than you may think and are the reason for less than 5% of all abortions. I don't say these things because I disrespect women I say this because I care about babies and I find it disturbing that people treat unborn and inconvenient babies like garbage."

The only place to draw the line is conception."
