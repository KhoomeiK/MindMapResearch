DoggyDNA,fezxhzf,t1_few2w3u,1579462975.0,"You can be a responsible breeder without adhering to breed standards. In fact, many breed standards can be argued to be irresponsible with respect to the health of the dog (see: brachycephalic breeds). I'd argue responsibility just means ensuring you're breeding healthy dogs free of genetic conditions by thoroughly testing the parents, lining up buyers beforehand so every puppy has a home, and requesting to take back dogs if the buyer can no longer keep them."

DnD,feaecuf,t1_fea5tqm,1578947623.0,"Mercer has created a ""campaign setting"" - basically he has been world building a planet called Exandria, with a few different continents. One of those continents is Wildemount, which is where the current Critical Role game is taking place and is what this book is about. 

World building typically involves creating a fictional world and all its aspects - maps, terrain details, political borders, kingdoms/empires, history, deities, native species and races, etc. In Mercer's case, he has drawn from a lot of pre-existing D&D material (monsters, a pantheon of gods, the magic system) but has also created his own fictional political powers, major historical figures, and written his own history for the world. 

This book is an official D&D book and a guide to Mercer's fictional continent of Wildemount. In it, he would describe the inner workings of that setting - the land, maps, terrain, climate, history, major figures, gods, humanoid races, beasts and monsters, civilizations, kingdoms, empires, dynasties, etc. - so that anyone can run a game in his world."
OverwatchTMZ,fdkhc7k,t1_fdk4qx1,1578503889.0,"There's actually a thing that discusses how this happens, called the [Peter principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle). Basically, the people who are good/competent at their jobs are the first to be promoted. These people keep getting promoted until they are no longer good/competent at their jobs. Thus you end up with incompetent people at the top."

HumansBeingBros,fdappdy,t1_fdao6xb,1578248778.0,Kangaroos are native to Australia.. a native species =/= invasive species just because they have a large population. The definition of invasive species is that they are not native.

interestingasfuck,fd2rugr,t1_fd2nrgc,1578151042.0,"Yeah they aren't *that* rare - certainly not rare enough that I would automatically assume an orange cat is male like I would assume a tortie/calico is female.

99.97% chance a tortie/calico is female vs 80% chance an orange is male."
interestingasfuck,fd28xdn,t1_fd26slo,1578143539.0,"This is incorrect.

the gene for orange is on the X chromosome. It is codominant with non-orange (black/brown). Because male cats only have one X chromosome, they can only be either orange or non-orange, never both at the same time. Since females have two X chromosomes, they can get a copy of the orange, and a copy of the non-orange, which results in tortoiseshell/calico. They would need two copies of orange to be orange, or two copies of non-orange to be black/brown.

There is a 1 in ~~4000~~ 3000 chance of getting a male calico (caused by them receiving an extra X chromosome and also making them infertile).

There is a 1 in 5 chance of getting a female orange.

Also orange is not a “minority color” in cats, if you mean to say it’s recessive like red in dogs or humans. It’s equally as common as non-orange."

aww,fcoefb8,t1_fcobtw5,1577830232.0,"No. Cat's have extremely efficient kidneys, which is why their piss smells so bad. They are also adverse to drinking stagnant water that just sits in a bowl (stagnant water in the wild is dangerous). This is why cats tend to go for faucets a lot. So if they're not drinking enough water, they will end up developing problems. 

You feed them wet food or add water to dry kibble to help with this. You can also get a pet fountain for them to drink out of instead of a plain bowl. I got one for my cats recently and they love it, although one still likes to drink from the shower faucet whenever she can."
