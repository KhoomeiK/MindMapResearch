JustBootThings,ff6jw8a,t1_ff670m6,1579628771.0,Yeah I just brought it up to illustrate that we all have a different military experience. To one guy it was a 9 to 5 job. To others it  meant the battle of Fallujah.
JustBootThings,ff6jhq1,t1_ff66gk6,1579628525.0,"I never mentioned being special because I was a grunt. It was a decision I made willingly for various reasons. However, without a doubt it's a different experience than say being an admin Marine. The moments of sheer terror on deployment and the physical and mental exhaustion is only comparable to a few professions in the civilian world, and for that reason it is not and will never be ""just another job"" like a taco Bell clerk. Yeah I'm not a Marine anymore and don't even talk about it unless it comes up. I'm not hung up about it like you're assuming."
JustBootThings,ff5d09g,t1_ff5adnk,1579587802.0,Fair enough. Everyone's experience is different. The stuff I experienced as a grunt will impact me forever so it's I cannot agree with your statement. Of course none of this is an excuse to be a boot fuck.

PoliticalHumor,ff41c4k,t1_ff3wnst,1579553396.0,It's the truth here in the states also. Hunting and fishing licenses and other fees supply the majority of funds used to protect habitats and the conservation efforts of animals. It's all a controlled system.
PoliticalHumor,ff40lda,t1_ff3xpgy,1579552933.0,They already do. But fact is they get WAY more money if once in a while they sell an exotic animal tag for tens of thousands of dollars. Until a better system come it's kill one to save a thousand or everyone dies. It's an easy choice.
PoliticalHumor,ff40969,t1_ff3jxzx,1579552721.0,"It's not the only way but its currently the best way. All you fucks see cute animal and scream that trophy hunts should not exist and these people are horrible. Yet, YOU will never raise a finger or donate a single dollar to help the conservation effort. Even in the States hunting and fishing licenses and fees pay for most of our conservation efforts.

So social media can make memes about them? They aren't getting paid for it lol."

AskAnAmerican,fdivqwl,t1_fditla4,1578452130.0,That's what I'm think happened because of the fact that these where allegedly surface to surface missiles from Iran. These are waaaay more accurate than the usual ghetto rigged 107mm Soviet era rockets that always get launched at US bases during oif and oef. If they really wanted to hit us personnel they would have. If they where the Soviet rockets then it's luck if they hit anything.

todayilearned,fd3tc7y,t1_fd3s9ov,1578161450.0,Most Americans don't give a shit or follow any politics. They vote whatever party everyone they know votes. I say that's our education systems fault more than a moral issue. Someone from LA will vote blue while someone from Kansas will vote red. That doesn't make either morally superior.

funny,fcaw9ce,t1_fcao4dd,1577577855.0,Imo Season 1 doesn't seem as good because its based on the first two books which are a compilation of short stories. There was simply too much information to condense a short story per episode in season 1 and a lot of the key elements where trimmed. Season 2 will be based on actual novels which will have a continuous story which I assume is a lot easier to film.
