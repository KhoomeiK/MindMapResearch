pcmasterrace,ffehv6p,t1_ffehq5h,1579848628.0,But don't OLEDs have good response time? I just googled it up and it says on average its 0.1 ms
summonerschool,ff5e3fh,t3_erkbip,1579588989.0,Lol I used to level up abilities like that then forced myself to change. Now I use the ridge of my palm where the fat is to click CTRL and one of my four fingers to click on the ability I intend to level up. Its actually way better than having to reach over and click CTRL especially for players who have their pinky finger on Q.

buildapc,fepyjqi,t1_fepscp0,1579334702.0,Yea I'm pretty sure I have to just replace mine too
buildapc,fepyeur,t1_feps5k1,1579334587.0,"it's 500W and here are the specs


Ryzen 2600

Geil superluce 2666mhz 8GB 

MSI gaming pro carbon b350 

random PSU

Zotac GTX 1070 mini 

1TB WD HDD

Corsair Carbide 275r

everything was new when I bought it except for the graphics card which was used for a year.

but yea I really shouldn't have skimped on the PSU but I was really desperate back then. Won't make the same mistake again though."
buildapc,fepy2ni,t1_feps7dp,1579334457.0,"Yea I agree. But back then I was trying to squeeze every penny I could since I was 15.

buildapc,fellbcf,t1_fekasps,1579224906.0,"Wait what? I always thought left handed people were cool and different. Actually fun fact, I started out left handed in kindergarten but my teachers encouraged/forced me to use my right hand because if not, it would develop ""complications"" later in life. Currently I'm right handed but i can still perform tasks with my left hand slightly better than some righties though."
buildapc,fejz4i6,t1_fejo353,1579189129.0, then you're not left handed

buildapc,fe187f6,t3_enibyz,1578823628.0,I'd put my money on the 1080 Ti since 300$ is too good a deal to pass up especially for a brand new card.
buildapc,fe1838z,t1_fe023gh,1578823575.0,its brand new
buildapc,fe17x2n,t1_fe162b7,1578823505.0,"Could be but bottleneck considered, the 2080 ti should still come out on top which it doesn't in this case."

pcmasterrace,fdcy5ke,t3_ekde8f,1578287791.0,Back when i built my computer 8GB ram was the minimum amount of ram required for a long time but going into 2020 will i have to get 16GB to play the latest titles?  So far 8GB hasn't been giving me any trouble since i close everything in the background when playing games and even go so far as to shut any excess software running in the background with task manager (im weird like that).
pcmasterrace,fdcxvll,t1_fda4pxx,1578287547.0,is there a reason why he would require ram that is that fast? Asking because I used to research computers before 2017 and back then ram speed didn't really matter and higher speed ram kits were less bang for the buck.
pcmasterrace,fdcxnjz,t1_fdb2qgt,1578287352.0,"oh, if you want to get into some moba games League of Legends is great starter and this is coming from a person who absolutely despised moba games until his friends persuaded him to give it a shot."
tall,fd963gl,t1_fcwc9ns,1578228967.0,Wait what?! I thought by 16 you stop growing since the bone plates are fused?
teenagers,fcuf36o,t1_fcueb71,1577979422.0,ohh yeaa it's always good to know from experience and real life because recently I've been looking it up online and all websites stated that most boys stop growing by 16 but I didn't really wanna believe that because I've seen people who have grown past 16.
teenagers,fcubf5r,t1_fcuaci5,1577977051.0,I'm with you man

teenagers,fcu3rpw,t1_fcu3h1f,1577971751.0,Ahh well that blows but I guess height isn't everything and thanks for sharing anyway.
aww,fcu3kfq,t3_eivt3j,1577971558.0,"Well, with that context i wouldn't Aww at this"
teenagers,fcu33ad,t1_fcu2049,1577971085.0,well thats a relief to hear that at the very least its possible.
teenagers,fcu2z06,t1_fcu1zvy,1577970964.0,could be but I've recalled being taller than all my friends throughout childhood ever since I've known them at like 7 and at that age i could not have possibly hit puberty lol.
teenagers,fcu1rxl,t1_fcu1p0a,1577969704.0,I think they are pretty average tbh but my older generations are pretty short so that might be part of the reason.
teenagers,fcu1om0,t1_fcu1m5b,1577969605.0,damn that's a solid gain. since you're 16 aswell may I ask what's your height rn?
witcher,fcqeh6c,t3_eidsb1,1577884378.0,I just finished the game on deathmarch on my second playthrough! Seriously couldn't get enough this game i had to get right back into it after finishing the main game and the DLCS. I'm just really bummed out that we won't get to see our beloved characters again ever.

food,fcmc8mt,t3_ehmanl,1577770237.0,how do people bite into this? I always found these types of sandwiches/burgers a pain in the ass to eat. Either it doesn't fit in you mouth for a clean bite or you get a bite and everything just falls apart.

memes,fc7kes3,t1_fc7hh78,1577510270.0,actually i think if you're a well enough preserved corpse people in the far future might run some experiments and put you up on some museum as an ancient ancestor of the human race or something.
AskReddit,fbxcf8k,t3_eetf7i,1577179929.0,"When I was a kid, I was obsessed with fire and hot stuff that one day I decided to take a lit incense stick (those burning sticks that give out fragrant smoke) to poke holes in my dad's mattress cuz why not right? After burning a few holes in the sheets my dad came in and long story short, he slapped me and told me to never do that again. Back then I just agreed and went on with my day but after a few years I realised that I could've burned down my house and possibly part of my apartment that I was living in back then."
