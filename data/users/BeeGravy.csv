If you're pleasing yourself 5 times a day to depraved porn, you're not going to get off from a real experience, especially if your specific fetish or kink isnt being met.  

That's part of why I see the increasing prevalence of porn and sexualizing everything as an issue. People are having trouble with actual sexual relationships which means they have trouble just getting or maintaining any romantic relationship.  

When you can use your phone to view tens of thousands of videos of cumshot compilations, of unrealistic sexual scenarios with people who are done up to look perfect, your own experience is going to pale in comparison, and is actually damaging to your well being... when you see these perfect looking people (tall, jacked, huge dick, banging dozens if gorgeous women... or petite skinny women with huge tits, perfect makeup and hair, selling the experience like it's the best thing ever) going at it all the time, you're going to feel inferior in some ways, and upset you cant live out these fantasies.

There is literally no fool proof method of finding out the exact, real, rates of any sort of rape, attempted rape, false accusation, domestic violence.  

I dont think the male brain is more predisposed to rape than the female brain. I dont think there is a massive disparity between men trying to hurt others, or women hurting others, though methods may differ.  

You're taking my example if what happened to me, as me saying THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN EVERY SINGLE CASE! Not what I intended, i intended it as a generality. I think more people would side with a woman saying ""he was abusive"" than the man trying to deny the accusations, or even than a man accusing a woman of domestic violence or rape. There's still plenty of people that think men CANNOT be raped, unless its another man doing it.

Or instead of penetrating with dick, use your fingers in the come hither style motion, again thumb giving attention to clit.  

Those methods usually will work, but yes some women require super specific methods to actually get off, but If thata the case, it's on them to tell you and have the required tools necessary, or they can't get upset about it.  

Like imagine a guy being like ""sorry I cant have an orgasm or pleasure unless you have prepared me a club sandwich, have this specific toy, we do it in this position, with certain music playing"" and then getting upset when he cant cum.  

Though I have noticed the chick tends to get more upset than me if i cant cum, which makes me feel even worse. Luckily dont have that problem still because I'm off the meds that did that, and im single lol.

Women can be just as crazy as men, for every male rapist there is a female rapist or woman making false claims because of how easy it is to cause a ton of damage.  

My ex was physically abusive, when we finally broke up (due to her cheating, I was somehow more ok with being hit than being lied to) she told all our mutual friends that I was the abusive one, she preempted me telling anyone the truth (which I probably wouldnt have anyways) by switching it up so I was the bad guy, once they thought I was the abuser, nobody believes you when you say ""well it was actually the other way around"" especially because she was very small, and I was pretty big from just getting out of the Marines. The only ones that believed me were the ones that saw her get violent before. She even cut herself and when I took her to the hospital, the hospital staff intimated that I somehow did it. After I broke up with her, she called the cops twice, first timing saying I threatened to kill myself (I didnt, but for my firearms and firearm license taken away) second time because ""she didnt feel safe picking up her belongings"" from my house, so they escorted her thru my house.  

The only other time I dealt with cops was at a previous apt (same gf) a neighbor called the cops because my gf wouldnt stop screaming about something. Cops came, saw she was drunk and hysterical, talked to each of us separately, and basically said ""deal with it because she cant drive home drunk, and nobody committed any crime, but they better not get another call out there"" and from that point on she knew she could always get loud and crazy to get me to give in to whatever so cops wouldnt come and I wouldn't lose my apt lease.  

It's insane having to live thru that, and THEN have ppl think you're the bad guy, ruin your name or reputation, etc.  

These werent even rape allegations and I wanted her to pay the price for lying, or to end my own life because I was tired of all the BS (plus depressed anyways) by the end of the whole thing.   

People can be terrible to others, and it's so very easy for someone to convince others that you did something wrong when you didnt, especially if they simply want to hurt you and cause you pain and misery.   

I guess it varies wildly because my experience is that everyone treats women like pure little Angel's that can do no wrong and 100% believe everything they say, and that the man is automatically the bad guy who needs to be ruined."

unpopularopinion,fgprr4u,t1_fgpbrg4,1581010730.0,"I mean, I sort of see what you're saying, but it's not just that snacks are cheaper, its that they're tastier, you can buy pounds of fruit or vegetables for the same cost as a box of snack cakes. Problem is, people in general and especially fat ppl, aren't going to be satisfied by veggies or fruit, they *want* the cakes.  

And if you just cook for yourself, buying lean meat or chicken or fish is affordable, especially to people eating $10 value meals daily.

I believe VS is basically formed using quality human souls and it retains some of the personality or skills of the soul used and possibly of those it kills, a sort of soul trap.

depression,ffpryvf,t3_eu923d,1580103567.0,"The only breakthrough I ever had with trying for explain depression was when my dad ended up getting depression as a side effect from running out of medication, and he realized it was depression after the fact, while he was dealing with it, nobody knew if he was ok because he wasnt talking like himself and just stopped calling anybody to talk, did nothing for the entire time except sit there, said he had no motivation and everything felt like such a chore, nothing was fun, and he just didnt care.  

After realizing that was what depression feels like, and that's a daily battle for me, he was like ""holy shit, I feel so bad for you having to feel that way all the time, I had no idea, and I wouldnt wish that upon anybody""

A drug is a drug, it's a way to feel better and escape the shitiness of your life, or enhance activities. Weed is a plant, so is cocaine and opium and opium derivatives are processed plant, and psychedelics come in various natural forms too.

mildlyinteresting,ffmkyre,t1_ffldc1w,1580056082.0,"I can almost guarentee those numbers are taken out of context or just plain wrong. Maybe taken as a whole of the army, 18% or whatever used their weapons, well that makes sense when that's about the % that are actually infantry and would be the ones fighting.  

Maybe when you're sitting in your trench you're just trying to scare the other guy when you fire at him, but when you're over the top or on an actual battle, there is just no way they'd not try to kill the enemy, and shooting to injure is much more difficult and would still likely end up dead in trench warfare of WWI anyways.  

WWII was more pitched battles, nothing would have been accomplished if less than a quarter of the troops actually fired.  

I read On Killing as well, and I honestly think the guy is talking out of his ass, trying to make sense of the brutality inherent in warfare and how easy it is for men to flip the switch into kill mode.  

I dobt think silhouette targets make you more apt to kill, it does however get you used to aiming at a man shaped target versus a circle, but a top marksman using a traditional target is still going to be good at shooting in combat most likely, a lot if our top shooters were country boys who hunted.  

I dunno, you just aren't thinking about the enemies being good people and not wanting them dead, when they are actively trying their best to kill you. No, I didnt want to kill any innocent people, but if they want to take up arms and kill my friends and me, all bets are off.  

But, there isn't malicious intent or hatred, if I met a guy who fought in the insurgency who was just a misguided dude and not a fanatical jihadist, I would have no problem talking to him. There is a level of respect amongst those who share a battlefield. And yes, most times war is pointless and the men on the ground wouldnt be enemies by default, and probably have a great deal in common, but nothing is like the will to survive."

And no I'm not saying to hate all of any group of people, I'm simply saying you're allowed to point out BS, or not like BS aspecfs of other cultures or groups.

People seem to think that even when you can point to objectively bad customs and behavior, its somehow wrong to point it out. Marrying children is bad, and a culture that promotes that, is also bad in that regard. Do they all marry kids? No. But they are all a part of a group that thinks it's perfectly acceptable, which is bad."
