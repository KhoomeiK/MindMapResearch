I'm barely staying above level as far as money goes and because of my hobbies I see younger wealthier people enjoying themselves. I don't ever judge myself based on their achievements (I usually applaud it as it's always amazing!). But I can't help but shake the idea that if I started earlier or challenged myself to experience things earlier in life I would be in a better place mentally/physically because I would have...well experience.

I bought my BMW and it's a dream of mine. It's perfect what i wanted. But I know physically I'm not in the best shape to ""fully"" drive the thing like I used to drive in my younger years. The more money I get the more I have to invest into healthcare and medicine and basically things older people have to invest into. I also have to help my father, which goes into those things too.

When younger I would still deal with those issues but in a precautionary way. I know I can't change the past. But this is the biggest issue I have when people say that getting your life the way you want in a later year is the same as getting it when your older, I feel is misleading. Yes you can achieve the same goals, but it's the not same feeling and outcome you may have if you have done it while younger."
worldnews,ff409dg,t1_ff3wuwd,1579552724.0,"Me and another guy on Reddit were talking about a similar situation with socialized work. Your complaint was my argument against socialized work environment. I don't believe it 100% but to me the flaw is that money for the individual is a better motivation than money for the group. 

If paying the group, the total payout will be less because there is more to spread around. This is ideal for the company, as everyone is basically equal. Performance of the building is in the hands of the workers, and all benefits that come with that. But if one or two or three slack off, the other members have to pick up the slack if they want to better production.

If the individual gets the pay raise based on production, this will motivate the employees to work harder, as they will be rewarded. The slackers will not get the higher pay as they haven't earned it. But this means the responsibility is on the owners/boss to provided a verified and solid scale to pay out. This is usually the problem. Too many workers and no system in place to cover the pay increase for each worker."

SelfAwarewolves,fdpflkl,t1_fdpdr0a,1578627351.0,"I guess I did confuse to two as they are very similar. So I looked it up, and your right the industrial production would be government regulated by democratic voting, meaning the individual can still own stores. But I'm confused if that means that if it's not a government run industry (power/gas/etc). Can the owner pay the employees whatever they want or is it still run by socialism rules. If that is the case then my argument still stands as  everyone would in the workplace would be equal, meaning creativity would be slower after a specific performance is obtained. But if the owner can pay employees whatever they want (obviously within living factors), then I see growth a more common event because people would be inspired by monetary gains (to buy, presents and better homes), than production for the company and a whole.

I think at humans core we are selfish to a degree as it is a passed on survival trait. New stores and things would pop up to be different (customization, and gifts and such). But, as far as the store company goes, I think creativity and innovation would slow down with more employees it gets.

I guess to simplify my argument is that creation needs a physical value more than a emotional one. The higher the value the opportunity for creation occurs. When everyone is getting paid the same, and there will be little profit for the individual there will be less likely to create or make a difference.

SelfAwarewolves,fdpaphh,t1_fdnv367,1578623949.0,"That is true... I wonder how custom shops would work in a socialist society.  The way I've seen it, is that without the incentive of extra pay difference  to set themselves apart, their would be less reason do change if it's already working.

If a new cheaper way of doing things is found, someone will always get laid off, however at least with socialism the government/society will cover that loss, vs capitalism the individual will have to prepare to cover that loss. My understanding (and i know it's a base level), of socialism is that it's suppose to spread the worth of the company and society equally to ensure growth for everyone. Meaning that, You still profit some way from those employees who are still producing otherwise, we go back to scenario 1 of being laid off. So the profits would benefit everyone, meaning the employees and the employee both see growth, mind you not as much as a capitalist situation, but overall growth should be the goal not individual growth."

This one time a guy in a litter turbo diesel tried to race a mustang and I guess fucked up so bad he ended up falling over. It was embarrassing to see a cop car block the road for a clean white lifted f150 with $20k in suspension work and LED lights laying on the ground like a crippled horse.
todayilearned,fc65vp0,t1_fc605hm,1577472981.0,"Similar story, was looking for a sporty lux car that was practical for broken Indiana roads. We get all seasons here so was looking at either a Lexus is250 AWD or Audi s5 Quattro. The Lexus was too small (I'm a bigger guy), and every Audi I went to see was on the shop for some reason, getting fixed or ""detailed"". While at one of the shops the guy showed me a BMW 135i convertible. Completely opposite of what I wanted, but I did want to test drive since I've never driven a bmw.

Fell in love with the damn handling and power. But it was practical. I walked away. I finally drove a s5, they are nice more luxury then sport imho, but great car. I ended up buying a BMW 135i coupe, love this stupid car and all the heartbreak it's bringing me. To top it off...its lowered by 2 inches, so will probably have to replace underbody soon thanks to our potholes. I STILL need a practical car."
todayilearned,fc651qw,t1_fc5gvzs,1577472438.0,"It's because (if I had to guess), the power output. Hondas even when dressed up usually don't have enough power to do much, unless your dumping tons of cash into it. If you dump that much cash into the car, you at least know how to evade police or don't want to race on the street unless it's for a reason (meets). G37 and now q50 are cheap and faster cars. I think the q50 is pushing over 300+ bhp for less than $15k. G37 are even cheaper, still with a lot of buyable bolt on mods."

But, it turns out the black consumer buys more toyotas. I assume because of reliability history and marketing on reliability.

Point being, what Bernie Sanders is saying can still hold true. Finding a job is easy finding a quality job may not be, since you can supplement income other ways than working another job. 

Quickie search %20+ of Americans are on some kind of government assistance.

31% of adults 18-24 live with their parents or other family members. This is obviously college age, so we don't know the percentage that will get a job to pay off student debt to move away from family. Still student debt is a bipartisan issue I would like to believe.

So there is a lot of factoring that has to be done to get a clear picture of everything going on. I know the economy is doing great but I feel that the younger generation and senior citizen generations are worried what it means for the future to the individual. 

Similar to how Amazon is a billion dollar company but you hear horror stories about how it's workers feel about the company (justified or not)."
