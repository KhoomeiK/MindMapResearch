OldSchoolCool,fegkjoh,t1_feex4n4,1579095588.0,"Because the US Federal Government was unwilling to enforce Federal desegregation laws until the mid 60s-early 70s.

Most of the desegregation laws and policies passed in late 1940s through early 50s, were narrowly written and had little federal enforcement mechanisms. 

Until the mid1960s, the defacto policy was for the government to respect individual states rights and only use the federal government in extreme cases. Hence why Eisenhower only sent federal troops to Alabama when it became apparent there would be a full blown riot over desegregation or why Kennedy only began to move on Civil Rights after a series of high profile race riots and killings in the south.

Also the south was an easier target, since most southern states were openly defiant and threatening about their racism. In the north, California, and mid-west, it was always more difficult since most local governments practiced equality on paper but were (and still are) highly discriminatory socially and behind closed doors.

President Johnson is the one whom really got the government involved in Civil Rights legislation and enforcement. President Nixon tied desegregation policy to federal funding. Basically both presidents set the condition of ""You keep open segregation, the federal government will sue you or withhold funding and grants from your state."" 

It took a few federal court cases and DoJ monitoring to drive home the point in the 1970s."
