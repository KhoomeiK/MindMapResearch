I have 2 families in my church, each have one daughter who are under the age of 3, one of them is even less than 1 years old. Both of them are very loud and annoying, I do have a big sensitivity about noises and odours, and because of those kids, I can't even focus on sermons (I am in ASD and because of it; I show my irritation a little bit without realizing my actions). Their families can't focus too. they constantly look at their kids, they also distract other people.

I think bringing these kids to cinema, church or to any other place where you should be quiet is just a huge disrespect to other people, even if they don't seem to be irritated. What if there is a person who is having a bad mood that day, or someone in autism spectrum? Should they bear your kid's noises and throwing her stuff around?"

It is apparent from your own behaviours towards your nation. Accept it or not. You are a self hatred Turk in Germany who wants to be accepted by Germans. That'd be cool, because as mainlanders, we don't want you. Gönül rahatlığıyla Alman olduğunu söyleyebilirsin.

Stop repearing yourself, idiot. Who cares if you were born there. You are just a degenerate Turk whom we don't accept as ours, so as I said, just don't bother calling yourself a Turk, just call yourself a German, better. Even tell all Turks there to not call themselves as Turk.

>Wow, you're just retarded and proving my point. Fuck your patriotism and get civilized. I don't get you. What the fuck is wrong with you...like seriously?!😂 

To be fair, you need to get civilised here, because even if you were born there, apparently your knowledge about Westerners are pretty feebleminded, because I know how Westerners behave and whatever I said in the first place is exactly how those Westerners you aspire to be act like.

Particularly, you also seem to have some identity crisis and self hatred. I guess you try too hard to not look like an ""inferior Turk"" or ""bad Easterner"" to your German friends. Let me give you a tip as a Turk whose friends are mostly foreigners. There is no way that you will be accepted as a ""Westerner"" by your friends but you can earn everyone's respect. That goes by behaving appropriately and  (relevant to our topic) ending your self hatred and having some national identity and self respect. You can't gain respect by trolling emotional (and now sensitive about national topics) Turkish people from mainland and then go complain about them to foreigners to show off how so called open minded you are. Know your nations faults but don't unnecessarily expose them to everyone, if you have a problem to talk about Turkey, go humanely talk to your Turkish compatriots who can actually help you, not Germans. People wouldn't take seriously those foreigners who don't have a respect for their own nation and always complain about it, you would just shit your own reputation as well as your own country's."
