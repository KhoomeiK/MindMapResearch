Personally, and in retrospect, I have come to the conclusion that Pretty Fly wasn't the end. Pretty Fly was a hit. The cover of obladi oblada was the end. It was the second single and it was the weakest track on the album.

But I guess that's what happens when you ditch your small indie label and join a major label.
