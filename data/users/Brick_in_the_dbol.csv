Feels like the following:

Physical:

Bruising inside the skin, burning joints, searing muscle pain, headaches for days, like I have a 500 pound wet blanket over me at all times trying to bring me down. 

Mental:

I feel like a failure daily. Not able to complete the most basic chores. I know it's not by choice, but damnit I can't do the things I used to and that weighs on you. As a man I rely on my wife (I love her too the end of the Galaxy and back again) but it's demasculinating to have her have to do basic things that I should be doing!"
