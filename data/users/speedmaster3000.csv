So really, you’re wasting money and suppressing a biological function that will ultimately ruin your life.

I used to get so upset with myself but  after while,  I started changing my thinking about it.... ummm obviously enjoying whatever I get engrossed with. And sometimes thats the fun part is watching and entertaining where your mind goes on your phone. Just because you don’t have a tangible piece of art or a journal entry or a clean room or something you can see, doesn’t mean it was a waste of time. If You’re enjoying yourself and you’re reading through reddit on your phone, that’s just as relaxing as another activity can be. We’ve got so much information and entertainment and ways to communicate right at our fingertips and I think sometimes people feel bad because “technology is the worst” but like bruhhhh..... I’ve landed on some cool shit while on my phone tweakin. Or sometimes I end up writing on my Phone  or I’ll look through Pinterest.... that’s a lot of art inspiration and ideas swirling in your brain that might be what you need to create something better than you would have that day. I find it not a waste of time if I’m  not bored or if I didn’t realize time had passed, I just try to enjoy what my brain wants and just go along for the ride without judging what I’m doing because why does it matter if something is a waste of time or not? You can learn if it was or you can be happy you weren’t gonna die of boredom.

Haha I hope all that makes sense.... :) much love !"

bipolar,fe7ivtf,t1_fe43cy4,1578915156.0,Thanks! Iâ€™m flattered that vibe shows through the bohemian style I was going for. All the art on the walls are paintings of mine and thereâ€™s still things that I wanna do but also open to any suggestions! :)
bipolar,fe5oo5f,t1_fdzx3pa,1578872293.0,"In my experience, Iâ€™ve only been seen as crazy or misunderstood so much that they write it off as moody and then intertwine who I am with traits that I embody during an episode. But Iâ€™ve learned itâ€™s about how you bring it up and making sure when i do, that I have the opportunity or ears to explain some of the things I find important about being bipolar. So I donâ€™t just blurt it out  but am patient in knowing the right time to share that information with others and in an intelligent, well-articulated, non-defensive way. So that required me to be able to understand that ignorance may be a result of lack of education or experience with bipolar people and I also found that I needed to accept that some people will never understand and thatâ€™s on them but I canâ€™t asssume they donâ€™t want to."
bipolar,fe4atp9,t3_ene9bv,1578857393.0,DUDE FUCKING BEST FRIEND THIS COWORKER IMMEDIATELY lol. Iâ€™ve never had someone respond so positively to being told about my bipolar disorder. This coworker is a rare gem that should be more a part of your life than just seeing them at work. Fucking I want to be their bestie now lol Iâ€™m so jealous
bipolar,fe0bmu3,t1_fdykkjc,1578808866.0,I even gave her these little notes she can hand me that Iâ€™ve written to myself so that she doesnâ€™t have to find a way to call me out of I havenâ€™t already during any mania. She really appreciated them. But Iâ€™m doing all I can to never make her feel as uncomfortable as she once did ... but sheâ€™s stuck in a mindset that really hurts me even though I understand her perspective :(
bipolar,fe0bill,t1_fdykkjc,1578808747.0,"Thanks for the response :) I actually do that exact thing and Iâ€™m open and when i can feel a mania onset or am self aware Iâ€™m mid manic episode, I tell her and Iâ€™m super open and itâ€™s just... I feel like I made her need therapy because of what Iâ€™ve put her through. She wonâ€™t even smoke weed once in a great while with me anymore because even though I go to bed when I feel any mania forming from it, she find every source of happiness or goofiness or silliness as delusional. And I told her Iâ€™d try to see what new meds are out there (as of 2018, I had tried EVERY medication Out there and had no choice to be unmedicated the last two years while hyper focusing on being self aware and I honestly have been the best me Iâ€™ve been my whole life, give or take an episode or two here and there. But I even stay aware from her when Iâ€™m manic to make it easier for her and I told her Iâ€™d find a new psychiatrist after leaving my fuck of a last one and I honestly donâ€™t want to be medicated not because Iâ€™m stubborn, but because I literally have been working so hard at finding a way to not put my
Body and mind through the bullshit of medication trials. My doctor is okay with it and said that heâ€™s impressed by the way Iâ€™m living my life and taking control of my disorder.... but if I do go back in medication because I love my fiancÃ©e, wouldnâ€™t it be fair that she find some way or some therapist to help her get over the trauma my first undiagnosed episode caused? Or is that selfish of me to ask?"

eating_disorders,fdckl18,t3_ek38kk,1578277219.0,"Keep going to therapy. Keep showing up. Keep believing you deserve better. Keep ignoring the bad thoughts and entertaining the good ones. What you think is what you become. Keep working towards the recovery your heart aches for. And whatever you do, donâ€™t give up .... because the sicker you get, the harder it is to get out and the less YOUâ€™LL be able to take yourself seriously, not other people. What matters more than anyone elseâ€™s perception of you is your own self-image. If you center your mindset around first changing/eliminating the fear of whether or not youâ€™ll being taken seriously, everything else will fall into place. If you donâ€™t focus on the root of the problem, youâ€™ll continue to cope through your eating disorder, projecting your self-worth and anxieties onto the food you eat instead of the feelings youâ€™re not approaching. Being honest with yourself about where youâ€™re at, what you feel, where your weaknesses lie and your strengths hide and acknowledge the
accomplishments you achieved along the way is the only way out of an ED. And there is no recovery without vulnerability, hard work and perseverance. Itâ€™s worth it though, trust me, it is. On the other side, you get to live a carefree life that doesnâ€™t leave you shackled to caring what others think about you and instead, you care about the only thing that has ever really mattered in the first place: what you think about yourself. Iâ€™ve been recovered for almost 5 years now, my ED lasted 8, I relapsed 3+ times and I was hospitalized twice. Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re going through this and Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re hurting. I believe in you and I know you can do this. <3"
