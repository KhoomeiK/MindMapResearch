 Even if Jesus was a real person the only broad support of any of his life events actually happening were his baptism and crucifixion, if they happened. Even then, the gospels are our main source of information about a Jesus, we don't even know who wrote them and they all contain non-trivial contradictions to the story. If they truly were the stories of the son of god, you'd think said god would help make sure the gospels were accurate, or said god really doesn't care if we know the true story or not. As far as the miracles go, there is no historical evidence other than the gospels. And again, we don't know who wrote them and they were written a generation or two after said events.

>Before that, people were mostly barbaric. 

Oh, ya, Christianity has totally absolved the world of barbarism wherever it went (read with heavy sarcasism). The Catholic Church is evidence in and of itself that barbarism has continued with Christianity. The cover up, protection, and denial of endless child rapes and abuse by leading members of the church, using the bible as moral cover for slavery and for the genocide of indigenous peoples across the globe with forced conversions and kidnapping across the Americas. Not to mention the many murders of witches and other innocents. The Crusades and wars sponsored by the Church, the Spanish Inquisition, and the stifling and muzzling of the advancement of knowledge and science, of healthcare innovation. And let's not forget the stupid refusal of the Catholic church to enforce or allow condoms in places of Africa to help curb the spread of HIV. Because every sperm is sacred and what we need more than anything else on earth on top of the current 7.8B people, is more people. People who will mostly be born in places that they are most likely to die in infancy via malnutrition and disease.

>Christianity beat the strongest force on Earth, the Roman Empire...

Christianity was used by the Roman Empire to unify a diverse empire and to be used as a justification of divine authority to the emperor. It's funny you say it was the strongest force on earth. Christianity became the state religion in 380 soon after, in 395, the empire divided partly due to the constant losses to the Germanic people north of the empire and the Hunnic invasions. I'm not saying the fall of the Roman Empire was because it became Christian but because of stronger forces. And just because an emperor converted to Christianity over a vision and imposed it on the empire doesn't mean that it conquered the empire ""with love while being persecuted."" And let's not forget that the Christianity practiced then is in no way the same religion practiced today.

>If you study Islamism, you'll find horrors, instead of the peace, charity and good spirit in Christendom.

If you study any religion you'll find horrors. And as I pointed out before, Christianity is far from being devoid of horrors, and to think so is so willfully ignorant that it hurts to think you believe that.

It says someone that my most religious insane relatives actively support here. The type that tell the teenage kids of parents killed by cancer that god gives cancer to those that deserve it. 

Gladu is also very much a parrot of Trump's ""fake news"" lines and that the liberal leftist media is lying to us."
CanadaPolitics,fdq1g6g,t1_fdozxbi,1578650141.0,"I think it's  because Canadians only see two different voting options and were generally happy with Trudeau and didn't find Scheer very appealing.

You're right, there is a lot of negative about Trudeau, and you don't need to misquote him on China either, you can just bring up SNC, JWR, lying about ER, etc. But I'm not here to defend Trudeau, nor do I want to.

Except, this is a post about Gladu, and still conservatives have such a hard on for Trudeau, they can't help but bring him up.

Instead of constantly criticizing the other side why don't you find good things why don't you take a page from Scheer, Harper, and Gladu's precious bible, and I paraphrase, remove the log from your own eye before telling someone to remove the splinter from theirs."
CanadaPolitics,fdoz8lu,t1_fdofght,1578616261.0,"What a out her position on thinking the church and state shouldn't have separation, she would love to make The CPC the GOP North in a religious sense. She has also publicly tweeted that Muslims are coming here to ""kill us all"".

At least Trudeau has addressed his blackface, it's not the scandal the CPC would love it to be. For the other misgivings of CPC leaders the ignore, deny, or double down on their deeds and hate."

It's disgusting that she tweeted that Muslims are coming here and they ""want to kill us all"", that on top of her praise for Trump in the past should hopefully open people's eyes to the type of disgusting person she is. 

Hopefully the Conservatives see it too, otherwise they will just flip from one unwelcome social conservative to another of a slightly different stripe."

I'm not picking sides here, I personally despise any Theocratic government (Iran and the States includes), but we don't know yet what happened.

If that's what they hope for the future make it known there are different phases and design the 'pedestal', as you call it, to be able to support towers instead of sending twice as much later to rebuild or reno an existing building.

As much as I want this hub to be built it is disappointing that the Region has scaled back on a golden opportunity to develop some core land into something that doesn't live up to its potential.
