uberdrivers,ffgi03a,t3_ethrz4,1579906676.0,Other than tuition for people that want to  use it there are no benefits to pro.   Trip info is a joke because you have to accept almost every see the info a couple minutes earlier
uberdrivers,ffghi2p,t1_ffgc3gl,1579906349.0,That’s right.  Uninsured/underinsured claims require the deductible.   I had a guy sideswipe me a while back and he hauled ass.  I had to pay $500 deductible
uberdrivers,ffgh4sv,t1_ffggh0s,1579906112.0,"It won’t.  Besides Cali, acceptance rate is tied to pro.  Meaning you have to accept almost everything to see the trip info"

“We aren’t ICs unless we can set our own rates”.  Welp,  give it time and Uber will roll this out to all of California and you’re gonna make even less.....unless of course Ab5 sticks to uber and you become employees. I’m not sure which is worse"

AskReddit,fffplgo,t1_fffojkr,1579889039.0,Sorry I don’t recall the name.   It shouldn’t  be hard to find though.  Just search WWII and look for one that focuses on japan and the bombs
AskReddit,fffock3,t1_fffmxr5,1579888272.0,There’s a doc on Netflix that had footage of stuff like that.   Fucking creeped me out.
uberdrivers,fffj7k5,t1_fffg3fv,1579885122.0,No.  But we don’t have a minimum pay either
uberdrivers,ffffv2p,t3_etchez,1579883058.0,Doesn’t nyc have a minimum hourly wage for drivers?   If that’s the case that’s why they’re still limiting the amount of drivers on the road
uberdrivers,ffff7w5,t1_fff9d64,1579882660.0,"Depends on the market.  Lyft pays exactly the same rates here.  Ftr, neither company gives a shit about drivers so that’s really a non issue."
uberdrivers,ffff378,t3_etb7dh,1579882576.0,"That ride would pay about $80 here.  I think Chicago driver rates are pretty comparable.   Typical driver pay is around 60% of the fare (sometimes more or less depending on uber’s math)

If you use the tip % in the app it will base it off the full price you paid and not just driver pay.   I’d be happy with 20-25% tip on a ride like this.   Any less than that and it’s just not worth it considering the chances of getting a fare all the way back are slim. 

Tipping in cash would go a long way with your driver as well.  I know it’s not always an option though."
IAmA,fffecn3,t1_fffa4x8,1579882110.0,"Mine is ~800. But it’s just me and the kid.  We don’t use the 3rd bedroom or the dining “room” so 500 sq ft is probably what we actually use.     So I’d have no problem living in a 400 sq ft play house.....but I bet I can’t afford one.  Lol. 

Having a basement is nice and I’m glad I chose this house over the other one I was looking at that is basically the same size.  All kinds of shit gets chucked down there :)"

uberdrivers,ff7mfpk,t1_ff7lpgf,1579653047.0,"No problem.  Just take your time and go for it.  

Tip before you get to the expense deduction part:   Separate your receipts into piles.    Cleaning supplies can be added up together and entered as 1 item. 

Figure 50% of your phone bill and deduct it as a single item.    You could raise this % if you legit use your phone more than 50% for rideshare but otherwise itâ€™s a good split.  

Got a music subscription that you listen to in the car?  Deduct a % of that too

Phone cords and shit like that if you bought them can be lumped together too. 

Did you buy any clothes or shoes specifically because you wanted to look nice or be more comfortable driving?   Itâ€™s deductible.   Donâ€™t go hog wild on it.  Nobody is going to believe all of you clothes were for Uber. 

Seat covers, dashcam, anything else for the car can be deducted too."
