uberdrivers,ff7mfpk,t1_ff7lpgf,1579653047.0,"No problem.  Just take your time and go for it.  

Tip before you get to the expense deduction part:   Separate your receipts into piles.    Cleaning supplies can be added up together and entered as 1 item. 

Figure 50% of your phone bill and deduct it as a single item.    You could raise this % if you legit use your phone more than 50% for rideshare but otherwise it’s a good split.  

Got a music subscription that you listen to in the car?  Deduct a % of that too

Phone cords and shit like that if you bought them can be lumped together too. 

Did you buy any clothes or shoes specifically because you wanted to look nice or be more comfortable driving?   It’s deductible.   Don’t go hog wild on it.  Nobody is going to believe all of you clothes were for Uber. 

Seat covers, dashcam, anything else for the car can be deducted too."
