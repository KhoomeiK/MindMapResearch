socialanxiety,fcx2ohw,t3_ej9sk8,1578048562.0,You're not! It might seem like youre alone but theres tons of people out there who can completely relate to you. As for advice... I don't know your situation so I cant really say but practicing healthy habits is always a good thing. Learn what things set you off and try to avoid those. Good progress can happen in time. Slow and steady wins the race
