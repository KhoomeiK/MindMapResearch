Cops enforce the law. Lawyers save your ass using these laws. Upon investigation by a court's order, if they find the wrong, cops then go get those wrongdoers. Without a court's notice, the cops will just listen to you, will probably tell you the same thing I wrote here and then ask you to go find a lawyer."
offmychest,ff9p6hg,t3_esfu9d,1579717795.0,"Not a lawyer. Straight away decline to pay any amount he is asking for. If he continues to demand and/or threaten you guys for it, use text messages as evidence. You have previous court order allowing you to leave without paying a dime. Get a lawyer. Sue his ass for extortion and harassment. Do not talk to him anymore unless you have your green light from your lawyer. Unless it's about declining to pay him."

Nope, not bad at all. The term 'virgin' also sets as a reference to who you are talking about. She was untouched yet she gave birth to the gift of God, hence the term 'virgin' hints the significance of her role in the building of the belief. If she hadn't given birth being a virgin, or if she was a known promiscuous individual who gave birth, she'd just be another Mary who lives down the street."

AskHR,fb72x37,t3_ebjdy8,1576571084.0,"I do not work with people with disabilities. I do not have coworkers with disabilities. I am not a doctor. I do not have any HR authority at my workplace.

I do have people with disabilities in my family.

Now with that out of the way, I don't understand how everyone is pointing in random directions totally forgetting the disability part. This behavior was purely triggered by their disability. Here's my mind:

Perspective 1 - Your coworker with the disability sounds like they may like you, hence the sudden aggressive approach towards your spouse. The shirt incident may not have even registered in their head, as something bad, or anything at all. They are trying to be friends with you, hence sharing lunch scenario later. (Please understand that this ""like"" feeling does not have to be the romanticized kind. Think of more like 'your bestfriend who started hanging out with their roommate all of a sudden' kinda situation)

Perspective 2 - Your coworker may have simply seen an unfamiliar face at the office (your spouse) all of a sudden and naturally reacted that way without even knowing what they are doing. Once they realised, they probably wanted to get past the whole thing and resume normal workplace interaction with you, hence sharing lunch scenario later.

I would suggest, do let HR know that this has happened, since your number one priority should be your own safety. However, you could mention that this may not be something that needs an action taken against. This is more the kind of info your coworker's doctor could use.

OR, if you do normally talk to them (or casually did, before the shirt thing at least), talk to them. Let them know what they did. Let them know how it made you feel. Let them know how it made your spouse feel. Do not be indirect. Do not be rude."
