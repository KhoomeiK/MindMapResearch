As you improve, turn the metronome down so that the click ""disappears"" when you're playing in the beat. If you're playing at the same time as a click, you shouldn't hear it. 

Then you can try timing a section with the click playing, and then play without the metronome and see if you finish at the right time.

If I could get an access token from .auth/me that worked on the API, I would be golden.  But my .auth/me request only gives an id token.  How do I exchange that id token for an access token that will work with my API?

I AM only handling things client-side, and unfortunately re-architecting the app to use a server is beyond what I'm able to tackle for now; I'm stretched pretty thin as it is.  With Easy Auth active for the web app, no one who is truly ""unauthorized"" will have access to the app anyway for now.  I'll look into getting a server into the mix in the near future.

I want to be sure I understand what you're suggesting I do.  The first way you suggest sounds exactly like what I want to do.  Users of my app should be authenticated through AAD, and I'll be managing in-app permissions in code from a SQL db.  If I'm understanding you correctly, you are saying I should turn on Managed Identity in the web app and let the Azure framework handle the token management between web app and API.  I also need Easy Auth turned on for both web app and API.  Is there anything else I need to turn on or alter before this will work?  


I turned on the managed identity piece for the Web App and I'm not getting 401 any more (VICTORY!), but am getting a CORS error, despite the web app origin existing in the CORS exceptions in the API.  Any clues here?"

Even when you're not doing all that stuff you mentioned, you're often talking with folks and ""soft working"", building the brand. If you haven't slept in three days and snap at someone, you never know who they might be connected to, or how many friends they have, or how much influence. As such, you generally need to be nice and friendly to everyone, all the time. You need to be ""on"" even when you're not at work. This is why so many movie stars and huge music stars work so hard to find some alone time...it's exhausting to be ""on"" 100% of the time. 

Until doing the job, I thought the stories of Brittany Spears having to cancel performances for ""exhaustion"" were BS code for rehab. Now I understand...she just wanted a little rest. I was nowhere close to that level of performance and media exposure, and it was still a really tough job.
