Meditation has a bad name. People completely misunderstand what it is you're doing and why.

We should rename it ""Stop distracting yourself and deal with your shit.""

Our massive backlog of unprocessed shit we carry around all our lives is the reason we have social anxiety.

Social anxiety isn't a brain defect. We are functioning perfectly. Social anxiety is learned. Something started us off and we've been teaching it to ourselves ever since.

How many memories do you have that if you focused on them right now they would give you anxiety, or make you cringe, or otherwise make you uncomfortable to remember them? That's your backlog of shit. That's your collection of lessons that has taught your body social anxiety.

You know how when you lie down to go to sleep at night that's when this stuff comes up? That's because bedtime is the only time you stop distracting yourself from all your shit. That's your nervous system's only time to process the massive backlog we've given it so that's when it tries to do it.

I systematically go through my queue of shit every day surrendering anything that gave me anxiety. Drawing attention to myself made me feel weird? It's fine. Embarrassed myself? That was fine. Tried to talk to a girl and made myself feel like a creep? That's totally fine. Got socially rejected somehow and feel super uncomfortable? Perfectly fine. I welcome all of the uncomfortable feelings and accept them. I let my nervous system know everything is fine. There is nothing I need to be afraid of. We don't need to store any of this fear. We can let it all go.

I don't care if you call this meditation, dealing with your shit, changing your perspective, or whatever else. It doesn't matter what you call it. It's critically important that you do it if you ever want to get better.

Everyone give it a try right now. Bring up a cringe memory, feel the feeling it gives you, and surrender to it. Imagine the worst possible scenario that could result from that. Your face is now on CNN because you're such a creep or whatever it is you are afraid of. Let your body know that that would be fine. You'd still have a bed, food, family, friends, a job, being embarrassed doesn't matter, and that you are safe.

And then do it to another memory like that, then another, and another. Then start triggering these fears in your life and surrendering them every day.

Sooner or later you are going to run out of things you are afraid of. You'll have trained them all out just like you trained them in."

Could you do that before?

This is why we never make progress with our social anxiety. We always want to skip to the end. You can't make friends if you can't talk to people. You can't talk to people if you can't look at them. You can't look at people if you can't stand being near them.

Of course interacting with people makes you irrationally uncomfortable. You haven't taught your body how to be near people, look at them, and make noise around them yet.

Stop trying to skip to the end. Put in the work at the difficulty level appropriate for where you are right now.

A lot of people with social anxiety seem autistic. It's because we are mortified of showing people our emotions and we act like we are incapable of emotionally connecting with people. We can, we just won't because it scares the shit out of us. We have emotions, we're just terrified of showing them.

You don't have autism, you have social anxiety, and you can beat it, but only if you stop trying to skip to the end and put in the work where you are.

Spend time being around people. Make eye contact with people. Greet people. Work up to brief conversations. Put in work every day. If right now that means sitting in a coffee shop sending people online messages that make you uncomfortable then that's what you need to do right now.

You're going to make it. If you consistently put in the work nothing can stop you. If you would like I can help you."
socialanxiety,ffdf2p1,t3_esxsmv,1579819532.0,"I used to have really bad driving anxiety like that. We feel like we don't have enough social value to take up space in the world. We feel like we aren't allowed to make other people wait. The feeling is really strong and we start making up wild stories about people getting out of their car and fighting us and other such nonsense to justify the feeling.

I changed jobs quite a few years ago and had to start driving into the city. It took time but every time I got that ""Oh god people are judging me for making them wait"" I accepted the feeling and let myself know it was fine. As I got better I started challenging this on purpose making opposing traffic slow down when making lefts, forcing my way into lanes I wanted, and making people behind me wait while I struggled through parallel parking.

If you keep showing your body you are allowed to take up space and make people wait their turn behind you eventually it learns that it's okay and the volume on this feeling gets lower and lower.

If you put your car somewhere inconvenient for people and don't move for a while they will go around you. They might be mad. They might honk. But they'll just drive around you and forget about you as soon as you aren't in their line of sight anymore. Trust me, I've seen them do it over and over and over again."

CodeBlocks skips this because it comes with a compiler. Pycharm actually comes with a virtual environment interpreter. You didn't actually need to do anything to start other than download pycharm.

Are you teaching it that the situation that triggers this feeling is safe or that it's dangerous?

This is hard but it's about as important as putting in the work in the first place.

I remember one of the first times this happened to me. I was lying down in the sun with my shirt off. Some kids coming home from school saw me. One of them started making a fuss about having to see some shirtless guy. It triggered the shit out of me. He was drawing attention to me and the whole group of kids was looking at me laughing at me judging me. The anxiety hit me super hard.

In the moment this idea popped into my head. What if I'm okay with this? What if the worst case scenario happened, had these kids told all the friends and their parents and whoever else did some creepy dude with sunbathing in the park? What would it matter? What if I was okay with that happening? What if I was okay with the feeling all of this gave me?

And then the weirdest thing that it ever happened to me up to that point happened. I would describe it as in that moment I stopped fighting the feeling of vulnerability. As I did that I stopped being afraid of it. This was still a situation where I had a bunch of attention of course and my nervous system was all fired up like I was having anxiety. But I wasn't afraid of it.

The next time I went out there and did that the usual feeling of being exposed to me, even harder actually. I tried to see if I could do that again. And somehow I did. I accepted the vulnerability of people seeing me. Accepted the worst case scenario. I accepted feeling my feelings without fighting them. And again in the fear and anxiety turned into this sensation of being okay with being vulnerable. 

I found the more I do this the more my body turns down the volume on the feeling.

So ask yourself this. When you put yourself in these situations and you're feeling anxiety because you're feeling vulnerable are you fighting the feeling or welcoming it and allowing it to be there?

That makes all the difference in the world.

What are you doing when you are challenging yourself? Are you trying to do everything right like normal people so that you have less anxiety? This is feeding the anxiety. You're telling your body you need it to enforce you to do things properly. You need to be okay with doing things wrong. 

Overcoming social anxiety is the process of teaching your body that it's okay to be seen being weird.

Stop trying to not be weird. Surrender to doing things wrong and being seen as odd. Welcome the feeling."

To directly answer your question, you engage your curiosity.

socialanxiety,few4zr5,t3_eqqq0t,1579405460.0,"Shame.

There's a lot of things I could rattle off, but it all goes back to that. We are so ashamed of ourselves so we feel we need to hide ourselves from society. Any moment we are exposed our every thought is about validation seeking to make sure people think we are worth more than we know we are.

It's also important to note that it's a feedback loop. The shame causes to avoid people, which causes us to both get worse at social interaction and more afraid of it which makes us worse still. Then we judge ourselves for being bad at it, giving us more shame, so we avoid people more, so we get more afraid of them... and we just keep doing this.

The reason we stay this bad once we've dug this hole is because we're so bad that we would have to reduce the difficulty of our exposure drastically but we won't. We try to do the hard ""normal"" things that blow our circuit breaker very rarely rather than putting in work every day.

I think ever case of social anxiety is composed of these three aspects. Somehow we become ashamed of something, then at some point we enter the feedback loop, and finally we get so bad that every day tasks are too hard to use to improve."

You need to practice being with people that cause you some tension and allow the silence and the feeling it gives you to just be there.

Another good way to practice is by making eye contact with strangers. Don't say anything, just smile at them. That's more targeted towards tension in general rather than specifically from silence but it will do you wonders."

This validation seeking behavior doesn't land how you wanted it to and you have trained your body to give you those vibes when you don't get the validation you are looking for. Your friends and family don't want your ""trying to fit in"" bullshit, they just want you.

You aren't going to fit in until you stop trying to fit in. You aren't going to feel like you fit in until you stop wanting it. This is despite the fact that you obviously already fit in. The only reason you think you don't is because you keep trying to give this feeling meaning.
