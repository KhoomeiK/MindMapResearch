It is scary to go from having that little nugget growing in your womb and then suddenly having to care for her every need once she's born. It's overwhelming, and what you're feeling is normal! I kept my baby in a bassinet by the bed until he was a couple months, then moved him into a pack & play in my room. Sometimes he sleeps in his crib, sometimes he's in the room with me, it depends on my comfort level on that given day. You're doing great, mama, we are here for you!"

At first I was skeptical but started doing research, thought about the pets I had over the years as a kid and why they died (kidney failure in two different cats years apart) and learned what they had been eating was horrible. 
I got an education on how the big brands made their food and was mortified. I definitely came around and started feeding a natural brand. My cat is 8 years old, has kitten energy and the most shiny coat. No illnesses. You can tell people about the holistic brands and they'll roll their eyes at you and get mad at the cost. But it really makes a huge difference. Not just in my cat but in all the doggos that came to the store with their owners. It's the real deal."

It takes trial and error to figure out how long the water needs to heat and how quickly your microwave heats up. But at 9 months now I know the water for a 6oz bottle takes 27 seconds, enough time for me to scoop the formula and grab it out as it beeps. I always double check the temp, every time.

I realized a lot of the guilt stemmed from lactation consultants pushing me and the overall opinion that breast is best and though I could make milk I was denying my child... Any bad thought I could have I did. But as time passed I realized I was actually enjoying feedings. Even though he wasn't latched to my breast and it wasn't breast milk, as I feed him a bottle to this day he looks into my eyes and touches my face, and we bond way more deeply than we ever could have as I cried and yelled trying to nurse him around the clock. Honestly if I were you I'd just ditch pumping all together, get those hours of your life back and feed formula. It has been the greatest relief with my sweet baby!"
beyondthebump,fegrhlg,t1_fegds3d,1579100829.0,"My baby lost the same amount of weight in the hospital after birth, and we had to take him in to doctor extra times to monitor his weight. It was concerning at first, but we too did the mixed feeding. Bfing quickly became too stressful and dysphoric for me, causing extreme depression and anxiety, so at 4-5 weeks I switched to just formula. Now at 9 months he's a total chunk, and I mean 21lbs huge! Hard to believe he was ever underweight. I'm not upset about nursing even though it had been my plan; it took me a little while to get over the guilt of not nursing, but when I saw my child thriving those bad feelings went away. I'm so thankful for a happy, healthy, fat baby!"
