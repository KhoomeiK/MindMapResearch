Kinda a friend of friend) a few and 100% support them in their sexual identity. But I'm not super comfortable dating one. You can't have children, sex is... complicated?, and just everything in that terms of that is weird. But if I met a trans person and we had similar interests and liked hanging out, becoming best friends or whatever is absolutely in no way off the table. You can be my friend regardless of your sexual identity. It's just the... bed stuff... that gets complicated and I'm not looking for."

He will sell an exotic weapon, a hunter armor piece, a warlock armor piece and a titan armor piece. The armor has bad stats but you'll want to buy it if you haven't gotten that piece yet.  Same for weapons except for stats (exotic weapons dont have random rolls). You can also buy an exotic engram which has a slightly different loot pool than world drops, but if it drops armor, it can have random rolls (stats and even different elemental affinities). You also might be able to buy bounties depending where you are progress wise."
