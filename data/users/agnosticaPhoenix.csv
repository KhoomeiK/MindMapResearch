PinkpillFeminism,ff3utmh,t1_fetzc2c,1579549330.0,"My female gaze might not be for everyone? but it's my religion. Mostly that feeling isn't transactional. And that loneliness isn't a thing. You can experience the richness of the ""illusion of feeling"" pretty much anywhere and as much as you want, but its not dependant on anything.  The world predominately tells you to put it away, to coerce you into dependence on possession and being possessed in relationships, material things, wanting. It can change your entire experience in life to be motivated by the illusion of emptiness, happiness, loneliness. If those are really dependant on 'what you possess', why do I feel so overflowing in solitude then? 

 Feeling is more fleeting and illusory... until you start basking in art, beauty, writing, or nature. I think it's hypocritical to expect anything to be feminine or masculine. Beauty does not get to be relished by one gender and not the other. (this part is just common sense) the feminine/ masculine were created/ enforced to manipulate power. More for people already culturally ushered towards it. Power, ""superior intelligence"" , strength, influence are earned/ cultivated by diversifying yourself and understanding the subtleties though, they aren't an inherent right. Sticking only to gender instills complacent weakness. ""the  strengths"" dont  just depend money and entitlement culturally administered only to some people. I think beauty ought to be universal, but it has nothing to do with make up, though I do like androgyney I don't believe in the extreme cultivating of beauty...im sure if I wanted to I could write 18 more paragraphs but nope  I'm done."

You are so stuck on the idea that people don't and cant have different temperaments, and reactions to being hAbitually mentally broken down.  I'm not responding because I ""need to feed my male ego"" I'm responding because i'm sick to death of this exact sort of brainwashing, you're doing, that we should CONTINUE to live in fear, hide and dissapear and live a shadow of an existence because of disgusting swine. I will stand here my entire life and until I'm blue in the face saying we should not. That is the difference between you and me, but it makes a huge difference in a person's life. Whether you're WILLING to become that way or not, for someone you hate with every cel in your body.  the difference between some people. You become fully aware that you can chose to be one or the other, so instead you become numb to being singled out and attacked in your family because nothing works, nothing ""nails you down properly"" it's like going to war. You don't have PTSD symptoms until it's over, but you also become completely numb to fighting, to being hurt, to being hated. 

 ive been in front that exact same disgusting voice, the exact same situation, but I would never have reacted that way then and even less now.

 I didn't know until later how  ruined my mind was, how antisocial, numb, indifferent to human interaction I was. I sure as hell didn't care to be noticed, because I did not respect him. My father was also one of the biggest imbeciles if ever known. That is probably unrelated but Anyway I'm not here to have a ""past contest"" with you.

childfree,fe1a0d9,t3_enhsxg,1578824247.0,"I will buy your book! link? I'm exactly like you, but my relatives with babies aren't anywhere near that rude\~! Er at least the sister and brother in law i see.. You're crazy to tell them straight up like that. I have before, but not much, i just know they wouldn't listen to me anyway. They are definitely good parents, but they're like a rare breed the kind of people who are supposed to be parents. They thoroughly enjoy every minuscule second of it. edit: dang.. its in Spanish. when do you think it will be translated? I actually really want a book like that, its everything I believe in. Thank god the birthrates are plummeting everywhere though right? We're doing something right."

I'm 33 and Really happy either way but, you have to be out of your mind to give up all that peace for relationshit and chaos."
reptiles,fdu5pgg,t1_fdo2567,1578728023.0,That is awesome for you. I on the other hand... If it were mine it would probably escape and kill me. All of my reptiles escape so I cant keep them anymore! :( I LOVE them. Stay safe.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fdsvtrp,t1_fdscvh3,1578708595.0,"I always suspected it but back then NOBODY in school questioned it. Never ever. So I never got much feedback about it, and personally may have loathed it but I never said a thing I feared the consequences. I left them alone and they left me alone so I guess there was one good thing. :/?? In my twenties I became vocal about everything"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fdsabqv,t3_emruua,1578698002.0,"I have felt this way since I was 16 or so. I remember growing up and watching what girls put up with in high school. (Plus Other experiences with individuals) and mostly.. from the very beginning wondering why they bother. Trying not to look too smart,  dry negative drama, or just tiresome effort to fit into this emotionless, hyper sexual void. It wasn't ALL like that, no, but I'd say 60% of my school took that void culture up in some way. The impression I got from the guys was what you described in real life...it infected everything and guys/ AND girls personalities.  Call me a puritan, but I actually wasnt, just wanted to enjoy my life (my home life was TOO stressful I didn't want anymore.)  eversince I was 8 I could remember wanting to do things  with one or two other persons.. make crafts or collages and just stay away from something nauseating, i couldn't understand what. Later on I saw misery and they all pretended to like it. I only had a couple really good friends.
 
I actually don't care whether I get in a relationship or not, I love my freedom. Either way I could be happy but less likely to be happy in a relationship probably. I had a few in high school and college. Mostly i remember it being a ton of work. All I'm stuck wondering is ... How can I be the only one like this? HOW???? I guess I'll never understand."
