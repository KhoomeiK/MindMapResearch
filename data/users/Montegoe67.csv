funny,ff88uco,t1_ff86nkf,1579669381.0,"I used to stress about that kind of shit all the time. I don’t feel like I got my life together until I was 32. Before that I bounced from job to job, failure at love, failure at life. Then for some unknown reason everything just seemed to click all at once. That was 20 years ago and I recently celebrated my 20th wedding anniversary and am going strong. I’ve got my dream job nearly 20 years now and we’re set up nicely for retirement. We travel frequently and enjoy ourselves immensely. Our familial relationships could be a bit better or closer than they are, but it is what it is and we’ve all got opinions, amiright?

Sorry. I wasn’t trying to make it about me nor am I trying to be preachy. Just sending you some much needed love from someone who has been there. It sucks right now. It may not always be so. You got this."

That’s not to mean she is your “meant to be”, just that you’ll figure that out in time and all of this that seems so much to carry at the moment will make sense. It’s all part of getting you to where you’re meant to be. It’s easy to get caught up in where you think you should be at a certain age but seriously who gives a fuck? It’s your life. Live it how you want at your pace."
AskReddit,ff760xq,t3_erx6df,1579641818.0,"I've stopped playing WoW for quite a while now, but back in the day I was part of a raiding guild that was co-led by a couple that was living together. They were kind of engaged and it was not unlike them to air their personal issues in front of the entire guild during a raid. Each would try to get the officers and guild members to pick a side during one of their arguments. It happened frequently enough that you could flip a coin to determine whether or not a raid would end with the two of them screaming at each other on open mic...let's not forget that there were in the same room physically....no...they needed to make it public and have their personal life unfold in front of the rest of the guild.

Most nights would be them bickering at each other but one night stands out. I can't remember the exact catalyst, but I think it had to do with her finding out he had been maintaining an online dating profile most of the time they were together. Not that he had an old account that he stopped using when they became 'serious' about their relationship, but one he was actively using the entire time they were dating, somehow she found it and realized it was still being utilized.

The way this played out was in front of the rest of us (not by choice) and resulted in much yelling and screaming from each of them. It didn't matter how many of us told them maybe it was best if they left the raid and worked out their issue(s) with each other offline, no...they both just went for broke while the rest of us either left the channel or listened in silence and shock. 

The climax of that night was when she got angry enough to strangle him using the cord from his own headset. We could hear the whole thing and it was equal parts stupid, scary, and hilarious. It's probably a good thing headsets are mostly wireless now."

She hates slugs more than any other insect and is not above immediately salting any poor unfortunate slug trying to meander it's way across our patio at home. They don't bother me and I think it's kind of cruel for her to salt them, but it's not a hill I want to die on so it is what it is.

Hoh is full of banana slugs so it was not a pleasant time for her. It was also unpleasant for me to be reminded frequently about how I forgot the bag that contained her 'real' shoes while we traversed as much of the main path as we could while she dodged puddles and slugs."

The birds are very keen to what is going on outside of the house and always seemed to start their chatter a good 20-30 seconds before any of our dogs would even think about barking at some unknown noise outside. The dogs seem to get lazy once they figure out the birds are much better at hearing or recognizing an incoming delivery truck. I get why...they can only make it in the wild if they can stay safe. 

If the birds started, the dogs took that as a cue to begin barking, then the doorbell rings. Every time."

EggsInc,feawaaq,t3_eo1htg,1578952834.0,"It happened to me too. I e-mailed Auxbrain support and got a near immediate response about an update that should fix the problem. I scanned for a pending update and sure enough, there it was. Installed it and it fixed the issue.

E-mailed support a second time about this ""glitch/anomaly/issue/whatever"" and its potential impact on our co-ops success if members were booted (or left) erroneously and got no response.

I am not beating the anti-Auxbrain drum, but this does kind of suck to have an update pushed in the middle of a contract. I was one of the top players in the co-op and can't imagine how defeated I or my co-op group would have been had I left the contract thinking it had bugged out. 

Given that we're not talking about massive rewards on this one I think the dev should just award everyone who has participated to-date with all 3 tiers of rewards. For the record, my co-op did make it in the end, so this isn't salty tears on my part for not getting the goodies, but I certainly understand people getting frustrated over stuff like this."

aww,fcldhz9,t3_ehq31a,1577745282.0,"It can be hard to tell, honestly. While instinct tells you that the cat would normally tear that bird apart, it all depends on the history here. 

We had a jenday conure years ago not much bugger than the bird in the video. About the same height, but maybe a little thicker. We also had 2 cats. We would never put Merlin (conure) in harms way, but he was fearless and after a few interactions with a beak, both cats lost interest in killing him as they seemed to understand he could hurt back. 

The lessons learned came when the cats might be lounging near Merlin’s cage as cats do. An unfortunately laid tail that rests too close to the cage and an always curious conure is gonna have a taste. They cats quickly learned to respect the beak. 

One cat steered clear of Merlin at all costs. The other cat was so chill, that he and Merlin would cuddle. More like Merlin would climb onto the cat and sort of nest on his back. We think the cat liked the bird feet on its back because he’d often purr. 

I think overall it’s not a good idea to have them in such close proximity, but it’s also possible these two have gotten over their predator v prey nature."

OldSchoolCool,fcg62q8,t1_fcfklc5,1577636837.0,"I made a claim using the coverage a credit card supplied to reimburse damage for a rental car and it went okay even though it took almost 2 months of requests for additional information before it got resolved. The rental car was parked in 118 degree heat and it’s windshield cracked. After arguing with the guy at Alamo for what seemed like an eternity and my card getting charged 250 for a deductible, I decided to try using the coverage from the credit card (Alaska Airlines CC). 

The 3rd party company handling the claim wanted copies of every scrap of paper and wanted them submitted in perfect order. Any deviation gave them reason to delay. When I worked out the issue regarding the delay, they would ask for more copies or would seek something new like a copy of my credit card statement to prove I had been billed. It seemed like it would never end, and then it did! With them sending payment direct to Alamo and not reimbursing me even though it was clear I had already paid in full. That took another month to sort out, but it did get sorted and I did receive full reimbursement. 

Moral of the story is that in my case it worked out. It may work out for others too, but be prepared for them to attempt to poke holes in your effort. I imagine it’s by design to frustrate people into giving up or to have cause for rejection. Fortunately, taking a photo of docs with your phone and using that as an attachment works, but the rest of the process was not user friendly and I found it more frustrating than it should have been. 

I get there’s probably fraud in this industry and the downfall of that is a process packed to the brim with red tape.

At the end of the day, with much perseverance, I managed to get my 327 dollars back. I’m not sure if it’s more difficult if seeking larger amounts."
tifu,fc7fwfm,t3_egl886,1577506213.0,"I hadn’t spoken to my cousin for close to 40 years. Not since I was 11 or 12. Something like that. I adored her. She was 10 years older and she made such a fuss over me and my siblings that I never forgot her. My parents had issues of their own and moved us to Seattle from Los Angeles and cut ties with nearly all extended family. All drama was between them alone and did not involve the extended family, but I think they were too embarrassed to face them. 

So after nearly 40 years I try to track down the cousin. Manage to find a few possible phone numbers from google after making an educated guess at her married name. I text all of them with a safe amount of information in an attempt to make sure I am talking to my cousin and not get myself catfished. Get a response from someone that claims to be her son and I get her number. I text it and after we both jockey with details so we can both confirm we are who we say we are, it’s her! We spend the next 4 hours on the phone catching up. I’ve been back to southern Cal twice since summer and have visited her both times multiple times. 

In our catching up I find out I actually have another aunt. My paternal grandmother had a bit of a reputation, and it was not unheard of for my father to crack wise about with quips along the lines of “I had a different dad every night” or “you don’t know what having a mother is like when you’re raised by aunt-mom”. So basically a rough childhood smack in the middle of the Great Depression. She had gotten pregnant out of wedlock at 16 and gave the baby girl up for adoption. No one in my “known” family knew of this until my grandmother was on her death bed. We were estranged from her and did know her well if at all so knew none of this. When she passed she revealed to her daughter (my aunt) that she had an older sister and she gave her the name of the family that adopted her. 

Through the magic of the internet my cousin finds her and determines she was adopted by a Mormon family in Utah and had seven children of her own. I have seven cousins I never knew about. My dad has a sister he never knew about and will never know about (he passed years ago). Were he alive today I am sure he’d have a few choice remarks to add to his mom list. We have made no effort to contact that part of the family. We are not sure they know whether or not their mother was adopted and do not feel it’s our place to make that known to them. 

Who knows...maybe someday one of us will end up with a test kit to 23andme and we’ll find out how many more of us are in the stew. 

Families are weird."
