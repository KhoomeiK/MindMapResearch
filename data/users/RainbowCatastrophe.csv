I'm no expert either and don't claim to be.  I only know from my experience with mentally disabled and troubled individuals that not everything they do is premeditated and people should stop acting like it.

I completely agree with you, saying he is crazy is a simplified version of saying he has issues which is what I was trying to say-- something in his brain chemistry (biology, disorder or trauma) likely made him more likely to do this, it definitely does not look premeditated.

I'm not trying to defend him in any way, I just wanted to throw it out there for anyone who hadn't seen the last thread for this that a lot of people were saying exactly what you're saying and that calling him an absolute piece of shit that doesn't deserve love is a little prejudice since nobody knows whether or not he's troubled or truly just a piece of shit."

I did not try to pass it off as wisdom, please let me know what exactly I said to imply that and I'll apologise that it came off wrong.

And I am open to questioning if the questioning is part of constructive discussion.  Saying things like ""you're stupid lol"" is not constructive.

Other people did say this and while I partially agree with their theory, my own is different but sheds less light on the issue.

And that's not justifying the actions, just reasoning as to what the motive was-- chemical biology plays a big role in everyday life and last time this video was posted, most of the discussion agreed that this seemed to be a heavy influence.

Personally I think there may be some undiagnosed history of abuse or mental disorder that is causing a significant imbalance amplified by puberty.  I experienced similar as a kid thanks to my disorder and still take medicine to this day to keep me from overreacting to things.

First off, if you've been coming to this beach for years with your body board, maybe at some point you would have thought to bring a towel to put it on instead of inconveniencing people trying to throw away their shit?

Also, why the fuck is he so quick to aggression?  Like goddamn dude, saying the life guard has no chill but you're so ready to cuss and insult him.  Maybe wash off your ego along with the board mate.

This lifeguard isn't power-tripping, he's trying to get it in the little shits head that there is a good damn reason he can't have his board on top of the trash can-- people will fucking litter if they can't throw their shit away.  Most beaches I've been to have those cans pretty far spread, so if this ones not accessible then it will be a good walk to find another.
