YouTubers/streamers/social media directors do their job because they get paid, and some even get paid very well.

But it isn't work, per se. It IS a job, but there is a difference between the two.

Work is done towards and end. The goal is always to make money, but the idea is that you're working on something (a plate of food, a building, a spreadsheet, etc.) That has a tangible ending point. The work finishes. 

But these online people have jobs. They work whenever they want, and short of restricting themselves of bathrooms and food (which is optional), it isn't physically taxing in any way, and doesn't actually accomplish anything. They didn't make anything, they just played and talked. Nothing was gained but the most rudimentary form of entertainment by the viewers.

End rant."

AskReddit,fex8o9w,t3_eqies2,1579426915.0,"Okay I have three so bear with me.

In grade 8, I asked out a girl for the first time. I was wearing red nylon pants, a white long sleeve t-shirt and a blue checked shirt sleeve button-up over top.
I went home that day, wore my clothes until bed, etc. 
When I woke up, the clothes were gone. They never turned up, any piece of that outfit.  

The second and third happened within a two week span of each other and are both a good deal creepier.

I was seeing this girl and we would go out for walks at night in a sort of naturey area near my place.  This was the summer that pokemon GO launched, so I was on my phone catching pokemon while we walked.  After a long while of walking in the dark, she eventually gave in to my insistence on going back, as we were going to pass a bridge soon and often drifters live under bridges in my area.  Walking back, we both got overcome with a sense of dread and decided to start running. We made it to the point that was about 60 seconds from the entrance to the area, at the bottom of a steep path.  It was about 30 degrees Celsius out, so a very hot summer night, and we were out of breath, trudging up the hill using our phone flashlights for light when a figure loomed in the darkness ahead of us.  To me, he appeared as an old man in a heavy black peacoat down to his ankles.  Although strangely, right after the encounter and ever since I can't recall a single detail of his physicality apart from a sense that he was old.  As he shuffled through the darkness towards us and walked past us, we kept our phone flashlights towards him and at the ground, and he stopped in his tracks and watched us pass. As we passed he said, staring at us, in his much too warm coat ""lovely night for a walk, isn't it? You seem like such a nice couple"" and we got freaked out and ran off.  There was just something so menacing about his presence I'll never forget it. And there was heavy foliage above the path, and no lights so prior to our phone flashlights he had been walking a small forest path, in winter clothing, and in pitch black darkness.  I'm convinced he may have been a supernatural entity.

The third event was a mere two weeks later, in the company of this same girl. We were visiting my family in the countryside, lying on a boathouse roof on a summer night staring at the stars. When we both noticed one star travelling across the sky in a curving, arcing wavy path, and another seemingly following it.  It's possible it may have been aircraft of some sort, but to me they seemed as though they must have been going incredibly fast, and so far away they looked like distant, dim stars.  Listened for aircraft noises and didn't hear any.

The person I had both of those encounters with has since told me they have schizoid tendencies, but in both sets or circumstances we both saw and reacted to the anomaly.  I seriously think there might be something about ""crazy"" people that attracts unexplainable events, and they just happen to usually be alone when they happen."
AskReddit,fex53r7,t3_eqouu3,1579424543.0,"Mine's wierd as fuck but I'm a big fan of immortal technique, and he has this one song where he features another artist who says the words ""sole survivor, 2nd nature"" that I always just thought sounded sweet.

Fallout 4 had just been announced and I was interested in participating in the discussion around that here on reddit.

So SoleSurvivor2ndNature was to be my new username, fitting with my tastes in music and videogames.

But it was too long and now I probably seem like a nazi or some shit. Self conscious about it but nobody has ever ASKED if I'm a nazi so I think maybe I'm just being paranoid."

I've never had a bond or membership, and have no intention of spending money or sinking that level of time into OSRS. 

 For me, it's just more fun to play RS with my significant other while we text than just sit there texting idly.

I can only imagine she was one of very few people to receive one of those, as being born in the last 5 or so years of a century is a prerequisite, on top of living to 100+, and having your birth recorded in a British colony or in Britain proper.
