movies,ff3iusj,t1_ff2khol,1579541977.0,"It's so damn idiotic how licensing is handled when it comes to subtitles and dubs.   
I'm in Sweden but prefer to use English subtitles when I watch something, especially if it's in English to begin with and I usually have them on just to be sure that I don't miss any quiet dialogue.  
But HBO Nordic (which is the only legal way to watch HBO shows in Sweden) [doesn't have the licensing rights to the English subtitles](https://twitter.com/hbonordic/status/454508746106892288), for their own shows, which are originally in English, and which have English subtitles in the US!  
And the other week I wanted to watch *Låt den rätte komma in (Let the Right One In)* on Netflix with my significant other (who doesn't speak Swedish), but it turns out that Netflix doesn't have the English subtitles for that either so we ended up watching an illegal stream of it instead.

>Although emotional abuse is not as clearly defined in the law as other forms of maltreatment, it is generally recognized as a pattern of behavior by a caretaker that impairs a child's emotional and/or psychological development.  This may include constant criticism, threats, rejection, intimidation or humiliation, acts intended to produce fear or guilt, withholding of love and support, and isolation.  Witnessing of domestic violence also falls within the scope of emotional abuse.  Reasonable suspicion of emotional abuse that **must** be reported often results from verbal disclosures or direct observation and involves any person willfully causing or permitting any child to suffer unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or endangering the child’s person or health (Penal Code 11165.3).

Also you clearly don't know how CPS and similar agencies work. Here in Sweden if you work at a hospital or a school and you as little as suspect that a child is in an abusive household then you are required by law to report it, even if it ends up being nothing major. Because if you report it and it turns out that they've been reported in the past for similar concerns then that increases the likelihood of the issue getting investigated."
