MurderedByWords,ffcdov0,t1_ffc5xgi,1579797225.0,"Saying that atheist don't agree with ""BS"" and about having "" imaginary friend ""  is definitely shaming religious people ."
MurderedByWords,ffc5qo7,t1_ffbria4,1579792159.0,I mean openly shaming religious people is not a trait of atheists.
MurderedByWords,ffb9fmp,t1_ffb330r,1579756080.0,That was directed to the guy above me . You were being reasonable.
DrawForMe,ffb3xgh,t3_esm0fi,1579751153.0,This looks cool
MurderedByWords,ffb1g1l,t1_ff9wscp,1579749414.0,That's called anti-theist . Atheists are people who don't believe in God and mind their own business .
MurderedByWords,ffb18ta,t1_ffa885b,1579749282.0,You call that sarcastic ? It's just preacher vs anti-theist talking .
MurderedByWords,ffauwa0,t1_ff9yet3,1579745050.0,So atheists are doing scientific discoveries during those days?
AskReddit,ff9ty31,t1_ff9t6yr,1579721222.0,If this is sarcastic I'm an idiot . Indian soap is like drama shows . Like 80% is annoying . 20% get a pass.

AskReddit,ff97xq0,t1_ff92zxw,1579706924.0,I misread but people misunderstood my response that ambivert means being with interesting people and introvert means being with boring people.
AskReddit,ff90u1h,t1_ff8xp9k,1579701984.0,Everyone is misunderstanding me I think . I said you were an ambivert because you enjoy being alone and spending time with a particular group of friends . That's what i meant as ambivert .
beatbox,ff8tz9w,t3_esau9n,1579696005.0,Alem style?
AskReddit,ff8tu76,t1_ff8qpua,1579695858.0,Ambivert means kind of like an introvert who is comfortable with a particular group of friends .
AskReddit,ff8tqxx,t1_ff8qrtm,1579695767.0,By passion i atleast mean like watching tv series or gaming . Edit : i think you misunderstood me saying ambivert.  I meant that because ambivert is like an introvert but comfortable with a group of friends.
pokemon,ff8orh8,t3_es4x3a,1579689346.0,This is some good shit
AskReddit,ff8n7nl,t1_ff8it39,1579686988.0,True.  This thread is like filled with extroverts more than introverts and ambiverts .

manga,fexcqxd,t1_fewjonr,1579428771.0,Yamada kun ....  Kind of had unnecessary harem if you ask me . I don't remember the characters names but the girl who can control others with a kiss (1) and the junior girl (2) were the most unnecessary . (1) kinda fell again for mc after losing memory which left a bad taste when she got married to other guy who was loyal to her always . (2) was always in love with mc but after he rejected it felt like she didn't really love the guy she married . And the before president who was in love with white hair girl didn't really even have an ending considering he was still following her around and she still didnt forgive him . I don't remember about the girl who can see the future ? Was she in the harem too .

clevercomebacks,fenad19,t3_epxcgy,1579280422.0,"The response wasn't even in accordance to the article since the article didn't really downgrade white men but like presented it in way that the firefighters are selected on basis of Physical strength for which they said white men were suitable .

comics,fen3izw,t1_femr8ob,1579276172.0,Just type peloton ad and the only controversy is about the latest ad where the husband character gifts his fit wife a peloton bike .
