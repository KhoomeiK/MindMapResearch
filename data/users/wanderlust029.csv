JUSTNOMIL,ff3an7m,t1_ff31wvs,1579537490.0,"I’m not suggesting he should go into depth about his mental health, but certainly not lie about it, and talk about it in an age-appropriate way. You’re again making assumptions about how often MIL sees her grandchildren, you don’t know she doesn’t see them that often. If I were OP, it would make a difference to me if my children were having a medical emergency or crisis near home versus 2600 miles away - that seems callous to say it doesn’t make a difference. She also “clearly” isn’t a JY for coming over in the first place - that’s not an argument for JY or JN. I agree that there are other factors and reasons to consider, I really do. But you’re making just as many assumptions as the “overreacting” commenters are. Whether it helped them grieve or not doesn’t make it appropriate for MIL to do what she did, it showed poor judgment at best."
JUSTNOMIL,ff30k05,t1_ff2u8ae,1579530425.0,"You’re making just as many assumption here in defense of MIL as other commenters are in defense of OP. Read how many “maybes” you wrote. OP also states that letter was not a legal document. We don’t have all the necessary information to say whether this trip was necessary “therapy” or not, which frankly I find hard to believe wrangling four children through two five-hour flights could be considered therapeutic. If MIL herself is also experiencing acute grief, her judgment is also compromised. This was a huge breach of trust. Why not tell OP before the trip?"
JUSTNOMIL,ff2zx1d,t1_ff2kb0c,1579529896.0,"I’m sorry, I don’t buy this. You think a grandmother would think it’s *fun* to take four children, including an infant, on a five hour plane ride? I don’t care where they’re going, that’s a logistical nightmare. I could excuse it as ignorance if MIL spoke about *planning* a trip to San Diego, not realizing how far (and how much money!!!) that flight could be. It was not MIL’s place to make a decision to take children that far from their parent, even assuming it’s the same jurisdiction, which it wasn’t. She knew it could be difficult to get ahold of OP at his facility, what if there was a medical emergency? Also, your wording implies it would be shameful for OP to tell his children he was taking care of his mental health. Of course it’s going to be hard to talk about, but it’s something that should happen. An appropriate distraction is a trip to the local petting zoo, a movie, etc. Not a flight across an ocean without a parent’s knowledge or consent."
JUSTNOMIL,ff2yzg5,t1_ff2f32b,1579529100.0,"Yes, single parents travel with children, cool. *Grandparents* do not travel across an ocean with their *grand*children without the *parent’s* permission. That’s appalling."
muacjdiscussion,fewgb2m,t1_fevuaxa,1579410103.0,"Yeah I had thought so too. I think the people who were aware of the controversy just stayed away from the display or never brought it up. So I think she lost a good number of existing customers, but there seemed to be a lot of people who still wanted to be introduced to the brand or were loyal to it. And she just didn’t have a lot of exciting releases, honestly. The mascara, the newest eyeliners, and recent palettes have all flopped."
muacjdiscussion,fes7gh7,t1_felgl43,1579362180.0,"When I worked at Sephora, I was the only employee at my store who would not promote KVD. (It was a huge store, and most employees were PoC, but just shrugged off the controversy about her racism AND anti-vax stance). We were actively encouraged to promote her line because managers could get daily updates about how each brand was doing in the store, and KVD was down like 20-30%. I was able to intercept a lot of customers who were browsing her stuff out of curiosity, but a lot of customers who were loyal to her products did not want to be introduced to alternatives. Almost no one I spoke to was aware of the controversy surrounding her. One customer even told me, after I said it was a shame KVD was an anti-vaxxer and racist, that she just “didn’t want those Chinese chemicals in her makeup.”"

Huh, I didn’t think this was unusual. For me though, it’s generally due to wanting to save money more than being lazy."

Everything should go into a group text. She’s triangulating. I also suggest as much communication with MIL as possible is in text or email, or recorded phone calls so you have a record of her lies."
