Community Service is slavery to you? Man, you set the bar low. Here is why it isnt:

Community service is a recognized form of discipline within the USA (and many other palaces) The difference here is that its given as an optional form of discipline to help reduce the number of imprisoned inmates. If you do not want todo your community service, you have the free ability to NOT DO IT, you will instead face prison time or fines instead. 

Whereas in every single communist country ever, you are first imprisoned into a Gulag-like system. You are then threatened with violence until you do the work that you are being told to do, you are under nourished, beaten and quite likely to die if you dont do exactly as told .. even then .. you have a fairly high chance of death. This isnt isolated, this is well documented in ever single communist country ever .. even the little ones like Romania. 

Prisoners in the USA dont have it very well compared to the citizens here that have followed the law (and yes, some laws are unjust and need fixing) .. but .. Prisoners in the USA have it better then most of the middle class and below did in the USSR.

I highly recommend you read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn - The Gulag Archipelago. Its required reading for many Russian school children (so that they dont commit the horrors ther grandparents and parents did under Communism) and any good history teacher in North America would recommend it."

As for the bank. There are a lot of factors that go into an eviction, but if the tenant ""can't"" pay, then they will likely be evicted at some point. This is based on the idea that the tenant and bank entered into a mutual agreement and one of the parties (in this case the tenant) is violating the terms of the agreement.
