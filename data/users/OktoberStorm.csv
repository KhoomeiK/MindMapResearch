witcher,ff8yeh1,t1_ff8x4dg,1579700046.0,"This comment made me think. Yes, it's silly that some people make long winded speeches out of a bagatelle that is reddit gold or silver, and we're allowed to make fun of anyone on reddit. But at the same time we should look at ourselves and ask why we're doing it."

todayilearned,ff3mxeu,t1_ff3i0pl,1579544479.0,"Where do you have this from? Statistics show that increased penalties have a great effect on certain types of crimes (and much lesser so for other). That is why white collar crime is severely punished, while a pedo gets very little. This is because the latter is pretty much incurable, and it's expensive and doesn't yield any good results to keep them in prison. It's cheaper and easier to just ban them from anywhere there's kids around and inform the local police to patrol around their house, or force them over into hospitals. Which is also a reason some sentences feel extremely low, because some offenders are also sentenced to psych/pedo programs after their 2-3 years in prison."

comedyheaven,fe98q49,t1_fe8u3j8,1578935416.0,"Another guy commented he was quite happy with what he got, but I think it's because he specified titties or boobies or something."
comedyheaven,fe96eow,t1_fe8t9d9,1578934783.0,"I read a comment on that from one of the ""PM\_ME"" guys, and he said he got a ton of great pics from girls who DMed him. They actually send lots of selfies. 

I see there's another guy who wasn't that lucky, but I think you have to specify what you're going for. Like this guy's nick was ""PM titties"" or something."

todayilearned,fe637ee,t1_fe4n9pl,1578880762.0,"Plan out everything, wear safety gear, take your time. Spend a lot of time understanding what can go wrong and the consequences. This is very important because there's so many different situations you'll find yourself in. Standing around a good sized spruce will take your head clean off when it bounces back and you're too close to the stem. Honestly I don't like working with it no more, we should use machines as much as possible."

interestingasfuck,fe315gz,t1_fe2v06z,1578844911.0,"Dude, you would get to see an exhibit of the closest and most important bonding between a primate mother and her baby. Unethical tests have shown up to a 50% rate in kids that doesn't get breastfed and the physical warmth of a mother. 

Not saying we have to raise a flag every time a mother whips her tit out, but for that baby it's everything. And for that then maybe some reverence instead of annoyance would be in order. 

And hey, I love my girlfriend and her perfect breasts, but it's funny to see a different one out in the wild :)"

If the show had gone with period music then all Jaskier's songs would feel irrelevant to everyone but the music nerds. Maybe it would give a more authentic shine, but you wouldn't experience his music the way they actually did back in the day."
