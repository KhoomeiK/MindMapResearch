AskDocs,felgbco,t3_epr3a7,1579221504.0,NAD but I know sometimes conditions can cause you to feel anxious and that's a symptom not the nessecarily the underlying condition.  If it happens after eating could it be something with your blood sugar?  If you're in high school maybe speak to the school nurse about it?

I loved the book, it's called a break up because its broken.  Fun easy read but it has some really great points and really makes you think, and helps you with ways to heal.  Also, don't be afraid to see a therapist - sometimes I think people should treate mental health like they treat getting a sinus infection, when you're going through something hard and you need help processing see someone that can help with that!  Sending internet hugs - you've got this."
JustNoSO,fe4ibyj,t3_ensitk,1578859583.0,Maybe find a hobby? I know that's always helped me during a break up... do you like dogs or cats? I also find them helpful when I'm sad and a need a reason to keep moving forward
