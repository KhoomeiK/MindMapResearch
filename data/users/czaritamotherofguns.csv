Nails,fdfu6pp,t3_ekz519,1578370316.0,"Emerald labs collagen formula is the BEST. If can grab 2 bottles you should. Just a heads up, in my experience this formula is so effective it can be hard to keep up with shaving and hair color, as it really stimulates hair growth when you follow the directions on the bottle. Also, get a nail brush and brush your nails at least twice a day and don't skimp on the nail oil.
     As for the crack itself, cut a small piece off a silk tea bag and use base coat to adhere it to nail.
    Sally Hansen insta fix works too. It has a brush on glue and a dip powder you build up over the crack and then file down smooth."
