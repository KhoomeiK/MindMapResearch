aww,ff1odbb,t1_ff1j2m5,1579482585.0,"This is the fourth fresh schnoodle sighting today and the second within an hour of being posted. I need to do two things:

1. Get off Reddit because clearly I’ve spent too much time here today. 

2. Buy a lotto ticket because it must be my lucky day with all of these original schnoodle poems!"
aww,ff0j5rd,t1_ff0hqak,1579469375.0,This is the second post in a row I’ve seen with a Schnoodle original and this one is new. This is going to be a great day!
GalaxysEdge,fewl744,t1_fermspv,1579413335.0,"My husband built a light saber last time and it was really neat but this time I get to build a droid and I’m
SO excited. I’m glad to hear you had a good experience! I haven’t heard too much about it."
Disneyland,fepfdwg,t1_fepefbm,1579319122.0,"Will do, thank you!"
Disneyland,fepcwfl,t1_fepb6nr,1579317424.0,"Oh good! Because some places (like Ticketmaster) lock you out if the same account tries in two queues. 

Thank you!!"
Disneyland,fepb0xv,t3_eq2eqv,1579316164.0,"If my husband and I both have passes and both have the app—can we both try for a boarding pass? Do we need to have two different Disneyland log ins? Mine is the one w all of our reservations currently linked to it.

We’re going at the end of February and I want to be as prepared as possible so we have the best chance of getting a boarding pass!"
weightwatchers,fep388p,t1_feod2y2,1579311133.0,Thank you! Lots of rest and fluids definitely.
weightwatchers,fep36mg,t1_feookyz,1579311104.0,"That makes sense, thanks :)"

aww,feh90jb,t1_feh2h9s,1579111645.0,Currently watching that movie as I type this....that part was about an hour ago too!
AskWomenOver30,fecmv71,t3_eoe7ak,1578977857.0,"I don’t do everything every day, but I do enough of all those things throughout the week that it adds up.

I can’t (more like don’t want to) cook everyday, so sometimes we go out or I pick something up. That’s okay and we enjoy it.

As for cleaning, I hated dedicating my days off to it so hiring a housekeeper that comes in a couple times a month is the best thing ever. In between the housekeeper and her helper coming in, it’s much easier to keep on top of the little things."

ABraThatFits,fdtx8u2,t3_emrty6,1578723692.0,"I’ve had luck w meundies. It sounds like we are on very opposite sides of the size spectrum but it covers my entire vulva and doesn’t even roll down on my stomach pouch. Which, believe me, is saying something."
AskWomenOver30,fdtrmpi,t3_emv8dj,1578721119.0,"Not really. It’s been kind of weird as my friends starting having kids because they’re not as available to chat or hang out anymore. 

I like it being just my husband and me. I really can’t imagine coming home after a day of working and having to take some of someone or having to still be “on”. To be honest, it sounds miserable."
ABraThatFits,fdpo1an,t3_emlv1l,1578634235.0,"Ahh darn, foiled again. I got excited and looked it up but they don’t go up to my band size."
ThatsInsane,fdj2dft,t3_el6hjr,1578456649.0,I was there!!! It was awesome.
weightwatchers,fdixs4i,t1_fditirf,1578453469.0,"I hadn’t thought to do that but I’ve been on there 5 days and those people are already bothering me. I didn’t join to be preached at and blocking them will be what I do from now on!

Thank you!"
fastfood,fde8u4d,t1_fde3nal,1578333712.0,Ahhh freebirds. I went to Cal Poly but I can remember the road tripping down to IV and hitting up freebirds.
weightwatchers,fd70d29,t3_ek3pkn,1578197926.0,"Hi!! I’m on day two too!! 

On day 1, I was surprised with a chocolate chip cookie from chick fil a by a friend who didn’t know it was WW Day 1. Instead of scarfing it down immediately, I brought it home and took one big bite and gave the rest to my husband.....who then also gave me the last small bite. 

I love that man and I love cookies."

This is a good start to the new year!"
AskReddit,fcp6feq,t3_ei9bm3,1577852007.0,"Before I was married, I had a really long single and dry spell.  

Sometimes it felt like I was craving touch. I’d be talking to one of my employees (I’m a manager at a bank) and i would get this weird urge to hug them. I never acted on my impulse cuz it would have been weird but I was painfully aware of how long it had been since I had been embraced or put my arms around somebody else."
AskReddit,fcp5pif,t1_fcp244o,1577851312.0,"My husband and I met when he was 43 and got married when he was 45, so it’s never too late."
ABraThatFits,fck0o77,t3_ehgmkh,1577712906.0,My band size is wayyy bigger than yours but I feel your pain!! Finding a band size plus cup size that fit these omega girls comfortably? I’m not saying it’s impossible but...........I’m almost there.
TaylorSwift,fc0ktty,t3_efcayu,1577293237.0,"I’m crying, this is great. 

That was me ten years ago when I opened up tickets to the Fearless Tour—my mom had taped them to the CD."
Kitchenaid,fbws3sq,t1_fbwrqoi,1577157958.0,"I wish I had the room to nicely display or store multiples! I received a larger one in red for Christmas a few years ago, which matches my current kitchen better. I sold the old one on Facebook and somebody snapped it up quick!"
Kitchenaid,fbwmrnc,t3_eesv4o,1577154018.0,"Cute!! My first one was that color, I loved it!"
insaneparents,fbujpfp,t1_fbuhj5x,1577115566.0,"Most important documents can have “certified copies” ordered, which are just as good as originals. If you’re in the US, it’s also very easy to get a replacement social security card. 

He may be able to get all those documents without needing to ask his parents for originals. Power struggle is no problem for you guys anymore then."
