AmItheAsshole,fgkkluh,t1_fgjwy6s,1580867744.0,"Even if they weren't ok with it, they were nice to the bf. That's respectful. Your wife on the other hand..."
AmItheAsshole,fgkgye0,t3_eyv26b,1580865325.0,"NTA. When you find what works, you use it!  

I would speak to your wife about the how she talks to you. That's unacceptable. Period. Then remind your daughter that it was a simple picture. It could be worse....you didn't hit her or trash or things or ground her. It's actually pretty mild as punishments go."
AmItheAsshole,fgkgc2y,t1_fgj33a5,1580864910.0,"She says he ended the affair when she found out. He got caught. He didn't end it organically, so I imagine his wife is questioning if there are still feelings there for the mistress. Seeing the mistress again, especially in such an emotional situation, might bring those feelings rushing back."

HumansBeingBros,fgep4vf,t1_fgeme1c,1580705384.0,My pets are family members. He's a sweet old man and I'd feel bad if he didn't have a warm place to sleep!
HumansBeingBros,fgec0zv,t1_fgbg7gu,1580696118.0,"We have a (former) stray that adopted us. He can't be in the house because 1. He freaks out if he's in longer than 30 minutes and 2) I have a dog that will eat him. So we set him up in the garage with a litter box, fresh water and food, and a cozy basket with blankets. We feed him his evening meal in our kitchen while I heat his bedding up in the dryer. He seems pretty happy with the arrangement because he prowls during the day, but always comes home when he's done. FYI we did neuter and vaccinate him, so he's not contributing to the stray population."
bridezillas,fgebgw7,t1_fgc7h6o,1580695763.0,"I want to renew vows on our 25th anniversary (in 5 years), but I don't want a second fancy wedding. I want a theme/costume party with a renewal ceremony in the middle of it. Remember that reality show a few years back featuring redneck weddings? I want to do that. Wear trashy clothes, mattress surf in the mud behind ATV's, keg stands, dip cans in back pockets, and a redneck buffet with pigs in a blanket, pork and beans, a hog roast, etc. I want it to be a big white trash party. No hen party, no gifts and if you stand up with me, buy your dress at goodwill. It's going to get dirty, so it needs to be cheap. I can't wait!!!"

AmItheAsshole,fg8h938,t1_fg8cb51,1580619430.0,"I'm a super smiley woman and say hi or nod at the regulars at my gym. I don't converse with them or bother them..just acknowledge my fellow gym mates. I didn't go for a couple of months because life got busy, I have a small home gym and worked out there as my gym is 20 minutes away. My first day back, I had a couple guys ask if I was ok and one said he missed my smiling face and hoped I hadn't given up on my goals lol. Not in a pervy way, just friendly. I didn't know I'd be missed, but it was nice to realize there were people secretly cheering me on. Gym dudes are the best!"

AskReddit,fg79ke1,t3_ex82tf,1580587196.0,"I've stayed at fancier hotels and some dive motels, but the one I liked the most was a stupid La Quinta inn in Huntsville Alabama a decade ago. It definitely wasn't fancy, but it was spotless and the staff was amazing. We were there visiting friends and decided to extend our stay. They gave us a discount for staying longer and when we asked for anything, like extra towels, they were quick to deliver. They also didn't try to give us one towel, they gave us a damn stack. They also sent up a basket full of goodies (free of charge) for our three kids with coupons for local activities. It was just excellent service from a low budget hotel."

AskReddit,fg5juz6,t1_fg59usa,1580529448.0,My neighbor had a gastro virus and it lasted 24 hours. She was sicker than a dog and ended up getting fluids and some meds. A lot of people think the flu is vomiting and diarrhea when it's really a respiratory illness. Maybe that's what was going around your office?
AskReddit,fg54g7z,t1_fg383nb,1580518024.0,"When my son was in jr high (he's 28 now), we took him and a friend to a WWE show where Edge was wrestling. After, we hit up a steakhouse for dinner and Edge walked in with another wrestler (part of a tag team I didn't know but that guy was not friendly). My son was so excited and they ended up sitting in the booth behind us. I didn't want to draw attention to him so I tapped him on the shoulder and discreetly asked if my boy (insert name) could get his autograph. A few minutes later, he passed a napkin back to me made out to my son with his autograph. I thanked him and my son was smiling like a loon lol. He must have overheard me tell the waitress it was his birthday because he told him happy birthday as we were leaving. I've been a fan ever since. Nice guy."

JustNoTruth,fg4xav8,t1_fg4vj0n,1580513179.0,Ah ok. I couldn't find. I must have typed it in wrong.
JustNoTruth,fg4swpk,t3_ewvl14,1580510394.0,She deleted her post and her account. I guess the truth really does hurt.
JUSTNOMIL,fg4ro31,t3_ewuokt,1580509605.0,"You're mad because everyone is telling you truths you don't want to hear? Too bad. Your child is your first responsibility. Not a grown woman. She's going to eventually really hurt him. Also, this abuse? Yeah, that's going to stick with him into adulthood. I know...I was an abused kid. She needs to go. Now. I'm not sure what it is that you wanted to hear, but there is only one realistic solution here and you're not willing to do it, so....???"
AskReddit,fg4jlin,t1_fg42nov,1580504594.0,This makes me happy. I hate when I hear that one of my favorites is an asshat.

AmItheAsshole,fg4hrl4,t3_ewnfqx,1580503528.0,NTA. Tell your so called friend that you've discussed this with your vet and he feels it's unnecessary and risky and that you'll be taking the advice of the person with the actual degree in vet medicine.

AmItheAsshole,fg111cn,t3_ew4zxd,1580418824.0,"NTA. I love my dogs and they are treated like valued family members. I've lost several over the years and it hurts. I still miss them all and think of them often. However, I also have kids, one at home, the rest are grown. If one of them died, I'd be devastated. As much as I love my pets, it wouldn't compare to losing a child, even an adult child. You maybe could have been more gentle with your delivery, but you weren't wrong."
