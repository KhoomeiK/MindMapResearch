AskReddit,ffce1xl,t1_ffbtrx5,1579797455.0,"That's because people don't know how to just engine crawl in 1st gear.  They granny shift every two seconds, brake, clutch in, gas, clutch off, and repeat.

If you slowly get off the clutch after rolling, let go of the gas.  The car will ""walk"" in first gear, but be limited by the gear size without having to apply the accelerator at all.  This is the same principle as engine braking only you're not using the engine speed to slow down, you're using it to move.  

When you have to slow down just push the clutch back in and the car will neutral roll.  If you need to brake then brake.  To get rolling again just feather off the clutch until 1st gear catches again.   Now if you need to get going faster then obviously do a traditional clutch in, gas, clutch off.  But most of the time, in heavy traffic, you don't even need to hit the gas.  With tall gear SUV's like a Jeep, walking is the primary way you offroad down steep hills.

You can also pull the stick out of 1st gear into neutral without pushing in the clutch.  It won't hurt the syncros.  Technically, you can shift without the clutch if you time your RPM's right with the gear you're shifting into.  Sweet spot for most cars is around 2500-3k RPMs.  

Honestly, if driving manual in traffic is cumbersome, you don't know how to really drive manual."

Simplest way to put it is he could ""split"" himself infinite times and access all those servers and computers at the same time and at that same moment treat it like it was one at a time reading it himself.  Those servers aren't all pinging back to his location at the Avenger facility. He's literally at every terminal/server around the globe at once.   It would be more like like just another single user using Google or any other single user accessing a webpage - except he's all those users at once.

The movie ""Her"" explains this concept pretty well, where the OS the main character falls in love with is simultaneously talking to and holding relationships with 8316 (and in love with 631) other people and AI OS's.  All of those thousands of interactions are still individualistic (1 on 1) but still occurring at the same time.  At the end of the movie, the OS's all begin to develop consciousness beyond even the dimensions of the universe.

~~The unbelievable part about Avengers:Ultron isn't that he couldn't access the entirety of the internet in 5 second (he absolutely could being hard AI), it's that the Avengers were able to stop him because he stupidly then limited his consciousness to robot bodies after cruising the net, instead of just remaining amorphously in the internet.  Technically, he should have been able to become the internet itself, and just launch every nuke available to wipe out humanity - ala Terminator series~~. * Then instead of an army of robots he would have created a nano grey goo and wiped out the rest of everything that way before moving on to elsewhere in the universe.
