Wellthatsucks,ffq9xtl,t1_ffq48sx,1580127602.0,"The difference in cost is b/c with a 3rd party delivery service, you have to pay the driver  separately.  The restaurant includes the wage for the driver (and hosts if you ate there) with the food when they deliver it themselves.

Edit: Forgot about the bit about the hosts/wait staff."
PlayStationPlus,ffq8min,t3_eukune,1580126030.0,"Try turning on UPnP on one of your routers.  When you do that, the game will tell your router to send anyone knocking on that port to your game session on the ps4.  Without UPnP on, the router would only see a random knock on that port and won't know what to do with it, so it normally ignores it.  I often turn it off because it's a network security issue, but not that big of a deal.

Setting your PS4 to be the DMZ is usually a bad idea.  Any random requests to your ip address (and there could be thousands an hour) would have to be handled by the PS4, instead of your router.  It'll probably fix your issue, but it's overkill."

Yep. You can reply to me or makes your own top level comment thread to see the pm it sends you, should be this same exact link. IDK about PM's to the bot directly for such links though. 

I prefer this bot bc the Reddit link doesn't work well for my non Reddit friends."
aww,ffq4ijk,t1_ffq4fdg,1580120029.0,"Naw. It sends me a PM saying that it's banned from this sub. So I just edit my invocation of the bot and add the link I get from it. You should have gotten one as well, unless it blocked you or you spelled it's named wrong."

unpopularopinion,ffq2w3a,t1_ffpydpm,1580117416.0,It's one of those things that sparked a discussion about getting consent in writing beforehand to cover your ass. There's no real way to prove such a thing since it's he said / she said at the time.

No one thought he deserved it, it was said that he just got it from a working or volunteering at a kissing booth. The image for HIV positive people pretty much changed over night."
