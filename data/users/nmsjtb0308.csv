PoliticalHumor,fgarw4h,t1_fg7uru2,1580654700.0,"Question. I checked my status and I'm registered (We moved last year. I wanted to ensure my information was updated).

However, my husband is not. When I was registering him, it wanted his in-state driver's license. He does not have one. He still has his license from our previous residence. Is there a way to get around that?

FWIW, I also still have my out of state license, so there must be a way to do it?

We are currently in Indiana, previously lived in Florida."
AskReddit,fgan8hi,t3_exgy9m,1580653234.0,"A lady came into the restroom once while I was already in a stall. A few seconds later, I hear, ""I'm sorry for anyone who has to hear this"". She then proceeded to make herself vomit. I was young and completely taken aback by what was unfolding, so I just said, ""I hope you get better"" then left the restroom. 

Still to this day I think of her often. I hope she was able to fight her demons and get healthy. :("
HumansBeingBros,fg7qqbt,t1_fg7qd34,1580599090.0,"Who knows. Insurance companies are weird. 

The crazy thing is, everyone is so sue happy and can't take responsibility for themselves, I guarantee you'd still get sued if the little troublemaker down the street climbed both of your fences and drowned. They'd probably even sue if he got injured climbing the fence."
HumansBeingBros,fg7q5su,t1_fg7p1mt,1580598683.0,"Around here, a fence is required by law if you have a pool and insurance companies won't cover you without one. 

And, I agree. I feel it's common knowledge that there's a certain risk with everything you do. Kids play, kids get hurt. It's no one's fault. Shit happens. Just because they happened to get hurt while on your property doesn't make it your fault. 

I could see you being responsible if your kid maliciously caused the injury, but normal every day accidents, no. 

I didn't sue the furniture store my son busted his head open at because he was the one running when he shouldn't have been. If it was anyone's fault, it was his."
Marriage,fg7pbtp,t1_fg7ob39,1580598096.0,"No, nothing like that. Our core values are in line with each other. Everything else is individual to us. We each like a lot of things the other doesn't. I have my life, he has his, and we have ours. 

I'm just having difficulty grasping him choosing to preach that 2+2=5 when I've got mountains of evidence showing the contrary that he won't entertain.

There's normally no issue with us providing knowledge to one another when one lacks it or is misinformed. We each have our strengths and weaknesses. I don't get why it's different this time. I think that's my biggest hang up."
blackcats,fg7n4hf,t1_fg7m143,1580596550.0,"LOL She's still a kitten, 7# or so. Her frame is very lean. Though he isn't a small cat at all... 14# or so, and he's very stout... Very Tom cat like."
Marriage,fg7ktpo,t1_fg7k9em,1580594946.0,"You make a good point. I don't think I was trying to get him to agree with my side, but it may have seemed that way... And I did get most of my explanation out before he ended the conversation. 

Maybe having heard me say it will pique his interest and he'll look into it himself. Maybe not. I'm not going to push it anymore though."
Marriage,fg7kn7i,t1_fg7fcmp,1580594820.0,"And that would be understandable but that's not what he was doing. He was adamant that he feels how he feels because side Q wants to do X, Y, Z and he doesn't agree. What I was trying to show him was that side Q only wants to do X and X is completely irrelevant to him in any capacity. 

I just don't get refusing to be fully informed about something you're so adamant about. However, I'm dropping it. It's not worth causing waves when he's made it clear he feels how he feels."
Marriage,fg7jui8,t1_fg7eo4u,1580594266.0,I'm not trying to change his path. I only wanted him to be fully informed but it's clear to me that his mind is made up. I'm going to let it go.
Marriage,fg7jp9u,t1_fg7ej1t,1580594164.0,"I am. I only wanted him to be fully informed, but it's clear that's not going to happen. At least not from me. We're just going to agree to disagree and I won't bring it up again."
Marriage,fg7jk6y,t1_fg7ie61,1580594066.0,"It's not that they contradict my beliefs, per say. It's more, I can't believe he's so stuck on this *one* thing that he dismisses everything else that's more important AND relevant to our lives. 

And the one thing he's so passionate about is what he's incorrect about. He thinks they want to do X, Y, Z when it's actually only X. Not only that, but X is irrelevant to him in any capacity and would not affect him in the slightest. That's why I don't understand. 

I'm letting it go though. Everyone else commented that he's entitled to his views, and I agree wholeheartedly. I just want him to be educated about it, is all. He's made it clear he feels how he feels so it'll only cause waves if I keep bringing it up. We're just going to agree to disagree."
news,fg77v8n,t1_fg6f8cw,1580586051.0,"I hate our bullshit ass justice system. It is so unfair. 

I have a 5 year old misdemeanor petty theft charge (Valued at $94) that has literally disqualified me from more jobs than I can remember because no one wants to hire a thief. Especially retail.

I'm ineligible for expungement because I was found guilty (FL law).

I spent 24 hours in jail, 6 months on probation with biweekly check ins, random drug tests and house calls, and probation fees. I had to do 25 hours of community service and I had to take a theft prevention class. 

I lost the job I had at the time and had a helluva time finding a job that'd 1) hire me and 2) could work around my probation restrictions and biweekly check ins. The house I'm currently renting made me pay a ridiculous security deposit because of it, and only after I begged and pleaded for a chance. 

ONE fuck up in my ENTIRE life has limited my employment opportunities to jobs that either don't do background checks or only care about felonies. I am a 31 year old white female college graduate. It is utterly embarrassing, depressing, and discouraging. 

I completely understand why hard criminals sometimes feel like they have no choice but to continue that life. They can't find good, honest work.

I recognize I fucked up and I paid my dues, but when I read stories like this, I get so fucking bitter. It is such bullshit.

Edit: I forgot. I'm limited on how involved I can be at my kid's school, too. I can go on field trips and eat lunch with them if I want, but that's it."

aww,fg40smh,t1_fg26eed,1580493763.0,"Beyond Apache, my boy (100# Shepherd we lost last April at 10) was an only dog for about 4 years after his friend lost her battle to cancer. When he was 8, we thought a puppy would motivate him to get off his ass and move some, hence helping delay the progression of arthritis and keep him mobile for longer. 

It was more than we ever could have hoped for. He found companionship, something he hadn't known in 4 years... His heart was so full, having another friend to cuddle with, to play with, and to keep him company when he was home alone. Even if the puppy didn't help him physically (What we perceived as arthritis was actually Degenerative Myelopathy... Nothing we could have done), it absolutely helped his mental health and he was definitely a happier dog in his final days.

This is the same reason nursing homes will have daycares/schools/etc. bring kids by for activities and such. It gives the elderly reason to get out of bed and gives them reason to smile. 

I highly recommend it."
progresspics,fg3z40n,t1_fg3o24b,1580492746.0,"Great minds. I thought of you last night, but didn't want to make your phone chime a notification and possibly wake you up in the middle of the night so I said I'd wait until today, haha.

I've checked myself in the intake department, but I'm still not running. I *loathe* the cold weather (Hence why I ran away to FL 5 years ago, but got dragged back up north last year). I'm holding steady, but that's still 5 pounds over my goal weight. I'll focus on those 5 pounds once I can go outside again.

How you feel is ultimately the most important thing. If you want some applause for kicking ass and taking names, post a progress pic on here. This is a killer subreddit for confidence boosts.

I live with my husband. I control the food so he plays no part in it. He is obnoxious about complimenting me though (Not a bad thing, LOL, but it makes it easier to stay dormant) and when I tell him to stay on me about my late night intake and he does, I get all pissy and offended, like he's calling me fat. Such a woman thing of me to do, LMAO, so he doesn't ever say shit anymore and I don't blame him.

Does new chef BF (Totally jealous, BTW. I've been the sole food preparer for 11 years.) know you're on this journey? You need to tell him. If he's good people, he'll be sensitive to that and will prepare foods that coincide with your goals. This would be a killer way to open up a new line of communication between you two, where you can help him prepare foods that are you-friendly.

<3 Thank you for thinking of me."
