BPDlovedones,ff8xee6,t3_es54x9,1579699197.0,"It’s a strategy to undermine your perception of reality to avoid accountability for their abuse, aka “crazy making.”  The goal is to sew confusion and self doubt in the minds of their victims.  Since they lack a well developed sense of remorse or empathy or conscience, they have no limits when they terrorize or covertly provoke you. They can be incredibly cruel.  It is highly effective too.  He has you believing YOU’RE the crazy one.  You’re not.  

As far as mutual friends/relatives perceptions go, don’t worry about it.  Just exit quietly, don’t fight back or seek revenge, and go hard no contact.

politics,ff6152t,t1_ff5rhyw,1579616463.0,"I’ve noticed that a lot with friends that identify as conservative/Republicans.  Most of their decisions are based on feelings.  Here’s the problem with that approach, as I see it: Feelings are not facts.  They can also change over time.  2+2=4.  No matter how strongly I may feel it is actually 5, it is not.  It is and always will be 4 regardless of how I feel about it.   When you show them conclusive data that 2+2 is indeed 4, and that fact conflicts with their view, they believe they are being tricked somehow.  How can it be 4 when I feel so strongly that it’s 5?   You must be trying to pull a fast one..."
