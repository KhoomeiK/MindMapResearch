As for what the upgrades are going to be, look at the PC version of the game running at least high graphics. Hopefully Bungie will start rendering the cutscenes at 60 fps because its noticeable on PC when your frames dip all of a sudden."

Bastion is amazing for shielded majors because it tears through them. Its good against bosses and if you use it on minors you will run out of ammo quickly

this is the comment I replied to originally

This is my first comment telling the guy that the quest steps where datamined and that Gladd's chat knew it was bastion as soon as he got the quest from the final puzzle room. not that they where upset because they knew already.


>So what you are saying is this would be fine if we didnt find out the dissapointment until we finish the quest... okay then.

I only meant to tell him that the quest for bastion was datamined. He said the gun wasn't datamined which it wasn't it was a known weapon it was shown in trailers and the roadmap.


If the quest steps hadn't been datamined then it would have still disapointed people when he got the gun."

This seems powerful but heres the plan when the ammo box is released give all players the scrapbox for free forever, then eventually the ammo box will become free to everyone and Fo1st members will get another new item. This way Fo1st is a really good way to get atoms and cosmetics and you get to use the powerful stuff before everyone else.



edit: yeah it kind of defeats the purpose of ammo having weight its all hypothetical and I think they should at least get something to replace the scrapbox and give everyone it (or at least a box that can hold 100 pounds of every scrap)"
