First of all, in medical literature when it is used, it is used to refer to the index patient. Not the patient who is thought to have been the first. So use in zombie fiction has confused and muddled the meaning. 

Second, because there's a lot of homophobia and racism and other stuff tangled up in a lot of historic uses of the term patient zero, especially those that reached mainstream awareness through news media . . . such as the AIDS epidemic. 

Third, because when it does reach the media, the patient zero ends up getting a lot of scorn and ridicule, and if the person is ever publicly named, that can really badly effect their reputation. If they're not named in the public literature, it's still not nice to see so many undeserved condemnations of yourself everywhere. You're already sick, why would the doctors put you through that. 

Fourth, because insofar as patient zero is a useful term and concept, 'index patient' is a strictly better term & concept. Want to know what the condition looks like to identify in others? Pick a patient where you can tell what symptoms of theirs are coming from the condition, when the onset of those symptoms occurred in their timeline, and what those onsets looked like. Your actual first patient, if you can even identify them, (see next point), probably isn't a very good index patient. They probably were already otherwise ill or had chronic conditions, or were old or young, or pregnant, or otherwise vulnerable, and that's why they were the first. 

Fifth, because it's bad science to try and deduce a single patient zero or attribute any epidemiology to them. Uncertainties and coincidences are just too high, and the direction of an epidemic can only be traced statistically. That is to say, the person who shows any signs of symptoms first might not have been the first carrier. If my sister gets sick, and then I get sick, it's entirely possible that *I* was the one that got her sick. 

When you draw lines down to individuals, you're probably even making connections between people where there are none, because one or both people in that connection got infected by a silent carrier, or both branches are reversed from their actual direction, or both are end-branches. The good news for epidemiology, tho, is that when you do end up making a web of individual connections to try and trace stuff, the type of information you intend to derive from the graph doesn't really care about directionality too much, and only is statistical output, so you can get the graph, like, >50% wrong and it doesn't impact the helpfulness of information derived from it. Especially because regardless of how much I get wrong, the general flow of the graph is almost guaranteed to be correct. I mean, viruses and bacteria can only hibernate for so long, and statistically, your earliest cases in region a] probably had the same onset time as the earliest cases in [region b], so you can definitely trace region-to-region on some scale, usually on the scales of towns/cities. 

And in the cases where it's worth finding a single patient zero, say, to contain everyone who was exposed to them, it's also worth it to just . . . contain everyone who was exposed to any sick person. If that's too large a group, then the real patient zero is probably still connected to the supposed patient zero. So if you're wrong, well, you probably still have your real patient zero in your contained group, ya still did the right thing. And if you did the right thing, you'll likely never know if you're correct or not, or how likely it is that you were correct."
AskGameMasters,ffb95l9,t1_ffb85u2,1579755740.0,"As a philosophical aside, I wouldn't call it 'masking'. The game happens in both the narrative and the mechanics, not just in the mechanics. If it happened only in the mechanics, why not play a boardgame? 

You are actually making and causing something different, it's only one element of it that's repetitive. And your players will respond to those situations differently even when they would have identical mechanics. 

But, eh, philosophical aside, it really doesn't matter in any respect :p"
AskGameMasters,ffb3fpq,t3_esevxl,1579750797.0,"Ah, well, if you're playing in a system where there's that many calls-for-narrative like that, chances are you shouldn't be letting players get away with stuff like ""I attack"", and that's really where most people's problems will lie.

When your players are actively narrating what they're doing, in battle or otherwise, there's no trouble to come up with a complication. 

""There's a guy in front of you with a gun who seems to be trying to tie something up while keeping the gun trained on you, there's a guy with a cutlass over by the mast, what do you do?""

""I attack the guy with the cutlass!""

**""Ok, how?""**

And then the *effects* might get stale, (enemy has better defence, you tripped, damage, weapon breaks), but they won't *feel* stale, they'll feel like they came from the narrative. 

If a weak success (take damage) is that the guy with a gun squeezes off a shot, that doesn't feel stale, that feels like a natural complication of the situation. Dude was ready. If your player swings at the dude with the cutlass, and his reaction is to grab the players blade by the false edge after getting hit, that's just another variant of disarmed/weapon broke/weapon arm bound, but it doesn't feel stale. The player could also cut through the ropes of the rigging (""take damage"" from falling stuff), get the blade stuck in the deck after the slash (another weapon disarm), or end up tossed against the deck as a wave hits during their lunge (you tripped). 

If even given that sort of narrative and information, it's hard for you come up with this kind of stuff off the top of your head, then when you're doing your planning, just come up with 5 or so such complications that fit each potential combat setting uniquely, don't worry about the effects being samey because the narrative won't be, and when you have a sudden inspiration, go for it. 


As an aside, I'm not familiar with the system you mention, but check if there are any techniques or anything on the player's end that they might be able to make use of to boost their roles. Usually in such systems, if you narrate certain things happening, you get to add a bonus. In PDQ#, for example, I might have the technique 'rapier' chained to my fencing forte, and I might have ""vs. pirates"", and  "" . . . with a smirk"" as unchained techniques. If I describe my character as attacking with a) a rapier, b) describe how I'm using my knowledge/hatred/whatever justification against pirates, and c)why they're smirking/similar notes on how they look while they're pulling it all off, I get to roll 3 extra dice and keep the highest [amount I would normally roll] . . . and **give a lot of fodder to my GM for the narrative**. 

If there's not a system like that, you might be able to help yourself by cobbling one together. Rolling more dice and keeping the highest is OP for a lot of dice systems, but you might be able to hand stuff out like 'inspiration points' if characters fulfil certain 'idioms' some # of times, with the 'idioms' being a new thing you give them. 

But, until you've actually played, and found it to be a problem, and **your players have found it to be a problem**, I wouldn't worry enough to implement house rules."

todayilearned,feieqfr,t1_fei6ww7,1579136797.0,"In addition to what was said, which deals with better processing rather than hearing, better hearing also directly doesn't mean louder. Or, worse hearing doesn't mean quieter. 

So there's a minimum threshold of sound pressure level at which your ears will pick up sound. 

The apparent loudness will grow from there logarithmically with increasing sound pressure level (spl). 

If I have any type of hearing damage, and can't hear anything at a particular frequency below, say, ""50"" units of SPL, then you might think that the apparent loudness that I hear at ""100"" SPL is 50% of a healthy person's.

NOPE. 

After ""50"" SPL, there's an attack, that is, a partwhere the apparent loudness to me grows extra-logarithmically, quickly reaching almost the same apparent loudness as anyone else, and then the apparent loudness increases with SPL as everyone else's. 

Even if your general hearing is at ""10%"", well, we measure SPL in decibels, and every 3 decibels is DOUBLE the pressure. So that would be a 10ish decibel SPL difference . . . which doesn't change apparent loudness that much. 

I mean, a 70dB thing can be hard to hear over a 80dB thing, (which doesn't have much to do with the apparent loudnesses), but if all of your hearing is tuned down . . . not that much of a difference in apparent loudness. 


So worse hearing happens through having a higher minimum sound pressure level to hear, not through having a longer attack/lower apparent volume."
technicallythetruth,fegg61c,t1_fegd8m4,1579091665.0,"Eh, not really. The largest part of the epithet treadmill is that the class of people doing the insulting are also the class of people who decide the next name, so the linguistic-philosophical underpinnings, the coverage of the term, and the connections, are either exactly the same, or wrong in a different way. 

""African-american"" and ""People of Colour"", terms chosen by African Americans and People of Colour respectively, haven't gone down the epithet treadmill. But it's been 40 & 50 years respectively since they undoubtedly entered common use. 

As long as all of the philosophical constructs that can be covered under each word can slide to being covered under the 'next' word, well, that's what gives the term its meaning and connections, so of course it ends up meaning exactly the same thing."

todayilearned,fde48qb,t1_fde1v6w,1578330829.0,"So the long story short is that the industry that is campaigning for less environmental protection, and who keep setting illegal fires on lands not already cleared, are mining companies. 

Almost nothing of the land that the argicultural industry burns is old-growth forest. Almost all of the old growth forest being burned is being burned by mining interests. 

There's a few angles to it . . . it kills the indigenous protectors of the land, once the land is no longer old-growth forest it doesn't have the same protections, it covers up the environmental impacts of mining, it shifts attention away from mining sites, etc. 

There's something like 2,500 illegal mining sites in the amazon.

Of the recent *legal* sites, the mines themselves occupy something like 250k acres of rainforest, (some 415k in total, that is, including the area outside the rainforest), with add'l damage to the environment far beyond that. 


Once the area is already burned, then farms often do move in to the now less-protected area around any areas that have had their mineral rights staked out. 


There is a question of how much more rainforest agriculture would be burning if there wasn't already someone doing it, but that's not the immediately relevant concern."

Because it shows the possibility of direct results, not just confusion and distraction. 

So, say I buy a thing for $1, I hand the cashier a $10, and I get back $9 in change. 

I talk about the need for bus change, change some of that into suitable bus change, keep interrupting the flow of thought with asides like ""Wait, what is bus fare these days?"", halfway through I discover my change purse, I go like, ""hey, shit, actually, can I change this up? Got a $10?"", get the $10, then give the cashier *back* the $10, and the original $9, now in various change, and while they're trying to count that up, be like, ""wait, what did I hand you?""

Well, they'll count up to $19. So hand them another buck, and get a $20 back. 

Upshot: Pay $10 to get a $1 item and 9$ in change. Get $10 from them. Hand back the $10 and the $9 in change, and then $1 more in change. Get $20 back. 

Total expenditure: pay $10 + give $10 + give $9 + give $1 = $30

Total income: get $9 + get $10 + get $20 = $39


And of the work that kept them too busy to catch on to what's happening, all of the currency to spend time adding up and exchanging, came from their own till.
