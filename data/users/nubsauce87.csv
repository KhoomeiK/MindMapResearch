dresdenfiles,fefx20z,t3_eoughp,1579068029.0,"So I tend to see Harry in the beginning as something of a Boy Scout. Helps old ladies across the street, any woman in danger, and he's there, that kinda thing. He wants to help, but isn't fully prepared for the gravity of the situation. 

Then midway through the series, he's more like the Hard-boiled and tortured Badass with a sidekick who idolizes him. He wants to do the right thing, but is willing to do some wrong things to get there. Three lefts make a right, after all.

At this point, I see him as an Antihero. He is literally the hitman for the Queen of the Court of Wicked Faeries. His student has become the master (in some ways, anyway). He has amassed great power, and while he questions whether he will use it in the right, he has no problems with employing it.

My prediction: Harry will Fall (notice the capital ""F""). He will become consumed by his power, all the while believing he's doing good. He will play Vader to Mab's Palpatine. It will take the combined efforts of Karrin, Molly, Michael, and the others, to snap him out of it, and he'll find a way out of his Knighthood. Then the BAT happens and he regrets relinquishing that much power."

technicallythetruth,fdv5yrm,t3_en581v,1578743669.0,"It's not so much that I don't like trucks... I just don't like them when they:

- Seemingly intentionally attempt to run me off the road 

- Nearly crush my car between them and the concrete divider on the freeway because checking mirrors before changing lanes is too much work, also without signaling

- Sit in the middle of an intersection blocking cross-traffic which is now stuck for another traffic light cycle

- Nearly crush my car again because they made an unreasonably wide right-turn at an intersection

- Rear-ending my friend at an intersection, bumping him into traffic, then just driving away when the light turns green, leaving my friend with a car which has been totally shit-housed

- Forming a convoy and refusing to yield to vehicles merging onto the freeway, which almost caused a multi-car pileup because there was no shoulder on the right at that part of the freeway

- Intentionally blocking my view of cross-traffic at a stop sign where cross-traffic does not stop, then moving up more to block my view again when I try to creep forward to see around him, then laughing and flipping me off while he sits there for as long as he feels like fucking with me

- Driving 20 mph under the speed limit in a 45 for reasons unknown to me with a line of 10+ cars behind them

I have experienced all of these things, some of them more than once, and that's just what I could remember off the top of my head.

Truckers used to be considered the White Knights of the road (or so I've heard), but now they're just bullies, or totally incompetent a scary amount of the time. This is why I'm very excited for self-driving semis; Or literally any other way of distributing goods to stores and such, because while that sign is unnecessarily sardonic, he's not wrong. They have us over a barrel and they know it."

insomnia,fdmxo78,t3_elyxns,1578570436.0,"So it's actually pretty common for even healthy sleepers to wake in the night. Society used to be built around that. People would ""retire"" earlier in the evening, sleep for 3-4 hours, get back up, drink, socialize, whatever, for an hour or two, then go back to bed.

Wasn't until the industrial revolution (I think) that people started cramming all 8 hours into one block.

So all that to say: Don't stress too hard about not ""sleeping through the night."""
insomnia,fdmwt18,t3_elyi3g,1578569396.0,"Yeah I did about the same thing for a while. For about two years straight I would only sleep if I drank until I passed out. I have definitely noticed that even if I only sleep for an hour or so, I'm waaay more rested than if I'm passed out drunk for 10 hours. When I stopped doing that, it was a solid week before I got any sleep at all. Had a few relapses and it's the same story every time. Alcohol is just about the worst sleep-aid in existence."
insomnia,fdmwj6v,t3_em84b2,1578569063.0,"Yeah I hate that. My insomnia is so bad that I tend to go four or more days without a single minute of sleep (I might be dozing for a few minutes here and there, but we all know that's no substitute). ""Oh, you only got seven hours last night? How terrible for you."" At this point I would do pretty much anything for a solid night's sleep."
