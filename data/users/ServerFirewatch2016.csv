The Pharisee’s were primarily responsible as they were veeeeery angry at the blatant breaking of Jewish law and Jesus calling out the hypocrisy of Pharisees lives and worship. 

However, when talking about “the Romans”, the same thing could be said; most Romans had no idea who Jesus was and those who did found him to be foreign in religion and presence. There are records of him helping Romans as well, including a centurion who’s daughter was extremely sick. Regardless of what you believe, Roman opinion was also divided on him, and even Pilate believed him to be an innocent man, but was forced by the Pharisees (who’d whipped a Jewish crowd into a frenzy over Jesus) to turn him over for Crucifixion."

No, it’s not some added fee or anything, but the belief of free absolution is extremely dangerous; it’s how many priests justify assaulting kids and being a Predator. The intra-denomination stigma is changing, although much slower than I’d like to see, that the Seal of Confession is no longer full proof; predators are no longer safe to just be redeemed of their sins.

And trust me, these are the good ones; the priest I trust most (former Navy Supply Officer, most morally stable man I’ve ever met, with a greater understanding of what sinning usually means in your life beyond “Satan is making you do it”) was replaced a few years ago by a priest who spent 20 years at the same parish. He moved from Oregon to San Diego abruptly on church orders, to help “foster youth development in the community”. It always struck me as odd, when I talked to him about something very private in my life, the way he responded made it sound like he misunderstood what I said and wanted to cover it up.

Rey isn’t a rip off, I gave my reasoning to why she isn’t and you didn’t even bother trying to present facts to argue otherwise. The light saber actually has a basic similarity to a staff: there is no blade in the sense that it is any less lethal when you hit someone with it in a certain direction or angle. There is no “hitting someone with the flat of a lightsaber”, no blunt end instead of a blade to bash someone with non-lethally. A staff is similar in its blunt-all-around nature. And I think you’re underestimating the range on Anakin’s saber; it’s over a meter long and Rey never used her staff to incapacitate someone at that distance with her staff; she always used it in a very in your face manner, the prime examples being the way she used it on Jakku against Finn and other scrappers.

Rey was able to initially beat Kylo Ren because he’d been shot, slashed, and had the extreme mental baggage of killing his father- and he was still able to nearly kill Finn, who did have martial training. 

Rey may not have trained with a saber, but she did know the tenants of close combat from her staff- and once again, Kylo Ren was incredibly injured. He was in no shape to be fighting.

Regardless of how late her heritage was revealed, Rey is a Palpatine; it explains her natural affinity to the Force. And how tf does Vader parallel to that?

In TFA, she only beats Kylo because of his extreme physical and mental deficiencies and even then is nearly beaten, but props to her for remaining balanced and in the light. The TLJ, she does lose, to Snoke; she’s mentally tortured and outmatched by someone faaaaar more powerful than her; it was only through some trickery on Kylo’s part that she lived, and again, this is due to an emotional/mental imbalance that Kylo suffered from. In the 9th episode, the final duel and moments of Kylo Ren show he is in fact the superior duelist, but again is thrown off balance by his Mother. No, Rey did not lose an arm take a physical injury, but she was tortured mentally, twice, by both supreme leaders of the 1st Order, and resisted the temptations of the Dark Side despite her having more reason than anyone to fall to it. The power level stuff is unconfirmed as of yet, but has strong evidence supporting it and the feats Rey performs. Oh, and she fucking dies in the 9th movie; the fact she lived is a OP part of Kylo Ren at that point if you’re really gonna say Rey is over powered; how would Ben have known how to save her if he was indeed a dark side user all those years?

In Legends continuity, Darth Sidious’s messing with midichlorians and misbalancing the Force in favor of the Dark Side is why Anakin was born; it has already been very heavily hinted that something very similar occurred in canon. this direct connection between Skywalker and Palpatine would probably persist in direct descendants, especially in lines as powerful as Palpatine and Skywalker. 

The idea of a fast learning extreme Force adept is not new either; Anakin is described as being held back due to his immense affinity in both Legends and canon, and is part of the reason he is so angry with the Jedi by episode 3. Luke is also trained to knight level in about 1 year, and didn’t know how to Force heal for the simple fact that Yoda probably wasn’t adept in teaching it; Luke only found the ancient texts detailing these techniques after Yoda’s death, and picked up on how to do it himself quickly as well, being able to teach Leia and, by extension, Rey. While this isn’t canon, it’s easy to infer that this is the case, based off the sources Rey has at her disposal in episode 9."

Rey: c. 20 years in miserable conditions as an underpaid, trapped scrapper on a planet as harsh as Tatooine, is thrown out of the blue into the next intergalactic conflict, still chooses the light side despite overwhelming odds and the immediate pain of losing the only father figure she’s ever known, finds the recluse who gave up on the galaxy after being a one shot wonder with saving the Galaxy, watches the cause she decided to help get very nearly destroyed entirely, still stays on the light side despite strong temptation and torture from the old and new Supreme Leaders, who she sees the good in when no one else would, spends an equal or lesser amount of time learning the Force as Luke did (guess who’s the only one vilified by the toxic ass sub) from Luke’s sister who is confirmed to have been trained fully in the Force (thus making sense how she learned all this), finds out her natural affinity to the dark side is because she’s the direct descendent of Sheev fucking Palpatine, STILL stays on the light side of the Force, turns Ben Solo back to the light, gives her life to channel the entirety of the Jedi against the entirety of the Sith, and then forges a new identity for herself, going on a journey of self discovery AFTER the galactic threat is finished, not before. 

Mary Sue my ass, I get not liking the 8th movie, I dislike it myself, but the 9th repaired a lot of what was wrong, while giving Rey a legitimate training time, at least as legitimate as Luke’s training was in the OT. No she didn’t lose a limb, boo- fucking hoo. Rey’s journey was much more based in the Force than any before her, and her trials showed this."

And Rojava is no success; it’s in the middle of a civil war and fucking ISIS; how the hell is that a point for communism? With the other two also springing up in Major wars of the 20th century and not outlasting them, your points are completely moot; these organizations are failures born of past failures."

Revolutionary Catalonia existed during the Spanish Civil War, and barely lasted 2 years, during which time, they employed scorched earth tactics on the region. And they were, again, anarchist, with attempted Soviet influences in communism. 

Are you seriously quoting a Syrian element here? I’d never even heard of them, and once again, they are anarcho-Libertarian; this is not the same as a collective communist society, this is lawlessness and a complete lack of government, not an equality based society. Your lack of understanding of that is concerning."
