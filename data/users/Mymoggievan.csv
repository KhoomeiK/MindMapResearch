Coronavirus,fffjvtt,t3_et9jkh,1579885539.0,I would be a little weary of the construction!
ResinCasting,ffcbia1,t1_ffbn8jt,1579795865.0,"I used concentric plastic cups, poured and briefly sanded to keep a nice circle as I went through the process.  Does that make sense?"
facepalm,ffatqum,t3_esdwta,1579744286.0,I remember my birthday always fell at the beginning of deer season. I would bring cupcakes for the classroom but almost no one was there (Wisconsin)
ResinCasting,ff6u1oh,t3_er7wig,1579634877.0,Very nice! You can also try to buff them with a Dremel or buffing lathe to make them more shiny (if that's a look you want). Bravo!!

ResinCasting,ff3ajuj,t1_ff2zgxq,1579537441.0,I hear you. Just keeping up a website is enough for me.
ResinCasting,ff1go7n,t3_eqzi51,1579478939.0,Are you mixing 50:50 by weight or by volume? And how much mica powder are you using?
ResinCasting,ff1gd3f,t3_er246l,1579478796.0,Fabulous! I have a lot to learn to get to this level! I assume you do this on a lathe. Do you have a YouTube where I can watch some of how you do this?
ResinCasting,ff18312,t3_eqxrl7,1579476140.0,I love it! The bow and the bead really set it off!
ResinCasting,ff17gag,t1_fewmuu9,1579476023.0,You'll be able to make beautiful art with those burls! I especially like spalted too.
ResinCasting,feyu3us,t1_fewmuu9,1579450535.0,"The pressure washing loosened the bark from underneath, allowing bark pieces to sort of 'break off' pretty easily. The finer tools are used to further expose the pins and clean the burl as best you can."
ResinCasting,fevhqyw,t1_feuxnlw,1579397615.0,Thank you!
ResinCasting,fevhptm,t1_fetsw27,1579397605.0,Thank you! it is a lot of fun to do.
ResinCasting,fevho3v,t1_fevag4h,1579397589.0,"I've been lucky enough to get burls that are dry. I got a new Eastern Maple burl that needed work. I pressure washed it to get most of the bark off, let it dry a few days, and then went at it with small metal brushes, an awl it the deep parts, and then used dental tools all to strip the bark and cambium. It isn't as bad as it sounds.  In fact I enjoyed it as I saw the lumps and bumps come out. Then I stabilize chunks of it in cactus juice.  Ready to slice! I don't know how to add a picture here but I have a couple. I would LOVE to get my hands on red oak burl! Did you buy it from a vendor?"
ResinCasting,feuoy0a,t1_feumuvk,1579388641.0,I used buckeye burl for this one.  It isn't dyed; the wood itself has so much character. I have more examples at kjpolyclay.com
ResinCasting,feua2xa,t3_eqkab0,1579384631.0,"First I stabilize the wood using Cactus Juice in a vacuum pot. I like to add dye to it to give the wood interesting colors. Then I glue gun my (sometimes embellished) wood pieces in a small paper food boat. I pour in dyed Art 'n Glow and use a vacuum pump and then a pressure pot to eliminate bubbles.  I then use a band saw to square up the piece.  I draw a design on it and cut it out with the band saw.  Then I sand and bevel the edges on a belt sander with the finest grit I can get away with.  Then hand sand at 220, 340, 400 dry.  Then 320, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 wet followed by the last 4 micro mesh wet.  Then I buff on a lathe or mandril."
ResinCasting,feu8e54,t3_eqm4gw,1579384157.0,"Edited due to problems uploading picture.  Also note that before I begin the process, I stabilize the wood in Cactus Juice, sometimes adding some dye to give the wood streaks of color."
ResinCasting,feu14dy,t3_eqm4gw,1579382110.0,Sorry pic didn't go the first time.  I'm new to reddit. I have more pics on my website kjpolyclay.com.
ResinCasting,fetomgu,t3_em2krn,1579377679.0,"I use a vacuum chamber with pump. I mix epoxy in a cup then put it in the vacuum pot till most of the big bubbles have risen to the top, then repeat if the cure time isn't imminent. Then I pour and use a heat gun in smooth passes.  Works pretty well."
ResinCasting,feto5cy,t3_ema8a6,1579377488.0,"My husband made me a wooden 'wrench' so I can be sure I get the wing nuts snug. I can send a pic if you PM me. Also be sure you tighten the nuts in cross-wise fashion: Snug the 12:00 nut, then the 6:00, then 3:00 and then 9:00. Then tighten in the same fashion. This helps keep even pressure on the gasket."
ResinCasting,fetl7et,t3_ep63e0,1579376487.0,"Check out Heath Knuckles youtube station.  He does this sort of thing, as well as Zac Higgins."
ResinCasting,fetjtk5,t3_ep3ubw,1579376122.0,Very cool! Where did you purchase the molds?
ResinCasting,fetap3g,t3_ephsu8,1579373400.0,Also beware of the amount of alcohol ink you add. I wanted a very deep color once so I added a lot. The acrylic never hardened. I also have good luck with Alumilite dyes. Only use a tiny bit; add it to a small container and then add what is needed to your casting resin. Good luck!
