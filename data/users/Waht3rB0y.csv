EarthPorn,ffih7lh,t1_ffi2lf6,1579973800.0,When I was a kid we lived in the country close to a creek. A couple times a season we’d get a thaw that overflowed the creek followed by a sharp freeze and it made to funnest skating trail. Me and my buddies would skate for a mile before turning around. It was great for tag too because the bushes and trees would be frozen along the sides making good cover to dart around or jump through.

My daughter and her friends are in competitive dance. They are incredibly talented but most of their epic photos are from snapping the shutter at just the right time.

Quite often that is while they are transitioning from their start position to what is in the photo and before they fall over or catch themselves. Statically holding a position is much much  more difficult.

This is a professional and she might be able to hold it for a bit but I doubt it’s for more than a second or two. Maybe a dancer will read this and confirm. But a lot of them develop issues from their art."

Lol ... she argued with the Queen over which tiara she would wear at her wedding. I’m pretty sure disrespecting the queen and royal protocols is sure to raise some eyebrows.

No one is obligated to like anyone else. Some people actually deserve the criticism they get. You can blame it on racism but there’s a whole lot of other reasons to like or not like someone. Sounds like she’s sleeping in a bed of her own making."

As well as the question as to who would be liable for security costs. There is absolutely a chance that we would be paying a significant amount for their security, all because Harry’s new wife doesn’t have the class and refinement to navigate the traditions and protocols of being a royal without offending the British. 

They turned against her because of her actions and behaviour and has had 3 royal staffers quit, some with long tenures of service to the institution. 

She has already stated her desire to go back to Los Angeles but doesn’t want to while Trump is President so Canada is just an intermediate stepping stone. So Canadian taxpayers are now going to have to pay for her political beliefs and posturing.

They should fund their Canadian adventure with their own money. I’d rather it go to the sick and elderly and those truly in need. However this is right in line with Trudeau’s celebrity seeking behaviour so he’s likely to write them a blank cheque just so he can get some selfies."

OntarioPolitics,fef5qp2,t1_fef5iog,1579048819.0,"I’m only speaking from my own experience and opinion so I appreciate that there are pros and cons to different teaching methods. I just wanted to comment from my own experience. Good teachers are invaluable for sure. But I’m open minded too. I really liked the flexibility with e-learning, as long as an instructor is still available for questions and support. Students exist on all parts of the bell curve so the delivery method needs to support all learners properly."
OntarioPolitics,fef4z5n,t1_feb5cjd,1579048301.0,"I’m a little skeptical as to how this is positioned. E-learning is projected to save $57M a year by 2027 according to this article. The cost of living increases and rollbacks to class size increases that the teachers union is fighting for is projected to be around $5-6B over the life of the contract. The difference between those two numbers makes fighting over e-learning hardly worth arguing over. No matter what side your on, it just doesn’t quite make sense. 

As a professional, most of our courses are now delivered via e-learning and they really are high quality. I prefer them over our instructor led courses because they are self paced and if you are interested in a specific thing, there’s enough time factored in so you can explore an area much more than if you have to keep pace with the rest of the class. And if you are faster OR slower, you can adjust your own pace as needed. I really liked the flexibility.

And it didn’t mean there wasn’t an instructor available to respond to questions, you just had to ping them on IM and they would start a video call with you to take and answer questions. 

I actually really like them and it’s the delivery method that most companies are using now. Is high school to young to introduce our young adults to thus delivery method? I don’t know but I personally am ok with trying.

Absolutely nothing to do with my opinion of teachers or their contracts. I just like it based on my learning style."

Reducing people’s opinions, no matter how well informed and nuanced they are, to a subreddit they have commented in, is the very definition of simple.

Keeping your mind in a box defined by a subreddit or political ideology means someone or something else is is defining your boundaries and telling you how or what to think. I’d rather be open minded and read a variety of schools of thought to challenge my own opinions. 

Ontario was a disaster under the NDP and I was around to experience that personally. They are a perennial third place party for good reasons. And the “Big Blue Machine” reigned in Ontario for over 4 decades winning 12 elections in a row.

There isn’t any kind of strategic benefit to Iran for this to be intentional. If anything, it’s the exact opposite as it’s taking the worlds focus away from Trump/Soleimani/strikes on Iraqi/US airbases and back onto Iran.

It was just a couple of days ago that Iran was reminding the US and the world about when the USS Vincennes shot down the Iranian airliner and they’ve now gone and done the same thing. 

I’m somewhat amazed that Iran didn’t temporarily close their airspace to commercial aviation after launching the rocket attacks on the Iraqi/US airbases.
