Eh evolution already does that on it's own. Want to improve the lives of humans as a whole? Go for interracial parings. Further intermingling of the races promotes the ""natural"" promotion of healthy genes without the dangerous eugenics route. Look at how low dementia is trending in Asian countries in [general](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/alzheimers-dementia/by-country/) and you'll see what I mean.

Even with your altruistic and optimistic thinking, I still wouldn't want humans to have such power. Even scientific minds can be swayed because of their biases.

First and foremost, yes, understanding does not mean condoning it however people already have a general idea that genetic manipulation does produce results. The problem with that is that, as you say, the problems come in when it becomes a matter of what to pick and choose and **who** gets to choose which you conveniently left out.


Why is the who important? Well who gets to decide? The parents? The **best case scenario** is that the parents just want the best kid (Eliminate and immunize from disease, best genes from both in terms of looks and intelligence and let all the other blocks fall where they do) however as you can see with the state of the world, the least common denominator is that people are at the least ignorant and at worst malicious. This opens the possibility of having ""Pug like"" humans where the ignorant makes ""the cutest"" babies or at worst the parents are racist and ask any ""African"" genes to be removed. 



Now let's say the government gets to decide for its populace. The same can be said but in a massively worse scale. Governments nowadays are not altruistic and even bastions of freedom and justice in the west have slipped towards a flavor of authoritarianism. The government, at that point, can systematically remove ""undesirables"" within generations. China would lap up the chance at having this kind of power and erase Uighurs from the planet and that's where /r/Scorch052's view of you condoning genocide comes from.


Honestly, your optimistic at best and uncaring at worst, view is unfortunately unrealistic.

If you really are an ""outsider"" then you're a bad faith outsider."

Everything you posted literally points to Climate Change being real but is a complicated mess that cannot be solved by simple solutions such as ditching straws. Also, how is having gender equality a bad thing? If you have any female associates, I'm deeply sorry for them.

I'm also sorry that you have the logical comprehension of a slug. My apologies."

First, you act as if it's **just** arsonists trying to prove that climate change is real by causing the AU fires then you move unto ""Well climate change is real but you're being lied to"" then move unto ""Well if you really cared about climate change then you gotta beat China""


Moving goalposts?"

False equivalency is **false**."
