Ironically, the description you gave lines up perfectly with the idea I'd been given be TV. It's just this gut feeling that another person completes you.

MinecraftMemes,ffe4qbx,t1_ffe2rc7,1579836651.0,">Minecraft at it's vanilla form, is supposed to be a simple game, you mine, you craft, you kill, etc, these actions should be simple.

Luckily they're letting us do just that. If the developers make a decision that is just *too* bad then you can play an earlier version of the game.

Have you been following along Jeb's unofficial combat updates? With each one he gets closer and closer to synthesizing the best parts of each system, and that simplicity aspect you just described is something Jeb very deliberately understands and keeps in mind at all times. It's not easy to perfect. It Takes time. But he'll get it eventually. The most recent one that made me think of this meme gets really close. You can see a more finalized combat system just on the horizon. It's not ridiculously unintuitive for new players. The sword is back to being the general ""good"" weapon, with the other weapons fulfilling niche roles. If you want it to be simple, then it can be. All you have to do is stabby with the sword. But the beauty of minecraft's simplicity is that it leaves potential for complexity, or else we wouldn't have computers or the mona lisa or the entire country of Denmark in minecraft. Jeb's changes seek to put that idea into the combat system as well. I might be proven wrong. The final product might turn out to be an over complicated mess, but what we've seen so far is very promising. And this has been in production for *4 years.* All the time didn't go into nothing."

Important doesn't have to be a major plot point. Most people will see it and make it fit the narrative they've built in their head, which, as you pointed out, is most likely that living underground your whole life affects your skin color.

Exactly. You were thinking about it because you already knew it was important. Most people fall into the line of reasoning of ""it's because she's from a burrow,"" and My title doesn't contradict that at all. Being from a burrow was supposed to be a secret. It doesn't seem ""important"" in relation to kipo being s half mute, but from the perspective of a viewer who hasn't seen much, a character referring to kipo's skin as important would most reasonably be talking about kipo being from a burrow. If you had seen, say, up to the first interaction with the main frog character, who didn't immediately realize kipo was from a burrow, the sarcasm of my title would serve that narrative perfectly. It doesn't suggest any more significance than anyone would already have come to expect."
KipoAndTheAgeOfWB,ffb9k0d,t1_ffb7cwk,1579756240.0,"I think the fact her skin is purple sort of gives that away. It's plausible that everyone has purple skin until we see wolf, who shows up less than 10 minutes into the first episode. No one has that much suspension of disbelief.

Also this community isn't really big enough that anyone would be browsing this sub without having watched the show. Even if my title did give something away, who would see it?

It kind of takes paragraphs and paragraphs to properly explain what events lead to the civil war, and nobody wants to do that in their spare time. It's kind of frustrating to watch you get shot down over and over because of small individual details and semantics. The people downvoting you(because of your opinion and not because of your contribution to the discussion, which I have to add, is not what the downvote is for) don't even seem to disagree with you. You just clarify details like the purpose of the emancipation proclamation that feel vaguely problematic when they don't come from a teacher even though they aren't.

To say slavery was one of the main causes of the civil war feels slightly wrong. It's more like there were a bunch of reasons for the civil war and slavery was at the forefront of all of them. The south wanted to preserve and expand slavery, and the North wanted to prevent the expansion of slavery. We have Harriet Tubman, a legendary conductor who made the south feel like slavery was at risk. We have bleeding Kansas. If people didn't care deeply about slavery, then when the Kansas-Nebraska act was passed, people wouldn't have flocked there in order to change the vote. There would not have been any riots. Abraham Lincoln probably wouldn't have come out of retirement.  We have Uncle tom's cabin, the book that became a cultural phenomenon and one of the big reason any northerners cared about slaver at all. I think any of this context would have made this debate way more productive, rather than just a bunch of people who think you think the civil war was not about slavery and you clarifying that it was for the south and it only became about slavery for the north later. Over and over."

A small percent of the South owned more than 100 slaves, and these people, the planter class, controlled most of the wealth. These were the people who wanted to preserve slavery the most.
