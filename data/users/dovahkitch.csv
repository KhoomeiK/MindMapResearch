Lentils are rich in protein and iron, green peas and beans are definitely on the list. As for iron I make sure I eat spinach and mushrooms once a week as well. For added protein, say I'm eating pasta with mushrooms or a spinach risotto, I'll use nutritional yeast. It's great, good flavor, can use it on anything (sprinkle it on veggies, pasta, baked potatoes...) and I bought a bag on Amazon for 13 and it's lasting me an eternity."

Ha un odore neutro, tutti gli altri mi danno fastidio nel senso che mi sanno di ""acido"" o hanno un odore troppo forte. Io sudo poco e niente quindi l'odore  l'unica discriminante.

 Crema per capelli ricci assolutamente sunsilk.  difficile trovare prodotti per capelli ricci che ti danno il risultato desiderato ma questa crema da anni mi lascia soddisfatta, qualsiasi altra marca che ho provato mi ha seccato i capelli o semplicemente non mi ha lasciata soddisfatta, compresi prodotti comprati direttamente dal parrucchiere.


Lysoform spray disinfettante per la casa e disinfettante per pavimenti: non sono fissata particolarmente per la pulizia. Ci tengo si ma il mio primo pensiero  la disinfezione delle superfici. Lysoform ha un odore non forte quanto la candeggina che mi da abbastanza fastidio per ha un'azione disinfettante che  l'unica cosa che  davvero importante per me.

Per necessit mi rendo conto che compro molto Schar che ha una grandissima linea senza glutine. Faccio spesa coi buoni per la celiachia e il supermercato che li accetta ha un sacco di cose Schar. Non tutto  buono, certe cose sono orribili per ormai ho trovato svariate cose che mi piacciono e torno sempre a comprarle. Ovviamente insieme ad altre marche che per non sono necessariamente sempre le stesse.

Inchiostri per tatuaggi assolutamente e mai cambier: World famous per i colorati e Panthera per il nero. Il nero  il pi bello che io abbia mai visto, la consistenza  ottima e il risultato ancora meglio. Nero solido e saturo, non sbiadisce, non diventa bluastro e dura negli anni. Chiunque abbia tatuato  rimasto soddisfatto del nero. World Famous ha una gamma di colori infinita, ogni volta che devo ordinare mi perdo: vuoi un verde? Ne abbiamo 45 e sono tutti bellissimi. I colori sono vibranti e rimangono tali sulla pelle, belli decisi e mantengono nel tempo. Li ho anche io addosso e sono felicissima di averli. Uso solo nero e rosso quando tatuo per sono talmente innamorata del rosso che ho che cerco di metterne un po' in ogni tatuaggio!"

Lately I've been in and out of hospitals trying to figure out what's wrong with me and I've been treated badly many more times than I've been treated good or simply listened to. Still, I know there are good nurses and doctors out there and I know 5 minutes of their lives can save a whole ass life.

Edit: the more I think about it, the more Im sorry for the family of weirdos this dog found herself in. When she's not supposed to do something I can stop her by saying ""no"" or just clearing my throat in a way that she understands it means no.

I also taught her to react a certain way to certain words. When she wants food or water or to go out, she'll cry but you don't know what she wants, right? So I ask her ""food? Water? Walk?"" and I can tell what she wants by the way she tilts her head. She knows what I'm doing though so she will sit and face me to make me understand what she needs."

Just your regular lasagna but I use a blender to give tofu kinda the consistency of ground beef and cook it with tomato sauce with some spices. Then as you regularly would, lasagna sheet, sauce and mozzarella and so on. My gf likes boiled eggs in her lasagna (to each their own I guess? Haha) and sprinkle parmesan on top. Cook it and then cut it up and freeze it in single portions. Defrost in the oven when you need it an voila!

One thing I do often is cook zucchini or eggplant and blend them so that I have a sauce to defrost and put on pasta. I beat the hell out of a handful of cashews to sprinkle on top to finish (I'm going more on the vegan side as of lately but I used to put parmesan).

Or instead of blending, just freeze them chopped up and cooked. Also bell peppers! And lentils, why not. I don't do it with beans and chickpeas only because I buy them in a can, already steamed and they last an eternity. Same thing, lentil burgers.

This way I only buy a ton of things once a week and then use the frozen things I have + fresh fruit and veggies like salad or a cucumber or carrots. Cook pasta, rice or throw a potato in the oven for a complete meal!

Still, if I can't calm her down for 5 minutes, I can't complain too much. It's just a dog barking and that's what dogs do, you can't help it in any way, again, if you don't want noise, you don't get a dog. I think I came off as too harsh in my reply. What I'm saying is you guys should totally sit down and talk about the issue since you're living so close to each other.

If you take a good look at the Bible, the hystorical period and the translation errors, most of what's written on it makes sense. I'm not perfectly sure about everything but I think there's something about not drinking alcohol / eating meats that are too hard to digest. That's because in that climate, those things were not great for you, therefore it makes total sense.

As far as translation errors go, I remember we had a couple of lectures in university about that, where the professor told us we were not evened scratching the surface of the problem. A book that is hand written and passed on for years *will* have so many mistakes it's crazy.

I had to go to the er because of the swollen hand, it was tingling and kept on swelling but it was just the hand that the puppies bit on, the other one was normal. I'm pretty confused. The dog is not ours, we're just fostering her so she's already in a program that is searching for a home for her so she will be well taken care of no matter what. I would still be pretty devastated if she left because we fell in love with her but not breathing is not an option. These weeks have been hell for me.

I also want to add: my girlfriend has a dog at her dad's and he spent a couple of nights with us previously but I didn't have any problems.

Keep your hair up whenever you can, even if your hair is clean, it collects dirt all over. If you can't keep an updo, try to have your hair as clean as possible, also don't touch your hair too much since it collects dirt from your hands. Don't sleep on it, don't stress it, don't move it. If you want a life changing suggestion: travel pillow! It's comfy while not putting the weight of your head on the piercing. When you're sure that it healed and it doesn't hurt anymore/the bump is gone, keep it clean and do your aftercare routine for another additional 2 weeks to a month.

Ha un odore neutro, tutti gli altri mi danno fastidio nel senso che mi sanno di ""acido"" o hanno un odore troppo forte. Io sudo poco e niente quindi l'odore è l'unica discriminante.

 Crema per capelli ricci assolutamente sunsilk. È difficile trovare prodotti per capelli ricci che ti danno il risultato desiderato ma questa crema da anni mi lascia soddisfatta, qualsiasi altra marca che ho provato mi ha seccato i capelli o semplicemente non mi ha lasciata soddisfatta, compresi prodotti comprati direttamente dal parrucchiere.


Lysoform spray disinfettante per la casa e disinfettante per pavimenti: non sono fissata particolarmente per la pulizia. Ci tengo si ma il mio primo pensiero è la disinfezione delle superfici. Lysoform ha un odore non forte quanto la candeggina che mi da abbastanza fastidio però ha un'azione disinfettante che è l'unica cosa che è davvero importante per me.

Per necessità mi rendo conto che compro molto Schar che ha una grandissima linea senza glutine. Faccio spesa coi buoni per la celiachia e il supermercato che li accetta ha un sacco di cose Schar. Non tutto è buono, certe cose sono orribili però ormai ho trovato svariate cose che mi piacciono e torno sempre a comprarle. Ovviamente insieme ad altre marche che però non sono necessariamente sempre le stesse.

Inchiostri per tatuaggi assolutamente e mai cambierò: World famous per i colorati e Panthera per il nero. Il nero è il più bello che io abbia mai visto, la consistenza è ottima e il risultato ancora meglio. Nero solido e saturo, non sbiadisce, non diventa bluastro e dura negli anni. Chiunque abbia tatuato è rimasto soddisfatto del nero. World Famous ha una gamma di colori infinita, ogni volta che devo ordinare mi perdo: vuoi un verde? Ne abbiamo 45 e sono tutti bellissimi. I colori sono vibranti e rimangono tali sulla pelle, belli decisi e mantengono nel tempo. Li ho anche io addosso e sono felicissima di averli. Uso solo nero e rosso quando tatuo però sono talmente innamorata del rosso che ho che cerco di metterne un po' in ogni tatuaggio!"

Cook it and then cut it up and freeze it in single portions. Defrost in the oven when you need it an voila!

One thing I do often is cook zucchini or eggplant and blend them so that I have a sauce to defrost and put on pasta. I beat the hell out of a handful of cashews to sprinkle on top to finish (I'm going more on the vegan side as of lately but I used to put parmesan).

Or instead of blending, just freeze them chopped up and cooked. Also bell peppers! And lentils, why not. I don't do it with beans and chickpeas only because I buy them in a can, already steamed and they last an eternity. Same thing, lentil burgers.

This way I only buy a ton of things once a week and then use the frozen things I have + fresh fruit and veggies like salad or a cucumber or carrots. Cook pasta, rice or throw a potato in the oven for a complete meal!

A dog left out in the cold, I don't know, as you describe it, those dogs could use some more love for sure. Me personally, I wouldn't leave a dog outside alone all day under the weather.

Still, if I can't calm her down for 5 minutes, I can't complain too much. It's just a dog barking and that's what dogs do, you can't help it in any way, again, if you don't want noise, you don't get a dog. I think I came off as too harsh in my reply. What I'm saying is you guys should totally sit down and talk about the issue since you're living so close to each other. Also I hope it goes without saying that if those dogs live in an unhealthy environment or are mistreated you should totally call the authorities and give them a chance to live a happy life like every animal on earth deserves."

I'm not perfectly sure about everything but I think there's something about not drinking alcohol / eating meats that are too hard to digest. That's because in that climate, those things were not great for you, therefore it makes total sense.

As far as translation errors go, I remember we had a couple of lectures in university about that, where the professor told us we were not evened scratching the surface of the problem. A book that is hand written and passed on for years *will* have so many mistakes it's crazy.

I had to go to the er because of the swollen hand, it was tingling and kept on swelling but it was just the hand that the puppies bit on, the other one was normal. I'm pretty confused. The dog is not ours, we're just fostering her so she's already in a program that is searching for a home for her so she will be well taken care of no matter what. I would still be pretty devastated if she left because we fell in love with her but not breathing is not an option. These weeks have been hell for me.

I also want to add: my girlfriend has a dog at her dad's and he spent a couple of nights with us previously but I didn't have any problems.

Keep your hair up whenever you can, even if your hair is clean, it collects dirt all over. If you can't keep an updo, try to have your hair as clean as possible, also don't touch your hair too much since it collects dirt from your hands. Don't sleep on it, don't stress it, don't move it. If you want a life changing suggestion: travel pillow! It's comfy while not putting the weight of your head on the piercing. When you're sure that it healed and it doesn't hurt anymore/the bump is gone, keep it clean and do your aftercare routine for another additional 2 weeks to a month. Everything should get back to normal in a month."

It helps me so much, and it's also so much money I can buy pasta, bread and anything else for two people every month and nothing ever is missing. The only down side is that particularly here as I said, being a small town, you don't get a lot of variety and sometimes things are missing but honestly... I saved so much money I'm speechless. GF costs a lot more than normal and having it for free is something I'll be forever grateful for."
vegan,fcxwdyr,t1_fcxupxe,1578071404.0,"Honestly I have a coupon that the state gives you when you have celiacs that gives you an amount of money to spend in any store that accepts it. Now, in this very small town there's only one store and not always I buy the same brand because sometimes they have a certain one, the next week is gone. I get the struggle though, sometimes I buy flatbread instead or just rice cakes, which are my absolute go to. I buy like 10 packs a month or more if I can't find bread. So I don't have a go to brand, I just go in and hope they have something for me lol"

We're engaged, i could never even imagine to be without her now. Still, life is crazy sometimes so never say never."
