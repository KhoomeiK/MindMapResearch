Baker is still amazing but there are other amazing mountains in the west. I'm at Schweitzer this season. Better fall lines and it's awesome having an actual ski bum town near by. On a bunch of Baker runs, you have to ride through garbage to get to the goods, or ride out of some garbage after the goods. It has the goods though. Schweitzer isn't as extreme, their food isn't as good or tickets as cheap, but the trees and fall lines make up for it. Go explore the west!"
