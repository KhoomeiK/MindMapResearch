The school is absolutely awful in either case and the girl better off out of there in either case. But I do wonder whether this isn't a news story about a school overreacting to a meaningless sweater but rather finding tangential ways to deal with students they have already identified. Just as they agreed to let her have ""voluntary withdrawal,"" rather than exclusion on her records. Because dishonesty and deceit is part of the school's Christian values."
