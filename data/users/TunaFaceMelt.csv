offset,ff3b177,t1_ff2lynn,1579537683.0,The Epiphone on the far right is an Epiphone Inspired by 1966 Century Archtop. Thinline full hollowbody. It's a blast to play both acoustically and plugged in. The p90 on it is phenomenal. I'm convinced it's all you need for any type of music.

Whatever is making the sound has to have extremely powerful lungs, the echo implies it's a long ways away from the person taking the video. I'm sure not a canine expert by any means but I just can't imagine any kind of dog or wolf making this sound."

They are full on RPG so I'm not sure if that's exactly what you're after. Long story lines, multiple paths to any objective: stealth or full-on rampage and anything in between, complex leveling up trees to customize to your play style, planning out how you will complete each task, dying a lot if you fail, etc. I freaking love it."

pelletgrills,fcvfu4l,t1_fcvel82,1578001208.0,"Oh man it was so easy. I got just one of your standard Fred Meyer Private Selection spiral cut hams, it came with the glaze. I started with it on the smoker cut-side down at 275° until it got to about 70° internal temp took maybe an hour or so. At that point it started getting nice and crispy brown on the edges and smelling like heaven-bacon. Then I transferred to a foil pan on its side, and poured the glaze over the top to let it sink down in between the slices. Put it back on for about another 30 mins like that, basting that sweet glaze and ham drippings over the top of it every 10 mins or so. At about 90° internal temp I cranked the smoker up to 350° until it got to 120° internal, continuing to baste every 15 mins or so. All said and done it took about 2.5 hours total. It was like freaking meat candy. I can't wait to make split pea soup out of that smoked hock."

pelletgrills,fc0pcms,t1_fc06bny,1577296464.0,I went by internal temp primarily but planned for it to be a much longer smoke than it actually ended up being so I reduced the temp for the last few hours to prolong the cooking. I had guests coming over for dinner and the butt was about to be done at 8 am. I am used to a much less efficient smoker and put the butt on to smoke the night before at about 11 pm so all in all it was a learning experience.
