youtubers,fdrb11d,t3_emu7bz,1578681973.0,"I feel like that IS racist, but racist to those white folk.

I'm beginning to think that racism is being kept alive by comments like these. Once we stop looking at skin color, racism dies out. 

Isn't the racism that was alive hundreds and hundreds of years ago no longer around because no one points it out? I can't remember the last time someone called someone else a Saxon or jutes or youn.
