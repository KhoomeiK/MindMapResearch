Going into BWL/ZG/AQ, 90% of guilds in Vanilla didn't get all world buffs, still had pallys in full plate, still had shaman and druids in full mail/leather.

You are trying to assert the game doesn't allow for outside the box thinking and then **literally the next post** acknowledge that it took over a year before even the top guilds started putting leather on DPS.

You implied that the meta **now** undermines the other guy's points.

I reminded you that the game is 15 years old and when it came out and for many, many years afterwards, the vast majority of people did not play under this meta, and thus the game was a puzzle to be figured out and allowed for many outside-of-the-box playstyles and theorizing.
