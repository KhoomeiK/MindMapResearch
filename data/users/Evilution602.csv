Other than that its a massive drain on our economy and a major reason we low and middle class people no longer have any sort of wealth to pass on. Its all funneled into end of life care."

Its prescribed by my doctor, and ultimately its best for both of us that im a little high through the day.

""Its easier to ask for forgiveness than permission"" is something I kinda live by.

We use these. They have thicker soles and are built a little better than the sock type. Plus she actually lets me put these on her feetsies. I also make her wear a backpack to haul her own water and a collapsible dish 

I would recommend these for hiking all year simply because pulling cactus out of puppy paws sucks. And it makes me feel like i failed her

Also they protect the feet in the summer from our crazy heat,"
