Foodforthought,ff6fxb0,t3_erdrcv,1579626335.0,"As a white person I cannot say what life is like as a black person, however from reading this article there seems to be a strong disconnect from what the author thinks white people think and what white people are actually thinking. I really have a hard time believing that there are tens of millions of racists running around trying to spread a grand conspiracy against minorities and that wish for a return of a pre civil war south. While there are some I really don't think most whites voted for Trump simply out of racism. From what I have heard from many of my friends who supported Trump (and yes I will admit they are all white) is that they do not have the opportunity to work hard and get ahead in life like many people did a few decades ago and this can be attributied to many factors (many weak unions and globalization taking away many blue collar jobs). Wealth in the country is concentrated on top a Trump supporters know this which is why he was so popular in rural industrial towns because he made a promise (likely a false one that cannot be fulfilled) that he could give them back the wealth that they had earned."

trashy,fcstuqi,t1_fcsotux,1577924960.0,You can ride them on bike lanes but our city has none
AskReddit,fcsm7j7,t3_eilzj5,1577919518.0,You can use your imagination
trashy,fcsjb1u,t1_fcsh9kp,1577917683.0,Yeah I tried it once and it was fun but man there was no where to ride. It was either in the street with aggressive city drivers or over people on sidewalks. Also people ride with those things with their kids on the same scooter and your not just endangering yourself and other around you but your kid too. While I agree more bike lanes would be nice these things are not good for anyone.
trashy,fcry26t,t3_eilabt,1577908189.0,As someone who lives in a city with those things I'm fine with the idea of throwing them in a river

Foodforthought,fcl1mru,t1_fck2iyw,1577737851.0,While that is true I would say however that while he may not believe in the interests of those groups you do have to give Trump and the GOP the credit of at least knowing who to target and how to target them. The fact still remains there is very little effort put in by the left to win over these voters
AskReddit,fcjcwqy,t1_fcil5bc,1577683338.0,"I know this might be a little gross but holding hands while you are walking around with no where to really go as you are exploring a new area. It's  warm out and she has on a nice red sundress and you are cracking jokes and laughing as you walk. She looks at you and smiles and you smile to and then you slow down and she pulls your arm closer and leans into your shoulder and looks up at you and you see the whole world in her eyes. You think that this must be true love and you decide that this is the one.

Then you go to the bedroom and throw down with some BDSM shit or something."
Foodforthought,fcjaubv,t1_fciv60r,1577681638.0,But there is a point to be made that the left did not appeal to the states that were needed to go blue in order for them to win. It's no secret that elections are won in a few states and Trump did connect with voters in the states that mattered.
