The total length is now 105,000 minutes, or 1,750 hours.

A more accurate number can be gotten by counting her steps in each episode, starting with the first episode and watching every episode following that one. You can also get a more accurate stride length by comparing hers to the tiles she stands in front of. You must do this for each step, otherwise the result is not as accurate.

It would be more likely for the republican-controlled Senate to overturn an executive order of this nature, but I do not think that is likely either (given how loyal the current Senate is to Trump).
