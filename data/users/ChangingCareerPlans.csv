insaneparents,fgu29i8,t3_f0de36,1581112435.0,I just got back from the doctor’s and I have the flu. How could any adult think this is okay to do to their kid?! I’d do anything to give that boy my tamiflu
offmychest,fgt9ezy,t1_fgt3gk7,1581101282.0,"I completely agree. Even when everything is done correctly, birth control can still fail. I don’t think it’s fair to ruin peoples lives and even risk their lives because they simply got unlucky. I support a lot of things like improving the accessibility to low income maternal care and things like that because I want those that do decide to keep it to have adequate resources to raise a child. I believe that children should be a gift, I don’t like that these people want it to be a punishment. 

I’ve spoken to two friends, one of them came to me and said she was pregnant and needed to abort immediately, she was in a complete panic. I told her I wanted her to sit down and think about it for a few days because it’s an important decision. She ended up figuring out a way to have the baby and stay in college. The second friend came and said I’m pregnant and I need an abortion, I’ve thought about it and this must be done. Her parents did not allow it and as much as she loves that kid, he completely ruined her life and she is not afraid to say it. She will always be in poverty. Last year she got her GED at age 22. She had great grades and wanted to be a marine biologist. Being pregnant also made her pretty sick and she ended up with postpartum depression for a while. I’ve seen the two sides of the coin. Nobody deserves to suffer for the rest of their life because she missed a birth control pill. Likewise nobody should feel pressured to abort out of shame. Both of these women were affected by the rhetoric of the no choice side. This is what disgusts me, if people could  mind their own business than women’s lives would be so much better"
OccupationalTherapy,fgsyqpv,t3_f0c7u9,1581095438.0,"all women OTs want to work with kids. People in the industry have tried pushing me that direction for years. I gave it a dedicated try and absolutely hated it. Nothing against female peds, it’s just not a good fit for me. I like the challenge of an ornery old person."

offmychest,fgsvzec,t1_fgsuor1,1581093798.0,what did I say above concerning your response? Listen next time

offmychest,fgsnbxm,t1_fgsmutp,1581088480.0,"I’m stuck here until I graduate. I knew this place wasn’t for me when they decided to do open carry and I started seeing people with guns in Walmart and trump stickers. This has just only reinforced how badly I need to get the hell out of here as soon as I can. The Bible belt simply is not a safe place for me to be, I’m LGBTQ to make it even worse. How long before they go for the trifecta? Some will say I’m exaggerating but can you imagine ever feeling this way? Waking up every day to check the news because you’re not sure how long you’re going to be legally protected? I was going to stay and save up some money before I went back to California but there is no way I’m doing that now."
offmychest,fgsn9jz,t1_fgsmred,1581088438.0,"I already do. Birth control and a condom every single time always without a moment of hesitance. I haven’t had sex in about six years but now if I ever want to, I have to consider the thousands of dollars it will take for me to fly back to my hometown in case something goes wrong. Even if this bill was only introduced, my right to feel safe and equal has been compromised. This is not OK either way"

TIHI,fgqz8gm,t3_eztacx,1581034668.0,"she had hepatitis, and let’s be real here for a minute. Who among us wouldn’t have doubt that this guy understands consent? Especially after the loss of innocence during their own sexual assault. She loved Forest but I think she didn’t know what to do with those feelings. And now to make it worse imagine giving into those feelings and ending up having his child. Would you really be thinking oh wow now we can have a happy ending or would you be thinking Jesus Christ did I rape a guy? We are conditioned to root for romance in movies but just picture how this would go in real life."
insaneparents,fgqplym,t3_ezvxnq,1581028827.0,I’m confused by the people that said this is not insane. Could one of you please explain because this is pretty insane to me
DiWHY,fgp27w9,t1_fgoeb39,1580994806.0,Just when I thought there was hope that nobody could be this dumb. If you zoom in on the picture it really does look like crumbs which is why I’m  suspicious
