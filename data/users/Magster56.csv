ToolBand,felxf7m,t3_epul36,1579233366.0,"If you receive a request for 3 tickets, I’ll gladly be the 4th.  I’m 100% good for it.  My son’s favorite band was Tool.  He never got to see them.  He passed away almost 7 years ago, and I want to go to honor him.  I live in LV, and I’ll be able to go early to get in the merchandise line before everything sells out.  Crossing my fingers.  I went to the MGM Tuesday night and they told me that tickets were sold out.  I was going to try again tomorrow.  I could find someone for the second ticket, but my budget is limited."
