Sorry that my source doesn't list those who are deceased. But you can go through the list and find that they're all alive except Chamberlain and Malone. Bob Pettit got the first one. He is 87. Bob Cousy is 91. Bill Russell: 85. Oscar Robertson is 81. Several are in their 70s.

politics,ff83n90,t1_ff77w7r,1579665115.0,"Our system of media (including the diffuse nature of the internet and the general fragmentation of information sources) is not equipped to serve the function it's supposed to serve in a democracy. That is a basic, unavoidable fact right now.

When a political party can lie to this extent and face almost zero accountability from so many voters, that's not (as some people like to suggest) a problem in which Democrats are ineffectual and incompetent. And it's not (again, contrary to popular opinion) that the people working in media are doing a bad job.

No, it's a structural problem, which means it's a problem deeply rooted in factors out of anyone's control. And specifically that problem is, again, with the basic inability of our media system to provide its 4 basic function for democracy: (1) to be a watchdog, (2) to provide people with (true) information, (3) to give a voice to all perspectives, (4) to provide platforms for all of those voices to be adequately heard. These are the problems wrought by the fragmented system of media that is largely the product of new media technologies developed over the past 40 years, and especially over the past 20 years and then how people have figured out how to manipulate people using these technologies for only the past 5 years. 

Yes, we are just fine on the 3rd function of media I list -- giving a voice. But the other 3 are not being fulfilled. Professional journalism is not funded well enough today to adequately be a fully effective watchdog. Information is corrupted by rampant false information, and we don't have adequate mediums for allowing the truth to be heard.

Eventually, perhaps, we will figure it out. But right now, as long as we have these structural problems without proper safeguards to ensure better distribution of true information and protections against the spread of false information, we all suffer as our election choices cannot be truly democratic."
politics,ff7a6d4,t1_ff5ohb1,1579644389.0,">  Why do you assume the results of that push/pull is going to result in Bernie not getting his agenda passed, rather than Bernie getting a better deal, due to his strong starting negotiating position, and his grassroots movement also creating pressure from the outside?

Well, I don't exactly ""assume"" it. I'm trying to have an honest political discussion. And I'm suggesting my prediction of what I think will happen based on the history of seeing more radical ideas being very, very difficult to make into policy.

To start to make my point, I'm reminded here that people forget that Hillary Clinton literally tried took a leadership role in trying to get universal healthcare passed in the **early 1990s** while she was the First Lady. It failed spectacularly and is cited as a major reason BIll Clinton lost Congress and was unable to get a lot of things done. This story reminds us of a few things that are relevant here:

1) One, Hillary has been turned into a more moderate politician by the process -- by her experience being unable to get more transformative progressive ideas implemented.

2) Two, Hillary is thusly viewed as a moderate shill -- practically a Republican -- by so many progressives who either refuse to understand why she is as moderate as she is or don't understand because they haven't been presented that information.

3) But also, thirdly, the point I'm trying to make is not about defending Hillary -- the point is about understanding why things are the way they are -- why so many Democrats seem like such disappointments today. It's because the process has pushed them in that direction -- not because their first instinct is to be so moderate.

4) Further, many of candidates who you would like have lost and are now forgotten. They are out of political leadership because voters in the past have tended to prefer more moderate leaders. To put it another way, Bernie's style of uncompromising progressivism is so rare today because it has nearly died of failure.

And so the idea I'm trying to convey here is to say OK, I know we need very serious changes, very big changes, but I want to support the candidate who will (A) actually be focused on making big changes but also (B) who I think has the best chance of actually getting their big ideas implemented.

5) So finally, I am going to guess that you're thinking something along the lines of ""But ***THIS*** is the problem!! This is why everything sucks, because Democrats are so feckless!!! This is why we need Bernie!!!!""

And there may not be a way to convince you to think any differently, but I think my major point is to at least get you to try to step outside of the Bernie bubble and understand why things are the way they are -- that the way politics and our economy and healthcare are is not just because Democrats suck and we need a revolutionary to fix it. Rather, it's because of a deeply entrenched system, and it's because voters (your fellow Americans) mostly don't think like you, and it's because Republicans are very manipulative and have managed to convince middle class people to vote against their interests, to vote for Republican policies that only help about 10% of the population.

And then, it only helps Republicans when people come along and say that Democrats and Republicans are equally to blame for why everything sucks now, an opinion which simply fails to understand the success of Republicans at manipulating the process through clever fear and lying.

By believing that Bernie is some kind of savior who can come in and fix the terrible problem that Democrats are creating, you are pushing the narrative that helps Republicans.

To put it another way, you're playing the short game, not the long game. Maybe Bernie can even win in 2020 (and I will vote for him if he's the nominee, by the way), but the evidence I see says he's not a coalition builder, he's not a guy trying to fix things realistically within the system. He's trying to break the system and restart it from scratch, which will take years to even attempt to accomplish and may not happen. The alternative (represented by Liz Warren) is trying an approach that works within the existing system, identifies a realistic transition plan, has a more realistic chance of gaining supporters in Congress, etc....

So I'm not saying that tension will be inherently productive. I'm saying that Bernie and Liz would both create tension but it seems to me like Liz has a better plan to actually produce results from that tension.

So many candidates today seem not committed to big changes -- they seem to be underestimating the gravity of our problems and the changes that need to be made -- especially when it comes to things like economics, healthcare coverage, and our primary energy sources. These people pushing not-strong-enough changes are, I think, candidates like Biden and Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Bloomberg and Steyer. The ones pushing actual big changes are Bernie and Warren and to a lesser extent, Yang. Yang's problem though, I think, is that I don't think the big changes he is focused on are the right changes for this moment. So I'll dismiss him as being the best choice and say that it's either Bernie or Liz or who the right idea about the need for big changes.

And then I'll go with Liz Warren because, as I've said, she's got a similar agenda as Bernie but she has plans that are more likely to be successfully implemented (because she'll get more cooperation from Congress, more appealing to a wider spectrum of voters, and because they are designed to work within the confines of our existing system -- as opposed to Bernie, who I see as less likely to gain cooperation from Congress, more easily painted as too radical (which could lead to backlash from voters scared of his policies, and then Democrats lose Congress), and because his policies require blowing up the existing system with no compromise and no transition plan."

But that's not the only risk. Bernie appears to be wanting to do things that are likely to get push back from even Democrats, making it seem even less likely his agenda can get passed. And again, I see Warren as more likely to be able to gain cooperation from her peers in Congress and to create a coalition to hold and even gain seats in Congress."
politics,ff33fhw,t1_ff2o2tr,1579532678.0,"My biggest concern with Bernie is not about whether he will work with March McConnell and the Republicans.

politics,ff2jpjv,t1_ff2i561,1579509233.0,"I agree.

While Warren wants to work within our system, break it down from the inside, and cooperate more with other people already in government.

I think you are misjudging why some people don't think Bernie is the best candidate. You can disagree with the assessment, but a lot of people are concerned about data showing that a Bernie candidacy (and possible win) would (compared to Biden or Warren) lead to a large wave of Republican victories in Congress. And if that happens, Bernie becomes unable to enact his agenda.

My view is that Warren would do most everything Bernie wants to do but she's better at working within the confines of our political system.

Again, I don't suspect you're going to agree with any of this but speaking for myself, wealth inequality is the number one issue and I'm just very concerned that Sanders is going to cause a massive blowback of anti-socialist voting."
politics,fegx33k,t1_fegml92,1579104468.0,"So I guess you have an understanding of American democracy as a dictatorship, where the president does whatever he wants and Congress has no power to obstruct? And that a decision by a president can't be ruined by a successor?

As far as NAFTA and banking... It was reasonable for Clinton to think NAFTA could be a good deal at the time. The idea of expanding trade opportunities was inevitable. Complaining about how it hasn't worked out great is not the same thing as saying Clinton somehow deliberately sold out the public. If other policies were properly enforced to reign in wealth inequality and other issues -- like tax policy or anti-trust policies -- then NAFTA would be working better. But one policy succeeding relies on other policies being sought and enforced.

With Obama and banking, did you not understand the problem of Too Big To Fail? The very idea was that before Obama was president, power in our banking system was excessively concentrated to small number of banks. If Obama lets them fail, the entire American economy crashes and the results are a much bigger disaster than we had. He had no good choices and the least worst choice was to bail them out.

AskReddit,fck3plo,t1_fcjgflp,1577715672.0,Did they tell you if it made sense that you would be able to physically feel/sense that you had blood clots? Or would it be more of a mystical thing with no good explanation for why you'd be able to feel that?
meirl,fcic3df,t1_fch7j84,1577660356.0,Interesting. I generally don't double on anything other than 10 or 11 but have seen others do it for less and that made me think it was maybe a good idea. I guess maybe my instinct was right on this one.
meirl,fch1dxg,t1_fcgnplw,1577646300.0,It's not super uncommon to see people double down on just about anything 11 or less (or anything with an ace) if the dealer has like 5 or 6 showing. You think of it as a high probability of a dealer bust and a good opportunity to double your money.
sports,fcgnae7,t1_fcgiev5,1577641958.0,"You say what he ""generally"" did, and then you send me a single video of one time he scored and his teammates were all around him?

I don't think this is how it usually was. I think he usually did it in the endzone."
sports,fcggmuw,t1_fcgf3fp,1577639727.0,"Absolutely it was more demonstrative. For one, in context, you knew he was super religious so you knew he was kneeling to pray and it just reinforced his extreme religiosity. Second, he would kneel for several seconds, versus a point to the sky which is like half a second.

The religion itself is not the problem. The apparent insistence of wanting to stand out as an individual like that, apart from you team -- that's the problem."
sports,fcgegmz,t1_fcgdzkt,1577639162.0,"He was clearly more demonstrative than every other player in the league. That was obvious if you watched and listened to him. The kneel down after touchdowns was the biggest example, but seemingly every conversation he had on TV started and ended with religion.

I remember even Kurt Warner, who was very religious, told Tebow he needed to tone it down. And Tebow was like ""no, that's just who I am."" Well, OK, but you prayed yourself out of the league. Lol."
sports,fcgc91c,t1_fcgc1gi,1577638535.0,I don't think it was a secret that he only wanted to play quarterback and didn't want to play another position.
sports,fcg8mml,t1_fcg0ma9,1577637643.0,"My impression of him as a player is this: *maybe* he could have been a backup based on his talent. The problem is that he did not have the skills necessary to run a standard NFL offense. He didn't have a strong enough arm, mostly. So as a backup, he would have basically needed his own special offense. If he's backing up Aaron Rodgers or Matt Ryan or whoever, he comes in and he can't run the team's offense because he can't make the throws. They'd have to completely change the offense and tailor it to Tim Tebow's strengths (running, mostly). And that would be at a time where the NFL is all about passing.

The bottom line is that for the NFL game, there are too many guys with strong arms. You don't know who they are because they aren't excessively demonstrative with religion like Tebow is. He was a good college player because he was a good runner and he had a good team around him and because defenses aren't as good in college and so on.... It's just a fantasy that he ever should have been an NFL quarterback. Maybe he could have been a fullback or something but his ego didn't allow that.

Even if he could be the backup, his insistence on being the center of attention with his religious displays created a problem for coaches. You generally don't want to have a backup who draws so much attention to himself that he's drawing attention away from your team. And this is why he had the reputation that he doesn't want to be a guy on a team -- because his demonstrative religious displays showed that he wanted to get a lot of attention. And that goes against team first mentality.

As for the rest, I have no idea about the ""dumb, uncoachable, and just doesn't want to be a guy on a team"" things. But it's pretty funny that you only think it's possible that someone ""leaked"" that he's ""dumb, uncoachable, and just doesn't want to be a guy on a team.""

I mean, why would it need to be ""leaked?"" Coaches and executives in the league know each other. If there was chatter that he was ""dumb, uncoachable, and just doesn't want to be a guy on a team,"" it wasn't ""leaking."" It was actual coaches and executives who made that assessment firsthand.

Again, I don't even know if this is true. But it makes zero sense that there would be some conspiracy to get this guy out of the league. The guy is a boy scout. If anything, there would be the opposite -- a conspiracy to figure out how to keep him in the league if he was good enough. Because he could have been great for the league's image. But he wasn't a good enough quarterback in the NFL in 2019 -- he does not have a good arm, basically. And a good arm is almost everything in the NFL for a quarterback.

I mean, everybody understands that MLB pitchers have a special, innate skill with their arm in that they can throw faster than most people. You can't just put your first baseman at pitcher and say ""maybe it will work out."" And that's what Tim Tebow was like -- he was like a first baseman trying to play pitcher. And he refused to play first base."

Documentaries,fc7n5bf,t1_fc7jx56,1577512995.0,"Not fascism, but the structure of the US economy already means that the US qualifies as an oligarchy.

Who needs fascism when you have a political and media system that can deceive people into embracing the conditions that lead to oligarchy?

The fact of the matter is that modern capitalism in the US is broken, with an economic structure that resembled what it was like to live in a monarchy (which the US was created to escape). And the solution to fixing it in large part lies in informing people through information about the nature of the problems with our economic system. And yet the influences on the flow of information are completely opposed to properly informing people.

>Conservatism is the source of this control, but it is not reliant on the people supporting it. The people could be far to the Left of right now and it wouldn't matter to the Corporations running the media.

You should consider the fact that you are wrong -- that this structure is favored by Republicans much more than even the most moderate Democrat -- and that corporations absolutely do not want anyone on the left to get power. They merely tolerate moderate Democrats because they know they can't have absolute control in our system."
