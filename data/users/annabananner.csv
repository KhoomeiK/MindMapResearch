TwoXChromosomes,feypf6d,t1_feyoi4t,1579448680.0,"You seem to be rebutting a different argument than the one in the analogy. I’ve posted the original in a different comment in this thread. 

It’s not the blood and organs that are compared to a fetus - the fetus is compared to the person that desperately needs your kidney to live. You still cannot be forced to undergo surgery on your body to give your kidney to a dying patient, even thought by making this choice you’re letting the other person die. Even though giving up one kidney doesn’t kill you. 

And a pregnant woman can’t (shouldn’t) be forced to use her body to keep a fetus alive."
TwoXChromosomes,feylnoz,t1_feykyce,1579447258.0,"I actually found the original post I’d read this from (posted it in a reply on this thread) and it clarifies that it’s purely a body autonomy argument to stop people from taking their philosophical argument to the next level and trying to claim a logical legal footing. 
It’s not going to be for every occasion, sure, but it made a lot of sense to me when I read it so I thought I’d share in case it had the same effect on anyone else."
TwoXChromosomes,fey9xdj,t1_fey5u0k,1579442739.0,"Found it: 


‘Reasonable people can disagree about when a zygote becomes a ""human life"" - that's a philosophical question. However, regardless of whether or not one believes a fetus is ethically equivalent to an adult, it doesn't obligate a mother to sacrifice her body autonomy for another, innocent or not.

Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy protected by the Constitution, as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973). Consider a scenario where you are a perfect bone marrow match for a child with severe aplastic anemia; no other person on earth is a close enough match to save the child's life, and the child will certainly die without a bone marrow transplant from you. If you decided that you did not want to donate your marrow to save the child, for whatever reason, the state cannot demand the use of any part of your body for something to which you do not consent. It doesn't matter if the procedure required to complete the donation is trivial, or if the rationale for refusing is flimsy and arbitrary, or if the procedure is the only hope the child has to survive, or if the child is a genius or a saint or anything else - the decision to donate must be voluntary to be constitutional. This right is even extended to a person's body after they die; if they did not voluntarily commit to donate their organs while alive, their organs cannot be harvested after death, regardless of how useless those organs are to the deceased or many lives they would save. That's the law.

Use of a woman's uterus to save a life is no different from use of her bone marrow to save a life - it must be offered voluntarily. By all means, profess your belief that providing one's uterus to save the child is morally just, and refusing is morally wrong. That is a defensible philosophical position, regardless of who agrees and who disagrees. But legally, it must be the woman's choice to carry out the pregnancy. She may choose to carry the baby to term. She may choose not to. Either decision could be made for all the right reasons, all the wrong reasons, or anything in between. But it must be her choice, and protecting the right of body autonomy means the law is on her side. Supporting that precedent is what being pro-choice means.""'"

I understand that this probably makes no impact on religious anti-choice zealots, but it does provide an answer if you’re having a reasonable discussion with someone who’s genuinely open to hearing your point of view."
TwoXChromosomes,fey6tbn,t1_fewk3kr,1579441491.0,"Yeees! And even then it only seems to apply in that specific circumstance. Like ok good job now you won’t judge teenage mothers because your teenage daughter had a baby. That’s not empathy. 

Empathy is taking that experience and applying it to EVERY OTHER AREA OF LIFE where you don’t understand the other persons plight but you CARE about them because you see them as fellow humans. Instead of a pregnant teen imagine it’s a trans teen. Understand that THEY are human and need support."

TwoXChromosomes,fexzed5,t1_fexxj2j,1579438739.0,"Totally a reasonable argument to predict, I’ve been rebutting it with something I read recently that blew my mind - 
If you compare it to organ/blood donation, you could be the only person in the world who’s a donor match and can save the recipients life, but they still can’t FORCE you to donate part of your body to save someone else’s life. Even if you don’t have a medical reason not to donate, even if your reason is ‘I just don’t want to.’ 
Because your body autonomy is protected, they can’t make you do anything with your body to keep someone else alive. 
So they can’t force a woman to use her body to keep a fetus alive."
