What's there to do before one of them does something illegal? Besides, not allowing someone from saying something isn't going to make them not think it. I also think the line is impossible to find and it is very much a slippery slope. One person's obvious line isn't going to be the same as everyone else's regardless if we're talking about extreme topics or more mundane ones."

facepalm,fekkwgn,t1_fejx5fq,1579202179.0,I think most Americans don't care either way. We're taught metric in school and I think most understand it's the more intuitive system but we don't use it in everyday life so it's not a good metric for us to visualize things. I've never heard an American complain or argue against using the metric system.
facepalm,fekkhwe,t1_fek4c3v,1579201943.0,It's not though. Kelvin is based only universal constants.
