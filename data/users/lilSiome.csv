corgi,fg0xhuf,t1_ffzgzce,1580416957.0,Haha they did a bunch of dog ones and Corki got a corgi but not Teemo. Missed opportunity lol.
corgi,ffz46lz,t3_evt8bs,1580363385.0,The vet gave us some allergy meds to try and stop the itching. Luckily it's not mites or anything. It started around the beginning of the colder months and he hasn't been outside as often. Not sure if it's situational or food related.
corgi,ffz3yta,t1_ffy0jw6,1580363174.0,Of course :)

Aquascape,ffxvcou,t3_erfn96,1580333150.0,"Got myself a hungry little albino pleco(will be upgrading to a bigger tank soon) he seems to have taken on the job of keeping the grass clean. Been playing the game find the pleco lol I don't win often. 
I saw a video showing how to syphon your plants without getting the soil so I've been doing that at water changes too. Seems to have cleared up nicely."

Aquascape,feg543k,t1_fefspf6,1579077339.0,I have a feeling the water wasn't good. There was plenty of algie in there. I'm kinda leaning as I go. Still got a school of silver tips I'm hoping they survive until I figure out the problem.
Aquascape,fdlcqd3,t1_fdlb1of,1578521228.0,It does look alot like one. Are they bad for the tank? I found 2 so far and they've grown to 3 times the size in like 2 weeks.
