asoiaf,felxeve,t1_feln358,1579233359.0,"Is that specifically in the books somewhere? I never remember anything about souls. I was under the impression it was better forged steel, like Damascus steel, that the Westerosi plebs can’t figure out; or don’t have the minerals available."
asoiaf,felb7hh,t1_fel8cr6,1579218098.0,"I didn't think there was any mention of blending the VS with regular steel when they made them?  Didn't they just use a sword about the size of a Claymore (blade around 120cm) to make a long sword (90cm...ish?) and a slightly smaller sword (60-65cm?).
On those figures it seems that there is not enough VS to go around, but Ice is described as being as wide as a man's hand iirc.  Long swords are not as wide as that.  
 
I would have thought they will still have the same VS properties but just be smaller swords.  
 
However, I'm stupid so I'm prob not remembering some paragraph."

If you mean; ""Will I vote Green?"" I have to say probably not; I am a Labor voter.  However even that doesn't matter becasue I live in a regional area that has been dominated by LNP voters for decades. Basically my vote will not count; even though I will cast it."

asoiaf,fctlqap,t1_fctg0k2,1577948006.0,Same.  I honestly enjoyed Endymion and Rise of Endymion more after the second read.  It all fell into place a bit more for me.  Epic books; so many complex ideas in them.

Yeah if it’s such an easy conversion it seems crazy not to look into that. I still think that we should be putting the money into the existing fire services rather than trying to get the military to do it though."

australia,fclr2x2,t1_fclqkiu,1577754412.0,"Maybe there is an argument there but I think that the airforce assets are there to supply and support the army when needed. If we convert all the supply planes into water bombers what do we use when we need to supply the army?
 
I think we should use the existing planes to evacuate and supply people and get water bombers specific for the task."
australia,fclpi9t,t3_ehv3jv,1577753320.0,"Personally I reckon soldiers should be trained as soldiers. It might be better to expand our already existing firefighting organisations and put more money into the volunteer firefighting services. 
 
Army can still be called in to run logistical support and clean up when they need it but I reckon train people to do the job they are meant for."
