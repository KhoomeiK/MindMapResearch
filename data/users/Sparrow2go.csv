Something you can fix little things on with wiggle room to make it your own.  Save more money.  Lots more. Start out with the nicest example of your chosen model you can find.

HomeImprovement,fdg7i19,t1_fdg5gwy,1578383231.0,"Haha oh man, 120lbs?  I think you are in the clear.  Were you 500lbs I could see some questions being raised here, but even then the pan should be properly supported for the high side of human weight.

Don‚Äôt budge.  Don‚Äôt question yourself or give any hint as to potentially being at fault.  This person sounds either stupid or predatory.

It would be worth contacting someone familiar with renter‚Äôs rights in your area so you know exactly where the legal line is and know what language to use when dealing with your landlord."
HomeImprovement,fdg4hgc,t3_el7ely,1578379678.0,"Hopefully a professional can chime in here, but I can‚Äôt see how you would possibly be responsible for this.  Shower pans are meant to stand on.  They are designed to be installed to avoid exactly these situations.

Either the landlord is just being a dick trying to get you to pay for this, or their contractor who installed it is being a dick saying you caused it because they did a crap install.

Were you pitching bowling balls into the empty shower?  Storing your spare boulders in there?  No?  Probably not your fault."
HomeImprovement,fde25y9,t3_ekvx87,1578329491.0,Ask over on r/flashlight.  Plenty of threads in the search already as well.
Frugal,fdcz0ph,t3_eklofi,1578288569.0,"Pictures would help.

Can you give some detail on what you mean by restore a candle?

Was the candle damaged?

Did it burn down too small for your liking?

Did the wax melt away and there is just a wick?"
BuyItForLife,fdcd0nh,t1_fdbpq1r,1578271925.0,"You got it.  The little pump sprayer I use has a handle that works with my work shorts pockets, so I just keep it hooked on there, but I also understand not all clothing has pockets or are designed to carry that weight.

I always start in one corner and mop my way backwards toward the exit.  I‚Äôll spray an area of floor then quickly mop it so the cleaner isn‚Äôt sitting on the surface too long.  This is especially important for some flooring materials to avoid damage, as is the amount and type of cleaner used.

It doesn‚Äôt seem as convenient as a mop that sprays for you, but with some practice as just as good if not better."
Cooking,fdb77e7,t3_ekhnbc,1578254530.0,"[This](http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/) is a great article on how and why to use flax seed oil to season a cast iron/carbon steel pan using science based evidence.  Not ‚ÄúI heard‚Äù or ‚Äúmy mother always used‚Äù.  Sufficed to say, low smoke point flax seed oil (unrefined) provides the best non stick seasoning surface when used properly.  

You are on the right track.  Read the article and enjoy your new pan once finished."
