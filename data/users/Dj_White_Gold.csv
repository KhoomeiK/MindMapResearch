Of course, I'm just a Gen Z'er talking here (one of the oldest, but still pretty young). I'm not planning to rely on Social Security, and I'm much more concerned with a war starting during my 20's than I am with a relatively small check I may or may not get in my 60's."

MurderedByWords,ffk7uf6,t1_ffjz3x2,1580018393.0,"Social security has never worked as a ""savings"" system. It inherently relies on younger people paying into the system, which can be perfectly sustainable as long as everyone is always having children.

&#x200B;

When Social Security first started, the beneficiaries hadn't payed into the system at all. Yet it's lasted almost 100 years at this point, and still works pretty well. The younger people pay in, that money is paid out to the older people. In 40 years, those younger people become the older people, and there are new younger people paying into the system. It's very much like a Ponzi scheme, but it's set up in a way that it's reasonably sustainable.

&#x200B;

Now, there is an argument that current practices are not sustainable. But here's the deal: practices can change. This raises the legitimate question: ""But how can we change the practices when the Boomers hold all the political power?"" Simple: by the time it becomes an issue, the Boomers will (mostly) be long dead, and the Millennials will be the group with the most political power, which they can use to fix the Social Security system.

&#x200B;

With regards to Social Security money going to other areas of government: while this is immoral, the reason that it is possible is because that money is left over after paying out Social Security checks. The fact that the current beneficiaries are getting their checks right now tells you that we can afford to put the money into other parts of government. Using the money to ensure that we stay the world's most developed economy is significantly more important to future retirees than trying to invest the money and barely beat inflation.

&#x200B;

Besides this, money doesn't work the same way for the federal government as it does for you or I. Look up the ""Trillion dollar coin"" if you don't believe me. It's almost impossible to bankrupt the Federal government. And as far as debt goes? If I don't pay back a loan, law enforcement can become involved to collect. How would another country collect debt on the U.S? By starting a war that'd end up costing them more than the original debt, and that they'd probably lose? Besides that, a good bit of the debt is held by American citizens, who generally have a vested interest in making sure that the Federal government is stable.

&#x200B;

The only way Social Security goes away is if when this becomes an issue, the Millenials decide to do away with the system instead of fixing it. (Assuming it even becomes an issue)

college,fee3r3x,t3_eomjwv,1579025780.0,"One of my main methods for study is simply making sure that I fully understand homework assignments. Instead of working as a group or relying on the internet for homework solutions, I sit down with the textbook and figure out how to do the problems myself. Of course, this is for Engineering classes, so this study style is more focused on solving a certain format of problem vs. studying broader ideas, as you do in humanities courses. 

&#x200B;

I usually review the main topics in the few hours leading up to an exam so that they will be fresh in my mind. For a particularly challenging exam, I read the chapters in the textbook that the exam will cover. This is especially useful for open book tests, as you will remember where to find specific examples and passages.

&#x200B;

I will never study for multiple subjects at the same time. This results in stress and confusion. If I have two exams on the same day, with one in the morning and one in the afternoon, I study for the morning test the night before, then spend the rest of the day studying for the afternoon class.

&#x200B;

I also have a tendency to study for other classes during lecture. The prime example would be studying for my Materials class during my Economics class. This is a matter of priority- I would never consider doing the opposite. The economics class was practically a blow-off for me, while Materials was a very challenging class. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Review notes and chapters before exams, do the homework completely by yourself, don't be afraid to study for one class during lecture for an easy class, and don't try and study for two subjects at once."

We weren't allowed graphing calculators, only scientific. It had nothing to do with the mathematical abilities of the calculator, it was because most graphing calculators have functions where they can store notes. When you have a test where a major component is memorizing poly atomic ions, there'd definitely be people in the class storing notes in their calculator and using it to cheat. Same thing with physics if students are required to memorize certain equations or constants, or a multitude of other classes.

&#x200B;

It's also one of the main reasons why graphing calculators aren't allowed on the FE exam. Graphing wouldn't help you too much on that exam, but having notes stored on the calculator sure would.

There's definitely a certain etiquette that I always follow to prevent that sort of thing:

&#x200B;

1. Don't curb shop while people are in the yard or driveway. I may note the house and come back later, but I won't stop and grab something with the homeowner watching me. This isn't universal, but it's a rule I have for myself.
2. Don't shop out of a dumpster someone's using. I've been on the receiving end of this, and it really slows you down when you can't dump stuff because some asshole decided to start climbing around in your dumpster.
3. Don't shop out of big piles unless they've been there awhile. This applies to your situation- big piles often mean that it isn't free for the taking.
4. Only shop on the curb. Something in the front yard isn't free for the taking, only something right against (or in) the street.

There are other things too, but I'm always careful so that I don't take something that wasn't meant to be taken."
starterpacks,fe5v9yf,t1_fe0nnmc,1578875734.0,"The number one thing I'll see on the side of the road is cracked screens. These generally aren't worth fixing- the panel is by far the most valuable part of the device. Sometimes they can be good for parts, but I usually just leave them.

&#x200B;

Besides that, you mainly see issues with the logic boards and power supplies. These are the ones I pick up. I never bother to diagnose the exact component that failed, because for most TV's, you can get replacement logic boards or power supplies for about $20 on eBay. At those prices, it's not worth the trouble to replace individual components.

&#x200B;

Then, every once in awhile, you find one that still works perfectly. It'll probably be missing the remote and the cables, but those are trivial. A lot of people would rather throw them on the curb than go through the hassle of selling them on Craigslist or Facebook, and I understand why.

&#x200B;

Also, this only applies to LCD TV's. Most CRT's you see on the side of the road are in perfect working order, but they're generally not worth anything, and Goodwill won't take them anymore. If you just want a TV to stick in a garage, extra bedroom, or shop, my suggestion would be to grab a CRT instead of trying to fix an LCD."

 Without experience, you're much less likely to find an internship through online applications, because your resume is all they can see. Most freshmen resumes  are quite frankly not impressive. 

To be successful, in-person methods work much better. The key with these is to be memorable- use your appearance, conversational skills, and ability to elaborate on individual projects to your advantage. 

Not that I would suggest this if you aren't otherwise interested, but I actually became an RA largely for this purpose: I got experience in real interviews, and my interpersonal skills have greatly improved. It also gives me more stuff to talk about. This idea can be applied to other positions as well- club leadership, Greek life, other campus jobs, etc...

As far as how to initiate these in-person situations: the big one is definitely career fairs. Most engineering schools have them, and they can't be beat with regards to getting you face-to-face with potential employers. This is how I got my summer internship- I talked to dozens of employers at the career fair. Most weren't interested in anyone below a junior, but a few were looking younger. I ended up talking to a paper company that I really liked, and was offered an interview the next day. I came prepared, and was offered an internship that week. 

The other, admittedly less common method, is personal connections. It's a matter of talking to people you know, and talking to people that friends and parents know. This is likely what I'll try next year: I'd like to try an internship with an oil driller. Talking to a company at the career fair may work, but luckily, my mother works in the industry, and knows people who may be interested in hiring. Obviously this isn't universal, but it's more common than most people think. 

Finally, realize that you're much more likely to find an internship if you're willing to work far from home. My internship this summer is about 300 miles away- in the same state as my school, but on the other side of it. Everyone else I know who already has their internship will be doing it in another state. Employers realize this, and most internships will include housing as part of the compensation. Mine pays for an apartment in a nearby town, most will pay for an apartment in the same town. 

Tldr: it's all about confidence, interpersonal skills, and talking face-to-face. Internships are competitive, yes, but they aren't really *that* hard to get if you're serious about it."
