Life,fd8xske,t1_fd718po,1578225066.0,"Yes, more or less. In short, try to someone, who does all the things he know he should do and doesn't do the things that he knows he shouldn't do. Imagine someone that is teleported to a random location and he just looks around, smiles and tell to himself ""Well, what do we have here?"", the one confident to thrive and make the most of any situation. Helping without expecting reward, not judging. Not only pretending and losing myself in that lie, but trully becoming that person.

If you were to put it into todays context, try imagining some ancient sage or someone who has grasped the understanding of life, that is about to open an ice-cream bussiness with fierce competition in the period of crisis. Oh, how much fun would he have and tranquility would he feel, even though others would become depressed and anxious in that situation. 

I want to become that, the one who has has mastered the art of life and became trully virtuous, free of everything - yet chose to remain behind to be amused and amuse others.

&#x200B;

For longer explanation:

I want to become person that is calm and composed when the things go his way and slightly amused and free of worry when things don't, aware of problems that can arise, but not worrying about them. 

Decisive and confident in my decisions and choices. Saying the things that need to be said, but letting the actions talk mainly.

Being quiet when there is nothing I could do by talking. Skilled in the art of life, virtuous, not stuck in the past. Without regrets, the one that is able to discard hurtful memories after he extracted the lesson from them. 

Despite all of that, not be alienated from people and society. Having the ability to be empatetic in some situations and call bull\*hit and smack someone when I know it's the best for him, but not being rash in those decisions.

Able to admit honest mistake and not being apologetic about it, knowing I don't have to explain myself.

It's a bit longer, but hope it helps. Something like this. :)"
Life,fd5z1yp,t1_fd5hgjt,1578183306.0,"Thanks for the question. It has to be said, that once I realized that I was lacking determination precisely because I had no direction, I researched it a lot. I thought about it and talked to other people.

&#x200B;

What I found out was that about 80% had no idea why their life was worth living and basically aligned with the ideas others told them they should go for, they didn't even pick it actively, they just went with it, not putting their heart to it.

About 15% was also lost, searching for meaning and lacking motivation to do anything.

The last 5% was the most ""ambicious"" group of people. They picked something in the future (usually something they couldn't influence directly) and pursued it (wealth, achievents, ..)

After that, I was feeling down and decided to distract myself for quite some time by playing games and reading.

But the realisation itself was really just sudden AHA moment. It might sound strange, but I got this feeling that I shouldn't play the videogame for once, but think about it just one last time.

I got this feeling that I am getting close to someting, so I kept at it, I took all the fantasies and dreams I had about other worlds and dimensions, it just didnt sit well with me that I had so many different fantasies, mostly with otherworldly circumstances - monster and magic, zombies, ... What started to bother me were the fantasies where I didn't have any particular abilities or skills, that just didnt fit somehow - resolving a bank robery, getting kidnapped by pirates and becoming their leader, imagining living in a fastasy world even as a normal person, ... (yes, I spend most of my waking and sleeping life living in imainary situations)

&#x200B;

And sudenly, a tought came to me. There were two elements they shared - me being the same personality in every single of them and the situations being unusual. But It was always about me managing to deal with the situation, so there was only 1 element - me, being the same personality, appearing in different extreme situations where the personality could shine in its fullest.

&#x200B;

Afterwards, it took some time to process logically, but some part of me knew that was it. At last, I had two questions I wanted to ask myself - 

1) ""If I were to follow the goal of becoming who I am in the fantasies, Is there any situation when I would abandon it for any kind of reason?"" The answer was No, I can't think of any situation in which I wouldnt wanna be the one I was in those fantasies or aspire to be him.)

2) Is that something I can actually influence? The answer was yes, absolutelly.  On contrary to being 1st in sport or having a family that loves you, this is something that I can achieve no matter the circumstances.

Every time I think about it, it fills me with the feeling that It's just inevitable, there is no future where I would rather be the personality I am now, as opposed to be close to the personality of the one I wanted to be in tose fantasies.

&#x200B;

TL;DR:  A lot of research and talking with others, a lot of thinking, but lead to nothing, only became more depressed. Had feeling I should try to think about it once more after some time, that it was the last chance, sudden realisation came.

Had to process it a bit and came to a conclusion that (a) It is something that I can directly influence no matter what and (b) There was no scenario that I wouldn't wanna be the person I fantasised myself as. It's not a meaning of my life, but it's a goal that fills me with joy and energy to continue."
