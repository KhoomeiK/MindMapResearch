I don’t always get to work at his station, but I’d rather be with the puffins than the penguins. And this little guy is why!"

The best and the brightest from all over the world come here to join the university systems. They stay, become professors, and the cycle continues. We owe a LOT to our immigrant educators."

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the rain!"

It won’t be until she saves her entire village from invading fur trappers that she will be accepted again by her true family."

He said he hated it and never wanted to play it again. The music he did play was awesome, though. He’s no sell out, that’s for sure."

Here’s a word of advice from a learn-by-doing DIY’er: try not to focus on the tiny imperfections, or the small mistakes and compromises. Remember the big picture: you just added about $20K in sweat equity to your home’s now-increased value...and you get to enjoy the new kitchen!"

gaystoriesgonewild,fcm2dxk,t1_fci7swb,1577762440.0,"There’s no real need to put a label on your sexuality. It’s unique, like you are! That said, labels can help us form community and build useful social constructions. But labels never really capture the diversity of human sexuality. It’s why we have the jumble of “LGBTQ+” these days. It’s messy. It’s sometimes complicated. And it can be confusing. But it’s also wonderful.

Some guys just like sex with guys, but don’t necessarily get emotionally attached. The good news is that men who have sex with other men is very common. You should have no trouble finding someone willing to let you explore that side of yourself. 

Good luck and play safe!"
gaystoriesgonewild,fcbqedv,t3_egylft,1577589818.0,"Ask yourself the same question but substitute your same sex (I presume male) for “girl”. Do you look at an attractive guy and feel sexual? Do you “prefer” the female body for sex? Ask yourself about same-sex attractions. Be honest.

That’s as good of an answer as you’ll likely ever get. 

My suspicion is that very, very few of us are truly, 100% heterosexual all the time for our entire lives."
