gerbil,fdk9npg,t1_fdjxtb4,1578499214.0,"Yes there are cases where gerbils are hard to introduce to other gerbils because they are so focused on their territory and their smell. But it is far more stress for a gerbil to live a lonely live than to undergo a several day introduction. If the introduction is handled correctly (future partner chosen wisely and in hindsight of your gerbils personality; duration of introduction; size of introduction space; right introduction method according to gerbils age etc) there is a good chance for it to work. Gerbils are social animals and need to have a companion to feel well and safe. I have introduced several gerbils because I work part time at an SOS-facility for rodents since 2016 in Germany. And I have experienced several gerbils that had to live alone for a long period of time - they get depressed, unsociable, nervous or just lose their drive to run around or play. The animal’s well-being is my biggest interest and keeping them alone severely damages their well-being. As bad as it is for humans to isolate, it also is for rodents such as rats, mice or gerbils. You can keep a hamster alone for all of his life. You shouldn’t keep a gerbil alone though if you want it to be happy. And if you don’t have the time to care for your animals, you shouldn’t keep them anyway. It is part of the ownership. You get gerbils with the fact in mind that they cannot live alone. That you need to pay the bills when they get sick, etc. It’s like saying well, if I don’t have the money I can’t pay the vet. True, but you know that before you get yourself animals. If you don’t have time to take care of them and give them a companion, that’s not the animals fault but yours. But if a gerbil is kept alone for too long, it can’t be reintroduced to another gerbil anymore anyway because it is already unsocial."
