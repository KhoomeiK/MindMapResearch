She buys this niece dozens of toys, most of which the niece barely likes, has a room dedicated to her toys that is so full my niece can't even play in it, etc. It's insane."
90daysgoal,ffwo9hv,t3_evmtuk,1580306901.0,"Hey, y'all! I slept great last night, but that kind of sleep where it was good so I desperately want more haha. Finally it seems my sleep is getting back on track. Today is work (busy day planned), a run and dinner. I'd like to read some before bed, as I'm still not in that habit, but I'm making okay progress on my book regardless.

As for next sprint, most of my goals are just continued: Duolingo, Noom articles, weight loss at 5 lbs/month, eating in my calorie goal, Apple Health every day, and running 60 miles minimum (I beat that goal by a lot this month). Continuing on my 10K plan, and should be all finished up next month, though I have noticed my knee is protesting slightly. Biggest change for next month is new money goals (Pay off one credit card, extra spending <$100 if possible), starting Strong Lifts (started last night technically, but mostly to attempt form -- barbell squats are HARD), and picking up a yoga habit on Saturdays for mental health and socialization. Overall, I'm feeling positive about January, but I always go strong through January on NY goals. February and March are when I always fall off the wagon, so I'm hoping this time it's different."

loseit,ffu2z1c,t1_ffu2qe1,1580233374.0,"Yeah, I was technically obese but only for a few months (I also have a lot of muscle admittedly). I’ve been consistently 150 for several years (middle range of overweight BMI) and only went up past it to 165 for about 6 months. Possibly just taking a while to catch up brain-wise, it’s just frustrating that I can see someone 5’1 and 220 lbs and little muscle, and think “Yup, that’s my body.”"
