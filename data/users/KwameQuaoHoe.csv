nba,fffks0s,t1_fffde0t,1579886099.0,Even sans the study the other two things I said are indelibly true. Plus even if you’re study is proven to be 100% true(it is just one study after all) it still points out that weight is an indirect factor which means it’s nonetheless a factor.
nba,fffkqhp,t1_fffjgmc,1579886074.0,"Ok tell me this, harder and more impact to jump with or without a 20lb jacket on you? In my experience, not opinion, yes very much so harder and over time my mechanics falter and it’s a much bigger toll on my body."
nba,fffacuk,t1_fff9p4q,1579879576.0,Weight definitely affects your mechanics so yes weight is an issue. It also affects your conditioning(his conditioning obviously isn’t great either) which weakens your mechanics over time so still yes weight is an issue. And I don’t care what study I’m shown you’ll never convince me that having more weight when you land doesn’t affect pressure on the joints over time. that’s like saying getting hit is getting hit no matter how forceful the hit itself is.
AskReddit,fff9tyl,t3_et9u72,1579879236.0,The Little Engine That Could
nba,fff9hdx,t1_ffeyus8,1579879008.0,Do you remember when mark said he didn’t remember his first game and van gundy said “I wouldn’t remember going 1 for 4 in 19 minutes either.” And Jackson quickly started saying “ don’t do that! no really don’t do that”...why was a game from over 30 years ago triggering him so badly lol?
nba,fff98sg,t1_ffevsqz,1579878852.0,"His weight is definitely an issue. Anyone who has a history of knee problems as an athlete should be looking to lose weight, not add it likely he obviously has."
nba,fff956p,t1_ffevck4,1579878785.0,It’s obvious from looking at him on the screen that he’s gotten heavier then he was previously and he was already too heavy. If you watched him in summer league it was pretty obvious he was out of shape and he’s only gotten bigger since then.
nba,fff5xm1,t1_fff30wr,1579876539.0,"It’s not normalizing, Kidd was THE triple double guy during his time and in his time like 7-10 triple doubles in a season was extremely impressive."
funny,fff3xj0,t1_ffcqw09,1579875048.0,"Na that first step was a pivot before the dribble, perfectly legal. It was an all in all good and legal move."
hiphopheads,ffdr4w3,t3_esyctd,1579826906.0,So basically I’m going to continue to think what I already thought: “Fuck the Grammy’s”.
NBA2k,ffcgwo4,t1_ffcc3qr,1579799207.0,Yea definitely. The fact that you can’t just completely sag off on him opens things up for him.
NBA2k,ffcbass,t1_ffca5l2,1579795735.0,It’s a over exaggeration but left open as wide as he was it’s not surprising he went 4/4. Now that teams know they can’t do that I doubt he becomes known as a deadly shooter.
UpliftingNews,ff8pdtm,t3_es4j0x,1579690265.0,This is downlifting news.
nba,ff6whaj,t1_ff6ikcb,1579636313.0,"Well I mean I remember when he was in high school and it definitely had over a million by the time he reached Kentucky. It wasn’t the 9.5M but it was definitely over an M I remember that much. A player named Seventh Woods, who is mostly forgotten, isn’t going to the NBA and isn’t even gunna start on his college team has a video from high school that has 15M and he’s only decreased in popularity since high school."
nba,ff6fwjo,t1_ff61rlf,1579626322.0,"They shouldn’t get paid because it’s still amateur sports. It’s not labor in the sense of employment because like I just said, college athletes aren’t employees of the school. If you’re using the word labor just to mean working on something then sure it’s labor but then so is studying a book."
nba,ff6fgs4,t1_ff64ejl,1579626047.0,Yea if you go type in his high school highlights one has 9.5 million
nba,ff5yzgn,t1_ff5xx0g,1579614748.0,"Yea for those type of games those are actually totally are on YouTube. But the really elite basketball teams, the ones that have no problems filling a college arena, yea they definitely make money and are on tv a few times a year every year."
nba,ff5y400,t1_ff5tn53,1579614020.0,Labor is employment in this sense. Playing basketball at a university is recreational/extracurricular. I guess if you start paying them then yes you could stop saying they were students at the university playing basketball and more so just employees of the universities semi pro team.
nba,ff5xpmk,t1_ff5xi4p,1579613679.0,You can monetize live streaming that’s 100% a thing and that’s exactly what anyone who was looking to broadcast large sporting events would do.
nba,ff5xctj,t1_ff5v3ls,1579613372.0,Like I’ve said countless times on this thread the NCAA is a pretty huge entity and the people you’re establishing you’re whole argument on represent less than a percent of their participants. The solution isn’t to turn colleges into semi pro leagues to make it work for that small percentage and no of the other percentage. There are people are in college sports that are essentially semi pros masquerading as students but the availability of more robust semi pros options rather than dissolving amateur athletics and making schools development leagues.
nba,ff5x1i2,t1_ff5vazl,1579613091.0,Never said it was worth that you did.
nba,ff5ry5l,t1_ff5rnuj,1579607935.0,Whatever I’m not even reading that it’s clear you’re out of element here I’m done talking.
nba,ff5rfbg,t1_ff5r61c,1579607312.0,You don’t know what you’re talking about bro. You’re sitting here acting like you know who watches what and obviously you’re wrong. If people weren’t tuning into watch it ESPN would not expand resources to have it on TV like they do but they’ve been doing it for years. There’s no part of your argument that explains why they would keep it on for this long if they didn’t find it in anyway profitable. IG followers say a lot. Soccer is the most watched sport in the world and guess which people have the most followers on IG in the world? Soccer players.
nba,ff5qix1,t1_ff5le39,1579606165.0,"Except people are totally doing that and that’s why ESPN has been hosting high school games for years now. Some of the players have half a million to a million followers on IG sometimes. ESPN hosts bowling, and I legit was watching monster trucks like two hours ago—no bowler or monster trucker in the world has that sort of following— so of course they can fit high school basketball in."
nba,ff5qczy,t1_ff5pgd0,1579605943.0,Never said it was good bro I’m saying that turning universities into what would essentially be semi-pro leagues isn’t the answer.
nba,ff5q31s,t1_ff5ptij,1579605571.0,It’s definitely a broken system but paying them in the same manor as professionals is not the answer.
nba,ff5pnyu,t1_ff5l392,1579605002.0,"I didn’t say they could, I said or at least meant they should. As in that’s something they should change looking forward. I don’t think it’s a perfect system things could change but having contracts likes professionals is just a no. The 100,000 person crowd you’re talking of again accounts for hardly any of the NCAA in its entirety. Trying to pay the athletes in the same manor you pay professionals is not only bad for the athletes but the universities themselves. Athletes are already seen as somewhat above or separate from the student body to begin having them as employees of the university that possibly make more than the teachers would further alienate them to a gross degree."
nba,ff5pkfa,t1_ff5l25s,1579604864.0,"You don’t need to be in it to get it but you definitely understand why it’s like that if you participate and participating in something always gives it greater meaning. For example, I would say the majority of athletes I knew would honestly be on my side of the fence in this argument. I remember all of us being pretty understanding of why us getting paid wasn’t a great idea. There’s quite a few protections that are actually beneficial to us that we would forgo just to be paid a baristas wage(should it be equalized pay) or just pittance because the great majority could no way command the amount of money that someone at Kentucky playing basketball could."
nba,ff5p9kk,t1_ff5ks2p,1579604427.0,"Because the NCAA is massive, there’s such disparities between the smallest and biggest schools it’s entirely impossible to reconcile on what you would give to either and then you factor in the hundreds of sports and different players and it’s altogether much more difficult than you are making it seem. Your solution is “just pay them” with no idea of how you’re going to do that fairly in place. It would be a cluster fuck and just create new but different problem. The players that really do command money that your standing up for account for less than 1% of participating athletes. For most NCAA players yes, they are truly amateurs you’re only thinking of the infinitesimal amount of players who really should just be professionals. It’s more so an issue between the colleges and the professional leagues to create a robust semi professional option so the option of amateurism and professional play is there but just turning colleges into semi pro leagues isn’t healthy for universities."
nba,ff5kfos,t1_ff5jrbv,1579597142.0,"I was more than a person in a meeting, I was a person who the meeting was all about. And from that meeting I had to go live it as well. Much different than popping your head in on the subject every now and then when you hear it come up. But basically, from all that, we’re in a agreeance. I agree that the NCAA is ludicrous and allows the athlete almost no means of making extra money but takes from them much of their time. They make enough that no participating member should struggle. They should take care of them and allow them to do what they can to take care of themselves, but not pay them like pro athletes that really would change the game forever."
nba,ff5jizs,t1_ff5j15h,1579595839.0,"I’ve already said it like umpteen times that profiting off your own likeness is not only cool but preferred. That, stipends(which are already a thing), and better conferring with professional leagues that allow more options for players who want to and are capable of forgoing their amateur status and that’s for the most part problem solved. Trying to pay everyone would just create a new, different problem."
nba,ff5j9tg,t1_ff5iyd7,1579595478.0,"Yeaaa, you practice because you want to get better and win not because you are trying to get paid and you totally understand that going in no ones pulling any tricks. A scholarship is competitive and a lot of work and you have to be different to begin with to get one, go figures. I agree with profiting off likeness and also giving players stipends since they can’t work(this is actually already a thing) but contracting them and getting them agents just really isn’t in the question."
nba,ff5izfv,t1_ff5igns,1579595077.0,"Actually “athlete” isn’t where the equation difficult. As an athlete you aren’t forced to play in the NCAA. It’s being an “amateur” that makes things difficult. Look, I’m guessing you never even played in the NCAA to understand(I did) and never had to sit through the(boring,mandatory) hours of classes on amateurism to even begin to understand so I’ll just leave it there."
nba,ff5isnx,t1_ff5igns,1579594817.0,"Noooo, you just don’t understand what you’re talking about. The players you’re standing up for that have a likeness that’s worth anything account for like less than 1% of those participating in college athletics, if you try to start paying them then you have to start paying every single player even the ones that would never be on TV, or who don’t play much, the ones absolutely no is paying to see, etc. and that’s where it becomes too difficult to manage. Too many teams, too many players, and too big a disparity of what they bring in. If you thought WNBA players get mad about their pay you could only imagine the clusterfuck that would ensue trying to pay all collegiate athletes."
nba,ff5i9ku,t1_ff5i3js,1579594109.0,"Well if you go type in John walls high school highlights you’ll see he generated millions of views even in high school and he’s hardly alone in that regard. So basically the answer is obvious and you probably already knew it, there’s enough interest for them to be on TV so they are if there wasn’t they wouldn’t be."
nba,ff5i2hq,t1_ff5hle3,1579593846.0,There’s no comparison between a bagger and a sports player. Basketball is recreation not labor I think you’ve got those two things complete confused. You keep saying “labor” as if these guys are playing basketball against their will or out of need.
nba,ff5hwxl,t1_ff5hle3,1579593645.0,"You obviously got to a point in my post a decided to stop reading. I said they can profit off their own likeness. But paying them to play on a college team, no. It’s called amateurism. If a player would like to forgo his amateur status no one’s stopping them or duping them into remaining in amateur sports."
nba,ff5hk4m,t1_ff5f50q,1579593183.0,"All in all, it’s a a complex solution that you, because you’re so unfamiliar with it, are trying to make sound simple. It really isn’t that simple."
nba,ff5h79h,t1_ff5h0q4,1579592719.0,"Well idk Ja Morant and Luka Doncic are under 22 and make quite a bit of money playing basketball. I don’t see where I mentioned being 22. And yea definitely playing basketball is a world different from child actors. A child actor has an agent that negotiated a contract for them and they forgo school basically to just work a high school basketball player does um, absolutely none of that??? Don’t ever remember getting a W2 when I signed up for a team."
nba,ff5gzv4,t1_ff5gn3o,1579592455.0,"Then stay outta this convo cause you clearly aren’t up to date. They’re on all the time. You can actually watch a very popular classic (Hoophall,the one bronny’s team is in) playing on ESPN now. If they only played the all American game then this thread wouldn’t even be a topic??? That’s one game a year. Just because u personally haven’t been paying attention doesn’t mean they aren’t happening."
nba,ff5fgth,t1_ff5f50q,1579590569.0,"As a guy who has been on one of those nationally televised ESPN games I can tell you no one feels exploited. It’s not like you’re ordered too or it’s something you deal with all season long so it gets in the way of stuff or it’s stressful. It’s like a treat, for a game or so you get to fly(for some dudes it was their first time on a plane) across the country and get awesome lodging and treatment like you were a professional player and afterwards everyone at home treats you like you’re so cool. Not a single player walks alway feeling used and you aren’t it was honestly more exciting than going to the state championship."
nba,ff5esgv,t1_ff5c7er,1579589777.0,"Exploiting them to play and get exposure all across the country, in the finest arenas, against the best competition and play their favorite sport in front of thousands instead of just in their hometown, on a slip n slide court, against kids who dribble off their foot, and in front of 30 ppl...the fucking bastards."
nba,ff5ejjd,t1_ff5aefb,1579589496.0,Absolutely not lol. It’s high school so there are still kids on the bench who are barely competent ball players. You either completely unjustly pays those kids or completely alienate them and only pay certain ones.
nba,ff5egmd,t1_ff56kz5,1579589403.0,What’s with the splitting hairs? Whether they got a contract with YouTube or ESPN they’re gunna get money to broadcast what’s your big deal with who does it?
nba,ff5eecj,t1_ff547b3,1579589331.0,Why not? It’s on TV so obviously it’s generating demand. Top recruits highlight videos generate millions of views sometimes people want a chance to conveniently watch them why not deliver that?
nba,ff5ebzf,t1_ff56a69,1579589256.0,Well he’s on a team that has two of some of the top seniors in America and a few other nationally ranked players so they would be on TV regardless.
nba,ff5e94d,t1_ff540rf,1579589167.0,"There’s no fucking way high schoolers should be getting paid lol. Even college is iffy, so high school is an even bigger no. It’s still a high school, so there’s still a handful kids on the end of the bench who are barely competent basketball players that you either have to unjustly pay or alienate them and not pay. The only thing you can do with amateur sports is allow players to use their likeness to make some money but contractual paying them is a slippery slope cause it’s impossible to do it evenly. There’s a couple guys and a couple teams really raking in the money but for the majority of other teams/players they definitely aren’t.

Edit: it’s okay, none of you know a thing about amateur athletics and of course you don’t—it’s reddit."

nba,ff0lwaz,t1_fezm3i4,1579470127.0,He said 60 wins. That warriors team had like 45ish. Sure steph was the leader of that team but he was hardly overwhelming like KG was.
nba,ff0l7nv,t1_fezycfj,1579469886.0,"Well that bigger market means a lot actually. And you guys have been in existence a lot longer, have had great players play for you, and have a championship before Curry. Curry definitely has been transformative to the franchise but that doesn’t lessen my point that on the court he’s not anymore impactful than a prime KG just in a different way."
nba,feztkjr,t1_fezg05g,1579461483.0,Definitely KG. Curry has just had the fortune of a bigger market and better franchise he’s not single handedly more impactful. I don’t think he could have done some of the things KG did had been stuck on a team like the Wolves who perennially can’t get it together.

nba,ff5jizs,t1_ff5j15h,1579595839.0,"Iâ€™ve already said it like umpteen times that profiting off your own likeness is not only cool but preferred. That, stipends(which are already a thing), and better conferring with professional leagues that allow more options for players who want to and are capable of forgoing their amateur status and thatâ€™s for the most part problem solved. Trying to pay everyone would just create a new, different problem."
nba,ff5j9tg,t1_ff5iyd7,1579595478.0,"Yeaaa, you practice because you want to get better and win not because you are trying to get paid and you totally understand that going in no ones pulling any tricks. A scholarship is competitive and a lot of work and you have to be different to begin with to get one, go figures. I agree with profiting off likeness and also giving players stipends since they canâ€™t work(this is actually already a thing) but contracting them and getting them agents just really isnâ€™t in the question."
nba,ff5izfv,t1_ff5igns,1579595077.0,"Actually â€œathleteâ€ isnâ€™t where the equation difficult. As an athlete you arenâ€™t forced to play in the NCAA. Itâ€™s being an â€œamateurâ€ that makes things difficult. Look, Iâ€™m guessing you never even played in the NCAA to understand(I did) and never had to sit through the(boring,mandatory) hours of classes on amateurism to even begin to understand so Iâ€™ll just leave it there."
nba,ff5isnx,t1_ff5igns,1579594817.0,"Noooo, you just donâ€™t understand what youâ€™re talking about. The players youâ€™re standing up for that have a likeness thatâ€™s worth anything account for like less than 1% of those participating in college athletics, if you try to start paying them then you have to start paying every single player even the ones that would never be on TV, or who donâ€™t play much, the ones absolutely no is paying to see, etc. and thatâ€™s where it becomes too difficult to manage. Too many teams, too many players, and too big a disparity of what they bring in. If you thought WNBA players get mad about their pay you could only imagine the clusterfuck that would ensue trying to pay all collegiate athletes."
nba,ff5i9ku,t1_ff5i3js,1579594109.0,"Well if you go type in John walls high school highlights youâ€™ll see he generated millions of views even in high school and heâ€™s hardly alone in that regard. So basically the answer is obvious and you probably already knew it, thereâ€™s enough interest for them to be on TV so they are if there wasnâ€™t they wouldnâ€™t be."
nba,ff5i2hq,t1_ff5hle3,1579593846.0,Thereâ€™s no comparison between a bagger and a sports player. Basketball is recreation not labor I think youâ€™ve got those two things complete confused. You keep saying â€œlaborâ€ as if these guys are playing basketball against their will or out of need.
nba,ff5hwxl,t1_ff5hle3,1579593645.0,"You obviously got to a point in my post a decided to stop reading. I said they can profit off their own likeness. But paying them to play on a college team, no. Itâ€™s called amateurism. If a player would like to forgo his amateur status no oneâ€™s stopping them or duping them into remaining in amateur sports."
nba,ff5hk4m,t1_ff5f50q,1579593183.0,"All in all, itâ€™s a a complex solution that you, because youâ€™re so unfamiliar with it, are trying to make sound simple. It really isnâ€™t that simple."
nba,ff5h79h,t1_ff5h0q4,1579592719.0,"Well idk Ja Morant and Luka Doncic are under 22 and make quite a bit of money playing basketball. I donâ€™t see where I mentioned being 22. And yea definitely playing basketball is a world different from child actors. A child actor has an agent that negotiated a contract for them and they forgo school basically to just work a high school basketball player does um, absolutely none of that??? Donâ€™t ever remember getting a W2 when I signed up for a team."
nba,ff5gzv4,t1_ff5gn3o,1579592455.0,"Then stay outta this convo cause you clearly arenâ€™t up to date. Theyâ€™re on all the time. You can actually watch a very popular classic (Hoophall,the one bronnyâ€™s team is in) playing on ESPN now. If they only played the all American game then this thread wouldnâ€™t even be a topic??? Thatâ€™s one game a year. Just because u personally havenâ€™t been paying attention doesnâ€™t mean they arenâ€™t happening."
nba,ff5fgth,t1_ff5f50q,1579590569.0,"As a guy who has been on one of those nationally televised ESPN games I can tell you no one feels exploited. Itâ€™s not like youâ€™re ordered too or itâ€™s something you deal with all season long so it gets in the way of stuff or itâ€™s stressful. Itâ€™s like a treat, for a game or so you get to fly(for some dudes it was their first time on a plane) across the country and get awesome lodging and treatment like you were a professional player and afterwards everyone at home treats you like youâ€™re so cool. Not a single player walks alway feeling used and you arenâ€™t it was honestly more exciting than going to the state championship."
nba,ff5esgv,t1_ff5c7er,1579589777.0,"Exploiting them to play and get exposure all across the country, in the finest arenas, against the best competition and play their favorite sport in front of thousands instead of just in their hometown, on a slip n slide court, against kids who dribble off their foot, and in front of 30 ppl...the fucking bastards."
nba,ff5ejjd,t1_ff5aefb,1579589496.0,Absolutely not lol. Itâ€™s high school so there are still kids on the bench who are barely competent ball players. You either completely unjustly pays those kids or completely alienate them and only pay certain ones.
nba,ff5egmd,t1_ff56kz5,1579589403.0,Whatâ€™s with the splitting hairs? Whether they got a contract with YouTube or ESPN theyâ€™re gunna get money to broadcast whatâ€™s your big deal with who does it?
nba,ff5eecj,t1_ff547b3,1579589331.0,Why not? Itâ€™s on TV so obviously itâ€™s generating demand. Top recruits highlight videos generate millions of views sometimes people want a chance to conveniently watch them why not deliver that?
nba,ff5ebzf,t1_ff56a69,1579589256.0,Well heâ€™s on a team that has two of some of the top seniors in America and a few other nationally ranked players so they would be on TV regardless.
nba,ff5e94d,t1_ff540rf,1579589167.0,"Thereâ€™s no fucking way high schoolers should be getting paid lol. Even college is iffy, so high school is an even bigger no. Itâ€™s still a high school, so thereâ€™s still a handful kids on the end of the bench who are barely competent basketball players that you either have to unjustly pay or alienate them and not pay. The only thing you can do with amateur sports is allow players to use their likeness to make some money but contractual paying them is a slippery slope cause itâ€™s impossible to do it evenly. Thereâ€™s a couple guys and a couple teams really raking in the money but for the majority of other teams/players they definitely arenâ€™t.

Edit: itâ€™s okay, none of you know a thing about amateur athletics and of course you donâ€™tâ€”itâ€™s reddit."

nba,ff0l7nv,t1_fezycfj,1579469886.0,"Well that bigger market means a lot actually. And you guys have been in existence a lot longer, have had great players play for you, and have a championship before Curry. Curry definitely has been transformative to the franchise but that doesnâ€™t lessen my point that on the court heâ€™s not anymore impactful than a prime KG just in a different way."
nba,feztkjr,t1_fezg05g,1579461483.0,Definitely KG. Curry has just had the fortune of a bigger market and better franchise heâ€™s not single handedly more impactful.
