forza,ffft8ev,t1_ffe726k,1579891290.0,This week was better than last week for me because on my 2nd attempt I was in the team that won the 1st round so the 2nd round was already 6 vs 3 and 3rd round was 6 vs 1. Knowing my luck I used up all good fortune for the year and the next 2 weeks I'm always the last one to leave by 3rd round.
AskReddit,ffc5nuj,t1_ffc57zu,1579792106.0,Well even then people just handle death differently. My dad didn't cry outside of his mom's funeral. He of course was sad and missed her but he handled the loss differently than how my mom did. Nothing abnormal about it.
AskReddit,ffc41lc,t3_esps5n,1579791009.0,Being burned alive. It's hard to imagine a worse death than that when I don't exactly get threatened by the mexican cartel or something. The image of being stuck in a car that's on fire and I'm still awake is horrifying.
AskReddit,ffc3sap,t1_ffc30i2,1579790831.0,"I'd say it comes more down to how close you were and how sudden/unexpected the death was instead of you being abnormal.

My mom really struggled with losing her dad since they had gotten really close during the last few years and we were expecting him to be sent home from the hospital since it was planned he'd get out by xmas as he'd improved so much. And then one morning they instead called that he had passed. Grandma on the other hand went through Alzheimer's so my mom had done a lot of grieving before the actual death since she had pretty much lost her mom months prior to grandma's death."
gaming,ffbpzlt,t1_ffbl3ht,1579777921.0,"Your money wouldn't buy a fast connection in an area that doesn't support one unless you bought the ISP and decided on starting a development project in said area. Your pathetic $200/month gets you nowhere. But, of course, an actually educated person would know this."
gaming,ffbpoiz,t1_ffblng9,1579777488.0,So much this. There was a time when fibre was getting more and more popular here. Now I rarely ever see any mention of new areas getting covered by any sort of wired connections. Instead it's all about 4g and investing in 5g and they're even getting rid of cables in areas that used to have ADSL just a few years ago. With everyone forced to mobile there are some serious jams in the network and suddenly the speeds drop well below what they used to bo with wired. My parents are now stuck with jammed mobile and rarely see 16mb speeds anymore that they used to get with wired.

AskReddit,ff734fl,t3_es0vrp,1579640167.0,For me it's the sound the car handles of my dad's car made. I haven't heard it for 20 years yet I can still clearly play it in my head as if I could actually hear it right now.
AskReddit,ff5eqf4,t3_ero8mj,1579589712.0,"She'd be disappointed. 13 y o me had a clear goal: become a biologist. I dropped out of uni during the 1st year and now I'm working on getting my 3rd degree since the previous 2 yielded no results. I'm constantly worried about my ability to find a job after graduating. Yeah, she'd look at me and would probably end it in her teens before reaching this point."
forza,ff2d1q9,t1_ff24r72,1579501252.0,And if do miss it NEVER hit rewind. It's not functional in multiplayer as it just sends you at full speed to the place where you first ran off the track.
forza,fezbelr,t1_fezafvc,1579455668.0,"Collision detection off all race + what Natedoggsk8 suggested about the contact time with the wall and it could be so much better. No-one would be able to ram anyone anywhere and an unfortunate crash wouldn't trigger the penalty when wall riding clearly wasn't intended.

The only other Forza I played online was Horizon 2 on 360 and it was just playground games for an achievement so I gotta ask: was there always a penalty in these games or is it something more recent?"
forza,fez93i2,t1_fez7hxw,1579454989.0,My understanding is that the collision penalty is applied to the player hitting the wall and not the player who knocks someone into the wall in a case where player collision is the reason someone hits the wall. Ghosting is what prevents high speed ramming others into walls.
forza,fez86kp,t1_fez7li6,1579454703.0,"Yeah, that would be much better. A simple crash into the wall wouldn't trigger the penalty in that case and you could better get back into the race afterwards."
elderscrollsonline,fesr8m3,t3_eqifd3,1579368165.0,Ugh. I finally made some space for a recent update and get ready to play tonight just to have it constantly fail logging in. Just my luck. Every time I'm ready for some ESO there are world wide server problems.
AskReddit,feserbl,t1_fep2qid,1579364446.0,I saw him in 2018. His show was pretty good. Then I saw live footage of some other shows around the same time and they were really awful. I guess it's a 50/50 chance on getting a good show from him and we just got lucky.

I really loved the tabby one as a kid. Anything to further customize the experience always has my vote!"
forza,feqoe4h,t1_fekwboe,1579344194.0,I used the Lambo Urus with some 5 star offroad tuning and was constantly 1st or 2nd even tho I'm not usually the type to even race against unbeatable AIs.
forza,feo1stf,t1_femu2l3,1579294011.0,I used an x tuned Ariel Atom. I even messed up the try drifting to the finish and still managed to beat this zone.
forza,feo1h6k,t1_feo091w,1579293835.0,"I still have playground left. I finished one try, we lost 3-0, I was the only one in my team who actually scored flags and didn't just outright lose the crown instantly. If I can just find another competent team for that it's all good, at least it doesn't have AI randomness included."
forza,fenwrsb,t3_epkc65,1579292042.0,This is the 1st time I'm trying trials and boy do I hate them with a passion. I keep finishing 1st or 2nd but that still means nothing when my teammates finish last and constantly bring in 0-100 points. It took me around 10 tries to finally have a competent team in which we all pulled our weight and ended up winning. All these other challenges and events have been great so far but this co-op stuff just makes me question if I really want to go for the achievements tied to playlists.
xboxone,femxjbs,t1_femtmuy,1579272194.0,I wouldn't really compare a few extra hours or maybe working 12 days straight to the crunch time developers go through for possibly months. Going from 40 hours to 60 is nothing compared to 80-100/week.
UpliftingNews,femvq10,t1_femevqz,1579270868.0,"Still didn't stop them the first time around when Finland was made a part of the Russian empire or the 2nd time when Molotov-Ribbentrop pact promised Finland to Russia and the Winter war broke out. Russia definitely has an interest in Finland should tensions escalate as controlling Finland means easier access to Sweden and the Baltic Sea and no ground for their enemies to establish HQs so close to Russia. Also, while we spend ""under $4B"" on our military forces it's still around 1.2% of the GDP which is more than many other European countries. The border very much is a big deal which is why all men aged 18 still have to either do military or civil service to keep our defensive skills up-to-date."

space,fedo91y,t1_fedndqs,1579016283.0,So can I leave my end of the world bunker for now?
dataisbeautiful,fedo0mn,t1_fedmj03,1579016134.0,It's national.
dataisbeautiful,fednvdc,t1_fedm5l8,1579016040.0,If you're near the poverty line and don't live near Helsinki then you can have an ok life if ok to you means you can pay for the basics. If you're long term unemployed and have to constantly request social assistance it is bad as in it severely limits your life and makes it harder to fix the financial state you're in. But if all you care is comparing it to the States then it's not that bad. Really depends on what you set your standards at but I certainly hate being one of the 700k people and not anywhere near the Ä1230 limit.
dataisbeautiful,fedn56m,t1_fedlex9,1579015572.0,"First off, please don't refer to Finland as being Scandinavian.

With that out of the way, I really don't get the need to compare what poverty is around the world. If we really go down that path then a good chunk of the poor in the States have to reason to complain as they're still doing better than the poor in Africa or Asia. Yet it'd be absurd to think that way.

While it's better to be poor in most European countries than it is in the States, it's still a struggle and to belittle it changes nothing. And if you do get out of poverty/never been in it to begin with, chances are you're making more in the States than in Finland and can actually buy more due to a higher purchasing power. It's not all so simple when it comes to economics."
dataisbeautiful,fedjhpf,t1_fedhih9,1579013094.0,Well no-one has denied that. It still doesn't change the fact that it's an awful way to live and that a significant portion of the population is in poverty.
dataisbeautiful,fedj9x8,t1_fedheh8,1579012942.0,"If you work long enough over a period of time (26 weeks of at least 18 hrs/week and getting paid at least the minimum wage) you will get an earning's related benefit for 300, 400 or 500 days depending on your work history and age. For everyone else it's Ä33.66 for 5 days a week so Ä673.20/month.

On top of that you can get housing benefits (I get roughly Ä250/month, it's capped at 80% of acceptable housing costs so it definitely doesn't cover more than a portion of your rent) and social assistance if your bank account is pretty much at 0 so that you'll have at least Ä502 to spend after rent so it's not a benefit everyone is entitled to even if unemployed/student/whatever.

Edit: it's actually 21.5 days x 33.66 = Ä723.69
I also forgot to mention that this is before taxes which is at 20% on benefits."
dataisbeautiful,fedhzkg,t1_fedgybq,1579012015.0,"Well that is a pretty pointless comparison if that's what they're after. Poverty in Africa is worse than in the US, doesn't mean I'd want to be poor in the States. Just as I wouldn't want to be poor in Finland. Yeah, the poor can have a better life here but it's still far from a nice life and the fact that almost 700k out of 5.5m are living in poverty is pretty bad when the poverty line isn't set to some high number that even let's you save some of that income every month. Like I said, that Ä1230 isn't even enough for normal living in Helsinki area."
dataisbeautiful,fedgjio,t1_fedg1vr,1579010928.0,"Ä1230 is less than what you need to live a ""normal"" life in Helsinki (can pay your rent, bills, basic doctor's visits, don't have to skip meals) or the nearby areas and it's barely at the level of ""normal"" life elsewhere. For example the unemployed get well below 1230. Plenty of retired people get less than that as well. I really don't get the idea that the people living in poverty in Finland have it so great.

Also, not gonna comment on how the welfare is in Scandinavia as Finland isn't Scandinavian ;)"
dataisbeautiful,fedg2hh,t1_fedeyct,1579010559.0,"I still don't get your point. Just because poverty lines differ from country to country (the US poverty line is still better than a dollar a day some places have, doesn't mean poverty in the States is a non-issue) it doesn't mean that the poor here would live a life of luxury. USA also has a higher purchasing power and different costs of living."
dataisbeautiful,fedexf3,t1_fedeff3,1579009648.0,Well if Sweden falls it'll just make our situation even worse as they are a huge trade partner for us. Denmark and Germany at the very least have lower unemployment rates indicating that their economies are in a better shape than that of Finland.
dataisbeautiful,feddou3,t1_feddh3o,1579008615.0,What do you mean? Ä1230 isn't much with our cost of living.
dataisbeautiful,fedc7rs,t1_fedb0ay,1579007317.0,"The government doesn't care about us. If they did the middle class family wouldn't be the one paying for everything. Besides, almost 700k people live below the poverty line and there's only 5.5m of us. The future's looking pretty dim. Aging population, slow or non-existant economic growth, country getting more and more in debt. If I were you I'd rather choose Scandinavia or maybe Germany. I really feel like the ""happiest country"" is bullshit considering the number of people on anti depressants. Or maybe they just measure dumb things and ignore obvious issies, idk."
horror,fe3psuq,t1_fe3kwz1,1578851738.0,"Yeah. Here the TV stations have agreed to certain times when it's ok to broadcast 16+ (9 pm or later) or 18+ (11 pm or later) shows and movies. Too bad I've been nocturnal my whole life so while my parents went to sleep before 10 pm I'd sneak into the living room and watch all these movies and shows intented for an older audience while other kids my age were happily sleeping. I can also clearly remember watching The Blair Witch Project around that age and that, too, was quite an experience for a child, especially the ending when they reach the house."
aww,fe3g5c6,t1_fe2cmka,1578848985.0,I hit my head badly as a kid and needed stitches for the cut. The scar certainly is more sensitive and I hate when I forget that it exists and scratch my head carelessly. It just feels so... wrong in some weird way to scratch that area.
europe,fe3epgc,t1_fe3da8q,1578848619.0,Keeping it above 0 is nowhere near the same as wishing horrible heat waves and drought. Does it make you feel better if I tell you that I also wish it wouldn't get over 20∞C in the summer?
europe,fe350wf,t1_fe2zmzd,1578845993.0,"Yes, bring up the other extreme because that's clearly what I want. Southern Finland has never had consistent times when we have the first snowfall or for how long we have snow. A year like this is nice to experience when for the most part we have snowy Januaries. And we've had years when January has started with no snow just to get a thick snow cover by the end of the month. Just looking at Foreca already shows a chance of it snowing on the 21st where I live and the temperatures dropping to sub 0 well before that. Winter is definitely coming, February and March, even April, are still ahead of us. Plenty of time to get lots of snow and to experience the battery killing freezing temperatures."
