Like I said, this often gets ignored so we can assume some techno workaround that makes it not a big issue. However, the Intrepid class is supposed to be, at the time of its creation, Starfleet's fastest ship and able to sustain High Warp longer than others.

So, we can also assume the variable geometry is used to bring the nacelles closer together in a way that makes the ship's function at High Warp more efficient through the creation of a much more stable Warp Bubble then by normal means (techno workaround)."
