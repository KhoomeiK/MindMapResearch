therewasanattempt,ff65m0q,t1_fcoml8b,1579619694.0,"No lol. It’s normal but it’s still a change. The sudden shift in paradigms from you being the most important person in your life, to that being your child, is absolutely evolutionarily-incentivized brainwashing. Goes for guys too. Hormone levels change when you bond with a baby. I’m not saying “lose their ability to think rationally” but being willing to jump in front of a train to save a creature who can’t talk, can’t move, barely has a personality yet & you’ve known for all of a few days is pretty crazy. The whole reason we do is because evolution favors those who will sacrifice for their kids (so genes can propagate) regardless of who that kid actually is. See, also: people still loving their kids even when they become serial killers or protecting them when they’re serial rapists or other similar things. 

I’m not saying it’s BAD. For the human race to continue we basically have to love babies more than ourselves otherwise who the fuck would be caring for a little gremlin hand and foot for years. But if you take a step back yeah it’s fucking weird c’mon.

I mean hell, the hormones during birth LITERALLY are meant to make you forget/diminish how traumatizing or painful it is so you’re more willing to do it again. Just because it’s natural and biological doesn’t make it not wack.

Anyway, to be fair, it’s not that much less rational than falling in love with a shitty person."

Like saying “be a man” and she says “be a woman” instead. Or yes, grow a pair vs. grow a clit. Since the former is common vernacular few people consider it sexist. 

Like the phrase “don’t be a pussy” is still widely used and somehow not widely considered sexist but if we said “don’t be a tiny dick” instead somehow someone would probably be offended."

AskMen,fepw1ym,t1_femuf6h,1579333348.0,"It’s interesting cuz culturally I’m almost the exact opposite. In my family everything was family style, you get your own staple food (rice or noodles or what have you) but it was unimaginable that you would just... eat your one thing... instead of trying like 1/4 of everything ordered/made. In fact growing up I was basically taught to share every snack I had and such. You only stick to your own plate with people you aren’t familiar or close with, like coworkers or a first date where you’re trying to be formal. And of course it only applies to easily shareable food, entrees and apps, when there’s sufficient quantities. if you get like... soup... I’m not going to slurp some up or anything haha. Variety is the spice of life!

If my boyfriend demanded we keep all our food separate I’d be worried about our relationship. He’s always taking a bite or sip out of my food anyway (he has food intolerances but can handle a small amount). 

Sharing is literally caring, and food is love, so sharing food is like the pinnacle of that. If something looks tasty I want to try it, and if I’ve got something tasty I want to share it. 
Then again, it probably is mannerless, but I don’t think it’s disrespectful! We don’t really ask one another any more but I like it, it feels like a progression. Like... going from asking “can I kiss you” to making eyes at each other and making out == going from asking “can I have some” to making eyes at the food in question and taking a share hehe."

If you use it for punishment it’ll stress them out when you put them in there when you aren’t trying to punish them. Like, if you consistently put them in there when they do something wrong, and then visitors come and you put them in there to keep them out of the way, they’re gonna think they did something wrong.

But if you ONLY use it as punishment that’s fine.

I do the same thing, if my dog does something bad he gets time out for a few minutes (more is not necessary tbh they forget what they did pretty much immediately). Rest of the time he can go wherever he wants.

Same reason why you should never punish by grabbing them (I’ve seen people grab their dogs around the mouth to say “no”), because it just gives them a negative association with you reaching for them... it’s not that it’s bad for the dog, but it’s bad for training"

Maybe TMI but it doesn’t feel as good when I’m on top no matter what I do, it doesn’t really hit the right spot. The way it feels the best also means I can’t move much, which means like... the best thing for me is him moving perfectly for 25 minutes. Obviously that’s not possible haha so if he gets out of rhythm or something it kind of messes up my building orgasm. I know it’s not fair cuz it’s not like that’s his responsibility so I don’t complain if I don’t come, but it *is* kinda frustrating that he gets there literally every single time while I’m left wanting sometimes. He definitely does his part with foreplay and everything so I don’t think it’s something that can really be worked on. Maybe if I uncover some kink that helps me... 

All I can say is I used to think the whole idea that “women give men sex” or are sex gatekeepers was totally sexist bullshit and women enjoy sex just as much as guys and all that, but more and more I’ve felt like... I mean, a guy objectively gets more out of sex than I am lol. It’s not their fault! But like, that’s pretty much the whole reason why I don’t do casual sex (when I’m single) cuz personally for me I just won’t enjoy it enough or possibly at all. Obviously this is just me, many women do! Women with more efficiently built pleasure centers haha.

But personally, the only time I’ve felt overwhelmed by sex, the only time I felt that... completely sweeping wave of need and want... I was also tripping balls. So yeah, I’m jealous if that’s close to what guys feel *every time*."

Futurology,fcirm5k,t1_fcidhrv,1577668170.0,"Not to disparage what people experience every day but in most places you are in fact hugely unlikely to die due to color and sexuality. In fact the most likely way for you to die (even adjusting for race and sexuality) is heart disease followed by cancer, in the US at least, no matter what your race or sexuality. Even the people more at risk of dying by homicide due to intersectionality (transgender black individuals) are more likely to die in a motor accident. Hell, even in Mexico — where homicide is far more rampant — heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes still kill more. I don’t say this to belittle your point but if you live in a developed country, no matter your creed/whatever, now *is* probably the safest time to be you. It’s not perfect, it might not even be good, but it’s better. Except... uhhh Mexico, where homicide has gone up in the last decade (oof) but that can be explained more by political turnover and criminal groups."

The main two reason this wasn’t so in titanic is bc of how slowly it was sinking at first. There wasn’t much panic at first. People believed another ship within sight (the Californian) was coming to save them. Instead of the panic of a normal shipwreck where it’s every person for themself, they had time to think about their actions."
nottheonion,fcgspz2,t1_fcfqxzy,1577643628.0,Every rich person believes it’s not them it’s the richer more powerful people. I’ve talked to literal multi millionaires who hold your exact same mindset cuz they don’t see themselves as powerful when compared to their social group consisting of even richer people. At most they donate a small amount to feel better about themselves.
