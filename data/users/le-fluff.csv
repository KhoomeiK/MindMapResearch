I also introduced a dummy (pacifier) at that age, again, it was the only thing that calmed him. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do and ignore the myriad of information online!

baby,fegbdbo,t1_feg9qk5,1579086142.0,"Donâ€™t be disheartened by little one not smiling. I know itâ€™s horrible but itâ€™s not because baby doesnâ€™t love you :( 

Have you tried using a cup and trying to pour tiny bits of milk into babyâ€™s mouth? Thatâ€™s what Cherubs, a breastfeeding charity where I am in the U.K., recommend if they are on strike, or not latching properly, etc etc. Itâ€™s probably pretty fiddly but it may help? Or syringes? Very unromantic but again, saves baby going hungry :( 

First time mama here so might just be speaking rubbish. 

Good luck xxx"

The hormones, sleep deprivation and lack of routine can make mamaâ€™s head a sad and scary places, so expect a lot of crying and â€œI canâ€™t do thisâ€ moments. But you guys CAN do it! Make sure she is fed and watered and that she has a shower everyday. Honestly, having that morning shower felt like a holiday, and I always came out feeling a million times better.
