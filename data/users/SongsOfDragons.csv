aww,fcmnr1n,t1_fclr9nb,1577783315.0,"Don't worry, before we had our sproglet neither of us had any real baby experience either!

Newborns have a reflex known as the Moro Reflex, left over from our early primate days. If the baby thinks it's falling, it will flail its arms and cry - and wake up, because they Moro a lot in their sleep! (Yes we started using it as a verb). 

Swaddle blankets - you can wrap them using a folded square or you can get preformed pouchy velcro things which are much easier - hold their limbs in close to them which mimics how they slept in the womb, and prevents the Moro reflex. You have to be careful when swaddling to make sure their hips aren't bound too tightly as that could hurt them. Esti slept so much better in one than just being put down. Swaddling is also one of the myriad things to do (as opposed to not do, of which we were doing none, yay!) that helps prevent SIDS, or cot death.

As for the arms going up, that's not the Moro. That's 'I'm free!! Time for a nice stretch!' 'Cause as much as the swaddle is comforting to them it does make them keep their arms in the same position for a while.

Esti would often break an arm free with some struggling against the swaddle when she was still awake - when she started doing it all the time, it was one of the signs we should start transitioning her out of it. But what was funny was that she would often struggle but end up with her arms wodged down by her sides. Silly boo."

aww,fckv8ii,t3_ehoi33,1577733923.0,"Our little's five months now but she's been out of the swaddle since early November. She used to do this - arms up and stretch - whenever you undid the velcro. She also used to kick her legs so she would turn, and we'd often find her rotated 180 or more. (You spin me right round, baby...) Then she started rolling around in it and fighting her way out of it so we transitioned her to a sleepsack."

It also covers loads of oils, including weirdy ones I've never seen, and also including ones that have no place in the home like wormwood and fuckin' turpentine!"
