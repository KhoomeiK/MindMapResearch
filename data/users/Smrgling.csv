bonehurtingjuice,ff7f512,t1_ff76r3s,1579648115.0,Yeah I'm not saying you shouldn't. Just to recognize that many people partake in activities or expression that is not strictly gender-conforming. As long as you respect people it doesn't matter
bonehurtingjuice,ff780bu,t1_ff6ze79,1579642924.0,"Progressive gender theory doesn't claim that there are more than two genders, it claims that each gender (masculinity and femininity) is not an absolute yes-or-no you-are-this-or-that thing but instead a variable for which you have a specific value. Thus the claim of ""more than two genders"" is in reality simply the claim that ""on a 2D plane there are more than two points"". You simply have a different understanding of what the word gender means to you than people do who say >2 genders. Consider how The Rock is more masculine than Jeff Goldblum for example and you will understand the meaning of ""masculinity exists as a spectrum rather than an absolute""

Under that context non-binary may make more sense to you."
bonehurtingjuice,ff776dy,t1_ff6zlnq,1579642464.0,"Non-binary is considered to be a transgender gender identity. This is because a non-binary person's gender identity is different from that which they were assigned at birth. Linguistically the prefix ""trans"" means across so I understand why you might think it refers to the binary trans experience, but that js not the way it is used within the context of gender theory n' such"
bonehurtingjuice,ff76khf,t1_ff73qzl,1579642119.0,"It probably doesn't help that you're thinking of it in numbers. Gender is, broadly, a mixture of identification and presentation. It can't really be quantified into numbers but someone might for example want to wear dresses and also grow a beard. Each of those things is seen as gendered by society, and non-binary identity is at its core just people who want to do things that don't fit in strictly with the dualism that society sees masculinity / femininity as.

Also consider that nobody is actually strictly binary in their gender. Cis guys wearing nail polish or cis women watching football are inherently just a little bit non-binary. The difference for people who identify as non-binary is that instead of being seen as a man/woman who is slightly non-conforming they would prefer being seen as someone who is not inherently gendered in the first place because the things that they like or identify with are more distributed between masculinity and femininity than society tells them that they should be.

Hopefully that helps. I am not myself non-binary so I can't give you a firsthand explanation but based on what I know from my friends who are I believe this to be fairly accurate."

transhumanism,ff1qo5t,t1_ff1lqsv,1579484049.0,The community doesn't even exist yet and you're assuming a priori that they will be discriminated against should they exist in the future. That's the disagreement I have with this whole concept. You can't support a group of people that literally does not exist yet to receive your support.
transhumanism,ff1km2j,t1_ff1f29i,1579480703.0,"Be careful with that statement about gender and sexual identity being about wants. Gay men aren't gay because they ""want to have sex with men"" but because they *are* attracted to men. Trans women don't ""want to present as women"" they *are* women because of their personal gender identity.

Whether homosexuality is a choice or not is irrelevant to whether homophobes are correct or not (they're not) because homophobia is discrimination based on who someone *is* not based on what they believe.

I guess we will have to disagree about whether discrimination based on voluntary amputation will occur or not cause in reality there's no evidence to believe either outcome since it doesn't exist in reality right now and fiction like Deus Ex is not necessarily representative of society's response to a technology.

I guess I just think it's pretty premature to create a pride flag as if transhumanism faces the same challenges that gender and sexual minorities do. That's likely why the other commenter was offended. You've claimed the victim hood and suffering of a community which faces real life or death challenges for your/our/this ideology which as of right now faces no such suffering of its own. It makes light of real people's struggles which can be hurtful."
transhumanism,ff0wagp,t1_fezv9hk,1579472869.0,Let's move this discussion over to my other response to you so as not to flood the thread with this discussion. I believe that my other comment adequately explain the difference between discrimination based on identity (faced by gender and sexual minorities) vs agenda (what would be faced by transhumanists/transhumans) but if you disagree please respond to my other comment
transhumanism,ff0vigd,t1_fezt2ow,1579472701.0,"It's because ""transhuman"" isn't an identity. It's a goal, or an agenda or whatever you want to call it but if you say ""I am a Transhumanist"" what you're saying is that you want technological progress and body modification and all that stuff under the umbrella of the term transhumanism. This is different from gender or sexual identity because those are descriptions of who someone is (one can say that they *are* a gender or that they *are* gay and it isn't a statement about wanting something but about being something).

I do have a reason to think otherwise and that is because people can look at the results of the transhuman goal and see immediately how they can help people. The fact that combat veterans with amputated limbs exist is enough to convince the vast majority of people that developments of prosthetics is a good idea. Very few people actually disagree with the core conceit of transhumanism which is that better understanding and interfacing with the human body benefits people."
transhumanism,fez8xww,t1_feyvqoo,1579454949.0,"Pride flags aren't stupid edgy flags, they exist for solidarity in communities that are constantly harassed and assaulted by bigots. I do agree though that transhumanism doesn't need one because nobody gets harassed for being a transhumanist"
