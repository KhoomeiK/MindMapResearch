They account for the vast majority of gun deaths, and they serve no practical purpose when it comes to self defense when shotguns are an option. We need far more restrictions on who has access to weapons, and we need to shift focus to the weapons that actually kill people."

Good nights could see me come home with over $300. Plus if by some chance I didn't, I was still guaranteed the $13.50, and later $15 minimum wage. 

Waiting tables can be even better. If you get a party of 4, a typical meal is going to be, at an absolute minimum, $100, probably closer to $200 or even $300. if they don't get the cheapest things on the menu and order an appetizer and drinks. That's $20-$60 right there, plus their 3 or 4 other table that they have at that time. If you get 10 tables in a night, you can go home with around $400 in tips on a good night."
