nailbiting,feuz1ec,t3_eqdsi2,1579391366.0,"currently wearing acrylics on my little nubs! grew me nails put for about 2 weeks before getting them done to give them a length boost, and my nail tech literally didn't bat an eyelid.

they aren't there to judge you, they are there to accommodate you! maybe bring a friend along as well, it helps ease your self consciousness :)?"
alevel,femt2nq,t1_femri51,1579268815.0,"i know how you feel, but if you explain to them the extent of your struggles do you think they might budge? it is in your best interests after all :/"
alevel,femn2qh,t3_epz51u,1579263265.0,"get a tutor! there's no shame in it, and more people use them than you think :)

either ask friends for recommendations, or look online. there are a lot of uni undergrads looking to earn a little extra if you're looking for something cheap!"
nailbiting,fem1x9z,t3_epv9kv,1579237085.0,"mine were pretty much the same length as urs and this will be my 4th week of not biting :) i went for:

1) grow nails out for two weeks just self motivation 
2) get acrylic nails put on (book appt 2wks before so you have a goal)
3) get in-fills every 3wks, 3 times (~11wks of growth)
4) get them taken off and start strengthening treatments and such (at this point they will be past the end of your finger!)

ill probably keep mine painted nice so i won't want to spoil them and get a set of gels if there's an anxious event coming up :)

this may leave your nails a but thin at the end, but if yours are anything like mine, they're gonna be thin as heck already so it doesn't make that much of a difference.

hope this helped :) x"

6thForm,fdyvq4b,t3_en8zav,1578784041.0,"aight i have no idea what your topic is, so this is ambiguous as f*ck, but something like:

‚Ä¢ introduction - what is your question about, how do you intend to answer it, to what extent has it already been answered, what factors limit your research of this topic etc.

‚Ä¢ point 1 (secondary research)

‚Ä¢ counterpoint 1/ arguement / contradicting evidence

‚Ä¢ criticism of point and counterpoint - where are the authors/creators of your secondary research limited, what context may affect each point (timescale, technology, funding, social class etc.)

^^ repeat for your important points

‚Ä¢ primary research (if possible/needed) - probably include charts and graphs with explanation and a copy of any surveys/questionnaires you made

‚Ä¢ analysis of primary research, criticism of boundaries, how this affects your conclusion etc.

‚Ä¢ your opinions (if valid? probably not for law cases and things where you don't really have much supporting knowlege)

‚Ä¢ conclusion - a comparison of your secondary research points and counterpoints along with a clearly explained process of elimination and a decision of which is most likely/most supported, as well as your primary research. your final decision on the answer to your question.

‚Ä¢ bibliography/ references

honestly, this isn't great cause idk what you're doing, but this is a general structure. what is ur topic? maybe i can help u more if i knew :/"
6thForm,fdysnqw,t3_ene9ng,1578783181.0,"so it's a 5000-word research essay with a presentation at the end. you spend a couple of months researching a topic of your choice using primary and secondary research (e.g. questionnaires, quizzes, Google scholar, scientific journals) and come to a conclusion in your essay, referencing all your sources.

the presentation is about 10mins long of you talking about how you went about your research, what you found, why it's important to you etc, and then a small audience (maybe a handful of teachers and friends) ask you questions.

most people choose questions as topics related to their studies, e.g. a physics student might ask ""what is the effect of dark energy on the expansion of the universe"", or a law student might ask ""what is the bias towards men in child custody cases"".

others may choose topics outside of study to broaden their studies, like football or music or something. you can also produce an ""artifact"" instead of an essay, which is usually what music, film and art-based EPQ topics are. it depends what you're interested in, really.

a lot of unis like so see people adding to their studies with EPQ, and it's worth more UCAS points than an AS-level at grade A.

any other questions feel free to ask :)"

nailbiting,fdnlwgr,t3_em31ki,1578588531.0,"my method has been (my nails were all about the size of your index nail) to try my best to grow them out for two weeks, and then get acrylic nails. I keep doing infills every 3 weeks until about 9/10weeks have passed and then i will have them taken off and the nail underneath will be at the end of my finger :)

this works if you can't get past ~2 weeks on your own and you will end up with quite thin nails from the acrylics. my plan from then on is working on keeping them long and strengthening them ;)

hope this helps x

edit: for context I've tried growing my nails out with just self motivation many many times, so this is a method for last-ditch attempts üòÇ"

SkincareAddiction,fd8rnvt,t3_ek8gs1,1578222429.0,"Just stopped using antibiotic Lymecycline (17F) and a topical treatment, Epiduo, that goes with (have been using it for months with really really good results, but not really allowed to constantly take antibiotics). 

My skin is breaking out again! Arhh!!!!!! I saw it coming, but I've had almost-clear skin for ages thanks to the antibotics and I thought I was finally past this. I'm getting lots of pustules and a handful of deep painful cyst spots on my forehead, hairline, nose, around the top of my cheeks near my nose, and chin.

My skin type is oily and a bit dehydrated.

Current routine:

AM

‚Ä¢ Cetaphil cleanser

‚Ä¢ CeraVe moisturiser with hyaluronic acid

‚Ä¢ Cetaphil SPF50+ suncream under eyes


PM

‚Ä¢ Cetaphil cleanser

‚Ä¢ Epiduo topical treatment (it has benzoyl peroxide or something in it)

‚Ä¢ CeraVe moisturiser

‚Ä¢ 1 drop baobab skin oil

other:

‚Ä¢ change pillowcase every few days

‚Ä¢ have a towel specifically for face

‚Ä¢ eat relatively healthy

‚Ä¢ not currently exercising (and don't really have time atm)

I've been doing this routine for the best part of a year now.

I am super stressed at the moment, which might be influential, but I feel like these symptoms are pretty normal for me. No big changes. 

17F in the UK, any help would be MUCH appreciated :)"
