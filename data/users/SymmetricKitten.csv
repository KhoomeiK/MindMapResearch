AskReddit,few77zv,t1_fetsinh,1579406323.0,"Similar story: I went to work one morning without cigs, I had run out. I smoked Camel Menthol Lights and this was 1999 or maybe right after, they weren’t common yet. I cleaned hotel rooms and I walked into this room that was trashed. I mean furniture overturned, mattress off the bed, TRASHED. I sighed and started righting what I could before calling for help. I opened the dresser drawer, the top one, to clean it out and BAM! There’s a FULL pack of Camel Menthol Lights."

AmItheAsshole,feh6o7f,t1_fef2niy,1579110266.0,I agree with you TruthOnly and came to see if anyone else said this. I’m glad you did. Parents sacrifice abundantly. OP might just need to swallow his pride even though his Dad assumed. He may have assumed just because it was the most logical decision.
