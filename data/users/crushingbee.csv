Even after your recovery, you'll still feel the bar in your chest and it feels like you're less 'flexible'. Noone can decide for you whether you should do it or not. I just want to give you this: they will make it look all easy etc at the hospital but it's a big surgery with a big impact."
PectusExcavatum,fdrvk2e,t3_emvmwz,1578690348.0,Sorry I can't really imagine how it flipped. It looks like it's sticking out of your body???
PectusExcavatum,fdqjcf8,t1_fdq8wz8,1578668084.0,Yeah ofcourse I'm serious

PectusExcavatum,fdpxesb,t3_emnakj,1578644573.0,Man I would defenitely see a docter. It looks like that's a super deep hole. Do you have trouble breathing? I would consider surgery.
PectusExcavatum,fdmymqo,t1_fdm11jt,1578571521.0,Google pectus excavatum. Does that look anything like your chest? What would you do if people here said yes...? What's the use?
PectusExcavatum,fdjiqr5,t3_elhy76,1578472678.0,I think for people who actually have PE this subr does more harm than good because of these people who just post their chest with a little dent

It might be a consequence of my own actions, maybe if I actively try to make it better then it will feel better between us again? If that makes sence? I feel like I'm going to regret it if I end it."
relationships,fcdq2hr,t1_fcdlgdo,1577612429.0,"I apologised for it. Yes you're right, it wasn't funny and I do regret it. We don't get along as good as we used to. I don't want to have discussions on NY eve, thats why I don't want to celebrate it together. But that's probably only making it worse."
relationships,fcdkr1j,t1_fcdhv75,1577610951.0,"Yes she has met my friends. But if I'm spending alot of time with one friends for example, she'll complain that I left her alone with the rest of my friends etc. I just want to catch up with all of them without having to worry about my girlfriend all the time."
relationships,fcdhoi5,t1_fcdfhlr,1577610126.0,"Well for example, 2 nights ago she wanted to have sex and usually I want too but but I just didn't feel like it. So then she got mad at me for not wanting to have sex. At christmas she got me presents and there was a card inside the box along with other big presents. So I put the card aside and went for the other presents. I told her sarcastically ""Thats just paper"". She got mad over that too. Had to explain that it was just a joke. It just really kills the vibe. I want new year to be just fun without being carefull all the time about what I'm doing."
PectusExcavatum,fc7vwii,t1_fc6dub6,1577520021.0,Hmm that's not too old but already pretty late. That might be why it's going a bit difficult.
PectusExcavatum,fc6a0id,t1_fc377ks,1577475708.0,How old is your wife? The older you are the longer and the more difficult the recovery is.
getdisciplined,fc36gc7,t1_fc346fq,1577382602.0,Good luck :)
getdisciplined,fc36fbs,t1_fc328wa,1577382583.0,Oh cocaine is great
getdisciplined,fc324db,t1_fc31h7d,1577379698.0,"Well I think it's too late for that now, but good advice."
getdisciplined,fc3202e,t1_fc309ws,1577379618.0,I wouldn't recommend playing on your phone in your breaks. It just doesn't feel refreshing to me. I have to study for 3 weeks everyday atm and i'm learning to juggle in my short breaks. Takes all my attention off the subject I'm studying.
getdisciplined,fc31pgd,t1_fc2zotj,1577379432.0,"Coffee should not be your source of energy. Eat healthy, exercise in your breaks (I have to study all day and this is the *best* way to get rid of all your fustrations). A 30min run is great. When your body is in good shape you will notice that it will be easier to study. But depending on coffee - no."

Hi. I'm sorry to hear about your wife's suffering. I got nussed myself this summer. My surgery went well, and I had minimal pain. However 3 weeks after the surgery when I was doing just fine, I got very bad back pain, out of nowhere. With each breath it felt like I got stabbed in my back. It's better now but overall I still have a bit backpain and every now and then it gets worse. The surgeon told me it can take up to a year for your body to fully adjust to the bar. Don't forget we have a frickin metal bar in our body. I honestly can't give you great advice. With time the pain will better. I got morphine, did your wife get that too?? I hope your wife gets better soon!"
