evangelion,ff2rl8z,t3_erbjxr,1579521001.0,"The font isn't monospaced, so we can only deduce a range of the number of letters which might be obscured. Assuming most or all of the redacted area contains lettering, we can say that there are between 7-8 letters if no I's are present or up to 9-10 letters including a space if I's are present. 

&#x200B;

Our most interesting clue comes from the space taken up by space characters, which appears uniform, and approximately half a full character. You'll notice that there is a little cleft in the redaction just after the ampersand. If the redacted text started with any letter other than J, T, X, Y, and possibly S or V we would see it.

Given that Mari's full name is used, we can assume that the second party would be likewise titled, unless they were using a codename or nom de guerre.

One interesting possibility is the name YUI IKARI which has almost exactly the right characters, and begins with a permitted letter. It's established in the originals that souls could be recovered from EVA cores as long as they were sane and willing to return. Perhaps WILLE, which is in possession of unit 01, was able to salvage Yui after she no longer had desired to remain in Unit 01 to safeguard Shonj."

That is to say, their rights aren't enshrined, they're not even recognised let alone accepted in institutions from cradle to grave, being trans isn't trendy like being LGB and they get their human rights crushed in courts, workplaces and general public.
