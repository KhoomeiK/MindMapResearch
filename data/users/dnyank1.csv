""That's, like, your opinion, though."" Legal scholar here - the Fifth Amendment provides us the right to not testify against ourselves, or to be compelled to self-incriminate. There's solid ground for making our digital devices fall under that protection as well - between secret FISA courts which, for example, authorized mass-surveillance of American citizens by the NSA and the ever-increasing degree to which our devices our privy to our actions to the point where they *anticipate our actions* as features...
