news,fdj9557,t3_elh7hb,1578462048.0,"He is a minor so I don't care for the doxxing that happened, but I do find it interesting that the school shipped these kids to protest, and let them be disrespectful to native persons during the protest. So the heck are they doing punishing the kid for following their directions? Why is he being punished for the school's failure? wow."

bipolar,fcakchq,t3_egodtu,1577570890.0,"Recently, I was shunned by three separate communities. It triggered a bipolar psychotic episode so bad that I'm still recovering more than 2 months later. The first four weeks I wanted to not exist because living through this seemed too difficult. The last four weeks were a pity party and grief with seeking out help. With some time to reflect and absorb some literature on my diagnosis, as well as guidebooks on shunning, I've found that resilience in self preservation is key. Why am I telling you this? I'm tired too but I know this can't be it. Quotes that have helped me during my process are: ""Because the only way out is through"" (Robert Frost)  and  ""There are far, far better things ahead than anything we leave behind."" (CS Lewis). You've got to get through the hardest time to get to the good stuff. Its just ahead. You have options for treatment to get out of cycling, including free shit like youtube meditation, to get you out of your own head and feeling controlled by your mood disorder.  We are more than the sum of our illness and you will get through this."
