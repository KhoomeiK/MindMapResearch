movies,fdm3w5y,t1_fdlpyow,1578539186.0,That is why I say until public opinion is directed towards non animal based products the only thing that can be done is to make the process better. Do you even read?
movies,fdljedq,t1_fdlhrpt,1578525332.0,"6months for us, and yes, for the calves safety, but as I said, we are trying to change this. I like how you ignored that by the way. Not everyone is trying to change. But some of us are. By trying to reintroduce the mothering instinct(currently they do not like them trying to feed and will kick them) and as I said it will take a while. The most we do is twice per day, and that's only for a couple of months per year, being dry is a longer time period than producing. I dont entirely disagree with you, but, when you work in an industry and actually understand the finer details of course you're gonna get defensive. But I'm here to attempt to educate, and I dont believe I can change people's views, but I can at least give them more information. Unfortunately not everyone is as forward as us, but one can only hope we can move towards a better way, maybe eventually not needing it at all."
movies,fdle0cp,t1_fdl9zw4,1578522002.0,"Read my reply to the other guy my dude, it's been generations of breeding that makes some of this necessary, our Bobby calves get sold to other farms for stock replenishment, we try to avoid having to send them to the works(its a waste, and the meat isn't even used here) artificial insem is on it's way out, bull only, and we're trialing around the country with reintroducing the mother cows to remaining with the calves until they're weaned(breeding has made them poor mothers) Its gonna take along time and be a hard road but some of us are trying to make it better. At least until public/industry opinion is actually opened to viable alternatives."
movies,fdldl1j,t1_fdl84m2,1578521745.0,"I am a dairy farmer so I know a lot about it. Guess what if you're hard on the animals and mistreat them you dont get milk. My farm doesnt feedlot, they live outside, eat freely, they are only on the milking platform for maybe 10minutes total a day, they're happy. The calves are taken away for their own safety(it wasnt us that bred the cows to be bad at mothering but here we are, gonna take years to re breed them to being good at it again, but we're trying) we need to fix how it's done, and unfortunately its gonna be decades before the entirety of the public and other industries swing to any other opinion so its gotta still be a thing. I guess if what you see is the bad(which is usually the case, the bad overcomes the view of the true norm) I can understand your point however, but there are those of us trying to change it for the better, whilst still feeding people. Lots of farms in nz are changing how it's done to make it better, easier and more relaxed for the girls."
