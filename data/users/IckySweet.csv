dogs,ffij0fx,t3_etf2nf,1579975023.0,"It's really hard in a dog kennel situation for some dogs to not get habituated to barrier barking. Also hard to find enough volunteers for each dog to even have one 'walk' a day outside the kennel. 

I think the key is more fostering families and the volunteers time used for a group 'obedience' class. It of course benefits a dog to get out of the kennel once a day for human attention but they need more because they're usually ok with the solo human attention part of kennel life. 

It would be very good for the dog during that out of kennel time to be on leash in a group class practicing basic commands.

The verbiage of adoption listings is pretty standard to try tomake a dog as desirable as possible to a layman. It's really the pictures that 'sell' the dog. My vent would be the quality of the pictures in some of these rescues."

Get him his own bed, blanket or pad for sleeping. Anyway you can let him sleep (on his dog-bed bed) in your room? you could place a crate in your bedroom for sleeping if you're worried he would wander at night.

I suggest if you want him to stay in a room alone or home alone that you use a large dog exercise pen for confinement times. That way he won't tear-up doors or get into trash or bad habits while he is alone. Be sure he has something to chew on you only give him when he's spending alone time in the ex-pen.

Both these companies also have programs where you save the weight circles off the packages and earn discounts. 

I also suggest because these are street dogs to try to get some wormer tablets/powder/liquid from a local vet and twice a year or so worm them for common worms. Mix it in their food.

edited to add. I noticed you mentioned feeding bread. Cooked rice, cooked oatmeal, cooked eggs may also be a fairly inexpensive way to stretch the feeding budget.
