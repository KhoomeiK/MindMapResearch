Hi, I'm currently working full-time as well. I teach coding to elementary school students. I love what I do and it's nice to hear the students say ""thank you Mr. Apple"" at the end of the day. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Also shy but not to that extent.

I'm from Latin America. Y el ingl√©s no es mi primer lenguaje. Spanish is. And I'm trying to learn French.

Japan sounds really cool! Why Japan specifically?

Science is really dope. Especially psychology. I love to read psychology books in my free time and learn more about just how complex the brain is. La cerveza y el alcohol son deliciosas! üòÇ

Que interesante que est√°s encantada en la ciencia de computadoras! Yo amo las computadoras y la programaci√≥n. I do Front End Development and am currently looking to enter the market without a degree. (not so easy but worth the challenge!)

No me gusta Harry Potter para nada.

Hopefully we start a new friendship!"

reactjs,fdjaaug,t3_elhak3,1578463091.0,"Nice! Like someone else said, I love the UI. My app itself could use some more color. 

I would try dabbling with some Context (it's a bit early for Redux) so that you have more separation of concerns in your code. An important goal in React is to make the components as dumb as possible. So handle the async logic outside and let the components receive the results as props.

Also the privateroute component would be better being in its own file. Try making sure that each file has only one component. Easier for accessing each one (no need to search and find that SearchBar.js contains the CustomButton component) and focusing on just one thing at a time.

There is a function inside the LandingPage component for user check. It's defined then immediately executed (why didn't you use IIFE instead?) This is better done in a useEffect hook. Inside such hook, make a variable equal to the function that checks for the user. And then run the function afterwards on component unmount to clean it up. This is Firebase-specific where functions return cleanup functions.

Pages can be inside their own folder.

In useState, it's a convention for the setter function to be prefixed with ""set."" So if you have ""logged"" like on line 6 in LandingPage, the setter would (by convention) be ""setLogged."" Again, just a convention.

There are a few other minor things that I wouldn't stress over.

All in all, I really like what you did with this project and would love to get my hands on it when the API works.
