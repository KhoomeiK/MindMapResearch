You watched the movie, found out that all the monsters were essentially being released by a secret government group, and that while the monsters were real, the actual intent was that the teens needed to be sacrificed.  But that they had to follow the rules, such as the slut going first, and the virgin lasting till the end and being the only one who *might* survive.  That similar institutes around the world were doing the same thing to children or teens in their areas, and that if no sacrifice was made, if *all* the groups survived, then the world would be destroyed by the Old Gods.

worldnews,fd2slyv,t1_fd2p9hm,1578151287.0,There's a difference in taxing new income and taxing the net worth that someone already has.
worldnews,fd2sd29,t1_fd2lsso,1578151214.0,"I'm not sure about why they failed in Europe, but a real, hardcore progressive income tax, along with capital gains taxes that are actually enforced, would be better. 

I don't think that billionaires need to exist, but it is *very* ingrained in a lot of people that you don't change the rules after the fact.

A wealth tax comes after money he is already worth.  He'd be taxed on stocks he owns every year, based on the worth of those stocks, even if he wasn't selling those stocks or doing anything with them.

People are going to fight *much* harder against the idea of taking what they already *have*.  It will be harder to win against them, especially when they have a fairly reasonable-sounding argument behind them: ""I already earned this money.""  Whether or not you think they actually *do* deserve the money, that is going to be very persuasive.  

A better idea is to tax any *gains* they make.  Gates is worth like 107 billion dollars, but most of that is in stock.  So tax him when he sells that stock, or converts it into something useful.  Tax him based on how much the value increased since the last time he paid taxes on it.  Essentially an income tax, but one that appropriately considers things like investments.

On the normal income front, while it's much less important compared to capital gains for these sorts of people, don't cap the highest tax bracket at the hilariously low $500,000.  That means that someone who makes 500k a year is being taxed for that final bracket (anything over 500) at 37%.  But someone who's making 20 million a year is being taxed at that same level.

Make that higher.  In the 60s, anything over a certain amount was taxed at something like 90%.  Bring stuff like that back.

Create a system that discourages billionaires from existing and that forces the existing ones to pay heavily into the system if they want to continue using their wealth.  That will be infinitely easier than a wealth tax, which is essentially storming their gates and taking the money they already have.  That might sound sexy, but it would be very difficult in a political and cultural sense.  It would *very* possibly require a constitutional amendment, which would be almost impossible.

We already have systems and taxes that can be altered to affect the rich appropriately."

Yes, it was a mostly plotless 2 hours where people danced and sang about how they sure were cats alright.

Exactly like the stage show. Which I also like.

It's just happy and whimsical. It's dancing for dancing's sake. I liked how when someone did a jump that requires wires, you could see them get 'caught' by the wire and pulled into the air. The wire was CGIed out of course, but it was a reminder that the motions in the show were actually being done. That the dancers were real people with CGI makeup, so the dances were essentially real. They weren't just CGI models that could obviously do any feat of dance without effort, possible or no. 

I can totally understand why someone wouldn't like that. It's two hours of mostly plotless singing about being cats. Of course a lot of people aren't into that. But it's identical to the stage show in that way. It's literally just a really high budget version of the musical.  It's a lot like the 1998 movie, which was just a version of the stage show where they filmed multiple camera angles, did some close-ups, and added some special effects that couldn't be done on stage.

I guess spoilers for the very basic plot that exists. 

That's essentially exactly what you get from the new movie. This is what Cats should be. I don't know what people thought it would be.

funny,fc04bqo,t1_fc033op,1577277931.0,"The people who celebrated Saturnalia are the same people who celebrated Christmas.

After Christianity became popular in Rome, it went fairly smoothly. Lots of Roman texts that equate Jesus with Apollo, that sort of thing.

Christianity was resisted at first because it wasn't considered a real religion. The Romans were essentially tolerant toward other religions, but part of how they defined that was that a religion had to be old. Something new wasn't a religion, it was just some crazy people being in a cult. 

But as it became more popular, especially when the wealthy and powerful began getting into it, more writers began talking about how Christianity wasn't really *different.* There are texts that say things like, ""We know that Zeus created and controls all the universe, the being we call Zeus is the same being that the Christians worship."" (By the later part of the Roman empire, belief in a large pantheon of gods was not popular in educated circles. Neoplatonism was very big into the idea of ""the One,"" which made belief in a literal pantheon more of a rural, poor thing. The elite were more likely to talk about how the other gods were metaphors for aspects of a single, all-encompassing entity.

(Then you get a *lot* of discussion and argument about whether Christ is identical to God or an aspect of God or separate from God or whatever. When the primary holy text doesn't give a reasonable explanation for that, it's easy to get some big arguments going on. One person wrote something like, ""you can't even buy a loaf of bread today without getting into an argument about the nature of Christ!"" But that's me going off on a tangent.)

So once you even had emperors being vocally Christian, Christianity spread very quickly.

And people don't like giving up holidays. Once you stop talking about Saturn and start talking about Christ, it's easy to switch over. Especially when the solstice is traditionally a birthday for important people."
