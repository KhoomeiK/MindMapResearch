A semi automatic chambers a new round for you on every trigger pull as well. So bolt action, pump action, or lever action weapons would not qualify.

I'll let you look up the numbers and you can figure out if you should be standing behind the claim that 99% of guns are semi automatic."

One of them wanted to be a paramedic firefighter and spent a couple years working towards that before he decided he wanted to be a nurse instead. So he spent another year working towards that and then decided he didn't like school. He has been delivering pizzas ever since. He has tried a couple times to get into a different career, like selling cars, but he always ends up delivering again. My other roommate never had a direction in college. He used his entire GI Bill and has no degree and didn't learn anything useful. He works for his county now, and makes enough to get by. I knew exactly what I wanted to do in college, and I got my degree, and now I'm a computer engineer. The recruiter never promised me that. He just told me I'd get 4 years of college for free, and it was my choice how I used that. I have a whole facebook full of other veteran friends who are everything from engineers and airline pilots to unemployed and living at mom's house. One thing is for sure, I wouldn't have been able to get an engineering degree without joining the military."

It's the people that peddle conspiracies about the government wanting to take their guns that are the problem. Those same people that feel the need to open carry their AR15 in people's neighborhoods and then give the police a hard time when they inevitably show up. Those same people that forcibly occupy a ranger station and then draw down on law enforcement officers when they're confronted. The people who need to attend a gun rights rally are exactly the people that I don't want to see with guns. The FBI already arrested 3 people who were planning on attending. No doubt they overlooked plenty of other lunatics, or freedom fighters, or whatever you guys are calling yourselves these days. And no, I won't find somewhere else to live.

And it will keep happening like that until you can only fit a couple games and need a new hard drive. This is literally what has been happening for decades. The latest version of Doom is 2000x larger than the original. I was playing that version of Doom on my first HD which was 800 MB at the time. A HD which is 2000x the capacity is 1.6TB. In other words, HD capacity has grown accordingly, and will continue to.

A semi automatic chambers a new round for you on every trigger pull as well. So bolt action, pump action, or lever action weapons would not qualify. Nor do revolvers, in which the user chambers every round themselves. Or any muzzle or breach loading weapons. I'll let you look up the numbers and you can figure out if you should be standing behind the claim that 99% of guns are semi automatic."

One of them wanted to be a paramedic firefighter and spent a couple years working towards that before he decided he wanted to be a nurse instead. So he spent another year working towards that and then decided he didn't like school. He has been delivering pizzas ever since. He has tried a couple times to get into a different career, like selling cars, but he always ends up delivering again. My other roommate never had a direction in college. He used his entire GI Bill and has no degree and didn't learn anything useful. He works for his county now, and makes enough to get by. I knew exactly what I wanted to do in college, and I got my degree, and now I'm a computer engineer. The recruiter never promised me that. He just told me I'd get 4 years of college for free, and it was my choice how I used that. I have a whole facebook full of other veteran friends who are everything from engineers and airline pilots to unemployed and living at mom's house. One thing is for sure, I wouldn't have been able to get an engineering degree without joining the military."

It's the people that peddle conspiracies about the government wanting to take their guns that are the problem. Those same people that feel the need to open carry their AR15 in people's neighborhoods and then give the police a hard time when they inevitably show up. Those same people that forcibly occupy a ranger station and then draw down on law enforcement officers when they're confronted. The people who need to attend a gun rights rally are exactly the people that I don't want to see with guns. The FBI already arrested 3 people who were planning on attending. No doubt they overlooked plenty of other lunatics, or freedom fighters, or whatever you guys are calling yourselves these days. And no, I won't find somewhere else to live. I have no reason to run."

And it will keep happening like that until you can only fit a couple games and need a new hard drive. This is literally what has been happening for decades. The latest version of Doom is 2000x larger than the original. I was playing that version of Doom on my first HD which was 800 MB at the time. A HD which is 2000x the capacity is 1.6TB. In other words, HD capacity has grown accordingly, and will continue to.

Edit: same trend exists for windows. Windows 95 was 19MB and Windows 10 is ~40GB, about 2000x larger again."
