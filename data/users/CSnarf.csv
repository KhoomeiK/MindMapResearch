Honestly- as a fellow vet, who has many friends who work in the marine mammal world, I’m a bit surprised this is the first time you and your friend have clashed over this opinion.

rundisney,fee8vk8,t1_fee5wfu,1579028804.0,"It's interesting to me the way that people parce training in to different sets. To me- your Dopey training starts now. Even if you are at 1 mile a week, start the gentle climb now. Training like this is about habit building. Plot it out- with more time, you have time to do things like repeat training weeks. Gives you more time to become comfortable with the higher mileage. And hey- if you get injured, you have wiggle room."
rundisney,fee30u1,t1_fedq70k,1579025347.0,"It wasn't truly scientific :) I hacked out some of the parts of galloway and higdon that I didn't like (like the magic mile, or cross training days). yes yes, there is a lots of good reason to do those things- but I wasn't going to, so I focused on what I was going to do. I did more of Higdon's mile progression, but more the daily schedule of galloway. I put in the hiking/long walks that galloway added. 

Really- honestly- it doesn't matter that much. It's a simple formula. You need to put lots and lots of miles on your calendar. You need to build up slowly to them. It's good to stack some training days so your body is used to back to back days. I completely understand the impulse to obsess over the perfect training regimen. But honestly, that's more procrastination than actual preparation. It doesn't matter if you do galloway, or higdon, or your own schedule. As long as you get to a place where you can comfortably run/walk at least a 60 mile week, with one of those runs being at least 20 miles, you should be fine."

cosmeticsurgery,fe9rh13,t3_efnwxq,1578940871.0,"First, let's get this out of the way: your appearance has not changed significantly in any way. Like others have said- in the later pictures, you are wearing your hair differently and its slightly less flattering. But honestly- even that is not significant.

Here's the cold hard truth: It looks like your ex-girlfriend wanted to hurt you, and succeeded beyond her wildest dreams.   
My friend, when someone is caught doing something wrong, a common and unfortunate response is to lash back and try to make it the other persons fault. We don't want to admit we did something wrong, so we try to explain our bad behavior as a reaction to someone else. She did this to you by saying you became ugly. 

I will repeat that you are not ugly and your appearance did not change. But let's entertain the idea that you had become less attractive for a moment. In that scenerio- her behavior would still be wrong. A change in a persons appearance does not make it okay for a person to cheat. Long term relationships, over the course of years, have to weather changes in appearance. People get older, fatter, have accidents, bad haircuts, etc etc. None of those events makes cheating okay. If you no longer want to date a person, due to appearance or anything else, the appropriate adult behavior is to be honest about that, break up with them and then see new people. 

As a person, she is responsible for her own actions. You did not make her cheat. She cheated, and then said something really shitty when caught. Something aimed to make you feel as small as she felt. Don't give her that power over you."

That anatomy coloring book someone posted is a fine start.

However- this is a marathon, not a sprint. 

Good habits will take you further than cramming. You have picked a tremendously stressful profession. It is your responsibility to take care of yourself so you can deal with stress. This means doing a lot of boring adulting so your body and mind can handle it. 

Work on a budget. You want to leave school with as little debt as possible. 

Build good habits. Go to the gym. Work on healthy meal prep. Have a hobby. Don’t let your habits fall down just because school starts. Make a schedule- put that self care stuff in that schedule right along with classes and studying. 

Treat school like a job. Do the reading. Go to class. Have study partners.

You are going to be okay. Welcome :)"
