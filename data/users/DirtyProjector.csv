AmItheAsshole,feav46f,t3_el32ez,1578952466.0,"I came across this post from another site, and I have to be honest, the comments on here are insane.  

First of all, the OP clearly outlines that he made a mistake, and in follow up posts, states he apologized, and his wife freaked out and took his child and left.  

Second of all, since we only have the ops account to go off of, it seems the wife lied that this lasagna even existed in the first place, and has a history of lying that makes him feel insecure about interacting with her.  On top of that, she told him the lasagna was gone, so why would he even consider that it could be hers?  If she had just been honest, I see no indication he would have eaten it, and he likely would have thought of it when he went down to take it out of the freezer.

Peoples responses are outright vitriolic, suggesting this guy is a huge asshole because:

 1. He didn't cook his own meal
 2. He didn't follow an instruction for something that he felt wasn't a huge deal
 3. He followed an instruction by taking something out of the freezer because his wife instructed him not to buy something.
 4.  Somehow his response of apologizing, but also suggesting she was over reacting, makes him the biggest asshole who's ever lived.  Not only that, people are ACTIVELY endorsing his wife's history of lying, because he's such a huge asshole from this single event.

I don't know about the rest of the people in this thread, but there are many things I ask other people to do for me because I don't know how/am bad at/don't have the time to learn the skill for.  For example, I don't know how to sew, and I don't think anyone would call me an asshole for asking my mom/partner/a complete stranger to sew something for me and not learn the skill myself.  

I legitimately don't understand what's going on, or where the hate for this guy is coming from.  He made a mistake, said he apologized, and then provided context on here as to what happened, that clearly indicates this was a confluence of shitty situations that resulted in his wife having a meltdown due to grief.  We don't have enough info as to what happened in the following hours that caused her to leave.

ESH, including most of the people in this thread."
AmItheAsshole,feard5t,t1_fdfbdn1,1578951552.0,"I'm pretty sure he said in another post he did apologize.  Just because he didn't explicitly state it in this post, doesn't mean he didn't.  

Also, many people don't know how to cook, especially a lasagna.  If my wife was an artist, would it be unreasonable for me to ask her to draw something as a gift for someone, because I am a terrible artist?    

Telling someone to get a grip on their life because they made a simple mistake?  Gotta be honest, your response makes you seem like an asshole."
ADHD,feaetv8,t1_fea7ybx,1578947830.0,"I obviously do not know you, but what you describe doesn't sound like ADHD to me.  Maybe you have ADHD, I can't diagnose that, but all I have to do is go off your post, and like I said, what you are describing seems like a completely normal thought process and does not seem illustrative of ADHD.  

Just because you are struggling in life, doesn't mean you have ADHD.  Humans are very good at assigning categories and names to things, especially when it comes to physical and mental issues, because we use them to categorize and reference things, as well as diagnose and prescribe.  I was just trying to offer an alternative perspective to you, because you are seemingly struggling, and it's entirely possible that you could find help and support if you reframe the way you see things, especially in your self.  

For example, I was told when I was 13 that I had panic disorder, and that I would have to be on medication for the rest of my life.  I spent 10 years suffering, before I got proper treatment.  I am now panic, and medication free, all because I got a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.  

If you want to be defensive, and take my post as an affront to you, or trying to suggest that you aren't trying hard enough, I'm sorry that it came across that way.  I can't do much about that.  I was just trying to help and give you an alternative perspective."
ADHD,fe9ug2l,t1_fe6klc1,1578941547.0,"I have to be honest, that doesn't sound like ADHD to me.  That sounds more like some kind of obsessive disorder or spectrum disorder.  Like, I have ADHD, and it usually manifests as - I'm reading something, and my mind wanders and I start thinking about something else, or I'm reading something and I remember that I have to pay a bill, and I stop what I'm doing and pay that bill.  I don't see thinking through the steps of making a peanut butter sandwich, thinking about the ingredients you have, and the constituent steps to getting your end result, as being a manifestation of ADHD.  I think that aspects of what you describe can be attribute to a lack of focus, but everything you point out are thoughts that every human has.  Think about it - Do you think a normal persons brain doesn't think ""I want a sandwich, do I want it now or later?"".  Perhaps getting distracted along the way, is a component of ADHD, but I'm not sure that that's anything pathological.

I think that you clearly are an aware person, and aware of your thoughts.  But I think your post highlights the problem with the diagnosis of ""attention deficit"", in particular because it makes people feel like they are in some way deficient.  Now, I am not a researcher or a doctor, or a trained professional, but I have had enough experience/thought enough about this/had my own experience long enough to know that ADHD is a bogus diagnosis.  It is likely that people who exhibit ADHD symptoms have an underlying issue, such as a sensory issue, or their brain just works differently, or they have an untreated issue with trauma/depression/anxiety, but it gets labeled as ADHD which is just unhelpful.  

It might be helpful to you to practice meditation, and meta cognition.  Be more aware in the moment of your thought process and what is going on in your body.  I think it's totally normal to think ""Am I hungry?  What do I want?  Is it appropriate to have a sandwich now?""  If you then get up and get distracted doing something else, or start thinking about taking a yoga class, just try to exert self control, or be aware of what's going on in your body, and try to focus on the task at hand.  Each time you do that throughout the day, you are training your brain to be on task, or becoming aware of underlying processes that are contributing to your distraction.  

Again, it's entirely possible you are just more aware of your thought process/more in touch with unconscious processing than your partner.  I am unable to visualize at present, and I've talked to a number of people about their ability to visualize in their heads.  Most of the people who i talk to respond ""I've never really thought about whether or not I can visualize"".  These are HIGHLY INTELLIGENT people - how is it possible they haven't thought about, or are aware, of their ability to visualize things in their head or not?  

But I do not understand how anyone could accomplish what you are asking without going through those steps.  Think about if you were building a staircase.  Do you think a contractor doesn't think - What do I need for this job?  I need wood, and nails and tools.  Where are my tools?  Do I have a hammer?  Do I have nails?  Let me check for my nails.  I don't have nails.  Where should I get nails?  Should I check to see if there are deals online for nails?  To me, the traditional way we think fo ADHD would be:  What do I need to do this job?  I need nails, and a hammer, and wood.  Wood is cool, I wonder if there's any new kinds of wood out there.  *Opens phone* Oh look, I have a notification from X app, let me check that app.  Oh I wonder what Karen is doing, I'm going to message her"".   But again, that's not a deficit of attention, it's a self control/self regulation issue."

I first really learned of this concept in a book called Americanah - incredible novel - where Africans think very poorly of African Americans. It was then brought back into my awareness when I saw a black performer do a very jarring musical performance piece where he talked about how he has nowhere to return to. If he feels oppressed and marginalized in America, he can’t just “go back to his country” because he has no country or culture to return to. He knows nothing of Africa and no one in Africa would want him. It was extremely powerful and just underscored the plight of African Americans."

He literally has started an international incident because he wants to one up Obama and his only political achievements are undoing anything Obama did during his presidency. How no one is speaking out and stopping this lunatic on the right is mind boggling.
