Then like OP said simply remove the background in design space and you're good to go."

heartbreak,fcvxlli,t3_ej6h4w,1578012404.0,"I feel your hurt. I'm 6 months into this same thing but with my wife. She has our 6month old son too. I have all the love in the world to give, yet I think the fact she simply doesn't love me anymore is the toughest pill to swallow.
I think the only thing really getting me through it other than my son is that we cant force these people to love us. And we have to find peace in that. 
This pain wont last forever, I'm not going to pretend to have the answers but just know you're not alone and we here really care about you :)"

forza,fbfl9l4,t1_fbebp05,1576813360.0,"It's less about horsepower and more about dialing in grip. The 2 cars in this clip are 550hp but running a real soft rear suspension, damper, bump and roll bars + 28 and 25 psi in the front and rear tyres respectively."
