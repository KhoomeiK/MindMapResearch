AskReddit,fd2zfb9,t1_fd047rw,1578153316.0,"Damn this is so true!  Right now I'm actually at home (not employed) cause I'm facing some health issues. (Nothing major at the moment, but enough to prevent me from attending work everyday) I remember feeling really awful when I had to put in my resignation, yet they already had someone to replace me.... NO ONE should feel bad for putting their health/others health before a few days work for a company who would otherwise would do just fine either way...."
