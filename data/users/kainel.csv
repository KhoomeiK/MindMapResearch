LegendsOfRuneterra,ffbd52w,t3_esdgg6,1579760322.0,"The first way to tell if a card is ""good"" is its body. I.e. the total stats it has for its cost.

An innacurate but quick rule of thumb is its health and attack should be about its cost.

Example:
A one cost by default is about 1/1, a two cost is about 2/2, a three cost is about 3/3 etc.

When you see a cost like ancient croccolith at 7/7 for 4 cost, its quite a bit past curve. You will however note that it has expensive summoning costs to balance it out.

Likewise if something is below that curve, like say phantom prankster, you should expect it to have an above average effect or ability.

The first type of 'bad' card, is one which doesnt have enough raw stats to justify its cost, or whose effect is worth too little for the stats it gives up.

The second way to tell if a card is bad or good is to compare it to other cards in its weight class i.e. cards that, within a mana one way or the other, you could play instead.

As an example, Darius vs Hecarim. For basically the same cost, on paper Darius gets slightly better stats. However, factoring in Hecarims passive, hecarim actually gets almost double darius attack and thats before he levels up. So compared to hexarim, darius is a bad card even if his raw numbers are ""fine"".

The last way to tell if a card is good or not is to look at its potential in a combo.

For example, oblivious islander has the effect of making an ally ephemeral and reducing its cost by one. This could be terrible! Even cheaper, the ephemeral status is a heavy nerf and will kill your card in one turn.

However! Looking at his potential to combo with Anivia, as an example, and you see her passive makes ephemerals negative effect meaningless. She just ends up with a great 1 mana discount!

The hardest type of value to quantify is investment. Lets talk about Teemo. Teemo decks require a lot of investment. Mushroom cards are ONLY good in teemo decks, and teemo decks are only good with mushroom cards. As a result, teemo decks are very invested in teemo himself.

If the enemy can easily eliminate teemo, you are so heavily invested in teemo it is difficult to gave another win condition. You cant have a pocket tryndamere like you could in a deck based around anivia, or a ledros in a shadow isles deck."

""Corporate Welfare"" we'll define as government assistance to corporations that do not provide any residual or return benefit to the government or, more directly, canadian taxpayers.

To start with, how do you measure the benefit to the government or canadian taxpayer?

Take, for example, Bombardier.

There's immense value in having a Canadian company capable of the world class infrastructure projects that that company can produce. Not just economically, in the form of jobs and contracts. It's also important to have that kind of engineering capability in the event of changing world relations, trade sanctions, and war. Having a national company is much safer for major projects when you are worried about information age warfare. See the telecoms industry for a tiny but visible slice of what all industries are facing.

How much is too much? Do contracts count or only direct subsidies? Does it count if the money is spent directly on internships, training, canadian jobs?

As a counter example, look at the Orphan Wells.

There's immense cost associated with cleaning up abandoned oil wells. Not just economically, in the form of labor, environmental assessment, and removal of contaminants. It's also expensive environmentally, with costs to the health of local residents, local habitats, and working crews. Having wells cleaned up is necessary, as they become long term environmental risks.

How much is too much? Do you consider the insurance paid to local governments to negate responsibility for the total cost? Does it count if the legal entity that established the well is moved elsewhere? Does that cost count to the individual corporations or to the industry as a whole?

What about a company like Walmart.

There's social costs associated with underpaid workers. Not just economically, in the form of reduced taxes, increased burden on social programs, and higher healthcare costs. It's also expensive individually, with lower life expectancy, socioeconomic damage to child development, and access to shelter.

How much is too much? Do you consider the company getting a subsidy if they are offering legal minimum wages? Does it count if the business model is purposefully taking advantage of economic shortcomings? Does it count if no money has been set aside for that particular business in particular?"

The economic advantage of a low skilled low education immagrant in Pool B is that they are not competing against young canadian talent in Pool A (most young Canadians are moderately to highly educated) as well as the usual benefits of the poor: they have to spend their money to survive.

This means that costs remain low for labour jobs, opportunities remain open for skilled Canadians, and money remains in the economy rather than adding wealth for a foreign born citizens bank account, which may end up leaving the economy.

Edit:
In addition, that low income low education worker thats added to our economy will also have children, which god willing with our social and education investments will become another high skilled, high education canadian.

A super canadian, one that can do things like access foreign markets, navigate foreign cultures, create demand for canadians in other countries, create cultural ties to other countries.

All things that not only provide immense economic value, but global stability. Its hard to go to war with countries that are closly linked economically and socially. These super canadians are also our ambassadors, spreading our ideas and values to their sisters, friends, and communities.

If you want to export major cultural shifts, against things like genital mutilation, gender discrimination, working conditions or for things like agricultural reform, vaccination, resource management you can do it qith a face and a voice thats familiar.

Its why international education is so important as well, both our students leaving and their students coming here."

If I could do it all again Id only work for clusterfuck Mom.and Pop shops. That apprentiship dealnlooks amazing.

Not only are you going to get professional training through the  mandatory school work, you are going to see how the entire business is run because small shops like that havent streamlined everything to gears and buttons.

If you ever want to open your own shop, and BOY is that an acheivable dream today compared to 30 years ago, its going to be so much more valuable.

You're going to see all their fuckups that they cant because it's been run like that since the beginning. You will see what machines run all day and what machines are coat racks. You will see how often the shop needs to be cleaned and how often it actually gets cleaned. You will see the owners fight negotiations with clients over the phone. If you are REALLY lucky, youll be able to get to work on jobs you have no business being. Maybe get experience on the phones, meet some suppliers, make some web ads.

That being said, there are standard cooktimes across meals. A stew will always be about 35 minutes. Chicken breast will always be 12. A big roast will always be about 90.

After that, look for roasts, chicken breasts, pork chops.

All of them can be thrown in with basically salt and potatoes for a good meal if you use chicken broth instead of water.
