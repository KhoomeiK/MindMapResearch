darknetdiaries,ffk4psz,t3_es81mr,1580015785.0,"It wouldn't surprise me if some of it was scripted. In fact, it'd be the opposite. Some of these guest are at the top of cyber and need MOD authentication. But overall, it's quite tame in terms of propoganda. 

I think the majority of the big national state employees do want what's best for us. It's the top of the food chain that wants what's best for them. And we don't know who the top is never mind hear from them."

Android,ffh0njm,t1_ffgk3z9,1579919946.0,Ohhh yeh agree in that. I listened to a podcast called Shannon from DarkNet Diary's. It's about Aramco oil and in 2012 I think they had a massive attack. They had to employ lots of cyber techs and they all just named a price. The gov wouldn't be able to do that.

AnimalsBeingBros,ffdzldh,t1_ffdprq3,1579832884.0,"If you have farm land a collie is probably the best and easiest dog to care for. I spent most of my childhood around a farm and the lanes, it was a friend's farm and he had a collie called Kane (Named after the wrestler) 

He would accompany us on all our expeditions, from Quad biking to just chilling with a joint in front of the fire. He'd just get up in the middle of the night and not come back for days on end. Sometimes just sleeping in the hay barns.

Sometimes after a few days we'd jump in the truck and go look for him as we'd get worried but usually he'd have been spotted in the other end of town as they owned a trucking company who called in they'd spotted him.

Anyway, he lived till 15 and unfortunately got ran over on the motorway. Like the Collie they had before him. And the one before that. In fact, the other collie I knew also got ran over."

reddevils,ffdrxre,t1_ffdfigz,1579827437.0,Not disagreeing mate just proper pisses me off that we've had our club ripped apart since fergie. I feel like we've lost what we once we're but lucky enough to have seen most games since 99. We gained our notoriety by being the best. Hoping we have a bit of a revolution in the coming months.

reddevils,ffa3vb1,t1_ff9s4m8,1579727360.0,"Exactly. That's why I'm worried about us not getting Bruno. Do they want to cheap out and get somebody around 50m? If so, why? Who else do they plan on buying."

instant_regret,ff71mjb,t1_ff6yi6c,1579639329.0,"I can believe it as I know they are expensive if things go wrong. That's why it's best to rent it over 3 years mostly. I've owned a 63 plate 1series F20 for 6 years and not had any issues touch wood. Major services is a good £500 but apart from that it's not really cost me any more than my ford Fiesta did. In terms of cost per year and trade in its probably around the same. 

I am getting rid asap now though as like you say if anything went wrong it'd cost a fair chunk. Good to know."
