Do You Have Anxiety?

If  you identify with several symptoms and signs of anxiety, you may be  having an anxiety disorder. Answer the following questions to find out:

* Are you worried about being anxious on a daily basis?
* Do you have fears that others may find you irrational?
* Do you find yourself in the mid of heart-pounding panic attacks every now and then?
* Do you avoid socializing because it causes you more anxiety?
* Are you having concentration issues and blank mind?
* Are the anxious feelings interfering in your college, social and personal life?

If  you have answered ‘yes’ to any of the above questions, you may have to  consult the primary health care provider or the student health center  for assistance.

Natural Remedies To Cure Anxiety:

If  symptoms of anxiety are hindering you from performing to your potential  or interfering with your daily routine, then you should try these cheap  remedies at home to feel better:

* **Drink three cups of Chamomile tea:** It is the source of two chemicals (apigenin and luteolin) that can relax your brain nerves.
* **Breathe in lavender:**  The scent of lavender is used to alleviate symptoms of anxiety. So you  can have a lavender-massage or put few drops in your bathtub.
* **Add amino acid in diet:**  Amino acid can be found in beans, fish and meat or you can buy oral  supplement as well. It can potentiality reduce the anxiety level of  stress hormones.
* **Light therapy:**  Stay under the sun for at least 15 minutes a day because it is the best  way to increase your vitamins D levels in the body. A Japanese study  has found that whoever walks 20 minutes though the forest can reduce  anxiety level than those who take a stroll in an urban area.
* **Exercise:**  Yes, again, because this is the best way to supply your brain some  feel-good hormones endorphins. Research suggests that increased body  heat — a natural result of exercising — can alter your neural circuit  that is responsible for cognitive function and mood.
* **Keep something to eat:**  Students get more anxious when they are hungry. In more scientific  tone, you may get an anxiety attack when your blood sugar level is  dropping. So always keep a handful of walnuts or a piece of dark  chocolate, and biscuits with you.
* **Have breakfast:**  Many people, who skip breakfast, show the symptoms of anxiety. So  skipping breakfast is a strict no-no for you. Have eggs in breakfast  because it contains the natural source of choline. Low levels of choline  are proportionate to high level of anxiety.
* **Face the fear:** This is not only for saying! You must employ this in practical. Scared of clowns? Go to a circus."

TrueReddit,fepkazn,t3_eq4253,1579322718.0,"I remember being depressed. It was a frightening state of mind that seemed to go on indefinitely. The very idea of waking up was riddled with dread. A state of internal turbulence, apprehension and negativity about the future propelled the total collapse of a positive and optimistic attitude. I felt like my mind suddenly became sick and twisted. I didn’t recognize my new self, and wondered what had happened to the cheerful person I used to be.

The reason for my depression was my father's death. But what led to depression was not so much the reaction to our split, but the realization that the one you believed loved you, who was closest to you and promised to be with you forever, had left you for forever, a stranger indifferent to your pain. The past became so precious, and the future ceased to exist. The world itself wasn’t credible any more.

In that state of depression, I found the attitude of others changed dramatically. Depression is not particularly tolerated in society, and I realized that those around me were of two persuasions. One group of people wanted to fix me, telling me to pull myself together or recommending professional help. The other group tended to shun me like a leper. In hindsight, I understand this reaction: after all, I had become cynical, agnostic and pessimistic, and I hadn’t bothered to be polite.

On the other hand, I developed a deeper understanding of the genuine suffering of others. In my depression, I learned about the dark side of the world, about which I knew little before. I could no longer ignore suffering and delusion, opening a new window on reality that was unpleasant indeed. My experience is not unique, but it was in some sense heightened because, in addition to being a regular human encountering a pathetic breakup, I’m also a philosopher. As a philosopher, I know that what seems to be obvious is far from always so, and therefore requires rigorous critical analysis. So, in the wake of my experience, I was especially inclined to doubt the equation of positive moods with health, and of negative moods with distortion. Could it be that, in my depression, I was finally seeing the world as it was?"

It ruins weekend parties, movie plans, guitar classes, sports  and many more. One needs skills to navigate homework in the manner that  will foster independence, knowledge, and good study habits. Studying  hard always does not mean that staying awake late night compromising on  relaxation. It is important to participate in other activities in  addition to education. Academic professionals always fail to address  this issue. Teaching has been overemphasised since ages and mental well  being has always has been neglected. Social and emotional development  has always been ignored which if taken care of will yield better  results.  However, at university life, homework is much easy with [homework help](https://myassignmenthelp.com/homework/) available online.

If you are overburdened with the homework and unable to maintain  the balance between academics and fun, you may find this blog useful.  Here are some tips to make your life more organized and balance homework  and fun. As per the experts, the below given strategies are useful for students

&#x200B;

* Analyse- analyse the time required to accomplish the work and  set the deadline accordingly. You must be loyal and honest with the set  routine. Think and work with the daily activities. Analysing will give a  clear idea. Routine must be prepared in manner that incorporates  everything from studies, to bathing, eating, sports and fun.
* Strong  determination- Once the routine is set, you must be determined to  accomplish every task mentioned on it as per the deadline. No matter  what natural calamity comes never compromise on the timetable.  Practicing this activity will make life more organised. Go for your  favourite hobby, movie or play only when you have completed your  homework
* Effective scheduling- It is necessary to evaluate what  can fit in the schedule and what cannot. It is better to omit some of  the activities that were part of the school. With age we need to engage  in activities that will add more value to life. Some of the activities  need to be replaced such as arts, dance and others. At the university  level one may not have sufficient time in regular art work. Therefore,  fun can be added to life through simple activities. It may be a peaceful  walk in park at sunrise or hitting gym for 30 minutes. It can be  watching movie or a long conversation with friends. Engaging in too many  outdoor activities will only rip of the physical energy and will leave  us mentally exhausted. It is difficult to concentrate effectively on any  work with poor physical and mental well being"

Sometimes the students are told to study a single subject whole day so that they can develop strong command and mastery over it. However, learning the same subject throughout all day can be monotonous and boring. Sometimes when you study similar information, your mind cannot stimulate it any longer and hence you can get confused and mix-up different ideas. So, it is always better to study multiple subjects every day. But it does not signify that you should learn all the subjects in one day; try to provide equal time to at least two subjects in a day. Studying multiple subjects in a single day is always helpful when you are preparing for the upcoming examinations.

**Key Tip:** You can be weak in one particular subject which you don’t like to study and always avoid. But dividing your time equally for all the subjects can help you to excel in it."
