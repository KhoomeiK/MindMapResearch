I've been repeatedly pigeonholed into copy writing and proofreading, just because I speak several languages, and also because I have an eye for visually appealing text layout.

The truth is that I've always HATED paperwork. Hated school because of it; hated most of my jobs because it; hated most NGO work because of it.

I consider my situation a consequence of the Peter Principle: The higher ups found ONE thing I'm super good at, and they cannot seem to picture me doing anything else.

What I'd rather do with those language skills? I'd rather BE that higher up who can communicate with outsiders in several languages."

The experiment was canned ahead of time for ideological reasons, because the political parties in power don't like the idea of no-strings attached benefits, even though the advantages we clearly demonstrated."

However, my mom is a textbook example of the helicopter parent. She also likes to play victim whenever people don't live according to her wishes. To top it all, she is pretty dismissive of other people's hardship. She responds to their random sighs with New Age bullshit about life taking people to where they're meant to be, not where they want to be, or by faking phone network failures (*""Sorry, I cannot hear what you're saying. There's too much noise in the phone.*"") whenever something really important that she'd rather not hear has to be told.

In my late-20's, I relocated to the other side of the planet and one of the key reasons (on top of better career prospects) was to ensure that I would be so far out of my mom's reach that she would be forced to stop her helicopter parenting. She indeed stopped. However, she kept on playing her victim card for many years, randomly sending me and my brother e-mails about how it's *so* cruel and unfair that both of her boys have essentially cut all ties with her. Reminding her of how this came to be falls onto deaf ears. Yeah, fuck that."

This stench refusal to accept defeat, combined with USA's growing reliance on interconnected SIGINT, essentially guarantees that USA will lose the minute someone manages to disrupt the SIGINT link of those spanking new F-35, mess with the global GPS system, or simply rely on low-tech means of inflicting heavy casualties to USA.
