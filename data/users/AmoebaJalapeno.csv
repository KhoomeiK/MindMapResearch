Advice,ff3l67r,t3_erc563,1579543390.0,"I didn't actually intend to do it this way but I found out later, sometimes you gotta find a business that is desperate for more workers. The job I've been at for a year was desperate for night shift workers and now I'm a shift lead. Good luck!"

AskReddit,fdhpjc0,t3_elbejj,1578427601.0,"Always been irritated by ""let the Lord's Will Be Done"". No shit buddy he can do it if he wants it to be it'll happen. Maybe he wants people to actually put effort into things getting better instead of just laying down to die waiting for God to do something. 

Also never been a fan of when someone asks how I'm doing and me, being someone who typically has difficulty sleeping says I'm tired. I get hit with ""how is someone so young so tired"" like gee ya dumb fuck maybe cuz i work 12 plus hours 5 days a week and even when I'm home I'm too anxious to sleep."
offmychest,fddqdf5,t3_eku4f1,1578321172.0,"I don't know you or your husband but first impressions are telling me he's going to have a hard time taking things seriously. The fact that he's mocking the therapist based on something as trivial as a name makes it seem like for whatever reason he's projecting some unhappy onto the therapist. Like maybe deep down he knows things aren't going well in the marriage but is unwilling or unable to confront his part in it? 

My dad resorts so mocking when I try to tell him that a certain way he acts is painful for me, and I think there's a similar pattern in your situation. Good luck mending your relationship. I wish y'all the best."

Advice,fcohdnl,t3_ei30bu,1577832267.0,"Under normal circumstances, I would advise to go for it. But it will just make things awkward for. Tense for the boyfriend and maybe painful for you. If you can't see her as anything other than a lover, then I know it sucks but it may be time to part ways."
Advice,fclrspv,t3_ehsyae,1577754905.0,"Guy here. Multiple lines have been crossed. You can't consent while you're not concious. You can't consent while on a drug, medicine or otherwise. Not only that, he attempted to videotape it. Who knows for what purpose that could have been for. That is rape. It's sickening. Run."
AskReddit,fclqr06,t3_ehquh9,1577754180.0,I would love to have this happen but it would be difficult to enforce and implications of such a loss of freedom is a hard obstacle to get around

offmychest,fcaxckj,t1_fcau2eb,1577578479.0,"I feel it is too soon at this point since we only recently reconnected after being separated 2 years ago. Plus she has to go back to another state soon and I don't have good experience with long distance relationships. 

But I definitely intend to shoot my shot this time."
offmychest,fby9ph9,t3_ef0dva,1577211505.0,"Honestly I think you should celebrate this Christmas somewhere else. If I were in your shoes, I would feel not welcome and I don't really feel obligated to engage in any family gatherings whatsoever. If holidays are stressful, no point in participating imo"
