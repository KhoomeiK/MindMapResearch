AtlantaUnited,ff6nkxp,t1_ff6cvl0,1579631015.0,"Once the initial shock died down and I saw what we got and what he was asking for salary-wise, I feel the same way. It sucks that a player that was a part of this club from the very beginning is going to a club that we’ve lost others to in the past, but he’s getting paid. Like,*paid* paid. I personally don’t see a player worth $700K/year for 4 years when I watch Julian play. But, I’m a fan, not a professional who works for an MLS team. I just hope it works out for both Julian and DC, so that the salary doesn’t end up being a burden the club has to carry for a player that wasn’t actually worth it. For now, it remains to be seen, but I don’t hate this trade."
