RedLetterMedia,ff36lpz,t1_feysf2d,1579534918.0,Those backgrounds were handmade with airbrushes and they probably didn't want to do an excessive amount of them with the production of the movie already being incredibly strained.
RedLetterMedia,ff36gl2,t1_ff0myi7,1579534822.0,"Most people outside of Ireland and places adjacent to Ireland don't have a clue with any of those names. You can't just read those names, you have to know that exact name and what weird conventions it follows, like there's no logic, how does ""Domhnall"" turnd to ""Donald""? What happened to the mh?"

HistoryPorn,ff35hmx,t1_ff2mcq7,1579534151.0,"Well, sorta, but technically the House of Bernadotte is actually older than the House of Glücksburg. Denmark had to change houses because King Frederik VII turned out to be sterile and didn't have any immediate brothers or uncles, thus ending the reign of the House of Oldenburg.

But yes, The House of Glücksburg similarly descends from the first historic King of Denmark, Gorm. General Bernadotte was only adopted as an adult by the old and childless Swedish king to avoid a similar situation as to what Denmark would face later in the same century."

RedLetterMedia,ff0c1nq,t1_ff0bd2l,1579467475.0,"The glasses theatres use are different than the ones used by 3D TVs back when those were a thing.

Theatres used polarized light, which is something you can only do with a projector, but the glasses are really simple and cheaply mass-produced. For 3D on a TV you would most usually see active shutter glasses, where the glasses have a battery and are sychronized to the TV to dark each eye on alternating frames."
RedLetterMedia,fezqw85,t1_fezlzo9,1579460514.0,"From what I remember it was a lot of gimmick shots, which is always the trap with 3D, because it means you end up with Jaws 3D, ie ""Oh here is the 3d shot"". Ideally you want it to enhance the depth of the movie and the scenes, and not just use it throw stuff at the audience like Captain Eo"

RedLetterMedia,feylwtu,t1_fey9gt7,1579447362.0,"There were two movies where I thought it being in 3D added to it, this movie and Avatar, everything else it was just an annoyance that made the image darker for no reason.

3D would've been a neat thing to have for certain big blockbusters that wanted to do something interesting with it, instead they slapped it on every single movie to upcharge the movie going audiences for it and thus killed the golden goose."
RedLetterMedia,feyloxb,t1_feyhu7a,1579447272.0,"I guess that's true, but even Disney wouldn't do a whole movie on ""ones"", with one animation cel per frame of film, usually they'd only do that for certain scenes, otherwise things would be on ""twos"" where you have each frame of animation repeated twice, or using some trickery like moving the background on alternating frames from the cels. That's probably why they had to outsource Korean labor for part of the process, there's a funny story on the documentary that Jay mentions where they forgot to dry the enlargements on the first run they made so someone at Disney had to hastily call them and tell them to let the giant film panes dry first before packing them together for shipping back to California."

RedLetterMedia,fey6ukn,t3_eqw2u8,1579441507.0,"Agreed on all points that the original Tron has a boring story and is weirdly drawn out, but it's a movie that is interesting from a production standpoint.

Like they didn't have modern keying technology and they couldn't use bluescreen, so for every single frame of the movie that was set in the computer, they had to print enlargements of the film, several of them, and then paint out things, layer them, then print them back together again. It's such an absurd idea, and I have no idea why Disney ever agreed to do it, and it's worth watching for that.

It's a crying shame they never made a 3rd movie but Disney decided that after Tron Legacy didn't break the bank and Lone Ranger and John Carter were big flops to just cancel all live action movies aside from Marvel and Pirates of the Caribbean which is so fucking dreadful. Oh well, maybe they'll come back to it some day, and follow up on that Cillian Murphy cameo as Dillinger's son."

It goes both ways, that's why having a dash camera is a smart idea. Even if you never, ever in the entire life of that dash cam have to pull footage from it to show to a police officer, you have that safety for that one time some stupid asshole tries to commit insurance fraud on you."
