india,fde4hz0,t1_fde2xr4,1578330991.0,"I highly doubt we'll ever get a leader like that well, atleast not in our lifetime. The problem with our country is still the mixing up of politics with religion, caste etc. So, corruption, chaos will always prevail in our country."

india,fbrcte8,t1_fbr24cv,1577041686.0,Yep! The state of Tripura and Assam have both been facing an overflow of illegal immigrants for the past years and the indigenous people of Tripura have now become minorities in their own state while it is highly feared that Assam will soon face the same fate.
