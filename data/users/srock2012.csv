Make fitness a routine (even if that's just walking a few miles and making one meal a day healthier by design).  Lessen caffeine intake if you're a heavy user.  You don't have to cut it out, but lowering the amount can be the difference between awake and jittery.  Be aware of your surroundings without getting lost in the details.  You'll notice the people who want to interact without getting brushed off by the ones who don't.  Weed makes serious thinking more stressful, if you need your faculties to that kind of degree wait till you don't to take the edge off.

For me it's been all in the little things.  Keep note of what helps and add it to the routine.  It's not particularly exciting or groundbreaking, but it works.  I was benzo free all of 2019 besides plane trips.  That was pretty huge.
