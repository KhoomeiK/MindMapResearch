AskReddit,fezt9bi,t1_fey5sqj,1579461361.0,"Well you could buy a bunch of goat/cow/sheep/whatever semen before “doomsday” and store it for artificial insemination, eliminating the need for a bull, but you’d still have to deal with the calf - I suppose you could kill and eat it immediately or if it’s a female, raise it for milk and if it’s a male, raise it for more meat, but that’s still two whole cows (or goats etc) and then more calves on the way.  Even if you slaughter the calf immediately and use artificial insemination, you still have a cow to support, probably fully on pasture in an apocalyptic situation, and those types of animals need to eat a LOT.  

Plus, you have to figure out how to store the semen without electricity and running water and stuff, and you have to know how to inseminate the cow yourself without veterinarian help - and on that note, if anything goes wrong with your cow or the pregnancies, that cow is dead - I can’t imagine there are going to be many veterinarians around during the apocalypse, and even if there are, they would charge extremely high “prices” (more like traditional trade and bartering), maybe even demanding the whole cow as payment or something of the like which is important to your survival.  


Anyways, I spent too much time on this dumb response lol"

Anxiety,fet0jrb,t1_feshpmw,1579370721.0,"Yeah, this is how I feel about things like this too - it’s not exactly simple and easy to even get help.  Like, “you can choose to change it?”  That’s sorta how I’m interpreting that, and it’s really not true/doable all the time.  It’s not a simple choice to help yourself, it’s very complex actually.  It has been so terribly difficult for me to get help because of my illnesses - my anxiety disorders and issues constantly tell me that I’m being over dramatic about my problems and the therapists are going to laugh at me or tell everyone my secrets or yell at me or get mad because I’m not bad enough to be there or I’m insane, plus my depression and self-hate tell me that I’m not worth the help and it’s not going to help and nothing will ever help and it’s hopeless and I should just go kill myself because this is life and this is how it’s always going to be, and PTSD tells me that they’re going to throw me in a hospital and scream at me and treat me like a rabid animal and lock me up with violent and sexually inappropriate people who are legitimately out of control with completely different and very serious issues that aren’t being properly addressed if I tell anyone anything about me.  

You can’t just try to push past your issues to fix them because that’s what mostly everyone here has been doing and it’s not really working, clearly.  Exposure therapy may work for some people and some disorders, mostly phobias like spiders and heights and whatnot in my experience, but the mentality that exposure and even regular cbt or other therapies are cure-alls is extremely harmful to people who can’t get help or haven’t seen any results from these practices, and it’s super hurtful when people around me constantly say stuff like this to me.  Plus, the process of working up the courage to actually get help and then follow through with everything is super difficult for someone with mental illnesses, and it really isn’t a choice that some people can make.  Not saying that this is really what the commenter meant to say, but this is how it could be interpreted and I wanted to address this issue.

Sorry if this wasn’t what was meant or is irrelevant or something :/"

aww,fcs4fe1,t1_fcs25r5,1577911319.0,"Yeah, plus there are emotional support animals that are legally allowed on planes.  Honestly, I think animals really shouldn’t ride in cargo and some should be allowed in the cabin, but only a very limited number of animals per flight and they should obviously be very well behaved.  Otherwise, don’t take your animal on the trip."

Maybe.  I’m not a bird naming expert lol"

therapy,fc0q4ck,t3_efgtfx,1577296934.0,"I’ve had similar experiences and it’s definitely hard, and it made me super scared of therapy and seeking help at all.  I haven’t been able to open up to any therapist and haven’t gone in a long time, but I think I might try to start again soon bc I really need help.  At the time, I was depressed, self-harming, and suicidal, all stemming from my severe anxiety disorders, and I was told basically that I should just get over it and stop being dramatic and that i was just lazy and that’s why I couldn’t go to school or leave the house, not that I was panicking literally the whole day at school and had no way to stop it and was agoraphobic and socially anxious.  The therapist wouldn’t let me talk at all and treated me as if I was a toddler, and wouldn’t let me explain any of my emotions or experiences.  Then I went to a psych hospital bc I was really not ok, and welp...its just plain abusive in there.  (Yay, now I’ve got PTSD!)  Anyways, she basically messed up a whole lot of my life, and it really sucks.  And my parents weren’t much better, constantly saying shit like “well [so and so] has anxiety and she can do this, why can’t you” and “you know everyone’s nervous sometimes, you’re not special” and I get that they may have been well meaning but shit like that really hurts, especially when you’re already vulnerable and often overthink everything.  

But i understand that that’s not what most therapists are like and that’s not what most therapists do, and I know that she was really wrong to act like that.  And your therapist was really wrong to treat you that way.  And it’s ok to feel the way you do about her, but you should definitely know that she shouldn’t say stuff like that.  Like, sure, I guess there’s one person somewhere who has a worse life than anyone else in existence, but that doesn’t mean that your feelings don’t matter/aren’t bad/aren’t valid and that you shouldn’t get treatment.  Sucks, man.  But she’s wrong.  You matter and you are valid."
