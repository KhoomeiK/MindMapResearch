technology,ffa9vb7,t1_ffa6zx5,1579730717.0,">The problem is, paying off that debt is going to put a huge chunk of taxpayer money into the black hole that is loan interest

This seems backwards. Not paying off debt or accumulation of debt means more interest payments compared to paying off debt. Public debt is just delayed taxation. 

> hitting the rich only works in a world where the rich can't uproot and leave 

First, the delayed taxation will hit the rich, there's simply no way around the fact that the rich will always be paying more in taxes than poorer people in a democratic capitalistic society. 

Second, rich people, time and again, show that they prefer not to leave and will accept the cist of taxes to stay where they prefer to be. Rich people generally don't leave due to taxes and no amount of tax breaks will get them to stay if they want to move. 

Again I want to highlight that a plan to borrow money to reduce the dead weight losses imposed on society from an underregulated natural monopoly is fiscally beneficial, whereas borrowing money for tax cuts during a prolonged economic expansion is not. Under both circumstances, the rich will be paying more in taxes."

So let me rephrase to Trump instead reduced revenues to increase borrowing **by amounts comparable to** Obama in a massive recession. Still a horrible move especially since so little was for infrastructure. 

I think you're stretching when you say that the green new deal fund not existing precludes borrowing to fund his proposal. My assumption of borrowing 100% of funds is the most conservative (i.e. worst case) assumption when it come to tax implications of his proposal and it still looks like an improvement over the current administration."

technology,ff9o014,t1_ff9firf,1579716989.0,Trump borrowed money for the tax cuts. He didn't find a way to fund his spending. He instead reduced revenues and increased borrowing more than Obama in a massive recession. Where is Trump's spending going to come from? Borrowing money to accomplish something that will permanently reduce cost for all residents of the nation is fiscally responsible. Bernie plan to borrow here seems fiscally sound. Trump did the opposite.
