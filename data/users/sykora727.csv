The sidewalks don’t exist or need repair, the streets are in disrepair, street signs need replaced and are worn out, curbs are faded out, and things are generally dirty or unsafe in many parts in LA County. There are fewer safe, clean neighborhoods than in many other major cities, and the housing problems in general requires creative approaches that the city managers can’t seem to develop.
