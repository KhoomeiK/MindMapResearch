That behavior was disgusting on my part, I will admit. But I have had to deal with spiritual/religious people tell me or someone I care about what's going to happen to them and this and that.

You really expected me to care to entertain that? Demonstrate to me, right now, that what you said is true and I promise you I'll apologize and admit I'm wrong.
If I claimed something isn't real, I apologize, but what I mean to say is, these claims are unfalsifiable, meaning no one can prove them wrong. But I want you to prove to me, demonstrate it, show me evidence that cannot be argued at all, and I'll change my ways.

You are hardwired to live, to live at all costs. To override that instinct takes an insane amount of bravery. ""It's the easy way out"" is just another trite buzz phrase. Anyway, do people really think we care if it's easy? You think once I die, I'll even know what the word ""coward"" means? 

It may get better, but some people don't want to hinge their bets on what ifs. Also, stop with the positive predictions and getting upset at people who argue against them. I'm tired of this trend of ""It's the positive thing to say, so it's true! I know what the future holds because of my own subjective experience!"""

You seem to not understand that money would literally boost my chances of following my passion and making it far easier to do so. I also listed how money could help me help myself, which would mean I'd be putting in the effort to improve my state of being. So I'd basically be doing it myself. Yet you seemed to have glossed over that. 
I already tried changing my perspective, multiple different times, yet you assume I haven't. Worked for a while, then it stopped. 

What kills me about people who want to point to those in worse situation than ours, who find happiness, don't care about noting those in similar situations who absolutely loathe it. They are ignored, for the most part. Also, those who point to people in worse situations as a means to put matters into perspective, also bring the notion that suffering is some kind of hierarchy. 

You can say ""Just wait, just wait, just wait"". Yet, I know people who have been waiting--and this is not hyperbole--their entire lives. You don't understand me, I don't understand you. We only recognize our feelings on a surface level. It's something I wanted my mother to realize. This disease and human nature are complex. We may relate to surface level shit, which gives the illusion that we understand each other. Though, the very fact that we disagree like this shows we don't. 

I don't value life like you do, not nearly as much so, and don't care to. I imagine, if life was a person, I'd choke them and smile about it. This thought makes me feel good. I do not deserve to live. 

You wouldn't think of doing that. I must value life because other people told me to. I didn't get a choice in this shit, no one asked for my consent, then I have to be born on a planet being told what I have to do. That being generally, not exactly you. 

Death makes me feel so much better than life does. Thinking about it makes me happy. Thinking about life doesn't. You do the math."

Money would help pay for medical bills because some people in this house have to keep going to the doctors, money would help me fucking travel to gain the inspiration I need to enliven my writing

Money would help me buy better exercise clothes and equipment so I can improve my health and body. Money would help me buy books and books. So no, I know I didn't word myself properly, but I don't think money will literally buy me happiness, but it would make everything a whole lot fucking easier.
