If you know in advance that playing a game a lot will eventually make it less fun then why begin to invest time in it at all?

I am better than a lot of my friends at this game. They don't wanna play with me sometimes because they don't want to be in hard lobbies. This isn't fun. Its fucking stupid. 

Whatever benefits of hidden-SBMM exist exist in ranked mode. How idiotic is it to have two game modes: ranked and secretly ranked."
apexlegends,fdtia9t,t1_fds4bfs,1578717150.0,"If playing relaxed games with your unskilled friends is no longer an option then people are gonna get sick of the game. There is a mode for playing against similarly skilled players: ranked. There is no point in having two game modes if they secretly are the same thing. Not having options is inferior to having options.

Just because you can play ultra carefully doesn't mean you wanna play like that all the time. Pros, streamers, and good people sometimes just wanna relax and have dumb fun too. That is not possible in the current game iteration because they will be put in games exclusively where the opponents are all playing very seriously. 

I was one of those absolute garbage players. I put 800 hours into the game to become better. But my reward for improving is, in fact, a punishment. I have less fun, do less damage, and win less games than when I started because I am paired up against literal professionals. With this arrangement, there is no point in me continuing to put time into this game. My experience will only inevitably continue to get worse."
