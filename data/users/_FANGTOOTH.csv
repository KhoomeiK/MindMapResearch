Nightshift,fbtmdna,t3_eeefv6,1577084682.0,I occasionally do night shifts and the oversleeping seems to me is related to your mental health. And I say this because when I do night shift for weeks I end getting pretty depressed and end up staying in bed all day long. Take care of yourself. Night shift does lead to mental health problems in some. I hope you find peace and the ability to rest.
