dogs,fffhqrn,t1_fff51en,1579884225.0,"I'm so glad that had a happy ending! 

Molly pulled something similar the day after thanksgiving. We went on a walk, and five minutes in she started limping. I was panicked, dragged her back home, cleaned and looked all over her paws.... Two seconds later she's bouncing off the walls with a toy in her mouth. 

She just didn't want to walk in the rain....."
dogs,fffh4ay,t3_etaw2f,1579883835.0,"Pretty sure today is the day my brother is getting a puppy. The shelter just called and said they are getting 3 GSD mixes in this afternoon. 

I don't know why I'm so anxious? I don't live with him or my parents, though I do see them often and they babysit Molly for me 3 days a week while I'm at work. 

I think Molly will be fine. She can be leash reactive, but has been nothing but great with other dogs off leash. 

I guess I just worry he and my parents have no idea what they're in for, and that something will happen between Molly and the puppy when I'm not around to supervise them together. 

I've never had a puppy, I don't have the time. Which is why I adopted an adult dog. My brother has also never had a puppy, so I don't think he quite understand what he's getting into. 

Someone please tell me I'm over reacting"
dogs,fffezwv,t3_etbs3d,1579882521.0,"That’s really weird. At the SPCA in my city, dogs under 6 months are $450, dogs over 6 months are $395. No matter the breed. I’ve never seen a rescue charge more for a particular breed. Unless the dog has been at the shelter a few weeks, so they lower the price.

dogs,ffcdtvc,t3_estlgm,1579797315.0,"My brother is dying for a puppy. He almost got one yesterday. 

I just don’t think he realizes just how much work it’s going to be. I keep trying to tell him that it’s like having a baby, he’ll be up all night taking the puppy out to pee. Puppies have boundless energy and chew on everything etc. 

It’s in one ear and out the other. He lives with my parents, and I don’t doubt that when he gets bored or overwhelmed that they’ll step in.

I think probably what’s going on here is that Jennifer spoils her kids because her parents weren’t able to do that for her, and as a kid she always wanted more. Whereas, because Jackie’s parents were wealthy, she knows that the “stuff” doesn’t matter and she’s trying to set her kids up not to be entitled and lazy, like her parents did with her. It’s old money vs new money.

In the summer after high school, I made out with some guy at a party. I didn’t know him, we were drunk and I just grabbed his face. This girl who was a friend of a friend started talking major shit about me. I guess he had just broken up with her best friend (who I didn’t know). And I remember being so turned off by the whole thing. I didn’t know him at all, we made out one time. But every time I saw him at a party afterward I avoided him like the plague because I didn’t want to be involved. 

Funnily enough, different party, I had a flirtation with a guy that amounted to us fooling around. Little did I know, he had made out with the girl who hated me on the same night! So I never spoke to him again. (I sound super slutty here. I had a make out bandit phase in my late teens post high school that lasted all of 4 months)

Anything above -10, I usually take her out when she decides to wake up (usually around 9-10am). We go for 20-30 minutes. We head out again around 1 for 30, then again at 4 for 30. The sun starts to set after that and it gets too cold to walk. 

Spring/summer/fall we do the same schedule, but it’s more diligent (every day without fail). And I usually add a last after supper walk. We also go on longer walks, especially on the weekends.

I want to share a bit of my thought process, maybe it'll help: 

I've been wrestling with the idea of having kids for about 5 years now. Do I really want kids? Or do I just think I want them because I've been told that my entire life? I think it's an incredibly personal decision, and one that you don't have to make right away. 

I personally, have been single for 10 years, and am about to turn 30. I doubt I'll find someone anytime soon, so my internal discussion was ""do I want kids enough to do it by myself?"" That was a resounding no. I don't have the emotional energy to be the center of someone's world. It also just doesn't sound like something I want to tackle all by myself. 

I also thought about what I knew about my parents before they had kids. My parents tried for *10 years.* Both of my parents always knew they wanted to be parents. My mom had a miscarriage before me and was devastated. So I started thinking about my wishy washy feelings about having kids, and decided that I only wanted kids if it was something I couldn't *not* do. If I felt like it was something I absolutely needed and was 100% positive it was something  I wanted. I didn't want any potential kid I might have to ever feel like they were maybe not wanted. 

I haven't had that ""oh my God I *have* to have kids"" moment. I figure if I don't get it over the next 10 years, then I wasn't meant to be a mother. If I do, then I'll take the next steps. But for now, I'm happy loving my dog and my independence.

Sorry for the novel"
truechildfree,ff39aa0,t3_ereumu,1579536708.0,"I'm sure happily married for 20 years+ CF couples have a bone to pick with this statement.

This is the same thing as ""oh you'll change your mind"". Some people just don't accept other people's life choices if they are different then their own.

I once got into an argument with someone I otherwise very much respect, because she told me I was wrong for not wanting to get married. She kept insisting it made the most sense financially, and was implying that couples who don't get married aren't as ""serious"" as people who are. Despite my knowing couples who have been together for decades, had kids, and were more than happy unmarried. I couldn't fathom why she gave 2 shits about what I did with my life.

Some people just get defensive of their own life choices, I think."

I'm so proud of her. I felt eternally guilty about not being able to play or do normal, fun, weekend things. But she napped with me all day until we went to my parents house. Then she cuddled with me on a chair meant for 1 person.

Honestly, she is such a light. Best girl in the world."

Nobody bats an eye that I donâ€™t have kids. My neighborâ€™s are incredibly kind (both my next door neighbor and my neighbor who lives in front of me helped me shovel out of my drive way today). 

Iâ€™ll never be best friends with my neighbors, itâ€™s not my style. But we wave hello, and I know in an emergency we can knock on each otherâ€™s doors for help. Which is perfect for me.

She was having a ton of anxiety sleeping with me in my parents guest bedroom. So I let her sleep where she wants, which is apparently with anybody BUT me. 

I started thinking that maybe she would be happier living with my parents. Sheâ€™s my world, but I want to do whatâ€™s best for her and have her be the happiest she can be. It was just another blow in a pretty shitty last few months.

My parents decided to surprise me and pick me up from work yesterday, with Molly (she loves the car) at one point during the ride, she plopped down and cuddled with me. It melted my whole heart.

For me, it's important to talk about our roles as partners. Do you expect me to do all the cleaning, or is that split 50-50? Do you expect us to merge our finances totally? Are you expecting me to provide for you financially? etc.

I also think it's important to talk about *how* you fight. Arguments will happen, it's inevitable. But discussing what is not tolerated (name calling, yelling, etc) and what is (taking some time to cool off vs wanting to get to the bottom of it right away). Discussing this when you aren't actually in an argument is so important. Because it can so easily lead to resentment. My ex boyfriend used to ignore me for days after an argument. I found this to be incredibly unsettling. We attempted to discuss it (I found it to be manipulative, he said he needed the time to cool off). In the end we just ended up hating each other."

Just to add to OPâ€™s list. She feeds her dog a boutique grain free dog food.

For instance, my uncle was a divorced dad with 3 kids. He did ok, but my mom (his sister) made more money. She and my dad are still together, so having 2 incomes helped. He had the gall to tell my grandmother that my brother and I were spoiled. Iâ€™ve literally seen him 5 times my entire life. So I have no idea how he came to that conclusion.
