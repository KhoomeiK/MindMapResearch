askscience,ffn8jny,t3_eu6tfh,1580063067.0,"I think so. Right now I can't see myself having em. Work takes up so much of my life. So much. For so little. I'm struggling with student debts. I'm struggling to find an apartment I can rent to move out. When I get out of work all I can think of is how work is approaching again.

It makes me not want to do anything. Should I go out with friends? Nah cause I'll get home at 9 or 10 and be more tired at work tomorrow. Better just stay in and rest. 

And all this comes with the ""good"" job I have. It pays ""well"" if it didn't force me to live in a big city I suppose. It has benefits, pension, health insurance for a price people would kill for in this country and still I can barely afford to exist without my parents. 

How the hell am I supposed to add kids on to that? My twenties are almost over and I never even got to enjoy them. The time where people fly the nest. Have a bachelor pad. Go on some vacations. Etc etc. I've just been working....once you throw kids into that mix it's working and then coming home to more work. I'm hoping someday my income stabilizes and I can experience what my twenties were supposed to be in my 30s. Then maybe buy a house in my 40s? I can't see being able to do all that with kids around."

AskReddit,ffgjdbw,t1_ffgh3fo,1579907582.0,"Oof I know the feeling. I've always been an insanely anxious person. I'm still scared of the dark. I can't watch horror films. Needles make me pass out. I don't like vacations because I think of having medical emergencies during them etc etc etc. You name it I'm anxious about it. To the point where it's literally eaten away and stolen my 20s. And two years ago I had my first major panic attack. Went to the hospital and everything.

They're absolutely crippling. I don't know when they're coming now and it's killing me. Also almost no one knows how anxious I am. I try to hide it because I'm anxious about being known as the anxious one???, Does that make sense? Also if you're a man and as anxious as I am most people just scoff or think you're a pussy.
