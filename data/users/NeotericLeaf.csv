Then, I tilt the bed at a 90-degree angle and put the blankets on the floor.  Then I flip the bed upsidedown over the blankets.  Then I put an inflatable raft on top of the upside-down bed and fill it with a lot of salt and some water which makes the water super heavy and dense.  Then, I take off all of my clothes and pay a hooker to wrap my body in 50 boxes worth of saran wrap.  She cuts out a small hole over my mouth and sticks a breathing straw into it.  I proceed to drink as much of the saltwater as I can until I start vomiting through my small breathing hole which makes me look like an abstract art fountain."

Also, even in a blurry video, the likelihood of someone killing themselves with a shotgun while in full stride is minimal to none.  Such lack of logic is more evidence of that OP is an idiot.

You can visit someplace that you have never been before and experience mother nature in all of her glory.  You may meet new people and have new experiences.  You may have intimate moments that are cemented in time by your surroundings.  Spending your money on an experience is much different than spending it on a small piece of jewelry.

Now, what I want to say is that after 10 years of marriage you would think that you both would fully understand that a healthy relationship between life partners is in no way shape or form defined by the value of the wedding ring.  I mean, how on earth did you two ever survive with a fake diamond on your finger!?

Why would you waste your money on a ""real"" ring?  Wouldn't it have been better off invested in a shared experience?  A cruise?  Something that would form an actual substantiative memory?  On your death bed, would you rather look down to a diamond or would you rather look down on your other less costly wedding ring that is still just as sentimentally valuable while also having the memories that a shared vacation could bring?

To each their own, but I just wish people weren't so tricked into believing that rocks and metals signify their self worth or the importance of their relationship to another."

MovieDetails,fbybp1z,t1_fby9wdn,1577212901.0,"The problem is that well-known critics become a means to their own end.  They can no longer break from the mold that they've designed.  They've seen thousands and thousands of movies and are no longer able to differentiate between what is a masterpiece and what is good or unique.  By that, I mean that it becomes very difficult for them to enjoy nuanced films that have a niche.  They can't ignore plot holes or spotty acting to be able to realize and encapsulate the sum of the work.  Their heads are full of formulas and predispositions.

The same can be said for food critics.  Their palate becomes biased.  Things start to seem derivative.  They too harshly critique something for not living up to the standard of something else.

Once critics reach this level of scrutiny they typecast themselves into only being able to enjoy certain kinds of movies.  Many become too serious and can not overlook flaws that would not matter to the general public.

Yes, you don't have to be good at something or even do something to give constructive criticism about it, but at the end of the day you are but one person telling others how they should probably feel or view the art.  If you haven't made the art then maybe you just aren't *getting* what the artist was going for."
