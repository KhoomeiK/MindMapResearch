Everything I wrote is half in jest, except when I said my dog is the most beautiful dog in the world, and the fact that you're not acknowledging or accepting that is really worrying to me."
dogs,fdxtl4f,t1_fdxqe5u,1578772795.0,">people are not obligated to fawn over your dog.

But this is wrong.

Or true I guess, but if they don't then I can tell they're clearly deranged or deficient in some form or fashion."
dogs,fdxp5jo,t1_fduon8e,1578771430.0,">Does she also does this weird howling like ""aaaaawawawawawaaaa"" ?? 

Yes! It's probably one of my favourite sounds and is often paired with a looooong stretch and bow like you said! When we leave to do errands we always get a good yodeling when we come home and we love it."
dogs,fdxfcsh,t1_fdwe08i,1578768158.0,">Cute dog but not unusually beautiful

You're gonna make me come untethered. She's the finest specimen there ever was and if you can't see that then **you're** the joke, pal!"

dogs,fdxawjb,t1_fdvq5hq,1578766997.0,"Just *okay*? OKAY?
 
You have just made a lifelong enemy my ~~friend~~ enemy."
dogs,fdx9smt,t1_fdvnby6,1578766731.0,"I'm deadly serious. You're not suggesting she isn't the most beautiful dog you've ever seen, are you? I'm ready to throw down if things really have to be that way.

I'll give you one more chance to call her gorgeous.."
dogs,fdx8y4o,t1_fdu80pn,1578766433.0,"Her name is Briar!

Yours is beautiful too - is she as soft as she looks?"
dogs,fdtrz4i,t1_fdtc5q5,1578721281.0,"The more time we spend with them the more beautiful they are.

I love a good prolonged staring session sprawled sideways across the the floor, basking in that glow she radiates."
dogs,fdtqvgl,t1_fdtc0l5,1578720791.0,"Thank you! And yes, Those kind of compliments are great too, especially since she *is* so well behaved and we have, like you said, both worked hard for that.

And in those moments when she isn't I get that she's just saying ""like you know I'm a wild animal right? you can't fully control me if that's what you think because I feel like you're under the impression you can just tell me what to do and I'm always gonna listen but that's not totally accurate and here's why"" in her own way and I can accept and appreciate that."
dogs,fdtqm4m,t1_fdtc17y,1578720672.0,"He was beautiful. What was his favourite thing to do? Did he like to talk and sing like mine?

Moths to a flame is pretty accurate. I remember when she was just a puppy how constant the attention she got was - nearly every person we would pass when we were out with her would ask to say hello or pet her - I think that's why now she loves to stare at people whenever we go for walks.. like just zero in on somebody, could be across the street or walking towards her, wherever, and just sit and stare until either I can convince her to keep moving or they acknowledge her and come say hi."
mountandblade,fdqkvep,t1_fdqguzk,1578669113.0,"Ouch. So what are you plans when Bannerlord comes out? 

Or should I not have even asked that?

What battle size setting are you using? Most mods shouldn't perform too much differently from Native, especially if you adjust the battle sizes, but I might be underestimating just how weak your computer is. Do you struggle to run Native, too?"
mountandblade,fdqafkr,t1_fdp9wpi,1578661117.0,"You got it.

Check it out even if you're not really into LotR - I'm not but for some reason I'm hooked on TLD.

Has a few features that make it play differently from Native, most notably the recruitment system and the way money works.. of which there is none - completing quests or selling items will get you 'resource points' for the specific faction you're dealing with - those resource points are then used as your currency for buying gear and supplies as well as 'paying' your troops."
skyrimvr,fdq9cxw,t1_fdpxraa,1578660085.0,"Thanks for the advice, though the reason I even decided to replay Skyrim was after learning about Wabbajack because it was all automated - I really don't have the time or patience to spend hours or days manually downloading and installing mods again, even with the help of a guide.

I might just have to, though - how long would you think I'd have to spend following that guide to get everything running? An evening? A couple?

Thanks again! It's a real bummer because I've had heavily modded Skyrim VR running fine before, but I recently reinstalled Windows and lost my old installation."
mountandblade,fdq4bz6,t1_fdpxpur,1578654222.0,"[The Last Days of the Third Age](https://tldmod.github.io/)

I'm not even really more than a very casual fan of LOTR / Tolkien but this mod has me hooked - for some reason slaughtering orcs is just really satisfying."
skyrimvr,fbvndgk,t1_fbvexyr,1577133307.0,"Interesting - your machine is considerably more powerful than mine so if you're having issues there's not much hope for me.

Have you done any testing with vanilla or a separate selection of mods?"
