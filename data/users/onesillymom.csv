sex,fgrgpsl,t3_f035kq,1581046387.0,"What really upsets me is the “ Don’t talk about sex, it’s awkward” mentally.  It is a natural act that almost every species does. I read a comment on here of a couple that discussed everything, likes, fantasies, boundaries and what not before having sex. Sorry if a little off topic but a healthy attitude might make everyone more open to their partners needs and wants instead of just a hurry up and finish mentality."

AskReddit,fgr5yn5,t1_fgr4ik5,1581038968.0,It is almost comical how we seem have polar opposite views on almost anything. So much so when we agree both of us are a little taken aback. I think we each found something we were lacking in ourselves in the other person. He is very decisive where as I take forever to decide. He is a Black and white kinda person where as I am a shades of Grey person.

AskReddit,ffhvarr,t1_ffgi3sz,1579955564.0,"I am FIRM believer that Men and woman’s brains are hard wired a tad bit different. Think about when people were still Hunters and Gatherers. Men went out as a group to hunt but had to work silently, while women were spread out gathering things out of sight but close enough to talk to make sure everyone was safe. Made complete sense to me."
