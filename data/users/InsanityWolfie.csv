While it's true that it's a bit cynical, I think the human population has exploded past the point where we need to worry about ensuring everyone lives to a ripe age. So many good things would happen if humans had a decently sized culling event.  The environment would recover a little, labor would be less expendable and thus more profitable to the worker, endangered animals would havr a chance to restock their own populations, the oceans could be cleaned faster than we've been dirtying it.
