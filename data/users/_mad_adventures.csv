He went to Harvard, and was a math professor before isolating himself in the wilderness because of a hatred for our government. His brother's wife figured it out once the FBI released one of his letters. Apparently they'd exchanged letters before becoming estranged, and he had a very particular writing style, and wrote a lot about his beliefs in his letters. They recognized his handwriting as well. If it weren't for his brother, he would've probably gotten away with much more. 

Funny fact, he gets(got) letters from Harvard for reunions and gatherings, and he always sends them back, and under the address, or occupation (if asked) he puts ""Prison""."

You're trying to dance around my main point to discredit it. The whole point of my original comment, was that that dude sucked, and was slapping with his fist. That's not a punch at all, not even a hook. It's a fist slap, and if you think he's doing anything else, then you've probably never been in a fight in your life.

Yes, I understand a hook can be powerful, if it's executed. This guy reminds me of my sister when she was 8, attacking me for stealing her toy. Literally punching like an 8 year old girl, who has never punched before.
