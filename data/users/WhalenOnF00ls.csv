Some of the backstory for the character (who's going to be a character I end up modeling eventually) is that he's like the Blood Angels' version of Horus Aximand- so similar in appearance to Sanguinius that it's often joked that my character is Sanguinius' offspring. He's known as '[x], The Golden' or 'Youthful [x],' and was one of Sanguinius' favorite and most trusted of his sons."

Also, one person with a gun can take down a lot of people before he gets dropped. And in a crowd like this where everyone is armed, everyone returning fire would make the situation much more dangerous, especially for first responders."
HumansBeingBros,ff5n0yr,t1_ff5mf30,1579601075.0,"Yes. 

""Three bills passed the state Senate on Thursday: A limit to one handgun purchase per month, a requirement for universal background checks on gun sales and a rule allowing localities to ban guns in some public areas. A proposal for a ""red flag"" law, which would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from anyone deemed dangerous to themselves or others, is also being considered.""

HumansBeingBros,ff5mta7,t1_ff5jdeq,1579600748.0,"Nobody is calling those guys white supremacists. People were anxious because they *expected* white supremacists to show up- which they did, for the record (Alex Jones, *et al*)- but there wasn't any violence, which is good. 

Members of a Neo-Nazi terrorist group were arrested last week due to threats they made against the rally today."
