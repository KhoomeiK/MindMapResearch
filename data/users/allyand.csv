LoveIslandTV,feyz00b,t1_feyqsom,1579452241.0,Also American and also require subtitles and googling of slang phrases. Usually I can figure it out from context but when I first started watching I was confused a lot.

books,fek52q9,t3_epjpdd,1579192777.0,"My elementary school library had shelves for each grade level of reading. When I was in 2nd grade I wanted to check out the Nancy Drew books but it was at a higher grade level and I wasn’t allowed. My dear, sweet teacher went home and brought her daughter’s collection of Nancy Drew books for me to read. I was always advanced in reading & reading comprehension. To say that books are “age-inappropriate”  could be hindering advanced or gifted & talented students."

thebachelor,fe6krbi,t3_enytv5,1578894154.0,I feel like she needs to pull a Tyler C. She should date someone for a little like Tyler did with Gigi so the public will think she’s moved on Bach men and then hopefully she can move forward in relative peace with her future relationships.

trashy,fdk7156,t3_elqugh,1578497535.0,I had a boyfriend use a gun to aid his commands of me not going out for happy hour with friends on weeknights. This is not a joke. This is not funny. A lot of women are killed by their partners.
trashy,fdk6v74,t3_elqugh,1578497428.0,That makes my stomach hurt to look at.
thebachelor,fdk63rp,t1_fdj5njh,1578496927.0,He literally knew her by name before she said her own name. I feel that it is highly unlikely he would’ve remembered her name if it was just a brief meeting. He’s probably met hundreds of girls between Ette and Bach filming.
thebachelor,fdj3hox,t1_fdipkh7,1578457455.0,I agree. It did not seem like it was their first time being affectionate with one another
thebachelor,fdj2fxv,t1_fdidf62,1578456699.0,I liked her too! I was expecting her to be awful but she was funny and relatable - especially when she was laughing at herself when she introduced herself to peter for the first time. It was endearing.

thebachelor,fdfy7po,t3_el6cbt,1578373544.0,My parents have been married for 27 years but that doesn’t make me more prepared for marriage than someone else. Peter really annoyed me by making it a priority. You can’t pick your family.
thebachelor,fdfsg74,t3_el3jau,1578369070.0,This makes me hope that he’s not with anyone from his season and that HB and Peter are back together

MakeupRehab,fcfanli,t3_eh3axw,1577628103.0,The same thing happened to me. One day I just realized that I need all of this stuff and I was going broke keeping up with high end make up. I’ve kinda fallen off with all the beauty gurus I used to watch. I still like putting make up on but that thrill of buying new is gone.
Columbus,fccy348,t1_fc6pbca,1577604032.0,The woman hit is my cousin. She is still in critical condition. Any and all prayers and positive thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
