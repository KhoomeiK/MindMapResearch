Seems like an important question for most humans to have awareness, understanding, and answers to. Below is my thrown together list off the top of my head.

AWARENESS

* In my understanding, ""feed my soul"" usually describes:

1. satisfied/success/fulfilled (full-filled)) mindset after accessing (consciously or unconsciously) the time and efforts investments of our life, along with
2. a brain that has properly regulating pleasure/happiness chemicals (dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins...) (see common chemical regulators below)

* Note how many times your sentences focused on you (""I"", ""my"")
* Our human brain has evolved to activate reward chemicals for behaviors (listed below) that help our survival and thrival. Doing things that avoid/skip/short cut/pseudo replicate, the actual behaviors end up artificially activating these chemical and end up not 'feeding our soul'.

1. tribal support (helping others, others helping us)
2. eating healthy foods,
3. moving (exercising, dancing...)
4. rest
5. social acceptance
6. sufficient resources
7. mutual intimacy...

MOVING TOWARDS

1. Sociecentric service - Feeding other people's souls/bodies/minds... e.g. volunteer or remunerated service to others, produce a helpful product and/or service to help reduce problems/suffering and increase survival/thrival
2. Activities that naturally stimulate your brain's reward chemicals

MOVING AWAY FROM

1. less hyper-egocentrism (selfishness) focus
2. most/all unnatural brain chemical stimulants: recreational (What creation? > pseudo-creation) drugs, nutrient faking foods (foods with added sweeteners, fats, spices...), artificial reproduction/intimacy (porn), hoarding (resource obesity), artificial sleeping aids,"

Or could you learn to love you and other people at the same time?  


What I see common in the self-improvement world is a desire for one silver bullet/golden hammer analogy/example that can be used for all areas, for all situations/scenarios, rather than seeking or stating this is just one analogy/example option and here are few others (that may be polar opposites). Pick what best suits the situation."
selfimprovement,feubc6r,t1_feskbsb,1579384936.0,"Re: ""You can’t pour from an empty cup"" 

Why is the cup empty? Have you/they not been maintaining win-win relationships and allowing others to fill your cup? 

Where is this cup being poured? If you/they are pouring your filled cup into others, is that not hypocritical of the claim that one needs to first fill their own cup? "

Can humans learn and receive self-care simultaneously or does it require isolation and separation?

Re: ""In the event of an emergency please put on your own gas mask before attempting to help other""

Two hands can work simultaneously to put on two masks for two people. Placing a mask on a face only requires one hand, not two. Two hands may be required to secure the mask."
selfimprovement,feu5yqv,t3_eqe792,1579383397.0,"""putting myself... first""

Q: Is this type of thinking/argument\* more like:

* A) non-connected **isolation** & in **series**\*\* thinking or
* B) interconnected **systems** & in **parallel**\*\*\* thinking?

\*claim with premises and conclusion

\*\*one thing happens only after another thing happens. e.g. I can only take care of others after I take care of myself.

\*\*\*multiple things can be done at the same time - e.g. I can both take care of myself AND others

My experience is that many people have been taught (indoctrinated) to think myopically (narrowly), convergently (vs divergently), in series... so they tend to think there is only one 'right' way/answer to: problems, life, self-improvement..."
