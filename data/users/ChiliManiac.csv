StarTrekDiscovery,ffksvuc,t3_eu3swh,1580028280.0,"Agreed, I don't think control was created by accident and put into the continuity of canon without a very valid reason, control will be an interesting sub context to talk about artificial intelligence even for those who've never seen a piece of Star Trek Discovery. I think you're right here. The best part about Picard is that the mystery grows even deeper with the events of season 2 and Didn't they band Holograms at the end of s2 of Discovery? So why does she have access to this hologram? Good points all around."

Main reason I’m looking at linear switches is after 8 hours the movements on tactical switches feel way different than after long gaming sessions vs long typing session. I think it’s maybe that you do a lot more action while typing. Probably would be ok for a game like Star Craft with lots of keybinding short cuts but for fps 8 hours of wasd is a total drag"

Oh, also have an a g910 with romers that I like for mmo’s but for long session of FPS gaming I find the tactility to be a burden.

The Trek community isn't good at recognizing brilliance till 20 years after the fact. DS9 being a loved show by the whole community is a new phenomena that started with the advent of streaming. Enterprise was absolutely hated when it launched with many of the same complaints as Discovery and TNG before it.

Picard,ffa19j3,t1_ffa0h3s,1579725857.0,"Totally, watching Babylon 5 and then DS9 right after(or was it before?) was always a special treat for me when I got home from elementary school.

startrek,ff9ryre,t1_ff9r1ed,1579719881.0,"And for what it’s worth, the federation didn’t want Picard involved with the fight because of Trauma in the first place, if he had obeyed that order they all would have been dead anyway."
startrek,ff9reb4,t1_ff9r1ed,1579719440.0,"Lol, if you’re calling me a troll you don’t know me very well or my contributions to this sub. I see your comment as self righteous pandering to your own personal image of how Picard should behave or act, its length does not add to it’s quality. I don’t hard disagree with you but I do think you’re wrong, mostly cause getting a brand spanking new ship only to have the borg confront you and try and alter the earths timeline would do that to most people with trauma."
startrek,ff9pyq5,t1_ff9p689,1579718361.0,"I actually agree with him shooting the character, but you must not have watched it after the part because Lily tears him a new one for it. He let the man die a human death instead of letting his consciousness get taken over by an alien bent on earths destruction, the medical labs weren’t available either. 

Finally, do you never want your characters to evolve and only see them as how you want them to behave? Doesn’t sound very fun or imaginative to me."

The passion of Orville fans is supplanted from their anger and confusion of Discovery differences, and Axanar’s failure to take the rights from Star Trek cause a lot of them actually thought they could do it. Basically this whole tussle is cause of proud individuals letting their egos get a hold of them and in turn hurting the fans they loved.
