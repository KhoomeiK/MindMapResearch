God isn't a term nor created by ignorance. if any sort of time it's the past 100 200 years. why did some people make up a God to explain the beginning? because back then people were smart enough to know that it's impossible for nothing to create everything. the cause had to be a creator God outside all time space and matter inorder to create it. that's what science proves that there was a definite beginning, what scientists doesn't prove or could it is the beginning and God. it's like a computer program trying to connect to the outside using only inside ways, it can't.

so how can anyone, even from thousands of years ago to today, can wake up and say to themselves all this universe made itself. you can't say it's always been here because then where'd it come from? it's only recently that people don't want to believe in God and use falsely so-called science to prove it.

evolution isn't real, sure micro evolution or adaptation happens but never does it change kinds or family species. bacteria always stay bacteria even though it's changed from its parents, fish stay fish dog stay dogs. never does science prove it evolution into something else.

so think about how life could become in the first place. put rocks in water with a battery and see if life comes about. think about it. watch Stephen Meyer he explains the probability of life coming about, 10 to the 196 or something. so if you had earth filled out with amino acids to its best environment possible for it to assemble into proteins and DNA and cells, it would take trillions of years if at all amino acids came together in that specific order for life to begin. it's like putting a frog in a blender and asking how many shakes does it take for it to come back together whole? it's so improbable it's impossible."

in the beginning... everything was in a tiny dot? that's so not scientific.
ya there was nothing, then God being outside all time space matter, created everything that is time space matter.

so even ancient man is smarter than people today even those who say they are wise, are fools. (that's in the Bible).
ancient people knew there was a God behind the cause to the universe, they didn't know which so they made up one. Except for the Israelites who knew God for experiencing God, and wrote about Him in the Bible, that's how we know which God is true.

and if anyone says why God didn't write the Bible himself. well if God did then you would be in denial of it. so there's no winning that.

and to say you don't believe in God because you haven't seen Him. you don't need to see to know there's a God. you look at a painting and KNOW there's a painter. looking at creation we Know there's a creator.
