fatlogic,ff9z0do,t3_es0o2z,1579724539.0,"I mean they make some good points, I don’t think obese people deserve to be publicly shamed especially by people they don’t know (because generally it’s not with good intentions) but I also want to point out that there are very very few underweight people compared to overweight and obese people in developed countries, especially the US. If being underweight was as rampant a public health issue as obesity is, then we would see a proportional shaming of underweight people."
