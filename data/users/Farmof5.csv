In my experience, kids typically pull their heads out of their asses in their 30s or when they have kids.

Tween years are just as hard (if not worse) as teen years. The body changes, hormones going nuts, & social pressure. Even with a “perfect” home life, that crap is super hard on kids & parents. Would you be willing/able to do family talk counseling?

Adoption,ffxlzef,t3_evrum5,1580327840.0,"Adopted kid here. I hated the name they gave me but never knew my bio given name because it was a closed adoption. In college I did a full legal name change. Dropped what I hated & added what I wanted. I used a hyphen to keep my adopted Dad’s surname to try to make him happy. So I went from being Jane Doe Smith to Doe Fox Brown-Smith. (Needless to say, not my real names given here). Dad didn’t speak to me for 6 months but after that he came to accept it. I get I’m his only kid but I’m female. So here in the US, I was expected to change my surname at marriage anyway. 

Concerning others accepting it...I simply walked into class after the change happened & said “yo bitches, I changed my name”. Aside from family being butthurt because everything is all about them, people are very chill with this sort of thing. 

If you’re willing to accept the potential family fallout &/or its what you need to be happy, then change your name baby. It’s your life, your body, your decision, your responsibility. You know your family best so warn them/explain how you feel before or after depending on how you think they’ll take it.

Edit: No, it’s not wrong to want to change your name. You are allowed to feel!!! You are allowed to be your own person!!!!! No one else in the world is just like you & that’s part of what makes you special/amazing!!!!
Concerning compromise, you could give them special permission to address you by the name they gave you? No matter what, you’ll let your parents down at various points in life because you’re human. This isn’t about them, this is about you being you. Even if they’re mad at first, good parents get over anger...eventually."

On our mobile quail run, we use plastic corrugated roofing panels. We have those at the bottom, going 2 feet high, all the way around the run. We do that because quail like to be hidden (their mental health/less stress), they hide the quail from predators line of sight, & it blocks the worst of inclement weather for them. During the Winter we use clear plastic corrugated roofing panels higher up (between where the bottom panels stop & the roof line) on 3 sides to give them a green house affect. Then remove them once it gets warm again. 

What kind of predators do you have in your area?
We use plastic panels because it’s a mobile run/coop set up. Since you’re talking about doing a permanent setup, metal might be a better option for the panels (metal will make predators work harder but nothing is perfect). Because ours is light weight & mobile, the day will come when a bear plows through the electric fence & simply lifts the run up for a snack. 

Are you in a windy spot? 
Doing panels 2 feet high will block snow drifts but not block air flow. You could also use tarps on the sides as temporary weather blockers. 
During the Winter, we get wind gusts up to 45 miles per hour. Thankfully, wind has only lifted/moved the quail run once. Now we’re far more careful about the direction it’s facing when we move it. 

What kind of roof are you thinking? Clear plastic will let UV light in to help kill germs & give your hens Vitamin D but won’t be as strong as metal. If you use metal (maybe plastic too?), you can do a rain catch system that can go into the chicken’s waterers. (Not shingles though, the petroleum gets into the water). 

What kind of cleaning/sanitation are you hoping for? The problem with a permanently covered run is that Mother Nature can’t clean it for you. Rain/snow melt washes the poo away."

I’ve seen heated mat walkways for chickens but haven’t used one. You plug it in, then roll it out from their door to their feeder. Not sure it would be worth the money. 

Make sure you give them boredom busters during the crappy days. Like hang a cabbage like a piñata for them to peck at. Happy chickens are peaceful chickens. 

As long as your coop is well built (proper insulation & proper venting) they should be fine. The ventilation is key. The moisture built up from their breathing in the coop is the main cause for frostbite. If you have hens (or Roos) with large combs you may need to put Vaseline on their combs to prevent frostbite.

chickens,ff8tpeu,t3_erfzin,1579695722.0,"You seem confused about the laying process. Hopefully, this helps clear it up a bit. 

In order to lay eggs, a chicken needs 25 hours of light. Not heat. As babies they need heat because that fluff isn’t nearly as good as feathers for warmth. As adults, they can generally handle whatever weather as it comes provided they have good shelter. Those with larger combs do better in the heat but have a higher chance of getting frostbite. 

Molting (losing current feathers & growing new ones) takes place in the Fall because *normally/most places* that’s when it’s not too hot & not too cold. The amounts of calcium & protein needed to replace feathers, as well as carbs to regulate body temperature, is far too high for the chicken to be able to continue to produce eggs at the same time. 

You can use supplemental lighting in the Winter (once molting is done) to get them laying again. You can use string lights (like spare Christmas tree lights) or a normal light bulb. Whatever lighting method you use, make sure the chickens can’t touch it & make sure it’s not a fire risk. You want to give them 15 hours of total light a day (so figure out how many hours the sun is up & add what’s needed to make 15 hours continuous). 

If you choose to do supplemental lighting, here are things you need to know:
-Do NOT leave the lights in 24/7. Without 6-8 hour of darkness/rest, you will destroy the chickens immune system. (Their bodies don’t work on making eggs in the dark, they take a break). 
-You don’t want to shock their systems. So you need to introduce them to fake light in 15 minute increments, not just flip the light on & walk away. 
-If you accidentally skip a day of fake light, you run the risk of sending them into another molting cycle. 
-Be aware that you are over taxing the chickens body & mother nature’s natural break for her. You will be shorting her life."

Here in the US, it’s mandated that you wash your eggs if you’re going to sell them. Washing the eggs removes the Bloom (clear protective/antimicrobial coating) & supposedly washes away salmonella as well. For commercial operations, those precautions make sense. For small farms/backyard chicken keepers...meh. Only 4% of backyard flocks have tested positive for salmonella & I couldn’t find any data on sample size, who ran the study, who funded the study, what controls were laid out, or anything remotely useful in validating that claim.

My 3rd grade teacher was so hateful & mean to me that my dad had to take a day off of work to stand in the back of the class to intimidate her. My 5th grade teacher told my parents & me that I’d end up in jail because I sassed her once. & my 6th grade teacher told my parents & me I’d be lucky to hold down a minimum wage job at McDonald’s for the rest of my life."

Pro tip: try savory toppings if sweet isn’t your thing. Hubby put sun dried tomatoes, feta, & various roasted veggies in his. 
If sweet is your thing, try adding hot chocolate powder or leftover icing when you make a cake. All our foster kids love when I make s’mores oatmeal (hot chocolate powder, crushed up graham crackers, & small marshmallows). It’s the gentlest way to introduce a healthy food."

homestead,fetnv4i,t1_fetdcn3,1579377370.0,"When you go to the grocery store & see white eggs, those come from White Leghorns. The brown eggs come from Golden Buff/Red Star/Sex Link (same chicken just different names depending on where you are) chickens. Those 2 breeds usually start laying at 4 months old, are physically on the smaller side, & are absolute egg laying machines. Commercial operations never let their chickens get over 18 months old because that’s when laying starts to drop off (God forbid the poor girl not give you an egg every 25 hours). Bear in mind that they use artificial lighting to push maximum egg production. 

The first year of a chickens life they are more likely to give you pullet eggs (size small to medium) because their body is working on figuring things out. If they are born in the Fall, they have the Winter to mature so are less likely to give you pullet eggs but are more likely to view the nest box as a sleeping place instead of the roost bars (I only have a theory why). 

Our neighbors buy their birds at 6 months old because that’s the average laying age. You will pay more for older chickens because someone put a lot of time & good chunk of money into raising them. Theirs stay in a coop without a run 24/7 & they use artificial light. They only have Golden Buffs/sex links (large light brown eggs). Every year they send their chickens to a guy & we assume but don’t know for sure what happens to them. Then they get new ones. 

We raise ours from 1 day old chicks because we want a relationship with our chickens, know their health history, nutrition is/was sound, & each personality. Each breed has its own price tag/each hatchery has its shipping minimums. Ours are pastured with a movable coop. Ours are a mixed flock that gives us a ton of egg colors. Our favorites get to stay, the others go to freezer camp when laying goes down too far (usually 4 years old) to justify cost. Also, as foster parents, we legally can’t afford unfriendly animals so we work hard to make them all family members. 

Out of our mixed flock, we have 3 favorites so far...White Leghorn gives us white eggs. Black Copper Maran gives us chocolate colored eggs. & Easter Eggers that give us blue/green eggs. I keep spread sheets (for everything in the farm) & track date, egg weight, who is laying, weather, notes section (like coyote visits), etc. These have been our tops layers no matter what. We let Mother Nature do her thing (artificial light shortens the hens life & hurts her overall health so that’s not our cup of tea). Those 3 breeds have also been high on the sweetest & most loving list. Orpingtons are super sweet but not power layers. I F***ing hate our Australorps, not great layers & total a-holes (at least in our experience). Next Fall we will be getting our first Sex Link so I can’t vouch for them yet. 

If you get 1 day old chicks, do you have the time to check on them & handle them every hour for the first week of life? Are you willing & able to deal with paste butt? (Withhold food for the first 2 hrs to avoid that, give water like normal though). Do you want to invest in all of the equipment for baby chicks? Are you aware of the fire risk that comes with heat lamps vs the price tag of heated plates (what we use)? Are they going to free range? Some breeds tolerate confinement better than others. Do you know how to train them to go “home” at night? Are you ready for the predators in your area?"

homestead,fet5a7l,t3_eoskx2,1579371936.0,"Depends on your state/locality, what animal, how/why it died. Start with your local County Extension Office &/or Game Warden.  

Depending on where you are, there might be specific laws/ordinances governing what/how/etc you can do. 

Fire: For example we have burn restrictions where we are (time of day & time of year). 

Disease: If the critter dies of a disease, you don’t want that shit to spread so you gotta figure out what you’re dealing with & the best disposal method. & you may need to report it. Hemorrhagic Disease & Chronic Wasting Disease are common deer issues in our area. When we see a fresh/non violently ended dead Bambi on our property, we take its head & liver in for testing or put it in the freezer until we can take it in. 

When we first moved out here, years ago, some nasty cow eye disease (not pink eye) was being spread around on the wind. Our strictly indoor cat with an autoimmune disorder ended up with it because we had the windows open to air the farts out of the house. Our vet was at a total loss with how to deal with it & it sucked beyond words. We didn’t know about the cow disease until we spoke with our neighbor weeks later. 
Another example is Black Leg, it can be spread by ground water & stay in the soil for years. Don’t bury those bodies! 

Digging: Let’s say ‘ole Bess done broke her leg & has to simply be put down. (& you love her far too much to eat her). You don’t want to attract predators. If there aren’t laws against it, you can bury her. But make sure it’s at least 6 feet deep or she’ll get dug up by hungry critters. Also, digging a hole for a cow, horse, etc/big critter is best done by machinery. It’s too much by hand unless you have an entire football team of strapping young men at your disposal."
