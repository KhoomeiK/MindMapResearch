Worthwhile idea entirely relative but shit like this is all about research and development and studies. If the guy drives highway mostly and can get 60+ (which is probably on the low end) then he's increasing that from 45/48. I've had 2 priuses and that's what we got at 65mph, so an additional 33%on efficiency is hardly retarded.

In middle school I told my friends to say ""soy maricone"" to the mexican kids, i said it meant ""I am American"" and was an easy slght to those who might be illegal and inferred the rest are. SOY does mean ""I am"" but mericone means faggot.

My parents met at work, landscaping company (we're white btw, but my dad is fleunt in spanish). Every friday the workers would hang out  by the entrance of the building, 10 story multi business, white collar etc, and my mom was a book keeper and wanted to say something to them to hang out elsewhere while she gets their checks.  So my dad gives her a phrase,  Friday rolls around,  and she she goes out ""chinga tu madre, Chinga tu madre!"" Yeah they left.... chinga tu madre means fuck your mother.  Yes this happened, both my parents confirmed it and my dad still laughs his ass off when telling that story, yes they're divorced. 

So I very much believe OP because aside from my stories, I've seen it happen."

My questions
1) why did Volvo head towards him? 

2) why didn't Volvo warn him? )

3) did Volvo lose traction?  Looks like he didn't. 

4) what was the guy doing at the CORNER of his car stopped on the side of the road? tires don't go there.

5)was this the side of the road? 

6) why was the camera facing that direction?  Most rear cams face straight, not at an angle.

7) what tipped him off, why'd he turn around and look?  Surely the sounds of the other cars were louder than the idling volvo, I assume he was idling as he didn't appear to be accelerating. 

8) where was this?

9) when was this?

10) and why was he smiling? Was it the ""holy shit I screwed death!?"""

See the the Nissan come into view RIGHT behind the turning car making it impossible to see him at all? See as he enters and the light immediately turns left? See as the Nissan almost side swipes the stopped car? I would only TECHNICALLY be at fault due to crossing traffic however he was going an excessive speed and his relative movement to the cars before him during the green is a testament to that, and entering an intersection at that speed during a yellow light would probably flip the liability. Obviously I don't go based off lights as you can clearly see me waiting for traffic to be clear and clearly you see him appear out of nowhere.  The camera being wider and higher sees things I dont see, sooner, so imagine how late I saw him"
