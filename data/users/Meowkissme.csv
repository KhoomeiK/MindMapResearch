legaladvice,ffcd0ix,t1_ffcct92,1579796805.0,How is changing ones address through the UPS website bad or illegal? It is literally what OP was asking for.
legaladvice,ffcajke,t3_ess5nw,1579795254.0,"You can change anyone's address online for only 1 dollar. It will start forwarding any of her mail to whatever address you put in.

Watsky,ff8xfcs,t1_ff8ric0,1579699221.0,"The album has been sold out for months. Yes it is listed on the site, but it is not and has not been available. A copy has never sold or been listed on ebay and the last copy sold on discogs was in 2018 for 50 bucks. I am sure he will have no problem selling it."

fightporn,feojrv7,t1_fen3h7q,1579301107.0,The one and only fight I have witnessed while working at my old job involved a mentally challenged man picking another slightly obese man up 3 feet into the air and slamming him down on the table. Breaking the table and the mans rib cage in the process. I think it may have even been with one hand.
MensRights,fenhxya,t3_epzgnc,1579285073.0,"That sub kills me. I read an entire thread about how men need to fix their own depression/personal problems before trying to date women, as it is not fair to the women to have to ""deal with that shit"". But then a top post the next day was about how if a man can't handle your emotional problems and basically doesn't treat you like a child when you are stressed/psychotic/etc, then he doesn't deserve them. 

Talk about double fucking standards."

RWBY,fdncu4l,t3_em3gvg,1578583055.0,Cool but the relic is magic and doesn't really care about any of those stupid science bitches.
dataisbeautiful,fdnbs88,t3_em8via,1578582377.0,I said this on here before and I will say it again. Trump golfs MORE than season pass holders at the golf course I work at. MORE THAN DOZENS OF MEN WHO ARE RETIRED.
witcher,fdnal43,t1_fdna648,1578581595.0,"Ohhh, that makes sense. So would you say the show follows the books more than the game?"
witcher,fdnahnj,t1_fdn9pw2,1578581531.0,Me? Nah dude. But someone else might have because it was answered 3 times before you did.
witcher,fdn98gt,t1_fdn8v0g,1578580653.0,"Didn't catch her name in the show, but guess she's in it. Shoulda kept her hair red."

ThriftStoreHauls,fdk858j,t1_fdk19os,1578498258.0,"My cousins grandfather hid cash all throughout their house that they didn't find until years after he died. Stacks of money in the old piano, record player, projector, vents, old appliances, everywhere. They even found some in the clothes of the grams old doll collection. Thankfully they think most or close to all of it was found. 

But I stay checking anything that opens or has some kind of compartment at thrift stores lol."
9anime,fdk1i3j,t3_elct0a,1578493729.0,"Try typing the first episode into google video and search for one the works. You can remove all youtube/crunchyroll results etc by putting ""-youtube"" etc at the end of the search. Look for ones that are 23min (about the length of episodes) and once you find one that works, you can use that same site for the rest of them."
9anime,fdk13d8,t3_elo7qw,1578493432.0,"Just start using another site. These sites never last long, it started with kissanime then 9anime. It gets to the point where there are too many ads and viruses and shit that they can't fix anything.

aww,fcu6r2l,t1_fct3mim,1577973894.0,"They sell these books that are like questionnaires you give to your parents/grandparents to fill out. Some of them are really personal questions. My sister got my grandmother one last year. We went to visit her every weekend and would ask her the questions and write down the answers. Some of the simplest questions were the best to ask. I'll never forget the smile and response to ""Have you ever kissed anyone under the stars?"". She passed away a few months ago. We only got about half the book done but my sister and I absolutely cherish it."

pokemon,fc58q9c,t1_fc4spik,1577448886.0,"My dad said something similar when I asked for some cards for Christmas (also 27). He made fun of me at first and he must have felt bad for it because he got me a couple little collection sets with keychains, figures etc in it. He's a good guy."
news,fc58jt0,t1_fc517hz,1577448650.0,"If you are in the states and you got your license between 18 and 25, you were probably automatically signed up when you went to the DMV.  They literally can not make you a license/id/permit etc unless you have one. It's just included in the shit you sign when getting a license. There are a few states where this isn't linked though.

""2. Automatic, where a man, age 18 through age 25, consents to have his information automatically transferred to Selective Service for registration when he applies for a state learner’s permit, driver’s license or renewal, or I.D. card.

Twenty-seven states and two territories have driver’s license legislation which automatically registers men with the Selective Service System."""
AskReddit,fc39ac9,t3_efun3j,1577384566.0," When I was 7, a disgruntled ex set the house on fire across the street from me. There were several women living there, all with several kids. I watched, but mainly heard, from my bedroom window the women throwing their children out of the upper floor windows to bystanders down on the street. I will never forget the collective screaming of all the kids and their moms. A three year old and a three month old died.

PKMNTCGDeals,fbyosf6,t1_fbej8wm,1577222387.0,I bought 4 boxes to get the free shipping (42.25 total). Literally got nothing good from the first two boxes. I then pulled the holo charizard from Evolutions and a Solgaelo GX and Primarina GX hyper rares from the SM base packs. They about cover the cost so I may buy some more.
