SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ffe7fzm,t1_ffc3ubr,1579838735.0,"You can immediately 5-star the following characters from events in the journey guide:

1. GMY with any 5 Jedi
2. Thrawn and Palpatine with Phoenix
3. R2 with any 5 Empire characters (ideally Palp lead and Thrawn)
4. BB-8 with 5 FO under KRU lead
5. Chimaera with your rebel fleet

Your ideal arena team for now is Bastila (L), GMY, Anakin, Old Ben +1. Kanan on defense, maybe Qui-Gon on offense.

For your next arena team, I'd suggest either JKR or Padme. Padme works great with JKA, Ahsoka and GMY. All you need to complete the team is GK from the heroic tank raid (join a proper guild as soon as possible). You could initially use Rex to complete the team.

Padme unlocks at 5\*, JKR at 7\*. You already have 2 Separatists for the Padme event, Dooku and Ventress. Farm Nute and 2 others to 5 stars (good to worse choices: B-2, Geo Spy, Poggle, IG-100, Sun Fac, Geo Soldier) and you're ready for the Padme event.

For JKR, you'd have to finish 7-star Bastila and farm Jolee, Mission, Zaalbar and T3 to 7\*. Both teams are great in an early arena, but I think Padme has more long-term potential. JKR is the better raid team though, so you might eventually want to get both.

As for fleet arena, the bundle includes 4 bounty hunters and 3 of their ships. Once you can farm Bossk and his ship, you can prepare for the Chewbacca and Millennium Falcon events. Both are 5\* unlocks. Once you've unlocked Han from the heroic pit raid, it should be easy to climb in fleet arena with Home One. Starting lineup would be Hound's Tooth or Biggs with Falcon and Ghost."

I'm sick and tired of Yes Men like you who bend themselves into pretzels to defend every bug and every fuckup that could have been prevented with a bare minimum of testing. 

Go play devil's advocate in the official forum, where entire hordes of your ilk lie in waiting to pounce on every newbie with a valid complaint. Don't bring this crap to Reddit too. I wouldn't be surprised if even the devs found you annoying because all you do is drive away potential customers."
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ffa761q,t1_ffa491l,1579729201.0,"You need to kill them in a certain order. Old Daka needs to die first since she can revive. But a g11+ Zombie also revives the first two dead Nightsisters, and you can't kill Zombie as long as other NS are left.

This means you want to kill the weakest NS two times. She'll be immediately revived, but then you can finally kill Daka and go after Talzin and Ventress. Zombie constantly gets in the way of course, but you can control her with Bastila's stun / dispel. Ezra's Flourish can dispel her too. Or simply kill her repeatedly to reduce her speed."

The +150% tenacity from her zetaed lead makes it much less likely for plague and stun to stick. Add 200% Protection Up and a healer who can revive the entire rest of the team at once if necessary and you have a pretty decent NS counter.

The only problem for zBastila is Acolyte. You'd have to bring Anakin along for his AOE because GMY's AOE doesn't cut it. Acolyte stealthes and recovers 40% health on a critical hit, so she can hide behind zombie and snipe away at you."

This is not only huge in the arena, it also helps in raids. And since a fast GMY fits perfectly into a Padme team, this zeta is a great long-term investment. I have g13 3PO, R2 and Barriss, but most of the time I find myself using GMY as 5th."

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ff1zim1,t3_er59e6,1579489832.0,"You can earn up to 10 million in the credit heist event but you'll need a scoundrel team to participate. If those scoundrels are smugglers (like Qi'ra and the Solo gang, Raid Han and legendary Chewie, or Vet Han and Chewie), they also qualify for the Smuggler's Run event. But if you're farming bounty hunters for Chewie and the Millennium Falcon you might as well use them instead.

Your second best source of income are raids and other guild events. The higher you score in raids, the more credits you earn. Finishing Galactic War also gives you a nice chunk of money every day.

Then there is mod farming. Farm a ton of mods (only from the highest tier for each mod type) and be very selective with leveling them. Unless they're relatively rare, such as crosses with potency primary, you might want to take them only level 3 so you can still sell them at a profit in case they don't roll a speed seconday. You might even want to sell mods with less than +5 speed and sell all grey mods right away without wasting credits on them."

So once you have 5 Phoenix characters at 5\*, you can unlock 5\* Thrawn and Palp, and with them 5\* R2 if you have 3 more Empire characters who meet the star requirements. They'll also get you a better arena ranking than Phoenix. A 5\* character is perfectly viable with enough gear."
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ff17ckk,t1_fepbn7h,1579475989.0,Yep. Here's an overview with the rest of the requirements: [https://i.imgur.com/cGljHCW.png](https://i.imgur.com/cGljHCW.png)

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fezn5z7,t1_fex0qbk,1579459236.0,"And what do you think kept them from dropping a few hundred $ and dominating before? The top 50 have always been a dolphin and whale club. F2P has been pronounced dead since I started playing over a year ago and people like Ahnaldt scream ""the sky is falling"" for that sweet YT revenue. Now he even has a sponsor in form of a CG competitor."
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,feww6vc,t1_fewt6yh,1579420436.0,"So it was you who hyperbolically exaggerated $200 (!!!) worth of shard packs in addition to the $100 hyperdrive bundle as ""some select purchases"". 

Not that Ahnaldt was entirely honest either. He initially lies that it's possible to get a full g12 team with a zetaed JKR for 300 bucks (note that the hyperdrive bundle only contains 10 zeta mats. Does the JKR event give you another 10? I don't remember it being that many.) Later he admits that he also bought a few gear packs in addition. Must have been quite a few for a full g12 team. I'm guessing the whole team cost him at least $500.

How many players are going to drop that kind of money on day one?
 Like I said, take everything this guy says with a grain of salt. He's in the doomsaying business nowadays in order to promote a different game. Always follow the money."
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fewsxly,t3_eqlwuv,1579419016.0,"You can also take a look at this section of the official forum.

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fews931,t1_fewmo6m,1579418717.0,"That's nonsense. Aside from a 5-star Bastila, you don't get the characters to unlock JKR from the hyperdrive bunde. I'd take Ahnaldt's vids with a grain of salt. You still have to 7-star Bastila AND farm Jolee, Mission, Zaalbar and T3 from scratch. That's not going to happen in under 2 hours.

What you can do right away though is unlock a 5-star GMY, Thrawn, Palp, R2, BB-8, and Chimaera. It also gets you closer to unlocking CLS, JTR, Chewie, and HMF. That's admittedly a huge advantage, but I see no reason to blow it out of proportion. JKR is still months away for anyone who buys this bundle.

PS: It was entirely possible to buy this kind of rapid progress before the bundle, it just wasn't anywhere near as cheap. I know this because I bought a bunch of bundles and gambling packs for OR, Phoenix, and bounty hunters + ships when I discovered this game last year.  And I wasn't the only dwarf whale / large dolphin on my arena shards.

PPS: I've also encountered a few F2P hoarding accounts who already had Han, GK and Traya as well as a bunch of gear in the early arena days. That's still an option for F2Ps."

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,feui3d3,t1_fetif84,1579386742.0,"Biggs, KRU and TFP with Vader on the bench would make a decent fleet on a new shard, but Geos are a better option these days under Executrix lead. Of course you can still use ITF as a reinforcement."
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,feug8ok,t1_fetm2mm,1579386232.0,"I'd also say Jolee since you need him for JKR anyway. Hermit Yoda is great to have in raids, but he's not part of the ideal JKR lineup (JKR, Bast, GMY, Jolee, GK) and he requires GET1 tokens, which are also needed to star up Malak and GAS at some point. You might be better off hoarding your two guild events currencies."
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,feu3kpq,t3_eqdc4h,1579382770.0,Do it if you're going to use Home One in fleet for the forseeable future. But I wouldn't g13 him if you're close to unlocking Negotiator or Malevolence.

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,femkq6u,t1_femh751,1579260434.0,"JKR lead, Bastila lead, GK lead, GMY lead, Zarriss lead, I've even used OB lead in this event out of boredom. Relics make it way too easy.
