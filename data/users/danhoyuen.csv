They are both HoFers but it's not far fetch to think Lowry deserves a earlier spot due to his ring. 

Again, Paul had one of the all time greatest offensive player in harden who was a legit MVP level player.  If they had beaten GSW (without Durant)  we would be singing a different tune to who had a historical stacked team (floor General ever + most explosive scorer in history in the league) and how winning the ship was only a forgone conclusion.  We shouldnt penalize Lowry's achievement because he ended up succeeding where Paul has failed."

Each of the emperors have a reason to help each other against the marines since they could be the next target from a focused attack. 
The seven warlord system was to ensure that peace could be kept on the open seas, without having to mobilize the admirals since their presence is needed to guard strategic locations.

They are both starting point guard and a floor general on their respective teams so I think judging them based on result is pretty reasonable.

Let's not forget Lowry himself is also part of that all time defensive team.  You put Chris Paul on the 2019 raptors there's no guarantee that he can replicate the success.

Chris Paul had some tandems that were no slouch over the years too. If they HAD reached the finals we would be calling his team stacked too with Blake and DeAndre.  But the fact of the matter is CP kept coming up short and there's gotta be a penalty for that."

nba,felog0a,t1_fejm2ud,1579227050.0,"It's not the same though.  WNBA has been around for more than 2 decades and there's no evidence that it has increased any intrigue for the basketball within the female community.  It hasn't even gained traction with it's target audience even with the help of modern social media machine and a massively successful nba backing and running campaign for it.

At some point you just have to dial back and reassess the strategy and see if what they've been doing is working towards their intended goal.  If it's to grow basketball as a sport by encouraging females to enjoy it, it has failed miserably.  There are alternatives programs such as hosting girl basketball camps that foster real genuine love and appreciation for the game:  It's far more productive to do that than to sell a dream to little girls that they can become millionaire athletes because people want to watch them play.  If the goal is for the league to make money, it has failed spectacularly.
