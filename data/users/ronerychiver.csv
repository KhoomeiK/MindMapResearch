depression,fecr5gg,t3_eod6s0,1578981528.0,"You could fall off a rock and die or you could stay at home and fall off the couch and die. I’m proud of you for getting out there and doing something. People don’t realize that getting out and actually DOING something is very hard but it’s an important step in the right direction. You didn’t climb all the way to the top in one single lunge. It took time, energy, some stress, and probably in some occasions thinking you found the perfect route and then realizing you needed to backtrack to find another way. That’s okay. You’re still climbing and still working m your way upwards. Life is no different. You will think you’ve got the perfect route set and then realize you fucked yo and have to find a new route. Don’t let go and plummet. Backtrack, find a new route and keep moving upward. You’ve already proven you can hang in by your fingertips and keep moving upward. Keep pushing yourself not only in the climb but in your reach outside of your comfort zone. You’re not alone in what you feel. There are so many others struggling with the same problems that have manifested themselves in a multitude of ways. Keep climbing."

depression,fecqitk,t3_eo9v2a,1578980926.0,"What I recommend is not to look at your therapist as your friend (which they aren’t there to be) but as an objective observer. The thing you don’t like about them may be that they don’t have any vested stake in you because you pay them but what they provide is an asset. They have nothing to Lise by telling you the truth in what they see. Sometimes the truth they see is hard to accept and it can challenge your view of yourself but your therapist should be providing you with insight that makes you happier with yourself and makes you see yourself in a better light. If they aren’t doing that, fire them and find someone else. If all they do is take notes and ask you “how does that make you feel?”, they might not be worth your time. But when you find the right one that you trust with your feelings and who is giving you the tools to find happiness within yourself and to find it around you, stick with them and use them. They can’t be the person who gets drinks with you after a long day, but the right one can help you find the tools to build a network on your own. You’re not alone in your fight, friend. The hardest part of being sad is that you feel like you’re the only one that is. You’re not. We’re here with you."

Yes, smart would dictate that you not work on a live outlet but as tide pods have shown us, you should plan to the lowest common denominator of idiot."
coolguides,fe4k16b,t1_fe3j8bz,1578860169.0,The piece that gets me is using a flathead screw on the cover plate. The tool you are require to use on the outlet is the same shape as the hole that contains the death part.

Their generation is pretty set in their ways but I’m glad there are some great exceptions to their rule like your new dad who accepts and shows the love you and everyone deserves from a parent. I can say that under this president, I’ve seen a lot more of people’s true colors. When someone in charge demeans others and demonstrates that it’s okay to think a group of people is below you, you start seeing the hate and feelings that people have been harboring. I hope that this exposure leaves a lasting impact on our generation and leads more of us to raise families and children that include everyone and make no one feel like less.
