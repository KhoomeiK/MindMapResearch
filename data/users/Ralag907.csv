Someone who works hard and falls, you can bet your britches there's a number of good folk who would give thier shirt off thier backs if it helps the person back to workin or at least not being a burden. I can only generalize.

But as I've got older I've worked a long time. Sometimes not hard, sometimes not smart, but I've gained respect for anyone who works/volunteers. 

Watching some of my tax dollars fuel enabling addictions for fully able bodies without kids is nuts. Sex/gender aside, if you don't work and I perceive it's a choice then my opinion changes. Obviously case by case, but I can understand why a rural worker would have disdain for an urbanite who slums around on the dole. I know plenty who do. If I could kick them off them the rolls I would. They won't even spend 2 hours/week at then food bank/pantry and help everyone, including themselves, yet demand money and services."
