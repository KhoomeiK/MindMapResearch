But its other people that are going to miss ya when youre gone. Was a former smoker myself, and after seeing what it does to my mom and everyone around me, i realized its not worth it."
RedDeadOnline,fef2r2d,t3_eopif1,1579046805.0,"If this is how you feel, then i would recommend quitting the game for now. Dont torture yourself. I quit for all these reasons, dont regret it. I want to come back but these bugs just ruin it for me. I still check the sub cuz the community is great, but my streak wasnt worth keeping. Maybe if enough people feel like its not worth playing in its current state, then player count will drop and rockstar might finally decide fixing this crap."

Dogfree,fdnpide,t3_em3h04,1578590442.0,"Retractable leash advocate and proud long tine dog owner here. Idk what retractable leashes you guys are referring to but i had no problems using this one i had from the 90's and still have coupled with a no choke harness. it locks so i can keep her at the distance i choose like a normal leash. I can pull on the wire if needed without ""cutting my hands"". Has a good grip havent dropped it yet. And yes she thinks she owns the trail and will bark at whoever she sees so i have to watch out for other people pull her aside, get down on one knee and restrain her and let people walk by. Never once have i had a problem with it. If you buy a chinsy one of course youre gonna have problems. Dont let dumb dog owners make up your mind over a product you will never use. Just popped over here from a dif sub to see if this sub actually existed, ill be leaving now. And i tried to be as respectful as possible so i would appreciate the same, even if you disagree with me. Just stating my experience."

OldSchoolCool,fdm2t5l,t1_fdlqdzs,1578538458.0,I mean atleast he was more or less honest and didnt rape women (tht we know of lol) but he bit the heads off of animals? (Correct me if im wrong) wouldnt exactly call that good. But thats my opinion as an animal lover.

RedDeadOnline,fdkoxln,t1_fdkoniz,1578508109.0,Yeah i can understand that. I get frustrated when i try the moonshiner role and get bugged to hell so i dont even bother. It is kinda sad tho that camps arent even fixed and its been a prob since beta.
RedDeadOnline,fdko3pn,t3_elrukm,1578507609.0,"While i may be annoyed at some of the bugs, i still need my gold bars. Ill be damned if i lose my streak. The game will be fixed... Eventually. Just need patience.  If you feel that strongly, play something else. I just log on do my dailies then im out."

reddeadredemption2,fdjhibj,t1_fdjhb9x,1578471050.0,"I know. But they werent common, especially for people to own back then. most were wild like u said since they were abandoned by the army. So if everyone was riding into valentine on a camel,  people would feel like its immersion breaking, which was what i was getting at."
reddeadredemption2,fdjeh21,t3_elkvcz,1578467411.0,Would love one but people would complain about immersion breakin. I would also be all for a camel but sadly prob never gonna happen :(
RedDeadOnline,fdivp0i,t3_eli4mh,1578452095.0,"In my experience this is my opinion on the state of the game: infinite loading screens happen a lot for me, mostly with moonshiner which sucks cuz i want to progress through it but have given up since its broken imo. Animals never spawn for me so have given up on that. Bounty hunter never pays out but whatever since i maxed it out on those rare occasions. Camps feel a little better but still a 50/50 but can occasionally load into a lobby with my camp already set. All in all i love the game but just doing my dailies and waiting for them to get their shit together, plenty of other games out there to play."

RedDeadOnline,fdf1sqj,t3_ekwp5v,1578351364.0,"Reminds me of an interaction i just had with some guy. I was at the butcher selling some feathers for the daily, and right on cue i get shot in the head trying to get to the fast travel. So i kill him a few times with explosive ammo. Go to my moonshine bar for more dailies. Then come back to blackwater. That guys still there. So he sees me and tries to kill me again so i riddle him with more explosive bullets. Then another posse just comes out of nowhere and one catches me off guard with a lasso and ties me up. Then i see the guy from earlier come running up thinking hes gonna finish me off. Nope, he blasts the guy away, and proceeds to untie me. We emoted eachother and became homies. We carried on to wreck the posse who kept on coming at us, but we held our own. Then to my suprise, i get disconnected from the server due to a fault in rockstars services or whatever. One of my favorite player interactions. We went from enemies to bros that had each other's backs. If you are out there, know that you have earned my respect."

funny,fcdouy0,t1_fcd8m1c,1577612112.0,"Also had lots of dogs and, I mean idk if thats true, chihuahuas are way harder to train since they are really small brained,imbred, pigmy animals, compared to any big dog. But by no means impossible, i have a chi'weenie that is the sweetest thing just takes more time but i can think of lots of smarter dog breeds that are easier to deal with. But i agree most of the issues lie with the owner not the dog breed."
funny,fcdmluk,t1_fcbzjil,1577611472.0,Exactly chihuahuas are never trained properly because they are so small and people think they cant cause damage
