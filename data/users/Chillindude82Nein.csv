PhonesAreBad,ferncz0,t3_eqesg9,1579356076.0,I work with a few people that have 12-15 year old kids. I've seen the video recordings from their in-home security cameras. Their kids DO act like this when the phone is taken away. Makes me not want to have kids.

aww,fd88ppt,t1_fd6ftgq,1578215301.0,Can you explain your process of putting the pup into timeout for this? Did you scold her and then put her in the kennel as soon as she got too rough?

halo,fbgu3g8,t1_fbg53cy,1576858615.0,"5:55+ doesn't seem nitpicky to me. In old graphics, there's green dripping acid that is very visible (the first time you encounter this ever). In new graphics, it is VERY unlikely you'd see the green acid dripping. The video continues on to show things like this that are massive changes to the atmosphere. I'm not saying either way is better than the other, but I am saying that they are very different in every way - physically, spiritually, and mentally. 

You did not watch much of the video, or you're trying to spread lies."
