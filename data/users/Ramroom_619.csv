selfimprovement,ffajld6,t3_es9623,1579737345.0,"Dont start with high-jump gaols ( ex 0 programming practice to suddenly 3h per day ) . Doing this will make it harder for you to achieve your goals , and failure at this point might be very demotivating for you.  Start with small goals and increase gradually ( just as you mentioned increasing running distance every two weeks ) .

Also , try not to tackle all these challenges at the same time . Start month #1 with one of your goals , and only add goal no#2 after you've successfully been doing goal#1 for a month . 

You want to give yourself the time and energy to calibrate to these changes . Take it easy . Dont let your excitement and motivation be the cause of your early burnout ."
