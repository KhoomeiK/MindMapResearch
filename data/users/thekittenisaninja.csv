The cause of death has not been released to the public, but long hours, work-life balance, and how to cope with stress have all come up as major concerns.

Have her pick out something for dinner that she can prepare herself, get her a movie, or let her have unlimited screen time while you're out. We sometimes bring SD home a dessert from the restaurant. You can make it a win/win!"
stepparents,ff8eyv0,t1_ff7lv7p,1579675610.0,">Everything shouldn't be just catering to the kids, making them the center of attention.

I couldn't agree with you more. I have so many friends who run themselves ragged keeping up with their kid's social calendars, I watch their marriages grow stale because the relationship is no longer a priority, and then they wonder why their overly entitled kids are literally unbearable to be around, acting out every time they don't get their way.

I wonder if it's a natural reaction for the generation of ""latchkey kids"" who grew up without parents who did those sorts of things, and a genuine desire to want to be the parents they didn't have? And then of course it's reinforced through social media."
stepparents,ff8dtkn,t3_es1kqk,1579674324.0,"Oh my gosh I remember those days. 24/7 and no help whatsoever from BM, no family to help out either. We couldn't afford a sitter. My SO and I used to pretend our grocery shopping trips were our ""dates."" 

Hang in there, it totally gets better! It really depends on their maturity and everyone's comfort level, but honestly, there's a point where they prefer not to be tagging along and doing their own thing. Age 14 was about where we started feeling ok about going out on dates, short ones at first but gradually longer. Around 16 was when we felt ok letting them stay home while we were were out overnight (but close by, just in case). Once they start driving... well, you'll hardly see them lol. 

Our youngest is 17 now. We'll usually ask her if she wants to join us, and most often she says no. Sometimes she comes, and it's actually nice, because we really don't get to spend a lot of time together anymore! Funny how things change. :)"

For the next try, I chose to tackle one issue at a time, starting with the worst behavior. I kept enforcing it, and after a both or so, it became “normal” for the kids. Then I’d move onto the next issue. Turned out to be a much better solution that nagging about everything all the time, which would have driven everyone crazy, myself included."

Restaurant_Managers,fecso3w,t3_eoeytl,1578983102.0,"This is a lot of red flags, and even though I’m marketing/design these days vs hands on in the restaurant, your post made me concerned for you.

A few years ago I needed a job and I took one, knowing full well that many other high level designers I’d worked with in the past had gone in, and quit on bad terms. And then I figured out why. That churn & burn mentality from the top down is impossible to deal with, and staying too long will only burn you out, fast.

I’d question the interests of the company, starting at the top. Was the last KM not really choosing her battles, or was she saying no to an environment that wasn’t supporting? Were they stifling her, instead of allowing her to grow? And even more importantly, will they do the same to you? That should be an easy answer, based on how you see them treat other employees.

V-day is rough. Take care of yourself, do what you can but don’t let yourself be pushed into burnout. It might be a good move to look at other options and seek out a place that values what their employees bring to the table.

As a side note, from the marketing/design side, one month is plenty of time to roll out a campaign. LOL, we usually only get a week’s notice, sometimes 8 hours!"

stepkids,feck5k3,t1_fe6m19h,1578975883.0,"I think these are great insights, and something should be talked about a lot more. 

Something also important that I've been noticing is that most kids - for whatever reason - don't feel comfortable going to their parents and saying ""hey, I don't like this custody schedule"" or ""hey, it really hurts my feelings when you refer to the baby our baby."" I know I didn't talk with my parents about stuff like until much later in life. So many posts here seem like the kids are suffering in silence, and they really need an opportunity to state their feelings and at least to be heard.

And OMG, I'm so glad for you that you're in a country with a better, smarter system. That seems so much more attainable than what we've got going on here!"
stepparents,fecfo2f,t1_fec1xyl,1578972787.0,"Hugs hugs hugs!!! 

If I could do it all over, I think I'd tell myself to learn to chill out more. There was so much I wanted to pack into raising them, and I didn't get a lot of years to do it. I needed to remind myself constantly that it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. Let go, enjoy the moments, don't forget to have fun.

stepparents,fecenc9,t1_fe8lzi2,1578972103.0,"You know what??? You are absolutely right about that, and I'm blinking away tears right now. I'm so damn proud of them, and that's all I ever wanted out of this.

Thinking back to 8 years ago, my dear friend and mother figure pulled me aside, and told me that I needed to take them in and raise them properly or they'd end up pregnant high school dropouts without a future. She wasn't wrong about that, the oldest was literally almost there when we took over custody. She had straight F's, wanted to drop out of middle school, and was sleeping with every boy she could get her hands on while her BM didn't even have her on birth control.

There were some really dark times, when it seemed like there was no way that one lowly step parent could possibly achieve moving the needle so far. The beautiful thing is that it was the kids themselves who decided what sort of people they wanted to be, began setting their own goals for their lives, and started working towards them. I like to think that I showed them the path to some of the doors, but they were the ones who had to decide to open them, and step through. I'm so proud of them for making that leap.  :)"

So... the kids were 8, 10 and 12 when I met them.  It's been 8 years now, 7 of which were full custody, like 24/7 full custody.

Pick just ONE issue??? LMAO!!! :) :) :)

Well, the one I'd say was directly on me was my relationship with the middle girl. She and I were like oil and water. Her sisters had tons of redeeming qualities, but this poor girl got the short end of that stick, and it was very tough most days to bury my feelings and continue to be kind while she was giving me attitude. And let's be honest, kids can see through that act, ya know? I tried my damn best to teach her empathy, but that's just not how her brain is wired, and I think those lessons became more reasons to believe that  ""I hated her."" Eventually it culminated with accusations of abuse, and that was my final breaking point. She moved in with BM, and ... get this ... BM kicked her out within a month and called my SO to apologize! I felt somewhat justified afterwards, when her own BM couldn't handle her for more than 30 days while I'd managed 7 YEARS. But BM's incapabilities were also the main reason I agreed to take all this on in the first place.

So... there was some serious tough love involved at that point. She was 18 after all. We let her do her thing, wearing out her welcome at one place after another (while keeping tabs enough to know that she was safe, but letting her learn some real life lessons at the same time). It truly did her some good. She's learned that playing the victim card only gets you so far, when even her own family began standing up for me. She's learned to let go of the spoiled princess mentality, to stop expecting things to be handed to her and start working for them. She and her boyfriend have their own place now, and best of all, she and I have cleared the air and moved on to a new phase of our relationship. She's taken the responsibility for her life, and I can finally just be supportive and an ear if she wants to talk about stuff. It's best for both of us.

Just to add... I know their relationship sounds rather 1950's, but in a weird way it's actually perfect for the two of them. They both went to a community college type of high school, and are already working in their field. I was honestly concerned that she would have a hard time finding a guy given her issues, but they've been an item now for 3 years, he's incredibly responsible for his age and devoted to her ... so c'est la vie say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell!!!"

There will be many women in her life, who offer guidance, nurturing, companionship, mentoring... and you are the first, outside her mother, who offered those things. 

It's heartbreaking to see her hurting, but her heartbreak is only the first of many, and she'll need to learn how to be strong, how to cope, how to deal with the hurt without hurting herself. And she turned to you.

I think she's a smart girl, and has made a good decision. There are things that can't be fixed, but with the right people, it's possible to move past them. I'm so glad that she has you."

WTF!!! Where is your dad??? Is him being away a temporary thing or is it ongoing???

Seeing a bit more of your story makes me think that this is not only a bad situation for you and your brother, but it's not great for your stepmom and step siblings either. It doesn't seem like any of you were really ready to be on your own without him. 

In my other comment, I urged you to talk with your dad about the situation. Please do. I really hope this is just temporary, and doesn't do too much damage to your relationship with the step side of your family. But really, I have to say it's an awful lot to deal with. Hugs. I'll be thinking of you, and hoping that it gets better."
stepkids,fe6eguk,t3_egl0j3,1578888495.0,"I want to start off by giving you a huge hug. Good on you for taking on the responsibilities of raising your little brother, I can already tell you have a big heart for being willing to do it. 

The other thing I want to say is this: it shouldn't be your responsibility. One of your parents is slipping, and letting that duty fall on your shoulders. That's not fair to you. Your main responsibility right now should be you, looking after yourself, figuring out what you want from life, working towards that goal but having fun meanwhile, basically getting yourself on a path to where you want to be. That's honestly a lot to figure out, and it can be overwhelming on its own. Adding the responsibility of raising a sibling takes you away from what you should be focusing on. But all that said, it still says a lot about your heart and your personality that you're willing to do it. And I can totally see where you know in your heart that you can do it better than any step parent. After all, you've known him longer and better than your step.

I also agree with you that discipling should not be something the stepparent has to do. They're just getting to know you, and just building the relationship. Ideally, it should be the bio parent who does the disciplining. But sometimes that just doesn't work out if the bio parent isn't home. Or if that bio parent isn't doing the parenting that they should be doing.

I think you should sit down with your dad and talk to him about your concerns. It's not fair to put the burden of raising your brother on your shoulders, and then \*snap\* take it away because the stepparent is there. It deserves a conversation, at least. 

If you do find the strength to have that conversation, please come back, make a new post, and let us know how it went. And don't forget, you've got our support!"
stepkids,fe6c83e,t1_fe1f7pw,1578886745.0,"I'm from the US, and tuition has quadrupled since I put myself through college about 15 years ago, and it was nearly impossible back then. I literally don't see how any young adult could be expected to cover the cost on their own these days, especially when they're just starting out. It's insane.

But back to your convo, I want to ask ... is EOWE (every other weekend) the issue, and would you have preferred  dividing the time more equally so you were at each parent's house a few days per week? Or is it more about the complications that arise when a bio and step parent have a child together?"
stepkids,fe6bkz4,t1_fe65omy,1578886267.0,"That's actually a thing! It's called [birdnesting](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/birdnesting-gives-kids-one-stable-home-after-divorce-does-it-ncna935336). Interesting idea, but I feel like it'd be really hard to implement unless the parents lived/worked close by, and were on good terms. I can def see that it would be a helpful transition, for the kid's sake.

Honestly - just about any situation could work IF the parents can suck it up and deal for the sake of the kids. After years of following r/stepparents, it's really clear that the majority of the issues aren't actually steps vs. kids. It's when the bio parents can't get along, and when the steps get drawn into the drama."
stepkids,fe0ws0f,t3_enhrlj,1578819658.0,"Honestly... I wish I'd had something as ""normal"" as EOWE. My dad left, and that was it.

I understand WHY my dad took another job, in another state. We were living just barely above - or more likely, below -poverty level, and it was a huge promotion. Imagine trying to support a family of 5 on $25k per year, when you could take that leap and make $50k instead?

And then, much much later in life, I realized that the $65k I was contributing to my stepfamily wasn't nearly enough to cover cars and tuition. I didn't leave physically, but I definitely left emotionally, in order to double my income and afford things like cars and college tuition. Just like any man who made that sacrifice in previous generations, I lost time with family, loved ones, friends... in order to be a better provider.

Regardless of gender, and generations, I think there's a responsibility that parents take on as they must, to ensure their families are provided for. We're not at a place yet where men can take a day off to spend with their sick kid without being made to feel emasculated, and we're not at a place where women can take off either, lest they risk being incapable of having a place in the workforce. 

Unless you're a complete POS parent, you want to be with your kid, but you also know what needs to be do to continue providing for them. And in this world, providing takes precedence over emotion. I wish it didn't need to be that way.

Now... if money is no issue, and the parent just wants to move on... that's an entirely different issue. But then again, just to be the devil's advocate, there may be undisclosed financial issues.

Either way, it sucks."

stepparents,fb7zs8f,t3_ebycle,1576603022.0,"I really feel for you. Being financially responsible for another adult AND their child is completely unacceptable, and nothing you should have to deal with. Trying to be the responsible stepparent when both biological parents refuse to do so is a recipe for disaster. Adding alcoholism into the mix tips the scales so far in my opinion that I'd seriously question the benefits of staying in this relationship.

Alcoholism may be a disease, but that doesn't mean you need to subject yourself to being in a relationship with an alcoholic. Stepparenting is tough enough without the added problems of alcoholism, and the lack of emotional connection that it causes. If and when you reach a point where you decide this isn't for you, it is 100% ok to get out.

If you're intent on staying, ABSOLUTELY get into counseling, and ABSOLUTELY discuss his drinking. Your counselor is going to take it very seriously, and it will likely be the main issue to be resolved before any others. At the very least, it sounds like he's willing to try counseling (many people would simply refuse) so that's a tiny win. But you'll need to see real results and accountability if you're going to stay. 

You're loving and compassionate toward your partner and his daughter. Don't forget that you also deserve the same!"
