We started talking.

Right away we were able to share how jolting it is to return to America and realize how different the emotional atmosphere is here. You don’t know till you’ve lived abroad, how harsh and vulgar and cold Americans really are. People in other cultures are warmer and kinder and more empathetic than we are. We both felt more relaxed, cheerful, and safe where we were!"
