People boil steak?!??!!?"
movies,ff1hkew,t1_ff1501b,1579479339.0,"Wow. Hating an actress suddenly gives me balls?

If I tell you I hate a male actor will it give me my vagina back?

I said nothing about the character, just that I don‚Äôt like the actress and that I would have liked the movie better with a different lead.  I still saw it in the theater and bought the dvd when it came out. 

You obviously made a lot of assumptions about who I am (you people? Seriously?) and why I don‚Äôt like her, but the reason I hate her is simple. 

Her acting sucks. 
If I wanted to watch flat wooden actors I‚Äôd watch Twilight 

It has NOTHING to do with her gender or how vocal she is about equality or that she starred in a Marvel movie or whatever it is that fanboys have been hating her for."
movies,ff13vap,t1_ff12go1,1579474951.0,"Or they just legit hate the actress. 

Captain Marvel was a good movie, but would have been 500% better with a different actress 

I hated the actress before the movie and hate her just as much after."

We were concerned about our fertility so we went to a doctor and it was confirmed that we are unable to have kids.

We wanted to make sure we couldn‚Äôt have kids so we got the snip and confirmed zero sperm count."

AmItheAsshole,fehfsh2,t3_ep4c3n,1579115640.0,"NTA. I completely understand your aversion to being there. 

Honestly, I would just say fine and then be ‚Äúsick‚Äù when the time comes. Just tell the nurse/doctor that you‚Äôve had XYZ symptoms in the last couple days and want to make sure you‚Äôre not a danger to you sister/baby.  You will be barred so fast... You‚Äôll, of course, be barred from seeing the baby for some time because you‚Äôre ‚Äúsick‚Äù, so you‚Äôll have to decide if it‚Äôs worth it to you. 

 Yes, it is an asshole move to lie, but I have zero problems lying when it comes to keeping the peace.  Plus it‚Äôs probably better than OP puking or passing out in the hospital room."

AmItheAsshole,fdrpmbt,t3_emv42p,1578687788.0,"NTA - it‚Äôs fair that they want you to pay your own insurance but the gas, maintenance etc should be split depending on how much the car is used for you vs your family especially if it‚Äôs not going to be YOUR car. 

You should try to negotiate with your parents, maybe see if you can keep a mileage log and use that to track the % that you should be responsible for. If you wanted to be even more difficult you could calculate what the Uber fare would be and charge them a % of that."

I didn‚Äôt contact them since I was able to cut around the spot. 

I ordered the polyester dupioni from FwD for a robe √† la fran√ßaise for cosplay and it‚Äôs great. When I make my real one I‚Äôll use actual silk, probably from silk baron because they have a better color selection."

Fabric clips instead of pins, especially for fabric that will show pin holes

Rotary cutter (and cutting mat) is life changing, you‚Äôll still need scissors, but the rotary cutter makes cutting so easy. Just be careful because they‚Äôre ridiculously sharp.
