Anxiety,ffewex8,t3_et1xah,1579868321.0,"Yep my anxiety is thankfully low these days but I was over at a co workers house and her daughter came home and she started yelling at her. It set off my anxiety. 

I’d never been to my co workers house or met the daughter before so not only was it rude to yell at someone in front of a guest it really triggered me because I grew up in an abusive household and it reminded me of my childhood."

AskWomen,ffanzb8,t1_ffagj2s,1579740423.0,"It’s hard. This break up wasn’t my fault it was his issues and he ruined it, but my brain keeps wanting to blame myself for it. 

Sorry about your divorce. End of relationships are hard"
AskWomen,ffaa3bq,t1_ff9eb6g,1579730845.0,"I think once you’ve been incredibly sick your life changes. I don’t know if you’ll ever be the same again. It has set me on a different path. The path is very unknown and unpredictable which makes things incredibly hard. 

If I was to be brutally honest my life wasn’t so great before I got sick. Getting sick and the aftermath brought a lot of things to the surface. Things I never realised. For example my parents are both pretty awful people. I was looking at being homeless and when asked for help had them both turn their back on me. Or getting screamed at I was just lazy for not working while still trying to recover. So dealing with that was and still is very hard. 

Feeling lost I think is probably a normal thing when dealing with being very sick. It changes you. You can’t do things that you were once able to. If you are sick and can’t work and have little money it really makes life hard. There is also the recovery process too. It’s slow. I’m fumbling along at life which is quite different from having a solid plan and trying to hit certain goals, I can’t do what I used to and when your life dramatically changes you lose who you were and you are set on another path so you have to find the new you which I think can be hard and confusing"

AskWomen,ff8q0l0,t1_ff8puyj,1579691172.0,It’s very hard not to get bitter about getting sick and the direction my life has taken.  I think it really stings to see people achieving milestones because if you are still sick then it feels like you will never achieve them yourself. Like you I’m not jealous it’s more the sadness of how things have turned out for me and probably I’m scared I’ll never be able to achieve the things I so desperately want.

I on the other hand I almost died I was so sick lost everything ( job, bf, life savings, mental health, family, lost the ability to have children, was looking at being homeless and no support off parents so literally had to do this on my own) while I went through numerous operations and recoveries. Lost years of my life while being sick and still not better. I finally though I was getting my life back when my new bf dumped me a few weeks ago. What a cruel joke my life is. 

My friend and I went out for coffee and she was excitedly talking about her up coming wedding and her jobs and having kids and going overseas again. All I could do was cry and tell her I’m so sorry I can’t deal with her talking about her wedding right now and that I’m sorry I’m not being a supportive friend atm.

I’m having to now try and undo a lot of damage they put on me years and years later. There are so things which I felt like I should have accomplished by now and truth be told I’m scared I’ll never accomplish because I’m trying to learn things I should have experienced years ago.

mentalhealth,ff5ccn4,t3_eroy3c,1579587097.0,Having imaginary friends as a child shows a child has a great imagination. I had a rough childhood and I had imaginary friends to probably help me cope and be less lonely. They don’t do anything but help me in life so I’m not concerned. Occasionally I still make up friends when I’m going through a rough patch to help talk my feeling out to or to keep me company when I’m lonely. They are the same ones I had as a child though. I sometimes feel a bit embarrassed since I’m an older adult but no one knows about it and if they help me though a rough patch then I don’t think there is anything wrong with that
CPTSD,ff56099,t3_erkcyr,1579581211.0,They say that because it passes the blame onto their parents and not on them. They take zero responsibility for their actions. They also get to play the victim because they got treated badly too.

AnxietyDepression,ff2v7r1,t3_erb7xl,1579525453.0,"Sounds like anxiety. The best way I have heard what you feel described is that your body has a fear reaction that’s not working properly

If you see a snake you feel fear which keeps you safe. Your fear response is switched on but there is no snake or danger so because you feel danger when you look around everything feels dangerous when in fact it’s not. 

Best thing to do is to keep pushing and go out. It’s next to impossible I know but firstly the more you avoid going out the more you fear it so going out becomes more scarier than it really is. Avoidance makes the fear bigger! Secondly when you try and go out keep telling yourself there is nothing to be afraid of it’s just your brain is giving you the wrong feelings"

datingoverforty,fevtqr1,t1_fevpgoq,1579401384.0,"Some have personality disorders I agree but others are actually lovely people. Unfortunately they had terrible childhoods usually abusive or very neglectful. so they think themselves as unlovable and they keep their hearts locked down for fear of getting close to people and being let down or abandoned. falling in love or being intimate will set off their fears so they run when they are getting close to someone. This is how they have kept themselves safe as a child. So they can be lovely people but sadly have this huge flaw and run away from people they have feelings for.  It gets triggered by having feelings for someone. They want to be loved but there is too much fear. And yes I can bleed into lots of parts of their life as this is also wrapped about having very low self esteem and self worth.

CPTSD,fcls1ds,t1_fck05co,1577755067.0,"Yeah it hurts when someone hurts you. Worse for us because I feel c ptsd people probably have attachment issues and abandonment issues. I think it takes us a lot to let people in and when we do it means a lot to us then when they leave it hurts because we are very selective who we let in.  
Then the circle starts again because we clamp our hearts down. I don’t know what the answer is to make it easier, maybe the more we do it the less scary it becomes and each time we know that no matter how much it hurts we survive. 
Also we got to look out who we let into our lives too. No people with red flags  or are bad for us. We got to take a bit of personal responsibility when things don’t work out too."
