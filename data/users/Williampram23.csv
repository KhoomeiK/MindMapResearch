I've been diagnosed since I was 8 and truly did struggle all through put school up until now. However, you can't brush this off just because I said that. There a numerous mental health issues that causes people to lose focus and from what you've describes it may be a depression issue. Please seek a mental health professional. Even as someone with adhd, ocd and anxiety I am not qualified to diagnose you because at times I struggle to understand myself.


The only advice I could give you is exercise, exercise and exercise. I may not be an expert in psychology but I do know a lot about physiology, health and fitness. Seratonin is one of those hormones that researchers say it is linked to depression. Not enough of it can lead you to feeling down and shit. That's why stuff like zoloft are known chemically as sertraline which is a seratonin blocker (blocks seratonin from being absorbed into the nervous system). Exercise is a good way to regulate that seratonin."

AskReddit,ff8unb0,t3_es53p0,1579696671.0,"It's mostly the ""unwillingness"" to express themselves... they usually go along with what everyone says or try to down play themselves because they have a geeky hobby. Just tell us that you like pokemon already... I love that shit too. They may also take the.selves/situations too seriously, cracking a joke is non-existing, laughing at themselves doesn't exist in their brain.

Having said that ""boringness"" can easily be fixed and it's not something that you were born with. Everyone has the ability to be fun. Also sometimes boring is a good thing, too much fun can be annoying."
Fitness,fexvten,t3_equx3z,1579437281.0,"Lactose intolerance? I don't take whey, but I control my diet really well. I think you should look into creatine as your main supplement and that's all you really need. If you have your diet together then whey isn't as important for your gains. Creatine is harder to come by even in a healthy diet and it helps you to get the most out of your work-out.

So if you're curious (leaving out dairy):

 Breakfast: usually eggs 2 white and 1 whole, some lean meat (I live in asia but beef jerky is a good substitute).

Snack: fruits, nuts

Lunch: pork loin, string beans and sweet potato mash.

Snack: kind of the same

Dinner: kind of the same as lunch but maybe fish instead of pork.

And I'll take creatine as recommended on the box/tub"

unpopularopinion,fejav4w,t1_fej6i5t,1579164711.0,"Don't get me wrong here, not that they aren't great athletes. They are world class athletes for a reason. I'm not sure how to explain it myself but when I see someone perform a spinning back kick or running through random obstacles, you get the ""wow"" feeling that I don't get when someone jumps high or throws far. The combination of speed, accuracy, flexibility, power together is amazing. For the athletes themselves, sure they're out there, seratonin rush and they feel good, but sitting at home I don't see how people running around with a ball or hitting a ball is fun compared to a guy who is climbing up a mountain with no safety rope or two people just beating the shit out of each other with techniques from different disciplines or a guy who parkoured around a building while somebody else is chasing him."

atheism,feg48lg,t3_eh8a0p,1579076196.0,"I'm not sure if you're going to see this but it's the same as all the other religion that existed and now gone. We are flawed human, and our ideas and belief is very replacable over time. One of our creation that had been replaced over and over and over again is religion. Gods of the past is now catagorised as mythologies. Stories from the past from ancient greece resembles the stories in the bible or quran on a way.

Number 2. Religious delusion is now a mental disorder. Not back then. We as humans don't have a very good track record of being mentally stable, even if it's very slight everyone has their mental flaws. If we place someone with schitzophrenia back when jesus was around or muhammad was around, he may be diagnosed as a prophet instead.

Lastly, the argument of 2 billion people believing in one religion. Back then, they would have been converted by force and then over generations they grow in number. God didn't put the bible or quran in their hand, but it was a sword on their throat"" believe in our religion or die"" situation. Countries that were taken over would have also been ruled under religious laws and that includes religious education."

Fitness,fdgblvz,t3_el3b8q,1578388776.0,"I started off solo, and I did it at odd hours for a long while... early in the morning, 11pm, noon. If that makes you feel a little better. No one starts off good, so you mininise your fears and slowly work your way up from there. If it gets you to the gym, then you've one most of it. I used to freak myself out going to the gym and see all these big dudes lifting heavy as fuck with 6 packs and massive biceps. I don't care anymore, even if I am physically smaller. I just do my own thing, I have my own goals so after you get to your intermediate level it will become easier to work at busy hours. Trust me.

Focus on getting your form right and you'll be fine. If it makes you feel better, there will be several classes at the gym, or you can try something completely different like muaythai. Working out in a group helps ease the tension quite a bit."
selfimprovement,fdfdbpq,t1_fde76oj,1578359019.0,"Nah. No voices in my head, paranoia... probably but the thing is when I'm out and about, I chat with people, I chat with strangers and it was completely fine. It's just that blank expression before the smile the gave me the creeps. He could be lonely but more often than not if I do that I wouldn't get it."
selfimprovement,fddu6xe,t1_fddolty,1578324076.0,"I guess you're right it was probably all in my head. Thay doesn't mean the smile wasn't genuine, I do have issues with anxiety already in the first place. I feel kind of bad for acting the way I did now. In that moment though it was very tense and uncomfortable thing because I've never had that reaction before and it caught me off guard. Explaining it like this you wouldn't know my situation but yes I have anxiety issues and yes, you may be right.

That's the whole point I'm on this sub is to be nicer to people and possibly my social calibration isn't as on point."

AskReddit,fcwhf2b,t3_ej3pte,1578025697.0,"Fat makes you fat... no no no, carbs make you fat. By carbs I mean both complex startch and sugar. Fats are not as easily absorbed into your body, most likely it'll uust pass through while carbs are the body's main source of energy and if you eat more than what you use of it, it gets stored in your body and also, you won't burn fat if you have carbs in your system. Low saturated fat diet = low testostorone levels


If you're already fat, however, following a strict low carb/ low fat diet may be best for you. It will not only help you shed the fat but will also put in place a healthy eating habit. Only after you lose most of it can you put it back in your diet."
