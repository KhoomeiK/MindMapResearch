Overwatch,fe4jyap,t1_fe4hy7y,1578860138.0,"Oh yeah, another reason why I don't use java for the mouse controlling is that it is nearly impossible to accurately control aim using absolute mouse coordinates (the game resets the mouse to the center of the screen each time.) You would imagine that if you were to send the mouse to the center of the screen, the aim wouldn't move, but that's not the case."
Overwatch,fe4hmit,t1_fe4fob1,1578859419.0,"Not planning on releasing the source at the moment as it only works with a particular setup (in game sens, resolution), and the code is very scuffed as I made it in a few hours. I do have a github @EDToaster though.

Here's a rundown of how I achieved this:

1. First, you need to figure out how to control the character's aim precisely. I was searching for a Java solution but there wasn't one that I could find. Java's Robot class only allows you to move the mouse cursor to a specific location (absolute movement), but I needed to be able to send mouse inputs (relative movement in terms of dx and dy) directly.
2. To accomplish this, I needed to write 2 native methods using JNI/C to be able to control the mouse using Win32 methods (or something like this, this is my first time using any Windows C libraries)
3. I went into the game and slowly moved the mouse around with step 2) to set mouse positions for each of the  65 keys.
4. Once I had the position, to play the music I just had to read a midi file (java has nice libraries for this), move the mouse, click then sleep for a duration. Position of the player is key here, as you need to be aimed and positioned at the right place."
