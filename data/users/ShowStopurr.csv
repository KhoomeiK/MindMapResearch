confession,fdhi4db,t1_fdhg2pf,1578423127.0,"I've heard this argument before and it's so fucked up! What he does is not her fault, or anything she should be held responsible for! He was a rapist before they met, and whatever he is after is still on him, not on her! She should report it, yes I 100% agree, but you've taken it waaaay too far when you say shit like that. You don't know anything about this person!! You are looking at this as a black and white issue, which is nice and simple and obviously fills you with smug satisfaction, you asshat, but there are grey areas! You are literally victim blaming, and I sincerely hope karma isn't what's required to make you see the error in your ways.

 OP, you are NOT responsible for that man's actions. EVER."
