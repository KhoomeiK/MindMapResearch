Your friends are clueless. The fact is women in their early 20s have less baggage than a women in her 30s. Hate to say it and most guys agree but after dating so much , etc women in their 30s tend to be alot more cynical. They may also have a kid, a crazy ex or a bunch of skeletons in the closet. Men do not want that. Its a fine and informed reason to not want to date a certain age group. Especially consideting the fact that womeb have the upper hand in dating.

A man in his 30s is alot more confident than his 20s self and can weigh up the risks more wisely.

Also, men do mature alower than women. It was so common in history for men to be with much younger women.

I see on dating apps lots of older women putting their age down. And i know these women personally. Because at their age, they know and are aware of the correlations that come with age for females
