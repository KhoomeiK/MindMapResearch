I think their argument is that you're doing nothing in both situations. The aid money isn't getting to the people who need it, regardless.

To an extent, that's true. But they can't steal ALL of the money, or it's too blatant, so you'd think at least some of it would get funneled somewhere useful. 

On the flip side, you've now enriched the people who were stealing from the poor already, and given them even more economic leverage to continue their bullshit. 

I don't know where the balance lies...

But we could certainly send some feds down there to start cleaning house, and provide better oversight for the allocated funds. That would be a step in the right direction."

No shit? Doesn't the FBI have jurisdiction? Can they not go down there and clean house? I said that to my BIL's dad, who is from PR, and he said they'd just get replaced with another corrupt politician. But...You still gotta try, right? They had to go all the way down to 22nd place to finally not have a cheater win the tour de France when they stripped Armstrong, but guess what? They did finally get to an honest person. PR needs *a lot* of help. Better federal oversight would go a long way for starters, but they have some pretty systemic problems in their politics and finances."

Zoomer is a mindset, not an age.

Well, no. You're uneducated, and selfish. Zoomer just happens to encapsulate most of your negative traits.


>While I'm not going to speculate about your age demographic, I *am* highly confident that you enjoy licking boot polish. 

Durrrr...You don't like people who try to scam a functional socialized healthcare system....boot licker...durrrr!

TIL not advocating for theft = boot licking.

LMAO...You don't know shit about the VA. The prosthetics the VA covers are not substandard. You and the other kid literally have no idea what you're taking about. You're uneducated.

You're a bunch of selfish children, that when given everything, ask for more at no expense to yourselves.

Typical selfish zoomer."

Yes they would you dumb child. You think free markets go away because of nationalized healthcare? 

Ok zoomer.

>The VA probably only covered shitty plastic legs that a man with 2 missing legs wouldn't be able to walk with

My FIL had two prosthetic legs from the VA. He walked everywhere just fine. Never complained once about his VA legs not being good enough. Drove himself from TX to CA with them. 

You're an uneducated child that plays nerdy card games.  You have no useful opinions on this matter."

I'm not surprised that you would be advocating to steal from the system you so desperately want to make national when you're such a net negative yourself.

Asking for national healthcare, and then advocating we steal from that system is even *more* zoomer than not reading articles. Classic selfish bullshit while pretending you care about others. Very zoomer. You sure you're not a zoomer?"

>That shit shouldn't be fucking expensive in the first place, most other first world countries have free healthcare.

It *isn't* you dopey fucking zoomer. If you could read for shit...

He could get prosthetics that *aren't* that expensive through the VA. But he wanted *special* legs that the VA wouldn't cover, so he went outside them. Then he refused to pay for them. The end. What do you think would happen with NHI if you didn't get your prosthetics through them? You pay for it. Durrrr. This is hard...

Zoomers not reading articles, but pretending they know what they're talking about...is there a more iconic duo?

I was pretty unambiguous, frankly. You should read more instead of playing your nerdy card games, so you don't sound like an uneducated rube."

Ok zoomer.

Let me help you not sound like an idiot.

There were no technicalities. The guy tried to get more than the nationalized healthcare you want so much would be willing to pay for. So he went outside them, got shit way more expensive than they would approve, and then refused to pay for them when he got them.

He fucked up. Not the VA. This exact same thing would happen under single payer, too. You think just because healthcare is nationalized that you get to choose the most expensive prosthetics possible? And then not pay for it? 

>Almost as if it would be nice if we prioritized people's inherent humanity and dignity rather than prioritize payment and profits

The VA *does.* They have more than one patient. That means you don't get to choose the most expensive shit possible when there is a perfectly serviceable moderately priced option, because they have to provide services to *everyone* not just your selfish ass.

That's how it works in EVERY system with national healthcare.

Zoomers."
