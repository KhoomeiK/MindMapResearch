Extracts: ""I took my seat in the chair. Persis and Asa stood at my right side; Persis to hand me restoratives; Asa to use his strength, if self-control were wanting. Dr. Judd stood at my left elbow for the same reason; my shawl was thrown off, exhibiting my left arm, breast and side, perfectly bare. Dr. Ford showed me how I must hold back my left arm to the greatest possible extent, with my hand taking a firm hold of the arm of my chair: with my right hand, I took hold of the right arm, with my feet I pressed against the foot of the chair. Thus instructed, and everything in readiness. Dr. Ford looked me full in the face, and with great firmness asked: ""Have you made up your mind to have it cut out?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Are you ready now?"" ""Yes, sir; but let me know when you begin, that I may be able to bear it. Have you your knife in that hand now?"" He opened his hand that I might see it, saying, ""I am going to begin now."" Then came a gash long and deep, first on one side of my breast, then on the other. Deep sickness seized me, and deprived me of my breakfast. This was followed by extreme faintness. My sufferings were no longer local. There was a general feeling of agony throughout the whole system. I felt, every inch of me, as though flesh was failing. During the whole operation, I was enabled to have entire self control over my person, and over my voice. Persis and Asa were devotedly employed in sustaining me with the use of cordials, ammonia, bathing my temples, etc. I myself fully intended to have seen the thing done. But on recollection, every glimpse I happened to have, was the doctor's right hand completely covered with blood, up to the very wrist. He afterwards told me, that at one time the blood from an artery flew into is eyes, so that he could not see. It was nearly an hour and a half that I was beneath his hand, in cutting out the entire breast, in cutting out the glands beneath the arm, in tying the arteries, in absorbing the blood, in sewing up the wound, in putting on the adhesive plasters, and in applying the bandage....
The doctor, after removing the entire breast, said to me, ""I want to cut yet more, round under your arm."" I replied, ""Do just what you want to do, only tell me when, so that I can bear it."" One said the wound had the appearance of being more than a foot long. Eleven arteries were taken up. After a beginning had been made in sewing it up, Persis said: ""Mother, the doctor makes as nice a seam as you ever made in your life."" ""Tell me, Persis, when he is going to put in the needle, so that I can bear it."" ""Now—now—now,"" etc. ""Yes, tell me. That is a good girl."" Ten stitches were taken, two punctures at every stitch, one on either side. When the whole work was done, Dr. Ford and Asa removed my chair to the back side of the room, and laid me on the lounge. Dr. Brayton came to my side, and taking me by the hand said: ""There is not one in a thousand who would have borne it as you have done."" The operation was a success and Lucy Thirston lived another 21 years."

CPAP,fdr2zhv,t3_emoqyb,1578678808.0,"I'm in the UK under the care of the NHS here. I had a sleep study (at home, one night, gadget on my thumb) under protest after mentioning to a lung function team that I snore when being treated for several pulmonary emboli. I went to my follow up appointment mid December, thinking I was in the clear, but determined to argue my way out of having CPAP if they said I needed it. When I was told my score was 84 an hour I realised arguing was fruitless. Went away with my Philips Dreamstation and full face mask feeling very grumpy. But, if I am going to do something, I commit 100% so I gave myself a good talking to and made myself adopt a positive mental attitude.  I fought the mask the first night and felt claustrophobic. But, the next morning I thought I'd been pumped full of oxygen! My score was ONE event in the entire night. So,  from over 600 events in one night down to one!! Hubby said the machine's low hum and my quiet Darth Vader breathing was a good exchange for the train roar snoring from before. He's delighted he can sleep without my snoring, thrashing about and going to the loo umpteem times (that has stopped too, despite my lymphedema). By night three I had completely got used to the mask to the extent that I woke up and thought it had fallen off.  It hadn't. Now I find it is a  comforting presence.

Basically, I've realised I hadn't slept in more than 15 years. Now I don’t know what to do with all the extra energy.  I was up at 5.30am on Day four and by 9.15am I’d cleaned out two cupboards, made breakfasts and lunches for the family, emptied the dishwasher, sorted nine freezer drawers, done a load of washing, fed our pets, potted up 75 bulbs in the garden, including constructing anti-squirrel measures, planted ten pot plants in window boxes, swept out the shed, made 24 marmite pin-wheels, wrapped a present and done some online shopping.  I’ve been like this ever since, including staying up to midnight watching telly with hubby instead of heading to bed.  I wasn’t ‘tired’ before, but perhaps just getting by, limiting my exertions to the miniscule amount of energy I had.  Now I’m supercharged!  I’m going to try a fitness video I used to use twenty years ago and hope to lose a lot of weight.  I'm also now eating keto, which helps with my lymphedema and fluid retention.  I was waking with a bit of a puffy face due to the mask and have found using two pillows instead of one has helped. Low carb eating will also help with that.  

I have my six week follow up appointment early Feb and I can't wait to tell the medics a huge thank you for persuading me have CPAP when I really didn't want it. I've never been so happy to be proved wrong in my life.  

I may post my comments as a standalone post too. Hope you don't mind. I suspect there are others out there who are feeling down about a recent diagnosis and if I can help in any way to make them feel better, I'd like to. 

I wish you all the very best."
