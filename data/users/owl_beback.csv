A member of my family lives in the electorate of Wentworth, which is Dave Sharmas territory. When the bushfires quickly became a PR nightmare for the Liberals, Dave Sharma sent out these ugly fridge magnets ( I wish I had a photo of one ), you know, the ones with the calendar on them that you sometimes get in the mail from plumbers or tradies.

The message said ""Merry Christmas"" and then a message about what the Liberal government was doing to help the bushfires, pretty much what Scumo is doing now. So, the shithead uses Christmas as a false premise to send these ugly AF fridge magnets, and then uses it as a propaganda tool/marketing device to brainwash people.

There are lots of people who hate the government and do not trust them and are individual investors so they don't have to depend upon the government. An old age pension is just not enough to get by on.

Why penalise them for rejecting the government  and their insufficient pensions. Certainly there are people who are wealthy but many investors are not rich, they just want a better option than what the government is giving them.

And that is why Bill Shorten unfortunately failed. He forgot about those middle of the road people. Alot of people rejected the government a long time ago.
