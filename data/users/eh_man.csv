I've been trying to experiment with the less popular government forms and theocracies were basically unfinished. I'm kind of skeptical about the new admirality type though. Makes pirates less unique without being a better choice for anyone I can think of.

Built all the wonders, researched every tech I could, and tried desperately to keep up with the booming population. I had a rough start, but I got lucky with my mystery (the free money rocks) and managed to tape my economy together with tourists and the hundreds of free food they bring with them. Exported a ton of food to China for metals and even advanced resources. Moving through the challenges now.

Ohio,fdlc8nn,t1_fdl3g9s,1578520932.0,"If you're being serious, gerrymandering is to blame. Ohio is one of the most efficient gerrymanders in the country. Our maps don't get quite as much attention as the super weird looking ones, but multiple federal courts found them to violate the constitution. It's only because the (extrordinarily partisan) Supreme Court decided that they don't have the power to enforce the Guarantee Clause that they were allowed to stand."

leagueoflegends,fdke96z,t1_fdkdbzm,1578502015.0,"Itemization in general is likely a big part, as well as a fear of being stuck on an all AD comp. I think it really cones down to how the make champion kits though. They have shown a tendency to overload the kits of AP assassins like Akali, Ekko, and Sylas in ways that they don't with AD assassins. Multiple dashes, in kit heals, free escapes, and lots of CC. Closest in the AD side would be Camille, but once again AD itemization just isn't as strong and lacks the overpowered passives and diversity of stats that hourglass, banshees, or the Liandries/Rylais/Morellos combo provide."

Some of the benefits from each with less of the draw backs of either.

politics,fdeqqma,t1_fde71db,1578344637.0,Because the Supreme Court has decided that it's beyond the courts' jurisdiction. That's it.

More over, they really don't want to have to accurately portray the way plagues caused a continent-wide societal collapse, it wouldn't be fun or interactive and it has more potential to make colonizers more OP than they already are (Spain's conquest of Central/South America is another thing the game portrays very inaccurately)."

leagueoflegends,fcfn93u,t1_fcfhbad,1577631939.0,"I mean, that sounds generic and obvious but the fact is it hasn't always been true. Let's day we look at Ryze top in lane phase. It used to be that he literally did not have the damage or mana to kill someone, at least before tear and 6. He literally just didn't have the damage in his kit. Ryze won lane by staying competitive in cs and avoiding trades so he could focus on trading his resources for farm. Now, with Conq, corrupting pot, and reworks that have traded  his skill ceiling for more damage at the floor he has more than enough in his kit to get a kill at level 2 or even 1. ""Earning"" kills (in the sense that you are more responsible for it than the other guys fuck ups) used to take serious planning and set up, even when you played super early hyper bullies like Rene or Teemo. You had to set up the wave to make then extend, get poke down ahead of time, bait out any vital CDs, and then be in alert for the moment when they overextend and you have space to kill them before they can get back to the turret or their jg could show up to help. With keystones you get so much free damage that you can skip most if not all of those steps without risking overextending yourself."
leagueoflegends,fcfe5z9,t1_fcfaki3,1577629032.0,"It's the keystones. They've become nothing but extra burst at this point, and a lot of it. Used to be that 100 to 0ing someone required both sums and for you to be a fed carry on a spike, otherwise a full rotation would do insufficient damage and leave you vulnerable to getting ranked without your R up. Now it's just a matter of landing all of your spells before they land all of theirs for almost any matchup. I've been playing for years and I've heard plenty of discussion about mobility creep, but no one seems to have noticed how far the bar has moved in terms of the damage in the game. Fuck keystones man, they add too much damage (guardian is the only one that doesn't do direct damage or fairly directly help you do more damage) and too many champions have been balanced around a single keystone. I'm sick of having the unique and interesting parts of champion's kits being removed because of the generic strength of Conqueror or Comet or DH."
