apple,ffae10q,t3_escp47,1579733388.0,"A few things:

First, Apple likely won't drop the port on all their phones at once.  There are something like 6 iPhone models rumored for next year, and the port isn't even rumored to be removed until the year after that.  If Apple releases an iPhone without a port, it will probably still release models that _do_ have a port in the same year (one rumor is that only the low-end phone will be without a port).  Either way, there will probably be an option to keep the port for at least a couple years after the first phone without one is released.

Second, while all this is happening, auto makers will be pressing ahead on Wireless CarPlay.  By 2024 or whatever when _no_ iPhones have a charging port, Wireless CarPlay may be as common as wired CarPlay is now.  Your next car might have a wireless charging pad on the dash, that also automatically connects your phone to CarPlay (this is a luxury feature in some BMWs I think).

There will be solutions, and a transition period.  If none of the transitory solutions work for, then maybe just don't buy an iPhone without a port until you're ready for whatever's next? No one is forcing you to buy a phone without a port..."

Yea, you are.  Ad targeting works and leads to increased sales.  If it didn't companies wouldn't bother with it.

You may have felt like you were working out there, but if your walk didn't kick your heart rate past its normal resting average, you're not getting Exercise credit for it.  Perhaps it took about ten minutes for your heart rate to kick into gear.

Could it be that you're not wearing your watch in a way that its able to track your heart rate?  I've found it has to be pretty snug up against your wrist to get a good reading.  I wear mine about 1 finger's width above my wristbone, and it seems to count literally any walking I do as exercise, even a causal walk around the corner, so I'm surprised you're having this problem."

So, Apple is providing a service that you deem beneficial to your app (privacy focused sign-in, with automatic email address obfuscation), and they’re charging for it while you want it for free.  Not likely to happen.  Apple is all about consumer privacy, but only if you’re willing to pay.  There’s a chance they may open up sign in with Apple, since they get some benefits from wider adoption, but it’s not really their style."

CGPGrey,fde90wr,t3_ehuc1u,1578333831.0,"It sounds like Grey has already grasped the philosophy behind meditation, but stopped short of actually practicing it. Since Grey lift weights, there's actually a very natural analogy here.  

The philosophy of weight lifting is that if you expose your muscles to repeated strain and load, they will grow over time.  To put this philosophy into practice, you lift heavy things over and over again until your muscles wear out, with the knowledge that over time this will lead to increased strength.  The knowledge alone that lifting weights will lead to muscle growth doesn't really you grow your strength, you need to practice too.

In meditation, the philosophy is that your mind is constantly chattering away, bringing up thoughts that may take us out of the present moment and reduce our focus.  Grey seems to already understand this perfectly, which is great.  The _practice_ of meditation, though, involves focusing on one thing, usually your breath, for an extended period of time. In this time, you intentionally dismiss any other thoughts that come up, and bring focus back to the breath.  Every time you notice, dismiss, and refocus, it's like your brain doing a mental bicep curl.

Doing this practice over and over again will eventually lead to increased focus overall, which is something I know Grey is interested in.  You don't need an app to do this. You can literally just sit for 10 minutes and focus on your breath, bringing your attention back to it any time another thought comes up.  I'd be curious how easy Grey finds this exercise."
CGPGrey,fde7fz5,t1_fcnkmxt,1578332838.0,"This is exactly correct.  Exercise is a good analogy.  Sure, you can _understand_ that picking up a heavy thing over and over again is difficult, and will lead to your muscles growing.  But, understanding that is really the tinies first step.  You get the benefit by actually doing it.

In the case of meditation, it sounds like Grey found the philosophy behind it very straightforward, but didn't actually try the practice of it.  The practice, in meditation, is keeping absolute focus on the breath, and systematically dismissing extraneous thoughts as they occur.  Every time you dismiss a though, it's like your brain lifting a weight.  Doing this over and over again will help improve your focus over time."
apple,fde1nkq,t1_fdd8du7,1578329161.0,"Just because you don't hear back does not mean you are not being heard.  Where I work (a software company ~1/100th the size of Apple), Product Managers read all feedback submitted through these official channels, make note of trends over time, and turn those trends into actionable tickets for engineers work on.  An individual bug they only see once may not get addressed, but if 10 pieces of feedback come in all requesting the same thing, or pointing out the same bug, it is 100% noted and work is planned around it.

Apple likely has entire teams pouring through the feedback they receive, and a systematized way of forwarding the feedback to the appropriate team or Product Manager.  The most common issues, features, and requests _do_ usually get addressed, it just takes time.  You're not shouting into the void!"
