todayilearned,ff7sxyi,t1_ff7s80t,1579657592.0,That’s entirely possible. Different demographics do have varying effects on jury pool selection.
todayilearned,ff7rzwv,t1_ff7lo5h,1579656936.0,"The accused already have a lot, and at some speicfic times I believe too many rights enumerated in our laws. The problem isn’t with rights for the accused and justice for victims; the problem as I stated earlier is with the overhwelming power and built in advantage the state and prosecution has in prosecuting crimes.      
The problem is with corrupted motivations (not criminal corruption, although there’s plenty of that) from police, to prosecutors, to jurors.     
All three have shown, time after time, a predisposition to going after and declaring guilty “beyond all *reasonable* doubt” the suspect, and defendant in front of them.      
Not statistically significant in representing the system as a whole, but there have been several high profile capital murder cases and severe rape cases where DNA evidence or credible evidence of true innocence has been brought to the prosecution’s attention, but the original DA refuses to acknowledge or accept it.     
The motivation of cops during an investigation shouldn’t be to prove their original suspicions were correct.     
The motivation of the prosecution during a trial should be to find the truth, regardless of whether they are forced to drop the charges; and dropping of charges shouldn’t be motivated simply by whether they believe they can get a conviction.     
The motivation for jurors shouldn’t be to “get justice for the victim;” it should be to do right by and deliver a just verdict on behalf of the defendant.      
I know that is terribly naive or too optimistic but that is my philosophy. I really don’t know what the most practical fixes are because in every system we will see one miscarriage of justice on either or both sides."

Would I vote to convict Judge Kavanaugh based soley on her testimony from the confirmation hearings? Absolutely not.      
Do I believe there was more out there that would disqualify him from a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court? Without a doubt.    
The FBI “investigation” and lack of thorough vetting was a disgrace."
todayilearned,ff7mlg8,t1_ff7l1im,1579653157.0,"Maybe I didn’t articulate my point well enough. If you looked back on the vast majority of trials, from capital murder to misdemeanor robbery, most jurors have an innate inability to objectively and fairly judge what is a reasonable doubt; and when confronted with this dilemma, history has shown that most (obviously not not) people lean towards believing prosecution arguments/evidence, however flawed they may be in retrospect.     
The jury system and prosecutorial misconduct was obviously much, much worse during the Jim Crow era, but even today, the sheer amount of convictions that are being overturned and found to be faulty due to a systemic bias *for* the prosecution is astounding.     
Even today, we have defendants (I’m not talking about people who aren’t disputing the facts of the case) who are convicted on the thinnest of cases.      
Overeager police who are under pressure to “close cases” and find *any* but not *the actual* perpetrator will fit evidence to their preferred suspect while ignoring/diminishing exculpatory evidence or arguments to the contrary.     
Overly ambitious prosecutors who want to eventually make a political career or highly compensated private career are able to frame arguments and evidence to fit their preferred narratives.     
Jurors who have little to no legal training and more importantly little to no training in logical and objective judgements."
todayilearned,ff7l1im,t1_ff7k0ra,1579652078.0,">more protection for the accused?   
    
>Or more protection for victims?  
      
Those two are not mutually exclusive concepts. The problem with criminal justice reform is that people conflate vengeance and swift blame for protecting victims.     
In a truly just society, railroading a person merely suspected of perpetuating a crime would be just as grave an injustice.     
For allowing the possibility and at times *probability* that the wrong person is punished and allowing the true perpetrator to go free is an insult and injustice to the victim as well as possible future victims.           
The basic principle of *“beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt”* has been bastardized and twisted by an imperfect jury system that has been clearly shown to be skewed towards the prosecution and state’s power to jail/execute."
