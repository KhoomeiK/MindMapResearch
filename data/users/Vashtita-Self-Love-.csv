I never said that there wouldn‚Äôt be a want or need for a friendship with others and I‚Äôm not saying to pick one over the other. There most definitely is a direct link between the two though. One affects the other. That doesn‚Äôt mean that you won‚Äôt encounter negativity in relationships but it the levels will be a lot less and the way one feels a out the situation and is able to productively deal with it shall improve dramatically. 

From my experience and the experience of those I‚Äôve encountered and mentored, a truly healthy relationship with self has inspired fruitful and healthy relationships with others. 

I just want to reiterate that I‚Äôm saying this all from both personal and professional experience. 

When we look at and study the six  human needs, all of those needs are not on the same level and wanting to be someone‚Äôs favourite person, that need for significance is on the lower end.  I‚Äôm not disregarding a need for love a connection, that will always be valid but there is no reason anyone should be actively seeking to be someone‚Äôs favourite person."
socialanxiety,fdjdulc,t1_fdix1c4,1578466705.0,"No not in the job scenario but becoming your own face our Ute person is completely different.  Speaking from personal experiences by the way, not just saying it because it may ‚Äúsound cute‚Äù. It‚Äôs real or at least was very real for me. I guess it all comes down to ones perception of being your own best friend is and entails. 

The more of a relationship you develop with yourself, the less reliant you become on the validation and acceptance of others. That‚Äôs facts. You‚Äôre able to let go of expectation and attachment and so how other people act/act towards you ceases to affect you to such a high degree.  There is absolutely no real reason to seek or wish to be somebody‚Äôs favourite person and positive human interactions are more likely to develop once that expectation is removed. 

That way of thinking all stems from a place of feeling inadequate, as if you don‚Äôt measure up. Once you realise that you are indeed more than enough, many areas of your life will be influenced. You‚Äôll think and behave differently, your self concept will reflect in your actions and the way you show up in the world and as a result you will begin to attract the right people into your life. 

If I‚Äôm so desperately seeking with a connection with another, I will come into contact with leeches who just take from me and drain me.

If However I seek a deeper connection with myself, I will grow and develop as a person, I will start speaking up when necessary, I will stop settling for less and begging overeating at my highest version which will eventually and inevitably attract like minded people who I can develop a positive and sustainable relationship with."

selflove,fdhpemd,t3_elfw54,1578427521.0,"Thanks for being so open. 

Instead of being sad about the things which transpired in high school be grateful that you are now in a better place. Celebrate the fact that you now have the tools that aid your confidence. Celebrate that you will now not miss out on opportunities or fun events. Be grateful that you can now live the life you deserve and you can inspire many more to do the same. 

Be happy for the person you were in secondary school, they didn‚Äôt stay in that place of negative thoughts, anxiety and sadness. They grew, they improved, they reshaped their thinking, they made it. YOU MADE IT!!!

Yesterday has gone, focus your attention on the here an now and be that phenomenal human being that you are. 

Self love can not truly exist without self acceptance. Accept your past experiences for what they were, accept that you were doing your best with what you had/knew and forgive yourself for being too hard on yourself. 

I‚Äôm so happy for you. 

Much love x"

It‚Äôs time for you to take control of your schedule and make the most of what you have. 
At the start of each week make a weekly planner detailing all of your lectures/seminars/classes, your study time and time you‚Äôll use to get assignments done. Once you‚Äôve done this you‚Äôll be able to clearly see how much time you have left for yourself. In this space, schedule things for yourself to do that will make your uni experience more enjoyable (join a club, go to the movies, do something creative, do the things you enjoy) and also schedule time for self care (treat yourself to a spa day or have a DIY spa day, go for a walk, get some fresh air, light exercise or meditation) and make sure that you prioritise this time just as much as you do your schoolwork. Instead of sitting in your room wasting time, make the most of your time. 

Invite your boyfriend to spend the weekends with you and you can also spend some weekends with him. Find new ways of keeping the romance alive. Also express your feelings to him, tell him how hectic things get for you and the effect it has on you. He should be able to positively support you. Listen to his feeling and see how you can positively support him. If you both want it to work then it will, you‚Äôre almost done with uni. Hang in there, you‚Äôve got this! 

To help with your eating habits, maybe consider doing a weekly meal prep so you don‚Äôt have to spend excess time cooking or worrying about what to eat. Also you can have healthy and natural snacks such as fruits, seeds and nuts that help to boost energy. 

Arrange family day where your family can come to visits you and you can hang out with them (go out for a meal, do a fun activity or something). 

You are determined to finish school for a reason, you obviously have a goal and a vision of what you hope to achieve in life so keep the end goal in mind. You are in your third year, you‚Äôre nearly finished. I‚Äôm sure that all of your hard work and sacrifices will pay of! 

Much love."
selflove,fcb30zj,t3_egvlif,1577581652.0,"You need to find ways to start practicing self awareness. 

I would advise that you start a journal. At the start of each day make note of how you are feeling and at the end of the day write how your day has been (what you experienced, how it made you feel, what you learned), use this as a time of self reflection. 

The more you self reflect the more you will be able to identify your triggers and the root cause for certain thought/behaviour patterns. The more you reflect, the more you‚Äôll learn about yourself, you‚Äôll develop a deeper understanding of yourself. 

Also, be completely honest with yourself at all times, no matter how difficult it may be and try to look at your experiences from various perspectives (be on the outside looking in) 

One thing that really worked for me was spending time alone. Away from the noise, away from the opinions and expectations of others. 

I hope this helps."
