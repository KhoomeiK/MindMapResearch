Making moves and changes is for real people. People like US will only be beaten down by our peers before we can even get to the authorities' office with our complaints, because they can't affect the authorities either and by god they're gonna get SOMEONE. We keep each other down as much as any authorities keep us down. Our lives are completely filled with our petty but omnipresent roles in the cycle of abuse, as both victims and perpetrators, and all of us do our part to keep each other cynical and hopeless. And we have a nigh-instinctive knowledge of just which parts of a person's spirit to break to keep them grudgingly conformant but comfortable enough not to be rebellious. And the ones who are strong enough to keep their spirit just kind of flake off and live on their own because there's no getting anywhere against that rubber wall.
