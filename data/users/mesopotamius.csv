Reading unedited interview transcripts is kind of irritating: it doesn't flow very well, there's all kinds of verbal filler, etc. Even though it's *literally what actual people said in a real conversation*, it doesn't function well in a textual medium. Trying to write dialogue as realistically as possible is going to make your writing weird and offputting, because you're not catering to the medium that you're working in."
