Want to develop your own adult hobby? Do that once a week and have your partner do dinner and bedtime with the kids (and there partner gets the same opportunity)! Want to travel? Do weekend trips or drivable trips and take the kids! Wanna have date night or girls night? Do it once a month! 

But it's just easier to let the kid's routine and schedules rule your life because you don't want to deal with the tantrums when the kids have to adapt and you don't want to have to ask your partner to take over for a night or, or, or...

What they're all missing is that, by ensuring they get their alone time ir adult time or date time,  the kids will have to adapt to a different routine,  learn how to live without mommy or daddy for a few hours, and, you know,  learn they're not the center of the universe.  It's not easy and there will be breakdowns,  but a few breakdowns when kids are young is better than young adults who can't function without their parents."

The marriage at a certain age (doesn't even seem to matter who you're dating, just convince yourself they're""the one""), the mortgage,  the kids, and working the same shitty job for 20+ years... none of these things are conscious, proactive decisions.
