I really enjoy Pirateaba's Wandering Inn web serial. The series is pure fantasy fun, bringing a humanist world-view to what could be a grim fantasy setting. She's incredibly productive, and would benefit greatly from a good editor. The first few volumes are on ebook, and subsequent chapters are posted twice a week.

I've read most, but not all of Wildbow's Worm, which is a fun superhero/villain serial. It's pretty pulpy and breathless, but mostly a blast.
