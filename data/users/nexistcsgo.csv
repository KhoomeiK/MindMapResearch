My mom went through that magnetic ticket checking gate but when I tried, I realised I had lost my ticket. I tried contacting the customer care centre at the station but there were already a lot of people. 

So this lady who saw me struggling at the customer care goes ""excuse me. You should come with me. We can both cross at the same time."" Since the guard was busy elsewhere, we passed through the gate with me in front and she closely followed. 
I thanked her for helping me and she replied ""it's alright. I know those customer care centre people can sometimes be a pain. ""

That day I realised that there's still good people out there."
