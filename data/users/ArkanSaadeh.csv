Dresden was hit by a force of 722 RAF bombers, & 527 USAAF bombers, all guarded by 784 USAAF fighters, Americans were absolutely involved. In total the US targeted Dresden in 6 air raids through 1944-1945.

>I’m not saying bombing of cities wasn’t horrific but we were fighting a world war against an enemy that wouldn’t give up,

Based on what? By late 1944 when terror bombing picked up the Germans were quite literally getting obliterated on every single front. We torched ancient cities to the ground not at the height of the Nazi war machine, but well after the disasters in Tunisa, Stalingrad, Bagration, Falaise, etc.

 We know from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey & Albert Speer himself that targeting oil facilities was *catastrophic*, while ""disrupting workers"" (allied doublespeak for killing civilians) had a dubious effect, was controversial even at the time, and left the world worse off."
CombatFootage,ff444oj,t1_ff43ewe,1579555121.0,"> First off American bombers generally bombed industrial targets essential to manufacturing the nazi war machine. 

Based on what? The US & UK practiced terror bombing and targeted entire cities, including civilian areas. Berlin took more damage from allied bombing than the Soviet battle, Hamburg had 40k civilians killed in one raid, 25k dead in Dresden, & nearly all of Tokyo was burned to the ground. 

Any moral defense of US or UK bombing raids hinges on their necessity to stop the Axis, full stop. There's no need to go deeper than that and pretend that said raids were less damaging than they were, because they were absolutely horrific by our modern standards. The US & UK absolutely deliberately targeted civilian areas with the intention of psychological warfare, but it was WW2 & not 2020.

Edit: I also forgot to mention that the actual effectiveness of Allied bombing campaigns is disputed. German industry generally only suffered temporary delays & loss of productivity due to damage. However it should be mentioned that attacks on German & Romanian oil facilities + railways & transportation systems had an absolutely devastating effect on the German war effort from 1944 onward. 

Hard to find any figures other than Bomber Harris arguing in favor of any positive effect from burning German cities to the ground. Also nice to see that this sub officially has been brigaded by Americans who take any criticism as a personal attack."

You're conflating etymologies to contend with what you want to believe. Christ wasn't buried in a coffin six feet under, was he?
