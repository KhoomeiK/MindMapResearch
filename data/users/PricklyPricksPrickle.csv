I had a shitty parent, and because of her abuse I’ve been scared to be “mean”. 

I met my S.O and he thought me how to create a back bone.. of you will. 
It’s easy enough to learn but hard on your heart/emotions. 
I’ve been threw a whole purge system for years because of it. 
I’ve lost so many people but I’ve gained so much. 
It’s always better to grow, and loose than it is to be stuck and miserable because “ everyone does x,y,z to you” 

I used to also think I was a magnet for bad people. They just saw I was able to be taken advantage of, for my kindness and weakness. 

Not anymore. Sometimes when I say no, or not interested in referred to a “ Bitch, insensitive, or with a lack of heart” But honestly I know that’s because they wanted something from me that I wasn’t willing to give. I shouldn’t feel bad about it.

ottawa,ff27mhd,t1_ff0hoko,1579496136.0,"I was a bit to worried about posting but I work in the food industry here in Ottawa. I have been for 15 years. 
I’ve been told 100 times to open up my own place. Honestly that involves throwing everything into a fire pit and watching it burn expecting a Phoenix to fly out and rain money upon me. It’s a lot more than just passion to run a place. I cook and bake non stop. Even at home I love all food aspects. 

During the winter is the hardest for any restaurant to stay open that isn’t a franchise. Most “click” areas are barren during regular days.  

Money needs to fall from the sky’s and keep raining. You don’t see your money back for about 6 years and that’s if you don’t tear your hair out and quit. 

Staff is 100%,hard to hold on to. All aspects suck in this department. 
From the employee stand, your over worked and under-paid to the point of insanity. Your creative skills will most likely be thrown down a well, all in good faith for you to recover it in a 10 years when you moved up a slot. 3-15 hour days. 
Employers have to deal with mass turn over, no shows, potential drug abusers, and burning out. Zero benefits to make a career with. 

The Wait staff, I can’t do there job. So I always applaud them. I can handle rude, cranky, bitchy, sexual harassing, drugged up kitchen staff but I can’t do customers. 

I’ve had terrible stories told to me about the customers in Ottawa specifically. 

People travel around the world to appreciate food but for some reason, not here. No one cares. They may care if they they get amazing quality for 9.99$. 

Most of all, new places tend to bail on there ideas and crumble to the customers here. They want a burger, chicken salad, salmon, wrap, steak and chicken wings. A lot of people complain as if each restaurant needs these “standards” 

The saddest is when you get the owners who loved what they had and they turn so bitter and resentful. Their whole business goes down with them. 

All for that one smile, that one person who appreciated that one dish. 

I m now a baker, being a chef was awful.
Even bakers are struggling."

Yesterday we had that down pour, and I decided to bus the short walk to stay dry. My S.O was out with the car. Not a big deal. 
It took 1 and a HALF hours to get down the street. I waited for two buses 40-45mjns each. Both were major bus routes. I should have just soaked myself instead.

For coyotes to come into the city, you must have a food source for them or you took there food source/home and there lost.  They stay away like foxes do but if your pet scares them, it will attack. Unlike foxes who will try to find a safe route away.
