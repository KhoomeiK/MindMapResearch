depression,fdq31kw,t1_fdpznqp,1578652415.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful comment. 

I think there was a fault in their system and as it is a public clinic they are busy all day. The time was up, so I had to book another pointment, I will address this in the future."

depression,fdq2umd,t1_fdq00j2,1578652142.0,"Thank you for your comment. 

I will ask her the reasoning behind her actions, might just be a fault in their systems. Its a public clinic so it can be busy, so maybe just a bad day."
depression,fdq2ltr,t1_fdq00ni,1578651798.0,Thank you for your advice. That surely wasnt something expecting from her.

dogs,fcleaci,t3_eho07v,1577745798.0,"It was a healing experience to take care of someone else. You had to do certain things like go out, feed, clean in a regular bases. 

As she grew older, the more I managed to balance my own depression and became more aware of my limits. It didnt cure my depression, but made me a more functional person.

As she is now 1.5 years old, I am better than ever. I can manage school and theraphy and always have a reason to continue.

Dog is not an answer nor a cure. I cannot recommend getting a dog  as a treatment. My dog, Cola, is my best friend and thats why it works for me. We train each other on a daily bases. Its requires work, but can result in a relationship which benefits you both."
FanFiction,fagssnw,t3_e95mlg,1576070156.0,"I usually like a bit more dark fics, especially those that have realistic outcomes on a bad situation.

 I'm currently working on a story where our main protagonist gets majorly depressed and addicted to his drugs because it ables him to see his dead friend, or so he thinks.

Something about a well written dark/dystopic wolrd just seems so interesting. A/B/O universe can be interesting if its done well and the world feels authentic. Like what if a secondary genger really existed? How would the dynamic really go? Why?  

I really like world building and believe it needs a bit darker edge to be interesting. Nothing too overboard but something twisted in it, so it is not quite perfect."
