bestof,fesu5r7,t1_fespvlz,1579369011.0,""" Civil Beat found no evidence that Tulsi Gabbard is — or ever was — a  Butler devotee. And we could find no record of her ever speaking  publicly about it. "" That is from a huffington post article. Do you have any kind of evidence that she's actually part of this cult? Or do you just believe rumors?"
bestof,fesr1wz,t1_fesqe84,1579368106.0,"If I learned something that made me think they were dishonest I wouldn't vote for them. Until all this happened I was willing to vote for Warren. Shit changes, someone already convinced me Gabbard would be a bad choice. Go take a look at what I post in that sub, mostly I'm trying to convince people Bernie isn't a communist."

bestof,fesolmg,t1_fesnikd,1579367455.0,"I'd be concerned about whatever corporate shill Warren would bring in as well. Republicans and democrats are different flavors of the same shit. Republicans are conservative and family values hurr hurr, and democrats are social justice, protect minorities oh aren't we virtuous. Then they all get together and vote for more war, less pay, less representation and the country slides further down the shitter no matter who's in office. Which is why the character of the candidate means so much to me. Warren pretends to be for the working people. Is she going to overturn citizens united? No, because she loves billionaire donations just as much as Republicans."

I can not vote for a dishonest person. That rules out Biden and Warren and Buttigeig. I really am sorry for mocking you, I just feel so strongly that everyone's willingness to vote for a corrupt person is a massive threat to what little democracy we have left."

bestof,fesk7nl,t1_fesjpyw,1579366090.0,"I don't really know much about Gabbard or Yang, but they support policies I support, that is why I'd consider voting for them. Obviously Bernie is my main choice. Did she defend assad? Or did she simply suggest we lied about him gassing his own civilians?
