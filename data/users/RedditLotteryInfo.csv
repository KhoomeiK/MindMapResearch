Lottery,ffa854m,t3_esibns,1579729744.0,"I've met Powerball and Mega Millions jackpot winners, as well as jackpot winners for local games. It is most certainly not staged, there's far too much at stake."
LotteryLaws,fefsicr,t1_fefrkbn,1579063878.0,Yea everyone gets wrapped up in the biggest jackpot frenzy and a lot of people don't realize that level of money comes with a lot of responsibility. There are many cases of good and bad outcomes but my number one recommendation to people that play casually is to pick a smaller game. You can win 5 or 6 figure prizes and fly largely under the radar while knocking out your mortgage payments. It's not fuck you money but it let's you keep living a relaxing life.
LotteryLaws,fefq99i,t1_feflgl9,1579062130.0,"Perhaps ""family and friends"" was a bit too specific. Do you think anonymity would have saved David Lee Edwards, Jack Whitaker, or Michael Carroll?

I'll give you Craigory Burch and Abraham Shakespeare, though I'm not sure anonymity would have helped Abraham either if he was letting homeless people stay in his house and making poor decisions. You could argue Dee Dee wouldn't have known about his money, but the way he was spending it everyone would have known anyway."
ExplainBothSides,fefks5x,t1_fefjzb1,1579058426.0,Yes - on a temporary basis while budget conflicts were resolved. Everyone still got paid.
LotteryLaws,fefht61,t1_feejq4u,1579056611.0,"I think you'll find that in some of the worst stories of lottery-wins-gone-bad, 9 out of 10 times that ill fortune stems from the winner's own family and friends. Anonymity laws are never going to prevent them from finding out you won."
C_S_T,fec7xe4,t3_eocmeb,1578968200.0,"Is this subreddit Critical Shower Thoughts or Conspiracy Shower Thoughts?

Lottery games are not investment opportunities, they're entertainment with chances to win money. Integrity and real winners is what keeps them running.

I work in the industry and I'm happy to answer any lottery questions but if you want specific answers just let me know what state and what game you're so convinced is rigged."

Edit: He got me good. But still, your government annuities are safe, people."
ExplainBothSides,fe46rta,t1_fe45dbi,1578856294.0,"The lottery annuities are usually based on government bonds, and you could certainly do better over time with the right planning."
ExplainBothSides,fe45rab,t1_fe43wn8,1578856082.0,Under what circumstances?
ExplainBothSides,fe437d9,t1_fe33wvr,1578855345.0,"""Lottery companies"" are state governments (at least within the US). They're not going to go broke over a lottery annuity, and if they do, you have bigger problems."
ExplainBothSides,fe42hq8,t1_fe38wuc,1578855105.0,Both Powerball and Mega Millions pay their jackpot annuities over 30 payments (once a year from year 0 through year 29). The payments are graduated and increase 5% every year to help with inflation.
ExplainBothSides,fe26yff,t1_fe21hqj,1578835098.0,That's the point of this account though?
ExplainBothSides,fe07mah,t3_enj1as,1578805208.0,"It really comes down to where you are in life and that you know about yourself and your financial responsibility. In this scenario, let's imagine your prize is a $30 annuity ($1/year for 30 years) with a $20 cash value, for simplicity.

For cash value - $20 in your pocket today is definitely useful. It has a lot of buying power right now and you get it all at once. You have the ability to invest it at your own discretion and varying risk/reward levels. If you were to die within the next 30 years, you still get to enjoy the full experience of your prize.

For annuity - if you can reasonably expect another 30 years of life and want to ensure payments over that term, the annuity isn't a bad option. It comes with a built-in safeguard in that you can't spend your $20 all at once and be broke forever. Even if you spend your dollar that year, you'll get another dollar next year. If you die within the term of the annuity, it will continue to pay out to your estate, but that's not exactly fun for you at that point.

More factors are at play regarding investment return rates and other financial responsibilities, but realistically any prize big enough is just going to come down to knowing yourself, your future, and your wants/needs."
unpopularopinion,fdznjp2,t1_fduwh3y,1578792019.0,Lottery is sold the most in the most populous areas. Spending is relatively proportional across the population though.
unpopularopinion,fdzmz7u,t1_fduvmvs,1578791902.0,">They are **designed to target and take advantage** of people who have a psychological predisposition to gambling addiction. 

>They can also act as regressive taxes on people of lower socioeconomic classes **(who spend much more on the lotto)**.

Do you have any sources to back up these claims at all? Or are you just guessing based on your assumptions?

I think you'll find that many state lotteries actively try to reduce and prevent problem gambling. As well, spending is pretty proportional across economic classes."
AskAnAmerican,fdpd822,t1_fdo3vq3,1578625673.0,">a large part of the money raised comes from those deeply addicted to gambling

You got a source for that statement?"
todayilearned,fd8vrgw,t1_fd7g47g,1578224126.0,"Of the states on that list, only 10 allow any sort of real anonymity. Add Texas and Virginia with some asterisks. Seems like a small handful to me?"
todayilearned,fd5m3li,t1_fd5jrfm,1578178946.0,"Honestly, unless you won a Powerball/Mega Millions jackpot, no one even cares. If you don't want the attention that comes with a multi-million dollar prize, play a smaller game. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
todayilearned,fd5j5im,t1_fd5hl4s,1578178166.0,"Nope, and there's only a small handful of states that allow anonymity."
Showerthoughts,fd5gz49,t3_ek2rxg,1578177532.0,Honestly you'd be surprised if you actually looked into how many people win big amounts of money playing the lottery.
todayilearned,fd5ew4v,t3_ejyyvz,1578176931.0,"Lottery employee here, I'm the guy that interviews big winners and gives out these checks.

Generally my threshold for meeting and interviewing a big winner is $50,000 or more. However, a smiling face and a novelty check is fun at any prize amount, so I'll do it for anyone that asks. Smallest one I've done so far is $1,000."
