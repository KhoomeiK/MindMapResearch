CatsAreAssholes,fecsy47,t3_eoguty,1578983395.0,"I've owned cats my whole life and fostered many as well. Beware that cat ownership turns into a form of Stockholm syndrome. Your cat(s) will own you and you will love every minute of it.  

There's no need to spend a lot on toys unless you want to. My cats' favorite toys are socks, the dog, scrunchies, and a $1 squeak toy from the dollar store. Just make sure their toys are safe. No rubber bands, cellophane, etc.

I do recommend splurging on high quality kitty chow. Makes the litter box stink less, they generally don't eat as much so it lasts longer, and it's better for their overall health. 

Find a good vet that will listen to your concerns and work with you. Bonus points if they accept payment plans for emergency visits. Get kitties vaccinated even if they are strictly indoors (escapes happen) and do healthy kitty checkups at least once a year.

Familiarize yourself with cat law (ie, a cat sleeping on you should not be disturbed. Therefore you may get trapped with warm snuggles on the sofa for hours at a time.)

AskReddit,fe6gi12,t3_eny7ma,1578890189.0,A school near me has banned scrunchies on wrists/arms. Scrunchies can only be worn in the hair by females.
