the way the cops just ran around the car to make sure to get a few shots in is what it looks like when i feed the hogs.

that looked a lot like a swarm of, well, pigs...  these humans are ***not*** good enough to be called hogs.  little piggies everywhere.

fucking hog of a lady starts trying to protect a dumbass that not only brings a bat to a fist fight but swings it at the fucking biggest person in the fight.  the fucking monster catches it, snatches it, get two good swings in, and then, lands a fucking solid right.  the mother, if you can call her that, then starts trying to say that having the bat is wrong when her kid was the one that both brought and used the bat first.  

fucking people.  i mean, if your kids want to fight, stand back and watch or stop them from entering the yard.  you can not have both."

he is the guy that put metal edges on skis and gave Arthur Ashe his metal racket.

he is dead now.  his wife asked me to put a 'smart system' into their house. this was in the first home of Vail, CO.  my Master and i were the only people involved and we terminated every line.  you are misrepresenting what you do.  

i lost my wedding ring in another 'smart' home.  i didn't have a camera at the time and the walls were about 10k$ each if i wanted to cut them open.  i have remodded so many homes from standard to smart that it is just the way it goes now.

and i never have to call a tech.  like, seriously.  if you need a specialized person to come and do color coded tech because the wires are smaller and easier to stab, you are being robbed."

my Roku will only answer to a certain HDMI cable.  i get it...  pirates=bad.  but, why is it changing so fast that my tool i bought last year (Roku) is refusing to work with the HDMI cable i bought in the same store on the same day at the same time?
