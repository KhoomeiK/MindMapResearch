Bayonetta,fffxr6p,t1_fffw2xe,1579894112.0,"Agreed. Loki was interesting but I didn't really get too attached to him. 

Gameplay and dialogue felt smoother when I was fighting alongside Balder/Jeanne/Rosa."

This. This is why I can't really get attached to Loki in gameplay. He's an interesting character but I wish he didn't repeat this stuff every 3 seconds when I go slightly left to open a chest. So, I agree with the removing of additional dialogue as an option.

They did the same thing with Balder and Rosa but they weren't nearly as annoying and you were only with them for a shorter period.

I also like the idea of costume bonuses!"
Sephora,ffabsbj,t3_esiw5j,1579731828.0,Worry not. I thought the same thing happened to me but it just takes a day or two for the order and the points to process.
