AskReddit,fgu8e28,t3_f0b8bf,1581114830.0,"Saw two of the craziest fights I’ve seen in my life at my high school. Our star football player, who was normally quiet, beat the absolute shit out of a basketball player who made a mom joke about him. Only time he ever got in trouble and it was amazing he wasn’t expelled b/c he fucked the other dude’s face up. 

Side note, the football player’s older brother was recently arrested for murder which it definitely looks like he committed.

The other fight was two girls, who were best friends, got into a fight right before school started. No idea why they fought, but the smaller girl (by at least 20lbs) whooped the bigger girls ass and shocked everyone.

We also had an award for the senior students who best exemplified Christian values and they were prominently featured in the year book. The guys who won this award from my sister’s class and then four years later for my class both knocked up their respective girlfriends shortly after the year books went out."
