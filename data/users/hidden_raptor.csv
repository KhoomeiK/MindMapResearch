todayilearned,ffpyo10,t1_ffogl4p,1580111210.0,"I think you are missing a part of why moonshine and mountain dew have a connection. Mountain dew never had alcohol, it's just that the name, mountain dew, had previously be used to refer to moonshine created during prohibition. production often secluded to the mountains, hence the liquid made in the mountains (moonshine) was called mountain dew. so when Mountain Dew ^TM came about they were tapping into that hillbilly mountain moonshine maker vibe, trying to equate their soda with the fun and craziness that happens when you drink moonshine.

I'm not sure if Psuitable-Pseudonym's claim that mountain dew was created to go with moonshine. I think it was more a marketing thing. Mountain Dew didn't come out until like decades after prohibition so I don't know why someone would make a soda to go with moonshine, which wasn't popular at all after prohibition."

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffpwgx1,t1_ffpk22z,1580108428.0,"Dang it. Can I not have one original thought. It's weird for some random reason I watched the giant bomb interview with jonathan blow yesterday and then started up the game for a second playthrough. But the early puzzles I still remembered too well and were too easy and then I was thinking about the later puzzles and how fucking insane some of them get, and although it was worth it the first time to figure all that shit out and take screen shots and flip them around and change opacity and color hue in photoshop and whatnot, the thought of doing all of that again made me quit. Love the game (might even put it as one of my favorite games of all time or at least the last couple decades) but I don't know if I can do it again. Maybe in like 20 years. (jon blow would love to hear me thinking about playing his game 20 years from now and seeing what I think about it many decades removed)

I think one of  the most interesting parts of the interview is when he talks about how hard it was to have to design an entire world/island without being able to use circles; even the minecarts' wheels' aren't circular but some weird triangle shape.

If one hasn't played the game and doesn't know why they couldn't make circles in the world (for the most part) besides the puzzles on the panels, I won't spoil it for you on the off chance you play the game at some point (which anyone who likes puzzles and figuring out rules should)

But there is a real good reason why, as designers, they couldn't just put circles into the environment.

Someone that reads my whole elongated comment could may figure out what I'm talking about, but probably not.
