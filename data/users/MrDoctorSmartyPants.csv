There’s, as of yet, no evidence that the Saints PR team knew what the “bad thing” was. Maybe the church specified. Maybe they didn’t.  If they DID, the. This is a cluster fuck. If they didn’t, and we’re just asking for advice, I don’t see how the PR team did anything wrong. That being said, they probably aren’t fighting to keep these emails private for no reason."

CFB,ffffls2,t3_et425l,1579882898.0,"So if Boise did this and went to the AAC for football, it would effectively end the P5 and G5 at large bid thing right? Because pretty much every team from the G5 that has ever had ANY shot at the playoff would be in the AAC.  But would an undefeated AAC team be considered on equal footing with a P5 team? 

Say for instance Boise this past year beats SMU, Cincinnati, houston, UCF, and Memphis, beats one of those teams twice and is the undefeated conference champion....do they have a legitimate chance of being 4 over Oklahoma? Because with how strong that schedule would have been according to the rankings this year, if they run that table and don’t get a shot, no team from the G5 ever would.

Would throwing in a victory over a mid tier SEC team like Tennessee or Mississippi State...or a Pac 12 team like Washington State or Arizona State..give them any more of a legitimate shot?"

nfl,fff5hqn,t3_et4yas,1579876212.0,"I was indifferent about the guy through pretty much everything he’s put himself through. The guy acts like an idiot? Who cares. Screws himself out of several contracts because of it? Oh well, it’s just because the guy is hard to get along with, maybe he’ll straighten himself out when he realizes he’s blowing his career. It was more concerning when it came out he is a borderline sexual predator that seemingly can’t control his sexual impulses. Now he’s physically attacking people? It’s obvious whatever is affecting him is getting worse and going unchecked. Is he going to seriously injure or kill someone next? Two things are certain....he has no business being anywhere near an NFL field and he needs some serious help....Whether it’s mental illness, CTE, or drugs...odds are it’s one or more of the three. 

Now they’re saying the reason he wasn’t arrested when it happened is because he locked himself in his house and wouldn’t come out? He should catch a felony for that too. I can’t believe they just left his house and left a violent criminal on the loose. I’ve never heard of anything like that.

But even if it is CTE, what can you do besides put him in jail for the crimes he’s already committed? Then what do you do when he’s served his time? Put him in a mental facility? Because you can’t rehab CTE. If you turn him loose, it won’t be if he hurts someone else, it will be when and how badly."

As troopers, we have a county wide rotation so even if one company is in sight of the accident and the driver doesn’t have a preference, the trucks can come from who knows how far. We aren’t supposed to just call who we want, but if I call for who is next on rotation and I know they’re 40 miles away, I’ll call who I want. Or who I know. I don’t want to wait around with a closed road for an hour or more waiting on someone. But a lot of times they’ll hear where we are and if it’s too far, they’ll ask to be skipped.

I had a name and a phone number so I googled the name and it popped up as a gas station which I knew for sure wasn’t right.

The 5 seconds of silence before he answered me told me he was trying to figure out what the fuck I was talking about.

As troopers, we have a county wide rotation so even if one company is in sight of the accident and the driver doesnâ€™t have a preference, the trucks can come from who knows how far. We arenâ€™t supposed to just call who we want, but if I call for who is next on rotation and I know theyâ€™re 40 miles away, Iâ€™ll call who I want. Or who I know. I donâ€™t want to wait around with a closed road for an hour or more waiting on someone. But a lot of times theyâ€™ll hear where we are and if itâ€™s too far, theyâ€™ll ask to be skipped.

Well, Iâ€™m a state trooper myself and apparently this company is new to the rotation because I had neither heard of it nor did I know where the hell their yard was. 

I had a name and a phone number so I googled the name and it popped up as a gas station which I knew for sure wasnâ€™t right. So I googled the number and it pulled up that same store, so I thought, well, maybe they expanded. So I called and asked the guy that answered if he was at that little store. The 5 seconds of silence before he answered me told me he was trying to figure out what the fuck I was talking about. He gave me his address and I typed it into google and turns out the guy was like 3 miles away, the business name listed at that address on google was NOT the name of his business though...I told him about it but Iâ€™m not sure thereâ€™s much he can do."
