techsupport,fcuoetc,t3_ednssi,1577985284.0,"I've used it myself, the parts of the software that get flagged are the crypto miners, because most Antivirus software assumes that any cryptominer that it stumbles upon was installed without the knowledge of the user. I haven't had any issues with it whatsoever, it does have bugs and doesn't work at times, but that's to be expected from software that is in alpha. The code is accessible on their GitHub as well: [https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-applications](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-applications) 

It's also important to take your local power costs into consideration to make sure you actually profit from it.

In the end it's your decision as to whether or not you'd like to use it, but it's safe."
