He's on a winning streak that includes Darren Elkins, BJ Penn via submission, Gray Maynard, and ARTEM THE GOAT LOBOV. He has an incredibly sympathetic story with his kids so he's marketable. 

He's even white too like damn. 

Like why the fuck isn't he on Dana's lips every time anyone asks him about stars? Is the division really that stacked? Casey Kenney is #15 so maybe so. I still think Hall could be a star if they put forth any effort at all."
