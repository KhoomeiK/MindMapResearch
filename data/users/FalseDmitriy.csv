Lutheranism,fel3kn5,t1_fejmol2,1579213308.0,"I suppose my perspective is different, then. There are not many Christian groups whose differences I would describe as ""fundamental"" - which I guess I would take to mean, we have totally different premises for our thinking, we won't find common ground, we don't have the same faith. Mormons, I suppose, maybe other nontrinitarian groups. Muslims, I would say, have a fundamentally different understanding of who God is. Anyone who treats Jesus as a moral teacher and nothing more. 

But other Christians who share the same faith and creeds? I would never describe those differences as ""fundamental,"" no matter how misguided I might think some of their teachings or emphases might be. And that's doubly so for other Lutherans, who bring the same set of understandings and vocabulary. You talk about the radically different approaches to the Bible. To me the most basic, most characteristically Lutheran way to approach the Bible is the concept of Law and Gospel. Everything pointing to Christ. Different interpretations of what this or that passage says, different understandings of particular sins or matters of church polity? What is that compared to the Law and the Gospel? Do we read the Bible primarily to understand God's promise, or to develop a list of particular rules? What sits there at the center of it all?

When I emphasize how new these questions are that you emphasize, I don't mean to say that they're unimportant because they are new. I mean that because they are in the air, they seem much bigger than they are. They attract too much attention at church conventions and media reporting. They disrupt the unity of the church by seeming to infuse political conflicts with spiritual significance, making people think they're rivals or enemies. And in your case, it makes you almost literally shut your eyes to the things our faith has in common, because I'm with the liberals and so obviously must be on the other side of the chasm."

Lutheranism,feinha1,t1_feicacr,1579142653.0,">I am interested in being better at articulating our differences. As said above, I don't know much about the ELCA. The little I have heard and the little that I come across in mainstream media paints a picture of the ELCA as being fundamentally contrary to the LCMS. But I know too little to be able to say something intelligent here.

Understanding our differences is important, but it really seems to me that you seek them out. And when you say things like ""You may try to wiggle your way around it by appealing to your liberal theologians,"" it seems that you question not just the conclusions but also the intentions of a whole lot of your fellow believers. It is possible to take the Bible very seriously and still come to different conclusions. 

Growing up in the Missouri Synod myself, I remember being surprised, and then surprised at being surprised, the first time I visited a more liberal church. (It was Lutheran but I think not actually part of ELCA, but I don't remember clearly.) Huh, I remember thinking, they talk about God and sin and all the other Christian things, I guess I had the impression that they all were just sort of faking it. And I think that was because, at some point in my upbringing, I had internalized the message that living a life of faith meant taking certain culture-war stances, that the Church's main role was as a bulwark against certain societal and political changes. That the Church is something much more than that was a fairly eye-opening revelation for me.

> I see the questions about sexuality and women in the church as symbols of a more fundamental disagreement. 

And again, I allege that you see those particular issues as symbolic (and more symbolic than, say, questions on baptism or Communion) because they happen to be hot-button questions right now. They are pretty far from being at the center of Christian doctrine. Jesus and the Fathers didn't exactly build their church on the idea of not ordaining women.

> And believe me, I see plenty of disagreements with Presbyterians. I converted from PCA to LCMS and I have spent many hours pouring over the differences. Many don't see much of a difference, but I can assure you that I am very aware of the real differences.

> A quick Google search reveals that the ELCA is in fellowship with the PCUSA. Apparently your differences are not as big as to be of much concern. The LCMS is not in fellowship with any Presbyterians.

That's because the ELCA has a very different approach to the idea of fellowship, basically seeking closer links with anyone willing to participate; this despite theological differences. Another example is the agreement with the Episcopal Church that has restored apostolic succession to our bishops, not because we believe it's necessary but because it connects us to the ancient and worldwide church in this profound way. ELCA would surely be in fellowship with the Missouri Synod if they were willing, but its approach is basically the opposite - that fellowship should be limited to church bodies that are in total agreement on almost everything. It's a different attitude toward ecumenism.

> Look, I get it. You think we are so similar because we share some history and we on the surface ""believe"" the same things. I see something deeper. 

I don't see how there's anything surfacey about God, justification, and the Sacraments. That's the bedrock stuff.

It kind of sounds like you really think liberal Christians are all just sort of pretending. It would be a good idea to talk to more of us, see that we mean it.

> If you want to be constructive, then feel free to give me stuff to read. If you truly believe that I have misunderstood what the ELCA believe, then provide me with something to read or watch that can convince me that the ELCA still truly holds to the Book of Concord and hasn't fundamentally departed how Lutherans have historically have approached the Bible.

[The website](https://elca.org/Faith/ELCA-Teaching/Scripture-Creeds-Confessions) affirms the Creeds and Confessions, but maybe you want something more in-depth than that. If you look at ""Use of the Means of Grace"" and maybe some other downloads on [this page](https://www.elca.org/en/Resources/Worship#General) you'll see hopefully a more substantive discussion of how we understand Word and Sacrament. Another one that might interest you is the [Joint Statement on the Doctrine of Justification](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html). It was signed by the Vatican and the Lutheran World Federation, the body that the ""liberal"" Lutheran churches are members of but the LCMS is not. It seeks common ground with Catholic teaching on justification. If you're looking for more theology, [Pauline Hermeneutics](https://www.lutheranworld.org/content/resource-pauline-hermeneutics-exploring-power-gospel) might shed some light for you on how liberal theologians understand and base their conclusions on Scripture. I don't expect you to agree with much or even any of this, but I hope it can show you how the mainline Lutheran churches stand firmly in the traditions of Lutheranism and Christianity more generally, and how even for ""liberals,"" understanding and living their faith is no trivial matter."

>I do think we have different opinions on what ""different theologies"" mean. I am trying to tell you that the centrality of Scripture as a basis for all theology is what makes us different. The ELCA does not derive its theology from the Bible as the LCMS does. This is a huge difference in my opinion. For example, the ELCA goes outright against the Bible when it ordains women. As I said above, we can have a disagreement over what the Bible teaches and what to believe about it, but the it is a simple fact that we *do disagree*. There is a reason that our views on ""social issues"" are so different. And it has to do with how we approach the Bible and ultimately *theology*. 
>
>Disagreements about ""social issues"" seem to me to be disagreement about what God's Law says. How can you say that we little separate us when we have so huge disagreements on the Law?
>
>You may define things differently and say that we have the same theology because we can agree to statements from the confessions. But the foundations for those statements are completely different. It is, imo, as we we live on two different planet. 

I don't know that you've even considered, then, that people in more ""liberal"" Lutheran bodies aren't going around saying, ""We know what the Bible says, but we're just gonna ignore that."" Interpretations differ. And yes there are approaches to interpretation that differ in real ways - more liberal theologians and believers tend to put more stock in understanding historical context, conservatives in the literal words of the text - but it still seems to me that you have a rather caricatured idea of how other churches use the Bible.

The same goes for the other issues. Do you really think that other Lutheran churches teach such a different ethics that it amounts to a ""huge"" disagreement? When were gay issues and women's ordination part of the fundamental teaching of the Church? They seem to loom large today because they're hot-button issues in today's culture wars, but there's nothing fundamental about them. Seeing them as some insurmountable thing is almost shockingly short-sighted. The Church in the past has had to deal with basic questions over who Jesus is, what it means to be his child, whether God can forgive those who had renounced their faith when faced with persecution. Different planets? Because we can't agree on gay people? And so it's also tragic, this perception you have. You see others as exiles on another planet, not as children of the same God or brothers and sisters in the same Christ. 

>
>With the conservative Presbyterians, for example, we at least have a foundation in common. The reason I view us as being closer to conservative Presbyterians is simply because we share this common foundation. 
>

Yet those Presbyterians have much bigger differences from you in the way that they interpret many key teachings from the Bible. Why are those big differences so much easier to get past? I suggest it's because you see them as sitting on the same ""side"" in the ever-present political fights of today. It's easier to overlook disagreements with those you perceive as ""allies.""

I'd challenge you to visit a different Lutheran church. If you ignore obvious things like the sign on the door and the gender of the pastor, I think you'll find that things are a lot more familiar than you expect. ""Completely different theologies""... either you have a very different understanding of what that word means, or else you really aren't familiar with other churches. All Lutheran churches affirm the ecumenical creeds. All preach justification by faith alone. All administer the sacraments confident that through them God comes to us. They're Lutheran churches for all these reasons. If you didn't know that, it's because we have allowed our society's culture wars to infect the way our churches relate to one another."

Moving from one to the other did not involve changing a single thing about my church's theology. What's different comes down to politics, social issues. Gender issues, gay issues, the level of involvement with Christian groups outside our own, the problems in the world that people focus more on. I understand that politics and religion affect each other - it's always been that way - but I don't like the way that Christians today give politics the driver's seat, as it were. It's sad to me when Lutherans who believe almost exactly the same things about God can't even see their commonalities because of disagreements over politics."
