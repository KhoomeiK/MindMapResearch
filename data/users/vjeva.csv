The same goes in being a top class athlete, it's a lot of work, don't get me wrong. The point is being very skilfull with a ball will probably bring you more fortune than being very skillful in physics."

todayilearned,feyrasm,t1_feypnaq,1579449683.0,"Haha no problem. The first one (Kamikaze Go-Go) was indeed the first one i America, but there is one famous photo of Helen Keller with a Akita that was pretty much shared at that time through the newspapers and gained the proper attention of the dog breed at that time, and on that famous picture is the second Akita Kenzan-Go."
todayilearned,feyliwd,t1_feyjbt8,1579447203.0,"Yeah. Sorry about that it really does sound a bit confusing and it's a shame that I am not able to edit it. It means that Helen Keller introduced the first two Akita dogs in America. Her first Akita died as a puppy (was just over 7 month old), then she basically received a another one called Kenzan-Go (she called him Go-Go)"

Filmmakers,feshfsk,t3_eqig47,1579365162.0,To be honest. It was shoot and edited in a timeframe of barely two hours. I was playing around a bit and came up with the story spontanously. I would like to invest a bit more time in filmmaking and in equipment. I would appreciate to receive somekind of feedback. Thank you all!

Filmmakers,fernsk1,t3_eqgmkq,1579356243.0,It's also one of the most memorable movies I ever saw. Especially if you take in consideration the POV style of filming. One of the most interesting facts about this movie is that your eye adopts to the main characters blinking rate that goes throughout the whole movie. Would like to hear your opinion about this as well.
