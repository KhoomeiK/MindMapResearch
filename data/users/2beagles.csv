PublicFreakout,ff450iq,t1_ff3vhbu,1579555677.0,I was play fighting with kids I was babysitting. We heard a huge thump and looked to see their Great Dane throwing herself against the glass door trying to get to me to protect her babies. We stopped wrestling and left her in the yard until the parents returned so my throat didn't get ripped out!

relationships,fe296p0,t3_enmvmo,1578835867.0,"Are you dating people you are intensely attracted to? I think that's the feeling we are told is ""romantic love"".

 I'm extraordinarily fortunate in my husband, who I still feel that lustful obsessive crush feeling for, since I was 16. I also have those depths of companionship, shared life, appreciation, respect, and almost obligation to care for him- like if he had a traumatic brain injury, I'd be taking care of him, without question. However, we always have and always will fight. We've certainly hurt each other, often. We're getting better at things. But it's been more than 25 years, to give you a picture of the work. 

Once, when we were broken up for almost a year or many years ago, I did have another serious relationship. We were more compatible, and I felt everything BUT that intense attraction. It wasn't enough for me. And of course, I had my husband (then ex bf) around to provide a contrast. I think if I were older and ready and more mature, I could have had a happy marriage with second guy. Maybe. Maybe that feeling wouldn't have been enough to carry me through. Maybe I wouldn't be as focused on him as marriage needs?? 

Anyway, all this to say- the feelings you seem to be having are what a relationship is really built on. That's where the happiness is. You can need and want the passion and attraction too. Don't mistake that for more ""real"", or what love really is. It is fun, though. It keeps me going when I'm otherwise furious with him for something."
antiMLM,fdth8qn,t3_en08pu,1578716727.0,"There's something called ""scent killer"" you can find in hunting supplies. Do not get a ""masking"" one or you'll  wind up with something smelling like old leaves and dirt. It's like a stronger version of Febreeze but it doesn't have the flowery overlay. You can spray it wherever you need. Also, you can put some on your upper lip. I've used it when having to deal with some bad odor situations (I'm a social worker- it can get really really bad). A little will go a long way. 

Drawback is that once you use it, you're not going to be able to taste food at all for a few hours. Good luck!!"
AmItheAsshole,fdr0ql7,t1_fdqmxcx,1578677881.0,"So? It's OPs mom, not a random acquaintance. Out of absolutely everyone on that planet, shouldn't your mom be the person you can count on to act like your birthday is incredibly important?"
AmItheAsshole,fdr00ag,t1_fdqifnc,1578677695.0,"I do. I'm 42. My actual birthday is for my family. Weekends nearby are friend celebrations. My mother makes me birthday pie! The day is the anniversary of our relationship. I started my life with my parents, and I won't have them forever. I can't imagine my daughter's birthday not always being precious to me. I wouldn't want to dilute my attention to her on that day, ever.
Edit: to be clear, I really don't expect my birthday to be important to much of anyone else. Except my parents. I completely expect to be told of the day I was born and how much they love me on like every single birthday. I swear I am a fully independent functioning adult. I still want my mom and dad to show me how special I am to them one day a year. And I don't even want presents. Except attention. And birthday pie."
AmItheAsshole,fdqhufv,t1_fdqh0q9,1578667044.0,"That's a narrow vision. Would you want to never celebrate your birthday with your mom again? Or to have her, on your birthday from now on, be mostly focused on someone else? OP doesn't need to be selfish for that to feel bad. NTA"
JustNoSO,fdniles,t1_fdmwnmq,1578586568.0,"Marriage and love are different things. Do you want to wait things out until you both get a bit older? Do you need to address your goals much sooner? If you do, yes, you should end things. It's not about an ultimatum. It's a life incompatibility. Those suck. And you don't want him agreeing to a kid he doesn't really want yet, or ever. Perhaps some short term couples therapy will help clarify things for you both?"

I don't really care about sweet, and I do not like artificial sweeteners, but my husband has tried a few flavors and likes them. On a busy morning, I mix the powder, some almond or coconut milk, and chia seeds. Less than 300 calories and lasts me until lunch."
AmItheAsshole,fdj79ft,t1_fdiviti,1578460439.0,"OP, you can't be the first person to be in this situation. Can you get in touch with your local Planned Parenthood? I hope they can provide you with referrals to someone who can help you sort through this, including your local laws. I suggest you ask about an abortion doula as well, either way you wind up going. Personally, I understand exactly why you no longer want to have this pregnancy. It's absolutely not what you planned and wanted. Nothing about your future is, at this point. Get support to find your best way through."

It's days or weeks, and not many of those. She may miss her legal window, certainly. He's not hanging on to the end to see the baby. That's almost a cruel fantasy. From what she described, this is a short, brutal death. Nothing like older people, or less aggressive cancers."

LifeProTips,fdgvlcs,t1_fdg0aix,1578409421.0,"I feel so strongly about that. My kiddo had hers done earlier than I would have chosen (7th birthday) but that was after 6 months of asking and being clear it's what she wanted. She's a responsible kid about cleanliness. Still, I reviewed it with her doctor and also researched to find the best place in our area. Even the man who did it (covered in tats and piercings himself) said out of her hearing he only pierces kids with their explicit consent. He reviewed the aftercare with her, showed her the equipment, had her pick her earrings, and made sure this is what SHE wanted. It's her body. I have no rights to make choices about it beyond health and safety."
LifeProTips,fdfahii,t1_fdf9cri,1578357111.0,"Of course there are coincidences. Constantly. Every single time I breath, a wave breaks somewhere on earth. Each time I personally blink, an insect dies somewhere on earth. There is absolutely no connection whatsoever. 

In this case, the implication is that spending lots of money on a wedding somehow has a causational factor in divorce. It is just as likely, and more logical, to think that to have lots of money to spend on a wedding may mean better established finances, older couples, financially stable supportive families, etc., all of which make divorce a less risky option when a marriage goes badly. Being able to afford a more expensive wedding and also being able to afford a divorce are potentially results of the same cause, without having a causal relationship with each other."

I had to take someone to an ER once who had entirely covered himself in sharpie (mentally ill guy) except for a small area on his back he couldn't reach. The nurses pulled out sunblock and said it was what they use for this stuff. Who knew?
