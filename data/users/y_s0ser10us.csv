InsanePeopleQuora,ff97r73,t1_ff94bdp,1579706809.0,"Well a few years back, we had this regular customer in the Chinese restaurant I was working at. He might be a bit weird, but I think he was pretty cool, worked oversea until retire and he even brought he’s beloved car back from oversea with him. BUT he was obsessive with Asian ladies... And he is a bit of introver, not exactly a ladies’ man. There was a time he really liked one of my colleague (now come think of it that might be the reason he was our regular customer..). Asked for her number, and tried to ask her out, both got rejected, then my colleague had been actively avoiding him because he clearly doesn’t take no for an answer. Until the day she moved on to another job, he was so upset that he questioned me in Facebook (yeah big mistake, don’t ask) why she left the job. I don’t think I bothered replying his message afterward.

Seriously he was a pretty cool guy to chat with, but he creeps me out after that. Not as extreme as your screen shot but surely reminded me of him."

FunnyandSad,fdxgi3d,t1_fdq0e7c,1578768488.0,"TIL I never knew how they works. Thank you. Now knowing this I still think the way they are working on people is tasteless if not disgusting. They use very manipulative language and try to guilt trip people into giving them money. 

That one time I gave them my details and debit card, I did not do that on my consent, I was basically dragged along by their amazing delivery of the story and gave them the card on their commands. No, no one _forced_ me or anything, but I feel like they didn’t give me a chance to refuse as I did not have a chance to digest anything they said, and their non-stopping quick-firing of facts and stories made sure of that, and that is why I think this is sickening.

What made matters worse is I got their calls 3 or 4 years after that single incident. I had to verbally tell them to stop forking calling me anymore as I have no intention to participate in anything that they had on their mind, because clearly telling them “no I am not interested” multiple times was not enough.

I have absolutely no beef towards you, not someone who’s willing to uncovers the truth. But put it PG13, I just never have any pleasant experience with them."
