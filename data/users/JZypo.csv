rust,ff8uzwq,t1_feuk865,1579697011.0,"That is a very good question. I guess it is really up to the developer - does he want the users of his api to handle for every single setter, or does he want the users of his api to handle once at the end of building.  I think I'm SLIGHTLY inclined to your method even though (in my mind) it doesn't look as sugary (but I'm a sucker for functionality)."
selfimprovement,ff3828g,t3_erbhwv,1579535899.0,Yes - take yourself out of your comfort zone EVERY DAY (start with very small things like saying hi to a stranger). Goodbye fear!
selfimprovement,ff37y7t,t3_er2zbn,1579535826.0,"Hi! You said you are ""hoping"" to have this schedule. From personal experience, If you are just starting this schedule, I would recommend only doing one new thing at a time. Only add ONE thing to the list. At a minimum, wait 10 days before anything else. In an ideal world, wait until you feel that your habit is stable (14-21 days).  Make sure you use a habit tracking system. Willpower is overrated - habits are key!

The other problem I see is that you have firm times for everything that you do. This has pros and cons.  By having firm times to do anything, you miss out on the flexibility of LIFE. There is so much more to life than what you have written down. Go out and see things in your neighborhood or your town! Do something new each day!

You were happy last year because you had a routine that felt productive. IMO, Your morning routine is the most important thing that you need to do for your happiness! 

Also - 7.5 hours of sleep. Will that be enough for you?"

selfimprovement,fegj13k,t3_eorjje,1579094272.0,"For those who care, the best way to integrate these things into your life is one baby step at a time :).

Here is my personal addendum for those who are interested...

 1. Be Generous to others - do something EVERY DAY that is correlated toward giving. Did you give knowledge that was coveted? Did you do 3 minutes of planning for someones birthday 3 months from now? Did you order them a sticker that has to do with a passion of theirs? 

2. Accept others how they are. - I must admit - this is actually a weak spot of mine. People always want to improve on SOMETHING. I like to give them nudges in the direction they want to go. Sometimes they stagnate. I don't settle for mediocrity, and I don't settle for my friends and associates being mediocre either. Hopefully I will change this in the future. If you like my way of thinking (possibly wrong lol) you can create a daily habit for this by sending a text to a friend asking them how they are coming along with an aspect of their life. Start with your heart :)

3. Cut out negative people in your life  - Jim Rohn says to spend major time with major people, and minor time with minor people.  You are the average of the 5 people that you spend the most time with.  This is actually a character change for yourself. A character change means monitoring the decisions you make. Are the decisions you make aligned with the person you want to be? If you want to spend minor time with minor people, will you find plans already with a non-negative person?  Make a habit every decision you make to say to yourself, ""What would the amazing version of myself do in this situation?""

 4. Eliminate negative media in your life.  One of the best ways to eliminate negative media from your life is to unsubscribe to /r/politics! Go ahead - do it now! It is so magical how you will feel when you purge that part of your life!

5. Wake up early. Some people MIGHT want to do this. Because I have not practiced this, I do not have any expert opinion on this. Sorry :(

6. Do something new.  Make it a habit for yourself to try something new every day - even if it is small! I love OP's ideas for trying a new meal! (it is harder than you think lol)

7-8.  Be kind to yourself.  This is hard. This requires a new philosophy entirely. All those flashbacks you have where you have been in an awkward situation... yeah, you are supposed to learn from those. Next time you think about a flashback, ask yourself, ""What have I never seen in this flashback before? What is everyone else REALLY thinking?"" Learn from your flashbacks over and over again! How would you do things different? If you were in the other persons shoes, why did they say what they did? YOUR PAST EXISTS FOR A REASON - DO NOT IGNORE IT! LEARN FROM IT. BAD THINGS HAPPEN SO THAT YOU CAN RELATE TO OTHERS! YOU CAN BE THEIR SAVING GRACE!

9.  Learn how to say NO. I'm not so skilled at this - I wish I can help more. I'm more of a ""yes"" guy myself.

10.  Acknowledge yourself.  Just before you go to bed, EVERY NIGHT - journal. Absorb the feelings, thoughts, colors, sounds of the day! Reflect on the wonder of it all. Write things that you are thankful for! What did you do that was new today? What did you not do that you should have? What would have made the day more of a success? This journal will be your treasure! It is something that money will never ever be able to buy for you!"

ABSOLUTELY! I would LOVE to help you out with anything I can! That is the person that I would like to be!

To  start: Read The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy - don't worry about  spending money on books - they are the most important thing to spend  money on (imo).

The Compound Effect will get you started on realizing the appreciation for the daily tasks that you do.

How  it helped me: I started reading. A year later, I realized how much  these books actually helped me. I became a person who helped others  rather than getting what I thought I deserved. By putting others first,  my income and job title skyrocketed! I am currently a person who helps  others and tries new things. I experiment. I realize that I am still  young, and I try things that will help me in the future - I learn from  them. Books taught me about creativity in the workplace. I now have the  philosophy that work does not exist JUST to pay the bills - work exists  so that you can become a MUCH better person in the future.

Remember that - work exists so that you can become a much better person in the future!

Other than that, go to goodreads and read all the books that are the most recommended. Anything over 4.35 rating and over 1000 reviews is an excellent choice!

If  you need someone to personally assist you in your self-development,  send me a private message with your largest problems! I would love to  help!"

selfimprovement,fc68xj2,t1_fc5qrkf,1577474994.0,"The habit of creating habits IS my favorite habit. From what I have read from James Clear, there is 21 days before there is diminishing returns on a habits strength (hence a new habit every 3 weeks). I did find it to be a good amount of time to let a single habit to build prior to moving on to creating another habit. This is a weird habit, because as I have it working now, it only works for daily habits. I would love to hear from someone else who has a perspective on strengthening habits that are weekly, monthly, yearly, or per instance.

&#x200B;

Here are some things that I have learned, or that I do for the habit of creating habits:

1. I have a habit called ""pending habit""... My pending habit is the most recent habit that I am trying to make work. Every day I will check this box on my app if I accomplished my ""current habit"". This is in addition to checking my current habit. That means that if I fail this habit for the day, I actually lose out on 2 checkboxes!
2. I use autosuggestion. Autosuggestion has been introduced to me by Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich. It means that if you tell yourself, or are introduced to something enough, you will start believing what you tell yourself. It is EXTREMELY POWERFUL! I have a habit of telling myself ""I am a habit creator. I will create a new habit every 3 weeks. If I fail to do a habit, I will strive to do everything that I can to get back on the right path. I have no other choice. This is who I am.""  Imagine telling yourself that every day! I do. It works. It keeps me on track. I think the words help, but what REALLY helps is that I have identified myself as a habit creator for half a year now, and by default autosuggested myself onto a successful path!
3. I have learned that the HARDEST time to create a habit is the first day. Sometimes the 21st day just sneaks up on me.
4. Sometimes my habits are not well defined, but I have a rough idea of what I want out of them. For example: The habit I'm currently focused on is ""Request something big from someone"". I created this habit because I could literally pick out any one of my friends/colleagues/acquaintances and there is ALWAYS something I want from them - usually to their benefit.  I wanted to tailor my environment. Well - this was VERY hard to do. I had to change the habit to ""Request or insinuate a change in someone"". The goal is not to GET what you want - it is to MAKE AN ATTEMPT. If you keep with a habit such as this one, what could you hope to get after 3 years?
5. I have a queue system.  This system of habit creation is literally EXCELLENT. If there is someone that I want to be in this world - an artist, a public speaker, a CEO... literally ANYTHING that I read in a book, I just add the habit to the ""queue"", and I know that one day I will get there! It was VERY easy to come up with the next 5 years of habits for my queue. I mostly ignore them, but they exist just in the case I want them.
6. I have come up with the realization that I need to prioritize my weaknesses. If you diet is your weakness, prioritize a habit such as exercise in your queue. If your spirituality is your weakness, prioritize prayer time. If you have trouble with communication, add communication higher in your queue. Build up your weaknesses!"
selfimprovement,fc5blj0,t3_eg1f2j,1577452308.0,"1. Reading personal development books.  Reading is the ROOT of all success and happiness!  It is the central CORE of personal development.  It is the SPARK that ignites the flame.  Do NOT let ANY more time go by without building reading into your DAILY routine.  Start with The Compound Effect (Darren Hardy). TRACK the habit of reading daily. (I use Loop habit tracker on Android).
2. The habit of habit creation.  I create a new tracked habit every 3 weeks (as of early June 2019). Monday I will start exercising before my shower every morning.
3. Listening. When speaking with others, I listen and respond 10x better than I used to. I tilt my head, I mirror, I make an attempt to understand.  Read Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss to understand negotiation/listening/empathy better. This has provided INCREDIBLE RESULTS!
4. Status Update to my Boss. Every 2 weeks, I provide a status update to my boss. It has LITERALLY WORKED MIRACLES!!!
5. Become a person who HELPS people (especially around the office). First, ask them what they need. Second. Help them. It's that easy! You eventually get a reputation for being able to get things done! A REPUTATION of getting things done is MORE IMPORTANT than the actual ability to get things done. Think to yourself: Are you a stakeholder in the actual results, or are you a stakeholder in the perception of effort?"

BTW, if you are trying to do custom messages over url, protobuf doesn't use printable characters when it does its encoding. To get around this, it may be worth your time to encode your protobuf binary messages over base64.  Also, be careful when it comes to cybersecurity. Someone could easily (really easily) ""spoof"" url/protobuf encoded messages."
