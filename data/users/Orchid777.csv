ClimateActionPlan,fcler3r,t1_fckj6ae,1577746101.0,"Technically the boiling point is the point where the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure.

You can increase the vapor pressure by heating the liquid, or you can lower the atmosphere of pressure by pulling a (partial) vacuum. 

At standard temp (25C) water has some vapor pressure which is why it slowly evaporates.  

You can theoretically slowly turn salt water into clean water by putting it in a (warm 25C+) pipe and move air through the pipe to a colder section where the clean water vapor condenses into liquid .

The rate is the real issue.

In a survival situation you can use a hole in the ground filled with ""bad"" water and a clean plastic tarp covering it will slowly allow the vapor to condense and drip into a collection container.

The real issue is providing enough water for a village. A single person would need a large surface area of slowly evaporating water and a village would need a huge surface area of slowly evaporating water. Or a lot of heat.

But heat in Africa seems to be in abundance, which makes me think mirrors and a heat collector might be an alternative. 

Solar panels are at the point where they are almost cheaper and definitely more compact solution than using heat, but if cost is the main factor then mirrors and heat collection might make sense .

Edit-

With a high concentration of dissolved solids (high salinity) the more heat you need to increase the vapor pressure. So it takes more energy to evaporate salt water than it does to evaporate pure water.

Also you can cool the water and reduce the salinity because colder water has less ability to keep dissolved solids in solution, but again it takes energy to do that.

In theory you can use gravity alone to power the entire thing, but in that case you can set up a hydro power plant and make electricity to use reverse osmosis...
