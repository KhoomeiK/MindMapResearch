Yeah they went to Goddard and trey's thesis was called ""The man who stepped into yesterday."" A lot of the songs in the thesis (which was basically an album that told a story) are some of their most popular songs today and they wrote more songs that tie into the whole thing. Their whole story is pretty awesome, I'm just glad they got back together and seem to be in it for the long run."

I'm honestly not sure about how advanced their monitoring systems are, it just seems like they have a pretty tight grip on it based on the reports of censorship and people being imprisoned for posting things."
phish,ffpo5ca,t1_ffotpku,1580100075.0,"It's kind of interesting actually. The whole 1/2/3.0 era descriptions does a pretty good job of labeling the evolution of their music. Even though people complain about the cheesy lyrics of the newer songs, the entire 3.0 era makes it seem like the band as a whole is just happier and enjoying life. Idk, I think about it sometimes when I go through the catalogue of shows and to me, it's another thing I really appreciate about them. It makes it feel more authentic or something."
Drugs,ffpn0bn,t1_ffpml6v,1580099148.0,"They dont take themselves too seriously which is one of the things I love about them. Plus they're all just ridiculously good musicians that have been together forever (they can actually communicate where a jam will go through cues in music). Yeah, a phish show on acid is a peak drug experience I always recommend to people.

Edit: Also, they've been around since the early 80s and have said they plan to continue to tour for a while. Even though they're only in their 50s, I still worry that they might break up/stop touring again and I wont get to see another live show (PTSD from the first time they did i guess). Tickets aren't too expensive and they just posted their summer tour dates which pretty much includes the entire country. If you like live music, I guarantee you will enjoy seeing them play."

It's the perfect thing to get hyper focused on for hours at a time (as meth frequently facilitates with any activity). Its the only time I ever use meth ignoring a couple day binge afterwards until I run out and am sick of it for a while.
kratom,ffmqaqo,t1_ffmjrvr,1580057862.0,"We can agree to disagree. Like I said, I'm not saying there should be drug stores on every corner like there are liquor stores. Just that a huge part of the dangers of illegal drugs are due to the fact that they are illegal and unregulated. Consistent dosing and getting out dangerous cuts from hard drugs would make then infinitely safer than what we have now. Plus there's billions of dollars being funneled to the black market fueling violence, human trafficking, etc. 

It's alright if we disagree with the idea that adults should have the choice to do drugs if we want to. My point is the war on drugs has been a massive waste of money and failed miserably in pretty much every possible way. Education and access to proper mental health care would be a huge step up from what we're doing now. Its been 40 years since they declared the war on drugs, what has it accomplished? Drugs are more accessible than ever and now dangerous substances are killing people because they believed they were getting something else."
kratom,ffmi8zk,t1_ffmgxw6,1580055064.0,"Yes, I am saying every drug should be legal. Not that it should be sold at every store in the world, just that making it illegal is not the right answer. It's not really relevant to the argument, but PCP isnt much different than ketamine which has plenty of medicinal uses. The news stories about people being violent were over blown and that's not really a good argument anyway considering people get drunk and fight all the time."

kratom,ffmfwcw,t1_ffmdini,1580054123.0,Because people use it anyway. Making something illegal makes it more dangerous for the people that want to use it anyway. People might not go crazy if they actually knew the dosage they were getting when using it. Prohibition doesnt work. PCP isnt really different than other dissociatives anyway. It just became a huge media focus when it was at the height of its use which coincidentally was when the war on drugs was getting started.

It mostly comes down to money for them I think, their main argument is always ""why should we have to pay for everyone's health care"" or something like that. Like, my dad taught me how to thoroughly research things and make decisions about the validity of sources (on the internet specifically), yet he doesn't believe in universal healthcare despite the countless examples of it working better and costing less than what we have here. The propaganda is some seriously powerful stuff I guess."

Looking back now though, I was really struggling with coming to terms with being gay at the time, and my sister introduced me to crack.

I pretty much wasted a bunch of money to party and skip classes at my first college. The 5-6 years after I left were filled with a bunch of shitty jobs, drug addictions, and pretty bad mental health issues. I'm in a pretty unique situation though, and I recognize that I am lucky (despite all the bullshit I went through) to have another opportunity to finish school. Engineering though, that's rough. I'm definitely also lucky to have known for a long time that I wanted to study computer science (and that you can make good money with it). Good luck though, it's tough when you're around that age.

Drugs,ffgr7ix,t3_etdvjf,1579912994.0,"So me and my roommate were up all night doing combo lines of focalin and a-pvp (i think, it was one of those early pv stims) and also smoking copious amounts of weed while fiendishly playing battlefield 3. This girl that I had known since middle school hit me up that I told all my friends I was into (I hadn't come to terms with being gay yet) so I told her to come over. She had the impression that I was into her as well so she invited me back to her place. So I ran inside my apartment real quick and did a huge line of that a-pvp and told my roommate I was going to her place. She was drunk at the time, and I was trying to play it off like I was actually into her (side note: that shit can really fuck your head up if you dont accept your true sexuality). Now a combination of a lot of stims and the fact that I am not attracted to women meant that my dick didnt budge when the time came. I ate her out anyway and left feeling pretty defeated. 

So i got home and my roommate was still playing battlefield and doing lines which I promptly started back at. We decided to go to the liquor store when it opened at 10am and got a handle of Red Stag which we went back home and drank way too fast. So we hadn't slept, were doing a lot of stims, smoking a lot of weed, and split a handle. We were pretty fucked up. For some reason (I dont quite remember why but I know I still wasn't in a good head space) I randomly remembered that we had 3 tabs of good acid in our freezer and grabbed them for us to split. In retrospect it was a dumb decision because we were trying to come down from the a-pvp so we could sleep eventually (and we ran out of it anyway). We took the tabs and were waiting for them to kick in, and that's the last thing I remember. I passed out and woke up like 45 mins later tripping really hard. All I remember was waking up and not being able to see anything. I got stuck in the craziest time loop that I have ever experienced where I kept saying to my roommate that we had to go to sleep, which he kept reminding me that we just took acid, that was not happening. I literally couldnt process what I was seeing, all I could see were vague blotches of colors (in this case it was that blue tint that battlefield 3 had). After being stuck in that time loop for 30 mins, my brain started putting itself back together. The first shape I recognized was the circle that was on the tv when my roommate scoped in with a sniper. I watched my brain start recognizing different objects one at a time. 

Eventually we walked to our friends house and got some etizolam and had a pretty chill rest of the trip, but it was some bad decision making for sure. Probably not the dumbest thing I have done on drugs, but it was really cool to see how much visual processing our brains are doing constantly by seeing what it looked like without any processing at all."

I pretty much only ever get meth when I'm doing a long fuck-session with this dude I know."
Stims,ffgcr0t,t3_et7403,1579903349.0,Does anyone else always get a slight burn when IVing meth? I'm pretty damn experienced with IV drugs and I pretty much never miss. If i do a big shot of meth it will burn no matter what and I'm definitely not missing. Is it just the small amount that leaks back out or something?
researchchemicals,ffgcfce,t1_ffcf5u0,1579903148.0,I get that with meth even if I dont miss at all. I've noticed more blood will leak out after I pull out the syringe compared to heroin or coke. I guess it's impossible to completely avoid some residue getting outside the vein either from it being on the needle tip or just small amounts leaking out when you pull it out.
Stims,ffgbfnd,t1_ffckvd7,1579902544.0,"Interesting, I feel like meth can get me to the right level without the anxiety that a comparable dose of adderall would bring. I feel like the meth comedown is a lot less tweaky than an adderall comedown (but I would have to take more adderall to get to a similar level so I suspect this has something to do with it)."
Stims,ffg9pax,t1_ffelm5f,1579901483.0,"Interestingly, I used to hate the word fag until I came out as gay. Now I revel in it being said lol."
Stims,ffg98nj,t1_fffn7lg,1579901198.0,I always just end up realizing how nasty my hair feels because I go through periods of sweating heavy.
Stims,ffg8x3d,t3_etbhjt,1579901000.0,"I never knew where to get any until I met a dude on grindr (its apparently not very common outside the gay scene here) that had a shit load. I smoked a bunch and had the best sex of my life for like 5 hours straight. It just felt like a stronger, more euphoric version of adderall to me I guess, but smoking it was definitely a lot more fiendish."
Stims,ffg8inc,t3_et7jd0,1579900754.0,How much is that?
Stims,ffg7nq8,t1_ffg0y69,1579900222.0,"It's nice to actually have adhd (actually I take that back, it sucks most of the time) because if I'm not binging and taking crazy doses I pretty much act better than I do when I'm sober. But yea, pupils is something you cant really hide. I've noticed sometimes I dont get huge pupils even taking the same doses of the same batch. Nobody has ever said anything to me anyway."
Drugs,ffg71as,t1_ffg3vmy,1579899836.0,Yeah you get like one or two highs that are close to what they used to be. Tolerance seems to return much faster if you have ever been a heavy user.
Drugs,ffg6io9,t1_fff9p7i,1579899515.0,Grinding out zulrah was the move when I was playing a couple years ago. Easy once you get it down and you dont risk losing your items.
Drugs,ffg6be4,t1_ffepu78,1579899389.0,"I was literally about to make the same comment. I smoked crack before I tried heroin and started shooting up, but even railing a huge line of coke would never really get me to the place I wanted. I enjoyed the ritual of sniffing coke, but shooting it is a whole other game."
Drugs,ffg636s,t1_fff8dga,1579899249.0,Get focalin instead of ritalin. Pure d-methylphenidate and comes in the style that adderall does (capsule filled with small balls) which makes it much easier to snort if you want to.
Drugs,ffg5w1g,t1_fffggss,1579899127.0,"Plus the heat that itll bring. If someone dies from fentanyl, the cops almost always follow up on it around here (baltimore, interestingly the heroin hasn't had widespread cutting with fent around here)."
Drugs,ffg5rdu,t1_ffeeic3,1579899046.0,"Yeah there have been a few cases around here with that too. Such a shitty thing to do, like what do the people cutting it like that think is gonna happen? When people start overdosing on fentanyl the police almost always at least follow up on it now."
Android,ffg3qj1,t1_ffenqwc,1579897804.0,Yes
Android,ffek6rj,t1_ffe7mo4,1579851432.0,Damn I paid $200 to have my s8 screen repaired a couple years ago and it broke again which led me to buying a s10e because they were still charging $200. That curved screen was dangerous for me.
Stims,ffe2xhc,t1_ffdtnyb,1579835312.0,It is euphoric af if you dont do it often. There are almost no drugs that dont lose their magic with repeated use.
Android,ffe247b,t1_ffe0u5u,1579834710.0,I also dont want to pay over $1000. I felt ridiculous spending $800 on the s10e. If they can hold this kind of performance (on the hardware side) I'll gladly buy a non flagship phone.
worldnews,ffdsuc2,t1_ffclci3,1579828060.0,"Can you even eat koalas? Their entire diet is leaves that are poisonous to most animals, I'd guess that there are a couple things that our bodies wouldnt like in there."
AskReddit,ffdshxe,t1_ffc6o2m,1579827812.0,"Yeah I made the mistake of (somewhat drunkenly) speaking at my extended family's thanksgiving one year and now I'm stuck doing it every year because my grandmom and all our parents thought it was great. It's not too hard once you get talking though, it's always just the beginning that stresses me out."
Android,ffds9n3,t3_esuy80,1579827656.0,"If they don't release at least one phone in this (or next) generation that has a headphone jack, I might finally have to move away from samsung. I love the s10e, I really hope they release a similar version."
Stims,ffds0pr,t3_eswqgd,1579827490.0,The no sim notification makes this so much better somehow
phish,ffdrvok,t1_ffdrkrj,1579827397.0,Weird that they would do an indoor show but if it's a hockey arena maybe they can crank the ac and it wont be hot as fuck.
phish,ffdqtw9,t1_ffdlbc4,1579826713.0,Oh maybe. I was only ever there once so I could be wrong. So that would be the arena the hershey bears play in?
phish,ffdg38b,t1_ffdc42i,1579820139.0,"I wish they would have just stuck with merriweather for this area. The lawn at hershey is kinda shitty, bathroom lines can get pretty bad, and as you said, its smaller."
phish,ffdfmi7,t3_eszqlx,1579819863.0,No Merriweather? I could just as easily go to Hershey but merriweather is a better venue IMO.
