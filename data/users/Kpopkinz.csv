AskTeenGirls,fgmza71,t3_ezbtxk,1580934766.0,Oh my bf’s still at school and i was a early graduate this year. He hated how awkward i was with him at school like everytime i hugged him i looked so awkward and uncomfortable. He also acted different around his friends at school he was just abnormally loud and like hyper and he would pull attention to himself and im really shy so i hated it. So if you guys are comfortable by yourself it doesn’t matter. School has a way of making relationships feel awkward lmaoooo
Hypermobility,fgmyv22,t3_ez8txv,1580934558.0,I think spooning could help and being doing it that sort of position.
