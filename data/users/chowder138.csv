JapanTravel,ffne2f3,t1_ffjrk1s,1580064723.0,Yep I just got back from Japan at the beginning of this month and I was so glad I onebagged it. Judging from how many posts in that sub are about upcoming Japan trips I bet there's a ton of overlap.

JapanTravel,ffivjw1,t1_ffhwblp,1579983741.0,"Doesn't this go against the entire spirit of this sub?

At least for me, the main reason for one bagging is that I can put everything on my back. That way my hands are free for other things and my effective width isn't doubled because I'm rolling luggage around (even if it's just from the airport to the hostel). So a big, carry-on-sized backpack is great (I have the Osprey porter 46) because it's a backpack but also effectively carry-on luggage when needed.

I will never travel with rolling luggage again unless it's absolutely unavoidable. Because it sucks.

AerospaceEngineering,fez3tc3,t1_fey2io0,1579453602.0,">Nowadays women and especially young girls are told that they can whatever they want, the only limit is their imagination

The media tells them that but that's not the only voice they hear. In many places (more conservative ones) the expectation is still very much that women don't go into STEM. Majoring in Math or biology is acceptable but that's about it."
AerospaceEngineering,fez0qve,t1_fev9hng,1579452844.0,">If you think it's unfair that that women are more likely to be hired, well then imagine if you had wanted to be an engineer growing up and then were told (or had society imprint upon you) that it just wasn't something you were allowed to do.

This definitely happens and I don't disagree with you there. Diversity initiatives are good.

What I'm not convinced of is the idea that when that issue is fixed, the male:female ratio in STEM will be 1:1. Who's to say that the same proportion of women and men would naturally want to be engineers? Men and women are biologically (physically and mentally) different and it's perfectly feasible to think that they're naturally interested in different jobs. So I don't know if it would be right to use the ratio of women and men studying engineering to judge whether we've done enough. It might even out at 1:1, or maybe 1:2 or 1:3. Or maybe more women would want to be engineers than men, who knows? If we stop the initiatives when the ratio hits 1:1 we may have gone too far or not far enough.

Interested to hear your take (or anyone else's that wants to chime in).

Edit: Or maybe there's no natural preference and it only has to do with how you're raised? Hm..."

onebag,fdwjgws,t1_faq8rrs,1578759340.0,"My laundry situation ended up being a little unconventional because I made some friends in Tokyo that I went to visit in another part of the country twice. The first time was about a third of the way into the trip and the second time was 4 days near the end of the trip. They were timed well enough that I just did laundry at my friend's house both times. 

Otherwise I probably would've gone to a coin laundry. 

Honestly I think I overpacked on t-shirts. I wore shirts 2 or 3 days in a row pretty often and they never started to smell or anything (daily showers and the fact that it was never hot enough for me to sweat are a big part of that). I probably could've feasibly brought like 3 t-shirts for the whole trip and been fine.

Maybe could've brought less underwear too since I washed it in the sink/shower after every use. But it doesn't take up much space."

If you want to stay inside by yourself, then do that. But it sounds like you don't want to do that.

You sound like me in high school. I thought I was an introvert but I was actually just awkward and scared of social situations. I had to grow out of that. Actually I'm 21 and I'm still growing out of it, but I'm pretty much there now. I went from playing video games and watching movies for literally all of my spare time, to hanging out with friends and interacting with people for most of my spare time. And I'm a thousand times happier now.

I don't think you're a true introvert either because it sounds like you want to go out and be social. So figure out what's stopping you and fixing it. Live your life."

Also I wouldn't say TLOP has a gospel sound. It doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard before. It's like... futuristic. But a really abstract weird future.

JIK was pretty underwhelming and I don't think a gospel Kanye album had to be like that. There's a lot of Christian rap out there that isn't corny (I like Propaganda a lot). But JIK was actually a gospel album."
