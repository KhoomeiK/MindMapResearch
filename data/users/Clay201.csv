history,ff2wzb4,t3_er5g3w,1579527256.0,"I remember Noam Chomsky mentioning that Parks had been educated and trained by activists. He was making a larger point about organizing and mass movements. He was arguing that it's necessary for large numbers of people to work together in order to change the world, that one person - even in a leadership position - can't  do it. And that the propaganda created by the institutions which fear this change is always trying to drill into your head the opposite. 

They do this in a number of ways. First, they bury the history of activism when and where they can. Second, when they talk about political advances such as the civil Rights movement, they talk about specific individuals rather than groups. They want you to believe that you have to be a special and uniquely talented individual to make a difference. Since most of us are not, we figure we can't change anything.

They didn't slow down when they took the corner and they spun out, about 270 degrees. When they stopped, the car was perpendicular to the road, pointed at a house. I guess the driver never took his foot off the accelerator because the thing lurched forward and shot into the front yard. It did all kinds of damage to the grass.

As I recall, this is what happened: Boys kept touching the young woman non-consensualy. She did everything she could think of to get them to stop, including complaining to the administration. Nothing worked. The administration decided that she simply was not making it clear to these young men that she did not consent to the touching. In other words, it was her fault. 

So the next day, she showed up at school wearing a t-shirt with a message printed on it: ""BOYS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH ME.""

As soon as a teacher saw it, she was taken to the principal's office and suspended for being ""provocative"" or ""starting trouble"" or something like that.

Eventually, the young woman and her parents got some sort of Justice. But I'm not sure exactly what it was."

AskReddit,fctfqb5,t3_eifsmg,1577941812.0,"I was a child in the 70s. One time, my brother and I were left with a babysitter who showed us her mood ring. I was probably no more than four years old, mind you. She explained that, when the ring turned a light color, that meant she was in a happy mood. When it turned a dark color, that meant she was in an angry mood. But I misunderstood and thought that the ring color controlled her mood rather than the other way around.

Then, she offered to show us what it looked like when it turned black. To make this happen, she would just have to put it in the freezer. My brother thought this was a great idea. But according to my logic, this would magically change her mood to extreme anger.  The babysitter headed for the freezer and opened the door. Horrified, I ran upstairs to my bedroom, and hid."
hoarding,fcs8qm7,t1_fcs4h2k,1577913037.0,"He began by collecting scrap metal. Then he started collecting anything and everything that he thought might be worth more than, say, fifty cents.

He never pays for anything. This is all stuff retrieved from trash people leave on the curb for pickup. Each week, he checks the local ads for garage sales. Whatever folks don't sell on Saturday gets hauled to the street for trash pickup. Similarly, houses undergoing foreclosure and estates in probate (both of which have to be announced publicly) will usually yield curb cornucopias.  Once he knows which addresses to hit, he takes his pickup truck out and collects whatever he wants. He brings in at least one full load per week.

He's brought home VCRs, TVs, clothes, toys, paintings, dishes, electronics, books, office supplies, family photos, exercise equipment, decorations, candles, lamps, and just about anything else you can imagine. I would say that he has everything except the kitchen sink, but one time, I came home to find an actual kitchen sink lying in our driveway.  It's probably still out there somewhere, buried under a bunch of other stuff. 

In his mind, every single one of these items is worth money. That old teacup will sell for fifty cents. These VHS tapes will bring a dollar each. And he does have garage sales periodically. But he never sells even five percent of the items he has. And he's always bringing in more. 

So to him, his ""theme"" is ... stuff people threw away that's actually worth money. He figures he's making out like a bandit by grabbing it."

My father does not generally have positive relationships. He's an abusive, angry, arrogant person who lacks the ability to empathize. In his universe, there are smart people who make a lot of money and then there are a bunch of useless pieces of s\*\*\* who don't. The end. He doesn't care about anything else. He has four children.

>Does he engage in any negative behaviours to protect his hoard 

He threatened me with a knife the other day when I told him he couldn't hoard any more stuff in the kitchen.  And yeah, he'll pull stuff out of the garbage can.  Over the years, I've developed a number of strategies for making sure that, when I throw something away, it doesn't get ""recycled"".

> buying compulsively when he experiences loss 

He's a world class penny-pincher. He wears clothes he finds in other peoples' garbage. He buys the cheapest food he can. He probably eats out no more than four times per year.  You have never in your life met a human being this cheap. He doesn't even pay for the things he hoards. He retrieves them from the trash people place at the curb."

AskReddit,fcqmtk4,t3_eii5tz,1577888777.0,"On one particular Easter afternoon, when I was in my 20s, my girl friend and I packed a blanket and went to a local park.  We spread the blanket on the ground by the duck pond. There were at least a hundred other people there, doing the same thing.  Some within 20 feet of us.  It was a holiday and a Sunday, so lots of people had the day off of work and the weather was absolutely perfect.  Just cool enough to require long pants, not a cloud in the sky. 

We got comfortable. I told my girlfriend that we should go skinny-dipping in the pond.  She told me I wasn't funny. I kept on. I told her ""No, really. Come on. Let's get in the water."" She thought I had lost my mind. (Maybe worth noting: even for people in bathing suits, swimming in this pond was against the rules). I kept insisting and she kept refusing. Finally, I stood up and said, ""Well if you aren't going in, I am."" In full view of all those people, I unbuttoned my pants, and pulled down the zipper. My girlfriend panicked. She started running away. I'm not kidding. She was putting as much distance between herself and me as possible. She didn't want to get arrested along with me.

But when I slid my pants off, she saw that I had on a pair of shorts underneath them.
