Your mother obviously has anger control management issues."
intermittentfasting,fghfhm1,t1_fggh4q8,1580783656.0,Not quite. I found zero calorie concentrated surcalose. 2 drops is all it takes.
todayilearned,fghfbva,t1_fgg2jrn,1580783558.0,"Fucking Navy.... Did a root canal on me in boot camp. Still convinced that the initial treatment of a cavity was drilled too far and it was a fuck up. Didn't tell me the crown was temporary. (Like, why would I know that?) Got stationed on an Air Force base 18 months later and the AF dentists were all WTF..... They fixed me up right. Still have that crown 22 years later. 

To be fair, as a civilian one of the best dentists I ever had was prior Navy. I just got a real idiot in boot camp."
relationships,fghe72t,t1_fgg54qo,1580782855.0,"It acts as a fabric softener. I use detergent, oxyclean, baking soda, and white vinegar. I never use ""fabric softener"" anymore and my clothes are so much cleaner and smell so much better. (Detergent is fragrance free too).

The vinegar goes in the fabric softener cup so that I'm not neutralizing it and the baking soda by combining them in the wash at the start.

Edit: I have a water softener as well, so I'm not fighting hard water either."
todayilearned,fgf6tzn,t1_fgecywm,1580727609.0,"When I was in the Navy on a particular ship, no one in my shop drank coffee at the time. Our department Chief popped on to grab a cup, but of course we didn't have any. The look on his face was priceless. He decided we were all psychotic that day (not really)."
todayilearned,fgc0lot,t1_fgame48,1580667853.0,"Have had both -- that's a toss up. I wanted to die when I had influenza and felt like I might. The gastroenteritis damn near put me on an IV. The only reason they didn't was because I could sip and keep down some water.

I'd go with preferring neither"
todayilearned,fgc07da,t1_fgaihn4,1580667713.0,"Yeah I'm that person -- I respond with ""Do you mean gastroenteritis?"""
todayilearned,fgbyz4u,t1_fg9jjvk,1580667415.0,"About 15 years ago when there was a flu vaccine shortage I ended up contracting influenza. I wanted to die. I mean that literally. I remember telling my boyfriend at the time (husband now) that if I stopped breathing he should just let me go. It was awful. I make sure to get vaccinated every year and get it for my kids too. My older child contracted influenza a couple of years ago, but it was far milder most likely because she was vaccinated, but there was a mismatch that year. She still talks about how bad it was.

Influenza, real influenza, is no joke."
legaladvice,fg64lqj,t1_fg5pnld,1580553336.0,"I have a concern for her that it may not be the police calling. If he spoofed a number once, it.may be the ex.or a buddy of the ex calling to make her feel unsafe to go to the police to report this stalking."
relationships,fg3o10p,t3_ewif3q,1580485961.0,"It is okay you don't like it. I enjoy Scrabble. My husband loathes it. I play with other people.

You just need to tell him in a nice way and be accommodating within reason to letting him have time to play it without you."
relationships,fg0valo,t1_fg0v2ee,1580415719.0,"I'm in my 40s. I was and am still what is considered classically ""pretty"". I have aged very well. But let me tell you, being a 40+ year old woman in a youth obsessed culture is hard even for those with good self esteem.

It is inevitable."
relationships,fg0v0dp,t1_fg0qpk1,1580415563.0,"Nice is not kind. There is a big difference between these two things. I tell my daughter's I couldn't care less if they were nice, but I expect them to be kind.

Kind is saying the hard things when they need to be said to a loved one (respectfully). Nice is just telling people what they want to hear and going along to get along regardless of the concequences.

Your sister sounds neither kind nor nice. She is self absorbed and mean."
relationships,fg0u9ni,t1_fg0qmk1,1580415143.0,"Frankly, that isn't your job. She is unhappy. Nothing you say or do will fix it or even make it worse. Unhappy people can't be made happy except through their own actions, but they certainly can tear us down and drag us down if we let them."
relationships,fg0u2gv,t1_fg0qgnw,1580415031.0,I wonder what she'll do when her punching bag (you) is gone.
relationships,fg0tz9u,t1_fg0qbvq,1580414980.0,"She may do all that. On the other end she will be empty and hollow. It will be because she is looking for happiness externally, but you don't find happiness anywhere but within yourself."

relationships,fg0tmm6,t1_fg0pizb,1580414781.0,Extinguishing the candle of another does not make yours burn brighter is a phrase you can use with her too.
relationships,fg0thlg,t1_fg0ph60,1580414702.0,Can you imagine how insufferable she will be when her looks fade?
relationships,fg0tce6,t1_fg0ppnw,1580414622.0,The fact that she is so obtuse that she couldn't read the non-verbal cues in the room just shows how self-centered she is.
relationships,fg0t0xt,t1_ffzbmfo,1580414440.0,"I'd like to point out beauty is also subjective. A rounder face doesn't make you ""less pretty"", just a different kind of pretty."
relationships,fg0snzq,t1_ffzd4vy,1580414241.0,"You could also point out you'll always be younger. 

But seriously, she's trying to tear you down because she is insecure and jealous. Your friends stood around awkwardly because no sane person in polite company would do what your sister did.

Frankly, ugly insides like that also tend to start showing up on the outsides as we age. Just being pretty doesn't get you far in life."
antiMLM,ffzxexe,t3_evxpsj,1580395359.0,"I kinda feel like you could be one of my neighbors. She was sucked into this one at some point, don't know the details. Had a LuLaRoe entry mat on her doorstep. I admit I avoided her to avoid the MLM push. Then one day I noticed she not only quietly removed the mat, but there is a ""no solicitation"" sign in it's place now."
