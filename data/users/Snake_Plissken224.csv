PublicFreakout,fekquj5,t1_fekmhyn,1579205718.0,"Growing up in Denver in the early to mid-90s,  I was the biggest John Elway fan, had all his stuff, Jersey, books, poster everything. We had a nanny and after my mom retired out nanny went to nanny for John Elway's kids. when my folks went out of town and she was available she would babysit us (me and my brother). One weekend she was looking after us but she also had to go to the Elway's and look on them for the afternoon. so we went along and I can't stress this enough, the Elway's DID give the OK, so it was fine for my brother and I to be there. So after a few hours, John got home and I was standing by the front door waiting to leave and not doing a damn thing other than looking at some of the photos on the wall. he comes busting into the door and started yelling at me and cursing me out (mind you I was about 9 years old at the time and did not say a damn thing to him) stuff like ""who the fuck are you?"" ""get the fuck out of my house"" ""you little shit, fucking up my house"" I don't remember the exact words but that was the gist of it. and when I started crying it got worse. I left his house went home and threw all my John Elway stuff in the trash. 

It's hard to explain how I felt afterwards but imaging if Steve Irwin dropkicked your dog. that how it felt."

So i believe the min wage here now is 12$ so the tipped min wage is 8.98$. at the very least most states should take this practice up.
