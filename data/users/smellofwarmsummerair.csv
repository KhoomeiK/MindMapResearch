washingtondc,ffsfjg3,t3_euy8v7,1580180459.0,"Was her tweet through a work handle or personal handle?  That would make a difference, imo. 
Either way, no one should receive death threats.  Threat to one's job would be unfortunate from a personal handle.  
(As an aside, I hope those outraged by this are also outraged by presidential tweets.)"
