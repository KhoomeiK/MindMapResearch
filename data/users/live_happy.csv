My Mum used to bring “Frostie Paws” ‘ice cream’ to my late Dobie. 

Mum grew up absolutely terrified of dogs, but Lance (a 96 lbs. Dobe) charmed her. She’d actually *pet him*... amazing for a woman who after 19 years was still afraid of my father’s 12 lbs. Bichon! 

Please keep supporting his new addiction!"
Greyhounds,fff1t3d,t1_ffewrqe,1579873365.0,"Casually glancing, they look ok, still (not bad for 98 years!). However, if you inspect closely, they’re thread-bare. In some places, the nail heads are visible. They’re too fragile to be sanded down and re-finished.

So... saving $$$ for those awesome ceramic-but-wood-looking tiles. Those are the only things that are truly scratch-proof."
