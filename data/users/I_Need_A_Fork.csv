72. She lives in my house and if something happens to her, I will report it to the Police as well as Airbnb. Do not assault, commit battery or kill anyone. I report those violations to the Police as well.

73. You must behave well here and be reasonable, fair, kind, equitable, neat, respectful and understanding. If you break my house rules, remember that Airbnb can cancel your reservation and insist you leave at once, even in the middle of the night, which also means you can't leave a review for me, per Airbnb's rules. I have never asked Airbnb to ask a guest to leave early, although Airbnb has advised me that I can. In each dramatic situation, I elected to work with the guest to preserve their reservation. However, please don't assume you can behave badly and absolutely continue your stay. These rules are here to give me options, and one option is for Airbnb to end your reservation early.

&#x200B;

74. If you bring propane, butane or other flammable gasses here, you may store them outdoors on my back deck, so if they leak they don't have the potential to blow up the house.

&#x200B;

75. Sometimes Airbnb 'unchecks' these boxes in its software without informing hosts, such as when Instant Booking is switched off and back on, so I am adding them to the house rules to bind guests to the requirements no matter what, even error on my part. By booking here you certify you comply, and if it's later determined that you didn't, you can lose all your money and your reservation: a. Airbnb standard requirements; b. Government-issued ID - These guests have verified identities.; c. Recommendation from other hosts - These guests have traveled on Airbnb, are recommended by other hosts, and have no negative reviews.

&#x200B;

76. Don’t even leave trash on top of the refuse service garbage bins, as it's unsightly and potentially considered dumping by the City. If you have trash to dispose of, do so in the trash bin in your room or in the kitchen.

&#x200B;

77. Do not propose paying with work, volunteering or any non-money remuneration. Yes, this happens from time to time, and is time consuming and harmful to me, as I have to Decline, and Airbnb keeps track of how many times I decline. If you propose paying with non money payment, I will call Airbnb to inform them, and they will likely call you to tell you not to do that again, as they view it as stealing from them.

78. It hasn’t been used for years. The risk you will make a mistake and fill the house with smoke is too high. I don't use the fireplace either.

&#x200B;

79. There is no way I can keep track of what you said unless it's in the message thread of the person doing the booking, as Airbnb has no Search feature for messages, and I have an inbox with thousands of message threads. Furthermore, there is no mechanism to link message threads, so if you tell me you will arrive early but then your friend books instead, I will not register that you will arrive early unless the person that books also says you will arrive early. I host thousands of people, and I can't remember everything anyone says. Remember, I correspond only with the Registered Guest, so if you don't book, do not contact me about the reservation of the person that did book. Instead, ask that person to communicate with me. Sometimes, to be sweet, I will correspond with a person that is not the Registered Guest, but do not expect me to or hold me to any standard of perfection, as it's confusing trying to match up threads in my mind when Airbnb provides no way to do so.

80. The living room, dining area and living room are closed from 22:00 to 7:00. I am not required to share the public areas of my home, and can easily uncheck the access boxes inside Airbnb's software that permit access. I clean the public areas nearly constantly and I really try to keep the place clean but keeping up with thousands of guests is challenging. This policy means you may never leave a review that complains about the public areas of my house being dirty, because if you do then you are admitting you failed to uphold your end of our agreement which is for you to overlook any mess or disarray in the public areas. At best, I will vacuum the common areas one time per day, so you will see dust balls and dog hair here, as I have an active dog playing with guests and my family for hours daily. Stay somewhere less busy and more costly if you want the entire place cleaned daily. I only charge $10 total for cleaning, no matter how long your stay. That covers my cleaning just once only your room and your bathroom, and those are the only rooms you should hold to a high standard. The rest of the house you should expect to be a 5/10 on cleanliness. Your room and bathroom you can expect an 8/10, but never a 10/10, not for just $10. When you assign a numeric rating, please provide five stars if I adhere to the level of cleanliness I describe here, and do not rate me relative to more costly homes that charge much more for cleaning. I am telling you what to expect - a 5 out of 10 stars in the common areas, and 8 out of 10 stars in your room and bathroom. If I achieve this, then your assigning 5 stars is expected. If this makes you uncomfortable, you may not stay here. If you are picky about cleanliness do not stay here. This is a hostel with dozens of guests simultaneously on busy nights.

&#x200B;

81. Which rules look suitable for deletion? Most of them have some back story to them from my ten years of being an Airbnb host. As of March, Two Thousand Nineteen, my house rules are about 20% the size of the Airbnb Terms of Service, which you are supposed to read as well. The laws of San Francisco, California and the USA also apply to your stay here, and I suspect my house rules are less than One thousandth of 1% the length of those rules. Keep in mind that Airbnb will not enforce common sense on a guest. The issue must be addressed in the house rules for me to be able to act, so I must have comprehensive rules to keep your visit calm and trouble free. Without a rule on weapons a guest could bring loaded guns and set them all around the house where my toddler could fire them. Without a rule on drunkenness a guest can consume any quantity of alcohol. Without a rule on arrival times, guests can arrive anytime, even 5am. I hope you get the idea that the rules are a huge benefit of my listing, and they are why you see so many lovely reviews. I would appreciate it if you do not complain about my thoughtful, reasonable and protective house rules in a review. Instead, book somewhere else with fewer rules. You are welcome to praise my house rules and tell people how my attention to well-being and safety improved your stay. Thanks."

61. Since I have a dog and a toddler, my options are limited to immediately evict the intruders since I can’t set dangerous traps. It’s highly unlikely you’ll ever see a mouse, probably 1 in 5,000, but if you do, you should discreetly and quickly tell me about it. I don’t allow eating in the bedrooms. No guest has ever reported a mouse in a bedroom. If seeing a mouse will ruin or tarnish your stay, you must book a different place, preferable one outside of a forest. My house immediately abuts a forest that’s about six square city blocks in size, one of the largest in San Francisco. I am willing to pay you $20 if you discreetly disclose a mouse, as this is conceivable that a guest will see a mouse. I know of only one time a guest has seen a mouse here, and I’ve been a host since (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and have hosted about 5,000 guests as of early (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) In no event will you receive more than $20 from me no matter who you disclose a pest to, as I have told you to expect pests here and they are part of nature and part of the experience living here. Do not violate this rule. If this rule makes you uncomfortable in even a vague or tiny way, you are prohibited from ever booking here. My house is in an urban forest and my house has doors and windows pests can walk in through. This forest is their home and they can’t read these house rules. In no event will I ever pay you more than $50, and you are waiving your right to a larger refund from Airbnb by your mandatory agreement here. There are mice here routinely but not continuously, year after year going back as long as I have lived here. Guests let them in by leaving the patio door open, so they never can be totally evicted, as I can’t control what my guests do with the door all the time.

62. Do not sign for any packages or accept any mail, packages or the like. For example, if you are outside and a delivery person approaches you and asks you to accept a package, find me or tell them they can leave it outside my door. Do not bring inside any packages you find outside.

&#x200B;

63. I do welcome complaints delivered privately to me at any time. My home if filled with imperfections, baby toys, dog toys and numerous signs of a family living here, so please stay elsewhere if you expect a true five-star hotel experience. Do stay here if this sounds amazing, authentic and desirable. If you complain in a review about these rules, you receive an automatic lifetime ban, because you should never have booked and have proven you won’t follow my house rules.

&#x200B;

64. . If you are in a rush, you can ask me to hurry and I can complete the introduction in as few as five minutes. Do not ask me to skip sections, as I have hosted over 5,000 guests and I know that bad outcomes result from skipping sections of the introduction. Learning about the kitchen may seem unnecessary to you if you don’t plan to cook, but I require you learn about the kitchen anyway, as there are dangers within and you must know about them to stay here. If you cut me off or try to skip my introduction, you will have to leave and stay elsewhere at your own expense. The safety information I cover is a matter of life and death for my other guests and my family, and I require all my guests to participate. If you expect to check in on your own and avoid me, you must stay elsewhere.

&#x200B;

65. This means, for example, that I won't allow a group to stay here where one or more guests are under 18 but are accompanied only by people who are not their parent or legal guardian. To be clear, each person under 18 must also be accompanied by their own parent or their own legal guardian. This precludes one parent bringing a group of minors they are not related to. So, a parent can't bring their own child plus their child's minor friends.

&#x200B;

66. If you perceive a danger that you may exit out a window in your sleep, you are encouraged to discuss your fear with me so a solution can be considered to block the window, perhaps by partially boarding it up during your stay.

&#x200B;

67. If you write to me in another language, I will use online translation software to attempt to translate what you wrote to English. You assume all the risk that there could be miscommunication attributable to the automated translation that could hurt you and cost you money. In other words, I won't give you a refund if something goes wrong because of a less than accurate translation.

&#x200B;

68. This includes packing the item, driving to a shipping location, shipping the item and then driving home. If there are costs, such as for a box or postage, I charge those costs to you. Note that you give me explicit permission to fully search and evaluate anything you ask me to ship to you, and I reserve the right to refuse to ship anything. For example, if you ask me to ship something I worry might be illegal, I can simply refuse. If I have that worry, I will consult Airbnb for advice about how to handle the item, and I will describe that item to Airbnb.

&#x200B;

69. If you attempt to stay longer, you agree to allow Airbnb to void whatever reservation is associated with your presence, and you agree to depart by noon of day 20. There is no clever way around this limitation. If you become part of another guest's party, the counter still is ticking, and if you overstay, that other party will lose their reservation if you don't depart by noon on day 20. This rule is designed to prevent any person from becoming a tenant under San Francisco law, as I don't want a roommate, I want to meet thousands of travelers.

&#x200B;

70. I will return to sender any mail for you that I find in my mailbox. If a courier tries to have me sign for a package, I will refuse. You must never sign for any packages either, as you may not open the door for anyone not in your party. The issue is one of danger to me. I don't want a guest to potentially send illegal drugs here that I would then be in possession of, which could perhaps theoretically result in my house being taken by the government, so no matter how innocent your request is, please don't ask and do not send or have anything sent to my home. Instead, you can have it sent to a FedEx, UPS or US Postal Office for pickup there."

60. To avoid misunderstanding, the only way out of a fee is if you ask me in advance via the Airbnb message thread in writing, and I reply via the Airbnb message thread in writing as described in this paragraph. I don’t allow you asking me to waive certain fees, and the fees increase if you do, so check the rule for the fee first, before you ask. If you ask me to waive a fee, you acknowledge that an affirmative answer from me will include the phrase 'I waive x fee' where x is a description of the fee. This is to avoid trouble when guests ask vague or oblique questions about extra fees, perhaps hoping to receive an answer that could be argued to be a fee waiver. I don't like to read your mind as to what you are asking, and I don't like to argue after the fact about a fee. So, if you want a fee waiver, ask in writing only, for example: 'Will you waive the check-out day luggage storage fee of $5?' Then, you will know you have the fee waiver when I reply via the Airbnb message thread 'I waive the check-out day luggage storage fee of $5.' If instead you write 'Can I store my luggage here before my flight?' and I reply 'Yes' that means you are asking to store your luggage and pay the $5 fee you agreed to when you booked. I am very transparent with the fees, as they are all listed in the House Rules. Keep in mind the fees are for your benefit too, as it would be chaos here with thousands of guests, but no rules enforced with fees. I know... I tried that in the early years back in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) when I became a host. Only accept written fee waivers you receive from me in the Airbnb message thread. I do not send waivers via email or SMS Text messages, and if I appear to do so, you must ignore them as there must be a mistake. Never assume you have a fee waiver unless it's in writing in the Airbnb message thread and in the format described in this paragraph. I don't waive fees in exchange for anything you may say or do. For example, if you invite me to join you for a meal you prepare, don't think that means you can avoid paying the late fee if you arrived late. I also don't waive fees if you make up your own room, strip the beds before you leave, give me your groceries you no longer need or any other situation. In other words, you cannot exchange anything you say or do or don’t do to avoid a fee or fees you incurred, and please do not propose such a trade, even nicely, as it's awkward to decline, but I will decline. You could not ask a hotel to waive a fee because you clean up your room, and you can't ask me to waive fees either."

15. If you break this rule you forfeit your reservation at your expense. If you use Instant Book, read all your reviews prior to booking and be certain none of them contain any negative information. Even if a review says mostly nice things, any negative information disqualifies you from staying here. If you are not sure a prior review is negative enough to disqualify you, send it to me for review before you book and wait for my written OK before you book. This is a big deal, as I have had guests with poor reviews stay here and then leave me a poor review. Some people can’t be pleased and given that I have to keep a 4.8 out of 5.0 average rating to keep my Superhost status, I can’t take any chances with guests with any negative information in a prior review. This is a strict test, and even if someone writes you left their place a mess, that is enough to disqualify you from staying here. Note that if somehow you get past the Airbnb software with a negative review, you still are prohibited from staying here by this house rule, and remember, I give no refunds under any circumstances, even an error by me or by Airbnb. If you manage somehow to stay here but have a prior negative review, then you agree to not leave me a review, and if you do, you agree to write to Airbnb and point out your violation of my rules and ask them to remove it. This could happen if you book here and stay here while the review period is still running from a prior stay elsewhere. Then, the host could leave a negative review before, during or after your stay but before the review period for your stay here has ended. Thus, if I see a negative review before you arrive that didn’t exist before you booked, you hereby agree I can ask Airbnb to cancel your reservation without penalty to me, and you will reaffirm that’s OK by sending me a message saying so. If you are already here and a bad review surfaces on your account, you agree I can ask Airbnb to terminate your reservation early at no penalty to me. Thus, please behave well at all prior Airbnb accommodations in the two weeks prior to your stay here to avoid trouble.

16. Note that I may have video evidence of violations.

&#x200B;

17. If you do that you agree to pay the additional amount I would have collected before the reduction in days. You will have to pay via a third-party electronic money transfer service, Money Order, check or other method approved at the time in writing by Airbnb, Inc, if for any reason the Airbnb Resolution Center does not work. You agree to submit your payment receipt to an Airbnb ‘Case Manager’ to prove that you paid, and there will be a penalty if you refuse to pay, subject to Airbnb’s options at the time for penalizing bad guest behavior.

&#x200B;

18. There is a $20 fee for breaking this rule. The kitchen is closed from 22:00 to 7:00 and even if the door is open, you may not go inside, even for water, a glass or even for a second. You may never go into my room or the rooms of my other guests, even if they invite you in. If you go into any area you are not authorized, that is considered ‘breaking and entering’ and anything that happens or that you see or do is not disclosable in a review. I report violations to Airbnb as breaking and entering. If you go into the kitchen when it’s closed, that is breaking and entering, even if the door is open wide.

&#x200B;

19. If you don't speak up, then it may not be possible to fix the error later. The most I will pay you if there is a mistake, even my mistake, is $20, so the burden is on you to make sure you have entered the correct room.

&#x200B;

20. This fine is to limit the potential for harm to me where a customer plans to cancel and/or plans to seek a refund under the Extenuating Circumstances policy of Airbnb. The harm can happen if Airbnb or the customer take their time to cancel and/or to process an Extenuating Circumstances refund. It can take days or weeks to process an Extenuating Circumstances refund and each day my calendar is blocked means I will likely have to lower the price to resell the room you will not be using. This reduction in revenue is the explicit harm to me. To encourage you to quickly cancel, I penalize you $50 per day or fraction of a day for each extra day the reservation is blocking my calendar. I give you only one free hour to cancel once you tell me you won’t check in. So, if you tell me at noon on Wednesday you will not be here, but my calendar is not cleared until Monday, you will owe me $300 which is $50 each day for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. You promise to get this money to me by whatever means it takes consistent with Airbnb's Terms of Service, and if you must use a payment service outside of Airbnb, you will not do so without the written permission of Airbnb. You also promise to share the payment receipt with Airbnb and me to prove you paid. Here is an example of why this is needed. Say you book a room for $200 a night for a week and tell me six days before you were to arrive that you broke your leg and can’t travel. You plan to get an Extenuating Circumstances refund through Airbnb. If you apply and wait for the refund, that could take a week. That would mean I would collect nothing for your first night and I would have to sell the rest of your six nights at the last minute. I might only get $75 a night instead of $200, so collecting $300 from you doesn’t even make up the money I lost by you not cancelling. In other cases, with more time, I will resell the room for more than $50 less per night, so I will make money with the $300 fee. But on balance, $50 is reasonable and that’s what the number is for now, but I may adjust it up or down later.

&#x200B;

21. If you don’t, you'll have to cancel your reservation or alter it to make it comply, at your expense, if any. The minimum price for such a stay is $275 a night plus Airbnb fees and plus San Francisco Transit Occupancy Tax, so even if I forget to update the price, you will have to Accept an Alteration Request to increase the price, or you will be obligated to Cancel your reservation.

&#x200B;

22. Recreational cannabis can be consumed under California law, and should you choose to violate US Federal law by consuming it here, please do so only on the back deck with the house door firmly closed and without informing me, as I don’t condone violating US Law. In other words, don’t ask and don’t tell. You forfeit your reservation without refund if you violate the rules in this paragraph and are banned for life from staying here again.

&#x200B;

23. No packing bags, suitcases, using the communal areas or coming and going repeatedly. Do not wake up and get out of bed prior to 7:00. You may use the toilet at any time. Check out is from 7:00 to 12:00 (7am to 12pm). Showering is permitted from 7:00 to 24:00 (7am to midnight). Curfew is 3:00 in the morning. Please be very quiet outside and inside if you come home that late. Do not book here if a 3:00 curfew is uncomfortable for your group. Food deliveries to the house are allowed only from 9:00 to 21:00 (9am to 9pm). I live here with my wife, toddler and Border Collie dog and we make noise living our lives, except during quiet hours, so do not stay here if you plan to sleep from 9:00 to 22:00 (9am to 10pm). I build things in my workshop using power tools. It’s a busy, rambunctious environment and a lot of fun.

&#x200B;

24. Even though Airbnb discloses my phone number to you, that is for true emergencies, such as alerting me the house is on fire. Do not send me an SMS text message (via a cell phone to my phone number) or leave me a voice mail. I get so many junk calls and texts I just can't review them all looking for Airbnb related messages. You should assume I will never read any SMS text messages or listen to any voice mails you leave, and you may not complain in a review that I was unresponsive for not replying to any communication method you use that is prohibited, such as voice mails and SMS Text messages. If we do talk in a direct phone call, you must send an Airbnb message at once duplicating that call if you want it to count as an actual communication with me. Airbnb needs to be able to see the complete history of our electronic communication, and if you call me, they can't see that, so by booking here you specifically tell me to ignore anything you tell me on the phone, by SMS Text or by voice mail unless you tell me the same thing in writing in an Airbnb message sent very quickly to me, but certainly within an hour.

&#x200B;

25. If you use a 12 hour clock and there is a misunderstanding that costs you money, don't look to me for compensation, even if I make the mistake. For example, if you say you will arrive at 12pm but mean 24:00 then there is a late fee to arrive. 12pm is noon (12:00) and 12am is midnight (24:00).

11. It is allowable for you to book more than one of my rooms for the same night(s). You forfeit the reservation for any night you are not here, without refund. There are no workarounds available and you will lose lots of money as I will not assist. This is an iron-clad rule of Airbnb the company. I only repeat it here to emphasize the importance of complying. If you write negatively in a review about my mandatory enforcement of this rule, I will block you and tell Airbnb that you retaliated because I enforced their Terms of Service rule. Millions of dollars are at stake with this rule because Airbnb can withdraw its Host Guarantee if the Registered Guest does not sleep here each night. I can’t risk losing the Host Guarantee, so I enforce this rule. Despite this harsh rule, many guests violate this rule each year, so please read this rule and comply. Think of Airbnb reservations as you would a commercial airline ticket. You can’t book an airline ticket in your name and then expect the airline to allow your spouse, son, daughter or anyone else to fly. The unauthorized third-party will be refused boarding and the person that booked will lose money according to the cancellation policy of the ticket purchased. It’s the same here, the person you booked for will not be allowed to stay here and my cancellation policy will apply, so you will lose money, probably everything except the cleaning fee. As stated elsewhere, I never issue refunds, so you absolutely must never ask me for any money back. In addition, I make no effort to catch booking errors on your part, so if the Airbnb messages to me are signed with a name different from the name of the account holder, I may not notice or do anything. I have thousands and thousands of people staying here and I can’t take on the responsibility to look for mistakes in the bookings I receive. Now if I do catch something, I will bring it up, but you can’t argue with me for a refund because I didn’t catch your error. To avoid trouble, you should never share your Airbnb password with anyone or allow anyone to access your account, for example, by sharing your phone or computer. While this position may sound cruel, it’s not. It’s honorable and the only correct thing to do. I can’t give a refund because that would lower my income through no fault of my own. Even if I did issue refunds, that’s burdensome, as a refund must be deducted at tax time, and then I would have to keep track of all refunds on my own, as Airbnb doesn’t gather them in one place. I can’t allow the unregistered guest to stay because Airbnb doesn’t know who they are. In fact, Airbnb is not even allowed to talk with that person, even on speaker phone with me present. I can’t just switch the name on the reservation because Airbnb offers no way to do that, even if you call them. I can’t let the unregistered guest make a new booking, even at their own additional expense because they could penalize me, and I can’t take that risk, so all the people in the group cannot book here. Remember, Airbnb can terminate any host that falls below a 4.7 out of 5 stars, and that’s an exceedingly tight window to adhere to. Every host has to rate an A if this were a college or university. Even A- is grounds for termination per the rules of Airbnb. If I allow the unregistered guest to book, they might give me a 4 star review or worse. This might seem warranted or OK, but a 4 star review on its own is a fail and quickly brings down an average that has to be 4.8 or higher to be a SuperHost, like I am. If a guest left a 1 star review to really hurt me, it could take a year of perfect 5 star ratings to undo. Thus, everyone will have to stay elsewhere. By upholding Airbnb’s rule, I am protecting my other guests from the unknown of having an unidentified person residing in the house with them. If they stole from or assaulted anyone, I would have no name to file a police report. In addition, I share my home with my guests, so the unidentified person would have access to my wife, toddler and dog. This is not fair to my other guests and to my family, and if you violate the rule and lose your reservation and your money, I sincerely ask you to consider what I have written here and not complain to me or to Airbnb. They have enough things to do daily and listening to a guest that just broke one of the company’s most serious and far reaching rules is not likely to make them thrilled. What’s more likely is that they will flag your account and if you make another third-party booking that they learn about, I can see them removing your access to Airbnb’s services, though I have no knowledge of what they will do to repeat rule breakers. If you ask a host anywhere to bend the Airbnb rules, you are asking them to assume the full financial burden if anything goes wrong. This is dishonorable in my opinion. People are injured and die at Airbnb locations, just like they do at hotels, motels and anywhere else. But Airbnb can rescind its $ (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) insurance coverage if they learn a host admitted unregistered guests, even if they are related to a customer of Airbnb. I don’t know any hosts that are so rich they can willingly assume to pay for an injury or death, or to replace their home if an unregistered guest burns it down. Finally, do not tell me you didn’t read this rule. You are obligated by these house rules to read this material before you book and again the day before you arrive. I remind you of this obligation several times in my listing. In its Terms of Service, Airbnb also requires you read and abide by a host’s House Rules.

Other things to note

House Rule footnotes:

1. I don’t allow check in before 9:00 on the first day of your reservation. I offer ‘early arrival’ from 9:01 to 18:59 for $20 per group of people that arrive together. The ‘early arrival’ fee is triggered by the following behavior: arriving during the early arrival time frame, scheduling an arrival during the early arrival time frame, asking if you may arrive during the early arrival time frame or hinting that you will or want to arrive during the early arrival time frame. Each scenario consumes my time, thus the charge. Since even asking if you can arrive early costs money, please don’t ask. I always allow early arrival for a fee, so please just tell me when you will arrive during the early arrival time frame. Late arrival is from 21:00 to 23:59 and the price and terms are the same as early arrival. This means you should not ask if you can arrive late, because I always allow it for a fee. If you simply ask, that triggers the fee, because asking consumes my time too. I never waive early or late fees, and you may not ask any questions in that vein. If you do ask, I charge $10 just for your asking, as it’s stressful to be asked when I told you that you may not ask. You must not interpret any answer I give as a fee waiver, even if you think you hear me say I won’t charge you. The early and late fees apply no matter what, even if your plane is cancelled, your car catches fire, your luggage is lost or any other crazy situation. If there are extenuating circumstances, such as your flight being delayed, you may also check in the day after your reservation begins, and this is called next day check in. Next day check ins are very tough on me, and I often lose a day of productivity because I am so sleepy from waiting up to greet you and give you the house introduction. Thus, I charge $50 per next day check in. I cut off next day check in at 9:00 in the morning on the day after the first day of your reservation, so if you miss that deadline, you forfeit your reservation and money and will have to pay for accommodation elsewhere. Finally, many guests ask if they can drop off their luggage early but officially check in during the free check in hours. I do allow this for double the normal fee, but even with the extra money, I never want a guest to insist to just drop off luggage early. The reason is that if you only drop off your luggage, you don’t know how to get in and depart on your own because you missed my ten-minute house tour. Thus, I have to wait for you a second time to educate you about my home. To discourage this wasteful extra waiting, I charge double to just drop off luggage early. I understand there are luggage storage services you can purchase to store your luggage elsewhere if you find my fees too high. It is smart to store your luggage here or at a storage service since San Francisco is not a safe place to leave anything in your vehicle, due to the thousands of car burglaries per year here. The fees I describe here are cumulative and they apply whether I greet you or meet you or not. Occasionally I will give you the door code and written instructions. Sometimes when part of the group arrives, I will allow the rest of the group to arrive without meeting me, but that does not mean those people avoid the fees. Please don’t convince yourself a fee is not due because of something you do for me, such as feeding me, cleaning your room or giving me a gift. A hotel would not waive a fee because of something you do or something you give. I do offer early bag drop off for double the fee to accommodate true emergencies that do come up, such as a guest being late for an interview where they can’t take their luggage, but this happens perhaps twice a year.

&#x200B;

2. If you don't, you must cancel your reservation without my help. This rule is to bind guests to reading the house rules/listing and clarify that not reading the material constitutes a violation of my house rules. This rule is number 2 because guests not reading a listing is the most common source of trouble on Airbnb. Here is how quickly you must send me the statement: a) if you Instant Book you must send it concurrent with your booking or before. B) If you send a Request to book, you must send the statement before I will Accept your Request. If somehow the statement does not arrive, you must send it to me within 60 minutes or you must cancel your reservation and suffer the consequences of my cancelation policy, as I will not assist. If you don’t cancel as required, I will ask Airbnb to cancel it on your behalf citing your violation of this rule as the reason, and I will charge you $20 for the work it takes for me to call Airbnb. If somehow you send me the required statement but did not read the listing and house rules, and I figure it out, you forfeit your reservation and all the money required by my cancellation policy and you will have to check out if you have checked in. Thus, I suggest you read the rules and listing before you book and the day of your arrival, so the material is fresh in your mind. Almost every less than delightful review you see on my profile is due to a guest that didn’t read what I wrote, and I am taking action to ban such people from staying here or continuing to stay here.

&#x200B;

3. No footnote.

&#x200B;

4. There is a $50 fee if any person two years or older not counted as a paid guest on your reservation comes in the front door, even briefly, and even if they are a friend or a taxi driver helping carry your luggage. Infants and toddlers under two years old are free but still must be included in the count on the reservation. If you arrive with more people, you’ll have to add the extra people before they come indoors. I will never waive this fee, and nothing you hear me say may be used to argue your way out of the fee. For example, if I agree to allow an extra guest, that means I am agreeing to allow you to pay the $50 fee plus the normal extra guest fees. It does not mean I am waiving any fees. I consider sneaking in guests akin to leaving a restaurant without paying.

&#x200B;

5. I don’t charge you if you return the key to me before the next guests arrive, usually that day. If you find the key after the next guests check in, I prefer but don’t require you return it to me, and the $20 is due even if you do return it to me, as it causes me a lot of trouble to get a replacement key, communicate with you and to collect the fee, such that $20 is below under San Francisco Minimum Wage for my time.

&#x200B;

6. I charge at least $20 if you break this rule, but there is no limit to how high the penalty could be, to allow for damages in the case of injury or death. Thus, if you leave a gun and a child kills themselves or another with it, the normal legal process will proceed, and your financial exposure is uncapped. Another house rule prohibits weapons in my house.

10. If you think your situation deserves a refund, Airbnb occasionally grants refunds according to their Extenuating Circumstances policy. Please contact them but don’t disclose your medical condition to me, if the reason is related to a medical issue."
