worldnews,fcpztxe,t1_fcp4zqj,1577875702.0,"sorry, but we humans think way too much that we are extraordinary but we are not. einsteins theory of relativity and the brothers wright flight would have been done without them, because there is a time for inventing things and realizing new knowledge and if there has been no einstein or wright, somebody else would have done it. and to be honest, the solution is allready there: less humans. reduce the amount of people on this planet to 4 billion ( 3 billion would be much better, because we can than keep at least 30% of the planet for our fellow creatures ). doing this is also simple: do not have more than two kids. having more kids than two hurts the planet and kills nature. 

any other solution is stupid, because it only ends in more people and we will come to a situation where we have optimized everything and there are still too much people. stop producing children now. its the best for the planet and the best for us."
