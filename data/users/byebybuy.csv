Basically, they’re attempting to monetize their subreddit.

Plus, they’re shitty, unthinking, unfeeling reposters. Like, they’ll repost something with the exact same title even if it’s the wrong information. A while back they posted something gnarly and the title mentioned that it was a result of the patient having schizophrenia. People did a little research (like, just googled the thing) and quickly realized it had nothing to do with schizophrenia. Doing that kind of thing sends the wrong message about mental health. They were called out a bunch in that thread, but only radio silence on their end. They’re generally totally absentee unless they’re (a) banning people, or (b) trying to get money. They suck.
