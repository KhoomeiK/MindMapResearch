God(s) were created to keep the people who never grew up mentally behaving their whole lives so they don‚Äôt have to think got themselves.

AmItheAsshole,fcv9hap,t3_ej28ol,1577997435.0,"NTA. I almost agreed with the NAH, but the way he talked to you about it is a big red flag in my experience. I would communicate that you‚Äôre just worried you‚Äôre not enough for him and don‚Äôt want to find yourself on the worst side of a cheating scenario. How he reacts to you being vulnerable will tell you a lot, because a stable, grounded person who cares about you would reassure you and talk calmly about why there might be such an overwhelming amount of women wanting to talk to him on the app, maybe something along the lines of what has been mentioned in some of the other comments here on this post, show translations of conversations he‚Äôs had, and try and figure out how the both of you can be comfortable with which apps/methods he used to learn a new language. 


That being said, based on how defensive he got and how he blamed you for being too jealous when you simply asked him about the app, not understanding why there‚Äôs so many women talking to him, combined with the fact that you already have some doubts, I would leave. If he isn‚Äôt cheating and you still have these doubts, you have some things that you need to work on before you go into a serious relationship. BUT, if he is cheating, you don‚Äôt deserve to stay with someone who clearly doesn‚Äôt want to be in/understand the concept of a monogamous relationship. 

Always try to communicate first, but also know when and how to move on if needed."
