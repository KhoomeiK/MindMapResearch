You would have no rights to the property in court, especially if you don't have a paper trail proving you have been making payments to your parents. If you continue to live there (which, frankly, I would STRONGLY discourage), you need to be sure that you have proof that you are paying them, in case they ever get the bright idea of trying to hold over your head that YOU are living in THEIR house (which, with the way the paperwork stands, you are). I would get the hell out of dodge before you are legally bound to the property and therefore entangled with your crazy parents for the foreseeable future.

I've had some luck with wraps, summer sausage slices with cheese and crackers, vinaigrette-based pasta salads, leftover enchiladas, pulled pork,chicken, and beef with or without sauces, cold leftover baked chicken, ribs and pork chops. Although, you might not like some of those things cold, so I don't know if that would work for you. I also bake a lot and send muffins, cake, cookies and pieces of pie. He also eats lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, and mixed nuts with or without dried fruit. Beef jerky is also a common item that gets included. A wide-mouth Thermos and a heavy-duty lunchbox with a good ice pack helps a lot."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fekqdec,t3_epkfpd,1579205436.0,"I've shopped on that sort of budget for many years, it takes some work and planning, but it's do-able. Shop sales, and the clearance sections. Learn what produce is in-season (because seasonal produce is cheaper, and also tastes better). If you have an Aldi, they are fantastic for cheap staple ingredients like milk, eggs, flour sugar, beans, rice, tortillas, canned goods, etc. If you don't have an Aldi, Save-A- Lot is good(it's my favorite for meat), and even Kroger runs some good sales (I highly recommend getting a Kroger card if you can, it's free, and you get also get fuel points and coupons. Filling out their surveys nets you even more fuel points and I periodically get REALLY good coupons in the mail). Make a meal plan based around what's on sale that week. Make a list and STICK TO IT. I like to use the Kroger website to get base prices and then shop at Aldi (or whatever your discount store is) first, that way if they have the thing I'm looking for cheaper I can go ahead and get it there to save money. And I already have an idea of what my total might be, so I know if I can afford a little treat or something.

Mexican type meals and pasta are relatively cheap and I can usually stretch them into a second meal for later in the week, so I don't waste what I buy. I do a Southwest Beans and Rice casserole that's very customizable depending on what I have on-hand. Pasta salads are also good for this, and very versatile for working with whatever season it happens to be. Also breakfast for dinner is popular in my house; french toast, pancakes, eggs, oatmeal bakes (which double for good snacking later in the week) are all cheap and easy to make. Salads are our big go-to in summer, and we learned to make our own dressing, so that's something we don't have to buy anymore either.

Every week I usually boil a bunch of eggs for breakfasts and/or snacking. I bake a lot, so muffins, coffee cakes, pies etc, all get repurposed into lunchbox fodder. I like to have fresh, seasonal fruit on hand, but when that's not feasible, dried fruit is cheap (just watch the sugars) and it's especially good with mixed nuts. It's good to have seasonal veggies on hand too, for snacking or just throwing extra nutrients into a dish you're making.

It sounds like a lot, but eventually you get a system down that works for you. We've had some lean times, but we've never starved. Good luck!"
AskWomenOver30,fekedsa,t3_epltsd,1579198295.0,"Eventually you just kind of have to step back and watch the shitshow go down exactly like you knew it would.

Then they would completely ignore said advice and run headfirst into another absolute clusterfrick of a relationship. I just instituted a blanket policy, where if you ask my advice, agree with said advice, and then go and do the EXACT OPPOSITE of what we just talked about, I will no longer try to help you. I do not enjoy talking to a brick wall, nor do I enjoy repeating myself like a broken record because you keep making the exact same stupid-ass decisions.

childfree,fek0oqd,t3_epadsf,1579190098.0,"  I very much feel this. I have a friend whom I've known 20 years, just had a kid a few years ago. She used to be good at splitting the visitation between us both (I'd go see her, she'd come to see me) pretty evenly. We'd go out to concerts and do fun stuff all the time. Now, she's always pressuring me to come visit. And by visit I mean drive an hour and a half to sit in her house in her podunk town, because Jr. doesn't like car rides and she ""doesn't trust anyone to watch him"" (she had a hard time conceiving and as a result is like waaay overly attached). Dude. I live in a place where there's a ton of stuff to do, and even though I'm not that fond of kids, I would rather you bring him and we go do something than sit for hours and never do anything but have you want to show me stupid shit on TV, complain about how hard everything is while simultaneously talking about trying for ANOTHER kid, and yell at your kid/dogs. I haven't even been able to have a decent phone conversation with her in years. AND, to top it off, when she has managed to get down my way a few times for whatever reason, she's totally blown me off after getting me all hyped up about getting together :/ That hurt. I tried for a while, but I just got so tired of bearing the brunt of responsibility for our relationship. Like, I love her, but I don't really try to make plans with her anymore.

   On the flip side, I have another friend with 4 kids, who never pressures me (although we do go see them more often as her husband owns his own business AND we also have family in the area) and when we do come visit she ALWAYS goes out of her way to make some kid-free time for us to hang out together. So it CAN be done if the friend is actually a good friend."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fejn3z6,t3_ep91of,1579180442.0,"Bit late to the party, but I like using shrimp the best (although I've also used it as a vehicle for leftover chicken, beef, and bacon). I usually cook up whatever protein I'm using with butter, onions, garlic, ginger and either Chili Garlic Sauce and/or Sriracha. It would probably be good with any other kind of chili sauce or even Thai curry paste (I like a bit of spicy, nothing too overboard). Obviously since my protein is already cooked, or quick-cooking, the onions keep a good bit of crunch. Then I pretty much use everything you mentioned, and finish it with some chopped green onions.

I hit 30 last year, and my libido, and my ability to get...prepared, took a bit of a hit. I've noticed that when he does the emotional stuff I need, I'm far more likely to want to roll him in the hay, whereas before I was just throwing him a bone by initiating, even if I wasn't always really feeling it. But we had to talk about it and I really had to lay it on the line for him; that if he wanted me to meet his sexual needs (which I have too) he has to meet my emotional needs, because they are the Keys to the Kingdom, so to speak.

It also felt a little like they were rubbing in the fact that they were so well-adjusted and over our relationship(they probably weren't, but feelings are rarely rational).

If it was you, and it hasn't been very long, I maybe wouldn't because there's no way of telling if she's still trying to get over you, and it would be kind of a jerk move to reach out and reopen the wound(especially on her birthday). If she ended things because of something you did, I would also leave it alone, because she may still be mad and need space. There are some men in my life that I ended things on good terms with, whom I don't mind hearing from, and there are others that to never hear from them again would be too soon.

My sister has 2 girls and our dynamic with them is that he's the Yes Man so I have to be mean Aunt FlyingFigNewton and make sure they mind and/or don't injure themselves. It's frustrating enough then, and we get to give those children back. Having to do that day in and day out for the next 18 years would probably end with me in jail for homicide. I also have a short temper, little patience and high expectations, so...not a great fit for parenting either."
AskReddit,fdewrwl,t3_eklsip,1578348226.0,"My mom's second husband was a piece of work. Mom dated him for all of two months, and during that time he was just the coolest, nicest guy. They get married- BOOM-Douche City. He was an extremely mean drunk, who had jealousy issues and would start fights with my mom that would devolve into them just screaming at each other (mixed with her crying) all night. Their room was right next to my sister(about 6/7 at the time) and I's(13-ish) room, so it's not like we could hear them or anything /s. During the 6 months they were married, she and I spent as much time out of the house as possible. I also started sleeping with a knife under my pillow when I WAS home, because not too long into the whole ordeal, I started getting some serious creep vibes from dude. They had a fight at our grandpa's(whom we lived with at the time) work Christmas Eve party, and his extremely drunk ass insisted we all leave early and he drove. They scream-fought all that night. He also tried his damnedest to separate us from our real dad (which thankfully was impossible to do totally thanks to court-ordered visitation), by imposing all kinds of weird rules, including disallowing him to call us at the house (we had to call him). Then Mom tells me that he wants us to move to Kentucky with him, because he wants to be closer to HIS family. And she was gonna let it happen- despite the fact that she had no safety net, family, friends, or job prospects in the area, that she would be turning my sister and I upside-down, especially school-wise, that she'd be moving us away from our dad, and that the fights she and he were having were \*this\* close to him hitting her (which had we moved I guarantee would have ended up happening if it hadn't already, and I'm not 100% that it didn't). Thankfully, they ended up having a really bad fight before that happened, my grandpa tossed his ass out, and they ended up getting a divorce. Not sure what ever happened to him, but I hope his life sucks. Husband number 3 is an asshole too, and Mom actually ended up screwing me and sis over by moving us out of state with this one, but he's nowhere near as bad as this guy was. Mom has bad taste. But I'm 30 now and can choose how much I have to deal with."
AmItheAsshole,fden21e,t3_ekwiv7,1578342478.0,"NTA. Your coworkers need to mind their own business. Also, personally, I hate empty platitudes. I've lost loved ones and the LAST thing I wanted at that time was a bunch of people telling me how sorry they were, how everything would be okay, that ""they're in a better place"", and so on and so forth. All that crap made it that much harder to hold myself together, and nobody actually wanted to go deeper than surface level when they were asking if I was ok, so I had to force myself to try to seem like I was ok, which was stressful. You offered condolences in a way that didn't make it about you (which is what people do, they want you to know they're concerned so they can seem like good people). You took some crap off her plate so she didn't have to deal with it, which is one of the best things you can do for someone in mourning. And you donated $50, which is very generous, no matter what your asshole co-worker says."
AmItheAsshole,fcvcek8,t3_eiyxs8,1577999162.0,"ESH. You, for giving in to a toddler tantrum, and then being dumb enough to be truthful about Jr.'s new favorite snack. Your wife's friends are AHs for pretending like their children don't have their own...quirks. Your wife is mildly an AH for her waaaay over-the-top reaction(although with the pregnancy hormones a-flowin', you should know better than to poke the bear). And finally your kid is on their way to becoming an AH if you allow them to continue acting the way they do.  Most kids eat weird crap at some point, pet food and treats seem to be very common (my sister was a cat food gal, I liked sucking on Beggin' Strips). However, most parents try NOT to advertise the weird junk their kids like to shove in their cake holes.  Stop allowing your toddler to be a Dictator, and find a more acceptable treat for Tater Tot."
DoesAnybodyElse,fcv5urn,t3_eiuep0,1577995270.0,"Yes! I live in Ohio, and we've got an alarmingly high rate of human trafficking going on right now. I am always on high alert whenever I go out. I don't walk by myself anytime after dark. When I go for a walk during the day I have my 70+ lb. dog with me, and even then, I'll cross the street or make abrupt, unplanned detours if I think a vehicle is being suspicious. There's been a couple times where a car stopped so the owner could tell me they liked my dog, and I felt silly afterwards because I was tensed up and ready to run like hell, but I'd rather be safe than sorry."
dogs,fcrntfa,t3_eiikm3,1577904250.0,"I have a rescue dog that is weird about water too. It's been a struggle to get him to drink enough. He definitely seems to prefer cold water, so I keep bottles in the fridge and fill his bowl from those. I've found he LOVES ice cubes. I also mix 1/3 of a can of wet dog food in with his 2 meals a day to up water intake. Hope you can find some tricks that work for yours too!"
relationship_advice,fc8oibd,t1_fc5ic2o,1577539080.0,"I don't think I'm missing the point. I was replying to someone else who said in some cases if they didn't buy their SO's family gifts the SO's family doesn't get any, so they end up feeling *obligated* to buy presents for them. Like I said, if you want to take that on, cool. I personally don't think that that should be anyone else's responsibility. If you *WANT* to buy them gifts from you, that's great, do so. Personally, I do not. My husband's family is much too big, I don't know them or their tastes very well, and would hate to waste money on something they didn't like or want in the first place.Likewise, I  don't expect my husband to pick out things for my side of the family."
AmItheAsshole,fc6pqv5,t1_fc68qxr,1577486383.0,"I mean if the person doesn't know your taste very well, and they try to pick out something nice and miss, that's one thing. You can be nice about it while trying to turn their attention to stuff that is much more to your taste/style. In this case though, OP was crystal clear about what they liked and dude just went and picked something totally the opposite. That doesn't show thoughtfulness to me."
AmItheAsshole,fc5rbo2,t1_fc5ly70,1577464212.0,"I think it's most important to be grateful that they got you a gift. But if you don't like something, pretending that you do is the quickest way to ensure a lifetime of crappy, not-to-your-taste gifts. So, no, I don't think you should pretend to love everything your SO gets you. You should have enough love and trust in your relationship that you are able to (gently) redirect them to something that IS your taste, that you will love for real."
childfree,fc5gpg1,t1_fc4qvop,1577457102.0," I can understand where you're coming from. I was a server for a long  time, and I hated going through the spiel. I never minded if someone was  polite in the way they halted me from going through it. Especially if  they knew exactly what they wanted. Great, saves us all time. HOWEVER,  many times cutting off the spiel results in a ton of questions that  could have been answered had they just let me get through it. Soup of  the day? Would have been covered. Sides, veggies available? Ditto. How  much is...I could have conveyed all that information in about a minute  or so had they just been a little patient."
relationship_advice,fc5c2uy,t1_fc4tek9,1577452834.0,"Call me heartless then, because I think that even when you are married, it shouldn't automatically fall on you to buy gifts for your SO's side of the family. If you want to take that on, cool, but presumably they will still know their family's taste and whatnot better. I know a lot of husbands like to play the ""well, you're so much better at picking gifts out"" game, but heck with that. I've got enough stuff to deal with already."
AmItheAsshole,fc5b9b2,t1_fc57x5g,1577451935.0,"My husband and I got together when I was 24 and he was 38. We'd been friends for 4 years, and we had such a great connection, it just developed into more. We've been together 6 1/2 years, just officially  tied the knot in June :)"
