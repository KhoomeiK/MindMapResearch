Your post was short, so I'm not sure exactly what point you're trying to make.

I've seen it implied elsewhere that her whole trip was wasted because of this flight of the skipper.  Your use of ""OK Boomer"" suggests that you subscribe to this sort of wholesale discrediting of arguments via ad-hominem attacks.

Reading the article you linked, Greta did not plan to make that trip (at least not at that time) because the COP25 summit was supposed to be in Chile.  It was moved (at the last minute) to Portugal.  So she had to sail back across the Atlantic, at that time.

According to [her facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/nikki.henderson.sailing/posts/reflections-from-the-north-atlantic-for-what-feels-like-the-first-time-in-the-en/128310635282039/) the skipper bought carbon offsets for her flight.

When does someone become an expert player?

The sketchiest words are entered in the dictionary without a definition (""This is a valid words with friends word"").  When an opponent plays a word that seems invalid, it doesn't make it seem legit if WWF doesn't have a definition for it.

I'm glad EMO is now allowed; that was a recent addition of a fairly common term. 

Is it snobbish elitism to want to know the rules of the game you're playing?  At least Scrabble published some rules and stuck to them.  WWF is just making it up as they go.  There's no way to know if a word is accepted unless you try it (by hand) or see an opponent play it."
