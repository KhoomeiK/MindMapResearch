dankmemes,ffs6jz6,t3_et4e2g,1580174380.0,"As someone who experienced homelessness, can confirm most people on the street get comfortable with the handout lifestyle, and they stop trying. There are programs in place to help you get food for free or really inexpensive, and most 211 resources will help you get work. 
I'm fortunate enough to live in Phoenix Arizona, where it doesnt snow in the winter. The summer was miserable sure but I just worked all day, bought a tent, set it up in the dried up riverbed near my work, and within one month I had the money to get a cheap ass Altima for 2k. Lived in that for 2 months and got an apartment. Now I'm 24, engaged to my best friend, and we are about to buy our first house.
Also, I even got a gym membership while I was out there, just so I could use their showers. I realise everyone is different and has gone through their own levels of shit that I cant understand from my shoes, but if I could do it, most people out there can.
Tldr; it's not hard to get back on your feet as long as you dont get hooked on drugs or lose faith in yourself and your ability to overcome anything."

AskReddit,fehqfmr,t3_emvveb,1579121817.0,"My husband is currently out there fighting them, and both he and I can't get over the level of misinformation being spread.  A vast majority have been dry lighting strikes that have ignited, or spot fires that have taken off. The arson activity is limited and the death toll is due to freak accidents, such as the firetruck being blown over in a wind storm, or people staying to defend their property. 

Some of the comments in this thread are disgusting, these are horrific fires that have never been seen before.  Have some compassion for the suffering of others."

Young kids can’t read yet every “kids” game requires somebody to read the bubbles in order to get through the game play.  I assume the budget for such games is so much smaller that they cannot afford to pay for the voice overs. 
For kids they may as well be watching a peanuts cartoon when the mom talks in jibberish"
