Whatever “god” you believe in, don’t you think this “god” would have sent a messenger to convey his religion? Should we have a purpose? If we were created why wouldn’t we have a purpose? God does not need us at All! We need God. I am Muslim myself and I believe God sent many messengers for different time periods including Jesus, Moses, David, and Mohammad(peace be upon them all). And the Torah, Gospel, Zaboor, and Quran  were all sent by God. But the previous books were altered so God sent the Quran through Mohammed(peace and blessings of God be upon him). But this time there was no alteration as it was memorized by Mohammed(peace and blessings of God be upon him) and his companions, by those after them, and now millions have memorized the entire Quran.
