AskMen,ffa5mfs,t1_ff9ssmx,1579728347.0,My boyfriend of 3 ish years has recently seemed distant too. If we aren’t talking about his work we aren’t talking at all. I am doing my best to be supportive and just let him grind. I don’t know my place in his life but I’d rather find out eventually than end it just bc there’s been some distance. I think it’s normal to experience some distance.

offmychest,ff1par7,t1_ff1okrx,1579483158.0,"I believe my anxiety is caused from my constant overthinking. I cannot get out of my head. I’m constantly assuming the worst and playing out terrible situations in my head until I’m extremely anxious. 

It’s very crippling and confusing at the same time because I can go a few days without any bad days and then bam I will have a really bad day where I can’t even get out of bed. There’s definitely some depression I am dealing with but sometimes I think the pressure of anxiety is far worse."
AskWomen,fema3tk,t3_epjce4,1579245503.0,"It’s okay to have differences! What fun would it be to agree on everything...

For example, my man is Armenian and doesn’t believe in God. I’m white and have a strong relationship with God. We’ve had ups and downs but been together for close to three years now. 

We both agree to disagree in respectful ways. 

I love hearing his point of view, I love his family, the food is amazing and I’m so thankful to have such an accepting family. 

Differences are so good. You two can teach each other SO many things. Best of luck to you (:"
offmychest,fem8dsf,t1_fem76hv,1579243485.0,"I probably didn’t give enough back story...  

Jessica (my friend) got with my sisters husband behind my back during Christmas...

I found out from my sister she was messaging him on Facebook. 

Then when he was staying at our family’s house with his two boys (my nephews) because he lives out of state he decided to leave the house to stay with Jessica. 

At this point they only new each other for two weeks. 
He choose to leave our house. 

BUT he told Jessica’s family we kicked him out and Jessica went along with it. I tried to talk to Jessica about the situation before he actually left but she said it’s not up to me. 

They spent the rest of his surprise trip to see his boys (my nephews) at Jessica’s house. 

After 10 years of friendship she trashed my family to her family, our friends, texted my sister to sign divorce papers and sees no wrong in her actions. 

As a side note my mom hired her, took her on family vacations, treated her as her own child... 

It’s not that she’s with my sisters husband it’s the way she went about it..."
