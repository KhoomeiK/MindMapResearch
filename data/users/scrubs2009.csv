40kLore,ffegzqn,t1_ffeciys,1579847638.0,"I disagree. I think all the primarchs read as being barely able to control their emotions. Even the calmest acting ones like Corax and the Khan feel like they have a very thin wall separating then from a mental breakdown at all times. I think they're designed to be humans but magnified, even our bad traits. [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/e8rx5d/why_does_it_feel_like_every_primarch_is/) is an excellent discussion on it which I think sums up my views nicely.

Plus, bear in mind that even before the Heresy they had all been around for about 1,000 years. Imagine the change in perspective living that long would give you combined with a brain faster than a supercomputer. They wouldn't think anything like a regular human."

It talks extensively about the impacts of fossil fuels but what they don't realize is that the vast vast **VAST** amount of fossil fuels have come from the Carboniferous. This was because there was a large amount of trees but no microbe had yet evolved that was capable of decomposing them before they could be buried and turned into coal and oil. 

So either the mysterious precursor civilization came before the carboniferous which would mean little to no available fossil fuels at all or after which would mean we wouldn't see nearly as much available as we do today."

Then you have RPG maker stuff. Really simple rpg games but pretty good. The Last Sovereign is currently about 80 hours long and has some of the best writing I've ever seen. Seriously, forget the smut. I want to see where the story goes. Ouroboros is much shorter but also insanely good. Written by the same girl who wrote TLS. 

Then you have the more complex RPGs. Most of the best ones are Japanese titles but not many get full translations. As for the ones that do, Bunny Black 1 and 2 are good. So is Kami No Rhapsody, Kamidori Alchemy Meister, and Evenicle. 

Finally there's some other pretty good titles like Baldy Sky which is like [DMC but with mechs](https://i.imgur.com/d0cjuWp.mp4) and Koikatsu Party which is basically a waifu creator.

Some of these titles are funky and require you to set your PC's system locale to Japan and stuff to be able to play them without crashes. If you have any other questions feel free to ask."

Michigan has lakes, lakes everywhere. Drive down one of the roads leading through dense forest areas and you'll see dozens and dozens of lakes of all shapes and sizes. It's an amazing place for fishing or hiking. 

One thing about California that people don't seem to mention so much is how hilly it is. For example, I live in Illinois and am used to being able to see maybe a mile away at most until something blocks my view. In California it doesn't matter if something blocks your view because there are hills and mountains behind it that you can still see so you end up seeing for miles and miles at a time.
