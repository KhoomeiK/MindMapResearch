Dogtraining,ffi61yy,t3_ets1ec,1579966045.0,"Background: Born maybe around April. Found and taken in ~4 months later by the rescue July with a bigger dog. Found roaming rural country side in an area known for dumping dogs. Weighed 11 lbs and found with heartworms, anemia, and mange. Our rescue was adopted in November and was neutered in December. 45 lbs now. 

Suspected lab, heeler, maybe border collie mix?

Rescue did a phenomenal job. He’s sweet, takes to lessons, wants to please so bad. But I fear/imagine ingrained to him is always scavenging for food. Despite regular feeding schedule, treats, chew toys, and work-to-eat toys like Kongs and Lickimats he’s always wanting to eat. (He doesn’t whine for it or counter surf. He did once swipe some salami from the coffee table... Sneakster!) We don’t give in because we don’t want him to get overweight. He’ll search around the home, lick random things. We’ve trained him to not eat from brother’s bowl. 

But even when taking him to potty through my complex, to the artificial grass area, and back he’s always looking and tries to get a bite or lick in of whatever he finds edible. I’ve got eyes and either get him to stop or take it, so the dropping/leaving isn’t really an issue. We sit and stay when we get to transition points in the complex. It’s more so just addressing that innate desire to always have nose on the ground in search for food. Maybe it’s genetic and I should just let time teach him we’ll always care for him? I just don’t want him to get into something and get sick. 

Hyper vigilance: I have reeled back some of the outdoor walks when I realized he wasn’t taking to loose leash training outside like he was in the complex because all of the lights, sounds, and people overstimulated him. He forgets *completely* about the treats! And has zero focus/listening on me despite clearly being good motivated. I think it reminds him of being outside so he’s in hyper-vigilance mode. I’m thinking of de-sensitizing him to noises indoors with treats and praise? SUPER high value treats outdoors? Thoughts?

Thank you!"

relationship_advice,ffi35uv,t1_ffhuvt8,1579963726.0,"On a similar and probably unpopular thought... Kids are smart. So smart. Yes. They are cute right now but by the age of 3, can pretty much respond to you and highlight anything and everything they see and hear. 

If you don’t change it, he will pick up on his grandmother’s different behavior around him at some point in his life. And at some point someone might share this story with your child either directly or indirectly. “It’s just, you remind her of someone who was bad.” “Grandma is just going through something, don’t worry about it.” You’ll constantly need to live with and consciously manage whether or not he or the family knows. And when he does find out and he does ask you or her, what then? Do you hate her for creating the association that your child now bears and everyone walks on eggshells over? Idk. 

It just seems like a greater weight and burden for your family than the inconvenience of changing the name."
rescuedogs,ffi22tb,t3_etrfne,1579962790.0,"We don’t know the breed clearly. Thinking heeler, lab, maybe border collie? Would love to hear your thoughts!"
rescuedogs,ffi1ntu,t3_es2x96,1579962414.0,Is he crate trained at all? I didn’t read mention of a crate so he’s allowed free reign at home? Or do you have a fenced in area in the home?
rescuedogs,ffi1eti,t3_esozfb,1579962186.0,Oh my god he looks incredible! Thank you for rescuing him. His ig handle is very fitting.
rescuedogs,ffi19pd,t3_ethbra,1579962054.0,Cross posting in r/reactivedogs might help. I’m so sorry to hear about the challenges you are facing with your dog.

Veterinary,ffdyrl8,t3_eh9xdv,1579832281.0,How did the pup come in? Was he carrying him? I can’t imagine the pup lying down or walking without him tripping over his organs spilling out. This is so heartbreaking.
Veterinary,ffdypho,t1_fcheac7,1579832239.0,u/tarzan22241 The link was broken for me. Just wanted you to know. I really hope he’s doing okay. Thank you and your team so much for all of the work you did. Seriously. Hugs from me and our dogs.

Dallas,fefo796,t3_eorv2p,1579060669.0,"When I see the older grandfather collecting cans at 6 am or late into the evening, that’s who I donate to. Panhandlers pain me too but those who are out there trying to make something deserve it far more. In my eyes. 

Panhandlers who use kids is what infuriates me. 

I once had two boys approach me at the entrance of a Walgreens/CVS and ask me money for school supplies. I was startled and declined (no cash). When I came back out, I saw that they were across the street reporting to a man in a car. I promptly took the license plate # and called 911."

In retrospect, as oppose to starting on a Monday I probably would have done Friday. But just always read your body and have snacks and food on hand."
calmhands,fe4vws8,t3_ensprr,1578863284.0,"I treat myself to the nail salon and get dip on them. When the flimsy nail length I have breaks because maybe I popped the nail off (from picking at them — not 100% cured), the girl just adds a fake nail. Looks just like the rest and honestly, has helped me from biting them since May. And I was basically 30 with a lifelong nail bitting addiction. I’m surprised it’s helped so much. But I honestly just don’t think I can have healthy strong nail beds *AND* stop my nail biting."
