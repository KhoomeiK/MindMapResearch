I think your question is more neurology based (or neuropsychology) rather than from a therapists perspective.  While therapists do learn and consider memory in practice - short term/long term, traumatic... the neurological side does study memory much more in depth, looking at why some memories are retained and others aren’t.  For years they’ve been looking into how we look at memories and if it is possible to forget - especially in the case of trauma.  You’re much more likely to get a better understanding of the research there.

Often good therapists will take questionnaires from clients to see how well their client is progressing and if they’re client is happy. Sometimes clients have feedback forms at the end of sessions too.

therapy,fe6aiq0,t1_fe6a5ea,1578885493.0,"no, not at all! Some GPs are really good with mental health but unfortunately they are hard to come across. 
Honestly it’s so easy to feel like a number but I promise that you’re not - once you get to finding a good therapist it’s totally worth it. I think you just have to advocate hard to the point where it’s like “I don’t want meds. I’m here for a referral only”"

therapy,fe6892r,t3_enxtzm,1578883954.0,"I’m in Australia too and very familiar with our flawed systems!! 
I can tell you though that a diagnosis won’t necessarily change your treatment or approach from your GP.  You can have one person go to a number of different GPs for the same issue - some will shoo them out the door with a script, others a referral.  It just depends on the doctor.
One thing you can do though is request a referral and say no to a script.  It’s your healthcare, and your time.
Good luck and I hope the next therapist is a good one!"
askatherapist,fe67kst,t3_enwcvm,1578883567.0,"The way I see it -
It’s completely up to you (the client) to try and get to know whoever you like, whether that be the therapist, their best friend, colleagues or whatever.
It’s up to the therapist to establish boundaries to protect the relationship.
I personally don’t see a problem with you becoming friends with the receptionist, but I kind of see a problem with the therapist introducing people to you."
australia,fe66iy4,t3_enu8qn,1578882898.0,"It’s also important to report them when you see them.  I managed to get one taken down pretending to be the Red Cross.  The more people that report it the better chance it has.

Also pro tip: a lot of go fund me ones who are raising money for charities have a verified tick near them.

Edit: the IG account is raising funds for the Australian koala foundation which is legit"
mentalhealth,fdzva1w,t1_fdzjaxo,1578796627.0,"I do think a therapist is a best bet - sometimes there’s ones that work with organisations/schools etc.  It might even be worth seeing your doctor too.
One thing that might help though is setting up a schedule.  Even if you have an alarm that goes off to say it’s time to eat, and then have a list of things to choose from.  Having pre-prepared meals and snacks can help, so even if you’re not feeling hungry just having a little bit of food to keep you going.  
While this suggestion may not get you motivated, it might take away some of that emotional toll and give you some more energy."
