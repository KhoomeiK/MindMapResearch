Botchedsurgeries,ffewkhn,t1_ffew4u4,1579868490.0,"Absolutely no clue. Not only are models expected to be naturally beautiful at all angles, they are also people with talent. They have to be able to express emotions and moods with just a pic (and whatever makeup and hair). When you have fillers, you sorta only have one setting on your face. And when you have excessive filters, the eyes get much smaller. And ... eyes are kinda the way to go when it comes to emotion? I dont know, I approve of filters but I definitely think they should be much more light handed in general."

fatlogic,ffevs55,t1_ffetcrv,1579867628.0,"Yeah, kinda here to write that comment. Attractiveness is subjective. There absolutely are fit muscular guys that want chubby women. There is nothing wrong with that, the same way there is nothing wrong with liking muscular guys. 


However, there is a bit of a ... hypocrisity? I guess? Here. She doesn't want to ""settle for overweight"" but at the same time she thinks she is a ""plus sized"" gem. Just the usage of the different descriptions is enough to know. 


On the other hand, whisper is one of the most toxic, horrible places where trash people congregate. It's where the entitled women, horrible incels and disgusting creeps come together. It should not be taken for a sample of real life."
Botchedsurgeries,ffeujli,t3_et67n4,1579866154.0,"I watched a tutorial of hers reviewed by Robert Welsh recently. And honestly, you dont need the professional MUA reveal to see she sucks at make-up and skincare. Just so many wrongs. The way I see it - if half the effort that went into fillers went into self care and skin care, she wouldnt end up on this subreddit."
AskMen,fepxwj8,t1_feo4fe3,1579334410.0,"Okay, I will re-phrase my thoughts because I probably didnt express them well enough.


Strong =/= unfeeling. Women want you to have feelings and express them because that shows women that youre in love with them. They just dont want you to cry at the drop of a hat. Thats the majority. 


The majority of men is taught at a very young age that ""crying is bad"", ""boys dont cry"" and at exclusivelly male circles, ""sharing is bad"". The give and take emotional friendship is often unavailable to men. As such, men often hide feelings, dont share, etc. I have had lengthy discussions on the topic and while this is a trend that is changing - men often see a romantic partner as the only one you can share with. That creates a disharmony in sharing emotions in general. But more importantly, it often creates negative feelings and those are very easy to reinforce. 


When you have been taught that sharing is bad, women hate sensitive guys, even one woman reinforcing that notion is enough. No matter how toxic the woman might be or what the circumstances were. And we are talking about circumstances a lot here. Not everyone at every point of their life is ready to accept your emotional baggage, regardless of whether they could accept someone elses. 


So I think toxic women exist, yes. But that is not the majority of them. What you're doing is throwing whataboutit-ism into the scene here. It isnt the same as being tall because in this case, having emotions is being tall. Women love it. They just arent prepared to take it from just anyone or at just any time of their lives. Some women are never prepared and those women are toxic. 


You kinda see it in the thread here: ""I had issues and I finally broke down"". When you get to that point, a lot of people are going to leave. At the time, it hurts like a fucking bitch, it is incredibly insulting and you have every right to hate that person with a burning hatred. But that simply means that person wasnt prepared to take your feelings and that youre incompatible, not that feelings are bad. You take those feelings to a cherished friend instead and heal. 


Being strong is fully and entirely compatible with having feelings. Being strong is often about having emotional stability as well. So if you have created this image of an unfeeling robot and then you break apart like a glass that the cat pushed off an exceptionally tall counter, you're going to have issues. Because you created an image and then shattered it. And often people want to date the image. When the image ""unfeeling stronK man""  and the real ""human being with fears and wants"" clash, partners are going to leave. The same way they are for ""emotionally stable soft spoken woman"" versus ""human that cries and wants"". 


The notion is safety is very important here. Because you created a safe bubble with an image. And then the image is taken away. Of course youre going to feel unsafe and leave. It is not lying. You didnt do it on purpose. You did what anyones in the dating game does - sells their best version. But they liked the best version. It is not the feelings fault. Its not that you werent strong. It just didnt work out."
AskMen,femxgw5,t1_femmdah,1579272146.0,"Every time you generalize, it's not going to work. Men do give a shit. Because while 70 years ago women were expected to be weak, they are expected to be an equal partner today. I got dumped once because I cried last year. 


Are there women who expect men to be stronger? Yes. But you cannot generalize the whole ""women want men to not show emotion"". We dont. We want men to be emotional because thats proof we are cared for. 


What we largelly dont want is an overemotional man. The same way men dont want an overly emotional woman. Because that would mean putting yourself in a situation wherr you have to be a caretaker, not a parter. The same way you were for your ex and the same way I have been for an ex. It is tiring."
lonely,fejp11b,t3_epghwg,1579182104.0,"Finding a partner and being lonely are not the same thing, my friend. Being in an emotionally unfulfiling relationship or with someone who like you just because you have a vagina will not make you less lonely.

Or for having a different structure. But accepting fat as the new norm aint it, chief. When youre fat or chubby (like I am, lets be real), you have to admit it to yourself first. 


Medical concerns with obesity are a thing. They have nothing to do with fat shaming even without my first point."
AskMen,fejl062,t3_epfb2w,1579178448.0,"Woman here - it has happened to me too. I think it simply isnt a gender thing.


People see you and talk to you for a bit and then they start creating this ideal version of a partner inside their head. And once you open up, you shatter the illusion. You suddenly have baggage attached and people are afraid of that.


I have definitely also been guilty of doing it. In the end  what matters is - if they couldnt handle that you have emotions, they werent the right person for you."

relationships,fegwu50,t1_fegqkd2,1579104308.0,"I think that isnt the issue here. People may want sex more than 3-4 times a week, many women too. But there are ebbs and flow in everyones life. Sex desire too. And life does not always allow for daily sex. What if you have kids and one of you is tired and doesnt want to? What if you have explosive diarhhea or your foot is broken? What if you were stessed at work and need tea and book to work through it? Things just happen.


You have to accept that sometimes compromise is needed. And I think the issue here is that the BF is not accepting that compromise. He is just blaming and not communicating."

badwomensanatomy,fdyr4p7,t3_enbc2y,1578782750.0,"This... while I am sure it is possible it has happened someplace, is not a thing doctors just do. 


Suturing the vaginal canal is difficult. They are really soft tissues, in an awkward place, in a relativelly changed at the time of the suturing anatomy - some mistakes might happen. Even more - even if sutured perfectly, never  with any suture do you have the absolute guarantee of things healing properly. Keloids form, fibrosis forms, adhesions form. Also - sewing a healthy tissue to another healthy tissue would not form new tissue. I.e. you cant just fold in the corners of a tear and it would somehow produce a new line of healing.


This is honestly propaganda. No doctor in a country that has lawyers would risk their entire career for some notion that a tighter vagina is better. Especially not for the dad. ObGyns are there for a mother and a baby. In fact, a whole lot of them dont even like talking to dads. And defs not with enough grasp on the female anatomy. Which is sth that OnGyns specialise in.

But to be comoletely honest - if this is your first time, splurge on a pedicure and watch and ask questions. Nail techs can fish out an ingrown nail, they can cut, they can teach you some stuff and your feet will be perky af. Also, if the issue is not the nail, the tech will likely be able to tell if you go to a good one.
