reiki,ffg0w54,t3_etfmp7,1579896049.0,Reiki healing doesn’t involve using your own energy to give to others. It taps into the infinite pool. There are many other energy healing techniques than Reiki. You are definitely a healer! (: Be careful not to wear yourself out.

massage,ffefbah,t3_esvwkt,1579845835.0,You can call and say you want to get their Groupon pricing directly through them. Then they won’t lose the large cut to Groupon but you still get the discount they offered.

massage,fepc5xz,t3_eq5jm9,1579316929.0,"Do they advertise that they practice trigger point therapy? If that’s the usual massage session they offer, then it would make sense that it’s what you would get. At any time during your session if you don’t like the way things are going, you need to say so. Otherwise how will we know? I get a lot of clients who love trigger point work and enjoy the whole session being that, and as long as they tell me before that that’s what works for them, then I can plan accordingly. 

It would be good to mention the areas you would like work on before the massage, what types of massage you enjoy, and to adjust session length accordingly. It sounds like they were rushed for time towards the end. Unfortunately sometimes you just don’t work well with the therapist’s skill sets. But getting a massage you did not enjoy is a good reference point for telling your next therapist what you don’t what."
