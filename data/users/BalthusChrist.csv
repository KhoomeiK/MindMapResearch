As in, not committing suicide, but walking up and blowing the head off of my alternate self.

I imagine traveling around and doing it over and over, wearing different costumes and using different weapons. Like, I'll dress up the way I looked at the time, shoot the other me, and then tell everyone who witnesses it, ""no one will ever believe you."" Or I'll dress up like Wolf from Future Man, and stab the other me in the heart with a bowie knife while screaming about him being a biotic. Maybe rip his jugular out with my teeth too.

It's kinda stress relieving."
