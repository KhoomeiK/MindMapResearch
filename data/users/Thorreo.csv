Dogtraining,fgt0u9g,t3_f0872x,1581096692.0,"One of the biggest benefits of working with professionals early on is that they have experience working with many dogs and understand dog's body language. They can teach you as an owner what that body language means and how to train your specific dog, and it can be incredibly helpful. You can absolutely do it without working with a professional, it is possible, but working with a professional will generally enrich and help create the best relationship between you and your pup. Whatever you decide to do, this subreddit and r/puppy101 have a lot of wonderful resources to help with a plethora of needs. You sound like you'll be a great parent for your pup."
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fgq2lxo,t1_fgi4v1e,1581016689.0,"This sounds like mine. We have 4 right now which is over his ""limit"" but we wouldn't have 4 if he hadn't decided to keep the stray cat who got dumped from a car outside my workplace."
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fgq2d8h,t3_ez3lvc,1581016562.0,"We have a heavy cat like this, he only got cuter because he started out with a moon face"
dadswhodidnotwantpets,fgq24pd,t3_ezm554,1581016434.0,That pup looks a lot like mine! So cute.
fireemblem,fghzxuk,t1_fgfh9qd,1580799473.0,My husband and I had a similar thought when we first heard it
dogs,fgh2uqm,t3_ey64pg,1580775377.0,"One of my kitties was given up at 9 when they got a kitten and he started ""attacking it"" (don't believe that for a second) and marking around the house (suspect). He has been one of the sweetest, most lovable cats I've ever owned, and is currently 16. I couldn't imagine ever giving up a pet who was ""too old""."
dogs,fgh2q64,t1_fgg2tkv,1580775289.0,I feel this so very hard right now. We just lost my childhood lab after 11 years last year and I wish I could have just one more day with him healthy and happy.
puppy101,fgfv59d,t1_fgfv33f,1580748295.0,"It's definitely a long process, but you seem like you've got a good handle on it. If only we could train our husbands like that haha"
puppy101,fgfula8,t3_ey8ap5,1580747946.0,"When we were potty training, we took him out on a timed schedule, and one of us would take him out every 1 or 2 hours. It really helped prevent accidents since he knew he would be going out soon, and accelerated the potty training schedule. But now that he is potty trained my husband will ignore when he needs to go out unless I get up to take him then he gets right to taking him out. It's so frustrating"
shitpostemblem,fgf2lmi,t1_fgdu81x,1580720988.0,"It's not that they can't afford it, but that GameFreak is a Japanese company who insists on remaining as a small team and not recruiting many foreigners. So they could have a huge staff and make an amazing game but they don't"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fgev5qo,t1_fgdratj,1580711201.0,Ours will watch with us and get very confused at dog sounds as he wanders around looking at the tv and whining
BipolarSOs,fgee0d9,t3_exwvwn,1580697386.0,"I'm gonna agree with the other commentators about the success of not engaging when my husband is like this. My husband has a lot of anger, and frequently will lash out (although he is rarely lashing out at me). I have flashbacks when he starts to get angry, and he's broken several of our items during his rages, but I find if I just let him get through the feelings and calm down on his own while quietly sitting with him. He will usually calm down significantly faster that way."
reactivedogs,fge476m,t1_fgd01tc,1580690987.0,I'm hoping as he transitions out of puppy age and into his mature self he will settle down and learn to be alright with other dogs. We had a pretty rough day today [ran into 3 dogs on one walk] and seeing your success gives me a lot more hope for our munchkin.
reactivedogs,fgciaan,t3_exobp3,1580672893.0,"I hear you on all of this. I grew up with a reactive dog, and got a puppy desperately hoping for him to be normal after my childhood dog had passed. My puppy is extremely reactive and anxious, and the constant need to be on top of everything and on guard is so draining for me. Sending you lots of love"
fireemblem,fg78y9g,t1_fg6lxp3,1580586783.0,I didnt know she could be recruited in CF
fireemblem,fg5d2ly,t1_fg57nxy,1580524281.0,"Blue lions is the most ""complete"" story from what I understand. I really enjoyed it. I haven't finished BE yet so I don't have a great answer there, but I'm sure whichever one you choose will be fun"
AmItheAsshole,ffywmek,t1_ffxuivi,1580356987.0,"They also post videos where the child in question is asking/screaming for them to stop and that he hates the pranks, and videos where he was crying during them"
fireemblem,ffyjkkk,t3_euej3e,1580347959.0,"Started BE. Was originally gonna do SS but I think I'll do CF instead since I've only completed BL. Making progress slowly but surely.

Edit: Does anyone have tips/helpful info for CF?"

SmashBrosUltimate,ffxm09g,t1_ffxlxzi,1580327853.0,I got his ending with Felix which was also hella gay so I was happy lol
smashbros,ffxeqcc,t1_ffuaclo,1580323649.0,"He kept just having nothing interactions with the reinforcements that came in for me. Oh, you take no damage from them? Great, except you always fucking miss your attacks you lumbering armored buffoon"
smashbros,ffxelmv,t1_fftvlbi,1580323572.0,"My other favorite is when they insist on attacking, dont get hit by the counter, but miss their attack and just sit there uselessly for the whole map"
SmashBrosUltimate,ffxehd3,t1_ffxedw9,1580323502.0,"I chose bylad for my BL playthrough because I thought the lords would be bi and I wanted to romance Dimitri so bad. But then my friend told me they weren't, and I almost restarted my playthrough."
smashbros,ffxd8n1,t1_ffwfzrc,1580322766.0,"I just started BE after finishing BL and I agree. My husband made a comment that Hubert seems to have a crush on Edelgard, and I told him that he is more like dedue: his whole purpose and goals in life are to support Edelgard, and he is fiercely loyal and protective of her."
