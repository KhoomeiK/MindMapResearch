japanlife,ffzzck9,t3_ew5mw7,1580396693.0,You don't need it.  When I tried to register for one (because I thought needed it) the folks at my ward office talked me out of it.  They told me the only thing it would be useful for would be to use the vending machines at the ward office/convenience stores to print out certain stuff without having to wait in line.  They also said they're phasing out MyNumber in a year or so.
japanlife,ffzdkfq,t1_ffzczqd,1580373683.0,"I've been to 3 weddings in Japan and every time there was always an envelope in the bag of gifts under our chair at the reception addressed to to us that contained cash.  In all cases it this was never discussed before hand so we didn't know we would get it.  Did the previous weddings you've been to at least give you/everyone reasonable valuable gifts (e.g. fancy wine, a gift catalogue, some porcelain stuff, etc)?"
japan,ffz426l,t1_ffwm5j8,1580363266.0,"Spending many hours of my youth playing Driver 2 certainly put Chicago on the itinerary for me the first time I visites the US.  Got my friend to drive me along those streets under the elevated railways, down Lake Shore Dr and past Wrigley Stadium just so I could feel like I was in the game.  I come from a country that is never represented popular global media/games so visiting the US was a real novelty for me to see places that previously didn't seem real as I'd only known them as the settings for fictional stories.  Can't blame someone for thinking and doing the same for Japan."
japanlife,ffys72t,t1_ffym2bu,1580353833.0,"He said they just showed up one day, which I take to mean they hadn't visited before.  He's got a kid in school, so my bet is the info about his country of origin leaked through that network."
japanlife,ffyk140,t1_ffyjfi4,1580348274.0,I've come to enjoy Shinjuku at rush hour.  For me it's like relaxing in the surf and letting the waves just beat down on me.  I just move through it slowly while listing to some chill beats and find it all quite refreshing.
japanlife,ffyjokx,t1_ffygczx,1580348035.0,"Same thing happened to my friend, except he does for sure speak Spanish as his mother tongue but lives way out in the inaka.  One day these fluent Spanish speaking JWs rocked up out the blue which must have been creepy as hell."
japanlife,ffyj4bu,t1_ffyhkto,1580347649.0,"You just gotta lean into it, literally and mentally.  I like to think everyone is using the opportunity for a little fun bit of sports at the end their day."
japan,ffyilcd,t1_ffy1vdl,1580347288.0,In my experience the few extra hours a day at work isn't even really work either.  Occasionally I put in overtime till like 8pm but only to meet a deadline and not in order to appease anyone or look good (I work in a public research institute). It's kinda nice not having the stress of being constantly pitted off against my coworkers in competition for a promotion but the flip side of that is I rarely get praise for doing anything faster/smarter so there is no incentive to innovate... which seems kind of ironic for semi scientific/academic place to me.  On a structural/societal level this attitude is indeed part of what holds Japan's economy back from changing/growing and whether or not that is a good or bad thing is a whole other conversation.
japan,ffw2pcp,t3_evf6lj,1580281756.0,"Unpopular opinion, and maybe entirely wrong as I have no first hand experience, but the US seems ways worse... no?  Hardly any public holidays, paid leave seems to be non-existent for my friends there, seems really easy to get fired/hardly any employee protections or rights.  At least in Japan we have stability in our work contracts."
japanlife,ffvyg85,t1_ffvi70e,1580277218.0,"Hopefully we don't see any contagious viruses take hold anywhere nearby, hmmm. It might be the first sign of the next major self-correction... The black plague saw 60% of Europes population perish, which took a further 200 years to recover.  That period gave us cool stuff like gothic architecture, the break down of the feudal system, etc.  In the long run, something like that happening again could that'll be good for the planet, our culture, wealth inequality, etc...  Maybe 100s of years from now our modern sustainable architecture will become historical tourist attractions of some curiosity to people living in a de-populated world of less than 3bn."
japanlife,ffvxn1v,t3_evg2td,1580276441.0,Had mixed emotions while enjoying a lovely T-shirt weather picnic in the park today.
korea,ffvxgi5,t1_ffv7fco,1580276272.0,I saw a large family on the subway over here in Japan and could see luggage tags dated yesterday clearly indicating they'd just landed at Narita from a Chinese airport.  They all had P95s... but they definitely weren't wearing them properly and were constantly taking them off to scold their kids... wait for it... for taking theirs off.  Needless to say I noticed a lot of side eye happening.
Tokyo,ffpkicz,t1_ffpi1dv,1580097256.0,"I preemptively ate all the extra bread and milk I bought for breakfast because the forecast said it might rain ice at 4pm.  I'm lactose intolerant and have coeliac but thought it wouldn't matter, but it did, and now I've clogged my toilet with all the extra toilet paper I bought, too.  What should I do?  I think I'll just leave a passive aggressive note on my neighbours door blaming them..."
japanlife,fff6yw1,t1_ffew4lh,1579877289.0,"Holy shit this post makes me feel old because I have nfi what any of this shit means.  So... can I still use my GeForce2 MX200 and play RA2 over IPX round here?  Also, have we got an IRC channel up and running for this sub or what?"
japanlife,ffbz435,t3_esqn79,1579787301.0,"I opened an account with Shinsei at a branch in a ward I don't live in (the one near Tokyo station) without having a work contract the day after I got my zairyu card, i.e. within 2 weeks of moving to Japan.  Whole process took about 20mins.  Everything was in English.  Got to pet a robot dog walking around the branch while I waited."
