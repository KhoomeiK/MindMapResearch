Can you name 1 piece of news that

1. You believe
2. Is critical of the president
3. Was not presented with direct evidence (like a video or a recording of some sort)

If you can't, I assume that means that your view of the world is almost entirely shaped by what Donald Trump agrees with. Do you think there might be a problem with that?"

What exactly are the impacts of the barrel length? Like, imagine I had a 5 meter long barrel (and the appropriately sized cartridge and the right powder), how would that influence the accuracy and speed of my bullet?

I'm asking because as a kid I used to think that longer barrels meant greater accuracy but slower bullets (because more friction) but then I learned that any extra time inside the barrel meant more time being pushed by the expanding gas and therefore more power, so why not make extremely long barrels for very specific jobs that require a ton of power & accuracy?"

If the US population decided to elect a president who promises to completely open the borders, that means ""*we decided*"" (to put it in your words) to get rid of the whole legal immigration system. Would you be ok with that? 

To give you a less extreme example: if we decided to forego one aspect of immigrants scrutiny (say, their country of origin), we would effectively abandon some of our freedom to choose who gets in, and yet, that would itself be our choice. 
So would you be ok with that?"
