Now, this probably isn't recommended because an index fund is likely to give you a higher return over the long run (decades if you buy and never sell) but it is also subject to market forces and bear markets.

Don't have the cash, don't like the idea of owning a non detached apartment that you can't rent and get the money out of, have experience or know of someone who has had bad experiences with real estate and family, etc.

I'm actually in a similar situation where in-laws don't have cash but have a large house they insist on dying in.

You're already on the right track with asking for advice on the pros and cons of repair vs replace. One last thing that doesn't seem to have come up yet is that you are only making $15/hour and work part time. People who make $15/hour and work part time shouldn't be getting new cars. Maybe you don't mean brand new, but throwing a large % of your total savings at a ""newer"" car doesn't get you a whole lot for the money.

Also, the average age of a vehicle on the road today is 11.8 years... So exactly as old as your car. No need to get rid of it due to regular maintenance costs. Cars have become very reliable and long lasting. 

My mother tells me of neighbors buying a new vehicle every 2 years or so and said this wasn't uncommon. Vehicles weren't thought to last super long, and heck, they used to make odometers only go to 99,999! You should be able to get another 50,000 to 100,000 miles on the vehicle if you're willing to do basic repairs.

People talk about adding a vapor barrier but I honestly think it's a bit overblown. I don't believe other RV's do vapor barriers and it's incredibly challenging to actually install. Not sure it would have been worth the time and headache. At the end of the day, just make sure to ventilate regularly and you should be good!"
vandwellers,fe68zmu,t3_enwuy2,1578884419.0,Nice. I did the same and it's worked out really well. Comfortably survived 0 degree nights (F) with an Espar heater.
MapPorn,fdp58o4,t1_fdp3om1,1578620293.0,"The point is that maps need legends. Or in this case, at least a timeframe otherwise it's missing something so critical that what's being presented isn't actually useful.

For example ""Single payer healthcare in America will cost $39 trillion dollars"".

That statement is useless without a timeframe. $39 trillion every minute? Every hour? Every month? Every year? Every decade? Over the next 50 years?"

Is this from pre-history until the alien conquest of 3491 or is it the last 1 month?"

[My tires are E-rated, 10 ply, 80psi max with a load index of 123 (3.415 lb/tire max).](https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=BFGoodrich&tireModel=All-Terrain+T%2FA+KO2&partnum=675R6KO2RWL) You must be looking at Passenger tires.

[E rating means they are 10 ply (although what they really mean is they are 10 ply equivilant to earlier ply's. Today's tires may only have 2-3 fabric plys and 1 steel ply and are still called 10 ply) This does NOT have to do with the number of ply's on the sidewall.](https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=55)

Speaking of sidewall ply's, LT, KO2's do have 3 polyester plys on the sidewalls for added strength. 

Given that I can't get much of a better tire for the van than what I already have, I can't worry too much about sidewall stress seeing as I'm not at the tires max weight."
