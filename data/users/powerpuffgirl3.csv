recruitinghell,ffjzg6l,t1_fagqu78,1580011208.0,"Yeah.  If you don't leave a voicemail, then I won't return your call.  Do you know how many damn robot calls I've had just today?  I'fe had five robo calls and it is Saturday.  And they automatically go to voicemail.  I'm not sitting by the phone.  I have shit to do.  Or better yet, you have my resume, send an email."
recruitinghell,ffjvw5o,t3_e9zb2k,1580008390.0,Why is this person a recruiter?  Just why?
recruitinghell,ffju4ec,t3_e9qv2i,1580006997.0,No.  I would ignore them right back.  And I have.
recruitinghell,ffjs6ay,t1_fav1zv5,1580005494.0,"I would love to be a recruiter to help people get jobs; especially if they have been looking for a longtime, but I run into these a-hole people on the phone.  Dude I can do your job so much better and with passion and compassion.  It is ridiculous."
recruitinghell,ffjp9op,t3_ecf4fe,1580003535.0,"I have gotten two of those via text message by the same staffing company and two different employees.  So let's see, there is clearly no communication there because I already ignored the first person.  You won't tell me what company it is for and how much and you won't even use my name.  You also want my email and phone numb er, both of which are on my resume and you already sent a text to my phone.  So you're just a bot and I don't have time for it.  Be professional and send an email.  And delete.

I don't have time for the BS.  I just delete it.  I don't know you personally, do not send me a text!"

antiwork,ffiqh35,t3_etuhzj,1579980171.0,Good for you OP.  I stood up for myself for the first time in my life to management years ago and it felt good.  I wish you well.
recruitinghell,ffinyqd,t1_fbii14s,1579978430.0,"I don't deal with this bullshit.  I've wasted my little bit of money on bus fare to come down and deal with someone that shouldn't be in that job.  I don't have time for games.  If people want to expect that, good for them, but I won't."
recruitinghell,ffijvy5,t1_fcgg5px,1579975619.0,I like you.

recruitinghell,ffhhv5l,t3_emgb3d,1579935936.0,"Speaking from experience, no.  I can see when my resume has been viewed.  Okay, so it's been a few days and I want to know why you haven't called me yet.  I know you saw my resume and you're ""urgently hiring.""  They are not ""urgently hiring."".  They're probably just hoarding the resumes that come in.   Creeps."

recruitinghell,ffhf1f2,t3_enjbpz,1579932532.0,"Okay.  So I just went on LinkedIn to see what all the hype is about and boy oh boy.  The interface sucks.  I had no idea how or where to post a resume.  I said screw it after about five minutes.  If you use the site and it works, then I'm happy for you.  I will stick to Indeed."

Oh I hate it when people tell someone that; especially on Reddit.  
Just shut up! Ya know.  That doesn't help and the person is already stressed and stretched thin."
recruitinghell,ffhcxgq,t1_fedbke1,1579930289.0,"I've seen it.  It is scary.  If you take this treatment from a job, what about a romantic relationship.  I can't save you from maybe getting hurt and possibly killed.  I just want people to realize you don't have to take abuse from a job, a spouse, a parent, etc."

recruitinghell,ffhcidm,t3_eo5u89,1579929868.0,"I only had one bad one and I stayed because it allowed me to get a view into the job.  I had already heard bad things, but I had the chance to see it for myself and I was not disappointed."
recruitinghell,ffhc99y,t1_feawcmc,1579929615.0,LOL!
recruitinghell,ffh9tkk,t1_femtenq,1579927305.0,Probably not.  I sent in resumes for several jobs through Robert Half and I have not received one reply.  Ranstad called me.  I've had very good luck with them in the past.

recruitinghell,ffh3ybq,t3_eqq30x,1579922459.0,They want free work to use and not put your name on or pay you for.  Should be illegal.
