asktransgender,fen1gkv,t1_fen1byw,1579274845.0,I really appreciate your help and your kind words. Thank you so much!
asktransgender,femxyqn,t1_femxoi9,1579272495.0,"Thank you for the reply. It’s been so long since I’ve worn a bra, so I have no idea what size I am right now, but I fear I’m larger than an A cup. I want top surgery, but am afraid seeing those giant scars are going to make me hate my chest just the same as I do now. I’m just in a really rough place mentally with my whole transition right now. I’ve been doubting and generally just kinda losing my mind."
asktransgender,femwgks,t1_feavl7w,1579271407.0,"Can I ask what size you were before your surgery? I keep praying that I’ll have a small enough chest to get peri, but I’m really nervous that I’m just a little too large."
asktransgender,femv75c,t3_eq0kwk,1579270479.0,"I don’t really have a great answer for the first question, but in terms of the latter, I’d have to say Sam Collins. 
He used to be one of my absolute favorite YouTubers. He made me happy to be apart of this community and helped me with a lot of the questions I was having as I was discovering who I was, but lately he’s just so bitter and whiny and I honestly can’t believe I ever liked him now. It makes me sad."
iPhone11Pro,feef2xv,t1_feef2ae,1579032446.0,Thank you!
iPhone11Pro,feef077,t1_feees4s,1579032399.0,I honestly have no idea how it worked out so well. I know I had it set on natural lighting in portrait mode and I laid on the ground to get that angle. I’ll try messing around with it again and see if I can figure out what I did to get the blur effect. Sorry it’s not a better answer! I’m still learning about the camera too.
FTM_SELFIES,fee2cet,t1_fedzgkg,1579024943.0,"Little bit of dry shampoo after a shower to give it some texture, then pomade and the tiniest bit of mousse. Then I just blow dry it while I comb it back and stick it down with hairspray. Some days it goes quick, but most days I have to fight with it. Good luck!"

Apparently Heisenberg is there too."
OverwatchSwitch,fecwaey,t1_fecw026,1578987157.0,"Ah, I gotcha. I just now unlocked competitive play on the switch so I haven’t started gaining rankings yet. I really only play if Total Mayhem is available these days. I know, I’m one of those people.

I originally played on PS4 and got myself leveled up around the 200 range. I’m doing my best to get up there on the Switch. It’s a slow process."
OverwatchSwitch,fecvrrz,t1_fecvnow,1578986564.0,"I’m usually a bit better with keeping my healing/damage ratio closer than that. This was just a tough game with a good opposing team comp.

SR? Sorry, I should probably know what this is, but don’t."
bulletjournal,fectw3t,t3_eof5qi,1578984433.0,"Sorry you lost your boy. On the other hand, happy early birthday! Mine is the 26th, so we can be birthday pals!"
CFB,feco0jb,t1_fecnwru,1578978755.0,Yeah. Right after he picked his nose and ate it.
CFB,fecnim9,t1_fecngd1,1578978370.0,Couldn’t have said it better myself.
CFB,fecn15p,t1_fecmx5g,1578977989.0,"It’s hard to say. The refs are just garbage. I love my Clemson Tigers, but these refs have been super unfair to both sides tonight."
CFB,fecmw3z,t1_fecmqwk,1578977877.0,I’m lost too
CFB,fecmvo4,t1_fecmqwp,1578977868.0,I’m glad I’m not the only one who sees the resemblance
YouOnLifetime,fe0dqqc,t1_fdzzd2c,1578811110.0,"I thought Joe went to Henderson’s surgeon, which I found ironic considering what happened to old Hendy."
weed,fdp3yuj,t3_emc7vi,1578619443.0,"I wanted to give you gold, but I did the best I could right now. May your dad rest in piece. I know nothing can take away the pain you feel from losing him. I’m sorry for your loss."

goats,fdfx9tp,t1_fdfwuh5,1578372736.0,She will have other goats with her. Three other females. She’s going to be well taken care of. :)
