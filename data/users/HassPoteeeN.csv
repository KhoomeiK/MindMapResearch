depression,fd53nqr,t3_ek0o2u,1578173895.0,I don’t know if I could ever help you or understand what you’re going through. But remember there are people who are willing to attempt to give advice or at least be a listening ear. Hang in there friend. Things will definitely change.
depression,fd52kiv,t3_ejwj7e,1578173654.0,Very bitter taste after reading that one. It was quite nice though. Do you enjoy writing poems?
depression,fd51w2v,t1_fd4nvgm,1578173427.0,I’ve always had something similar. If anyone opened up about being down or maybe even depression around the social circles where I live people would mostly get alienated. Usually all opening up does when I’ve been around is to make a tense mood around the everyone who heard. Life’s hard sometimes.
depression,fd51abn,t3_ek0i2i,1578173217.0,"I have the same problem. Not a single one of my friends give a single fuck about my sadness that always creeps up on me. It’s always the same ”oh but I am also sad sometimes so you should totally keep doing those things that you’ve told us multiple times makes you inevitably uncomfortable! Come now pussy!” 

Of course I am paraphrasing but those are the essentials of it."
depression,fd50gzx,t3_ejxm7l,1578172940.0,You did really well! I bet you could do it any day with that great moxy! I believe in you.
depression,fd4yncr,t1_fd4u8dd,1578172448.0,Thanks. I do really appreciate it. Even though my way to express it feels very wack right now. My feelings are quite mixed about everything right now. I appreciate this anyhow :)

4PanelCringe,fcqtkoq,t3_eig7we,1577891993.0,"I agree with this one tho

I live on a farm and I can never go celebrate anywhere but at home since the animals go haywire if we don't stand around and calm them down."
