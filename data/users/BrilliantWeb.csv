AskReddit,ff9ksxk,t3_esc8vq,1579715102.0,"Kicking around the idea I have for a screenplay similar to this. My problem with a lot of time travel movies is they are unrelatable. Meaning, if someone from a thousand years in the future comes to our time we can't comprehend the difference. Or they bring someone like Abraham Lincoln to the present - the poor guy would probably have an aneurysm trying to comprehend what he's looking at. So I'm working on a script where the protagonist is in 1974. He works at an AMC dealership, so he's not exactly tech ignorant. I think it would be interesting to see him try to adapt not only to the world of 2020 in terms of technology, but also in political correctness and attitudes.

I remember a friend of mine a few years ago spent a lot of time in Kurdistan.  When she returned she tried to buy a lightbulb at a Home Depot and was so overwhelmed by all the choices she had to leave the store. This to me perfectly sums up the dichotomy you would see between the 70s and today.

EliteMiners,felb42t,t1_fejygyg,1579218034.0,"If the prices were kinda stable, say, a three-hour quote, then that could work.  But why go mine resource X at 400,000 CR only to return 90 mins later and the price is 30,000?  That would be maddening. 
And if that's the case, then refineries need to hold two dozen types, since you will be mining everything you find and hope the price is good."
EliteMiners,fel9xdv,t1_fekpqm0,1579217271.0,"I agree ( I prefer exploring myself). But when the prices were fixed, you had incentive to go mine whatever.  Now, with prices fluctuating, why couldn't I just stay at a station, buy low and sell high?  Repeat until I'm rich?  It's not the point of the game, but neither is making 1 billion CR, and yet people have. 
Personally I think a massive correction needs to be made, where the Top Tier ships are as difficult to obtain as a grind to Sag A. Money is only part of it.  Rank, reputation, miles explored, tonnes of resources mined.  Make the Top Tier (and I'm talking about ships not yet in existence) a real Elite trophy."
