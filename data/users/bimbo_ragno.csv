marvelstudios,ff7km7t,t1_ff6w988,1579651782.0,It’s one of my fave scenes in the movie. Jake perfectly pulls off the campy unhinged-ness of the speech
marvelstudios,feuewyk,t1_feu6o3q,1579385898.0,"I thought he was great in Homecoming—still just a sidekick obviously, but he was funny and I liked his relationship with Peter and the fact that he got to be “the guy in the chair” and be a kind of smart hero too. But then in FFH he was pushed off to the side."
marvelstudios,fesnub7,t3_eqicf0,1579367224.0,Love how he does one crappy kid’s movie a few months post-Marvel and suddenly he’s terrible actor lol.
politics,fejdpmr,t1_fej6drq,1579168998.0,"All of my Trump supporting former coworkers are huge animal lovers and constantly donate to rescue organizations and express outrage over dogs being chained up/abused, but have no problem with children being put into cages and separated from their families. Says a lot about them and the way they view brown people, honestly."
marvelstudios,fehqc4x,t1_fehn224,1579121762.0,"The reviews have not been good, that’s for sure."
marvelstudios,feen1h9,t3_eor9ao,1579037069.0,I love how the Spider-Man cast all seem to genuinely get along and be friends with each other outside of filming
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fed434o,t1_fed3ml1,1578997820.0,His wife even chides him and says that’s exactly what people will do lol
marvelstudios,febm5tt,t1_febdb41,1578960267.0,"She only knew that Gamora went with Thanos to Vormir and died there. For all she knows, Thanos could have tortured the info for getting the stone out of Gamora and then killed her, or killed her during a fight if she’d tried to stop him. Nebula didn’t know anything about needing a sacrifice to get the stone."
marvelstudios,feasnsq,t1_feal3yy,1578951884.0,"I completely agree. This was my biggest issue with Endgame. Thanos goes from being an interesting villain with (warped obviously) honor and morality to just another generic Big Bad with a sword villain in Endgame. He doesn’t even know who the Avengers are, which imo takes a lot of the weight out of their fight. 

I remember “leaks” describing a time travel heist that worked more like Back to the Future, where the stones started disappearing from Present Thanos’ gauntlet as the Avengers collected them in the past, and he realizes what’s happening and goes after them. I get why they went with the “branched timelines” instead, but I like how that would have at least preserved the hero-villain relationship"
PaleMUA,fe4hpc6,t1_fe43cj4,1578859448.0,"I’m seconding NYX. I have neutral/cool undertones and have struggled to find a foundation that isn’t chalky white/too yellow/too pink on me, but I finally found the holy grail with NYX. AND it’s so inexpensive."
marvelstudios,fe21q5a,t1_fe10due,1578833536.0,I thought he had the serum but it’s not as good?
marvelstudios,fdqdffb,t1_fdp35qk,1578663720.0,I’m much more inclined to believe that this is the reason why
marvelstudios,fdqaiz1,t1_fdq0zcs,1578661203.0,"FFH was pretty formulaic but it was also a ton of fun with good action scenes and a great villain and a hero we could root for. And honestly, that’s what the audience should hope for with these movies. They’re meant to be blockbuster entertainment movies that sell tickets. They’re never gonna get too niche or experimental. Disney is making billions on these movies by sticking to that formula."
marvelstudios,fdq8bq8,t3_empswb,1578659031.0,"I agree. I think it’s more likely the studio is going to start pushing for the movies to tie in with the Disney+ shows, and I could see some directors balking at that. It also sounds like DS2 (along with WandaVision) is meant to introduce the idea of the multiverse to the greater MCU. It makes me think of Ant Man 2, which was basically just a movie meant to set up the quantum realm time travel stuff for Endgame, and as a result the movie felt pretty lackluster in terms of character development and story. Could be where the “creative differences” thing pops up if Derrickson wanted to do a more character-driven movie."
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fdozwmx,t1_fdoyn9w,1578616701.0,"Same. The visuals were fun but imo Ant Man and FFH did trippy visual sequences even better. Dr. Strange really lacked heart or something and fell flat for me, so this news just kinda makes me shrug"
marvelstudios,fdk0k2r,t3_elsqc8,1578493038.0,"I completely agree about Dr. Strange and Black Panther. Both were total badasses in their ensemble appearances but bored me in their solo outings. Thor was better in ensemble movies until they basically rebooted his character in Ragnarok. That was the first solo movie where it felt like Loki didn’t outshine him. 

I personally find Paul Rudd’s sorta bumbling Ant Man very charming regardless of what movie he shows up in, but I think Endgame was by far his best appearance. He was funny still, but I like that we also got to see his intelligence and he got more emotional meat in that movie. I feel the same way about Spider-Man—he’s always charming and enjoyable, but for me Civil War *nailed* his character, in terms of seeing him as someone who takes responsibility very seriously but is also funny and smart."
FundieSnark,fdghdky,t3_el5rvw,1578396863.0,"I’m convinced the male OBGYN who delivered my first child gave me a “husband stitch” and after that I am personally done with male OBGYNs forever. Obviously if it came down to the safety of my child, I would let the most qualified doctor handle it whatever their gender, but I really think you should have a doctor you feel safe and comfortable with, regardless of your reasons why. You also shouldn’t let smug turds like Birthy shame you into choosing a different doctor (or eschewing one all together.)"
marvelstudios,fde4xu5,t1_fde0piz,1578331272.0,"I still feel sour about like everyone’s ending lol, but especially Cap’s and Natasha’s. I still really enjoyed the movie and loved all the fan service stuff, but yeah..."
FundieSnark,fddfh1c,t1_fdcnkzq,1578309901.0,"It’s so sad to me. I just cut about six inches of my hair off into a short bob yesterday on a whim. I could tell my husband was iffy on the idea, but he would never even dare to tell me no AND he booked my appointment at the hair salon without me having to ask while I was putting our baby down for a nap—because he knows it’s not his damn hair."
FundieSnark,fddf04p,t1_fdctu68,1578309261.0,"I live in a liberal, secular area of the country and I still hear women calling other women “trashy” all the time, which is just a code word for “slutty” (and poor). It’s definitely a problem outside of religious communities too."
AskReddit,fd2xb2y,t1_fd0h9ta,1578152593.0,"I will say it’s a more frequent problem for me post-childbirth, but it still happened before I had kids and I’ve always been thin. It only happens to me if I rip one while lying on my back"
AskReddit,fd2w1z0,t1_fczrc4a,1578152199.0,"I never noticed people seeing a movie alone until I started going alone and actively looked for other solo moviegoers out of curiosity—and there is ALWAYS at least a few other solo viewers in the auditorium with me. So yeah, people should do it. It’s not weird and no one gives a shit."
AskReddit,fd2v5a6,t1_fczg5v5,1578151900.0,I couldn’t work up the courage to do that until I had kids. Now I LOVE leaving my kids with my husband and getting to spend two or three hours completely alone watching a movie. I always go to the theater in the middle of the day on a workday so the auditorium is even emptier. I always see at least a few other people watching solo too. No one gives a shit. Wish I’d started doing it sooner.
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,fcz1oym,t3_ejln1y,1578091885.0,"Nah, he’s said that he did Dolittle for his kids. Sherlock 3 is the movie he seems really invested in, and I doubt that flops. Even if it does, I think he’s done with Marvel. He’s out there doing talks about AI and stuff. He obviously wants time to branch into other projects, including those outside of film."
fatlogic,fcylymq,t1_fcyfg71,1578082460.0,"Yeah, my restrictive ED was caused by OCD. I never thought I was fat and the goal was never to get skinny or “hot”. My busted ass brain just decided that only eating a very small number of food items at very strict times was absolutely necessary or terrible things would happen. The weight loss was just a side effect. I do think that that social pressures can trigger someone who is already susceptible to developing an ED, but this quote seriously misses the mark."
marvelstudios,fct1xl1,t3_eiqcqb,1577930756.0,He was perfect! He was able to pull off the theatrical derangement in a way that was both sinister and hilarious. His monologue in the bar was such a campy absurd delight and it was spot-on for Mysterio. Both MCU Spider-Man movies have nailed the villain honestly.
FundieSnark,fcms8wm,t1_fclvw3i,1577789726.0,They both have small heads. I don’t think any photoshop was used but I do think there’s some kind of weird perspective thing going on
fatlogic,fckxr4w,t1_fciy1d0,1577735459.0,"Yeah I don’t see the point of saying you want to lose weight but nothing is working, then when someone pipes up with helpful advice, you immediately shoot them down. I don’t understand the urge to wallow in your misery."
BadMUAs,fcknccj,t3_ehmkhb,1577729056.0,"Client is beautiful, but that foundation looks almost green on her"
fatlogic,fcib6fv,t1_fci5vyd,1577660011.0,Yeah my mom talks about growing up in the sixties and seventies and eating hamburgers that were the size of your palm (and only eating *one* burger at a meal). That was normal. Portion size has like tripled here in the US.
FundieSnark,fchefq1,t1_fch5kl2,1577649713.0,I was gonna say this dress is a shapeless hideous mess and I would absolutely love to wear it around the house
marvelstudios,fcftazn,t1_fcenufp,1577633522.0,I would argue that the fact that they’re open about their issues is what makes them genuine and down to earth though.
marvelstudios,fcek5nk,t1_fcbekit,1577621268.0,"If she wasn’t actively peddling harmful BS to people, I’d put her on the same level as RDJ. He’s extremely kind and generous, but he’s definitely an eccentric out of touch rich person lol. I think he believes a lot of the same weird “wellness” garbage as Paltrow, but he at least doesn’t sell it to gullible people."
marvelstudios,fcegqsp,t1_fcbtsxo,1577620313.0,"I agree she’s not very smart but she seems to think she is. She’s been called out multiple times on dumb/offensive shit she’s said and instead of giving at least a PR apology, she just doubles down. There are a lot of stupid hills she chose to die on lol"
marvelstudios,fcaymwm,t1_fcaw2qu,1577579207.0,Brie always comes across to me as a ray of sunshine. It boggles my mind when I see people who think she’s like a frigid ice queen or something
marvelstudios,fcayg3g,t1_fcawnqc,1577579098.0,ScarJo is like the definition of out-of-touch rich person lol. She has said so many things over the years that are clueless and entitled at best and downright gross at worst.
fatlogic,fcaxg24,t3_egxihb,1577578533.0,So many people honestly think anorexia is just skipping meals. I struggled with anorexia for a decade as part of my OCD and it is not something I could “schedule.” Scheduling suggests control. Anorexia is the illusion of control
marvelstudios,fcauvu7,t1_fcat7ln,1577577079.0,What? Chris Evans seems like a very humble down to earth guy
