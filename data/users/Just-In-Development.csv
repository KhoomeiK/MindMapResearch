I mean it's not a secret people look down on teenagers so disclosing my age was a mistake. Then I got told I have learning disabilities. Yeah, cool. Not to mention that reading these comments really hurts. I mean am I too weak for life then? I guess it's the same reasoning like my abusive fathers. He always was like ""yoou're just seeking attention"" etc. I just expected a little validation from her, which i've never received. I don't like, want people to praise me for every day I do something, it's quite the opposite.

Maybe I'm just too weak for life. Maybe I'm just trying to avoid the difficult parts of life. Maybe I'm doing all this manipulation unconsciously because my parents rarely forced me to do stuff, so I am not ""prepared"" for work, and I've never had any real problems so I haven't got hardened by those, that's why I am so sensitive, lazy and quick to blame my hard working parent who's been giving all he's got to me, instead of ""grabbing the bull by the horns"" just like everyone else does. And on top of that, I should stop oversharing with my friends because they secretly think of me as a weakling and therefore have lost respect to me.
