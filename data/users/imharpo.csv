His family ""shunned"" him in that they gave him food and water, but refused to look at him or acknowledge him in any way for several weeks. The dog changed his ways and has never bitten them again.

puppy101,fem1sqo,t1_felloo8,1579236972.0,I keep it in my hand sometimes. When I need both hands I let it trail behind him. I have a 10' lead so I can grab it quickly if he goes for something. If he thinks I'm going to chase him the race is on.
puppy101,felfo2g,t3_eprwg8,1579221064.0,"Reminds me of walking in a very large park. No one around. All of a sudden I see a huge Doberman running straight toward me at full speed. I'm not afraid of dogs, but seeing a Doberman running at you is a scary sight. I knew I couldn't run so I just stood there waiting for him to rip my throat out. Then I hear someone yelling from far away ""He won't hurt you!!"" Sure enough, he stopped right when he got to me. Still, brown trousers time.

Maybe you could get a longer training lead so she can still play at the park but you still have the ability to reel her in when necessary?"
puppy101,fej9325,t3_epfw5h,1579162226.0,I started heating up puppy's fleece blanket in the dryer. It worked first try. Now when he sees me put it in the dryer he gets excited and goes right in his crate at night. I usually have to bribe him with a treat otherwise.
puppy101,fej176f,t3_epevdd,1579153217.0,"Yes, I still close the door so he gets used to it and it allows me to get housework done without worrying about him waking up and eating the furniture.

&#x200B;

I use a dehydrated liver treat and say crate and he goes in easily with that. I've tried to just say ""crate"" and ask him to go but he won't unless he sees the treat in my hand. 

&#x200B;

I go to bed really late so he does take a nap after dinner. He has a habit from the very beginning that his last poo is at 11:30pm. This is long after his dinner time so doesn't follow any of the normal ideas of 30 minutes after eating, go figure."

puppy101,fecy6s7,t3_eoie6z,1578989463.0,"Are you using a crate? It is my only savior when my puppy gets out of control. If she is chewing on things you can't leave her out of your sight so you can put her in the crate when you need to do things or keep her on a leash tied to a belt so she follows you around and can't get into things. There was about a month at the beginning where I could not let him out of my sight for even 10 seconds. I'd pour a glass of milk and in that amount of time he'd either peed on something or chewed on something he shouldn't. Try to find out what she likes to chew on, if it's hard things or soft things and keep them handy to distract from the biting issue. Good luck. I know it's hard."

puppy101,feaejp2,t1_feadpn2,1578947719.0,At that age they are still waking up to pee in the night so while they are going potty you can throw the blanket back in the dryer for a couple minutes. It really made a big difference for him. He's a Boston and doesn't have much fur so he's a sucker for a warm spot.
puppy101,feae6tq,t3_eo7xgu,1578947528.0,Be prepared for nonstop biting. I've had many kinds of dogs in my lifetime and nothing prepared me for the onslaught of my new Bostie. I don't know if it's a breed thing or not but I wasn't prepared for that and it was upsetting at first. Definitely plan on using a crate so you have somewhere to get forced naps.
puppy101,feadgdy,t3_eo87iw,1578947303.0,I found an easier solution. Right before I put him in the crate I put a hand towel or his fleece blanket in the dryer. It made a HUGE difference for him going right to sleep. I put the blanket in his crate and he runs in there to get on the toasty warm bed. Now he has stopped peeing in his crate so I have a bed in there but if it's cold I can still heat up a towel and lay it on the bed.

puppy101,fdfsmhs,t3_el3kbi,1578369194.0,I've seen several good trainers suggest not going to dog parks at all. If you go often enough you will see horrible fights and injuries and you have no control over who brings what kind of dog in. It's a gamble.
puppy101,fdfs9al,t3_el5cam,1578368935.0,"I have my first Boston puppy but I've raised other types of dogs in the past and none of them ever had so much trouble holding their urine. My little guy pees many times. He will usually go in 3's, so even if I got him to pee outside he would still go several more times in the house. I don't know if this is normal for Bostons or if it's just him but I had to give up hope of housebreaking him quickly and had to keep going with the pee pads. I still take him outside and praise and give rewards when he does go outside but I've stopped expecting him to do something that he clearly isn't physically ready to do. I've seen him pee 6 times in less than an hour. I would have to live outside to catch all those and often there isn't even enough time to react and be able to get his harness and leash on, get dressed for foul weather, get him outside in the cold in time before it would just run out of him.

I guess my only tip is to go easy on yourself and your puppy and go with the flow, so to speak."
