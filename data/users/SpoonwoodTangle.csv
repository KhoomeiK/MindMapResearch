AskReddit,ff90m6p,t3_es8f05,1579701811.0,"Climate change, because the physical / chemical systems of the planet underpin *all* of the biological systems. There are a couple of “core” scary problems with climate change: 

1. All the farms. Agriculture depends on weather, and most of our food is grown outdoors. But that’s not all. 

Huge tracks of agricultural land exist in transition zones between deserts and wetter environs. Irrigation provides reliable water for crops, but certain weeds and pests can’t survive. It’s a great strategy to escape damaging fungi, insects, etc. But climate change is driving desertification, which means less total arable land even as crops are stressed and produce less. This is already causing conflict and competing pressures on land use, which can exacerbate global warming by causing more deforestation, etc. 

2. Disease spread. A lot of folk have rightly pointed to antibiotic resistance. But the vectors for things like malaria and TB are moving or spreading as the weather expands or restricts their range. Mosquitoes now inhabit altitudes and latitudes where they have never been seen before, and TB is spreading into cities where contour campaigns don’t currently exist because it was not previously a problem. Rinse and repeat for a lot of diseases, even the annual flu season is harder to predict, the best vaccines more difficult to roll out, because they don’t spread the way they used to. 

3. Economic productivity. Everything going into the economy, even our own labor, begins with natural resources. Think about fuel, food (calories), and raw materials processed into higher value products. Natural systems underpinning raw resources have always been variable, and that variability has always impacted people in a variety of ways, good and bad. Societies have risen and fallen on (un)favorable rains alone. And when things go sour, societies struggle to adapt and conflict ensues. 

If people have been struggling to adapt under relatively “stable” climatic conditions, what happens when those systems kick into overdrive? A 5year drought turns into a 10year drought. A major flood turns into a historic flood. How many times do people rebuild before packing up and moving? And moving where? Their neighbor’s land? This is already happening, from Louisiana to Alaska, and across the globe .

People say that climate change is a slow moving disaster, but tell that to South Carolina, which has had a number of unprecedented record-breaking natural disasters within a few years. Or to absent or abhorrent monsoon seasons. Or unending droughts, fires, etc. 

Climate change can move fast, when it wants to. 

The reason I nominate it is because of its scope and reach. It touches on so many things that impact our lives today, and can seriously endanger individuals, communities, and societies on multiple fronts. We don’t have the money, the organization, or the knowledge to fight all of these threats, or to keep recovering if bad luck keeps dealing us bad hands."

Ive had makeup conversations like yours before and I usually file them away as advice for the rare special occasion when I do wear makeup.

The kid might laugh, stare at you, or keep wailing depending on how deep they’ve fallen into a meltdown. But the message still gets through. 

This is a good strategy because with a little savvy you can do it to almost any kid without confronting or offending the parent. Also it’s more or less constructive for the kid. 

If you’re worried about the parent reacting, just exaggerate more to the point of silliness."
AskReddit,fdqz47b,t1_fdqnhqy,1578677161.0,"Definitely this. 

Solution: make exaggerated, even silly mean faces at kids when they misbehave. Including anger, sadness, surprise, outrage, etc. This is how they learn at a young age. This can be done to almost any kid without being rude to the parent, when in doubt exaggerate it out.

Why this actually works (tldr at bottom):

The part of your brain where you can control your emotions doesn’t grow in until kids are like 4 or 5, and doesn’t finish growing until you’re much older. 

Kids literally can’t help it and sometimes life means even a great parent loses control. 

Something annoying or uncomfortable for a grownup is *the end of the world* or unbearably painful for toddlers. It might be the first time ever they’ve encountered something and they have zero idea how to handle it. Default is crying. Loudly.

That’s before you throw consideration for manipulation. Infants as young as 4-6mo can and will manipulate adults around them. They’re basically baby psychopaths because - again - those bits of the brain haven’t come in yet. 

The messed up thing is that we’re generally programmed to sympathize and take care of kids. Adults are definitely at the biological disadvantage, and *we have to be* or most babies would never survive their first months.

That includes each and every one of us that was once a squalling, shitting fuck prize.

This is what I tell myself when a kid is driving me nuts. So far, it has kept me out of trouble. So far. 

TLDR; kids don’t have the brain bits yet to f-ing control themselves so they can’t help it. Also they’re manipulative bastards. This is 100% a survival strategy."

1. Needed high certainty in its reliability. As the only owner I’m confident it’s been maintained well. I have not had good experiences with used cars in the past, even after having them looked over by someone knowledgeable.

2. No anticipation of resale. I’m going to drive this thing into the ground, so taking the value hit when I drive off the new car sales lot is irrelevant. 

3. I really wanted heated seats. The siren song called me and I crashed myself upon the rocks! I couldn’t be sure to get a make / model with that feature, within a tight deadline, on the used car market. If I’d had more time to search, maybe... but that’s how it panned out."

It was ~1hr of jogging per cookie.

Edit: suggested serving size was two cookies. That’s like a whole meals worth of calories"
AskReddit,fdhia1v,t3_eldh9a,1578423224.0,"When I was really young I used to say “Oceanographer” because it sounded super smart and adults liked it. Also I thought it involved dolphins.

Then I learned what it really was and still-young me thought it sounded boring. I think I switched to the default “astronaut” for a while."
AskReddit,fdf0mgw,t3_ekx7gi,1578350625.0,"True story: 

I was lost on a country road in the North Carolina mountains on a dark and stormy night; a cop pulled me over. I asked, “Was I speeding officer?” 

“You nearly hit an elk.” 

So I my dumb ass replied, “There are no elk in North Carolina.” 

Apparently there are, but I’ve never seen one. Got away with a warning and some good directions home."

On a serious note, it looks happy, I’d feed it and give it a sniff. If it smells right, maybe a small taste. It might be just fine. I hope some more knowledgeable folk also weigh in"

Edit: keep it in strict quarantine if you have any other orchids. Wash your hands after handling it and keep it in a different room. Don’t let water, knife blade, anything that touches this one touch any others. If you notice any kind of mold, discard outside immediately"

TwoXChromosomes,fc15dm5,t1_fc0lzcx,1577308733.0,"Not an unreasonable question. 

I’d argue 50% cultural convention - wrapping / obscuring the gift in something other than the take-away bag it was delivered in is the long-standing local norm. 

I’m happy arguing that if someone is giving a gift - barring extenuating circumstances (please see OP) - with no personal inconvenience to themselves, then the effort taken or not taken becomes a statement. 

Can’t be bothered to take two extra seconds? Yes. It hurts."
TwoXChromosomes,fc0861v,t1_fc04kvl,1577282581.0,I’d be a lot less hurt if they’d bothered to tie the plastic bag closed.
TwoXChromosomes,fc083pm,t1_fc04lfy,1577282510.0,"Its not about wrap vs bag for me. Put it in a gift bag and shove some tissue paper on top. That’s perfect!

The supplies were free and available in the same room, and refused. So one of my Christmas presents is just in a plastic bag, not even tied closed. I can see what it is through the plastic. I appreciate the gift, but the manner of delivery hurt my feelings."
TwoXChromosomes,fc070gb,t1_fc04twp,1577281290.0,The example offered above was placing the item in a gift bag and adding tissue paper. We’re not talking about learning how to tie a bow with ribbon here.

If a big group of my family or friends go out for dinner or brunch, it’s going to be a 3+ hour meal similar to what you described. Especially if someone is visiting from out of town. 

Whereas a lunch may be quick so folk can get back to work or to their next weekend engagement. 

Whereas a happy hour after work might be light on either food or drink and may last 1-3 hours, depending on what kind of night you’re having,"
