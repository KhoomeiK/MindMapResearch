Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something, but that's exactly how it behaves. Whilst you do have the option of 'Tresorit Drive', to browse other-wise offline storage, you can still go into the Tresorit app, and sync, or selective sync, to a local folder, and that content is then synced locally, in the background - as it is with dropbox. This is the exact way i use is, as my main PC has room for everything, but my Macbook pro just has a couple of projects sync'd"

sydney,ff1p2f9,t3_er44d7,1579483016.0,"That year-on-year rate is scary.

My understanding is that levels below 15% are unusable. So that gives you not much more than 12 months based on current usage / similar rainfall.

What's also a worry, is that the last month usage (with L2 restrictions) was higher than the average for the last 12 months

unRAID,febyakg,t3_eocryl,1578964221.0,"The CyberPower SineWave range are great value UPS's. They work great with the unRaid UPS Widget, showing draw, runtime etc. They're True Sinewave rather than Stepped Sinewave (safer for sensitive equipment, though don't know how much that matters in the real-world), and a much better price that APC.

Main drawback though is that although the widget works fine, it doesn't trigger a graceful shutdown in unRaid (Well, not for me, and not found anyone it works for yet!). For short power outages, that's fine as the UPS will carry it through, but for prolonged outages, you'll need to intervene and perform the shutdown. But it's saved my server a number of times!

I have a 900w/1500va UPS. Attached to this i have my unRaid Server (with 20 HDDs & 4 SSD's attached to a workstation grade board/processor), my Desktop, which is a fairly powerful machine with a 1920x threadripper in it, all my UNIFI network equipment, my ARLO camera base, and my 38in 21:9 monitor.

Assuming everything is more or less just idling (but powered on nonetheless), I get a 260w load and 32min run time from the UPS. If I spin up all disks, and start ANNO 1800 on my PC, I'm getting a 333w load. And shutting down the PC and spinning down the disks, I'm at 140w. So don't feel like you need to go overboard with a crazy 2000w UPS for a couple of pieces of consumer equipment (unless you know you're maxing out the draw)"

>Faced with an oversupply, rather than halt the collection, which had turned out to be a unifying effort for the country and of great propaganda value, the government allowed it to continue. The ironwork collected was stockpiled away from public view in depots, quarries, railway sidings. After the war, even when raw materials were still in short supply, the widely held view is that the gaovernment \[sic\] did not want to reveal that the sacrifice of so much highly valued ironwork had been in vain, and so it was quietly disposed of, or even buried in landfill or at sea.

3. Ensure you have a mix of diagnosis rooms. You may start off with general diagnosis and cardio, but these should get replaced with DNA, Scanner, X-Ray, and then CLOSE General Diagnosis & Cardio - you don't need them anymore

IdiotsInCars,fct8s64,t1_fct7lij,1577935916.0,"I couldn't find directly comparable numbers for the UK in my 15 minute search, but did manage to find, for both UK & USA, the number of *pedestrian* deaths in children under 15

In the UK, there were 33, which is a rate of 0.5 per million population

In the US, there were 245, which is a rate of 0.8 per million population

I'm not saying the idea of the bus stopping is necessarily bad, but by your own numbers, and by the pedestrian death rate, it's not entirely effective - kids need to be taught to look before they cross, and for that they need to be able to SEE the roadway clearly - I don't know how that's possible if they're expected/taught to cross from in front of a parked bus - something we explicitly teach our children not to do.

&#x200B;

Edit: And to your other point - you say it perfectly - we teach our kids the danger AND then take preventative steps as well. Don't play with medicine, and then keep it out of reach etc. Same here - nothing wrong with the traffic stopping - but that's not a substitute to teaching them road safety - which it *literally* the point I made"

IdiotsInCars,fct6pzf,t1_fct2pqr,1577934315.0,"Does this not just create a false sense of security for kids? If it becomes second nature to get off a bus and just cross the road, what happens when they're on a public bus? Is it not better to teach proper road sense?

Australia does have *some* rules (although varies by states), eg in NSW buses do have flashing lights, and if they're flashing you have to slow down to 40kph - I think these are used at the driver's discretion as to whether he has a lot of school kids on the bus. Also, all schools have a 'school zone' where the speed limit is 40kph at certain times of the day.

I'm not aware of any standard rules in the UK - bus stops for school kids (and bus stops in general) would usually just be designed not to be in high-speed locations in the first place."

Not really. A pack of 16 paracetamol from the supermarket is 40p (50c), so 2 packs per month = $1, so you're spending $12 per year. (and that's based on going through all 32 per month)

sydney,fcil354,t3_efpybz,1577664360.0,"I'm likely showing my naïvety here...

last few years, we've been to Clarke's Point - which has had a nice, relaxed family theme to it - picnic blanket, chairs etc in our little trolly. We would then just stay for the 9pm fireworks

This year I'm just taking the older children, and see the midnight fireworks (for the first time), so the wife suggested I take them to Bradfield Park (Milson's Point), as there were still tickets.

Now, I know it's going to be super busy (i'm not *that* naive), but does that also mean it's a 'no' to bringing a picnic blanket & some grub? The ticket says max bag size 60x40x25 - which isn't a lot. Not fussed about chairs, and was never going to bring alcohol - but are we risking being turned away if we have a rucksack + couple of carry items?"
sydney,fcie87w,t3_eh4evn,1577661224.0,"It's a *nice* zoo.

We opted for annual passes, as $200 for the year for all 5 of us makes it a cheap day out for the rest of the year.

The zoo covers a fairly large footprint, but because the exhibits are quite large, there's isn't *loads* to see (compared to Taronga) - those saying 1.5-2 hours are probably about right - we spent 2 hours - didn't eat, but sat down for an ice cream.

I can understand why that may seem 'short', but it makes sense for us - with Taronga it's a full day that you have to commit to and on a hot day it's too long to be out for (especially with young children). Sydney Zoo can be a last-minute decision for something to do in the afternoon.

Plus, there are a few exhibits not yet open, so it'll improve in the coming months.

Personally, I think I prefer featherdale, just a few mins away. Much smaller, and doesn't have the 'big ticket' animals - mostly Australian wildlife, but you get up close to everything, lots to see etc - we spend longer there than we did Sydney Zoo."
