I just see it all the time around here, a new house going up in the framing stage and there are covered patios with posts up on footings before patios are poured.  Patio slabs should be part of the building structure, but its more complicated and expensive to do that way, which is why its less common.  To do it right you should have brick ledges on the house side and a grade beam down to frost on the outside.  Fair amount of cost for a more ""budget"" house."

HomeImprovement,fdkn976,t1_fdkmcs3,1578507099.0,"I'm in the midwest and almost every patio I've seen similar to OPs is just a floating slab.

The slab was poured around the post from what I can tell, and I'm sure there is no reinforcing in the slab between the post and the outside edges of the concrete.  So on the outside edges you have a couple of inches between the post and yard of solid concrete.  It was an incredibly weak part of the slab from day one and exactly where I would expect cracks.  It doesn't take a lot of movement to crack concrete. 

If the post is sitting on the slab thats a different deal, but from what I can tell the post was installed and then they poured the patio around/up to it."
HomeImprovement,fdkj6r4,t1_fdkhev5,1578504844.0,"Patios are almost never structural slabs (footings under entire perimiter), they are just floating slabs.  A post like OP is showing HAS to have a footing.  So you've got a footing and post that are solid.  Around that you have a slab that is poured as floating.  The slab is going to move a bit and react to freeze thaw while the structural pieces are going to stay put. This is going to cause the slab to crack. 

Personally I wouldn't be concerned about that post if I were op, I would just verify the post is still plumb and the beam is level.  The corner cracking is just from a bad detail."
HomeImprovement,fdkfud6,t1_fdkdxzn,1578502978.0,"It looks like they poured the concrete slab around the pillar, it doesn't appear to be sitting on the slab.  There is likely a footing below the pillar and slab.
