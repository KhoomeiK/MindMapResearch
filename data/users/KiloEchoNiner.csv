DestinyTheGame,fdzqipo,t3_en6lg5,1578793472.0,"Yup. D1Y1 vet that took a break last season. I bought this season and I completely regret it. I should have stayed on my break.

The Sundial is the same old bullshit with a different coat of paint. The FOMO style of content releases are oppressively unforgiving to the point where I can’t bring myself to care about it anymore. Even though I LOVE what I experienced in the Saint-14 quest line.

The “rewards” are lackluster. (LFRs for the Crucible “ritual” weapon. Really? REALLY?!)

Eververse is overly oppressive. We get it, you have to make money, but y’all are worse than Activision. Seriously.

The artifact’s core functionality wasn’t iterated on this season, and is completely underwhelming compared to last season imo.

IB is a complete waste of a once immensely enjoyable game mode. The same goes for crucible too with the slowness of sandbox updates, lack of new (good) modes (looking at you lockout, and bring back Rift you *actual* cowards), etc.

And to top it all off, we keep seeing the same core problems resurface in nearly every single content release and we keep hearing, “we’re listening.” Nah, Bungie. SOME of you are listening, but the people that build the modes, create the quests, and create the weapons / armor sure as shit aren’t.

It’s at this point that what I have come to expect out of Bungie is not what they are able to produce. I know what they are capable of. We’ve all seen it, but this yo-yo from nigh masterpiece to utter disappointment is happening too much for my tastes."
