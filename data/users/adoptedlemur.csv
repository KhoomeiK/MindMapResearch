AmItheAsshole,fdlv05p,t1_fdluklu,1578533133.0,"That you know. Maybe what you see as lazyness is an incapability of stepping into a gym without feeling anxious or being around peers without drinking. Maybe there are underlying issues. 

Please don’t take offense, but if this post is representative of your parenting style, i’d bet money on your son having deep emotional stuff to work through."

AmItheAsshole,fdlu8b5,t3_em1x8d,1578532611.0,"YTA. I totally get your rationale and why you would let it drive your actions. Please realize that you are trying to bully someone into changing a situation they are already failing to change. It can be stressing. 

Please try to be supportive by not doubting he is doing his best. Help him by sinply helping him, if that makes sense?"

AmItheAsshole,fcx4w89,t3_eje8ck,1578051343.0,"NTA - having kids stay with relatives is a common and practical thing to do. Make sure you explain the process to your daughter and include her in the family event that is bringing a new member of the family to the world so she doesn’t, in fact, feel discarded/set aside."
AmItheAsshole,fcv33y9,t3_ej2rhp,1577993653.0, YTA. So very much the asshole.
