Wishlist,ffmmb0k,t1_ffmf7hh,1580056612.0,I’ll be interested to see how your raincoat turns out!
Wishlist,ffmdube,t1_ffmcptb,1580053125.0,"Worse, vinyl!  When I make a pattern that I’ll use repeatedly, like a hummingbird, I cut a pattern from a thin vinyl school folder and use it forever to trace my pieces onto glass.  I save them in small plastic bags.  You might find it helpful in the future.  It works great, but not great for my good fabric scissors.  But thanks to you, now I’ll have a beautiful new pair set aside in my sewing cabinet."
Wishlist,ffmbd6n,t1_ffluwmu,1580051786.0,Oooooh!  I ruined my sewing scissors cutting out stained glass patterns so these are very exciting!  But you didn’t need to!
Wishlist,ffmb995,t1_fflvhqc,1580051714.0,"Oh my goodness, girl, there was no need!  This hand cream is the best.  The thing about stained glass is it can be tough on your hands and I go through this stuff pretty quickly, so you might want to try it at some point, too."
Wishlist,ffj3g9u,t1_ffijqur,1579989418.0,Would you like some small bits of beautiful paper that I’ve saved?  Pm me your address if you do.  I’d like them to be used and enjoyed.
