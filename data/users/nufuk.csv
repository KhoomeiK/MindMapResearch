BUT more importantly you(me) are not everyone's type, so it doesn't matter. Sometimes people are just not attracted to a certain look and style and there is nothing someone can do about."

And you can not convince other, you can confront them with how it is and then hope that they will some day think about it and change their behavior. Such big decisions (except for weird dietary vegans) is a process which the person has to do by itself. I hope I could transport my message and how I think people become vegans."

vegancirclejerk,fejdgck,t1_fejdbdr,1579168612.0,I generally think it is not possible to convince anyone since they believe they are right and it is their uttermost believe they are superior to other beings. And firefighters always risk their lives which is really nice. But it is unnecessary since they risk their live because people behave like shit. If some one burns down your house you can still thank the firefighters and blame the person who started the fire.

vegancirclejerk,fegvuh4,t1_fegvls2,1579103682.0,Weird thing but k guess it is not possible in Germany to legally eat such animals. Because all animals are protected here by our constitution (20a) so you are not allowed to kill animals and stuff (crickets tho?) Except you are a hunter or kill millions.
vegancirclejerk,fegviti,t1_fegv62c,1579103474.0,My cousin asked me why I ate cow and not dogs years ago which ruined and made me vegan. And I still don't have an answer so I still stick to it untill I find a reason why
