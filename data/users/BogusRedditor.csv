offmychest,feo4tga,t3_epy2sr,1579295080.0,"Yah, I work in the marine industry, we seem to be 20 years behind the times and still sea (see what I did there?) alot of that behavior, even though women are more and more part of our crews. Age too, as a male supervisor under 35, I get alot of the old boys bullshit.

Stay strong, there are so many successful women out there fighting the good fight (many that I have been more the happy to work for myself, including my wife who is a Chief Engineer). I am pulling for yah!"
needadvice,fek4ti6,t3_epdtks,1579192622.0,"Death is a scary thing, in my work place we come upon it and usually its an industrial accident or an accident while on vacation. Usually not pretty and is high stress, but it is my job to help the injured, and if I am able to give families closure (wear your lifejackets ladies and gents, not for you but for your loved ones. Not knowing is worse the knowing.)

I rationalize my fear to handle any impulses. I sit down and ask why I am afraid, and mentally study my physical and mental responses. Usually comes down to ""of course I am afraid, this is my body saying you should be paying attention"", then I start paying attention. If I am being honest I spend most days being afraid of something, but by studying my fear I respond rather then react. And don't knock yourself too hard, in this world where Darwin is hard at work with some of the shit you see around, a strong survival and fear response isn't a bad thing, just might need a little re-adjusting. Stay strong!"

offmychest,fehxc8e,t3_ep0i75,1579125735.0,"I agree that there are problems with modern law enforcement in North America, but my experience shows that the people that bitch about the police either never have had to apply use of force and as a result have no idea what they are talking about or simply would never have the fortitude or ability to be a cop, or to become a cop with the idea that they are going to make a change in their community.

You know what works, and what is proven around the world (by around the world I mean many other countries besides the US)? People working with the police and police working with the people. Community policing models, laws that help criminals re-intergrate, communities that are not afraid to stand up to incorrect and illegal law enforcement but still stand up to work with police because law enforcement is important. Rather then bitch, solve the problem. Lord Peel said 'The people are the police and the police are the people"". It takes two groups to alienate one another, but it takes one person to hold out a hand. Many LEOs and their departments see the problems and are trying to make the changes, but they can't do it without the community, and the community can't have law and order without the police. One requires the other ladies and gents. Perhaps we need to start fresh?"

He could have gone that way but selected the non violent way. And he got hurt for it. Domestic violence is a real thing, this guy didn't deserve any of that shit."
tifu,feefe41,t3_eomyn9,1579032628.0,LoL I work with marine radio and its always a good time to hear what people come up with when they forget.
offmychest,fee0f62,t3_eof3bt,1579023761.0,"Wow. That is a scary thing. As a first-responder in my work place I am familiar with how terrible triage can be in mass casualty situations, and how much worse it gets where there is still a life threat in the area. Admittedly I had never thought of it in terms of a school. This hurts my heart just to know its happening, even though its important to teach these skills. No student should have to see this kind of  tragedy, much less any other human being.

As a gun owner, I just don't understand how people can be against some simple liscensing and oversight to ensure that guns are in the right hands. Its easy for everyone to say just ban all, but it comes down to government lack of will and courage to make a brave decision and a public that is so afraid of losing their rights that they will not work towards a common good. Why can't we all take responsibility and look at the world around us?  And who suffers? These educators and children that are our future. I am so sorry you had to deal with this. My heart goes out to you and your students."
tifu,feazhiu,t3_eoa87v,1578953868.0,Bravo good sir!
tifu,feaz0re,t3_eo9xto,1578953720.0,"LoL I would say that if you aren't having fun it is your own fault, but in this sticky situation it may call for an alternative saying. That being said good for you for taking the chance on it!"
offmychest,fear5jn,t3_eo4j99,1578951486.0,"Glad to hear that you are getting help, but like so many have said its your hard work in the end! You should be proud of your strength!

It is always hard to get help, but we are all stronger when we get it. Mine says that I should 'celebrate the shower' as in at least I got out of bed, but not punishing yourself is so important. 

So here's to your strength, and the kindness and insight of all those to that have helped you find it along the way! Cheers!"
offmychest,fe58xsg,t3_enscih,1578866646.0,"As a Canadian I hear you loud and clear. I won't excuse Mr. Trump, but even with the current foreign policy its the Iranian government who should be held responsible for their actions in this case. Trump is already being taken to task by his own government and the world at large, let democracy play its part. As for the Iranians, it saddens me that a government that wants to sit so high on the world stage that it would handle this incident so poorly and expect to be respected by other governments and their citizens. A commercial plane doesn't have a damn thing to do with the assassination of a an Iranian general, even one as 'contentious' as  Soleimani."
offmychest,fe56rg2,t3_enm237,1578866114.0,"One thing I know for  sure is if you don't ask you will never know, and that can be its own form of personal torment. Sounds like he is a good ""human being"", as in skip the guy part and get right to the good part.  Every rule has its exceptions, do you want to go down not knowing? I wouldn't. Be brave, this could be the next chapter!"
offmychest,fe4xco9,t3_enr6fr,1578863698.0,Its too easy to forget ourselves. Good luck going forward.
offmychest,fe3ebki,t3_eno7cj,1578848490.0,"This is very true. Even if you aren't young, it is a huge risk to get married quick. I was married at 25 after 3 months of knowing my wife. We struggle alot, probably wouldn't have struggled so much if we had taken our time, maybe we would be closer right now. I mean, if ifs and buts were candied nuts we would all be fat, and I love her, but facts are facts."
offmychest,fe3dbb9,t3_enmfm4,1578848273.0,Sorry for your loss my friend.

offmychest,fe3bzfo,t3_enknog,1578847938.0,"I used to do Loss Prevention for Wally's, definitely tell an employee. The LP team and management will do what they can to help. Ass-clowns like that are bad for business. At least then a tresspass order can be issued and it is safer for anyone, and of course we were always there to help.

Sorry you had to experience that, nobody should feel afraid to just go shopping. Please stay safe."
