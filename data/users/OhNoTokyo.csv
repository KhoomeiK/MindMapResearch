I said ""overcritical"".  We do discuss how useful birth control measures will be.

My problem with pro-choicers is that they act as though you have to support every possible program they can think of if it has the mere side effect of possibly reducing abortions.  Now *that* would be single issue voting.  

>You don't understand that making abortion illegal is a means to an end. The real goal is stopping abortions.

Stopping abortions is part of the end.  A very important part, obviously.  But just as important is opposing the principle that it is even a solution which can be acceptable at any time except for pure self-defense.

We're (probably) never going to end abortions totally.  Someone's going to find a way to kill their child though pure fear, malice, or just insanity just like they do with their born children sometimes.  

For that reason, it's almost as important how we go about doing it, and changing attitudes about acceptability and fostering a mindset where it is not seen as even remotely acceptable.  Which it is not.

>BC realises this, and pro-lifers should've supported it.

That is an opinion that you can legitimately argue.  And many do.  It's not likely to change the opinions of those against it, since they tend to be rooted in stated philosophical objections, such as that by the Catholic Church.  

>Yes and this means they are subsidising money to those who can't afford abortion otherwise, it's not money that goes towards any abortion providers, they are not getting extra money.

I am not certain you understand what you wrote there.  Subsidizing people to get abortions is the same as providing extra money to them to get abortions.  Who cares if it goes to some provider?  Do you think I give a fig about abortion providers aside from the fact that they provide abortions?

I don't want people to be able to afford abortions any more than I want people to be able to afford hiring a hit man to kill someone else.  I don't even know why you think that would make this better in the slightest?"

I think it is valid to assess whether they're causing more harm than good with their position, but in the end who is going to vote with me to outlaw abortion?  You or them?  

Its hard for me to become overcritical of groups that have actually taken concrete pro-life action in relation to those who just want free birth control which just happens to have abortion reduction as a side effect.

Okay.  There may be hypocrites among us.  Happens in every group.  I wonder why you're bothering to point it out.  Is there some action that should be taken?

Enforcing some sort of orthodoxy on pro-lifers when it comes to birth control is not likely to happen nor end well.  There's more we have to lose by getting into a schism about that then we do with one or two of these programs being batted down.

If I insist that it is my way or the highway for every person who disagrees with me on this or that program, I'm going to be a party of one pretty quickly.

In my opinion, the best and most effective means of cutting down on abortions is removing its current legality.  I can also vote for such birth control measures as I have the ability to vote for on the side.

Now, if people are doing shit like killing abortionists in the name of ""pro-life"" activism, I'm going to come down hard on that because they're no better than those who they're attacking.  

>Yes but I already explained, providing BC is a huge step in this direction and doing so is not mutually exclusive to banning abortion as a whole.

Abortiondebate,ffa6yc6,t1_ffa1pm3,1579729080.0,">It's just plain hypocrisy. It's as if you see a vegetarian (for ethical reasons) beating a cat.

Does one vegetarian beating a cat mean that vegetarianism is wrong?  Does that even mean that they aren't vegetarian?  Being bad at your chosen ethics is not a condemnation of the ethics, it doesn't even mean that they aren't vegetarian.  

If this person hates cats so much that they exclude that species from ethical consideration, but still follows the rest of the practice of ethical vegetarianism or veganism, are they no longer vegan or vegetarian?  

I suppose there is a line where you have to say, this guy doesn't represent this position, but that's not a cut and dried situation.  Trying to enforce orthodoxy is probably more counterproductive than banning birth control because it invites in-fighting between people who still hold rather similar goals.

For instance, I do not believe there should be a rape exception for abortions, because I feel it misses the point about why abortion is wrong.   Rape is especially terrible in that situation, but the child is completely innocent of the crime.

However, many pro-lifers disagree and allow themselves to envision a rape exception.  I disagree with this every chance I get, but I wouldn't go so far as to say they aren't pro-lifers. 

 In the same way, it may be better to have birth control available, but I can't suggest that I get to define orthodoxy when it comes to the means to our goal, because it isn't my goal to save any one life, it is to end a practice that kills people.  I will never be able to save every life I want to, even if I get my way in terms of abortion legislation.

In the Royal Navy and some others, Post Captains basically had ""tenure"".  They were placed on a seniority list and as they moved up the list they would be considered in command if they were in company with a lower ranked Post Captain on the list.  Promotions to Admiral rank were strictly based on your seniority on that list and you were guaranteed that promotion if you remained in the Navy long enough to fill an opening left by a previous admiral.  

This did not always result in commands, though, and captains who were not considered very good, or who weren't in favor with the Admiralty were often given their promotions and stuck on land without a command thenceforth.  

Commanders had no such seniority and no guarantee of any promotion.  It was a useful step on the way to Post Captain, but they would find themselves on Commander's half-pay forevermore if they couldn't get a post ship."

Uh.  No.  I believe that your birth control program may work, but will probably have diminishing returns over the long term, and if the people who believe that birth control policy encourages pro-abortion attitudes are right, then it may well advance the number of abortions in the long term.  

You're extrapolating a massive cut to abortion rates from one program targeted at one segment of the population to cover the entire country and expecting that it will have durable results in the long term.  I don't see your proof for that.  

That means to me that while you might be right, those other people might be right as well.  

No one is arguing that if you make it easier for people to get condoms and IUDs that there may be fewer pregnancies, but no one is answering how far that goes.

What I am telling you is that you need to understand that being pro-life isn't about attaining some specific number of abortions as much as it is about ending what we could call ""a culture of death"" and a lack of recognition of human rights in favor of moral convenience.

No one is suggesting that saving lives is not desirable, but we do get to ask what costs are incurred in the long run in any one approach.  

If, for instance, I suggested that we enact a police state which monitored women obsessively for any evidence of possible abortion, you could argue that this would be effective at reducing abortions.

It has everything to do with this discussion.  I do not admit of any valid reason for abortion except the life of the mother.  You *think* you're compromising, but to me your asking me to be happy with you for killing fewer people.

That's the problem with your position.  There is only one legitimate need for an abortion: the health of the mother.  The rest of these ""needs"" are not sufficient to justify the killing of a human being.  The fact that you don't acknowledge that is a bigger problem than birth control, since you will elect people and support groups who continue to normalize and promote abortions.

In short, you're not interested in ending abortions, you're only interested in trying to cut a deal with us so that we don't affect pet projects that have other aims than we have.  

>You just want to decrease abortion rates

I don't *just* want to decrease abortion rates.  I want to end abortion, period.  I know that will likely never happen entirely, but it needs to not only stop happening, it needs to stop being acceptable to us to use as a society.  The number of killings is only half of the story.  The fact that we consider it to be an acceptable solution at all is also entirely unacceptable and just as much a problem as the killings.

While the attitude persists that it is acceptable, the problem will just return or be supported underground.

While I will personally not argue against harmless methods of reducing abortions, such as reducing poverty and increasing education, issues hitting the reproductive process itself, like birth control promotion could definitely be argued to be an area where you can ultimately shoot yourself in the foot if you want to actually end abortions because you allow the goal to simply be reduction rather than eradication."
Abortiondebate,ff6epcv,t1_ff6cbot,1579625576.0,">I mean answer me this: would you rather live in a world where abortion rates go down with 50% but people have a mindset you don't agree with, or abortion rates stay the same?

Abortion rates won't go down 50% due to that, which is a point I already covered.  As it stands what you're talking about is 50% of 10% representing the number of people who don't use birth control.  At best the plan reduces abortion by 5%, I'd suggest that it's more likely something like 2-3% owing to the fact that education and availability does not represent the only reason that people don't use BC.

Second, consider that if you look at the long term, if such programs contribute to societal normalization of viewpoints which encourage abortion-positive thinking, then you will lose any gains you got with the short term reduction of abortions through the persistence of legalized abortion as acceptable and supported in society.

If you cut abortions by 50% indirectly via BC but never even attempt to end abortion itself, you will have a dramatic drop followed by long term sustained abortions.  Over decades, the initial drop will be long overwhelmed by the smaller, but persistent number of abortions per year.  So...

600K ... 300K ... 300K ... 300K ... ad infinitum.

Whereas a program which works more slowly but works to stop abortions as a primary goal may well have a progression as follows:

600K ... 550K ... 500K ... 450K ... etc.  

Over some period of time, more will die, but it will be fewer every year until it reaches a point where it reaches some minimum level.  

While I don't necessarily disagree that BC can be part of that long term plan, you need to understand that pro-choicers attempting to suggest that they're better pro-lifers than we are isn't going to be taken seriously.  You don't actually care whether abortion is removed, you're just attempting to point to short term solutions to suggest that we aren't sincere.

Part of the answer is make sure and train yourself to try and remain full, but only on things that provide proper nutrition, and certainly drink water.

But also, the best thing that you can do for yourself is designate meal times where you do not even approach food unless you are there to do it in order to provide nutrition.  

Maintain discipline and create a habit.  Remain mindful that any time that you are even thinking about going to get any of that food, it's unnecessary and causing you an issue.  

Although this is not the healthiest way of dealing with the issue, some video games have caused me to become so absorbed in playing that I simply forget to eat until my body tells me in no uncertain terms that I need to eat.  

That sort of focus can be obtained by other ways.  By reading a good book, by exercise, by talking to other people, etc.  

If you are feeling those feelings, then your response should be to jump into an activity which causes your brain to be more active.  It may be hard at first, but eventually, you start to develop discipline about it.

Remember, you probably don't even need three meals a day, let alone that and candy.  So, there's nothing other than your brain chemistry trying to get a hit of endorphins from eating food, and you can get that other ways.

As for your parents and the candy in the house.  Definitely ask them to cut down on it.  I doubt that even they need all of it.  But in theory, the only real changes they should probably absolutely have to make are preventing it from being close at hand outside the kitchen.  Leaving out candy bowls and such is common, but really should only come out if you have guests.  Otherwise, lock that stuff up and don't even go looking for it.

Your first goal is to find a list of things you can do around the house that you can jump on if you start feeling restless.  It can be entertainment, but having a chore list full of small chores can help you take your mind off it, while at the same time, getting something done and feeling achievement from those things."

I don't think you understand the pro-life position if you're suggesting that.

This isn't about saving as many lives as possible as some sort of numbers game.  Being pro-life is rejecting excuses for the unacceptable act of ending a life for any reason other than what is effectively self-defense.  

Unless you're suggesting that this will end all abortions, and we both know it will not, then we get to have an opinion about it's effectiveness and cost without compromising our position.   

Having said that, I'm not against such programs myself necessarily, but I am against portraying this as some sort of having to accept this solution or being hypocritical.  I can think of all sorts of awful solutions for this problem, and just because it might move towards zero doesn't mean that I have to accept any and all means by which to get there.

If that was the case, then my failure to vote for Trump was also not pro-life either and I am certain you don't want me starting to think that way.  Like it or not, making abortion illegal will end more abortions more immediately than longer term education methods simply by dint of ending ease of access.

In short, you can offer them knowledge and the means to use that knowledge, but that doesn't mean they will choose to do so.  

Of course, I would be happy to even cut down the number by 2%, but is that going to be as effective as we'd like it to be?  Especially if we keep assuring people that they can't possibly do anything wrong or make any bad choices in regard to if and when they have intercourse."

While I am not against allowing or even furnishing birth control (in some instances), the abortion angle isn't the only one when it comes to that.

Ultimately, its the same question about spending money on preventing stealing.  Yes, we could simply give everyone anything they would ever want when they asked for it, and that may well reduce stealing, but that might be completely infeasible economically.  

And it might not even end all stealing.  While most people steal because they feel they need to get money somehow, there is a small subset of people who do it for less understandable reasons, such as for thrills.  I'm not saying this is super common, but there may be enough of it that you still have that 1% who steals even if they don't need to.

It's important that things that we need to be protected from remain illegal, even if we're able to reduce them through other means.

More to the point, we're allowed to have multiple objections to a particular program or solution.  There are a lot of ways of ending abortions, some are going to be better than others, and that is a debate that can't be shut down just because a solution might happen to help on the pro-life axis a bit."

Having said that, we need to understand that some groups don't just view sex ed or contraception as being completely divorced from abortion.  There is a sense that the mindset that suggests abortion is a-ok is the same that suggests that we should have the right to view sex as purely entertainment and any reproductive results should be eliminated.

I certainly believe that birth control is 10,000x better than killing a living human being, and I personally believe that the State should leave birth control up to couples and only regulate it for safety and accurate statements of effectiveness.  That does not mean I always believe it is the right action to take, but since no one is actually dying, I believe that we can leave that decision to couples and to less coercive means of persuasion than the law.

I also believe that facts-based sexual education is important and entirely worthwhile.  Keeping people in the dark about their own reproductive system is a bad idea if you want healthy people of any age.

news,fetj061,t1_fesysqc,1579375939.0,"Actually, I'd say the rate of abuse is probably close to that of priests and other clergy.

Priest misconduct is particularly egregious because of their roles in the community as well as the contradiction of moral positions and the hierarchy's attempts to cover them up and move them around, but the actual incidence of abuse by priests isn't really much higher than in the general population.  

I think the way the priest abuse was handled and reported on distorts the numbers to make it seem like the rate was somehow higher.  It's not.

Abortiondebate,fetbkgb,t1_feskqxa,1579373645.0,"I think you're entirely misinterpreting what it means that pro-lifers don't ""care"" about sperm and egg.

The pro-life position is that a fertilized egg and every form it takes as a living individual human organism thereafter means that it has the right to life because it is a human being and therefore the subject of human rights.

Human rights are rights that every human has by default.  

A fertilized egg is a human being, albeit a small one at an early developmental stage.

Therefore a fertilized egg has the right to life.

A sperm or egg cell is not an individual human.  It cannot develop into an individual human being if left alone to live its limited existence without participating in conception.

Therefore, sperm and egg are not the subjects of the abortion debate, as they are not human beings, and therefore do not have human rights.  Human rights can only be assigned to individual human organisms, we do not argue, and I would not want to argue that treating them like a skin cell is unwarranted.  

You have the right to prevent your sperm or eggs from acting in a manner which you do not desire.  Indeed, insofar as you are able, you are probably ethically and morally compelled to be responsible with them.

But once they merge and form a new individual, your rights and responsibility for your sperm or egg ceases because your sperm cell or unfertilized egg cell have actually ceased to exist as what they were.  They are no longer ""you"" they are ""someone else"".  This is how human reproduction works.

history,festbcz,t1_feqkgn3,1579368832.0,"First off, this is a Soviet textbook, not a modern Russian one.

Under the Soviet Union there was an acknowledgement that things would be seen in a Marxist and Revolutionary manner.  The word ""acknowledgement"" being an understated way of saying: at some points under that regime, failure to do so would mean loss of jobs, academic credentials and sometimes, criminal prosecution or execution.

As for the West, there's no suggestion that ""the West"" is superior.  Nazi Germany was part of the ""Western World"" and did the same thing.  

The difference here is between objective history and history told using the Marxist theory of history uncritically.

There's nothing inherently ""wrong"" about the Marxist theory of history, but like any theory, you should view it objectively to determine if it is, in fact, useful.  

In this case, the government simply promoted this theory and insisted it be used to explain history, even coloring early materials so that the theory was considered ""proven"" even from the youngest ages and in the most basic courses.

The difference between that and what you called ""Western"" is that the more objective historical studies regard Marxist theory as a valid contender (and there are *lots* of Marxist historians), but just one of many which a historian might use to analyze historical trends and events.  That's why simply writing basic history with Marxist interpretation is considered a bad thing.  You should come to Marxism through analysis of data, and then apply it to facts to generate a theory you can defend.  

This isn't an East vs. West battle, its a battle between a set dominant political and social theory which refuses to accept competition as opposed to allowing the public and academics to come to their own conclusions.  I'd argue that short of overwhelming proof of Marxism being the only useful theory of history, remaining objective is absolutely necessary in academia and even in basic history classes."

aurora,feks15w,t1_feiul7r,1579206409.0,">So, how can I figure out if ships are good at their tasks? 

Determining if a ship is *good* is hard.  Determining if it will be minimally effective is much more attainable in a game like this were you don't get full information on enemy warship capabilities.

For a warship, high speed, and the longest range you can get for your main weapons where they are still effective is what I'd call minimally effective.  

One (very rough) thing you can often use to gauge an unknown enemy's capabilities is their speed.  If your enemy is considerably faster than your ships, your designs are not going to be effective or they simply outclass you in tech.

If the enemy clearly has a speed for their warships which your current designs can't easily match, go into the design screen and design a ship that can hit or exceed that speed while carrying one beam or one missile launcher (whatever your primary weapon type is) and the necessary sensors and fire control to use it to its maximum range.

You now have a minimally effective ship.  If you can't generate that speed even with that minimally effective ship, you're unlikely to be able to engage the enemy effectively with anything other than fighters or missiles.  And even if you have missiles, your lower speed means that unless you kill them, they will likely be able to pursue you, overtake you, and destroy you before you can escape.

*Comparative warship speed is your best general purpose indicator of effectiveness in this game.*  This is because you can close the distance faster, escape more easily, and/or evade attacks better.  

Missile speed is also of paramount importance as well, if you're using them.

>fewer ships with more weapons, or more ships with less weapons

You want the biggest ships you can justify.  

At the beginning of the game and for sometime thereafter, you only have one star system.  Chances are high that you will not even meet an alien until you go find them.  Even if you do, they will likely come from one place.  

In that case, you will probably need your military ships only when that happens and only in one place.  That means you don't have to worry about splitting your forces to cover ground.  You can have fewer ships, and if you have few ships they should always be as big as your shipyard capacity can replace in a reasonable amount of time.  

Look, if you only have one system and are rarely attacked, maybe you can get away with only one big, fast, super dreadnought that outclasses anything 1v1 or even 2v1 the enemy throws at it. The ship will get a lot of action, probably be able to tank better, and be a lot easier to manage.

But if you build too big and you lose that one ship, it may take you a year or more to build a new one and you may have only one slip that can build a military ship of that tonnage.  And in the meantime, you have no fleet.  

You will also have no fleet while that one ship is in refit.  

If you build too small, you never have to worry about having no ships, but you will have to spend more resources to gain the same amount of firepower as you would have with the one big ship.  If you don't need coverage or mix and match adaptability, then smaller ships are not your goal.  

Honestly, the answer to your question isn't based on how powerful the ships are, it's usually a matter of logistics.  Bigger is always better if your logistics are easy and distances are small.  Once you need to spread out and have more missions, smaller ships that are ""just good enough"" will start looking more desirable."

aurora,feid36j,t3_ep3fzs,1579135688.0,"Generally, you want to bear a few key points in mind.  Big ships will provide your biggest and most efficient punch.  These are generally referred to as ""capital ships"".  They can be carriers, which launch fighters at long range, or they can be heavily armored and beam armed battleships.  

Escorts are smaller ships that are there to provide what your capital ships lack.  Is your capital ship beam heavy, but facing an enemy with missile spam?  Design, build and attach specialized anti-missile escorts which use area defensive fire to kill missiles heading for your battleship.  

Are you facing heavily armored beam ships?  Add beam escorts with heavy armor, high speed and let them try and tank damage instead of your expensive to-repair battleship.  

Or perhaps add escorts with their own missile spam to put some holes in the enemy's armor before they can even get in range. 

Small escort sized ships can be built faster, take up less shipyard space as they are built, and you can retool those shipyards to build upgraded models of those smaller ships with newer tech and/or different components much faster.  

All of that begs the question... why would you want big capital ships over just a spam of smaller ships?  

A few reasons.  First, you can fit bigger installations on bigger ships.  Component capabilities (range of sensors, power of beam weapons, range of beam weapons, etc.) is usually directly related to the size/volume of the component.  While 1000 fighters is probably a considerable amount of fire power, they will never be able to fit a sensor suite that can cover an entire system from where they are, nor can they fit weapons that can hit as hard and from as long a range as a single shot from a spinal mount weapon.  

Second, small ships use volume less efficiently.  Every ship still needs officers, engines, engineering space, accommodations, fuel space etc.  While capital ship engines are many times larger than fighter engines for the same speed, they can push a lot more volume, which means that there is extra volume for accommodations, fuel bunkers, engineering spaces, etc.  This makes those ships able to have higher endurance and more space for weaponry and sensors per unit of engine.

A large ship is also much less likely to be completely destroyed in battle in comparison to smaller ships.  This means that you can put critical systems on that ship and they will be relatively safe.  Your battle group's high skill Admiral is not going to find himself in a pod or dead from a few stray hits.  

Finally, you want a supply train.  You at least need tankers, and if you have missiles, you will want a magazine ship to carry reloads without trekking all the way back to a base.  It is also a good idea to have a ship with maintenance supplies, especially if you have to deploy during wartime and can't take time to rotate the ships out for refits as much as you'd like.

As others have said, these ships should remain behind your main fleet in secure systems.  They're generally civilian type ships completely unarmed save for maybe a CIWS.  Making them military ships makes them much more expensive for no real value (although I think if you have magazines, your ship counts as military even without weapons or mil engines).    

These supply ships are just mobile gas cans/general stores.   They extend the range and operating time of your fleet away from base and you will need a supply train if you want to have any hope of prosecuting wars well away from your core systems.  While you can simply draft existing tankers and freighters *ad hoc* to support a particular deployment, I usually find it to be a better idea to create dedicated fleet supply ships.  For one thing, most tankers and freighters aren't going to need jump drives.  For my supply train, I usually add a jump ship so my supply train can follow the fleet without the fleet needing to turn around and jump the supply ships in after securing a system.

One thing to remember is that you should never, never patrol with capital ships in peacetime.  They're too expensive.  Keep them at your bases that have enough maintenance capacity for their tonnage.  Otherwise you will need to have them in refits constantly.  And capital ship refits take forever.  In fact, you should probably put them in PDC hangars when not in use, as that freezes maintenance costs.  Not sure if that is still a thing or it has been patched out, but you can build PDC hangars and even motherships that have enough hangar space for huge battleships.  Build them and use them and you'll be able to have save a lot on dealing with refits and maintenance supplies.

You may also want to design dedicated high endurance patrol ships for peacetime jump point camps and as forward deployed first responders on the frontier.  You never know when an explorer ship is going to get fragged by an alien you didn't know about and need a military ship close by which can do a rescue.  You don't want to have to activate your battle fleets for any of this if you can help it."

He was not the only person responsible for WWI, but he was certainly a top influencer in that direction.  He was under no obligation to deliver the blank cheque to Austria and it was hardly in Germany's interests for him to get into a World War.

Like his contemporaries he wanted a war to justify the war machine he'd built and gain glory for himself and Germany.

""Am I really going to achieve my goals this way?  Do I see an end in sight for the resources that I may have to add in addition to what I already allocated?""

That point needs to be before you have invested so much that you are personally unable to cope with the losses that you have accumulated even if you stopped at that very moment.

It's true that few plans work out exactly as you would expect, but it is important to ask yourself whether you really need just a little bit more, or whether what you are doing is just shovelling time, resources, and emotional investment into a black hole that will happily suck everything you want to throw at it, and still have little to show for it.

Sometimes, you learn enough to realize that you were going at it wrong and correct that, but frequently, you should probably consider stopping, recovering and reassessing.  

For a goal that could have a lot of hard work with little immediate reward or feedback, it is critical to know what you wanted to get out of the project, because that may well set the cut off.  If you're doing it because you always thought being a CEO will make you happy, that might be a different point than, ""I love a challenge and will derive satisfaction from taking this long-shot to success"".  

Even if you know it is a long shot going in, it is super important to know where you are at set intervals and how the experience compares with where you want to be, and how it compares with realistic expectations.  For instance, a gambler who is willing to spend a lot of money on poker in return for the thrill of one big win might realize that they will spend a lot of money, but they may not have realized just how strong the competition is, or they may have overestimated their skill level.  If that is the case, they should get out because even though they are willing and able to spend a lot of money, they're never going to achieve their goal."

AskMenOver30,fdo01r8,t3_ely0e7,1578596328.0,"The ""sunk cost fallacy"" is sort of a bad way of putting it.

You should go into a project with enough energy and resources to do a good and complete job of it and then see that project through to the end of your plan.  Many situations in life look bad or pointless until you hit a certain point and then you succeed from there.  You will only reach the point of success if you put in the time and effort.

However, if you have exceeded reasonable expectations for what you need or what you can afford to expend on a particular project, then this is where you have to cut the cable, so to speak, or your efforts become an anchor that prevents you from moving on, and may even drag you down.

It's sort of like gambling.  If you say, ""I will wager no more than $100 and that will entertain me,"" then even if you lost all that money and made your winnings, you have completed that project and now you can (and should) move on. 

For something like a CEO job, it is possible your acquaintance is never going to succeed.  They may just not have what it takes to be successful.  

On the other hand, there's no set roadmap to being a CEO.  Some people have to learn from hard mistakes to become good at a job.

The question to ask is not why they keep doing it if they are bad at it, the question to ask is whether they had set goals and expectations from their project and whether they have set a point where they have to assess if their project is meeting their expectations and then end it."

More to the point, who determines worth?  To my mind, it is yourself.  If you look at people who state that they are happy, they are never happy for the same reason, which implies that there are multiple yardsticks for actual happiness out there that are valid.

Although it sounds trite, rich people are frequently not happy, people who are able to have sex a lot aren't always happy.  Guys who have their own TV shows where they are paid to travel around the world and do interesting things sometimes kill themselves.

Yes, I think you need a comfortable amount of money, of relationships and some reasonable goals and ambition to probably feel good, but that leaves a lot of room for you to set your goals within your own limitations.  

To my mind, no one is worthless, or everyone is worthless because you can find both worth and uselessness in everyone you look at, if you're inclined to do so.  

That's why I think therapy might be of value here.  It isn't an easy thing to change your perspective, and you may need help to do so if there are chemical imbalances affecting your ability to do so.  You don't have to be stark raving crazy to suffer from what I'd call ""quiet depression"".

And let's be clear.  While it is probably true that 7-ish billion people don't know you or care about you, their lack of caring is simply that they don't know you and have other things on their mind.

How *is* that arrogance?  People are permitted to believe things.  You believe you are right and I am wrong.  Does that make you arrogant?  

>You believe you are right above everyone else that believes differently on the planet. 

I happen to belong to a religion with a billion adherents, and probably at least half that number believe something very similarly, but differ from me based on some doctrinal issues.  That's hardly me against the world.

As far as people who believe other religions or no religion at all, they believe they are right too.  I don't think this is an issue of arrogance.  How and why we exist, as well as any proposed afterlife are important considerations.  At some point, you have to take a faith you believe in and go with it.  I don't pretend to have all the answers, only that I have chosen a particular path and having done so, intend to follow it.  

>Don't try and make Christianity out to be some innocent ideology lol.

I am not even sure what you mean in relation to what I said.  I was only pointing out that if one believes there is a God, it is a rational course of action to follow the instructions of that entity.  

>It also inhibits, limits, and divides. Religion is not solely a driving force for good. It contributes to an equal amount of bad.

Religion does divide people.  Christ himself said it would do so in the gospel.  But the reason for that division is that following the path we believe to be the best one is not going to agree with everyone.  That's simply unavoidable.

The reality is that I follow a faith that I believe is the best course.  I don't pretend that it lays all the answers to every question in front of me.  

As I have alluded to, there are certainly those out there who act very certain all of the time about how right they are that God wants them to do X and Y.  And yes, those people may well be arrogant.  I do think there are things it is clear that God wants us to do, because those things are repeatedly emphasized in the teachings we have received, but probably more than half of those are simply forgiveness and general altruism, hardly the actions of arrogance."
