dogs,ff4f71c,t3_erjxzg,1579562161.0,Dawn dish soap  is very effective at killing fleas. They use it on ducks after oil spills and my dog with sensitive skin has never had a bad reaction.  Just use a good conditioner afterwards.
AskVet,ff2qaay,t1_ff2ncua,1579519110.0,"His technique involves threading the artificial ligament through the  knee joint and then around the outside. I might be using the wrong terminology, sorry about that.

My dog did see an actual surgeon but she wanted to do TPLO and she didn't make the bone cutting concept any easier to digest. I appreciate your input and will look into things further."
AskVet,ff2n4pp,t1_ff2kvaj,1579514295.0,He is performing what he described as a intra + extracapsular technique and he only does this for smaller dogs. I understand that many have had great results with TPLO but I am very troubled by the concept of breaking a bone to repair a ligament.
AskVet,ff2kkqe,t1_ff1td0p,1579510431.0,Does the inflammation subside?
AskVet,ff2kj32,t1_ff1x99u,1579510367.0,"I went to this vet based on the recommendation of a coworker whose dog also tore their CCL. After reading your comment I looked him up and I see no mention of him being a certified veterinary  surgeon, just a DVM. Who decides when a board certified surgeon is needed as opposed to a DVM?"
dogs,fe6mt5m,t3_en16fk,1578896310.0,"Just saw your update. I've been told it is difficult to visualize a CCL/ACL tear in x-rays. Did the vet perform a drawer test? 

My dog was also trembling, walking with his tail between his legs but he wasn't dozing off. Are we sure he's not having some type of seizure?"
dogs,fe6mkit,t1_fdvkfrg,1578896044.0,"I can't figure out how to upload a video to imgur like you did. When I search for the file it only shows jpeg files... Anyways, one vet said we could try conservative treatment which is a pain killer, anti-inflammatory and restricted use of his leg. He is 30lbs and right at the limit of what the vet considered to be eligible for conservative treatment. The other option 
was bone cutting surgery called TPLO. We also saw an orthopedic specialist and she recommended surgery. She's the surgeon who would be performing it. 

We went with the conservative treatment and he's doing much better but not 100% yet. Conservative and surgery both have a  3-6 month recovery period."
dogs,fdttbcf,t1_fdtflrm,1578721869.0,"Just grab an old t shirt and cut a strip of fabric long enough to go under his belly and up to your arms reach. Other options could be a non-leather belt, a scarf, a reusable shopping bag (link to Google image search result-  [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/b5/2f/43b52fa7b621c11a997d663be503273e.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/b5/2f/43b52fa7b621c11a997d663be503273e.jpg) )"
dogs,fdts9n0,t3_en16fk,1578721406.0,"My dog went through a similar episode. At the time it was raining and he hates going potty on wet grass so the vet thought he must have been backed up and having stomach cramps. The vet gave him some fluids and sent us home after he seemed to be back to normal. Several months later he randomly started limping and the vet determined he tore his CCL (ACL equivalent). Thinking back, I now believe that first episode could have been the initial partial tearing of his CCL. I have a video and will post a link to it as soon as I figure out how..."
dogs,fdtqikp,t3_en077r,1578720631.0,"In addition to exposure, your dog might struggle to make out the facial features of a dark skinned person. So not only is this person unfamiliar to your dog, he isn't able to get a sense of what this person is up to and whether or not they pose a threat."

WorkersComp,fdoseui,t1_fdmjaa4,1578611833.0,"Based on labor code 4453, I'm thinking that 2/3 of his average hours worked at his second job should be paid to him at the hourly rate of his city job?"
WorkersComp,fdorshi,t1_fdn1105,1578611447.0,It is my understanding that the weekly cap is not an issue. The issue is that the injury occurred at the lower paying of his 2 jobs. 2/3 pay from his second job is higher than 100% pay from the job he was injured on. The claims adjuster said the system won't accept that type of scenario.
WorkersComp,fdor7mu,t1_fdn1105,1578611078.0,If he's already had surgery covered by workers comp he's still able to get a lawyer?
WorkersComp,fdor2ol,t1_fdmjaa4,1578610990.0,"Yes he's missing time from both jobs. 

He was told he would get full pay from the city due to their injured employee policy but he hasn't received any payments yet. 

They said to forgo payment so that he can make a lost wages claim as part of the settlement once they determine his permanent disability percentage. It was a bad break and I guess they are assuming there will be some degree of permanent disability once his physical therapy runs out. 

It seems like he'd just be better off finding a lawyer. Can he still do that if workers comp has already paid for medical care?"

dogs,fdd2611,t3_ekho57,1578291795.0,"My dog  had a slab fracture of his upper 4th premolar.  Two different vets refused to pull it and referred me to a  dental specialist. The specialist wanted to do a root canal so we went that route. Within a year the crown fell off and replacing it required another round of anesthesia. Now I feel like it's a constant concern and I wish I tried harder to find someone willing to just pull the darn thing.

edit- I should have mentioned that this wasn't considered a simple extraction. The tooth itself was considered healthy and the roots were within the jaw bone."
LosAngeles,fckkyec,t3_ehnyt9,1577727593.0,Where did you and your pups go? Off the 2?
dogs,fbxujbu,t3_eevwsl,1577200878.0,... but what happened to him? His leg gave out on him and then what? All of this started one month ago? Sorry for your loss and I'm sorry to pry but my dog just turned 9 too and I'm terrified of what's in store for us in terms of his health.
