relationship_advice,ffufdq1,t1_ffudms8,1580240795.0,"Dude...I'm all for supportive husbands and fathers and all, but have you, uh, considered that being supportive might not mean ""being in the room""? It might mean ""go the fuck away and let me deal with this primal, painful, uncomfortable experience in a way that's most  comfortable for me""? Like I get that you're hung up on *why* OP didn't want her husband in the room, but it doesn't actually matter - what mattered was what was comfortable for mom and baby. 

To put it another way, if she didn't want her husband in there because, say, he's squeamish with blood and she didn't want to deal with him barfing everywhere, would you say that's a good enough reason for him to wait outside? Or are there just no good enough reasons? What does that say about your priorities?

Edit: to be clear, I'm only responding to this response and not to OP. It sounds to me like OP blindsided her husband and that there might be a lot more issues that haven't been mentioned. Her husband has a right to feel betrayed and angry, I'm merely pointing out that giving birth is a tense and emotional thing and sometimes the answer to ""how do I be supportive"" is not ""be there""."
offmychest,ffsyupi,t1_ffswzs9,1580198306.0,"Eh, I used to work rescue. You don't do it because you're being practical, you do it because you want each and every pet to have a chance at a good life. It's a moral grey area and while I agree with the spirit of it, the reality is ugly and when it comes down to it, I'd rather see a greater number of dogs in happy homes than a smaller number of 'more deserving' dogs.

It's hard enough already to get people to adopt a perfectly healthy dog with a good temperament, much less a dog with serious health or behavioral issues. The rescue I worked with would inevitably adopt out all their cute small dogs within days and be left with big energetic dogs - tack on a prey drive or dog aggression or heartworms and you could guarantee that we would be stuck with that dog for at least a year, and those are all minor ""flaws."" Our adoption fees were at a cost to us, and it eventually became our policy to screen for any major issues because we couldn't afford to deal with them."
AskReddit,ffia3zl,t3_etohsu,1579968958.0,"Everyone's mentioned other medical issues, so here's my pet peeve:

The Good Guy area for wounds, usually gunshota. For some reason, movies believe that your shoulder is just an extraneous space with a few muscles and bones in it. No major vessels, no organs, no nerves...so when the Good Guy gets shot in the shoulder, he's in pain but we all know he'll be fine.

Realistically? There is a massive amount of important stuff there. Your subclavian artery, for one, which would make you bleed out in seconds if a bullet hit it. The top of your lungs. The brachial plexus (all the nerves that control your arm + part of your side and back). Not to mention the dozens of smaller vessels, nerves, etc - if you were shot in the shoulder, you could easily die or permanently lose use of your arm. It's arguably less damaging to get hit in the gut or in an extremity, depending on the weapon."
AskWomen,ff91qjx,t1_ff8gy0d,1579702672.0,I'm really sorry to hear that. One of the things that pushed me to separating from my ex was him admitting that he'd consider being with a man (prior to this he was certain he was straight) if it meant having someone who would engage in his fetish. It sucked feeling like I wasn't special to him - that I came second to his fetish.

AskWomen,ff7qr56,t1_ff7n1lr,1579656071.0,"I actually asked him how he realized that he had this fetish during the time I was trying to be supportive. He said that he'd always been drawn to things like that, even when he was very young. It certainly ruined the Rugrats for me, let me tell you. 

And no, not really? I was never one to snoop, nor did he give me reason to. He seemed like a pretty normal nerdy guy.

Edit to clarify: FWIW, his fetish did not center around children. He wanted to be the child, not put his penis in a child, if that makes sense? Not really more comfortable for me, persay, but I didn't feel the need to report him to anyone."
AskWomen,ff7c7oq,t3_ery0pp,1579646149.0,"This is a seriously specific question that I have a seriously specific answer to!

I started dating my ex-husband when I was 15 and he was 17. We got along well enough and we were both pretty tame people, so when I went to college 100 miles away it wasn't a big deal. I would drive home most weekends and he would occasionally drive up (logistically it worked out better) and we talked on the phone each and every day. Four years of LDR before I moved back home and started applying to medical schools, and then, at the age of 23 and 25, we got married. 

It just made sense - we had been dating for 8ish years already. We'd talked about the future and there were no massive red flags - we agreed on being childfree, on focusing on careers, on just being each other's friend and support through life. We were about to move in together. Things looked like they were coming together.

And then about two years into the marriage, during a time when we were trying to rekindle some of the excitement, it came out that he had an adult diaper fetish. 

I tried very hard to be supportive of him because he was my best friend and the man I had thought I would spend my life with. I encouraged him to explore this new aspect of himself...and it was really just the first crack in the resentment dam. He spent more and more time talking to other people who shared his fetish. He stopped being interested in intimacy with me because he wanted very different things in regards to sex (to his credit, he never pushed me). And then one day I looked at my relationship and my life and realized that the last thing holding us together was gone - he never took initiative unless it was for something fun for himself, he had to be nagged about chores, he wasn't thoughtful towards me, and now...now I knew for a fact he didn't even really desire me as a partner. I had put so much effort into supporting him in his endeavors, calming his anxiety, cheering him on when he felt depressed...and he was willing to abandon me for a literal wet diaper.

We separated a few months after he had come out about his fetish, but I felt obliged to keep his secret and give him time to get his life in order, so we remained married for some time after that.

I probably would have eventually left him anyway, if I'm honest. He was very sweet and kind, but he put zero effort into the home. He mostly just sat around and played video games while my parents supported us and I worked my butt off trying to become a doctor. I did most of the cooking and cleaning despite the fact he stayed home all day, and it was really just a matter of time before things blew up.

I've since remarried to a lovely, wonderful man who makes a point to help out with the home, who runs our joint business (since I'm finishing up medical school), and who goes out of his way to be loving and affectionate. I'm not in contact with my ex, but I hear he's doing well. I wish him all the best, to be honest, but I'm so much happier now with my current husband than I ever was with my ex.

Edit: Good lord, ya'll. Thank you for the awards??? I hope each and every one of you has a good day."

relationships,feko1kn,t1_fek20p4,1579204052.0,"It's possible that the prescriber worded it in a particular way, ie, ""these medications will help with the symptoms causing your anxiety, such as the voices you've been hearing,"" and your sister interpreted it to mean that her medications are for anxiety. I've absolutely seen doctors explain medications in that way - not because they're trying to lie to the patient, mind you, but because the patient often comes in for a specific reason and are more likely to take their medications if they think it will help their issue.

science,fehkcu8,t1_fehh5y9,1579118311.0,"While I feel that as a society we absolutely fail at letting people go when it's time, this is heavily ignoring the massive spectrum of people who get cancer. The most common cancers are things like breast, prostate, and colon - and these are, thanks to early screening, also the most survivable. People diagnosed with one of those cancers can and do come out with only minor issues - but they still need months of expensive treatment. For example - mother of 2 who finds out she has breast cancer in her 40's may need surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy...all expensive, but euthanasia isn't appropriate in this case. Also, there's many cases where the patient has a percent chance of success - it's unreasonable to just go ""Well, Mr. Smith, you have a 50-50 shot at getting your colon cancer into remission. Let's talk about getting your affairs in order."" They'll want to take that chance...and rack up medical bills, whether or not they lose the coin flip and get worse.

End of life care (not just cancer, but things like severe congestive heart failure, decompensated COPD, etc) is expensive and can be inhumane. I'd be willing to push for encouraging patients a choice of euthanasia there...but not for cancer care, because too many patients are treatable and capable of continuing to live a meaningful life. Which...is hilariously the problem - people beating cancer and then having to deal with the bills."

funny,fegm0r2,t1_feg4e05,1579096870.0,"Well...that depends.

On that list most hound breeds are at the bottom (ie, beagles, Afghan hounds, etc), which is likely because we bred them to follow a prey animal, not listen to commands.

Otherwise it's really very much a question of how you define intelligence. Is a beagle who can unlock a door to get to treats, but can't seem to learn how to ""sit"", dumb? Idk.

Yes, you can be addicted to marijuana. It sounds like he's using it to escape from the reality of being a 19 year old with few prospects and no hope for the future. He's increased his usage. He's already stealing from you and is starting emotional manipulation tactics (The silent treatment all day? Seriously?) to pressure you into buying him marijuana. If you replace ""weed"" with ""beer"" and told us how he used to drink a beer with you occasionally but now he's drinking 3-4 beers daily, is stealing them from you, and begging you to buy a six pack for him, that would be massive alarm bells.

AskReddit,fed7e01,t1_fec5yay,1579002342.0,"Good lord. Okay, here's the point I was making: humans are a combo meal of genetics and experience. Even identical twins only have a 50/50 shot of developing schizophrenia (a highly genetic disorder) if one twin has already developed it. Gender is, arguably, dependent on the same combo. Since there's more to development than just a binary XX or XY (see: the extreme cases I previously listed), do you maybe think that there could also be subtle brain or hormone or idek, proteomic differences that push someone to identify as a different gender than the one they were born as?

Gender is a helluva thing, and no, not every person born develops as a male or a female ""barring extremely rare chromosomal defects."" I assume you're trying to make the case that chromosomes = gender here, so I'll bring up intersex individuals (where the chromosomes may be normal, but they're born with indeterminate organs), the Guevedoces who develop as girls until they hit puberty, and androgen insensitivity syndrome where genetic males literally never develop as males.
