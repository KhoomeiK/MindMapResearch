conspiracy,ffp8ys9,t1_ffp5d41,1580089159.0,I’m not disagreeing what was said above but this had an impact on me and I don’t worship Kobe.  He joined the NBA and became a household name just as I was graduating high school and he has continued to be in the news.  I have lost someone that was just on the periphery of my life.  I’m sorry he died but really I think the true sorrow comes because his deaths reminds me of my own mortality.  You never know when your gonna go.

nfl,fe9891t,t1_fe95y4c,1578935259.0,I missed the first half so I don’t know how the Packers got the points but in the 2nd they were stifled except for the TD drive.  Rodgers looked frustrated.  He just made a couple of phenomenal throws that allowed them to win it.  But the Hawks defense was dialed in 2nd half imo.
AskReddit,fe8xbll,t3_enu36l,1578932000.0,"So we were playing a card game at my buddies house and his cousin was there.  Not hot not hot at all.  Anyway we are all shitfaced and she comes over and sticks her tongue in my ear.  I was horny and said if you stick your tongue in my ear I will stick my dick in your pussy.  She said ok.  So I took her out on the sunroom and was hitting it on the couch .   This sunroom has sliding glass doors going into the house.  I could see my buddies laughing as I banged away on this girl.  Well we ended up screwing for hours and fell asleep in a bed a little later.  I woke up about 6 and looked over at her.  I was horrified.  I grabbed my clothes and got out of there as fast as I could.

To add to my shame my buddies mom found the rubbers in the trash can the next morning."

Well they cut through 15 to 20 conduits in the slab.  Killed all the power to the cash wraps.  Somehow the electricians were able to chisel out and expose the conduits and pull new wire befor the store opened.
