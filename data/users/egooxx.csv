loveafterporn,ffak5h4,t3_esh63k,1579737747.0,Yours was one of the first names I remember I kept in mind when I first came to this sub. I am so glad to hear that things are looking up for you. And I'm proud of you for making such progress and also of your boyfriend for finally committing. I wish you and your family all the best!
loveafterporn,ff7ipe4,t1_ff7i09k,1579650475.0,"Ikr... as if what he said wasn't bad enough... but the fact that he laughed makes it so incredible cruel... 

But what I find much more worrying is the fact that OP's husband chose to laugh with him. If me and my bf would sit there, my bf would say ""Why are you laughing? Her suffering is not funny"", and rightfully so. Just like any empathic person would."
loveafterporn,ff7ifx7,t1_ff7hdgg,1579650297.0,"If you feel like you wanna do that, definitely do it!! I like that spirit! :) Don't let this one man define your perception of therapists, don't give him that kind of power. He seems to be not worth it. Let him know what you felt and thought, tell him about that power imbalance he created when he created that ""2 men laugh at one woman""-situation. If he is a decent human being, it will make him think. If he's not - well, then you can at least be proud for standing up for yourself."

loveafterporn,ff733ht,t1_ff7227x,1579640152.0,"You write ""my wife's trauma"", so I assume you are a PA? Can you maybe share with us and OP what the both of you did for recocery instead of going to a couple's therapist?"
loveafterporn,ff6ghi6,t3_erwslb,1579626683.0,"Hi! 
I quickly checked your post history and first off want to say ""welcome"" to our little family since you seem to be new around :) 

You and me, we are in the very same boat in regard to the feelings towards our boyfriends and towards future / kids (and the fact that we're both overwatch players AND play support :D ). 

What I wondered while reading your post is... what do YOU think about having kids in regard to your own life, in regard to imagining yourself as a mother etc? You have told us about what worries you, how you're scared by being stuck with someone when it turns out things are going south ... and I totally get that, but if you leave all of that aside for a second, I dunno... imagine we could procreate without a partner... if there would be no one else and nothing else to consider but yourself... can you depict yourself as a mum? 

Because I think we need to answer that first before we then need to find out what kind of life we want in order to become a mum. And me personally, I have no idea. I really have no idea whether I wanna be a mother someday or not with all of the outside factors aside. I hope that I'll find that answer during my next two years of therapy. But maybe it's easier for you? 

If you answer this with ""yes"", you shouldn't worry too much about outside factors. It's just natural to imagine a happy family situation in which the baby is born and raised, but life never is predictable and people can cheat, lie but also die, love can vanish. If your partner had no problem with porn whatsoever, you could come up with plenty of other arguments for why it is scary to get a baby. I mean, there are so many husbands and boyfriend whom I read about where I'm sure no one should ever have kids with them, because really there are some terrible stories to be found, but if your boyfriend is what you describe him like (and therefore similar to mine), this is not quite the case here. Which is why I say you should rather try to find out whether you yourself can depict yourself as a mum or not. If you can you shouldn't hold back due to something that MIGHT happen. If you can't, I would wait it out a few more months and reevaluate. And just as a sidenote - I live in Germany and I see you're in Sweden, and in both of our countries the situation for single parents is much better than it seems to be the case in the US. I'm only adding this because I want to remind you that even if things happen, there's always a way and there's always SOME kind of support. 

What is for sure though is that you should not try to get pregnant because you're feel pressured into something or because you say ""screw it, I'll do it"" while still questioning that decision. In the end, nobody but you has a say in this. 

I don't know if that helped, just wanted to share my take on this. Please don't hesitate to share your thoughts if I didn't answer your question in a way that helped, because I'm very interested in discussing this topic too, but rn can't seem to find the right words."

loveafterporn,ff4q0fg,t1_ff3jbek,1579569667.0,"You probably know this already, but maybe you need to hear that though: you have absolutely no reason to feel ashamed, and you are not guilty for anything except for being a caring and loving mother who wants the best for her child! You are carrying a miracle right now, so despite all circumstances this is something to be proud of! And even if it feels like the opposit - you ARE surviving right now! And you will keep surviving, because you are so strong for coming here today and opening up to us and asking for help, so please try to have a little faith in yourself that you will know what to do when the time comes. Me, personally, I have that faith in you already."
1200isplenty,ff333ok,t1_ff1dlwr,1579532430.0,I'm quite baffled by how many seem to make dinner /meal prep for their bfs / husbands. Why not do it together?
loveafterporn,ff2vxap,t1_ff2vfcz,1579526195.0,"Great :) Happy for you! Sounds as if he's on the right way! 
You don't need to have an Iphone to do any of the things I mentioned, if that is what you mean, you can all do that in the parental control settings of his Iphone. 
I hope recovery will continue to work well for the both of you <3"
loveafterporn,ff2vavd,t3_erc0us,1579525547.0,"No, you are not. Accountability is a great idea and Iphone's parental control provides great options for that. I like it a lot. However, I would have asked him before doing it - in fact I did exactly that bc my bf has an Iphone too. But now that you have done it, I would just tell him that you did it and see how he reacts. If he's in real recovery, he's gonna be okay with it. Parental control provides the option to turn off Safari's private mode and to disable the deletion of browser history which means Safari can't be used for anything that you can't see. You can also either disable the installation of new apps without the code, or you can disable the deletion of downloaded apps, which imo is better because then he can still download any app he might need but can't delete it afterwards without you typing in the code. 

So in summary, no you are not in the wrong, although I think you should maybe inform him."
loveafterporn,ff22fbr,t1_femjcql,1579491970.0,"Unsupportive wife? Fuck that shit. You have done everything, way more than you needed to, way more than I personally could do. If anyone ever says that to you, smile and turn away. Or just tell them, tell them what you endured and how you tried to be supportive for so long and how it didn't change anything. You are strong for doing so, loving and respectful, and if anyone doesn't see that, they're an idiot. 

I'm happy that you have a counsellor and that you work on your BT. I wish you all the best for that. I wish I couldve spoken to someone like you back when I was 16 and already in the middle of a severe BT. It took me 10 years to finally seek help. Women like you are inspiring. 

And thank you! I am trying my very best so it's just great to hear that. You can't imagine how grateful I am for having the chance to somehow make a change. We all are!"
loveafterporn,ff21t0n,t1_ff21jei,1579491502.0,"Yes, I agree!"
loveafterporn,ff21ne0,t1_ff216e7,1579491385.0,"Just read one of your older posts on dysfunctionalfamilies and how you told a little more about your daily struggles. I now want to urge you even more to look into those trauma things and trauma therapy. Pls know that if you start to see a GOOD trauma therapist they will accept any boundary you have. Even if it took you a year to tell them about your family they would accept and show understanding and respect. You cannot move on like this forever, and you don't want to reach a point where it will be a lot harder to make that decision. Please take care of yourself."
loveafterporn,ff216e7,t3_er1pw8,1579491034.0,"I am sure you have heard of that man who's been in war, who's seen his allies die from bomb fire, who got injured himself and now is back at home trying to move on with his life. But he can't, not like before, because he keeps seeing those pictures that are burnt into his mind. He keeps hearing the noise, the screams, the explosions. He keeps smelling the burnt air and the blood and the smoke. He either gets aggressive to all people around him, or he tries to flee from those memories by drinking alcohol, or he hides in the basement and shuts down completely towards his family. This is because he is traumatized. Traumatized means that he has experienced something where his mind told him he was in danger but he couldn't do anything about it, and since he didn't find a way out, his brain is stuck in this ""DANGER! DANGER!""-mode. So he reacts by using one (or multiple) of the three survival insticts: he fights (people around him and himself), he flees (from those thoughts, by using alcohol or excessive work) or he freezes (shuts down). Problem is - it won't get better. Only trauma therapy can help him, because the brain needs a loooot of time to learn that he is not faced with an actual danger anymore. This is an extremely hard process, and it is not beatable ""just like that"". 

Now, it doesn't need war or a car accident to get traumatized. PTSD is a common disease that many people struggle with, may it be due to sexual assault, violence or similar experiences. With C-PTSD, things get even more complicated, and that is what you should educate yourself about. 

Because based on what you wrote, I am almost 100% sure that a lot of C-PTSD relevant topics might sound all too familiar to you. 

Most people who suffer from trauma - may it be a childhood trauma or betrayal trauma - never know about it until they accidently stumble upon PTSD or C-PTSD, and some don't even know then because they are already so used to their symptoms that they don't recognize them for what they are anymore (Hey, that's me!). 

Read through your text again. Your brain is so sure that you are in danger that it even forced you to go through those painful images again and again. Every few lines you went back to describing those scenes, and I know that inner pressure to get those incredibly painful thoughts out all too well. To me it seems as if your brain rn is screaming at you ""SEEEE!!! THERE ARE THE BOMBS!!! YOU ARE IN DANGER!!! I'LL SHOW THEM ONCE MORE SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THEM!!!""... 

It seems as if those pictures from porn that you have clearly seen yourself are the bombs and the dying allies. It seems as if the moans are the explosions, and as if the smell of blood is the degradation you seem to sense with every cell of your body (rightfully so). 

I don't know if you already believe it, but getting a severe trauma from seeing sexual images in betrayal context is possible. I'm the living proof for that. Many people suffer from that, but not all of them are traumatized. It sounds like you are. The way how you force yourself to keep seeing it over and over again makes me sure about that. It also sounds as if you have had some very hurtful (sexual?) experiences before, but that is now interpretation on my end. If so, please know that this increases the probability of what I say to a point where it's a safe call. 

So, the answer would be: you can't stop it. You just can't. He can't. Because if you are traumatized, you just like the man who survived war need to understand you are exactly that - a survivor - and that you can't and don't have to make it on your own. Please visit r/cptsd and read over there. Read the sidebar. Buy the book that is linked in the sidebar (CPTSD: From surviving to thriving from Pete Walker). It is only 8$ or sth and it has changed my life. It is the only reason why I am now diagnosed with trauma. Google betrayal trauma and read as much as you can. And once you have done all of that, decide if therapy might be a helpful tool for you. 

As for your relationship - your boyfriend equals the fireworks that the man hears on NYE. He himself, as a person, is a trigger for the trauma, which is probably why your brain is constantly in danger-mode in the first place. You can't stop that, and he can't either. The hypervigilance will probably stick around. I wouldn't say that about every user I talk to but from what you told I think that is the case. You have to make that decision for yourself, but at this point I think it would be cruel to force yourself to endure this pain all the time, and I think your brain is telling you the same by bringing up those memories over and over again. What is sure as hell is that you will not be able to heal in that environment.

I am sorry. So terribly sorry. I know you never asked for this. It is not fair. But whatever it is you have experienced - you've survived. You're alive! I'd say make the best of it. If you can't afford Pete Walker's book, google him, you can find lots of interesting stuff from the book on his website for free. I know right now it feels like you will never be free. And I know it's hard, but you have to believe that a life without any of these emotions is possible, because it IS. But it might need therapy for that and if it does, that's completely fine. If you find it hard to compare it to the war trauma, compare it to a broken leg. You have broken your leg and nothing from your boyfriend or from yourself will make this bone heal - you have to see a doctor and get help. Only if you do that you will be able to walk again, but the beautiful thing is - once you do it, it is sure that you will be able to walk again!

loveafterporn,fepfg1u,t1_fepegxd,1579319165.0,"I'd say we should all take a step back now and let it be for a sec. Foreverinfinate is doing a wonderful job at this sub, not only as a mod but as a user in general. I've also always enjoyed your comments and participation on the sub since the day I found my way here. And I'm great too :) I just wanted to tune in to show some empathy towards both sides because I understand them both and while discussions are great, I don't think that fights should escalate that much on a sub that mainly is for support. 

Or, since some people have told me I'm sometimes too nice (which I really am not in RL but okay): we should all calm the fuck down."
loveafterporn,fepdq78,t1_fepcgnu,1579317984.0,"But she did that back when she wasn't a mod too sooo... I see why you are pissed off, I also see why she is pissed off, I'm just pretty sure she would have mentioned the rules if she wasn't a mod too. And as I said, I don't think the discussion is constructive anyway. I see why you're worried about the kids because I would be too if it was someone I haven't talked to before since it's a very hard story. But I also see why she's hurt by being accused. I don't find your first comment offending, you've just shared what you felt after reading that, but I still think it wasn't worded well because I know that if I were OP, I would feel attacked too. I 100% agree with foreverinfinate that asking a question about the kids would be a much nicer way to express what you feel instead of saying ""I am worried about your kids because they are xyz""... keep in mind that people are very sensitive when it comes to their kids because most people DO want the best for them and whenever I discuss the effects of someone's marriage on the kids I try to word it extra carefully (which does include questions) to really emphasize that I don't mean to judge anyone but just want to help and understand."

Not saying that the discussion is exactly constructive because it sure as hell isn't, but calling a mod a status abuser when they don't even mention being a mod is unfair. I've seen that happen before, not on reddit but in a totally other context where I modded a game and was accused of ""using my mod status"" for whatever even though I ALWAYS tried my best to make fair decisions for everyone , there's literally nothing that a mod can do to defend themselves against such an accusation because once it's thrown out, everything that the accused mod says will be taken the wrong way. So I just wanna emphasize she didn't use her mod status at all."

I've met my bf and my friends via playing, just like my bf did with our now mutual friend years back in WoW. Things happen, and they can happen to anyone. Despite looks and (unfortunately) despite personality. If you were German I would ask you to play with us (though you would have to switch games since we're now maining Overwatch but I guess we can agree that Blizzard > Ubisoft) and see for yourself, that there are people who would love to integrate other socially akward people. But you're probably not German and my friends don't speak English unfortunately."
loveafterporn,felpyte,t1_fekeb08,1579228103.0,"Oh dude. I'm from IT as well and I just love all of your comments here. Not only because we share the same spirit in regard to porn, but because I love the way you look at things and how you make your point. You clearly are an intelligent person. And therefore a good example for why IT fails to realize that the whole ""pill""-movement (whichever pill it may be, all of them, also the purple ones) isn't just a bunch of weirdos, but a symptom of what is wrong with society in general. But we both know the world isn't just black or white. I am aware that many people on IT ignore the fact that there are many people, men and women, out there who suffer from loneliness so much that they don't see another choice but to become hopeless or cynical. Saying ""but looks don't matter, work on your personality"" cuts too short, well OBVIOUSLY it does and porn is just another proof for that. But saying that looks do matter most cuts too short, too. And I kinda feel like you wouldn't have developed that opinion if you had never heard of any pill or whatever. I've been on my own for a total of 4 years. I had nobody. Sat in my appt alone, never went out, didn't find anyone. Nobody was interested in being my friend or my partner. And I slowly lost interest in finding someone too. I became extremely cynical, and I am very happy I never found purple pill at the time because who knows what kind of ideas I would have developed. That's 3 years ago and my whole life has changed. That period of time didn't have anything to do with my looks nor with my personality, and the change that happened then didn't either. I'd suggest to get off the internet as much as you can (even though you did submit a great post to this sub, but you know your own life and hapiness is more important). I know there are a million (good) reasons for not going out there, and there are a million good reasons for becoming resentful, or for giving up. Don't do that though. Push through. There are way more like-minded people than you think. It just takes time to find them because of the law of probability. But it does happen. Believe in the math :)"
loveafterporn,felndjg,t1_felmttq,1579226319.0,"Definitely! It took me 8months of no porn to be able to have an orgasm  without a single porn memory in mind.

loveafterporn,feln7iw,t1_felmeto,1579226204.0,"But btw OP, I totally get your resentment, please don't get me wrong. It's just a shaming thing to say that you doubt his religious beliefs due to his addiction, and also that if he only wanted... Most PAs are so disconnected from themselves, they don't even realize what they want until it's too late. However I understand and feel your pain and frustration a 100% and since most PAs don't realize what they've gotten themselves into until they hit their lowest point, it's a good thing that you are going to see the lawyer. You have done everything you could - now the only thing you can and must do is to take care of yourself and make sure you're safe. Your safety should be your 1st priority. Since you have endured that several years now, it might be a good idea to see a therapist yourself - just to get a check-up and make sure you're okay. I don't want you to suppress pain that has gotten bigger and deeper during the years bc that's never a good idea."
loveafterporn,felmeto,t1_fel6374,1579225659.0,"This conversation is a good example for how the communication between PAs and partners should not be. It is a very right thing to say that addicts can't just stop, and that there are triggers than can cause relapses even during recovery, and it's also true that the only solution to this is an addict who wants to heal for themselves, not because of the partner. BUT since you ask for understanding for the addict's part I need to ask you for understanding the partner's side. Betrayal trauma, C-PTSD, anxiety, depression and hypervigilance are just as real as porn addiction and they can cost a partner their mental health to a point where they have no option left but to leave. Because it's never right to break only because mending someone else doesn't work. On the flipside, if every partner left their PA rn, porn addiction in general would get much worse and even more common. It is never a good approach to shame an addict by believing their just too weak, but it's just as bad to shame a partner for mental health issues they never asked for in the first place. I see a lot of subtle shame in this conversation and on both sides, and since you seem to be relatively new here, I think you need to work on your understanding for partners' potential mental health problems. It's not that we are just comparing ourselves, or that we're just insecure and need to hear a ""it's not because of you"". Me personally, I suffer from severe betrayal trauma due to being with 3 different ex PAs. A little positivity will never help someone traumatized like me, and more stricter rules will never help an addict to recover. The addict must do what they can do, and if they don't choose to see a therapist and to work on the addiction for the rest of their life, they won't start doing that for a partner. But a partner won't stop having betrayal trauma either. The last chance people have are the most open and emotional conversations possible, and if one or both don't want that or can't do that, it's the responsibility of both to accept that their shared path might be over."
loveafterporn,felksui,t3_epsxfh,1579224561.0,"It's something that most if not all experience in some sort of way, yes. However, the way it unfolds may differ for everyone. I like to think of porn opening up a second channel in the brain, next to the ""normal"" sexuality channel that includes fantasies of a real person and/or possible real life encounters. That 2nd channel is something entirely different to the sexuality channel and is kept alive by constant floods of endless pictures and videos that are burned into the long term memory. The more the addict relies on that channel for sexual purposes, the more powerful it gets and the less desirable becomes the ""normal channel"". Which is why I think porn is dangerous to consume for everyone. I've had a compulsive usage in the past myself and I can honestly and openly say that some of the moments I have seen in porn are way more burnt into my memory than real life sexual encounters I have had. It's not only because of the content, but also because of the unlimited supplies and of course the way our brain needs more to maintain a constant level of exictement. 
Sth I've seen in all of my 3 ex PAs is that they all closed their eyes during sex automatically and permanently - sth my boyfriend who is not a PA only does very rarely, during orgasm usually. It's a normal thing to do but I found it remarkable tho and experienced it myself, too."

loveafterporn,fekcro0,t3_eph4qa,1579197334.0,"Hey, opening up to a therapist who shows no understanding for the struggles we have can be extremely damaging. I experienced this a few years back. I knew from the beginning on my former therapist wouldn't be the right person to talk about it with, but during our work a DDay with my ex bf happened. Since I got suicidal I decided to open up about it, and her reaction was nothing but painful and caused me huge amounts of shame. Our work ended after a year and even though I had the opportunity to make it last longer I chose not to because I knew I would never be able to trust her again. We all wish for the same kind of understanding I guess, and if a therapist isn't educated in that whole thing their reaction might be hurtful but something you could at least work with - but when it's in a belittling manner... I can't imagine something more hurtful coming from a therapist. 

It took me years to find the strength to find a new therapist. I made sure to find someone who'd sound as good as possible on paper - in my case that was a psychoanalysist with trauma therapy experience. Waiting and searching paid off - I've seen her a few months now and things are working just fine. I waited to tackle the topic for several weeks - just to see what she's like first. She gave me a very open, trustworthy impression, so I decided to share bits and parts with her. She reacted EXTREMELY understanding, to a point where I wondered why I had been so scared all the time. She usually doesn't talk about her opinion, but I think she knew I needed to know her thoughts on this - just to be sure - , so she said ""well, but that's a very understandable emotion to have - I'd say it's normal to feel xyz!"" ... it was the first and the last time she used the word ""normal"" and I'm pretty sure she did so because of the huge amount of shame I carry around. 

So yeah, there's a possibility to get hurt, just like there is a possibility to get freed. Just like with every relationship. I had told her there was something very important I wanna tell her during the 1st appt already and instead of pushing, she asked me to elaborate that fear a little more. Until I finally opened up I dropped how scared I was of her reaction during every appt. I recommend to do the same. Don't force yourself. Wait, and then wait some more. Get to know her, see what your gut says over time. Tell her that there's something you wanna share but are too afraid to do and see how she reacts. Make her understand you are really scared, and at the same time try to evaluate whether there's a reason to be scared or whether she makes you feel safe. Don't push anything. Give yourself time."

The community has gotten younger and younger and while that means the quality of posts has decreased and the amount of superpower and bro science posts has increased, it also means it has become a place for wake-up calls for people as young as 14. So I don't go there often anymore but I am happy that teenagers have this place nevertheless. When I was 14/15, I could have needed such a place, in fact it would have saved me from 10 years filled with pain. It would have been much better to have the often shitty NoFap than to have nothing similar. I would've been able to filter out everything I wouldn't identify with and would've highly profited from the rest. Apart from that, it really doesn't matter how many people from pornfree flame about NoFap, doesn't change a thing about the fact that it's the flagship of the anti-porn movement and will continue to be for quite a while. Many people from pornfree have found pornfree and other places of support by finding NoFap first. I track numbers of all anti-porn subreddits I know of and NoFap is not only our biggest and most popular, but also the one with the highest increase of subs / day. Pornfree btw is the one with the lowest rate of increase, although I am still not sure why that is because I find it to be the sub with the highest quality posts."

loveafterporn,fdq5u3l,t3_emoim4,1578656177.0,"> when I discovered he relapsed hard. Over the passed couple months he has spent hundreds of dollars on cam websites and private Snapchat accounts.

This is NOT a relapse. This is an ongoing active addiction. Relapsing does not necessarily mean a single event, yes it is possible to relapse multiple times, but spending so much money for porn is not a relapse anymore but an addiction at its high point. It may have started with a relapse but evolved into the full-blown addicted behaviour. 

So my question would be... how exactly did he try to overcome it? What did he do for recovery during the past 4 years? 

You're already trying to get rid off or at least to minimize the pain you feel, even though he doesn't seem to be in real recovery. Our own healing of course always is important, but we need to know exactly what we're dealing with before we even get a chance to heal. If you keep calling this a relapse and just hoping that he'll somehow stop you won't be able to heal. You not only need a detailled recovery plan, but also full disclosure and some real effort on his end towards sobriety. 

If he isn't in therapy already, he needs to change that now, in fact yesterday. Since it has affected your marriage a great deal, I recommend not only him seeing a CSAT but you both starting couple therapy. Imo spending money - and then so much money - is a wake-up call that self-help is not enough and that the addict needs therapeutic help."
loveafterporn,fdq4qyw,t3_emopto,1578654781.0,"Two things struck me here.

First, your boyfriend shows a lot of disrespect and it's not only about the porn. Many people lie about their porn usage, which can be extremely damaging to a partner - it can turn the whole topic of porn into a basic issue of trust, to a point where it can leave the partner with a severe betrayal trauma that makes the partner question everything, I'm talking about every little thing that has ever been said and done within the relationship. It minimizes the partner's grip on reality so much that they start questioning themselves, their own perception and mind. So that alone can turn porn into something that affects basically every little aspect of the relationship. But this whole ""I don't know"" and ""I can't remember"" attitude... is (from my POV) even worse. Because it really is just another way of saying ""I think you're dumb, or I just don't even care enough to bring up ANYTHING, may it be a lie or an excuse or whatever"" ... it's so extremely disrespectful of your feelings or rather your person as a whole. You should really think about whether you want to tolerate being treated like a dumb person, because you don't sound like one and if he keeps treating you like this, he will never make any progress whatsoever.

Second thing ... you should continue by educating yourself on porn and its harmful effects on the consumer, the partner and the relationship. https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/ is a great place to get started. Also check out r/pornfree and especially r/pornfreewomen and see if some of the things you read there resonate with you. The reason I say this is because of the fact that you experience the damage porn can cause firsthand right now, but on the other hand you say you want to keep accepting porn as a part of your relationship (which it would be if you'd continue to use it). You say you want to relearn how to accept porn, but look at the damage it did to your trust and to your feeling of safety. You really don't sound as if you feel safe at all, because you are already in that hypervigilant state where you are so very aware of the things he has watched, the way you ""perform"" in the bedroom, the way you look etc ... Your sex life does not sound as if it is based on intimacy, love or anything like that, and I'm not saying that due to the kinks you mentioned or something, but about how you focus on your performance way too much. Ideally, sex should be a way to express passion and - as you said it yourself - fun. The sex you describe does not sound like fun at all. It sounds like stress, like competition, like perfect performance. For me personally it's pretty obvious how much you're influenced by porn and I assume that is not only your partner's porn usage but your own. I've been there. I have been with 3 different PAs and in order to cope I always used porn myself. It wasn't until I stopped completely that I was able to understand how extremely it affected and suppressed my own sexuality. In fact, I realized I was sexual for the first time in my life once I had stopped watching porn completely. My whole sexuality, every little thing changed. I still like it rough, I still like it a little crazy sometimes, still love to try new things, but the way I feel about myself and also my partner is a million miles away from where I had been before. I also struggled a lot with that performance issue that you seem to have. Sex only stopped being a stage where I tried to perform perfectly when I stopped the porn.

Apart from that, it is a double standard to say that you want to keep the porn in the relationship so that you can watch it yourself on the one hand but that you feel hurt by the porn usage of your partner on the other hand. And yes, you do feel hurt by that, it's crystal clear. The correct approach to getting rid off that double standard is NOT to accept porn and force yourself to somehow ignore that pain that is already deep inside you, but to get rid off the porn and try to relearn sexuality. Because that is what you're gonna have to do. Do not relearn to include porn, relearn sexuality from the get-go.

There's only one way for you to find out if I'm right, and that is if you commit to going pornfree yourself for some time. You've already gained enough experience of what it's like to keep porn in the relationship, and even if you think porn is not the problem I guarentee you it is. Your inner turmoil won't change. Now try the other way and see how it feels. I suggest you go pornfree for at least 90 days. You can still masturbate if you want to, but many people have found that going masturbation free was helpful in the process of getting to know their sexuality better. But that's your decision. If you want to continue masturbation, see what if feels like without using porn whatsoever for at least 90 days. That also includes fantasizing about porn. You'll find that this is incredibly hard to do, but the more you do it, the more you try to actively engage your own, personal fantasies, the more you'll find out about yourself and the more connected you'll feel to your own libido. And the less understanding you will have towards your partner's bullshit.

The other thing you have to decide is whether you wanna go on this journey with him or alone. I don't know, I would never be able to be with someone who disrespects me so much that he must think I'm stupid for accepting this ""I can't remember"" bullshit. Tbh, he sounds like a dull teenage boy. But maybe he's already so deep down in this pornified hell many can't get out of that he has no control over it anymore. Which would be a completely other issue then."

You should read the book that is featured in that sub a lot, Pete Walker's ""Complex PTSD - From Surviving to Thriving"". You already mentioned the word ""neglect"" yourself. You'll find perfect further thoughts on this in the very first chapter already. Based on what you wrote I am very sure you'll like it. And I disagree. It is very likely that you have experienced a traumatic event, or more correctly repetitive traumatic events, that have reinforced the trauma throughout your whole life to a point where it seems like a part of you (for example the sexuality related things, but probably more). Your brain has only learnt one way (in this case it's sexualizing girls, may that be yourself or other girl) and now only knows that one way to take. That won't change without trauma therapy. Many people with C-PTSD have no idea they are traumatized until they get educated on the subject. I never knew either, until some wise person recommended me the book above, just like I did now. I thought I'd give it a shot. I read it and it resonated so well, so much that I was in shock. Everything I had rationalized before now seemed to be so... different. I started therapy and my therapist has now recently confirmed my trauma. The book covers the different trauma responses we use a lot. After reading the 1st two chapters, you should read through those. There are good explanations of the 4 trauma responses and why so many traumatized people get misdiagnosed... simply because the trauma responses have much in common with the different personality disorders. Fight response often includes narcissistic traits and therefore is misdiagnosed with narcissism. Flight response often is misdiagnosed with obsessive or compulsive disorders. Freeze respnse often is diagnosed with antisocial (!) or dissociative disorders and last but not least there's frawn, which is often connected to codependency. Most traumatized persons have a main and a secondary response. What you describe does sound like a freeze-fight blend to me. Plus, I'd argue there is no way for a child to experience such neglect and abuse over a period of time without getting traumatized. So, the best advice you can get on reddit will be: read the book and see for yourself. Nothing to lose but a lot to gain. And look through the subreddit I've linked. Search for posts about childhood experiences that included violent videos and porn. Look for whatever you wonder might be connected to a possible trauma and see what those amazing people on the sub have discussed. See if it resonates with you."
loveafterporn,fdlxrai,t1_fdkpyvx,1578535025.0,Yes! The question of how we react when that happens simply is impossible to answer for most of us since most of us have only found out by snooping or on other ways. I can't count the days where I literally wished for one of my bfs coming clear about a relapse just once. Honesty really is a good indicator that he takes it seriously and commits to his recovery.

1200isplenty,fdkco8z,t3_elqy8v,1578501075.0,"Quäse! I fell in love with Quäse even though I don't like normal Harzer. Good source of protein and low in cals. A big plate with pepper slices topped with Quäse (whole package) is filling and (I think) not more than 200cals. Apple + Quäse is a perfect combination as well. 

Another one of my go-to's is Geflügel Wiener, I always buy the Mini Geflügel Wiener from Rewe's ""ja!"". 180g are 6 Wiener and no more than 300 cals. Combined with vegetables and salad it makes a great light dinner. 

Rewe Bio has a 250g package of Pumpernickel, each slice has 50g and is relatively low in calorie and with only good ingredients. The only bread I still eat. It's very filling because of the good carbs. I usually eat it with lox which is a perfect source of calories, and the Räucherlachs from ja! has so few calories that I tend to be skeptical if it's really true :D 

Rewe Bio has a freezed Reispfanne Curry-Hähnchen which is extremely tasty and low in cals as well, about 400 cals for a 450g package. Combine it wiiiith... 

Frosta! Frosta is my go-to for basically everything. It's a bit expensive, but basically all of their Gemüsepfannen are great and have the best ingredients possible. The Backofenfisch Kross is also less than 500cals and makes a perfect dinner when combined with veggies. 

I often use Schafskäse with 9% fat from Salakis which you can get everywhere. The whole package usually fits into my meal plans because it's low in calories. 

Zuivelhoeve has a great low fat Fla for the sweet tooth, however, even better are low calorie icecreams that probably are like the Halo Top Americans often share here.  You NEED to try Breyers Ice Cream, I already had Cookies and Cream as well as Salted Caramel and they only are about 300-400cals per 500ml tub!!!! Or Oppo, which is a bit easier to get. Try Oppo's Madagaskar Vanille or sth like that, it takes you straight to heaven :3 

I often replace bacon with ja's rohem Leichtschinken, very tasty and low in calories.

loveafterporn,fdk8ym3,t1_fdk8xnq,1578498779.0,"The thing that worries me the most is that after all of those terrible things he did and all of the warning sign your body and brain give you and that you ignore / try to get rid off, you're still saying you have a lot of compassion - but for him, not for yourself ... even if it should be for yourself, not for him, because YOU are the victim of abuse, not him. This is what reinforces my association with the ""frawn-type"". 

Okay, I could go on writing for ages now, but this has already been much to deal with. 

Ideally, you'd do the following: stop trying to get rid off anger, pain and mistrust. Don't regard them as ""simple warning signs"" and rather start seeing them as what should lead you to your next decision. Try to work on a support system that has nothing to do with him. If his family helps and supports you, that's great, but try to create a support system beyond that. If you have family members or friends you can trust, open up to them. If not, try to educate yourself about where you can get help in your area. Before you make any decision, take the most important step: find a therapist. If you say it's impossible, try to find a way regardless. I've read your other post from 4 months ago. I don't know if that was about yourself, but if it was, stop even trying to come up with reasons why it's not possible. I'm from Europe so I know shit about the insurance situation in the US, but if you have any questions in regard to how to get therapy without having much money, PM our main mod Hmack1 , she is a therapist and maybe knows a way ... or try to find posts about this very question on reddit, I am sure there are many practical advices. Especially if you don't have any support system, start to check in with us frequently, also see if you can find other subreddits that discuss mental health problems and abusive relationship situations. Once you have found a way to get therapy, work on the support system as well as your personal life goals. Therapy will cover this anyway, but your financial dependency on him must end in the long run. Therapy will help you understand who you are, who you want to be and how you'll get there, and this aspect is one of those that is essential for that. Even if you were now emotionally done with him, I understand that you might not be able to leave him forever by tomorrow. But the support system you have to build up is what will help you find a way for yourself.

One last thing I wanted to mention is your child. I've experienced childhood trauma myself and that started in a very dysfunctional family. I never got hit, never experienced physical or sexual abuse, but have childhood trauma nevertheless and the lack of love and affection between my parents played a big role in the dynamics that caused the trauma. Every expert will tell you that no child needs a dysfunctional family and that it's always better to have a single mum who knows how to keep herself safe in order to teach her child how to do the same than to have parents who remain in an unsolvable dysfunctional situation. If nothing of what I wrote resonated with you, I hope this will make you realize you need to prioritize your own safety way more. You need to be that one role model your child can always look up to - that does not need a father or a man or a family, but only you as the wonderful woman you are. Children can sense such things when they can't even articulate themselves. The older they get, the more they sense, and it's always more than we ""stupid"" adults think. Anger, sadness, pain, betrayal - children know. They might not know exactly what is going on, might not understand it, but they'll know, and they'll suffer from having no control over the situation, for blaming themselves or for seeing their parents suffer without being able to ""help"". Please keep this in mind. 

Now, what's left are a few keywords you should educate yourself about, and a few links. Keywords: betrayal trauma; trauma bonding; codependency; narcissism (please use books for that, not solely the internet); depthpsychology oriented psychotherapy; psychoanalysis; trauma therapy (EDMR); C-PTSD; C-PTSD related trauma responses (see link below); emotional abuse; gaslighting.

The best place for you to visit frequently: 

reddit.com/r/CPTSD 

In the sidebar of that wonderful subreddit you can find a book; it's called ""Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving"" and it's written by Pete Walker. Somebody else recommended it to me in the past and I can honestly say it changed my life. I know, I know, that sounds fishy, but it's the truth. I had no idea I deal with trauma, but this wise person read it through my words and told me to read the book. It focuses on childhood trauma primarily, but as I said before, trauma repeats itself, and it really shocked me when I realized my trauma did not begin with my first boyfriend, but rather in my childhood. But that doesn't have to be the same for you, the parts that refer to childhood trauma can also be read with a partner or someone else in mind. It's a very good book and the best place to get a better understanding of what trauma even is. Also, read through the entire sidebar of that subreddit. You should also read posts over there frequently. I found that many of the users there have the frawn-response as primary trauma response and I am very sure that a lot of there findings and descriptions will reasonate with you. 

Next...
 
reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism and reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse

oh well... as I said above, read through top posts from all time or something and look out if any of the traits that are often mentioned sound familiar to you. Again, if you have any questions - send me a PM.

Our linked post. Read everything in there about recovery and how it's essential and of course everything about betrayal trauma. 

One last word: in some articles it might be recommended to do couple therapy, which often makes sense. But before you even consider that, you must do your homework and educate yourself on emotional abuse and gaslighting as much as possible. A good manipulator is able to manipulate a therapist. So if a manipulative person is not willing to actually change, it doesn't even make sense to try. That just as a sidenote. 

Let me know what you think."
loveafterporn,fdk8xnq,t1_fdk8vk2,1578498761.0,"
You say you have a lot of compassion for him, which again reminds me of frawn. I often have more compassion with PAs than most people here, because I've been in the PA's shoes myself a long time ago.. but I would like you to further dig on this (feel welcomed to write me your findings). What exactly do you have compassion for? For how addictive behaviour works? That is great, it makes you a very empathic person! But what does that have to do with secretly taking private and videos photos of another person? Because it doesn't. I don't want to annoy you by talking about those pics and vids all the time, but it is crystal clear that you don't see the severity yet (I'm not trying to shame you and I'm also very sure someday you WILL see it, you're just not there yet). It is something completely different to porn usage. Sex addiction in general will always hurt the partner and therefore never only affects the addict. The partner's trust breaks and slowly dies, they might develop betrayal trauma or other mreliaental health problems, but at least they are always safe in an objective kind of sense. You are not, because your right of privacy has been violated; he has taken videos and pictures of you of which you will never know whether there are copies left. This is how revenge porn originates in the first place, and this safety of knowing that your most private stuff will always be YOUR private stuff and that you have 100% control over it ... it's gone, and it is gone without you consenting to it. It's gone forever because he took that from you, he decided that for you. I have taken pictures and videos with sex partners before and it's now my own responsibility to know that I can never be sure what happened to those files. But I consented to do it, so I knew which risk I'd take. You didn't. It doesn't even matter whether you have sent him such pictures before, or whether someone else has such pictures of you, so if that is the case, please don't even try to minimalize this fact. Because you have not consented to be filmed/photographed in those very moments, but someone who is supposed to keep you safe no matter what decided to do exactly that, to film and to photograph you. He not only ignored the basic principle of consent, privacy, law and human respect; he proved to you that he is willing to take an important part of your personal life at risk and that goes beyond porn addiction. It reminds me of that woman who told us a few weeks ago she got a STD from her cheating husband. These are aspects of your personal life that if invaded should mean immediate end of relationship, because if you don't respect those essential, basic parts of your own being... please believe me, no one who's not a very great person will. 

Back to what I said about your anger. Same goes with the other two essential things you're dealing with, pain and mistrust. As with your anger, you depict your pain and mistrust as something that you are dealing with right now and that you want to get rid off. At this point of our evaluation this almost sounds like self-harm, because now that you're probably starting to realize that your husband is not the loving, reliable, safe person you signed up for and probably will never be, you're trying to force yourself to mute those feelings and natural responses so that they stop torturing you. Whatever it is you are hoping to find here, whether it is advice, understanding, book recommendations... or even therapy ... it is not going to lessen those feelings. If you decide to do therapy (which is really the only thing you should focus on), it is going to increase them because they are already screaming at you ""GET SAFE, GET SAFE, PLEASE GET SAFE!"". It will increase them to a point where you'll hear them and understand what they tell you. And what will follow is a pain so deep that it is gonna feel like you're dying, but eventually you'll actually be newborn. And THEN you can work on trusting another person again.
 
I can't imagine there's a way with your husband for you to heal, to get back this trust and loosen up the anger. That is because of all of the things I said about him already, but even more because of the fact that - based on what you told us - he doesn't sound like he will ever acknowledge that HE must work on all of those things, and not you. We have the pereception that PAs who have never acted out in any other way than watching porn often NEED severe treatment in order to heal from their addiction. CSAT, group meetings, sponsor, lifelong commitment, dedication and willingness to overcome the addiction. Your husband has definitely mental health issues that go beyond that, I associated him with typical narcissistic traits when I read your text. If he hasn't decided yet that he needs to change even though you've decided to seperate, I think chances are low that he ever will. If he has narcissistic traits or even is a narcissist, it's just statistically unlikely that he will choose to realize that HE is causing the problems, not you. I'm gonna link you a subreddit where you can educate yourself further on narcissistic abuse in relationships. It's definitely not the best source for objective information because, oh well, reddit hates that personal disorder to a point where it's not objective anymore, but I think it might help you identify more of his behaviour as problematic, things that you might not have recognized yet - I'm talking about ""little things"" such as behaviour on a daily basis, communication... the manipulative ways people with narcissistic traits have to control others around them without those people noticing. If you have any questions in regard to those narcissistic traits, please write me a PM whenever you want. Not because I've suffered from that as a partner, but because I've educated myself on this very issue for a long time due to personal reasons."
loveafterporn,fdk8vk2,t1_fdfahys,1578498724.0,"Well, you've known him for years and I have never met him, so I don't have to be right on this one... but I definitely do see him as the predator, yes, without any doubt. I am not one to judge every addict as an asshole or a predator only because their actions have hurt someone else, because I know what the term ""addiction"" means. But the things that I mentioned above... the fact that he was willing to take those pictures and videos without your consent only to THEN share them with someone else... and also the fact that he was willing to exploit a GIRL ... make it clear that we are not only talking about addiction. Most addicts will turn to more extreme porn categories, or even start paying cam girls, few will look up prostitutes ... this kind of stuff. All while keeping all of those things secrets, because they are addicted and therefore want the addiction to keep going and since they know someone else knowing would mean they probably can't continute their behaviour, they will try everything to keep it alive by hiding it. Your husband however blantly chose to tell you about the things. He still makes jokes about related topics, which is a 100% proof that he hasn't even begun to reflect. Which is not surprising, because as I explained, to me he sounds like a dangerous person in general. 

Yes, I am very sure that somewhere buried inside you there is something hidden that keeps you in that helpless position. It might be the stockholm syndrom, it is very possible that this is a well hidden betrayal trauma, which means you might be trauma bonding. 

I don't know if you've heard of C-PTSD, it's a form of PTSD that someone can develop after experiencing multiple or even a single trauma, and this trauma does not always have to include violence or a car accident. In that context, there are 4 main ""trauma responses"" that traumatized people may have as a way to react when they subconsciously feel like they're in danger. It's a survival mode those people switch to, because someone or sth has triggered the initial trauma memory and then the trauma response happens without them even realizing because the brain has detected ""danger!"" and tries to protect by fighting back agressively (fight-response), hiding immediately and completely shutting down (freeze-response) or running away and finding shelter in overworking or similar ""safe"" habits (flight-response). However, there is a 4th, less popular response and that is the frawn-response. This one is particularly damaging to the traumatized person because it's what keeps them in the dangerous relationship, situation etc permanently. Example: a child that experiences repetitive childhood trauma due to a lack of love and affection from maybe narcissistic parents and is shamed by the parents often for having human emotions, for not being perfect and similar screwed ideas might react to the constant feeling of being unsafe by developing a frawn-response. Instead of running away or trying to defend itself, the child will try to understand its abuser's emotions, thoughts and needs to a point where it will know them better than the abuser. It will then try to act in a way that it thinks will please the abuser as an attempt to lessen their abusive behaviour. Frawn people are usually very nice people who will listen way more than they talk, who will aim to create a perfect symbioses because they believe that they lessen the danger by adapting perfectly, by accepting flaws, by trying to solve the abuser's problems and by creating a closeness by always being available, reliable, understanding and comforting. Many survivors have a main and a secondary trauma response. Many people with C-PTSD have no idea they've been traumatized in the first place, they either think something is wrong with them in general or they think they are just unlucky / making bad choices for always ending up in the same situations - which is not true. They end up in the same situations because it's the only way the brain has learnt to go, and it aims to repeat that over and over again which unfortunately will worsen the trauma... until the circle is interrupted by getting educated about the trauma. The frawn type is especially vulnerable to ending up with a abusive person, or multiple abusers even. They are often mistaken with co-dependent people, which however makes sense because both have many similarities. 

Based on what I read from you, I am not so sure whether you can identify with what I wrote. But with an objective view on your situation and your writing from outside, I think it's very likely that you are suffering from something that you are not aware of yet. I don't think it's that you just ended up with him and he turned out to be a bad person and now you don't know what to do. Not every woman that ends up here is traumatized. Trauma does not necessarily show by experiencing a lot of pain. In fact it might very well be the opposit. Especially frawn types will probably not realize their own suffering due to the power imbalance I've described above. There simply is no room for that. 

What makes me think so is that you have adapted to the situation in a way that reminds me of that frawn type (not diagnosing you, just saying it popped up in my mind when I read your text). You have mentioned that anger you're dealing with, but I don't see you acting angrily. You seem to keep it more to yourself, maybe because you think it'd be destructive to let it out? Well, that is probably the unhealthiest thing you could do with that anger - proven by the fact that it doesn't work which is why you're now here asking for help. Thing is, your anger is a human emotion that is not only ""justified"" (emotions don't need a justification) but 100% inevitable in your situation. He has treated you with the worst disrespect possible, by exploiting you (the pics and vids) in your home, which is supposed to be your safest place on earth. He also did that while you were carrying what is supposed to be a result of love and intimacy. He would be supposed to cherish, to admire you, yet he treated you like a piece of meat that he could do with whatever he pleases. And yet here you are, trying to find ways to work on your anger. This reminds me of the frawn type because it reminds me of the child that would be hit by an abusive mother but would still try to understand why mum hit it so that they can help her get more comfortable. Anger is a natural response, not only to keep us safe but also to even make our relationships healthy ones. If anger is suppressed, it's gonna find a way to direct at ourselves. Anger often controls our behaviour and we often do not even realize we're angry because it's covered up with other feelings and thoughts. And again, this is way worse with frawn types because in their submissive positions, there's simply no room for anger. 

The submissive position is what brings me to my next point. You have mentioned your lack of options several times now. If that is true, it must mean you are missing a support system. Own family, friends, a safe workplace, therapy, social workers, self-help groups... could be anything, but we NEED these things. If you really have no one to turn to, no system surrounding yourself to rely on, no friend to visit for at least a few weeks when things go south... that has a reason and I bet that reason is not you. Because again, whether it's co-dependence, frawn-type trauma, stockholm syndrom or something else - people who endure living in destructive or abusive relationships often end up having no one for the obvious reasons."

I am sorry, but this is not only about porn and related issues, this is much worse. He recorded you having sex without your consent, and that is not only a cruel way of disrespecting you, it is also illegal. This is not a mistake, it's not a relapse, it's illegal for a reason. He is a criminal. Maybe u/Hmack1 could give her opinion on this, since she as a therapist knows how to handle things, but since there are thousands of PAs who manage their addiction without recording their partner during sex without their consent I'd say there's something seriously wrong with him besides being an addict. 

Also, the fact that he contacted an 18 year old girl is something that I personally find worse than the usual shit many PAs do. She may be an adult in legal terms, but she's still only 18. The fact that he contacted her even though he is in a natural position of power since she's some kind of employee makes things even worse. Not to mention the fact that he did that while you were in a hospital. 

I don't think it will do you any good to label those two things cheating because it is way too dangerous for that. Some people cheat, yeah, may it be porn or a real affair, but exploiting a barely adult person who is in a general vulnerable position while the wife is in hospital, after he had previously filmed his wife during sex without her consent?

To ME, which doesn't mean I'm going to tell others ""he cheated on you and it's just as bad as if he had sex with another person"". And I ask you two to do the same. It makes me pretty mad to see such comments, from both sides. This is a place for support, NOT for telling others what you guys think they should / shouldn't feel. Therefore both of you are wrong. There's only one person in this thread who's ought to decide whether they feel cheated on or not and that is OP. Stop making generalzing assumptions about what is or is not cheating and start asking questions. ""Hey OP, do you feel like he cheated on you?"" instead of saying ""porn isn't cheating"" or ""Porn is definitely cheating because ___"". Especially in this subreddit it is important to give people the room to decide for themselves. Some people come here and say they're fine with porn usage in general - that's okay. Some people come here and are hurt by the porn but don't allow themselves to regard it cheating in order to not feel SO desperate - okay.

It is false to say that about a PA just like it's false to say it about any kind of addiction. Your username already explains why, addictions mainly happen in the brain and relapses are not necessarily a sign of not trying hard enough. Recovery in general is a long way to more self-awareness and understanding for the ego, and relapses can help increase that understanding. It can help identify triggers and underlying issues that lead to relapses or the addiction in general in the first place. The very core of any addiction is that it's not possible to simply stop, that willpower is not enough.  It's not like not eating that piece of chocolate because you promised yourself to try your best to eat healthier. Addiction bases on unsolved problems and inner demons that keep haunting the addict. Not justifying any of the pain that is caused in the process, but I definitely won't justify such a generalizing take on addiction either."

loveafterporn,fcyeg23,t3_ejja2h,1578078911.0,"Hi, 

I think we - you and me - view sex very differently, but monogamy in the same way. I'm the type of person who does not need love or deep emotions for sex by any means ... I view sex as the best possible way to share passion, lust and fun - kinda like I also feel about going to a theme park or doing something similar. I think you'd say I take sex lighty, and that's just fine because people are different and that's okay. 

The reason I comment is because I still feel exactly like you do about monogamous relationships and I think this is the sticking point here. 

As soon as we enter a relationship, we refrain from millions of other ""possibilities"" in favour of just one. We commit, we say ""fuck it, this is the one person I am going to give my all now"". That's the absolute foundation of a monogamous relationship, which is why society has agreed to consider sex outside of that relationship cheating. The fact that pornography includes other people and connects them to the viewer's sexual pleasure is still dismissed by a large amount of people, but that doesn't mean it's not true. There will always people who disagree with the premise that porn is cheating in a relationship - which is fine, because everyone has got the right to define cheating according to their own emotions, needs and values - , but it's perfectly fine if you feel that porn is cheating. I do so, too, and I think this is where it gets really interesting. Because it's extremely possible to regard porn usage cheating, no matter how one regards sex in general. The point is that we're talking about monogamous relationships, not sex. 

You have every right to define what monogamy means to you, just like people who think porn usage is perfectly fine have the right to feel like that as well. It doesn't make you crazy, because if it did, where would be the line between crazy and not crazy and who would determine these nuances? People who judge others as crazy only because of a boundary they have are nothing but dumb. It doesn't make you controlling, because if it did, why would a statement like ""I don't want you to kiss other people"" not be controlling? People always argue with ""privacy"", but I've never seen someone being able to explain why a kissing someone else while being away wouldn't be part of that ""privacy"". It doesn't make you insecure, because if it did it would be impossible for a very self-confident person with a stable self-worth to feel the same way about it. 

What you do is that you question society's definition of a monogamous relationship because you feel like you don't agree with those determined boundaries. You don't want to settle for someone who is not willing to give you as much as you're willing to give, and that's a great thing that you should be proud of. You are not controlling, you simply want to have control over whom you give your love to. You are not insecure, in fact you are brave and confident for choosing your own way instead of simply agreeing with what many people think you should agree with. 

So yeah, I agree a hell lot with your view of porn usage and general sexualization in a monogamous relationship. I always laugh when I see people talking shit about us ""insecure, sex-negative, vanilla"" women. As I mentioned in the beginning, I love sex and I don't need a relationship or love for sex. I have a high sex drive and love to experiment a lot, and I'm pretty much the opposit of an insecure person when it comes to my body and looks. I could totally picture myself in an open relationship... and still I'm as anti-porn as one can be when it comes to relationships because it contradicts everything I associate with monogamy. If I settle for anyone, I want it to be worth it, which means I'm not gonna overlook things I don't want to be part of my relationship. Simple as that."

We found each other, but when we got together I was careful to not fall in love too hard before I had ""the talk"" with him 3 months in. I had the plan to leave if it would be obvious we had different takes on porn. Well, it turned out I was lucky because he has similar POVs, even if it is for different reasons than mine. We're now together since 2.5 years and everything, I mean really every little thing is completely different to everything I've had before. Sex, romance, conversations, emotions, how close we are... it's crazy how many things are affected by using NO porn whatsoever. It's not only that the porn is gone, it's more like how everything about him is different... how he sees women, relationships, monogamy, marriage, society and the world. So yeah, it's possible and now that porn is critized and questioned more and more, it gets more possible... but it's still rare and it's gonna take a lot of time until it's more common among people (not only men). If I hadn't got lucky, I'd rather be alone than with someone who is not like my bf... and I'd be happy. I don't need a man, I don't need a relationship. It's possible to be happy on your own.

loveafterporn,fckoyg8,t3_ehmqn4,1577730050.0,"Sounds like the difference to you is the sexualization of a woman. During a kissing scene the focus often is on the characters feelings, shared experiences, love and/or lust... the meaning of the kiss... and so on. Scenes where a woman undresses / is already naked often solely base on the sexualization of said woman. And that seems to be the difference you see. I think many of us share that sentiment. Explain it to your bf from that POV. Even if a person does not struggle when faced with sexualization, they should be capable of telling the difference between sexualization / objectification and romance / lust / relevant scenes for the story of a movie."

It's really a very common problem that men are being reduced to their looks by women who rather subscribe to male (soft)porn accounts on Instagram."

I've had this idea too and I plan on asking at NoFap or pornfree if someone who knows how to make good apps would be interested in planning something in that direction.

But it would require a lot of planning and some concrete ideas before getting started. I've even considered creating the app on my own as I'm gonna learn that in my studies, but that would take some more years for me to get there :/ 

I've also wondered whether a subreddit dedicated to that purpose would be a good alternative until such an app will be realized. There are plenty of dating subreddits for several preferences, so why not one for pornfree relationships?"
