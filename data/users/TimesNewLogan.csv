Mr. Bradley was making good money off of selling lithographs of Lincoln, until a little girl wrote a letter telling the future president he would look better with a beard.  Now all the lithographs were worthless, and customers were coming in demanding refunds because they weren't accurate.  So the now-bankrupt Milton Bradley burned all his lithographs and fell into a deep depression, during which he sketched out ""The Checkered Game of Life.""

It became America's first popular parlor game overnight, and kicked off decades of wealth and success, and a brand that lasts to this very day, over 150 years later.  Just goes to show, you never know when your fortunes will change."
