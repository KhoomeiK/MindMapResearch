I’ve considered having a friend walk him since I have one that lives right down the block, but I already walk my dog a decent amount so I don’t want to over-exercise him. I have a camera, but only my mom uses it, I haven’t got it set up on my phone yet. I figure I’ve done everything I could, I just have to make myself ok with it haha."
college,fej4h4v,t1_fej2fog,1579156558.0,"Hey, srry for the late reply. I go to a big-ish university, and I actually live with my parents within the city. It's about 20,000 kids last time I checked, so it's big but not unbearable."
college,feio7rf,t1_feinyct,1579143134.0,"Hey, thanks a ton for your offer, but I think I’m gonna focus on reaching out physically for the moment. I’m actually reasonably ok at talking online, I just need a push to go a bit further haha. Though again, thanks a ton for offering, it really means a lot :)"
college,fdz0ro5,t1_fdyrn8o,1578785498.0,"I’ve tried pirating, but I can never figure out how to get it to work and I never seem to learn as well if I’m not taking the info from a physical textbook. I’ve made a rule for myself that I’ll pirate any textbook that’ll run me 80 dollars or more, and thankfully I haven’t found any north of that amount yet."
college,fdvxjpa,t1_fdvqp7s,1578752864.0,How do you do that tho?
college,fd0beow,t1_fd0b39x,1578116434.0,"Yeah, I think I will take something else. I need natural science credits, so I was thinking of taking an astronomy course that still has a few open spots, definitely going to see if I can do that. Thanks a lot for your advice!"
college,fd071bu,t1_fd06pom,1578114594.0,"I should have explained further. I went to an arts school with a focus on writing from 6th grade to 12th grade, so I have a really good grasp on the basics and don't feel they need polishing up. The main reason I came to hate writing so much is because of the repetition of it I went through in high school and middle school, and my inability to write as well as my peers. The course my mom wants me to take is creative writing, not nonfiction or research based."
college,fcyvleu,t1_fcysvl5,1578088037.0,"For me, I went into it with that state of mind because I had no idea what I wanted to study, but knew I wanted to go to college. Plus, I figured major programs and the campus didn’t matter at all, since it always seemed to me that the vast majority of colleges are pretty much identical"
college,fcxqqri,t1_fcxqezf,1578069191.0,"I mean, nothing matters if you can’t afford it and can’t go in the first place. I don’t see the reason not to take time figuring things out, that’s what I’m doing and it’s working out great because of all the financial aid I’ve gotten. TBH, I’ve never really wanted to be anything or been passionate about a specific major so I can’t really get my head around the idea of sacrificing money just to do one major.  Plus, people change as they get older, no way to tell if he’ll want to be an accountant a few years from now"
college,fcxc7q0,t1_fcxbvqr,1578058924.0,"No problem, sorry for not offering a conclusive answer haha. If you’re still in high school, definitely go to whatever counseling/advising services you have access to and work it out with them. In my experience, they know you better than you think and usually offer pretty good advice. Good luck on whatever you end up doing! :)"
college,fcxb5gr,t1_fcxa3gb,1578057990.0,"In terms of financial aid, I’m actually in the exact same situation haha. Family has no money and no savings, and the only thing keeping me at school is aid. 

Hearing you talk about general studies, it definitely seems like a bad idea. Transfers at my school are a lot easier so I wasn’t really thinking about how difficult they may be elsewhere. If you really are as poor as you say I would definitely recommend taking the full ride, statistics definitely won’t make you as much as accounting but it’s pretty in demand and a pretty good skill set to have. Personally, thinking from your shoes, I would take the full ride and just make the best of statistics. It may not be the most prosperous major and it won’t be what you wanted, but the full ride will allow you to give it your all and invest all your time so you can actually succeed, without burning out. 

If you chose to go for accounting you’d probably have to pick up one or maybe even two part time jobs, and the stress of that plus the stress of school might have a really bad impact on your mental health. Again, everyone’s different and you may be the sort that thrives under pressure, but I most certainly am not and I’m applying my own perspective here. You just have to keep in mind that, if you go for accounting, you will certainly be better off in the future but you may, quite frankly, be miserable in the short term, and you have to think about whether that’s a worthwhile trade off for you. It is only four years, and, though it’ll suck, it’ll probably go by reasonably quickly. I know this isn’t much for advice, but you have to personally decide whether you would rather be comfortable and relaxed in the short term for decent, but not great long term gain or miserable in the short term for greater long term gain. Sorry this isn’t much for advice, but I feel this is a pretty personal situation that can’t be completely solved through anonymous advice on the internet haha. You have to figure out how you deal with stress and pressure, and what major would make you the happiest in terms of both work and money."
college,fcx9prv,t1_fcx8xto,1578056627.0,"Is there a way to start out as undeclared, or with an open option? That way you would have some time to move around and get your gen eds done while further researching a major. The good thing about the better financial aid is it would give you time to do this, whereas, if you were paying out of pocket, you’d probably want to start off in a major right away so as to not waste money. 

I think accounting is a good idea (given the guaranteed salary), but I just don’t know if I’m the sort of person who could juggle academic stress with financial stress each semester. You’re definitely different though, so you should think if that’s something that you’d be willing and able to handle. Obviously it wouldn’t be an issue if your parents were paying for you (though you would still have to worry about keeping a good relationship with them), but if you were paying on your own you’d have to juggle work and school, which would be pretty hard with an academically intense major like accounting. You have to think if that sort of stress is a burden you’re willing to take on, especially considering a guarantee of future reward, and keep in mind it’ll be in addition to everything else."
college,fcx8mgf,t3_ejeuio,1578055542.0,"Full stop, I’d make your decision solely based on how much financial aid you’d be getting. There’s going to be a lot of room to move around and experiment with your major once you start, so I’d focus on going to a school with the best financial deal over a school with the best program or the school you want to go to. Literally the only reason I’m at the school I am now is because of how much aid they offered me, I never gave two shits about the campus or the major programs or any factor outside the tuition and aid. The way I see it, you’ll have time to figure out your major and maybe make some minor changes (since you said transferring is difficult) but at least everything will be paid for. You don’t want to add financial worries onto the existing stresses of college"
college,fcvajop,t1_fcv86yv,1577998064.0,"Oh, that’s fair. But yeah, they definitely probably must have had some sort of appeals process. For example, at my school all freshmen are required to live on campus, but because that was too expensive I appealed for an exception since I’m diabetic and they gave it to me."
college,fcv7nki,t1_fcv6ufl,1577996344.0,"Jesus, that’s insane. Do they have any appeals process? They may let you appeal the requirement if you’re beneath a certain income level or have specific medical conditions (just speculating). Maybe try going to the financial aid office or some equivalent and try to put an appeal in."
college,fcv6dvv,t3_ej3dps,1577995585.0,"That’s definitely strange, my college only requires freshman living on campus to have one. Is there any way for you to appeal or get an exception since you live off campus?"
DCcomics,fcfv66g,t3_eh6o0c,1577634024.0,"Superman, both because I love him as a character (I love simple heroes that inspire people) but also because I’ve never really liked Batman. For whatever reason I’ve just never been able to enjoy or get into any aspect of Batman’s character no matter how many Batman stories I read, I’ve always found him very arrogant and cynical. It always seemed to me like, compared to Superman, Batman was a massive asshole with a far more limited emotional range and a much much lower capacity for empathy and actual heroism, which always put me off the character. I like heroes that actually care about and inspire people, and I’ve never seen any of that from Batman."
dating_advice,fbz2sy6,t1_fbz2kla,1577233371.0,"I didn't phrase it right. I can talk to others, I just have trouble maintaining conversation, relating to people, and forming long lasting relationships. People terrify me and make me immensely uncomfortable, and I've only been really comfortable around one person in my life. I've been doing pretty well so far, so I don't see a need to change. 

Regarding the second point, I figure that being in a relationship is something you have to have a certain level of social skills to do. I figure feelings are irrelevant, as only people with a certain set of skills can actually act on them and enter into a relationship. I've never really had feelings for anyone this far in my life (except for that friend I mentioned, though I didn't see any point in trying to start a relationship since my social skills aren't advanced enough)."
