They might have a 50 year infancy period, then 50 further years of maturity, then 800+ years as an adult, depending on life expectancy. I’m just judging from Yoda’s age, which might be lower, or the same as the life expectancy of his species.

900 - 100 = 800 (possible life expectancy of Yoda’s species - maturity)

70 - 18 = 52 (life expectancy of human male - maturity)

900 / 700 = 12.8571 (average human year to Yoda year comparison)

100 / 18 = 5.5555... (human year to Yoda year for maturity)

800 / 52 = 15.3846 (human year to Yoda year during adulthood)

My age: 43

X = 43 * 12.8571 

X = 552.8553 (Averaged)

Or

X = (18 * 5.5555....) + ((43 - 18) * 15.3846)

X = 100 + (25 * 15.3846)

X = 100 + 384.615
