Bondedpairs,feyeilv,t1_fey2dyr,1579444399.0,"I had no trouble with any of the three I brought in at different times but I knew the personality of each one. All three were very social and when a new cat came in, they took a few weeks to get over it and then blossomed with a new cat. If your five year old is friendly and a little restless I’d definitely say to go rescue a senior. If you get one over 9 years old, they’ll be so thankful they’ll be a purrfect addition to your family. Imho"

AskReddit,feuovtb,t3_eqnw1i,1579388619.0,"I was about to go on a date and then I decided to do some research on my new Prince Charming. Found the local headline “Wig Wearing Bank Robber Finally Arrested”. When i called him out on it he said “But I didn’t give you my last name?” 

Long story short it launched my company of dating detectives because i got sick of this bullshit. [Aste](www.aste.io)"

cats,fdleplf,t1_fdlchwg,1578522426.0,"Oh man, if you saw these two IRL you’d be so in love! Honestly the only thing I can think of is rescuing seniors.. they just seem to appreciate and love more. Also, I spoil them and I have no human kids so they are my children and I love the shit out of them. My wish for you is that one of your next non bonded pairs bond and make your day every day!"

cats,fdkxfak,t1_fdktxmc,1578513144.0,"Hahahaha this heating pad makes them feel like billionaires!! They’re so happy on it! And they took only a week, and then they were instant bff. They spend all day spooning and cleaning each other. It makes my heart so full. Both of them were rescued from horrific situations and they saved me too. The best babies ❤️"
caloriecount,fdksp0n,t1_fdks1mz,1578510348.0,6lbs of water weight in the first week - I do 20/4 fasting and also throw in a 42 hour fast as well. I was doing this up till the holidays with great results but got wayyyy off track. I feel so much better not. I hope by Feb 1 to have measurable results :) Good luck to you!!! Reach out anytime!
fasting,fdk87g4,t1_fdjk12n,1578498296.0,I'm back on the fasting train after the holidays - it was the only thing that worked for me last year.  So now i'm doing 20/4 with a weekly 48 - how long have you been doing this for and how are the results for you?
caloriecount,fdk7eju,t3_elgrr5,1578497779.0,"I'm doing 800 as well - I'm truly satisfied with my days.  350 for lunch, 350 for dinner and 100 calorie snack.  Eating huge salads, omelettes, chicken and veg, etc.  I'm on day 7 and at the gym every day too - so far so good :)  Keep it going!"
