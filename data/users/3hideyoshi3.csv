runescape,felew78,t3_epot66,1579220548.0,"u/JagexJD on mobile, when switching items from inventory or other tabs with other items in the bank I've had items turn invisible and ""vanish"" from my bank instead of swap. Usually when it's trying to push an item to the side instead of flat out swap. Though I've seen 3 people say their items have vanished completely whereas mine were found through the search bar exclusively.

personalfinance,fe2j4t8,t3_en8ap1,1578838963.0,"Go to the station in question and sort it out. Talk to an inhouse attorney if needed. 

I got a speeding ticket back in 2016 and when I went to pay it they said ""you're not in the system, the cop may have not reported it. You're lucky."" That's literally what she said. So I went on with my day. 

a year later I get pulled over because I was listening to a comedy track and laughing my ass off. The cop followed me from the bar I worked at, pulled me over for suspected drunk driving. My laughing caused some swerving. Ran my license after I explained I'm simply an idiot and tells me  to step out of the car. Says he needs to take me to jail, I'm being arrested for a speeding ticket I missed a court date for and they put a warrant out for my arrest. I explained that I already went to the station and tried to pay it. 

He saw my military ID when he gave my license back and started randomly asking me about that, aparently he was in to and gave me the benefit of the doubt. Made me have someone pick me up and said he would have to pick me up if I didnt go to the courthouse to fix the situation the next day.

Turns out, after spending 30 minutes convincing the lady I do in fact gave an outstanding ticket and talking to an attorney(which cost me nothing), the attorney goes down with me and between the two of them they find out the cop spelt my name wrong and that's why they couldnt look it up. It's on my license! Its CHRIS. Tf?

So long winded explanations aside, err TL;DR? Idk I dont post stories much. Going to the courthouse and persistently trying to figure it out made them realise they screwed me over almost."
