This is a non-story, and there is no conspiracy here. Using the first amendment to avoid being served is completely legal!

Edit: Also SS cannot be served on her behalf. Only lawyers can accept in your place with your authorization depending on the state and process law."

There is no law you need to open your door, simply that you cannot run away or lie to avoid being served. You can also refuse to accept service documents or have your attorney refuse to accept on your behalf. 

They will simply serve you in a different manner."

Shit better hope the terrorist don't catch wind of this one loophole ex-presidents don't want you to know. 

They simply don't allow uninvited people to come past the gate. When serving high level people you generally go through a different channel. This is sensational bullshit."

There is no fantasy I hold in hurting someone, aside from aforementioned saving all my coworkers a-la Die Hard, which is not an actual fantasy and more a boredom daydream many people will confirm they have probably entertained at some point in their life."

But if someone is still walking up to a house with two large dogs barking inside, I would remember where I'm at as well, and the fact they probably have guns and their current action speak that they are prepared to use them. Preparation and casual thought is far from fantasy.

If someone kept coming towards my home with them barking, I'd be glad I live in Texas. If they kept approaching it would mean they had some plan to deal with my dogs and I would say that's a verifiable threat no jury would convict a homeowner over."
politics,ffskxwd,t1_ffsj25y,1580184272.0,"Your ""article"" uses a trip in 1988 to prove Kremlin ties with no additional evidence.
We have multiple GOP senators going to Russia to meet with Kremlin officials and two connections to illegal money funneling into the GOP with direct connections to Trump and his personal attorney from just last year.

It also doesn't even reflect your claim of only 2 bills in 40 years, but instead says 7 in 28 missing 12 years. There are numerous other things inconsistence with your post and your own article, so I can tell this is a dead end. I hope others don't fall for this propaganda."

There is 0% chance he worked with the Russians or is a stooge for them. 

Otherwise, something would have come out by now showing he was dirty. Here's been a civil rights activist his whole life and has been consistent in the way he votes. Like him or hate him, he's not owned by Russia like the GOP is right now."

gaming,ffe8wke,t1_ffe3lk6,1579839921.0,"$350 to turn into a large profit is rich

 Even at my poorest if I found an opportunity to double, let alone triple my investment, I would have done it. I've been homeless and was able to put back money and turn profit.

 $350 is nothing if you're willing to work. You can make $100+ in a day just mowing lawns, doing manual labor, ride share, deliveries, or many other ""side hustles"".

It's a hustle, he also took a risk in them saying he couldn't sale the second or third batch. 

Sounds like he also didn't have enough disposable income to get them all at once to flip them. 

If risking $350 makes you rich, you're either still a child, or fiscally irresponsible.

 If $350 makes someone rich, I really wonder why most people care about the stock market being the ""highest"", when it has no impact on their world at all.

 If $350 is the difference between you being rich or poor, you need to reevaluate your life, or go to bed because you have class in the morning."

Really need to understand what the difference of a $1,000,000 vs $500,000,000 is for this to make sense.

1 million seconds equal 11 and 1/2 days.

1 billion seconds equal 31 and 3/4 years.

gaming,ff7yu7c,t1_ff78xpj,1579661625.0,"3 copies of ""Misadventures of Tronne Bonne""  over here. Already sold 2 for $180 and $210 respectively. I also have multiple black lable copies of all the PS1 Final Fantasies, Mega Man Legends 2, and Tail Concerto. 

I started grabbing copies of these and many other PS1 games back when they were still selling for $30-50 when PS2 came out and I realized it was $80-120 for Earthbound.

 Turned out to be way more lucritive than the bags of Beanie Babies I inherited. Even though that contained all the ""$10,000+"" babies like the princess Diana one and the crab and all that shit. 

Can't sell a single one of those, but I've paid rent from selling a few copies of FF7 back in the day. 

Garage sales and trade days in small counties are still the best place to find things like this. Ma and Pa game stores and rental places all had to shut down in the past 10 years and a lot of them unload storage at these trade days. Look for things like First Monday, which was one here in Texas that I scored all these at a few years back."

Used to buy broken systems off people for real cheap. A lot of times friends would just give them to me actually. So then repair them and sale them. 

I also used to dump the PS3 firmware and was active in the community with maintaining hacks and even using Karens tools to be able to spoof firmware version so you could play online with jailbroken systems."
todayilearned,feyw91l,t1_feyq7d2,1579451243.0,"The firmware crack and TI-84 sideload happened late 2011.

At the time I worked somewhere that ordered drives wholesale and was able to purchase extra *stock at a heavy discount, so it wasn't that expensive. 

Blockbuster carried all the new games at the time which would still cost 30-50 used, so it was still extremely lucrative at the time."
todayilearned,feyouz3,t1_feykz6z,1579448488.0,"They also offered the gamepass with the same rules.

This happened around the same time the PS3 was hacked. I lived a block from the Blockbuster at the time.

I bought a 1tb external HDD back then, and made 20 trips over a week cloning all the games, then cancelled the membership.

 The teens working there were confused by seeing me so much, but since I wasn't violating any policy just kept letting me show up every few hours and swap the games out. I would go home, download to the HDD; which took about 30 mins to an hour; and return the games for new ones. 

The perfect crime."

AdviceAnimals,fes3184,t1_fervm28,1579360920.0,"WoW had been around for 16 years. I strongly doubt this is some sponsored post.

Managing a guild or clan online is actually a lot of work and a lot of people don't understand that. I was part of a clan that used military rankings for CS:S and the higher you were, the more responsibility expected to maintain rank. I also ran a couple of other CS:S clans that played in CAL:I/CPL based out of Plano TX. Which if you're familiar with back then you would know some members went on to having contracts with PC manufactures and we're some of the worlds first ""professional"" gamers. 

 Even though it's ""just a game"" , administration of a server; handling patches; maintaining mods; getting rid of hackers; keeping the peace; keeping morale up for 100's of members; collecting donations/fees to pay for it all; scheduling meetings to discuss all of the above; scriming and coming up with strategy; ect... are all a lot of work, especially when it's all volunteer work."
