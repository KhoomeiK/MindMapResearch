antiMLM,ffexh44,t3_et7t96,1579869422.0,I'm so sorry this happened to you. These people sound extremely predatory for targeting someone that appeared extremely vulnerable.
fatlogic,ffc7n5m,t1_ffc6459,1579793411.0,Do you remember the name of the study by any chance?
fatlogic,ffbl6cq,t1_ffb1v7m,1579770685.0,"That's an interesting point, although it would be interesting to see if sugar activates the same system to the same extreme level (although I'm not saying that sugar is totes not addictive at all)."
fatlogic,ff9mhbg,t1_ff9m983,1579716088.0,That's true. Moderation can be extremely difficult.
antiMLM,ff8zww0,t1_ff8y7ho,1579701257.0,"It sucks imo because the ""recruiters"" make these MLMs sound absolutely amazing. And sometimes even intelligent people seem to not realise that a lot of the claims are just too good to be true."
antiMLM,ff8vhnq,t3_es808g,1579697481.0,"Well done on calling this person out. Unfortunately, as she's claiming to be a nurse, she'll probably be seen as someone with authority who knows what she's doing. Therefore it's even more important to call her out imo."
fatlogic,ff8r2ub,t3_es9uxi,1579692631.0,"I think sugar is only not so great if you eat, like, a metric fuck-tonne of it. There is such thing as a sensible amount."
fatlogic,ff5pmpo,t3_ermqnt,1579604951.0,I'd love to try skiing with paper skis :p
fatlogic,fezhte9,t3_eqyzqn,1579457491.0,"I can't speak for everyone, but I'm personally losing weight to decrease my chances of diabetes."
fatlogic,fezf7q4,t3_eqn0mo,1579456716.0,"To be honest, I'm glad that the client was able to discover that they like certain vegetables. I like to think that's a  good start."
SuperMorbidlyObese,fenqtf5,t1_fei258z,1579289483.0,"Swimming is good too apparently.  I think it's low impact on the joints, and it also exercises the whole body. Not sure whether this will help with your ""man boobs"", but hopefully the water might provide some support."
SuperMorbidlyObese,fenpqba,t3_epe74c,1579289071.0,It might be helpful to look on meetup.com and see if there are any fitness groups in your area.
SuperMorbidlyObese,fenpfnc,t3_eq4v6h,1579288894.0,"It might be best to stop watching that TLC show if it's worrying you.

Perhaps you can speak to your boyfriend and find out what kind of people his family are? It might be that they're all as sweet as he is."
fatlogic,fel0rxp,t3_eppkz7,1579211597.0,"Let's face it though. It's not as simple as either eating a hamburger or ""trying to starve"". There's a sensible balance somewhere between eating way too much and eating way too little. And it's always to get the correct nutrition needed to function properly.

While these psychologists might be trying to help people have a healthy relationship with food, and while they might be trying to help people that might have had to deal with nastiness over their weight, they're probably not being ad helpful as they're trying to be."
antiMLM,fek1ed3,t1_fejz5c8,1579190534.0,"It's worrying to me because I suspect that there's a lot of unpredictability in forex trading, and I suspect that people could lose a load of money (I could be completely wrong about this). I can't help but suspect that the education isn't as great as it's supposed to be."
fatlogic,fejr6k6,t1_fejf583,1579183801.0,"For all we know this person may well have atypical anorexia. However, judging by what this person wrote, it appears as though the restrictive eating disorder is self-diagnosed rather than diagnosed by a qualified medical professional."
fatlogic,fejqrce,t1_fejaben,1579183486.0,i was wondering the exact same thing.
antiMLM,fejhuun,t1_fejhmtq,1579174941.0,"Imarketslive. They sell ""education"" on forex (foreign exchange (currency)) trading and have ""mentors"". They've already been in trouble over one of their apps but I can't remember exactly what happened."
antiMLM,fejgt55,t3_epgyj6,1579173567.0,"Personally I've seen Avon, Usborne and IML Academy over here. In my personal opinion, IML Academy seems to be the dodgiest out of these three (at least in the UK), but I could be wrong."
fatlogic,fe3wh3t,t1_fe3rnzu,1578853498.0,This is an excellent example of confirmation bias imo.
fatlogic,fdmwg07,t3_em4qws,1578568954.0,"I do think that society shouldn't be pieces of shit to anyone just because of their weight. But at the same time, us overweight folk aren't going to help ourselves by refusing to accept reality."

fatlogic,fdkm3my,t3_eltxt9,1578506386.0,"Is it me, or is this person making a false dichotomy where you're either fat or starving, and nowhere in between?"
fatlogic,fddizf7,t1_fddcfv0,1578314183.0,"The proportions do seem a little unique, and I took a moment to try and make sense of them, but I think you're correct."
fatlogic,fd8syhc,t3_ek7wt9,1578223020.0,"""What to do instead? Reject the entire model."" That's a rather black and white approach..."
fatlogic,fd5lopb,t1_fd5hm8m,1578178806.0,"I think the person also claimed to have bulimia alongside the 'meaningless' 'anorexanorexic tendencies', so they probably do/did have a valid ED diagnosis."
fatlogic,fd5bvl4,t3_ek2pra,1578176054.0,"I've just been reading an [article](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/does-metabolism-matter-in-weight-loss) from Harvard University, and i found this particular paragraph interesting:

""Regardless of whether your metabolism is fast or slow, our bodies are designed to store excess energy in fat cells. So if you eat and drink more calories (energy ""intake"") than your body expends (energy ""output"") you will gain weight. On the other hand, if you eat and drink fewer calories than are burned through everyday activities (including exercise, rest and sleep), you'll lose weight. Our bodies are also programmed to sense a lack of food as starvation. In response, our BMR slows down, which means fewer calories burned over time. That's one reason why losing weight is often difficult.""

To me it seems that while CICO is important, starvation can affect slow a person's metabolism down, making it harder for a person to lose weight. IMO it seems that having 'anorexic tendencies' could genuinely make this person struggle to lose weight, although i could be completely wrong."
fatlogic,fd49v0p,t1_fd40msd,1578165699.0,That's true. We don't hear smokers/alcoholics etc. doing what the HAES movement does.
fatlogic,fd409iq,t1_fd3r4w2,1578163201.0,That's a fair point.
fatlogic,fd3usad,t1_fd3iiro,1578161789.0,i suspect some of the people that take everything as fat phobia probably have issues with their self-esteem or something. If this is the case then they probably need a lot more support than simply encouragement to lose weight.
fatlogic,fd39ps5,t1_fd39efs,1578156095.0,Exactly. A lot of people don't seem to be able to make this distinction.
fatlogic,fd2nhsb,t3_ejwt2k,1578149740.0,"I do think that we shouldn't be mean to anyone over their size.

But at the same time, we certainly shouldn't pretend that being obese is super good if it isn't."
antiMLM,fcsril4,t1_fcsq8j5,1577923275.0,"i'm certainly no geneticist but i think that there maybe a genetic mutation, rather than a genetic deficiency, when it comes to MTHFR. Either way this MLM sounds dodgy and pseudoscientific AF to me."
antiMLM,fcschdm,t3_eilx56,1577914612.0,What exactly is a 'genetic deficiency'? I wonder how much actual peer reviewed science I can find on this...
fuckeatingdisorders,fcffpd0,t1_fcfeulv,1577629521.0,Excellent :D
fuckeatingdisorders,fcf92nj,t1_fcf8gej,1577627717.0,"Ok, good. Please do so if you can."
fuckeatingdisorders,fcf89if,t1_fcf7l64,1577627461.0,Perhaps you can talk about it when you get psychoanalysis?
fuckeatingdisorders,fcf7dgs,t1_fcf75l9,1577627288.0,Maybe she'll realise there's a problem if you mention it on a regular basis?
fuckeatingdisorders,fcf6vn3,t1_fcf4m4r,1577627126.0,Is there anyone else you can get support from?
fuckeatingdisorders,fcf41jq,t1_fcf2ooc,1577626401.0,"Dw, you don't need to apologise :)

I'm sure some people with EDs can continue to feel ok (or maybe even pretend to feel ok) without noticing damage they're doing to their bodies :(

Even if you don't want specific ED therapy, it might be good to speak to a dietitian to make sure you're eating healthily."
fuckeatingdisorders,fcf2i98,t1_fcf0g4z,1577626015.0,"I can't force you to get help, but I do think it's a good idea if you're developing an ED. You might be feeling ok now but I would imagine that a lot of people with EDs start off feeling fine."
fuckeatingdisorders,fcezi4r,t3_eh32l8,1577625198.0,"I would highly recommend seeing a doctor. They should be able to advise you on how to be healthy as well as direct you to any therapy you might need.

Hope you're ok."
loseit,fce9hgq,t1_fcbwog3,1577618291.0,Thanks :)
loseit,fcan06b,t3_egxa6z,1577572480.0,"There's \*always\* hope. i'm older than you and i've lost around 15kg so far (although i'm sure i've put some back on over Christmas). I believe in you :)

Have you tried swimming? Apparently it's low impact so it might be easier on your back and Knees, plus apparently it's generally a good workout if that's what you want/need."
fatlogic,fc5murd,t3_egc5la,1577461739.0,I might actually start using this (as a joke of course)
learnprogramming,fc115xm,t3_efl3o5,1577305297.0,Might be worth looking at the free/cheaper courses if they're equally as good as or better than the expensive one.
