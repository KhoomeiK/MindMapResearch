totalwar,ff3ay4z,t1_ff396f2,1579537641.0,I've won lizard vortex a few times. The ending makes it pretty clear they plan to use the power of the vortex to wipe out the other races. I guess that's technically better than Chaos wiping out the world...
totalwar,ff2heb0,t3_eq3q8i,1579506228.0,"I lost a battle against Gong Du because a unit of Yellow Sky Heralds had one entity left and he would not die. He just stood still, taking hundreds of crossbow bolts and catapult fire, blood spraying out of him the whole time. He was immune to melee and fire damage too. His stats looked normal. No idea what happened."
totalwar,fezmdsg,t3_eqlkbj,1579458970.0,"Three Kingdoms launched with 40 unique characters, up from the 32 originally planned. They didn't have the resources to do more. There is no way they could add 20 for $10, and I honestly doubt people would find new art and models compelling enough to play for long. It makes more sense to add them alongside content.

CA seem to want to add more ""chapter packs""/start dates. I am sure each time they do more unique art will be added in the free patches. For example, Diao Chan got art this time, and she had nothing to do with the DLC. And there was that patch before that added 4 characters, like Jia Xu. We just have to be patient I am afraid."
Grimdawn,feq5f1x,t3_eqacdf,1579337871.0,"The saves storage is a little screwy, especially if switching between local and cloud saves or vice versa. I lost my stuff once too, didn't find a solution."
totalwar,fepbht9,t3_eq7c9d,1579316474.0,Nice work! Hope you are having fun with Repanse! I am surprised she nearly died though. She ended up super tanky in my campaign. She would be unkillable with regeneration! Though I do wish Henri wouldn't upstage her in the kills department so hard...
totalwar,fek3rdt,t1_fejz307,1579191984.0,"When I read the patch notes, I was honestly more hyped about the patch than the DLC lol. Though I am glad the DLC adds Liu Chong to the main campaign there are so many free improvements in the patch that I imagine I could start another new campaign without the DLC and be perfectly happy. Regardless, I will buy the DLC to give the new start date a try and to support further patches like this."
totalwar,fek3e3g,t1_fejvse5,1579191762.0,"> Because the Yellow Turbans are basically the prologue to the part of 3K that most people/games seem to like to focus on. Damn near every narrative of the story I've seen has focused on the toppling on Dong Zhuo and therafter, with like, yellow turban as a brief tutorial.

Fair enough. I haven't played any other games set in the Three Kingdoms period so I was unaware of that.

>And I think that's why more people were asking for content that involved the second generation, so the grand campaign didn't die out once people passed of old age.

Now that you mention it, content focusing on the next generation would indeed be welcome. The campaign does become less interesting if it goes on long enough that all the ""Legendary"" characters die. Maybe that will happen if these chapter packs are popular and we see later start positions added. If not, I honestly don't know what will happen, and I doubt CA does either."
totalwar,fejvc1a,t1_fejp8zn,1579186696.0,"What do you mean by ""big picture people""? And how is the default starting date more associated with the ROTK story then the new Mandate starting date during the height of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, or say a 221 start date once Cao Pi and Liu Bei have declared themselves Emperor of Wei and Shu Han? The default date was simply chosen because it is late enough that all the prominent warlords have risen to, you know, prominence, and it is early enough that none of them have really died, allowing the player to live out the Three Kingdoms period however they might wish. But I am sure there are fans whose favourite moments of the ROTK occurred later on."
totalwar,fejud9a,t1_fejs42a,1579186056.0,"To be fair, they tried something different for their first DLC, Eight Princes, and everybody hated it and said they should get back to the Three Kingdoms period. So that's what they are going to do. Offer a bunch of a different start dates, essentially letting you drop in at any ""chapter"" of the Three Kingdoms period. If each ""chapter pack"" comes with improvements to the campaign like this one has, so each new DLC improves all campaigns, then I am fine with it."
totalwar,fejl3vz,t3_ep7qkn,1579178551.0,I have never seen this in Warhammer. Guess I really am best suited to Normal difficulty.

totalwar,fejksl6,t1_fejhhdv,1579178235.0,"It seems like the campaign is on the same physical map with new starting positions reflecting the time period. It is only set a few years before the campaign so once you hit the time period of the main campaign certain events will happen, such as Zheng Jiang spawning to begin her bandit rebellion thing. I think they are overhyping it, to be honest. It is just like Crusader Kings 2's multiple start dates.

It sounds like they want to do more of these start dates based around the climactic years of the Three Kingdom period. So I imagine eventually you will be able to start your campaign at any one of a number of important/exciting dates. I would guess eventually a start will be available just after the historical three kingdoms have been formed, for example."
EnaiRim,fe8sze9,t3_eo1x2w,1578930423.0,"Guard barracks is the only place I know of to get heaps of drains. If you don't want to rapidly age up as a vampire doing that than I really feel you will be fine just playing normally, keeping an eye out for the odd sleeping bandit. Also, pick up the White Wolf perk as a vampire lord. It lets you drain people affected by Vampire's Seduction even when sated, so that's an extra drain on any NPC every in-game day."
todayilearned,fe8i01o,t1_fe6jz5m,1578926385.0,"There are plenty of suicidal people who you've never even heard of, because they quietly killed themselves in a way that didn't endanger other people. Just google the suicide forest, Aokigahara, in Japan. People just walk out there and die, totally alone. Flashy, dangerous suicides are the minority. This really is a ridiculous overgeneralisation."
todayilearned,fe6grpd,t1_fe68x8r,1578890419.0,"The human body is pretty resilient. Killing yourself can be surprisingly difficult. Furthermore, suicidal people tend to want their pain to end, not to cause themselves more pain during the suicide. So I can understand the appeal of what would be a practically instantaneous death if it goes right, that doesn't need you to do anything other than stand somewhere. The biggest downside is the unfortunate toll it takes on train drivers. Many feel a sense of guilt for being at the ""wheel"" when it happens, though I don't think anyone, including the people who commit suicide, feel they are responsible in any way.

Anyway, most suicidal people are in a twisted, altered state of mind. Their own mind has turned against them and is literally so broken it is trying to overcome the survival instincts and get them to die. They need help, and treatment, and can't really evaluate the damage their actions will cause. For example, if you hate yourself so much you want to die and are convinced that your death will make the world a better place, how could you realise that the train driver will feel psychological turmoil over your death?"
totalwar,fe6fxrg,t1_fe6d7lf,1578889705.0,Thanks. If the patch is coming with more new art and models for currently generic heroes then I hope they do a blog post showing them off like last time.

totalwar,fdq9x74,t3_emkdfm,1578660633.0,"I read in a thread recently that auto-resolve sorts units into categories. Like, melee, ranged and flanking or something. And they each attack different categories. So apparently when you lose your artillery like this it is because the enemy had much more flanking power than you. So your front line fights their front line, but then their flankers, like cavalry or a witch hunter (apparently) fight your flankers, or if you have none, your artillery, then your skirmishers.

I didn't verify any of this myself, and I paraphrased that other guy."

totalwar,fct653v,t3_eimkh4,1577933879.0,"I only really got in to Total War with Shogun 2, on a PC that could barely run the game at all and could not run the battles period. Consequently I started out auto resolving everything. Nowadays I auto resolve the majority of battles that are a clear win via auto resolve unless I want to mix things up watching the enemy get crushed, but I don't do that very often since the load times for the modern games are too long. Like, loading in and out of a small battle in Warhammer 2 is 2-4 minutes each way. You literally win the battles faster than they take to load/unload. Which makes it a serious problem that the auto resolve for WH2 is so fucking inaccurate.

FinalFantasy,fcmdycy,t1_fcmbw8t,1577771811.0,"It's been years, and I won't cheat by checking the wiki, so my memory tells me the weakening Techniks were useless because they didn't work on bosses. Expose may have worked but was also useless since your damage capped at 9999. Honestly, way more JRPGs should ditch the damage limit. It really punishes anything other than auto-attack spam in the endgame. Anyway, I mostly remember dying to Yiazmat spamming that instant death circle magic thing over and over. Pretty sure I had top tier gear and gambits mostly keeping me alive outside of that. Permanent uptime on Bubble, Haste, Protect and maybe Shell (I forget) along with Bravery and Faith, with infinite MP from passives restoring MP on hit and when hit was pretty strong.

I am pretty sure you bought Techniks, yeah. But not sure enough to bet money on it! It really has been too long. The worst grind I did was trying to get bazaar components for the Tournesol.

Question though, in the original partway through the fight Yiazmat got a buff cutting the max damage you do per hit from 9999 to 6999. I understand TZA does not have a damage limit if 9999 in general though. So does something like this, that prolongs the fight by buffing his defence, still happen?"

That could absolutely get him or someone else killed, but I don't think it would be faithful to the character to have him not do something that then gets someone killed because he couldn't be fucked, for example. He's too smart. He realises exactly what the consequences of not doing the job right could be. It's a pain in the butt but he'll still do it.

Also, not getting promoted would be a reward for Shikamaru lol. He's the type of guy that would be happy with the job with the least responsibility possible. But when he is promoted he forces himself to rise to the task and do the job properly, which is why he gets promoted."
