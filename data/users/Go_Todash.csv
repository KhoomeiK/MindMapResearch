mildlycreepy,ff1hf00,t1_ff1fo0n,1579479268.0,"My mother had a great uncle who had married sisters, one after the other had died.  There was always suspicion that sister 2 had killed sister 1 out of jealousy.  She was known for having been ""not right"".  After great uncle and great aunt 2 passed away, her wedding ring passed to my mother's family.  Thereafter they began to experience a run of bad luck.  And so, one afternoon, my grandmother was driving out in the country with my mother (a child at the time), and stopped beside a likely field where the ring was tossed away.  My grandmother believed that the ring was cursed and swore my mother to never speak of what happened.  I guess she kept the secret for about 60 years before she told me about it."

therewasanattempt,fevfqlz,t1_feswtuk,1579396896.0,"I think there are really two kinds of ""offended"" and they get conflated as the same thing.  

One is where I actually mean to offend you, in which case I'm not likely to care about crying anyway; I'd be a jackass.  And the other is claiming offense as a tactic of manipulation.  The only real goal is *to get your way*. 

If someone is big and angry they might try intimidation to get their way.  If someone is well-spoken they might trying convincing someone, if they're charismatic they might use charm to manipulate, and so on and so forth.

But what if you have none of those things, but still feel compelled to control and influence what others say, do, and think?  Well, modern society, greatly abetted by a crass media, has provided a way:  ""acting offended"".

You can be loud, shrill, demanding: whatever it is that you've learned lets you *get your way*.  You can spot this person because they rarely try to convince, and they can never *be convinced* that they're wrong.  They just become louder, more shrill, more demanding.  This is the implied threat if they don't *get their way*: their behavior will get worse, until you give in."

This occurred to me way too late in life.  I always got to hear about how much my dad was a ""hard worker"".  He worked tons of over-time, for years and years.  And when I ended up working in the same place he did (airport) I got to see first-hand how he was actually showing up to work way earlier than he really needed to.

I see this a lot.  Guys who work lots of over time, and always show up early, and then you hear them make little comments about their spouse that make me think, ""oh, so that's why.""  I'm sure the money is nice, but growing up I didn't care about money nearly as much as I wished my dad would do something with me: show me a sport, teach me something, play a game, whatever.  But he never did, no matter how much I begged.

The final realization was that his ""vacations"" had the same quality: abandoning the rest of the family.  Over the years his vacation time was more and more eaten up by his hobby: hunting in the woods.  For deer or whatever, who gives a shit.  The point was it allowed him to avoid my mother, just like all that extra time spent at work.  The fact that I just got left alone with a crazy woman, either didn't occur to him, or he just didn't care.  No one cared.

My insane mother ruined my life, but my father *chose* to be a self-centered asshole."
todayilearned,fdq9egx,t1_fdpq268,1578660126.0,"We have stuff come open all the time.  People have a bizarre idea of how their luggage gets moved, like it floats individually on a fluffy white cloud, rather than on a system of mechanized belts and placed into a tiny, cramped bin stacked up with everyone else's heavy stuff like bowling balls, golf bags and tool boxes.  Plus, turbulence moves stuff.  So your bags containing breakables, like wine bottles and perfume in glass containers, which no one ever seems to think should be surrounded by cushioning like a towel or something, gets placed right next to everyone else's belongings. 

I've always thought they should place pictures of the bins, on like a poster or something, right up front where you check in, so people could see what a bag bin is like.

As for what the bag check agents *allow*, I have no say and less clue.  The only thing they seem to care about is weight and items strictly prohibited (mostly anything that might contain or leak gas).  Technically there is a weight limit, but a lot of the obviously too-heavy bags have a weight that is mysteriously marked down as exactly the limit amount.

I've loaded and unloaded the following: television sets, bicycles, a chandelier, moose antlers (wrapped and still bleeding), several dozen sets of fire fighting equipment, whole compartments full of soldier gear including the heavy-ass armor, a large full-size wedding cake (!?), case after case of hunting rifles going to Africa (gotta blast some of Mother Nature), and animals heading to a zoo (largest: giant anteater, they're really big).

I've seen bags making noise (radios or shavers), bags vibrating (yes), and once a bag smoking (some camper had stacked packets of hand warmers in between their clothing and it was starting to smolder, I guess the weight activated them).

The largest bag I remember was a giant suitcase going to San Salvador that was too heavy for any one person to move.  The two ladies on my pier thought they could drag it together but it came open and out rolled about a hundred bottles of water.  Why not just take a water filter?

Anyway, for anyone interested here are some tips: anything with batteries - *remove* the batteries.  If you have glass bottles - wrap them in something or at least place them toward the center of your suitcase (imagine all the above stuff I mentioned packed into the same bin with your bag).  And *don't over pack* - seriously, so many people shove too much into their bag and the cheap plastic zippers can't hold it all in.  There's nothing we can do about it, and we don't enjoy picking up your underwear up off the ramp any more than you enjoy having your stuff jammed back in and flopping about.  You are not saving money, you are just ruining a bag.  Because you managed to get it shut at home means little once its in a turbulence wracked tight spot next to your fellow 100 passengers bags - all of whom are going to a bowling tournament (it happens)."

This explains a lot of conservative behavior.  I've experienced it myself before I learned to face unpleasant truths about myself.  And I've seen it in my own mother.  I've lost hope for her, as she always chooses a comforting feeling over an uncomfortable fact.

Insecure people try to build themselves up by tearing others down.  Truly happy people, or at least well-adjusted people, don't do this.  The only thing they want for others is for *them* to feel the same things, because they understand their value.  They have no need to compensate.

My theory is that it stems from an error in reasoning.  For the vast majority of things in life, we know their value by comparing and contrasting.  This mug is larger than that cup.  My shirt is more purple than blue.  Employee Joe is faster at his job than employee Roger.  It is warmer inside my house than outside.  Etc., etc.

The problem is when you start applying this reasoning to whole swaths of your fellow human beings.  Because people have feelings, and they matter.  Other people are not emotional and verbal punching bags for you to lay into every time your ego needs to be stroked.  

The moment you start seeing others as dumb, evil, worthless, whatever ... just so that you can feel like you are the opposite, then you have distanced yourself from your own humanity.  You have reduced your own capacity for compassion and empathy and understanding - just for some fleeting, fake boost to your weak self-esteem.

And it doesn't even work.  You can tell because no real progress is made; there is no end-point.  There will never be a day where someone says, ""You know, I've been insulting and critical and hateful long enough that I now feel pretty good about myself.  Tomorrow, I stop being awful to people.""  That doesn't happen, because it can't happen.

Trying to build a sense of self at the expense of other people is like building your home in the middle of a swamp.  You can keep desperately trying to slap new layers on top, but without a better foundation you will never stop sinking back into the muck."

As for seeing specific numbers, in game you can list the name of any power in brackets [], like this: [Rend Armor] and it makes a clicky link to that power's description. 

Beyond that, there's not much you can do other than just playing the power set, as it was a set that was built just before the game ended and so there was little discussion or information collected about it.
