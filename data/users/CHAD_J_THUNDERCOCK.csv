You dont need kill 63 of their civilians. Just blow up one of their facilities or take out a leader. Tit for Tat maxisimises peace and cooperation in Iterative Prisonners dilemma. Its ethical and moral to hit back."
worldnews,fdljr8e,t1_fdl9i0m,1578525593.0,"I think a missile killing ~63 Iranian troops would be appropriate Tit-For-Tat. Tit-For-Tat maxismises peace and long term cooperation in Iterative Prisonner's Dilemma. And killing military is more ethical than killing civilians, while also more effective.

And if thats too much to ask: Take out the source of the surface to air missile - just that facility - to aid and incentiveness Iran to not make the mistake again.

And if thats too much to ask: do what Trump did a few years back (was it to Syria) when he destroyed some facility with no (or was it 1?) military fatalities."
worldnews,fdljevy,t1_fdlabtn,1578525341.0,Why is everyone saying it was likely an accident? WTF. Its 2020 - I can literally view all the passenger jets in the air on https://www.flightradar24.com yet the Iran military doesn't have access to this intel?!
worldnews,fdlic5r,t1_fdleqrk,1578524652.0,"No, they paid US$131.8 million which is $532,000 per passenger. Using an inflation calculator that is equivalent to **$1,169 Million per passenger** today"
worldnews,fdlhv6e,t1_fdlces1,1578524355.0,We don't need 50 years. It was intentionally shot down. I cant believe people are here claiming you can mistake a passenger jet for a missile.
Nootropics,fdlg2rv,t1_fdkhn1i,1578523258.0,"Or just eat tinned sardines! Same cost per gram Omega 3, good protein (20g), and one of the only real good dietary sources of calcium (perhaps the only nondairy source, most sources suck). And if you get them in tomato concentrate then it actually counts as 1 of your 5 a day (20g of tomato concentrate counts, whereas usually you need 80g of a fruit/veg). They are a great way to get protein if you are dieting or lifting and concerned about some of the negatives of red meat. And they last for ages in the tin so you can both buy in bulk and carry some to use for snacks.

Simply amazing, the best diet lifehack I know of. I try to eat 1 (120g) tin a day and am not far off. When I consistently eat them people start to ask how is my skin so nice. And when I dont eat them people dont mention my skin. You can safely eat 5 tins a day before you need to worry about mercury."

I've noticed that egg increases mortality rate way more than red meat."
MarioKartTour,fcqo1yp,t1_fcqmrxb,1577889372.0,The xX points boost seems relatively inconsequential. Glad you find that so hilarious though!
MarioKartTour,fcqlgoe,t1_fcq4rza,1577888104.0,That's only true for some levels. It's true for level 2 Vs 1. It's less true for level 3 Vs 2. It's true again for level 4 Vs 3. Because the frenzy % only goes up every 2 levels.
