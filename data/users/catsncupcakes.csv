AskVegans,ffhoikn,t1_ffgtfno,1579945455.0,"Thing is it's not possible to survive on grains alone. Humans need a more varied diet.

If it were possible to live in grains alone, we would be biologically different. There are loads of animals who eat the same things over and over. You ever see a cow go kill a rabbit because it was bored of eating grass? 

So it's impossible to give an answer because if we had evolved to only need one food source, we have no idea if humans would still have a concept of sensory specific satiety."
dogs,ffgjuy7,t1_ffghmai,1579907902.0,"It's kind of the opposite in the UK. They are allowed off lead anywhere except by roads or in spaces covered by a protection order. So for example, there's a public park near me which has a public spaces protection order where you have to leash up in the main areas of the park (where the cafe and playgrounds are) during April-Sept between 10am and 6pm. 

Responsible owners generally follow the etiquette of don't let an unleashed dog go up to a leashed dog, but there are always some dickheads. 

On the flip side, we don't have any of the 'dog parks' I see referred to on here all the time. My dog loves to play with other dogs so I would love to have something like that!"

Advice,ffeomfv,t3_et01eb,1579857610.0,"I used to work in a rescue shelter and moving house and being unable to find rented accommodation that allowed pets was one of the most common reasons we got for wanting to re-home an animal. It won't just 'limit' your options, there's a very real possibility that you will not be able to find anywhere and you will not be able to keep the dog. This is going to be an even bigger issue if you move regularly - not to mention that I don't think moving regularly will be good for the dog.

Have you owned a dog before? They're a LOT of work. You don't get a day off, especially if you haven't got a partner to help. You couldn't sleep last night and wake up super tired, desperate to spend just a little longer in bed? Tough shit, dog needs his morning walk. You're feeling like death because you've got the flu? Tough shit, dog still needs walking.

Financially have you budgeted for food, treats, toys, chews... A puppy will need lots of treats for training. You might have a dog that loves to chew and you'll spend a lot of money buying edible chews or replacing toys that only last 10 minutes. Then there's vet bills, insurance, boarding/kennels if you ever want more than a few hours off. It's really not cheap.

Dogs live over a decade, say 12-16 years depending on breed. Can you say for sure that you'll be able to look after him for the next decade? You'll always be able to afford him and prioritize him? Two other top reasons for rehoming are having children and change in work circumstances.

I'm going in a bit hard here because I've been on the receiving end of so many pups and dogs who's owners understood that a dog isn't for Christmas, but forgot about the a dog is for life bit. But they are AMAZING. I love my boy so much and would do anything for him. No matter how sad I feel, seeing his waggy tail and happy tippy taps cheers me up. He's just a bundle of love and happiness I can't imagine life without, he's worth all the effort we've had to put in. I completely understand why you would want one I really do. But I'd look into fostering or borrow my doggy or something to start with to get a feel for whether it is something you can really commit to on your own."

AmItheAsshole,fezja9o,t3_equynb,1579457933.0,"Being disabled myself, I came in here with hella wrath ready to tear you a new one... But no, NTA at all.

The chair was specifically bought for the dog because she is also disabled and has accidents which can be contained to that one piece of furniture, and you gave her another option to sit but she was being fussy. Ridiculously so - who even wants to sit on the designated piss chair?!?! 

If you had a healthy dog you were letting have the only seat instead of a disabled person it would be different, but there's serious mitigating factors here."

weddingshaming,feev17s,t1_feerz1s,1579041818.0,"They're both putting 10k into the wedding pot. Most things sorted with a fair bit of money left over, she wants to buy a $950 Wedding dress. He says that is a ridiculous amount of money and she can get the same thing for $50-100 on wish. He also thinks it's ridiculous that she wants her dress to be 'specially fitted'.

If you aren't familiar with wish it is an online market place known for low quality and hideously misleading product photos. 

She argues it's her money, he argues it's not because they are getting married so all the money is joint. Her parents offer to pay for it but he has an issue with that too. Whole thing escalated, she says she's rethinking the wedding given his reaction to the whole situation, he called her a toddler, she walked out to her parents.

He posts on AITA. Everyone and their mother is telling him he's an asshole, but OP refuses to accept his judgement and just doubles down on $950 being ridiculous for a wedding dress (spoiler alert if you're unmarried, it's not). 

The fiance actually has Reddit and 'some how' (because this isn't an obviously unique, specific situation that would be instantly recognisable regardless of username)  figures out that the throwaway account is her fiance. More arguing.

Commenters are now addressing her directly, asking her whether he always disregards her opinion, calls her name's when she doesn't agree with him, tries to control her purchases etc... OP is now blaming all relationship problems on AITA and the commenters, as if she didn't walk out on him before he made the post.

OP is now apparently drunk on whiskey and unable to type particularly well, still convinced he's in the right and is now banned from AITA for not accepting his judgement.

I think that's everything...

EDIT: just for fun, here's a message he sent to one of the commenters who called him out on his behaviour: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/iLeiyT0"
AmItheAsshole,feernam,t1_fe9zbsv,1579039743.0,"Even outside LA... I'm in the UK and I've been to a wedding with a household name in attendance. I wouldn't go as far as no one cares, but no one made a big deal out of it - people have these things called manners, which stop them from going celeb crazy at someone's wedding! We're adults at a wedding, not teenage girls at a boyzone concert. If anything you semi avoid them because you don't want them to think you're giving them special attention.

I also don't get the whole giving a blank plus one to someone who's single. Currently in the depths of wedding planning myself and if a friend or relative hasn't been with their partner long enough for me to even know their name, I'm not paying for a £60 meal plus booze for them."

dogs,fdk5zi5,t1_fdk5f5z,1578496847.0,"Of course they aren't the same, doesn't mean that pets shouldn't have legal protection against homelessness and the only reason I've ever heard cited is damage to property, which is BS, because there are plenty of things that are allowed which cause plenty of damage."
dogs,fdk05w7,t1_fdjzbq2,1578492737.0,"But it should be IMHO. Why is it that you cannot be discriminated against for having kids - who are just as capable of destruction of property, but you can be discriminated against for having a pet? 

This would drastically reduce the demand on animal rescues and result in fewer pets being given up. If the animal does no damage to the property, or the owners pay to cover any damages done, why shouldn't they be allowed to live there?"
cfs,fdjk43d,t3_elj2mw,1578474581.0,"My occupational therapist refers to GET as graded exposure therapy, and in my opinion has a much better idea on how to do it. She totally acknowledges the issues with GET and studies on it and has adapted it to what works for her patients. For one (very important) thing, she says exposure rather than exercise - i.e. ANYTHING you might be struggling with. So reading a book, washing, sitting up, being awake, all of it counts.

The first step is to 'establish a baseline', so find a place where you are comfortable. This is probably the hardest part as for me it meant giving up work which I was reluctant to do. So after over a year, I'm still trying to get to a place where I just feel okay, so I haven't even started looking at increasing anything yet. And that's really important, some people might be too severe to find a baseline and if that's the case, you shouldn't start increasing.

It sounds like this could be hard for you if you're different everyday - is that because you are in a boom and bust cycle or does activity definitely not have an impact? Have you done long term activity diaries? I know they are a pain but they can be really helpful in spotting what triggers you.

Once you've spent enough time at baseline to ensure its a good place, start increasing by 10%. So if you normally read for 5 minutes, try reading for 5 and a half minutes. If it causes a crash, stop. Go back to baseline. Wait till you are sure you're recovered then try 5% this time. Again, any time an increase causes a crash, go back to baseline. If you do the increase without punishment, stick at it for a month, then try another 10%. Again, any crashes or relapses, go back to baseline. Focus on one activity at a time.

It's also important to recognise that you may still have limits. You might be able to work up to 10 minutes of reading, and maybe you just can't go further than that. That's okay. Everyone is different. It's just about trying to get you to the best place you can be in. That might be where you are now, it won't work for everyone, but personally I'd like to see if I can do just a little more.

I guess her model is really more about gently finding your limits rather than pushing past them.

It's definitely true that if you don't use your muscles they will 'waste away' somewhat. Unfortunately that's going to be somewhat unavoidable. I used to be very active and I hate how unfit I am (both in terms of strength and cardio) now. I get out of breath very quickly because I never exert myself because of CFS.

Personally I find yoga quite good. You can do it at home, from an app. Some positions are absolutely too challenging but the ones that are more like stretching I find good. I do think staying completely still (in my case) does make me feel even worse, so I try to move a little/stretch as often as I can. But again, only as much as YOU as an individual can manage."

puppy101,fdgb6u8,t3_el12fe,1578388181.0,"We had the same with ours... But him in a pen and he eats the carpet, put him in his crate he eats the bed/puppy pads/crate bars. Take him out to toilet he eats the grass, mud or berries on the ground. Give him a toy, he shreds it and eats it. I never thought it could be so utterly difficult to keep an animal alive!! 

His 'separation related behaviours' were so bad that I couldn't even go to the loo or make a cup of tea without him. Hell, I couldn't not look at him without him whining.

Just keep it up with ignoring unwanted behaviour and rewarding good behaviour. Slowly slowly build up being alone, teach the drop and off commands, and know that it does get better.

Ours was so bad there were many conversations about rehoming, but we stuck it out and now we have the most perfect dog in the world! He still shreds things, but doesn't eat them, which is fine. He's fine being left alone, he still eats the odd bit of poo but not very often. His stomach is a lot more resilient too, so he doesn't get the runs everytime he has even the smallest morsel of something he shouldn't have had.

Just keep reminding yourself that YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB. It's just really hard, but it will get easier. IMHO the harder it is, the more likely you are to end up with a good pup because you aren't taking shortcuts - at least that's what we told ourselves! It will get better and you will end up loving him more than you thought possible!"

I have chronic fatigue and having the dog does give me a reason to get out of bed in the morning and get out the house. It means I'm not alone at home all day and he has just brought so much joy and love into my life.

But on the bad days I can't just skip walking him. And even with my scooter the walks can take a toll. I'd say only get one if you have someone to share the responsibility with and make sure to get a low energy dog - definitely rescue an adult dog so you know what you are getting. A puppy will absolutely be too much to handle."
