AskReddit,ff9fpyz,t3_esbdmy,1579712039.0,That Sheild has as much trouble getting everyone onto the same WebEx as everyone else does.
sysadmin,ff86f55,t3_eru7nl,1579667296.0,How are they maintaining HIPAA compliance if they are discussing medical issues via email? That's a terrible idea.
atheism,feztei2,t3_equf1z,1579461416.0,Amen!
DataHoarder,fezrbpb,t1_fewji4s,1579460662.0,Who down voted this? Does no one read the actual reddit rules for voting?
DataHoarder,fezqlwp,t1_fewmpmw,1579460411.0,"That's interesting. I believe you, but could you be grandfathered? The only reason I have not subscribed is because their page very clearly states 1TB if less than 5 users, and I did not want to pay $60 per month for unlimited storage

DataHoarder,fewji4s,t1_few3qjq,1579411884.0,The $12 plan only gets 1TB of storage unless you have 5 or more users.

beta,fermsqz,t1_fepv8ic,1579355899.0,You nailed it. That timer tends to turn reddit into the worst form of echo chamber.
Veterans,felzkwc,t1_felysda,1579235068.0,"Really good insurance will usually pay a portion, but a pair of good hearing aids can be upwards of $6k, and the VA generally provides really good ones"

DataHoarder,fe2bbam,t1_fe0cved,1578836474.0,"Well, only used in an emergency. If we're so worried about them we are buying specialty tools to stamp them on metal, why not? My point is, just print them on paper. If you live long enough to need the codes and the paper has deteriorated so badly it's unusable, just count yourself as lucky to be so aged."
DataHoarder,fe05k9y,t1_fdzwicr,1578803592.0,For all of that he could just tattoo the codes on himself.

Parenting,fdqemk4,t3_emjfve,1578664672.0,"All the time. I'm a dad, I take my boys to school in the morning, and then when I get home in the evening I value the time I have with them until their bed time (8 & 9 pm), but after 9, I need a few hours for myself to decompress from taking care of them and work. I think it's natural and healthy. The best tip I have is to have your husband put down the controller and step up and do his part. When I come home from work, I know that I am ""on"" for parenting duty until their bedtime. Playing video games at 4pm as a father is bullshit. He won't get this time back."

NextCloud,fconmlq,t3_ei9rag,1577836754.0,I think the reason hierarchal directory structure remains popular is because it's easier for the average person to understand. So many people don't get the whole idea of meta data.
