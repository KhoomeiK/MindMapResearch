So what did 12 year old me your into the address bar when looking for cute pictures of tigers? www.animalpics.com. No clue if it still exists.

badwomensanatomy,fcvvnzy,t1_fcva1dl,1578011141.0,"When we factor in the size of the animal and the overall percentage of body mass that is found in the brain... Yes. Humans have a massive prefrontal cortex which is absent in animals. It controls things such as impulses and higher order reasoning skills. Yes, elephants have larger brains than humans. But proportionally, human brains take up more human mass than elephant brains take up in the elephant."
badwomensanatomy,fcv5ejm,t1_fcv49la,1577995004.0,This makes sense as well.
badwomensanatomy,fcv2gg3,t1_fcv1mcn,1577993264.0,Correct. The human brain is more complex due to the prefrontal cortex which animals do not have. Animals in the wild need to be able to walk and run shortly after birth for survival. Humans don't have that concern. So we can take our time developing while our parents care for our every need.

badwomensanatomy,fcud6b6,t3_eiz84p,1577978189.0,"Human skulls are also larger relative to their size than animal skulls. Something something prefrontal cortex and larger brains. This explains why human babies are born so helpless as compared to other animals... Our brains and skulls are so large, that if they were to fully develop in utero, the human pelvis could not accommodate the birth due to the enormous size. Animals are born with their brains more developed, and are nowhere near as helpless in the hours after birth.

I had one who would constantly run away from any adult telling him to do something, and would punch adults in the face and jump to spit in their eyes when they got close. I had a 4 year old scream at me that he hates his life and does t want to be here anymore. As for what happens with them...

The only people obligated to get first aid are people who work with very young children, hospital staff, and paramedics (essentially, anyone with a job where they may need it). The laws for driving depend on where in Canada you are. For me, I took my written test (just knowledge of the laws and road signs) when I was 16. Once you pass that, you are legally allowed to drive with a licensed adult beside you. A year later, you take a driving test and you can drive on your own. That's it. We don't even have laws about calling ambulances or the police, although an overwhelming majority of people do because it's the right thing to do."
