I mean steam would only get 15% instead of the usual 30 but on an installbase that mostly wont have even access to steam otherwise. 15% is better than 0%. That being said im not sure if steam would do that. EGS however could be very interested in something like this. Its another way to put the EGS store out there besides buying exclusives.

Gamepass and PSNow are the pretty much the only thing you could consider greatvalue in terms of games on consoles and they are both on PC too, and one of them is even cheaper in PC.

Can you upgrade it for cheap or dou you have to buy an X/Pro after a few years? What about every gen? Do you upgrade a thing or 2 or so you have to buy a whole box again? How many blu ray players do you need?  A gen also lasts like 7 years. How much does 7 years of xbox live or psnow cost? Hundreds of dollars right there. Games are more expensive despite your argument abour gamepass and psnow (which are also on PC btw). I only did the switch to PC in like 2015/16. Had an xbox one and ps4 this very gen. I have hundreds of games on PC already and i didnt spend as much on them as i did on xbox and ps4 this gen ALONE. Sure some are older titles but then again thats another benefit of PC. Backwards compatibility, and not just from a few years back and not just selected games. Essentially BC since ever.
