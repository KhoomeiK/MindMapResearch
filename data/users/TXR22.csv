startrek,ffem3xf,t3_esqaoa,1579853943.0,What a beautiful first episode. It feels crazy that we're finally exploring the post Next Gen era of Star Trek and I cannot wait.
evilbuildings,ffejtmi,t1_ffduxpy,1579850974.0,"Ahhh, nice and toasty"
evilbuildings,ffejs26,t1_ffdtllc,1579850921.0,"As the sun progresses in it's lifespan, it will eventually run out of hydrogen and helium to fuel its fusion reaction and will start fueling itself with the element iron. By this point the sun will have expanded to a point where it consumes Mercury and Venus. While I'm not sure if it will grow large enough to consume Earth, there will definitely be enough radiation hitting the planet that it will no longer be able to support life as we know it."
Showerthoughts,ffeg6z3,t1_ffefjwx,1579846765.0,"I suppose it's up to the reader's interpretation. I think the answer comes down to your own philosophical beliefs on the matter. I personally see him as a villain because he took the 'easy' way out in terms of preventing a world war, but that came at the expense of those millions of lives. 

That being said though, I can definitely see the other point of view on the matter. It's a very similar situation to the American government choosing to drop atomic bombs on Japan in order to force their surrender. 

Anyway philosophy aside, Watchmen is an incredibly thought provoking story and was on the forefront when it came to that 'gritty/realistic' style that many superhero films go for these days."
AskReddit,ffefjl2,t1_ffe77ub,1579846076.0,1 in 3 billion definitely doesn't sound right lol
AbsoluteUnits,ffef0t8,t1_ffe7nkl,1579845536.0,Sounds like some Dark Souls level shit where ringing the bell causes the ground to crack open and provide access to a new area
Showerthoughts,ffeekl7,t1_ffe25fw,1579845079.0,"He's a 'super hero' who comes to the conclusion that the only way to unite humanity (which when the story takes place is currently at the peak of the cold war and on the verge of a nuclear armageddon) is to stage a fake alien attack on the planet. Millions of innocent people are killed as a result of his actions, but he believes that their deaths are a necessary evil and that more lives will be saved as a result."
holdmycosmo,ffeeb6s,t1_ffe75vg,1579844819.0,"Edgy maybe, but why stupid?"
unpopularopinion,ffebe2m,t3_et3s82,1579842062.0,"I think context is important. For example, if you are trying to direct someone to the only Asian working in the building then I don't think there's anything wrong with pointing out that they're Asian, just as there's nothing wrong with pointing out that that someone is white if the roles were reversed.

But if the situation were something more personal, like someone asked you to describe your new boyfriend and the first thing you lead in with is how he's black, that would definitely come across as a bit weird."
therewasanattempt,ffearj4,t3_et2ior,1579841504.0,"Depending on whether or not they all live in the same country, that's enough people to start a literal revolution lol"
assholedesign,ffe5mxc,t1_ffe3qx5,1579837333.0,"Or maybe someone else gifted it to his son as a birthday present or something?

Stop looking for reasons to pick on OP."
videos,ffe4z4g,t1_ffe4fec,1579836835.0,"I'm in Australia, and either yesterday or the day before I got a push notification saying something along the lines of ""Man in Queensland hospitalised after returning from China, currently unknown if he's infected with the coronavirus"". 

It's honestly pretty ridiculous how much the media relies on fear mongering to increase the number of clicks their articles get..."
videos,ffe43cn,t1_ffd3pcj,1579836174.0,"It's because the internet allows us to watch events unfold in real time before we know all the facts. I've gotten 4 or 5 push notifications from news apps in the past 24 hours about the virus, so I can definitely see why people get worked into a panic."
Stellaris,ffe2vob,t1_ffe2mxv,1579835275.0,"Okay interesting, I have admittedly never played as a fanatical materialist (though I usually use the lower tier of materialist as my second civic) so I think I'll have to play around with it the next time I start a new game. Any other recommendations when designing a civilisation?"
dndmemes,ffe2mpr,t3_et0hc5,1579835089.0,I've admittedly never played DnD in my life but this subreddit is great
nintendo,ffdy44r,t1_ffdxsz6,1579831813.0,"Absolutely the story. I have nothing against the art style, but the whole ""teaching Mewtwo the power of friendship"" thing is just awful, and even as a kid I remember being let down by the way it ended."
Stellaris,ffdwwt5,t1_ffdty7a,1579830953.0,That was a really awesome read
Stellaris,ffdw9w8,t3_essv4z,1579830502.0,"As someone who has been slowly learning to play over the past couple of years, that was a very interesting read.

If you don't mind me asking, could you provide info on the civilisation you are playing as? I'm still trying to wrap my head around balancing custom civilisations properly and if you were able to win a game under those conditions then your civ must be pretty good, lol"
SquaredCircle,ffdug97,t1_ffaa378,1579829209.0,"The most offensive part about Charlotte dropping the title to Carmella was that it was so she could take some time off to get her tits done. Not that there's necessarily wrong with that of course, but giving her the win before she took a bunch of time off was just ridiculous."
SquaredCircle,ffdty2g,t3_et1kgd,1579828850.0,Let the women wrestle the men instead of forcing them to compete in a sub division. Problem solved.
startrek,ffdtn3b,t3_esyaco,1579828635.0,">When I am in a dilemma I ask myself ""what would Picard do?"" and I always find and appropriate answer which is never harmful to anyone.

I think it's important to make the distinction between TV show Picard and ""THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO FOR THEM NOW! SO LET'S MOW THEM DOWN WITH A MACHINE GUN!"" movie Picard."
teenagers,ffdt1us,t3_et0g04,1579828210.0,Posting photos of yourself crying on the internet for attention is honestly pretty pathetic.
