That's actually not true. Some farmers of cantaloupe were charged by the federal govt for the deaths of 33 people after their contaminated produce washing water introduced listeria into all of the farm's cantaloupe. https://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/26/colorado-cantaloupe-farmers-charged-by-federal-officials-in-fatal-listeria-outbreak/"
interestingasfuck,fffvzl7,t1_fffo612,1579893007.0,"I was just going to reference this! I think they found that the farmers were taking the rejected cantaloupe to a farm for the cows to eat, and the farm's truck would return with listeria/fecal matter on the wheels. The wheels would go into a puddle/some water created by the farm's fruit washing machine. Somehow this contaminated water got into the machine (maybe someone picked up a dirty cantaloupe in the water and chucked it into the fruit washer?) and contaminated all the cantaloupes.

So, washing melons is only as safe as the water they're being washed in. Melons and other fruits/veg have pores on the outside that will absorb pathogens."
