bipolar,fe1vkpc,t1_fdwrpa3,1578831379.0,🥰🥰❤️
bipolar,fdvvn1z,t1_fdolq0q,1578752061.0,It’s a curse lol especially when I went down the Wish rabbit hole 😂
bipolar,fdvvjfl,t1_fdtnhxv,1578752007.0,Oh no! What happened? Are you okay? *virtual hug*
bipolar,fdo9hqw,t1_fdnphvb,1578601209.0,"Yeah! I always felt when people asked “how are you?” They don’t want a real answer, they want the PC answer. I recently became a stay at home mom so I fed you on that. In the past month I have started soooo many art projects that I just don’t have the motivation for a lot of the time so my house is looking a little weird right now 😂 we were also looking into getting a house (we still live in our first, pre-baby apartment and it’s getting cramped) and somehow I went from looking at houses 30 minutes or so from where I live (in Florida) to looking at houses in Canada and looking up the immigration process 😂😂"
bipolar,fdo8y6r,t1_fdnz4na,1578600938.0,Hi friend! ❤️ How has your day been?
bipolar,fdnnfzs,t1_fdnl7y6,1578589435.0,I’m the same! Except I have successfully managed to push away everyone so my circle is so small it’s almost non existent 🤦🏻‍♀️
bipolar,fdnn9e9,t1_fdnbyr7,1578589327.0,"Is it bad that I don’t mind being manic? It gives me a surge of energy, and it makes it soooo much easier to be out in public than when I go through depressive episodes. Also, depressive episodes trigger my ptsd so that kind of sucks, but I manage it like 80% of the time"
bipolar,fdnn4h5,t1_fdn923r,1578589246.0,Saaaaaame! I don’t have friends that I talk to regularly (thanks to depressive episodes) so everything I don’t say just tries to come out at once lol
bipolar,fdgnyce,t1_fdgl9uh,1578403570.0,"I used to be on Xanax but I developed a nasty addiction to it, next month is actually 5 years of sobriety for me. I just honestly don’t trust myself with pills readily available. I have some coping mechanisms I have developed for my anxiety, I just have problems trusting people and opening up, I think it would be easier to do behind a screen. Or at least I’d like to try. Another problem with talk therapy is that if I’m going through a manic period I’ll feel like I’m all good and will end up skipping appointments. Talk space is good but if you want to talk to a professional it’s expensive 😔 I’ll try reaching out to my insurance company though, thank you"

beyondthebump,fb90zdj,t3_ebzhxp,1576626618.0,"My kid is a year and a half, I promise it’s only temporary. In the early stages my husband and I would take shifts, so if the baby woke up between 12-4 am I would tend to him, if he woke up between 4-8 am my husband would get him, that way we would both get to sleep. Hang in there, mama."
