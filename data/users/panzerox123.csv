They have invested a lot into the infrastructure of the airport, but have spent nothing on keeping it maintained. the carpeted floors are dirty and theres a little trash here and there. Almost never any place to sit. They have exacly 4 benches outside the airport, and because I reached kind of early, I had to stand outside for 2 hours unless I bought something (I'm vegetarian so I already cannot eat most food there).

&#x200B;

None of them there know how to handle an airport. Immigration queue took over 1.5 hours. And the queue for green channel took another half an hour. Despite the line being kind of short (there were 4 lines merging into one).

While going back, they changed check in counters for our flight without changing the information on the board. The check in was already one hour late. There were 2 planes boarding from the same gate I was supposed to go to, and neither were my flight. And they finally changed the gate on the information board 5 minutes before boarding."
