ArtBuddy,feiw8pl,t3_epb350,1579148914.0,Beautiful! I'd love an art buddy. I mainly do graphite but I have a nice set of watercolors that are collecting dust.
AskReddit,fe80ww8,t1_fe7zndj,1578921130.0,Well shit. I hope there's something better they can give you? Your physical health comes first but I wish your mental health didn't need to be sacrificed.
CrappyDesign,fe7zghm,t1_fe7o7hp,1578920832.0,"I love it, I gave up social media all together about a year ago because of all the negativity. It was so easy to start a fight with someone you don't know and for no reason. This is the first time I've been on reddit and it's rather refreshing to see all the silly banters that happen."
AskReddit,fe7yoxc,t1_fe7wqro,1578920548.0,I didn't know those caused changes in emotions! Will they pass? Or is is something you'd have to get antidepressants for?
AskReddit,fe7xyjo,t3_eo3khv,1578920410.0,"No. I have the flu and my boyfriend told me 2 weeks ago that the reason he paid for 3 different tinder subscriptions is because he is a sociopath and enjoys toying with random women. Oh, but I'm ""different"". If course. He would *never* toy with my mind. I have a job and my damn health to be worried about without this bullshit piled on top of it all."
AskReddit,fe7t7ie,t3_eo1bgd,1578919010.0,"Step 1: watch them become paranoid when you're around their phone.

Step 2: become paranoid yourself and check their phone.

Step 2.4: find three different paid subscriptions to tinder, an email full of dating sites, his ex on playstation, and a partridge in a pear tree.

Step 3: hide the fact that you know all of this for an entire week because Christmas is right around the corner and nothing but shit ever befalls you. You need any bit of happiness you can get.

Step 4: watch him sleep. 

Step 5: give in and confront him on Christmas day  because how much worse can your life really get. 

Step 6: listen to him give excuses that you fully believe. He fully believes he's a sociopath, he doesn't want to fuck those other women, he just enjoys toying with their emotions. Playing games with their minds. Leading them on to fill that sickly dark hole in his chest.

Step 7: you're a masochist and a naive being so you stay with him, teach yourself to have rough, desperate sex in an attempt to fix everything. 

Step 8: wonder for the rest of your life if your brand new bike and brand new coat were stolen or if the sociopath gave them to some homeless person in an attempt to trap you."
