This person took advantage of the trans movement to coerce someone into sex and then didn't take no for an answer. In my book that's rape and should be treated as much. 

This disgusting individual should not be allowed to hide behind being trans and use that as an excuse to get what they want. No means no regardless of what's between your legs or what you identify as.

OP this is in NO WAY your fault."

AmItheAsshole,fc64jyv,t1_fc63wmu,1577472115.0,"Ok, but OP literally stated it was a handjob, regardless of whether it was lazy, drunken, peer pressure etc. The fingering argument is totally valid and it baffles me people are trying to justify any of this, but let's mix it up.

Imagine OPs SO lazily fingered a stripper while  drunk and his mates are goading him on, that's totally fine right, because he wasnt into it. Therefore it doesn't count, right?

Sorry but your argument of ""OP didn't want it"" is totally invalid, noone forced OP, this was a completely intentional action on OPs behalf."
