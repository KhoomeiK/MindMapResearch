Which makes it even more jarring because there's no reason for the way he acts, as you said.  


Honestly the whole ""cowards run, I win"" thing could still work. Before I heard about the mandate my theory was that Shadow, while placing the blame on Sonic outwardly, was inwardly blaming himself. Because he went along with Sonic and gave Eggman a second chance, he felt responsible for the situation, and wanted to make things right. But then I heard about the mandate and the fact that Ian originally didn't want to write the scene that way."
SonicTheHedgehog,fcn6cnb,t1_fclxbax,1577804439.0,"Well I compare him to that Vegeta because Vegeta goes from wanting to defeat Frieza no matter what (even teaming up with Gohan and Krillan and asking Goku to finish the job when he fails) to just wanting to prove how big his Super Saiyan dick is. Pretty much what current mandate Shadow is - went from a guy who wants to protect the world, sometimes through extreme measures, to ""Cowards run, I win!""

I've been replaying Heroes recently and I love some of the one-liners Shadow has that show his appreciation for the world around him, such as referring to Casino Park as a cool city, and commending the ""amazing feats of technology"" in Rail Canyon.  


EDIT: I suppose to be fair, current Shadow is more likely to kill a potential threat before it can become one (like how he wanted to kill Eggman/Mr. Tinker in IDW) whereas Vegeta would let Cell evolve to his Perfect Form just for a challenge."

SonicTheHedgehog,fcl4nik,t1_fcl0yyu,1577739722.0,"Another thing to note is Shadow kinda falls under the same trap in both SA2 and Shadow the Hedgehog. In SA2 he's so dedicated to his supposed promise with Maria he never stops to question it or how out of place it is, just accepts that it's what he must do. The result is he almost destroys the planet Maria loved. In Shadow, his obsession with learning his past reached the tipping point and became so strong it blinded him to what was happening in the present, almost costing humanity its future.  


By the end of Shadow he learns to let go of the past and focus on the future, and this comes full circle in '06 where he puts aside the past so he can work with GUN, and regardless of what fate has in store for him he won't give up protecting the planet Maria loved. At the end of the day, Shadow's whole story from SA2 to '06 is about accepting your past, but not letting it define you (Live and Learn and I Am), and '06 just flips it the other way where he accepts his future and doesn't let it effect his judgement.

SonicTheHedgehog,fcfipm5,t1_fcaxnal,1577630418.0,"Yeah, that's another thing that seems to commonly confuses people. The Commander was a child at the time of the raid so he was fed the exact same story everyone else was - that Gerald's experiment killed the research team and GUN were the heroes that saved the civillians onboard (minus Maria). To me it seems more than natural he would grow up to be a GUN Commander and fester a hatred for Shadow (who he knew to be that experiment)."
SonicTheHedgehog,fcaunwg,t3_egrif0,1577576956.0,"> The GUN commander's parents were killed on board the ARK so when he was  old enough he joined GUN and rose through the ranks to bring those  responsible to justice. This explains why Shadow agrees to work for them  in later games. 

I don't understand why this is such a complicated matter for people. Shadow joins GUN because he's let go of the past and is looking towards the future. The GUN that killed Maria and the researchers were the GUN of 50 years ago. The GUN of today are led by a man who wants to make things right after learning the truth, and are NOT the same people that carried out the awful acts. Yes there's probably tension but Shadow's determined to carry out his promise and protect the people of Earth, no matter what resources he has to use. He's not going to let the incident of 50 years ago blind him anymore (much of Shadow's game was actually him being so absorbed by his past that he failed to take note of the present until it was almost too late), and if GUN have allies and resources that can help to that end he'll use them.  


Also the GUN Commander's backstory you've posted literally IS his backstory. In his mind, the one responsible was Shadow - and what made him stand out more than any other citizen that ""survived"" the ""accident"" on the ARK was that he was the only one who actually SAW Shadow. Everybody else was just fed the story that ""Gerald's experiment killed the research team and Maria was caught up in it"", but the Commander had a face to put to that ""experiment"". That's why he was so determined to get his revenge. That's why, like Shadow, he was so absorbed by the past that he was blinded to the present. Shadow saved the world in SA2? Anyone else would give him the benefit of the doubt - like the president or the GUN soldier that question the Commander's orders to kill Shadow on sight - but the Commander ""knows"" that Shadow is a vicious killer and so it MUST have been a trick to fool everyone!  


Honestly Shadow and the Commander parrellal each other so well and it kinda goes unnoticed because people just choose to write off the story as ""edgy trash"" and not actually look at it constructively. Both are held captive by the past and the result is they both make poor judgements and terrible mistakes in the present."

Which makes it even more jarring because there's no reason for the way he acts, as you said.  


Honestly the whole ""cowards run, I win"" thing could still work. Before I heard about the mandate my theory was that Shadow, while placing the blame on Sonic outwardly, was inwardly blaming himself. Because he went along with Sonic and gave Eggman a second chance, he felt responsible for the situation, and wanted to make things right. But then I heard about the mandate and the fact that Ian originally didn't want to write the scene that way."
SonicTheHedgehog,fcn6cnb,t1_fclxbax,1577804439.0,"Well I compare him to that Vegeta because Vegeta goes from wanting to defeat Frieza no matter what (even teaming up with Gohan and Krillan and asking Goku to finish the job when he fails) to just wanting to prove how big his Super Saiyan dick is. Pretty much what current mandate Shadow is - went from a guy who wants to protect the world, sometimes through extreme measures, to ""Cowards run, I win!""

I've been replaying Heroes recently and I love some of the one-liners Shadow has that show his appreciation for the world around him, such as referring to Casino Park as a cool city, and commending the ""amazing feats of technology"" in Rail Canyon.  


EDIT: I suppose to be fair, current Shadow is more likely to kill a potential threat before it can become one (like how he wanted to kill Eggman/Mr. Tinker in IDW) whereas Vegeta would let Cell evolve to his Perfect Form just for a challenge."

SonicTheHedgehog,fcl4nik,t1_fcl0yyu,1577739722.0,"Another thing to note is Shadow kinda falls under the same trap in both SA2 and Shadow the Hedgehog. In SA2 he's so dedicated to his supposed promise with Maria he never stops to question it or how out of place it is, just accepts that it's what he must do. The result is he almost destroys the planet Maria loved. In Shadow, his obsession with learning his past reached the tipping point and became so strong it blinded him to what was happening in the present, almost costing humanity its future.  


By the end of Shadow he learns to let go of the past and focus on the future, and this comes full circle in '06 where he puts aside the past so he can work with GUN, and regardless of what fate has in store for him he won't give up protecting the planet Maria loved. At the end of the day, Shadow's whole story from SA2 to '06 is about accepting your past, but not letting it define you (Live and Learn and I Am), and '06 just flips it the other way where he accepts his future and doesn't let it effect his judgement.

SonicTheHedgehog,fcfipm5,t1_fcaxnal,1577630418.0,"Yeah, that's another thing that seems to commonly confuses people. The Commander was a child at the time of the raid so he was fed the exact same story everyone else was - that Gerald's experiment killed the research team and GUN were the heroes that saved the civillians onboard (minus Maria). To me it seems more than natural he would grow up to be a GUN Commander and fester a hatred for Shadow (who he knew to be that experiment)."
SonicTheHedgehog,fcaunwg,t3_egrif0,1577576956.0,"> The GUN commander's parents were killed on board the ARK so when he was  old enough he joined GUN and rose through the ranks to bring those  responsible to justice. This explains why Shadow agrees to work for them  in later games. 

I don't understand why this is such a complicated matter for people. Shadow joins GUN because he's let go of the past and is looking towards the future. The GUN that killed Maria and the researchers were the GUN of 50 years ago. The GUN of today are led by a man who wants to make things right after learning the truth, and are NOT the same people that carried out the awful acts. Yes there's probably tension but Shadow's determined to carry out his promise and protect the people of Earth, no matter what resources he has to use. He's not going to let the incident of 50 years ago blind him anymore (much of Shadow's game was actually him being so absorbed by his past that he failed to take note of the present until it was almost too late), and if GUN have allies and resources that can help to that end he'll use them.  


Also the GUN Commander's backstory you've posted literally IS his backstory. In his mind, the one responsible was Shadow - and what made him stand out more than any other citizen that ""survived"" the ""accident"" on the ARK was that he was the only one who actually SAW Shadow. Everybody else was just fed the story that ""Gerald's experiment killed the research team and Maria was caught up in it"", but the Commander had a face to put to that ""experiment"". That's why he was so determined to get his revenge. That's why, like Shadow, he was so absorbed by the past that he was blinded to the present. Shadow saved the world in SA2? Anyone else would give him the benefit of the doubt - like the president or the GUN soldier that question the Commander's orders to kill Shadow on sight - but the Commander ""knows"" that Shadow is a vicious killer and so it MUST have been a trick to fool everyone!  


Honestly Shadow and the Commander parrellal each other so well and it kinda goes unnoticed because people just choose to write off the story as ""edgy trash"" and not actually look at it constructively. Both are held captive by the past and the result is they both make poor judgements and terrible mistakes in the present."
