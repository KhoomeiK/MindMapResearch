Do not over feed her. Being that she is skinny you may want to feed her a lot, but they will over indulge and get sick. 

Secondly, pine pellets and a sifting litter box are the cheapest, most eco friendly, least smelly, and least messy way to go."

montgomery,ff01yt1,t3_elgtk9,1579464365.0,I use to live downtown and went to the market many of times. They said the owner was getting old and it would likely close when he passed. (No idea if thats true or not)
montgomery,fei0o4a,t1_fefsyxo,1579127728.0,"Forgive me for my lack of knowledge in the field, but this is for my honey. He loves a challenge and wanted to build a drone in his spare time because.. uhh.. well I guess he thought it would be fun.  Anyways, he would be interested in having someone in the area with a shared hobby that would be willing to help him as well when he had questions as he is new to all of the building a drone community. 

He has stumbled now in that he has to de solder a bridge joint, and would like some guidance in the best practice for this. YouTube has helped some, but still leaves some questions open. 

Below is a link to a photo of where he is stuck.

cookingforbeginners,fehg8ph,t3_ep3k0r,1579115906.0,"I would highly suggest getting an instapot. This will help you tremendously. Cooking is simple, but flavors are just as good as cooking on a stovetop. Plus you can simply hit soup, rice, etc and it will cook for you. I‚Äôm a huge fan. 

This is my favorite chicken noodle soup recipe with an instapot
