HumansBeingBros,fenm2fv,t3_eq2myk,1579287590.0,"From the article:

Russell had been calling Grand Rapids police the entire time the rescue was happening, but they couldn't provide immediate assistance because of several other dogs that had been rescued from the river that morning.

“I think 3 dogs were in the river that morning. They mentioned a husky and a pug. So they got several calls, rescued 2 dogs and thought they had it all taken care of. When I called the second time the operator said the dog was reported rescued so I just had to reaffirm that there was still 1 dog in the river,"" Russell said.

Ummm what’s up with that river and dogs?"

AmItheAsshole,fegsy4p,t1_fegglxn,1579101812.0,"I disagree with you completely. How does not shaving your head in support of a coworker translate to being asshole?  It’s not an all or nothing situation...he can simply offer support by being there for the person, or donating blood, or money to cancer research. A person shouldn’t be forced to do something just because everyone else is doing it. If anything his coworkers are TA simply by making OP feel terrible for not going along with everyone else."

niceguys,fcyzjvp,t1_fcyxd5n,1578090570.0,The kids these days like to say things like “I’m dead” or “dying” or “screaming” when they find something funny or unbelievable lol...when in actuality they’re just sitting there staring at their phone texting blandly
