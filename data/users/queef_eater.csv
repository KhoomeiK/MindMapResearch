AnimalsBeingBros,ff7xwub,t1_ff7w70a,1579660981.0,"Good point, but I highly doubt those are wild rats. Wild rats don't usually come in that variety of colours."
AnimalsBeingBros,ff7xmow,t1_ff7ulbt,1579660783.0,You can get hairless rats. They might not trigger your allergies.

somethingimade,ff5fcd3,t1_ff5b7mp,1579590423.0,Consider lighting around that mirror too. Putting on makeup with shadows across your face can be difficult
todayilearned,ff5f7uq,t1_ff5dq6l,1579590272.0,"Are you thinking of Alias Grace on netflix? This story reminded me somewhat of it, maybe this was part of the inspiration, but they are overall quite different stories."
relationship_advice,feokatj,t3_eq3h0c,1579301387.0,"Is it true?  
This is something you heard from a friend of the guy that supposedly had sex with her.  
There is a lot of reasons that this might be false, maybe the new partner said this to save face or pump himself up to his friend, maybe he thought your ex was still too close to you and it would cause a rift, maybe his friend thought it would be a funny prank to play on you....  
I think you should do her the courtesy of asking and see how she reacts.  
Teens, even at 18 and 19, have a way of exaggerating and are often thoughtlessly mean."
relationship_advice,fe6s0q5,t1_fe6ln6o,1578902664.0,"I like the sentiment, but it is poorly phrased. Adopted children are not extra special, especially when their siblings are biologically OPs. You don't ever want to make any child feel less special."
australia,fe6j192,t1_fe5y17y,1578892465.0,"Is there an inexpensive way to learn? Preferably online.  
I would love to learn, I had a deaf friend as a child and he taught me a lot, unfortunately I forgot most of it.  
I would love to see it as an elective language in aussie schools. It is an underated skill to have."
somethingimade,fdtygag,t3_en12lg,1578724299.0,I love those hanging chairs. Where are they from?

HumansBeingBros,fdjt6cy,t1_fdjixeu,1578486614.0,"Wires is our primary animal rescue group. They care for all species. They have agencies in large centres and volunteers in every town in every state and territory. Throughout this ordeal they have tirelessly worked to save as many animal lives as possible. Most of this won't be filmed and is therefore unlikely to be seen or acknowledged, but it is happening.  
You can help by donating funds or by crafting nests, pouches and wraps to help care for these animals."
HumansBeingBros,fdjsuw9,t1_fdjgvgs,1578486284.0,"Most organizations care for all animals, a few offer specialized care for individual species. These agencies are aware of each other and act together to give all the best chance of survival."
australia,fdcrqtv,t1_fdce2am,1578282440.0,"I own that movie, watched it once. For days after it haunted me, and still does often. 3specially in times like these. It is an amazing and impactful movie that I recommend to everyone, an Aussie masterpiece. But I don't know it I will ever watch it again."
australia,fdcrhvs,t1_fdcjf8e,1578282253.0,"There is #ozfireartauction on twitter. I am not sure who is organising it, but it is collective artists coming together to raise money."

castiron,fd41zcm,t3_ejzle2,1578163612.0,"I also have a glass topped stove. My cast iron has been used on it daily for years and there are no scratches. The only problem might be if you dropped your pan on the stove top.  
Maybe look at the manufacturers website or email them and ask them if your cast iron is safe to use on your model."
Showerthoughts,fd3agbh,t1_fczehdf,1578156364.0,"It didn't. Engrained is a variant of ingrained, which is derived from dyeing with grains. Etymology of words can be really weird sometimes."

australia,fc51k86,t1_fc4xkv7,1577438367.0,Doesn't hours of voluntary work already count towards fulfilling newstart obligations? It used to when I was on it years ago.
