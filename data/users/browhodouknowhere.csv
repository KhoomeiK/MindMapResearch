I love her with all my heart and grow each year we are together. Meaning, i learn not to criticize a cultural standpoint or purchasing decisions that aren’t part of my life. Likewise, my wife grows as a person and maintains her ethnic and cultural identity with a combination of personal development and different outlook than her family maintains. Different backgrounds can work, we just have to have empathy and listen without judgement when we hear things that don’t make sense to us."

PublicFreakout,feiyylf,t1_feiwx1l,1579151184.0,"I understand your hypothetical scenario, but this isn't the case. Banks offer products to people to make money. There is no incentive to the consumer other than a loss of property. Sure, measured payments over time seem ideal, but you really think this is something you are going to endorse because of your aforementioned hypothetical situation? I’m happy to entertain your plausible instance as a reason to use a reverse mortgage, but I’m not going to pretend people who seek these financial products are all single home owning 75 year olds."
