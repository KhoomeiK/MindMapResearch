Mike tomlin inherited a super bowl team. And he’s proven that he deserves to be In The Hall when he retires. 

I ultimately think Flores is just not a popular pick. They obviously don’t put coaches in the hall as much as players. And Flores is just not a exciting pick. Dungy is well respected by everyone. Jimmy Johnson has a huge personality. Cowher was a sound bite machine. Not to say they shouldn’t get in but Flores shoplifting have gone in well before them."

I don’t think Dungy did anything special with the colts. I think a lot of coaches would’ve gotten the same results if not better. Jim Caldwell also brought Indy to a super bowl. 

The cowboys dynasty wasn’t all because of Jimmy. He and Jerry built that team and they needed each other. Even though they hated each other. Jerry has a amazing eye for talent, but can’t run a team to save his life. He needed jimmy to run his team. 

The point is that Flores isn’t in for some unknown reason. Is it because they hate the Raiders? Is it because he’s Hispanic? Is it because he’s just not that popular?  Because as I’ve argued he compares very well with a lot of the coaches that are already in, if not better then some that are already in."

oaklandraiders,fe6emdy,t3_enpawz,1578888618.0,"There is a couple reasons why scrambling QBs is a gimmick. 

A scrambling can’t stand in the pocket and make a pass under pressure. Because there natural instinct is to scramble once the pass rush gets close. So they miss open receivers because they are “keeping the play alive” instead of standing in the pocket making the throw and taking the hit. 

Injury. Take Cam for example. He takes a extra 10–15 hits a game from running the ball. Add that with the 5 plus hits he takes from just being a QB that puts him close to 20 hits a game. That’s how many hits a average starting RB takes. Everyone knows that after a RB turns 30 the injury’s rack up and they don’t have the same talents and durability they once had. Once Cam runs the ball he isn’t afraid to punish the defenders, but it’s at the cost of his body and now it shows. He’ll probably never play a full season again. 

Russel Wilson and Aaron Rogers are the best at scrambling. Wilson isn’t prefect yet but he’s almost there. They only scramble to keep a dead play alive. They hardly run the ball and when they do they avoid contact. Obviously Rogers isn’t the scrambler he once was. Russel Wilson should be the bench mark for Lamar Jackson and Deshawn Watson. Your scrambling shouldn’t screw the plays design up. When you run you should always go out of bounds or slide. Never take a hit. Unless it’s to win the game."

nfl,fdmqkuo,t3_em0ge1,1578560896.0,"Beating the patriots isn’t hard. Most coaches fall for Belichicks traps. No coach is going to out wit belichick. 

Classic Belichick move. Letting a team run the ball and dare them to beat you passing. Belichick does this all the time. Mainly in big games. This trap always works against the “genius” coaches. 

He did it in the giants bills super bowl. Thurman Thomas has 15 carries for 135 yards. He knew the bills couldn’t help themselves and pass the ball. Thurman should ran the ball 15 more times. But The Bills and Jim Kelley had to prove they could pass the ball on his defense. And they got beat. 

He did it against rams for his first super bowl win. Marshall Faulk averaged 4.7 yards a carry that game. More then enough to keep running. For most of the game they where down 2 possessions. No reason to panic. But the great show on turf had to prove they could pass the ball to get back in the game.  

Undefeated season vs the colts. He knew they couldn’t stop manning. So he completely abandoned his run defense. There was points in the game he dropped 9 people into coverage. And manning still wouldn’t check down to the run. 

Same with his last sb win. The rams only ran the ball 18  times. I’m a game that was a one field goal game. The rams consistently tried to throw the ball even though the patriots where running a pass defense. But Mcvay has to prove he was a genius and out coach belichick. 

Now we get to the Titans. Belichick tried to bait Vrabel. But Vrabel being a player for Belichick for so long knew what was happening. Even Romo noticed that in the beginning of the game the patriots defense was playing to stop the pass and left the run game wide open. That was the bait. But Vrabel didn’t bite. So he took what Belichick was giving him and his team played a solid game. Nobody tried to out couch Belichick. They stuck to the game plan and coached a disciplined game."

FanTheories,fd7mnj4,t3_ek6bzi,1578206820.0,"This movie is truly one of the greatest all time. In any movie when a character makes a definitive statement the audience is conditioned to believe that statement is true no matter what is being said. For example the joker saying he doesn’t have a plan. When he clearly has a complicated plan throughout the entire movie. Everything he does is planned. So he’s obviously lying to Harvey to manipulate him. If he tells Harvey it was all part of some great scheme to kill Rachel then Harvey will just want the Joker dead. But if he tells him that he’s just some crazy guy and it was everyone else’s fault. That’s when Harvey realizes that it’s Jim’s fault for not listening to Harvey about the bad cops in his precinct. 

The evidence is through out the entire movie that the joker is a liar. He uses lies to manipulate everyone, including the audience.
