Rabbits,fct5qxf,t1_fct4jb3,1577933581.0,"Nothing crazy, I guess that’s what I’m trying to figure out.  Grass/Timothy hay, 1/4 cup pellets once a day and limited treats.  They go outside a lot in summer, not so much in winter (as we are in Michigan) to sorta free range graze our yard.  
  I am thinking about ? groomer or vet to have mats cut because I’m so afraid I’m going to hurt him but my husband doesn’t want to spend $.  Also threatened to invest in some clippers to just keep areas trimmed back but apprehensive especially if they need their back feet pads."
Rabbits,fct35ih,t1_fct11gd,1577931662.0,"I have a question about this with a bun who’s fur isn’t so crazy, but I have hella trouble with his butt, back feet’s, tail.  He has bad troubles with matted fur on feet tail and we are about once a wk having to give butt baths because it gets all stuck and nasty and he smells like an outhouse that you’d never in a million years want to visit...I try my hardest to keep this at a minimum because I don’t want to get him sick from having wet skin and try to cut mats off but am so worried I’m going to hurt him(I’m so very careful).  His sisters don’t have this trouble so I don’t think it’s diet related.  Any suggestions for this?"
