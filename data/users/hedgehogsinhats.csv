puer,feyn2t7,t1_feylubj,1579447805.0,"In literary criticism, purple prose is prose text that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself. Purple prose is characterized by the excessive use of adjectives, adverbs, and metaphors. (I copied that off wikipedia). I mean when I look at a vendors site for a puer tea and I see thing about thousand year old trees and how hard the vendor looked for it.... meh. As an example, from a vendor at random: 


> There are many Tuo PuErh tea on the market, in fact, the world is flooded with the stuff. So many (we would say 9 out of 10) are poorly made and have that distinctive fishy or dried squid aroma indicating mass production, poor ripening, no ageing or excessively wet storage. This smell demonstrates that the wrong kinds of moulds have developed and the stronger the smell the poorer the quality.

> We have searched far and wide for Tuo tea and this one is spectacular. We previously offered a big client favourite from 1998 and when we began running low we became a bit anxious that we could not find a match. However, I think we may have found one which is even more delicious! Produced in 1996 and aged for over 20 years in perfect dry storage in Yunnan to make a crazily silky tea with lots of matured, dry fruit and antique wood aromas with a fudge creaminess that is usually reserved for the top level ripe cakes. I am so happy that we have found such quality in a tuo shape and at a really affordable price.


I read that and like... okay. The vital info (1996, aged for 20 years) is buried in flowery sales language that adds nothing. But I get why they add it, it helps with sales. I just wish it would go away."

Individuals claiming to have Morgellons typically exhibit sores, which they believe “contain” some sort of fibrous material.[1][2] Morgellons is poorly characterized, but the general medical consensus is that it is a form of delusional parasitosis. The sores are typically the result of compulsive scratching, and the fibers, when analysed, were consistently found to have originated from clothings and other textiles.
