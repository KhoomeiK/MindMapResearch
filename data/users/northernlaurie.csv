CaminoDeSantiago,ffd4zsr,t3_esyt5o,1579813532.0,"I did the Norte in 2017 September and October.  I am a woman.

Clothing:  I started with: synthetic cheap hiking t shirt, cotton blend t-shirt, long Macabi skirt, convertible synthetic pants, leggings, fleece sweater, lightweight synthetic large scarf, good quality arcteryx jacket and trail runners for shoes.  I forgot a large brim hat.  

The cotton blend t-shirt lasted a week and I finally gave up and bought a cheap synthetic shirt-it took too long to dry.  I could have lived with it, but the 20euros for a cheap shirt were worth it.  I had trouble finding a T-shirt that because I was a size 14us at that time.  I bought a hat on day 1.

Glad I got trail runners not boots-there are a lot of compacted and paved surfaces and most hiking boots don’t have as much cushion as trail runners.  The trade off was ankle support, but I never missed that.

The scarf was very useful... it was a privacy partition, pillow case, back up towel, sheet, wrap skirt, extra layer for warmth and pretty thing for evening wear.

Rain coat and backpack rain cover or backpackers raincoat are essential.  It will rain buckets.  Like someone opened a fire hydrant and the rain is cold.

I wish I had a very thin light long sleeve shirt-my gortex jacket doesn’t have a liner and when it’s starts drying out my arms would get cold.  There were other times I wish I had something lighter than my fleece, but if I had to choose, I’d do the same.

Also, hiking socks.  Expensive but very definitely worth it.

Mostly didn’t book ahead, and always found a place to stay-but I was solo and looked pathetic so I often got the last space."
CampingGear,ff426j9,t3_ercpfl,1579553920.0,"Cold feet are tricky.  

My sister and I both end up with painfully cold feet when it is cold and we sit for more than about an hour.  They will not warm up without an outside source of heat, so putting down booties or heavy socks on after our feet are cold will leave us very uncomfortable.  When camping, we usually have a campfire or go for a walk before bedding down for the night, so we can avoid having cold feet before sleeping.

Otherwise, we need hot water bottles or we will use chemical based hand/foot warmers.  Be careful with hand warmers because many of them are not designed to be in a confined space and may not be appropriate for use in a sleeping bag.  If you use a water bottle, carry ziplocks or something else as a back up for leaks.  Don’t use anything that you aren’t absolutely confident it won’t leak.  And then don’t trust it.

I would not recommended anything combustion based for use when sleeping.  Almost all camping gear are synthetics that will perform badly if exposed to high heat-melting, smoking, burning-with a high likelihood of injury in a place that medical attention is hard to get."

And honestly you sound impressive for a 22 year old with exceptional management potential.  Not many people have the presence of mind and ability to express themselves well and work to create a better work environment-and it is better .  Likely more inclusive and potentially more constructive.

But a word of caution.  It can be extraordinarily tiring to constantly be managing other people’s emotions. Even if management takes the form of backing away.  It can also be isolating.  Try to find allies and friends at work and make sure you have support from at least one senior person.  If you don’t, be careful to measure your own well-being realistically and recognize if you are burning out.  If you have even one or two allies it can make a world of difference."
CaminoDeSantiago,fejxllw,t3_epi5id,1579188166.0,"I used Buen Camino and wise pilgrims apps for the Norte.

Apps are ok but I had problems with my phone battery so I didn’t have access on many days.

When I did have access. I could sort out locations of albergues that weren’t directly on the Camino and use GPS to find my way.

When I didn’t, I felt stressed because I didn’t know how much further to my destination.

On the Norte some stages are really long and there are no cafes and bars.  The guides help decide a few days in advance how to break up the distances and when to carry food versus buy.  Frances is more forgiving but I would still have something really simple for that purpose"
AskWomen,feizze6,t3_epajf6,1579152083.0,"I was holding a large map of the city, trying to figure out how to get back to a coffee shop where I’d left a package earlier in the day.  This random guy comes up and asks if I need directions, suggests I take the metro and offers to walk with me to the station, then asks to come with me to the shop, then offers to buy me dinner.

He proceeded to tell me the dirtiest most inappropriate jokes ever, explains he bought his cat a diamond and ruby necklace, and orders my meal for me.  It was so odd.  And somehow bizarrely endearing for its innocent awkwardness.

He was the first person I met in Montreal when I moved there.  He is still bizarrely endearing and completely clueless, but incredibly generous, honest and trustworthy.

And happily he buys me jewelry know, not just his cat."
ArchitecturePorn,feiv2hf,t1_fegvxqp,1579147996.0,"lol, yup.  First 5 years of my career were spent investigating, diagnosing and fixing building envelope issues in the Pacific Northwest.

Vapour barriers are still really important in this climate and their role in the premature failures we experienced is less significant than other factors, most notably exterior details that failed to adequately divert water away from the building.  This is not true of all climates-Other regions other problems.  Put a giant roof overhang on a building in a rainforest. And it will last longer.

“Moisture barrier” is used conventionally in my office to refer to the secondary drainage plane (eg building paper or Tyvek).  This is distinct from a barrier although some materials can play both roles (eg self adhered bituminous membranes like Blueskin).  But for the love of all that is truly beautiful and durable, make sure the vapour barrier is on the warm side of the insulation.  Wherever that may be in the wall.

From what I understand (and kind of observed) with Habitat is thermal comfort issues.  That specific location is really, really windy and often cooler than the city itself.  It doesn’t have neighbouring buildings or other sheltering effects.  So in the winter when the temperature drops to freeze-your-nostril-hairs, the wind whips through all the openings in the building.  There is so much surface area that is exterior wall space, it is apparently very difficult to feel warm inside."

changemyview,fecrfub,t3_eoerpz,1578981813.0,"There is policy level thinking, which is concerned about declining health overall, a decrease in postive nutritional choices and a decrease in day to day activity resulting in measurable increases in average body weight across a society.  Sometimes the rhetoric about fatness at a societal level issues get misdirected at individuals.  Or misinterpreted as hate towards a population.  I think policy level thinking should take into consideration changing health demographics and develop policies that encourage positive lifestyles.  

But I am also aware that For many health issues, obesity is a proxy measure for other underlying health concerns.  While there is a correlation for lots of issues, it isn’t always clear that there is a causal relationship between obesity and some health concerns.

The  are also health concerns for a specific person.  We have a relationship with a particular human and we have concerns about their overall lifestyle.  We suck at expressing ourselves or we have the misguided idea that being hurtful with our comments will somehow motivate others to change.  In neither case is this necessarily about people’s aesthetic opinions.

The last situation is the weird one be where strangers use badly understood and poorly reported policy level thinking and sensationalized reporting to justify their own biases.  They may have a belief they are helping, much in the way that strangers that give lectures to smokers do.  They may think they are helping, or at least that is the narrative in their head.  But if there were a genuine concern about the well being of strangers, there are more productive approaches.  Ones based in better understanding of behavioural change.

The rise of obesity is not about an increase in lazy people - I doubt the values and motivations have changed in humanity that much.  It’s more that the incentives to eat high calorie and low nutrition food have increased, and the opportunity to engage ina low effort lifestyle have also increased. 

It doesn’t mean that individuals can blame other people for their problems... but the solutions are going to be different for everyone.  And for many of us, being able to accept ourselves as we are as worthy and as attractive gives us the “fuck-the-world” attitude we need to start making positive changes in life.  I don’t work out.  I can’t stand being in a gym for no purpose.  I love hiking.  So I do long walks or hikes every weekend. (10km to 20km). I will be moving and that means I can start riding my bike to work-something not currently feasible at my current location. I couldn’t afford to move closer to work until recently.  I had a job that I worked a lot of hours so I couldn’t cook dinner at home.  The places that were accessible were not enhancing my wellbeing.


Accepting myself opened a door to a better, healthier and sustainable life.  Increased to my financial health give me access to better everyday fitness I can maintain and better quality food. This is pretty common, and is backed up by some good research.

And damn it, I am actually a pretty good person to know."

In the interest of relationship bliss,  find an inexpensive red kettle to give her."
CaminoDeSantiago,fe8yacc,t3_eo4pyv,1578932309.0,"I echo other people’s comments regarding Sarria.  The last 3days walk is intensely busy.  If you want the Conpostella then look at some of the other routes.  

Most people, with training ahead of time, can do between 15 and 25km a day.  (I think that works out to 10 to 18miles-ish).  If you have mobility issues, that might be less.  

To qualify for a Compostella you must walk the last 100km.

Most important advice is keep your backpack as light as possible. There are lots of packing lists out there.

A sleeping bag likely won’t be required, but a sleeping bag liner (or a lightweight sheet) is a good idea.  If you have the money, a silk liner is light and luxurious.  Most Albergues have blankets (all of the ones I visited did).  But not sheets and they didn’t want pilgrims sleeping in direct contact with their bedding.  That was not universal

.  If you are a lady, one of the most useful items I had was a sarong.  I used it as a pillow case, a spare skirt while doing laundry, a curtain when some extra privacy was needed, a surface to lie down on the beach, a scarf, and in one memorable albergue, a wrap to walk from shower to change room.

When booking flights, for budget reasons, you may be better to fly in/out of Madrid and train to/from Santiago.  There is an international airport in Santiago, but there are usually additional connections and often a premium on flights.  Experiment when booking.

Buy travel insurance, especially if you have a small budget.  It covers all kinds of costs due to travel issues.  Including if your flights change and suddenly needing a hotel stay that wasn’t budgeted (happened to me).  It’s worth it.  

Check your medical insurance to make sure you are covered abroad.

Your bank card may or may not work.  I carried three days worth of cash, and tried every atm to replenish as I went along.  I also had a list of locations my bank said would work... turns out I was ok with every ATM.  Debit cards and credit cards are not accepted everywhere.

Read a book about one of the places that are on your route or a novel set in the place you are going.  One of the most meaningful experiences I had along the way was because I read up on some history.  It is too long to explain here, but it was a powerful epiphany about humanity.  I have no idea how it would impact your pilgrimage, but it will impact it.

Bring a little notebook."

Regardless of the truly awful behaviour of your in laws, it is damaging to your relationship with your husband to unilaterally cut him off from a relationship with his family.  Families are messy, complicated and painful and as spouses one of the biggest challenges can be figuring out relationships with in-laws.  You would be forcing a choice on your husband and forcing a conflict that he might not be ready for.

It is fair but potentially unwise for you to avoid contact with them yourself.  It is fair but potentially damaging for you to express concern about them interacting with your kids.

I would suggest you have a long conversation with your husband and ask what he needs.  And listen to what he says.  Work out an approach with him first and if he says he wants to cut them off, then fine.  But don’t bully him into your viewpoint; listen to his."

Otherwise you may have joined the unfortunate club of practical shoes for women.  Often ugly as F$&@.  But comfy.  Brands like Ecco, Hush Puppies, can have good compromise styles-not hideous and practical.  I worked in retail ins my 20s and Hush Puppies were fantastic.

CaminoDeSantiago,fdfl6pp,t3_el2i6s,1578364268.0,"There are some YouTube videos about how to take liquid soap and make dry soap flakes.  I haven’t tried it, so it is definitely something I would test ahead of time. I tried soap flakes and shampoo flakes before leaving and found them to be very awkward.

You might also look for a bar version of the brand you use-check ingredients and test ahead of time.  One bar will do for washing and clothes washing.  

Will soap residue in your clothing be an issue for you?  Many pilgrims use their bar soap to wash clothes (most days clothes get washed out by hand, and people only take very few sets of underwear and socks).  if you are really sensitive to everything that comes in contact with your skin, I would try washing your clothing by hand and wearing it while training, including with back pack.  The long potentially sweaty hours can aggravate skin sensitivity for some people.  

If you do decant your regular product into a small bottle, check the company website to see if it is distributed in Spain.  If not, write out the ingredient list, and translate before leaving.  If you need to pick something up, this will help you find comparable products.  The farmacias are the place to go!! And ask for help-many of the products are kept behind the counter (very different from shopping in North America).  They do have amazing products I must say.

Make sure you have a sun plan as well.  Reflective umbrellas, large brim hats and UV resistant clothing are good non-cream options.  If you have a preferred brand of sunscreen, bring it with you and use it.

You probably don’t need a sleeping bag, but if you are really really sensitive, you should bring a sleeping bag liner and lightweight pillow case (honestly bring them anyways),

My husband has stupid and frustrating skin.  When it gets bad, it is excruciating.  We are both really cautious about anything that comes in contact with his skin and he is particularly irritated with the combination of sweat and soap and skin products.  Clothing and bedding have to be washed with specific products and thoroughly rinsed.  If that is you, test,test,test before you go.

But your wife might need something to focus her anger on.  Anger is very much a part of grieving and often people will direct that anger in odd directions.  It is still very real and very powerful, especially if she had tried to hold onto her mom symbolically. It gets messier if she knows she was being... odd... the ladybug death is another real loss but one that she might have conflicted feelings about.

The funeral offer for the memorial was well intentioned, but I am guessing your wife can’t really express why it was the wrong thing.  I can’t either.

One of the most beautiful gifts I received when my mom died, was when an acquaintance sat and listened to me talk about my mom without judgement or interruption for an hour.  If you can be fully present-not trying to solve anything, not trying to offer condolences or fake stories, just accept what she says, that might be helpful.

Maybe share a fond memory of your MIL as a prompt and ask her to fill in the details, eg “do you remember when...?”.  Let there be silence.  Let the silence be uncomfortable before filling it with words."

However, I notice there are definitely books I am willing to reread more frequently.  At least a few times.  Then they seem to fall out of favour... I pick them up and put them down.

And there are definitely a few that I’ve thrown against the wall in disgust the second time through (metaphorically speaking).  Usually these are books that have a really fast paced story - the second time round I know what the story is and I notice the language more.  And they don’t hold up well.

Others I was fascinated to notice how my reaction changed.  I read “Cats Eye” by Margaret Atwood in my early 20s as a requirement for 2 different literature classes.  I hated it.  Or rather so much of the description of the teenaged characters hit so very close to home, it was agony to read.  The only reason I kept the book was stubbornness .
