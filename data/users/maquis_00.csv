Now, I know how good of a deal it was, but the discount store was complete junk aside from that (bought some oats and found them infested with bugs, etc) and over an hour away, so I'm not going back....

fatlogic,ffj2dcs,t1_ffio7rw,1579988653.0,"I think some of it was that, and some of it was the polarization of politics these days. I personally know some people who were against anything that Obama did (including Michelle Obama's food program) simply because he was the one in charge. I also personally know some people who are against anything Trump does, simply because he is the one doing it. Both groups would be completely in favor of some of the same actions, if the other person had done those things. But the level of polarization that had happened in politics means that some people will fight a policy because of the person doing it, rather than because of the policy itself. 

Sorry for the political rant, but I've personally seen this happen with the school lunch program discussion (among other things), and it is frustrating to me. 

That said, I've also seen some people claiming that the new rules make school lunches ""too healthy"", which I find frightening, because I don't let my kids eat school lunch because the lunches arent healthy at all!!!"
fatlogic,ffj1zmi,t3_etgmzb,1579988380.0,"I eat less restrictedly at restaurants that not only have calorie counts, but also have sodium info available online! Because I can look it up and know what I want, and adjust the rest of the day, and know I'm not going to wake up with my feet feeling icky, and all that. And if I make my own food, I don't restrict much at all, because I know exactly what's in it and how it fits with everything else I'm eating that day and any activity I had that day, and all that!"
fatlogic,ffj1kxj,t1_ffi43y5,1579988085.0,"Great. So put the calorie counts on everything, and the few of us who do care can see them, and the people who don't care won't be affected, and the small number of people who don't care won't affect the bottom line of the food companies anyways! Everybody wins!!!! 

Honestly, I wish they would put sodium content on menus, too. Trying to watch my sodium, and while some companies have nutrition facts online, most don't.... 

I also wish smaller restaurants were required to give calorie counts, too. Because I feel totally crippled at places that don't have them. I mean, in the end, I end up eating better because I'm more restrictive if I don't have the information, but....

If I'm going to have a treat, it might as well be Halo top, because then I can have a larger serving for fewer calories."

fatlogic,ffij5q1,t1_fffrgno,1579975122.0,"Find some very low calorie things that you like tolerably well. Steamed broccoli is a good one, as is celery, carrots, lettuce, kale, etc. When you are still hungry, eat those! You can add a bit of vinegar (the Kroger stores have some awesome lime or mango vinegars that taste awesome) or salt (if you aren't dealing with BP issues) or nutritional yeast on top of the veggies for flavor if you wish, but no butter/cheese/high calorie salad dressing. Oh... Mustard is another good topping. 

I like volume eating, so a very large percentage of my diet is non-starchy vegetables. I can fill up on those, and not have much calorie intake. 

Replace a lot of your higher calorie treats with fruit. Apple slices baked (or air fried) with cinnamon are amazing and taste like a good dessert. Bananas mashed with oats (and a small pinch of salt) then baked make for tasty cookies. The fruits still have a reasonably large amount of calories, so watch that, but it's still better than binging on junk food. 

And cauliflower rice is amazing.... 

I don't keep much junk food accessible. That way, when I am super snacky, my options are all pretty healthy."

My mom loves ice cream, and refuses to even try Halo top. It makes me sad. I know Halo top isn't perfect, and it has a lot of artificial ingredients, but I avoid processed foods most other places, and Halo top keeps me from overeating regular ice cream (which honestly has plenty of processed ingredients, too)."

In my experience, I've had success using the principles of the Mediterranean diet while eating flavors from all over the world. Curries aren't Mediterranean, but a curry made with real foods, focused around lots of veggies, served with whole grains and lean protein, still gives you the benefits of the Mediterranean diet. (Do make sure that any fats are healthy, though! Avocado oil and olive oil are both very good. I've heard canola is good as well, but I generally stick with avocado oil for higher temperature cooking and olive oil for flavor.)"
Cooking,ffg8wfk,t1_ffg8cis,1579900988.0,"I do both scrambled eggs and fish in a cast iron skillet. Put in a little olive oil or avocado oil, wipe it lightly with a napkin, make sure it's at temperature, then add the fish/eggs. 

If my temp is wrong, I will sometimes have a little egg stuck to the pan at the end, but usually, I can just wipe a paper towel over real quick to get any crumbs off at the end. For fish (or anything with a sauce), I usually rinse it real quick after to get any burnt on bits off, and to remove the fishy smell, then I stick it back on the stove and heat it until it's dry (sometimes with a little avocado oil if things were sticking more than normal, or if I used tomatoes in it recently). Once you get the hang of it, cast iron is the epitome of easy cleaning, since you don't actually clean it most of the time. :)"

It seems to me that any term that is obviously referring to those parts ought to work for the purpose of ensuring that the message gets across to get them help? We talk about private parts, and why nobody should ever touch them/talk about them/ask to see them/show them, but we haven't spent much time on the anatomical names for everything because my kids don't care about that part, and we are focusing on just reinforcing the part I feel is more important (that they are private, and that if anybody tries to do stuff with it, you need to talk to a trusted adult right away)."
ShitMomGroupsSay,ffehjd6,t1_fef73x0,1579848255.0,"Interesting. When I was young, a neighbor kid ran away because his parents wouldn't let him play his game system when he wanted to. Seems like a silly thing to have DHS get involved in. Parents actually parenting.... My daughter has threatened to run away because I wouldn't give her a donut when she wanted it. I convinced her to wait until daddy got home from work so she could say goodbye to him, and she forgot to run away by the time he got home. (She was also struggling with the fact that she couldn't find a way to pack her guinea pigs, but aside from them, she was packed.... She had her Kindle, one change of clothes, and her favorite blanket in her backpack. 

I know a neighbor mentioned that they had a child that ran away to another neighbor's house because the other neighbor was a ""nicer mommy"" (as in... Not the child's mommy, so didn't discipline the kid). 

In my experience, I have a hard time believing that most leaving home situations require dhs involvement, especially if the kid isn't going far/isn't old enough to really understand. Honestly, if my kid had actually taken off down the street, I had the phone number for a friend 3 doors down, and was going to call her and have her pop out and ask my daughter where she was going, etc.... I doubt she would've made it past that point...."
nutrition,ffe4qit,t3_et1hjc,1579836655.0,"Dash diet and Mediterranean diet are supposed to be the best for heart health. There are tons of Mediterranean diet cookbooks out there, but the quality of them is really hit or miss. The big thing to remember is the principles of both diets: 
* Lots of fruits and veggies
* Whole grains
* Some lean proteins (could be animal based or not... Mediterranean diet generally includes fish and sometimes chicken, but focuses on lentils and beans. I believe dash is about the same)
* Minimal sugar and processed foods

If you are sodium-sensitive, watch that as well. 

Exercise is also super important for heart health. Just walking more will help significantly."

Actually, the one time I have had issues with my stainless steel is when I poach eggs. Although I finally learned how to do them without getting the annoying proteins stuck everywhere, so that's better now, too. 

I personally hate cleaning stuff that has multiple parts/moving parts.

But, I find that going for 4 miles at 10:50-10:00 pace probably gives me at least as much benefit as 1 mile at 8:30 pace, while the latter would probably be a harder effort. I'd rather build my endurance anyways, and I've found that as I'm consistent with what I'm doing, it seems to improve my speed as well.

I convinced her to wait until daddy got home from work so she could say goodbye to him, and she forgot to run away by the time he got home. (She was also struggling with the fact that she couldn't find a way to pack her guinea pigs, but aside from them, she was packed.... She had her Kindle, one change of clothes, and her favorite blanket in her backpack. 

I know a neighbor mentioned that they had a child that ran away to another neighbor's house because the other neighbor was a ""nicer mommy"" (as in... Not the child's mommy, so didn't discipline the kid). 

In my experience, I have a hard time believing that most leaving home situations require dhs involvement, especially if the kid isn't going far/isn't old enough to really understand.

* Lots of fruits and veggies
* Whole grains
* Some lean proteins (could be animal based or not... Mediterranean diet generally includes fish and sometimes chicken, but focuses on lentils and beans. I believe dash is about the same)
* Minimal sugar and processed foods

Serve one of the breasts with rice (just boil in water -- lots of recipes online, or there's usually a good one on the bag) and some veggies (frozen are easy -- just microwave them, but start at a shorter time from what the bag says, so you don't accidentally overcook), and you have a healthy balanced dinner. 

I do recommend a meat thermometer when learning to cook on your own. Determining when meat is cooked enough takes some experience, and you don't want to end up making yourself or someone else sick while learning. 

Oh... And when you eat out, take a moment to see if you can figure out what is in the food you eat. Some of the things I cook regularly came from me analyzing a meal at a restaurant and realizing that i could make the exact same thing healthier for less money."

This time, I had 2 young kids of my own, and it was ""you're starting to have negative consequences from your weight. Your blood pressure is going high, and you should fix this before it becomes serious."" And at some point I also developed some sort of medical anxiety that means that I'm scared of something happening medically that would take me away from my kids. I had a friend who lost her mom when she was 12. Incidentally, her younger siblings were the ages my 2 kids were at the time of this happening, and i was just thinking of how even to this day, they still have struggles related to their mom dying when they were young. So I guess it was really just my fear of leaving my kids without a mom that made the difference for me."

After work: 

Pick up some books on coding in a language of your choice, read the books, then come up with some simple projects. Do those projects, then come up with some more complex projects. Do those... Repeat. 

Use Coursera/Udacity/edx, since they are free. Udemy is pretty cheap if you buy when they have their ""every class is $9.99"" sales. If you go to some university websites, sometimes you can get the syllabus for some classes without having to be a student. Look at those, and see if they link to project descriptions and such. That's a good jumping off point for some good learning projects. 

Play with the computers. Build a website. Build and program a robot. Build a small game. Just program stuff for fun. 

Eventually, you will be ready to start applying for programming jobs, and when you get one, you can quit your other job. Or, you will discover that you don't like programming, and you won't be out 12k for that informtion.

For a salad, you can have chicken to top with, and garbanzo beans. Everyone can choose which option they want. 

I would suggest keeping an eye or at least having a discussion about diet, just like you would with any of your other children. I tried going vegetarian when I was in high school, and apparently I was more grainarian than anything, since I didn't like beans/lentils or most veggies. So, I ate a lot of pasta, rice, etc., None of which was very good for me. Now, I think that a child wanting to make a diet change (of any sort) is a great opportunity to have a discussion about healthy diets, nutrients, and the importance of making sure you get all the things your body needs. In her case, you can talk about what nutrients she has in the past gotten primarily from meat, and see what her plans are for where she will get those nutrients. Will she still have dairy? Eggs? Does she like lentils or beans better? What's her feeling on tofu/tempeh? What are some balanced vegetarian meals that she would like to eat? 

I would also discuss *why* she's choosing to become vegetarian. In my experience, choosing vegetarianism for ethical/environmental reasons looks different food-wise than choosing vegetarianism for health/weight-loss reasons. 

I'm currently flexitarian-pescatarian-plant-focused-something (totally not strict, except that I avoid junk food and processed stuff). Since I have changed my diet for health-reasons rather than for ethical/environmental reasons, I make different decisions in certain circumstances from someone who made similar dietary changes for other reasons."
