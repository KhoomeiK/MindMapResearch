They're terrible in low light so keep that in mind if your studio lighting is sub optimal. You may have to open the Iris up more than you think to get a good image, so that can affect depth of field.

EventProduction,febnkwz,t3_eo6cjy,1578960723.0,"You should find an AV vendor you like and trust, and then travel them. Almost without exception in house AV is overpriced and under qualified. If you PM me your location and what kind of events you do I can probably put you in touch with someone in that regard. As far as others, well frankly your AV vendor could almost certainly do your exhibits. Catering is a different matter. Just remember, whoever the preferred vendors are for the house, are kicking something back. With AV it may be as much as 60% of your spend that's getting kicked back to the house. Just approach with a wary eye, and knowing the house has an incentive to push you to preferred vendors, and your goals are not often aligned with the house."
