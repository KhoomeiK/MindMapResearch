AskReddit,ff4p3gu,t1_ff1zobz,1579569034.0,"Consider the sentence ""Alice is taller than Bob.""

This statement is making an assertion about the relationship between two numbers: The height (in inches, say) of Alice and the height of Bob. Specifically, this sentence is asserting that the former number (Alice's height) is *greater than* Bob's height.

An expression like ""72 > 70"" is a shorthand for the same kind of assertion. In this instance, the expression has the same meaning as the sentence ""The number 72 is greater than the number 70"" or perhaps simply ""72 is greater than 70."" The expression ""72 > 70"" is therefore true, since these sentences are true.

I could also write the expression ""70 > 72"". This is shorthand for the sentence ""70 is greater than 72"", a false statement.

I could also write ""70 < 72"" which means ""70 is less than 72"", a true statement, or ""72 < 70"" which means ""72 is less than 70"", a false statement.

So we see that whenever we have an expression like ""Some number > Some other number"" or ""Some number < Some other number"", that expression is making an assertion about the relationship between two numbers in the same way as ""Alice is taller than Bob."" That assertion may be true or false. (Maybe Alice isn't really taller than Bob.)

The symbol "">"" is a shorthand for the phrase ""is greater than"" in the same way that the symbol ""&"" is shorthand for the word ""and"", or the symbol ""+"" is shorthand for the word ""plus"". Likewise, ""<"" is shorthand for the phrase ""is less than"".

How can you remember which is which? As noted several places in the above discussion, the ""big side"" of the symbol "">"" or ""<"" faces the number which is asserted to be greater.

So, for example, the expression ""23 > 1"" is making the assertion ""23 is greater than 1"" (a true statement) because the big side of "">"" (the left side) is facing the 23.

Likewise, the expression ""23 < 1"" is making the assertion ""1 is greater than 23"" (a false statement) because the big side of ""<"" (the right side) is facing the 1. The key here is to note that an entirely-equivalent way of saying ""1 is greater than 23"" is to say ""23 is less than 1"". Thus ""23 < 1"" *also* could be read as ""23 is less than 1"", which would be the more common way of reading the expression ""23 < 1"" since - as mentioned above - the symbol ""<"" is short for the phrase ""is less than"".

For whatever it's worth, I *did* find an example of someone who was technically pardoned after being impeached, although it is a slight stretch.

In 1862 United States District Judge [West Hughes Humphreys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Hughes_Humphreys#Impeachment,_conviction_and_removal_from_office) was impeached and convicted by Congress on a number of articles connected to his joining the Confederacy. He remained a Confederate until the war's end.

In 1868, President Andrew Johnson [issued a pardon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Johnson#Completion_of_term) ""ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted."" This would have included Humphreys, a previously-impeached individual."

If Congress could *prevent* a President from exercising their pardon powers through the use of the impeachment process, that would constitute ""legislative control"". This is very clear.

They rammed a tube into my nose and then down my esophagus into my stomach. That hurts a lot more than you'd think. The tube was attached to a suction pump for a full 48 hours of continuous stomach pumping as I lay in a hospital bed. The tube was immensely irritating to my nose and throat, but I wasn't allowed to drink any water to alleviate the discomfort. In fact, I wasn't allowed to swallow anything at all... not even my own saliva, which was unfortunate because the tube caused excessive salivation. I had to suction out my own mouth with a dental tool every 30 seconds or so.
