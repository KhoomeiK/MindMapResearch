Turns out, I actually enjoy it when I'm able to build up my endurance gradually. I'm currently thisclose to being able to do 5K without stopping."

fatlogic,ff9jje2,t1_ff9fq41,1579714355.0,"I flew at my highest weight and I'm a 5'10 woman. Still no problem fitting in widthwise.

My main problem was that the in-flight entertainment screen on the seat in front of me was designed for someone who's apparently 5'2 and would only tilt down, even though the person in the seat in front of you is almost guaranteed to recline the seat a little."
LearnJapanese,ff8zlfm,t3_esbfmg,1579701005.0,"That's why I wrote N4 this past December. If job hunting or university applications are the only valid reasons for taking the JLPT, then even the N1 is useless for me. I live in Canada, my industry uses English, and I have no intention of ever moving to Japan.

Personally, I believe that taking the test for personal achievement and progress tracking is perfectly valid. Having an idea of where your strengths and weaknesses are helps you identify your weak points so you can work on them, and having the deadline means you'd be motivated to study more regularly than you might have otherwise, so you progress farther."
LearnJapanese,ff82fvg,t3_es4czv,1579664222.0,"This was my first JLPT. Passed N4!  Language Knowledge 70/120; Listening 31/60  -> overall 101/180

Vocab - A; Grammar - B; Reading - A;

I knew listening was a weak point going in, so I'm happy to have squeaked by.  Gotta step up my listening for next time."

fatlogic,ff72m4b,t3_ervuu1,1579639874.0,"I am so pissed off at having to practically start over, AGAIN. I swear, I can do great for 3 or 4 months, get just shy of halfway to goal, and I just feel so sick of never getting to have large quantities of junk that I burn out and by the time I claw myself back to sanity, the year is over and I'm back where I started.  The weird thing is, I usually manage to fit in half a thin-crust pizza, or a single-serving bag of chips, or a burger with a side salad etc, in my budget just fine. I'm tall and I'm only aiming for a pound a week."

fatlogic,fekfy1q,t1_feg90bb,1579199224.0,"Personally, I just see major issues with the worldbuilding. No wizarding elementary schools? No working mom witches?  The UK gets a wizarding school to itself, but there's only one school for all of North America? How does anyone learn to run a business or not get taken advantage of financially if there are no math classes?"

fatlogic,fegpy44,t3_eorlnp,1579099766.0,"What's with this obsession with other people looking like them? Nobody says I'm shaming people with long hair by wanting to get mine cut. Nobody says I'm shaming people with glasses for wearing contact lenses. Nobody says I'm shaming people with dyed hair by leaving mine natural. I'm not shaming fat people by watching what I eat and working out. Insisting there's only one acceptable way for people to look seems pretty problematic.

You do you, but they need to let me do me, as well."
fatlogic,fede79e,t1_fed6nod,1579009047.0,"By that logic, nothing weighs more than anything else. Yes, muscle DOES weigh more than the same volume of fat."

Anyway, finally got my hands on a replacement, so here's my submission for Lesson 1.

Thanks in advance.

In the past, doctors did perform procedures on patients without their knowledge, so the requirement that they ensure their patients know what is to be done, and the potential risks involved is very important. 

To invoke it for something as quick and harmless as getting weighed is ridiculous, though. Especially when you can ask not to be told your weight."
