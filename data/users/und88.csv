politics,fff186q,t1_ffey2iv,1579872887.0,"> A Democratic official working on the impeachment trial told Politico that figures involved in the campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, the issue at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, frequently used ""z"" in reference to Zelensky. The official did not dispute that Schiff misidentified the subject of the Parnas message.
> ""Beginning with Mr. Giuliani's May 10 letter to President Zelensky two months earlier and leading up to Mr. Giuliani's August 2 meeting with Mr. Zelensky's representatives in Spain, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parnas actively sought high-level engagement with President Zelensky and his administration to carry out the President's corrupt scheme,"" the official said. ""If Mr. Giuliani sought out dirt from other sources, that would be consistent with their overall effort.""


Sounds like an important mistake, but not a lie and it doesn't take away from any of the rest of the mountain of evidence. Nothing else you stated is in this article."

So even if organizations have no bias today, the decisions are influenced by the past, and the effects may continue even longer.
