politics,ffcva4n,t3_ess4zz,1579807988.0,This country is fucked. Republicans are openly covering up what the POS Trump has and is doing while ruining the environment and getting us wildly in debt. We have a president making himself richer and a party refusing to do their jobs. Somehow everyone seems to be ok with this. We are fucked.
Futurology,ffcqwxl,t3_esqkyd,1579805394.0,WTF does anyone support Trump or vote Republican anymore? The entire party is cancer. They seem to think they don’t live on Earth anymore.

One of my best friends bit the trump hook hard and he’s a completely different person. His Facebook is just rabid ragings against liberals and wall memes.
