asmr,ff5vru4,t1_feyw8z7,1579611920.0,ITS CUTE THAT YOU THINK INCOGNITO WORKS. I assume by “works in IT” you mean you went to community college for 2 years. You certainly don’t know much if you truly believe the incognito tabs works. People were sneaking around paywalls with it and they made it easier for companies to get around you using it. Or in other words IT DOESNT WORK. Started back in June of 19 but I mean I thought you were in IT so shouldn’t you know that? 😉
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff5vm9y,t1_feyq08v,1579611777.0,The debt isn’t in my name fuck face. The debt was there BEFORE we were married. I don’t know where the fuck you live but in NEW YORK STATE when you marry the other person IS NOT responsible for the others debts. What part of that is so fucking hard for you to understand? You’re calling me an idiot over something YOU CANT COMPREHEND. Go google New York State for five fucking seconds and THEN come back. You cunt.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fey8suy,t1_felhn07,1579442224.0,A prenup only applies to the other person in your marriage not the government. If I had a prenup that said “I refuse to ever pay taxes” it WOULDNT BE LEGAL. AGAIN I could have fought them and got my money back but it would have cost me more in legal fees then the money. So no it is you who doesn’t understand how prenups work or the tax system. They didn’t look up to see if we had a prenup before pulling the taxes think about that. Prenups are not magically filed somewhere where everybody can go around seeing them to see what every bodies prenup is so why don’t you go pop off to somebody else because I know what im fucking talking about with MY LIFE.

They followed the woman who went around town “collecting” the stories to change the points or whatever they use. They were trying to say there were no more drunks and that the area was cleaner. I don’t believe that even if you have a few short term benefits that it will be beneficial in the long run.

He had these loans BEFORE we were married and I proved that to them but their answer was basically “sucks to sucks.” I contacted a lawyer and they told me it would cost me more then $3,000 in lawyer fees to fight them.

relationship_advice,fei5r1w,t3_ep9v9b,1579130885.0,"I live in New York, in Ithaca. We’re talking massive cost of living. We chose to move to pay less and it was a 45 minutes commute. I don’t know what she’s talking about the added expense of driving takes her down from 600 to 200 a month. My car insurance is one of the best you can get full coverage and way over the $25,000 limit I believe we have $100,000. Even with that my insurance is only $115 a month. She would already have to pay that anyway. So her only added expense is gas. My 45 minute drive to work seven days a week during the summer was still only $80 in gas if prices were high. The added oil changes were only $30 more every four months. I should add this 45 minute or more was a 25 mile commute.  Ask her bluntly about this and ask to see real numbers or for her to be honest with you about what’s really going on."

It’s only because we didn’t use any nurses help while there anyway not that it wasn’t appreciated we were just confident in our parental skills. I do think this is meant to make fun of bad insurance because don’t forget this is set in Pennsylvania in the United States. They don’t have good social programs there or good state income based insurance so there wouldn’t be any extra help for them “in real life.”
