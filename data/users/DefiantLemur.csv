Fallout,ffnv3xs,t1_ffn9f6y,1580071253.0,It's still not the same being able to kill the enemy takes away from the horror IMO
Fallout,ffn7ujj,t1_ffn4eku,1580062932.0,Oh I played in the Beta and played maybe 60 hours after launch. It wasn't that bad for me. Just typical Bethesda shit polish. The engine definitely needs work but it can still make pretty new games like TES 6.
Fallout,ffn3zvl,t1_ffn2bre,1580061817.0,They've been upgrading the engine over the years. So it's not like it isn't up to snuff. It's just it can't handle vehicles or mass combat well. Which is why Skyrim was a shit civil war and Fallout doesn't have vehicles.
fo76,ffn3rhl,t1_ffn3gca,1580061731.0,True flamethrowers only work a psychological weapon. Hard to show npcs reacting to that
Fallout,ffmyqvb,t1_ffigtub,1580060229.0,Cars do exist in lore. Mostly in the west coast. What doesn't exist is Bethesda's ability to make a decent game engine.
fo76,ffmptya,t1_ffmpb3z,1580057691.0,They've been that way since the Fallout 3 and 4. It's less of a Fo76 issue and more of a Bethesda Fallout game issue.
warcraftlore,fflip8h,t1_ffl324g,1580040102.0,Good thing we have Smart Ogres that came with the Mag'har. They seemed to have disappeared after the quest but they were in Duratar with the Mag'har at the end.
fo76,ffife5l,t1_ffi77nf,1579972556.0,Eyebots were designed before the war by robco. Then Enclave just modded them
wholesomememes,ffhzmmb,t1_ffhxd3x,1579960468.0,He already said she deserved to be loved and respected so thats implied
worldnews,ffhmqz8,t1_ffhj21j,1579942762.0,Sure but we know that will never happen.
worldnews,ffglbgy,t1_ffgiw68,1579908877.0,Nah. I'm a liberal and I support drone striking a leader of American neo-nazis hiding in Russia.
interestingasfuck,ffgibzg,t1_ffgg3ef,1579906891.0,"Never knew that, got any links"
PrequelMemes,ffgi0od,t1_ffg8hl5,1579906687.0,In alternate universe Palpi dies to Mace and Padme falls out of love and creates a broken hearted Anakin with two kids and a seperated parents situation. Making him fall to darkness out of possesive jealousy.
Tinder,fffq6py,t1_ffewjct,1579889407.0,16 to 18 depending on the State in the US. 17 where I live. Still fucked up IMO. No way me a grown ass man is gonna fuck with a Teenager.
starwarsmemes,fff2g0g,t3_et6aiv,1579873882.0,Someone did this and I responded General Kenobi. She unmatched. Her loss
AskReddit,ffekv38,t1_ffeiyl2,1579852301.0,Which is funny because Communism is supposedly further left of socialism
AskReddit,ffef05i,t1_ffe24fe,1579845517.0,People started throwing Republicanism under the democracy umbrella for some reason. I just rolled with it because its easier to interact with people that way.
television,ffeeqof,t1_ffdvl5l,1579845246.0,Voter suppression exists to prevent or at least deter voters of certain demographics.
AskReddit,ffeemna,t1_ffdywh5,1579845135.0,Oligarchies can exist in non-socialist capitalistic societies. Socialism can exist with capitalism as well.
AskReddit,ffeegnx,t1_ffe2crt,1579844970.0,"Almost like present day Chinese ""communism"" isn't true communism."
AskReddit,ffeeep4,t1_ffe3x1k,1579844915.0,Not classic oligarchy. And billionaires exist in China. Just google Chinese Billionaires.
HobbyDrama,ffdm35t,t1_ffdl8i4,1579823777.0,Plus me and my friends sometimes make really dark jokes. If I can make light of 9/11.  I can say Dues Vult.
AskReddit,ffdlwv1,t1_ffdljl8,1579823668.0,"Chinas brand of communism is a oligarchy. Just  like 1950s USSRs communism was a dictatorship. Most government types regardless of what they call themselves generally fall under Democracy, Oligarchy, Dictatorship or Monarchy."
