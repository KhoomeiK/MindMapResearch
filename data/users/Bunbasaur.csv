2. To her funeral, I tied a stem of rosemary into a circle and wore it over my heart. At the end of the service I had my husband place it in her casket wih her, over her heart. In Polish tradition, rosemary is a symbol of love and remembrance. 

3. I'm thinking of getting my first tattoo in her honor on her birthday - a small triquetra on the inside of my arm near the crook of my elbow. I'm not sure why exactly I associate the symbol with her so strongly, but I do!

4. I fostered and kinda accidentally adopted a cat in her honor. For the first few Thursdays after her passing, I had a lot of animal encounters. First a cardinal, then a doe, then a cat crying outside our bedroom window. I went out to find the kitty but couldn't, and the next day on FB there was an urgent call for someone to come rescue a stray kitty that had been hurt at a truck depot. I took him in and the animal encounters stopped. I strongly associate my sister with cats - her favorite animal."

1. Go to the dog Park, beach, or other favorite spot
2. At the favorite spot, commence belly rubs and favorite games
3. Get all the human foods that are safe to eat that your pupper always drools for - cheeseburgers, ice cream, pizza, hot dogs. Enjoy them together.
4. Invite dog friends over for a play date. Treat it like a real party and get some cake and hats.
5. If your area is warm enough, hit a splash pad or outdoor waterpark type area
6. If you have a friend who is a good photographer, invite them along for each of these activities- itll be so nice to look back on
7. Make some paw prints. In my experience, ink works better than paint.

Ingredients

 3 cups unbleached bread flour

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast

1 1/2 cups lukewarm milk (2% or whole have worked best for me)

Directions

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt and yeast.

Add milk and stir until the mixture forms a shaggy but cohesive dough.

Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let dough sit at room temperature for 8-24 hours. Dough will bubble up and rise. (I like to leave it in the turned-off oven) 

An hour¬†and a half¬†before you want to eat the bread, preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place your Dutch oven, uncovered, into the preheated oven for 30 minutes.

While your Dutch oven preheats, turn dough onto a well-floured surface and, with floured hands, form the dough into a ball. Cover dough loosely with plastic wrap and let rest.

After the 30 minutes are up, carefully remove Dutch oven. With floured hands, place the bread dough into it.

Bake for 30 minutes covered. Remove cover and bake for 7-15 minutes more, uncovered (just keep an eye on it as cooking times will vary).

Remove the bread and place on a cutting board. Slice and serve!"
uterinedidelphys,fcnae8p,t1_fcn73j6,1577807323.0,"So my diagnosis came in stages.

First, about 10 years ago, when I first became sexually active, my boyfriend (now husband) ""discovered"" the septum that divided my vagina into two chambers. One side is like 75% and the other is the 25%, so not equally sized at all.

That led to the discovery of the two cervices which meant I got an internal ultrasound (owww) and my first MRI.

At that point they couldn't tell if it was a bicornate uterus or what, and because this condition usually involves a missing kidney too, I went back for a full abdominal ultrasound and an MRI with contrast. 

Officially, about 2 or 3 years ago now, we finally landed on: 2 uterus, 2 ovaries, 2 cervices, 1 vagina split in two by 1 septum, 2 kidneys, and PCOS. So, I feel like I'm just swimming in extra body parts here.

The septum is definitely a problem for me in having comfortable sex, so I'm having it resected sometime this year after extensive testing for an unrelated cardiac thing."

Maybe it's not quite like that for people who grew up in countries that had little/no involvement?

Even if your planet was directly impacted by TCW, maybe there's a bit of erasing history or denial or distrust (like people here now who don't think the holocaust happened)"

The Star Wars universe is also *so big*. We're on one single planet - I wouldn't be able to tell you the names of battles, wars, leaders, or special forces from most other countries."

1 - p = 0.99493

1 - p ^ 18 = .913

math,fc9p38j,t3_egcxzv,1577556026.0,"A few days ago, I came across a blog post on ""the data science of baby naming."" The author included a tool to see the probability that your child would share a name with another child in their class year. The author/post didn't describe in detail the data used in the formula, just that ""an average class of students in the US is about 492"" - so I'm assuming it used the total number of babies recorded with a given name and that data point.

I'd like to learn a formula I can use to drill down to more specific probabilities and percentages with more pinpointed data. In other words, I'd like to learn what formula could help me determine *""In Alabama, there is an N% chance that Ava will be in a classroom with another Ava, and an N% likelihood that there will be another Ava in her class year.""*

I have the following actual data points:

- In 2018 there were 293 girls named Ava born in the state of Alabama

- In 2018, 28,303 girls born in total in that state

- There are, on average, 19 children in a Kindergarten classroom in Alabama

- There are, on average, 467 children in a class year at schools in Alabama 

- The sex-at-birth ratio is about 51% boys, 49% girls

Note, I have no background in mathematics at all, I'm just really interested in this specific topic and would love to have something I can plug into an Excel spreadsheet to play around with future baby names for a totally unneccessary but very fun way to pass time."
