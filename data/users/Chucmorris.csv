dishwashers,fez4tvf,t3_eqnado,1579453868.0,First order of business is organizing and clearing food. Putting stuff to soak. Making room by putting stuff on the floor. Then start to get in the groove of stuff. I kinda miss it.

dishwashers,fepddel,t3_ekm0uk,1579317742.0,"Sounds like you need something fabricated to make it work. I'm thinking hooks that can hold up the trays or with clips stainless steel. Maybe built directly into the machine or on the trays. 


Ah totally different idea is pressure washing them. A heat pressure washer. Although it could probably splash alot of water back and it would have to be done outdoors cause it's gas powered."

learndesign,fcz10ke,t3_eio81p,1578091512.0,"I like the colors. The font looks good. Spacing looks good. The only problem I have is the paddles. It's just little details. If you think of a paddle the head is usually perpendicular to the handle. Yours is a little off. 

In my head paddle are symmetrical. Yours aren't, one side a little  off. Then the tips. They should have softer edges. Think of the wood and how it's sanded to a nice smooth edge.
Overall great work."

dishwashers,fcywyu8,t3_eiwwyu,1578088908.0,"I would get pain in my upper left part of my back because of all the scrubbing I did on pans and I wasn't even full time only weekends.

With any job repetitive motions can be bad. Being sore can be normal specially after a long day. Just think of it as exercise. If the soreness persist for too long then I would start to worry. Normally being sore 2days after is normal. 3 if it was a hard workout.

As you work remember to keep your back straight. If you look down constantly stretch your head back every once in a while. Look into reversal of posture stretches and do those throughout your day. When lifting use your legs, back straight. You could use improper lifting but that leaves you prone to hurt your back. So avoid it when possible. 

Unfortunately, as we get older these are things we have to look out for. Keep proper body mechanics in mind. Get massages to help with knots and muscle pain. Stretch. Get a nice pair of shoes. I always recommend working boots. At least a 100 dollars they will last you a long time. Anti-fatigue from timberland pros or double welted from wolverine. They usually are non-slip and waterproof.

The only good part about busy days is the day flies by. You don't have time to think about anything else."
dishwashers,fcyve0n,t3_ej3n96,1578087909.0,"Honestly, co-workers make the job that much better. Would you rather have a great job with shitty co-workers. Or a shitty job with shitty co-workers. I know I would rather have cool workers in any of those.

We all know its a shitty job. Some can tolerate it more than others. At the end of the day, if you decide to leave. That's ok.

 If you get along with them, try to keep in contact with them. They probably want to see you better yourself. If they got a better job, they probably will jump at it too. 

It's a part of life. You have to look out for yourself first."
landscaping,fcyrhpo,t3_eizw4w,1578085543.0,"It is basically hoses under a layer of dirt. And exits at the sprinklers. The house is heavy duty plastic. So even if you hit it with a shovel it still takes some force to go through.

As long as your careful. You could reuse them. Placing them is a little harder but doable. You really just need a nice flat shovel."
Surface,fcuktm8,t3_eipwtv,1577983229.0,The sleeve i have bends the cloth edges and it irks me. Not sure if I should go a size up or what.
learndesign,fcsssbf,t1_fcsc1ry,1577924195.0,No problem. I hope I wasn't too harsh. Your doing better than I have done last year. Good job. Keep working hard.
whatisthisthing,fcss77d,t1_fcsnvnl,1577923775.0,I don't think it's a matter of how often. These machines are usually worked for years. And are very expensive to replace. So it's bound to happen specially if they are older equipment.
food,fcokj7p,t1_fcoe9x2,1577834542.0,I wasn't impressed either.
dishwashers,fcohrcg,t1_fciret1,1577832527.0,"Yeah that's what I do. I don't mind paying back if I have to.

Some people prefer putting more in to get back in tax returns. Some would argue that's unwise because it's a interest free loan to the government.

I think it's whatever makes the person happy. Neither way is wrong.

I would probably upgrade my computer, or take a vacation. Or probably invest in myself and go to school. Or maybe look for another job."

AskReddit,fckv8oz,t1_fck4631,1577733926.0,"You know what. All you need is a trailer, a weedwhip, and a leaf blower. Maybe a rake. If it works out you could keep upgrading. You could start only weekends. Where I'm from there are tons of landscapers and plenty of work for all of them. You could also try working for one. Big companies start at about 15 an hour."

news,fbxuqw2,t1_fbxtfni,1577201035.0,"Vaping the flower is my go to. It hits slowly and doesn't last too long. You could make a small amount last a decent amount of time. Plus you can make edibles with the ""used"" bud."
learndesign,fbx0rkh,t1_fbwuq1b,1577165052.0,"I think they(letters) should have more of a curve. To make the mug pop. Look at letters on a cylinder. The spacing isn't even. It's a little slanted. Unless that was your plan. The Y is a little washed out. Maybe outline with a thin black line.

The execution overall is poor. I can't tell if the bottom is part of the mug,coaster or a plate. The bottom looks a little crooked. I think you will have more luck with vector drawing. You will get crisper lines. And more control than a brush stroke.

The coffee looks like it's in motion. Water in a vessel like a mug is usually a little more calm. 

Also I would pick more complimentary colors. Like a triad. 

Good job though. Keep working on it."
IAmA,fbvx0u5,t3_eenred,1577137316.0,Love what you do. Keep up the good work. I would love to see your work space/shop and recording devices/studio. Any way that could be possible?
