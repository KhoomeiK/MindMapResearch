Ageism isn't about how good you are, it's about how old you are, quite literally. 30-something managers feel uncomfortable with 50+ year old subordinates, and of course many other factors that all are part of ageism.

Yes, knowing a lot of stuff, especially if you're a bleeding edge specialist on a specific hot thing can counteract some of it, but even if you haven't felt the sting yet at 51, it's coming.

This thread is full of 40-50 year olds who think they're exempt because it hasn't happened to them yet, but get real. Ageism isn't about your skill set. Having a hot skill set helps, and looking youthful and at least slightly in touch with the current world and dressing ""right"" does too, but ageism is about age."

You can shoot through a LiFePo4 battery with a high powered rifle and punch a hole clean through it and it will do nothing but smoke for at least 15 minutes or more, and probably never show an open flame. 

Compare that to Lithium Cobalt, which is what Tesla uses, that has three times the energy density... you puncture one of those and you have a runaway reaction on your hands in very short order, just because there is so much more energy in there.

TenX,ff8pusn,t3_es0ypw,1579690941.0,"There's nothing preventing you from having both. Both have their selling points; Crypto.com lets you use fiat and use it as a pure pre-paid card, and if you lock a lot of your money up you can get a card that gets you into airport lounges and such. However, you have to send them crypto and convert it to fiat manually before you can shop, which is kind of sucky.

Also, I don't think it's shipping per se yet, they're just gearing up to do so. People who want one can complete their applications and documentation now, in preparation for shipping. 

So both cards are in the ""preparing to ship"" stage. Neither is yet shipping.

TenX will by all accounts continue using the same model as it did on the card I had (for two weeks before their provider lost the Visa license) - just buy stuff, and crypto gets subtracted from your account. That's also no doubt why you don't have your own keys for the wallet - so TenX can do things like that without your input.

I think TenX does it better. You don't have to sell your crypto until the second you want to use some of it. Back when I had it I put in $200 worth of BTC but could buy for $300 worth as the BTC I put in just kept going up in value. If I had had to sell the whole $200 of BTC the same day I put it in to have some fiat to buy for, like I would with the Crypto.com card, I would have been able to buy only $200 worth.

That assumes crypto will go up, sure. Also, there are some tax implications, technically I owe the state about $20 in profit in my BTC... But TenX seems like by far the easiest option, just put some BTC in and use the card anywhere."

Lead-acid cells should be kept above 80% at all times to maximize life span, and never be drained below 50% charge."
networking,ff8hu29,t3_es3wwl,1579679148.0,"Well, Lithium is obviously better in every way, but the cost is higher up front. The TCO may well work out better, in most other walks of life Lithium now has a better TCO than lead-acid. 

There are also drop-in replacements, batteries in the same form factor as normal but Lithium with a built in battery management system so the UPS software doesn't even have to know it's running Lithium. Though buying a Lithium unit up front may be better.

The ""generational shift"" away from Lead Acid is still in its starting phase, UPS companies are beginning to release more and more Lithium units but I don't think any major one has replaced their entire ""stack"" of options with Lithium equivalents. But it's just a matter of time, because lead-acid kind of sucks."
networking,ff8hj48,t1_ff7su77,1579678761.0,"Let's not forget also that Lithium can both discharge and recharge vastly faster than any lead-acid. This lowers the period you're vulnerable, after the power has come back but the UPS is not yet full. 

Looking at price-performance has to include a look at performance, and not only do Lithium cells last many times longer, they also perform better all the while. 

Honestly, if the money is at all there for it, buying Lithium probably is the way to go now. Lead-acid is old tech from 1850, and it has pretty much had its day.

UPS:es use a standard form factor for the batteries so retrofitting Lithium cells is also a thing as long as the batteries have built in BMS circuitry.

Use the other two for all your other network traffic, the VM network and the like. The gigabit ports you don't even really need.

Also, two hosts is not an ideal number. You want three or better, with two of them capable of handling the total load together in an emergency. Thus, if one host dies, you can rock on with the other two until you can get the third back up.

The reason you want 10 gig switches in the mix between your hosts and storage is that you may want to add more hosts.

AAC should be enabled out of the box on the BTR3, if you don't touch anything it adapts to what it is sent. I just manually disabled the ones I didn't want.

If the only way you can run the way people run today - by hammering their heel into the ground at three times their bodyweight due to momentum - is to have 2 inches of padding in the shoe, you're running wrong. 

The current style of running  completely takes the foot and shin out of the running process, where they should be used to flex and minimize the shock when putting your foot down.

The Vibrams may look really stupid but the idea behind them isn't. The way we run when we run barefoot is the way humans should run, and that is not hammering your heel into the ground hard enough to crunch bone without shit tons of padding."

Of course it matters if you move your entire crypto pile to their wallet, but that would be foolish. Just move in as much crypto as you want to have fiat on hand to spend, that can be just a few hundred bucks at a time, which limits your potential loss at any given time to that balance.

Your keys, your money is of course a very important rule, but that has to be tempered with what is and is not sensible. If you have a million bucks worth of crypto, moving all that to a crypto card wallet would be insanity. Almost all of that should be in a cold wallet, and the recovery phrase should be written up and in a safety deposit box. 

TenX is seamless to use, all you do is dump crypto there and spend with the card after that as if it was any old Visa. They'll be reissuing their cards in Europe here at the very beginning of this year an I assume Monaco (who isn't as good at the crypto wallet thing, but are better at other things) will also have European cards soon.

ethereum,fenofmg,t3_eq2avp,1579288545.0,"A crypto to fiat card is, for all intents and purposes, an exchange that exchanges your crypto to fiat.

It's just a very convenient exchange, that can do the conversion smoothly; in the case of TenX, their backend does it seamlessly, buy something, they pay it in fiat, and withdraw the crypto from your balance. You can't control your keys in that way of course, but since the card is to be used basically like any other prepaid, it's hardly a big deal. Just keep enough crypto there that you have enough to shop from, no more.

But make no mistake, this is not the crypto revolution. This is in some ways a step backward, an admission that fiat is better or that it can't be transcended."

BudgetAudiophile,femqmmn,t3_epusoy,1579266753.0,"Vanatoo Transparent Zero ($300-ish). Fully powered, have Bluetooth, have USB or aux in, and come with a remote, and killer sound quality. For the $200, buy any decent powered sub and plug that in on those and they stop playing bass and send it to the sub. Boom, kick-ass 2.1 movie and music output. They sell direct from Vanatoo.com with a 30 day no questions asked return policy, so there's really no risk. Total cables: 1 power cable to one of the speakers, one cable to the other speaker, and optionally one cable to the sub (which needs its own power cable). 

Optionally, the Transparent One Encore's. Those go down to 40 Hz or so which is pretty cool for speakers that small. Otherwise identical electronics as the Zero, but larger and more convincing when used without a sub. Larger in this case means still pretty petite.

Either pair will then become the best bedroom speaker system or kitchen speaker system you can imagine if you ever upgrade in the living room (this side of installing giant systems, anyway)."
BudgetAudiophile,femq5h5,t3_epd0d8,1579266321.0,"Might have been better off with a pair of just RB42's. Arguably those should beat these for this particular use.

Adding two more RB42's and one RB42C later for center speaker duties is then an option, if one wants to go 5.1 surround. The RB42C should by some accounts have increased the diameter of the bass reflex port vs the RB42 but didn't, so the RB42 without C may just be the better speaker still.

That said, if I had $300 I'd probably simplify even further and buy a pair of Vanatoo Transparent Zero. Come with a remote, are fully powered, with Bluetooth as an option and kick ass sound - and a proper subwoofer out port that has a high pass filter so all you need to do to go 2.1 is plug in any powered sub in them and they stop playing bass and shunt that to the sub."

They wanted to see the encrypted data, I gave them the password to do so. Of course, the content in the encrypted container they can open has to look somewhat believable, ie have a web browser in it that has some browser history, some work documents that look plausible but are really not, and so on.
