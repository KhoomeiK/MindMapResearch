But yes, I think we need to trust in modern medicine. I asked for metformin to get my fasting numbers down. But GDM definitely did feel like my personal failure, even when I logically understood that not to be the case."

T1 diabetes ketoacidocis, and GDM ketosis are different. 

I ate 90-120g/day carbs after getting GDM diagnosis, per my dietician instructions (she was going by latest guidelines in a very large hospital system in US), which is far below 175g per day. I delivered a healthy baby last month."
IAmA,ff5er7f,t1_ff35kc9,1579589738.0,"On a tangent to the Hygiene Hypothesis: because part of our immune system that is supposed to deal with parasites isn't properly calibrated. 

There are 3 main parts of immune system: anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-parasite. All of them need proper calibration through exposure to function properly. We still get plenty of bacterial and viral exposure through infections and vaccinations, but even though parasites used to be ubiquitous, they no longer are. So that whole part of immune system doesn't get properly calibrated in most people. That's: IgE, Eosynophills, Mast cells, etc. So they go haywire in some people. What we need is domesticated parasite strains to vaccinate people against allergies, like attenuated viruses and bacteria we have."

news,ff0pzih,t1_fexjbbl,1579471218.0,"> What is human nature really? Is it just our behaviors? In that case, we can most certainly change. Every action is made by a choice. Every choice was decided.

Eating is in human nature, self defense is in human nature, reproduction is in human nature, things that are found in most or all populations/cultures are in human nature. Bullying is in human nature, because people of most (probably all) cultures engage in it. It is fundamental to our society. As such, we can probably reduce it, but never eliminate. Just like we can't eliminate teen sex, we can ask them to use condoms and birth control, and get checked for STIs, but we can't eliminate teen sex... Also, most decisions are made by our brains subconsciously, and as such aren't really our ""choice"". https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080411/full/news.2008.751.html Unnerving, I know.

https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-origins-of-bullying/

""A 2005 multinational study that spanned 28 countries across North America and Europe revealed how commonplace bullying is and how consistent its effects are (Due et al, 2005). Due et al (2005) used 12 physical and psychological symptoms associated with being bullied to measure the effects of this behavior on the youth in the study. They found that the amount of bullying experienced by kids in those 28 countries varied greatly, with the least severe happening among girls in Sweden and the most severe among boys in Lithuania. However, despite the variation in the amount of bullying, there were no countries where bullying was completely absent....No matter where you go in the world, from the Mbuti of Central Africa (Turnbull, 1961) to Suburban children in the United States (Wang et al, 2009) there are individuals and groups that target others with tactics designed to intimidate, coerce or harm them....Despite the variation in the amount and intention of bullying across human cultures one thing is clear, bullying is everywhere. The universality of bullying across human societies indicates that this is a species-typical human behavior that has little to do with the cultures people live in. Bullying, it seems is part of our normal behavioral repertoire, it is part of the human condition."""

Asthma,fdplk9c,t3_emkarc,1578632017.0,"Short answer - No. 

You are one out of 60% of population with a chronic disease, taking meds for it. Welcome to the club chances are, you will be in it for life. 

What you should focus on is quality of life, and maintaining lung function, not having to take meds twice a day (it's not like toy have to spend hours on daily treatments like cystic fibrosis sufferers). If you keep going on and off of advair and sabotaging your own treatment, you are allowing for inflammation in your lungs to continue, and that can lead to airway remodeling, which in turn can cause COPD later in life. But even short term, you are sabotaging your own quality of life. Ideally, well controlled asthma should not get in the way of your daily activities. 

I take my maintenance inhaler twice per day, then I go about my life and don't worry or even think about asthma. I don't worry about it when I run to catch a bus, when I play with my kid, or when I clean dusty blinds. Why does it matter that you take daily drug, if that's what gives you a good quality of life?"

politics,fdm3bdd,t1_fdl8bq7,1578538805.0,"I actually think it's because education physiologically changes the brain. There has been research on physiological brain differences between liberalsand conservatives, and separate studies on how education changes the brain. I think that education literally changes brain through adding knowledge, making people realize how complex the world is, how much they don't know, and practicing critical thinking, that this changes the brain into liberal brain. 

I've seen this transformation in my husband, who went back to college at 27. Before he was a Republican life his family. Through college he became more and more liberal (despite being in tech, which is notoriously libertarian), and now he is totally feeling the Bern, and in turn convinced me that Bernie is the way."

That's the reason for your baseline status decline - you are allowing for long term inflammation to continue, leading to further lung damage. Getting on maintenance meds stops the inflammation.
