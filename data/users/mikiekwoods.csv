woodworking,fdx68mh,t3_ektzdf,1578765713.0,"""Full"" Blind finger joinery? 

I am looking to do joinery with a desktop CNC that is still strong and without having to rotate workpiece on the edge.

I really don't like the dogbone holes seen in a lot of joinery.  [https://dribbble.com/shots/6077389-CNC-Furniture-Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/6077389-CNC-Furniture-Design) 

But if it is hidden on the inside of the workpiece I think it's much better.

Is there any precedent of making pockets instead of straight through holes? 

Sort of like half-blind finger joints  [https://craftlog.com/us/woodwork/ext-half-blind-finger-joint-box-Nbg](https://craftlog.com/us/woodwork/ext-half-blind-finger-joint-box-Nbg)   
but pocket it on both sides so the joints are totally hidden when looking from the outside.   


I'm just looking to see if anyone has done this, yourself or some resource online I could gleen knowledge before I take the time to test it myself."
