Ps. I would like some people to experiment with their tipping. Tip 25% and see how much better your service is the next time you return. Servers talk. And when we hear/see there is a good tip to be made, we will go a little further to make sure you’re meal exceeds expectations."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff9xr9z,t1_ff9x3pm,1579723799.0,"Most of them don’t get cash on hand. True, not everyone can go pro, not even close. But the system is designed to act like they should be groveling at NCAAs feet for even feigning a notion they can go pro. Student athletes are overworked and forced into an impoverished position. What was the player who won the national title in basketball and his first words were “I’m hungry”. The system is fucked."
todayilearned,ff913e7,t1_ff8zl13,1579702186.0,It used to be but it’s much more standard to tip 20%. It is a fucked system but the cost-of-living has gone up and we’re making a few dollars an hour.  I’m a full-time server and bartender in a mid-sized Midwestern city and 15% is not the standard here.
freefolk,feyusty,t1_feyt48x,1579450793.0,And you will always have my sword.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fewtgdc,t1_fewllw5,1579419233.0,Thank you. I’ve had indoor/outdoor cats my whole life and they often become incredibly lazy. They learn they don’t need their ‘killer’ instinct to survive so the skill and desire to be a predator becomes dull. They want to go outside to bask in the sun or eat grass or scratch their backs on concrete or whatever. My cats hardly leave the porch and just want to enjoy the weather. I think lack of spay and neutering education/availability is a more immediate concern and bigger contributor to damaging environments. It’s like how most Fortune 500 companies are waay more responsible for climate change than we are for using straws. I’m not going to feel bad for giving my cats fresh air.

disneyvacation,fd3jsiu,t1_fd22tvg,1578159001.0,It was actually really wholesome. It was more about setting self-improvement goals.

movies,fcrrndd,t1_fcqxpnk,1577905692.0,"As do I.     

The 70s was full of revenge movies, but also exploitation of women and minorities. I don’t think it’s any accident that a black woman was at the helm of the wheel. I loved watching the ladies fight back.     

I’d be curious to see if female Tarantino fans rank Deathproof higher than  male fans."

And try to find to find sources (or as close as you can) who did witness or experience it. That always stuck with me. Reality it our perception and what others tell us."
