survivorsofabuse,ffaqdtp,t3_esfo5d,1579742040.0,Yo why you so fuckin cool
HorrorMovies,fdsh5xn,t1_fdscvjv,1578702658.0,Don't worry I found it! Someone suggested the La Llorona attraction at Universal Studios and that was it. I want to go so bad now
HorrorMovies,fdscgou,t1_fds4kbi,1578699447.0,Yes! Yes that is it! Thank you so much. I thought it looked really creepy and cool (idk why I eat that short of shit up--ba dum tss). I found a video of them going through it. Thanks again!
HorrorMovies,fdsbwuv,t1_fds6ctg,1578699069.0,Do you have a clue of which haunted house experience?
Advice,fdh8gfd,t1_fdh86fv,1578417656.0,"I have broth, but I know I can't have any solids (the closest I can get are shakes). Luckily the broth I have doesn't have that, but I still feel so hungry. 

I don't know yet :') the endoscopy is to try to figure out what is wrong. I've been having bad chronic nausea for almost a year now as well as very occasional pain. It could be nerves (I was in a bad spot with my type 1 diabetes for a while which could have done it) or really anything indegestive if I could guess"
tumblr,fdga6cw,t1_fdga128,1578386755.0,"Thats true too, sadly. Also you're a known prostitute then it's difficult to get a job when you want to quit. It just sucks because some of those people really thought it was the only thing they can do at those times in their lives to support themselves or their family. 

I just think people need to be aware of signs if they do hire a sex worker; there's often warning signs in plain sight that can distinguish a choice prostitute from someone being trafficked."
tumblr,fdg7z3e,t3_el0rov,1578383839.0,"The problem about prostitutes is that a large portion are forced into it/not allowed to leave once they're in; that's what human trafficking is. I mean, human trafficking isn't always in gritty, heavily-guarded basements; there are plenty of prostitutes on street corners who don't have a choice 

As for strippers or people who sell nudes I mean all power to them, its their life (though I am concerned about some women who get forced to sell nudes, but in ANY regards if its their actual choice it's their life, what can we do about it? Some are just trying to get by)

As for this girl she did something amazing. She shared her body, yes, but she clearly isn't ashamed of that and good on her! Shes saving lives, and why the fuck does it matter how she does it? She did it!"
Models,fdg7jyt,t3_ekvyce,1578383299.0,This made me laugh so hard so many people were duped
gtaonline,fcz11by,t1_fcz0tww,1578091526.0,Yeah but my dad straight up doesn't want the business. He has businesses that actually make him money that he'd rather put his energy into (as well as he has fun with those businesses)
creepyPMs,fcv35pr,t1_fcv2lra,1577993682.0,"Yeah just happened to be the wrong first experience for him, and I'm sure an unpleasant one for you :/ 

Also I'm extremely sorry to hear that. The blessed thing is you got away from that guy. People think that kind of abuse is only done in one way but it's really not. I hope you can heal from that"
creepyPMs,fcv1bcm,t1_fcv108a,1577992598.0,"Send him to a sex club if all he wants is coochie tbh 

I do understand for people with a sex drive that sex is important for them sometimes, because to them it gives a closeness. They can't help that, and I respect that because I respect all specialities. But in that case, don't get with an ace person you know won't want that. Also yeah its the best analogy I can use in these cases honestly"
creepyPMs,fcuzsu9,t1_fcuzd6k,1577991769.0,"Yeah that was super shitty of them imo...I can't stand the mindset that a sexuality can be ""fixed."" Like any sexuality. Gay, straight, demi, ace. It's just sort of a sickening notion to me. 

I'm really glad you feel good with yourself. You're actually a year younger than I am so you've one-upped me on coming out a bit earlier haha! But as long as you're happy with yourself that's all that matters yknow? 

And yes I'm really grateful for my bf. I've never met someone so understanding of my sexuality and my life desires, and he's my first real relationship haha!"
Advice,fcuz2yr,t1_fcuywvm,1577991375.0,"Ah thank you! Yeah she was in college when I was there, but I got to spend a lot of time with her still. I just need to figure out how to contact her and approach it the right way. I definitely understand needing patience though, especially since I'm sure she's a busy woman"
creepyPMs,fcuyv1t,t1_fcuab50,1577991256.0,"Yeah! I've just been out since 2019. I'm not aromantic but I am asexual, and my current boyfriend is very respectful of that (he's honestly a blessing). 

I don't think the people who say its hormones know anything about hormonal disorders because soooo many other symptoms come with that. Also yeah, I know mine may partially be due to trauma, but that's not usually the case? People act like its taboo to not feel sexual attraction but I honestly feel like there's way more people who don't, who maybe just end up conforming? 

Though I do know a lot of asexual people will have sex to please their partner or have children! Its just the attraction part that defines it and people tend to not understand that"
Type1Diabetes,fcttjrr,t1_fcttgzq,1577958769.0,"I hope she realised she needed to take care of herself! And yeah just this girl was a classmate, I don't even remember her name, but i remember that moment and it's just...wow. Something to put in my memoir I guess haha. Its just such a weird sensation"
menwritingwomen,fctszw2,t3_eihnxq,1577957943.0,This one could have been a child ok Dragon Maid lewder
creepyPMs,fctstob,t3_eiiz5p,1577957683.0,"Oh my God Whisper is so full of creepy 40 year olds. Someone told me that because I didn't remember my trauma, I couldn't have the after effects of it nor could it had happened lol 

Another was a nice guy and even used the oh so famous line 

Oh you brave brave soul

Also ace support up here! It took me a while to be able to admit it openly (some guy on r/Advice told me I had hormone problems and was ridiculous because of it so I shut it down for a while) so I'm glad to see you can be open about it too!"
badwomensanatomy,fctsmp8,t3_eire8z,1577957390.0,That's not a woman that's an anime girl in HD
menwritingwomen,fctsk2r,t3_eiurqs,1577957281.0,The fact that a high school teacher commented that is what's really creepy
Advice,fcsu4p0,t1_fcstre2,1577925163.0,"Ah I'm glad to know. I felt a bit dramatic, but now I don't really feel that way as much. My depression had just begun climbing out of an all time low but now that I've been away from my pups I feel it falling again"
Advice,fcp8pvy,t1_fcp8ixl,1577854254.0,"Yeah I guess haha. But there really is no place where people will want to buy it (i live in Podunk and the only thing people pay attention to are yard sales and produce). I've actually tried selling stuff in this area and it never really works out? And it's not a solid thing to tell an actual publisher 

Despite that I may try. I need to find actual good bindings though, but I can't afford to go to writing conventions so sadly that's out of the picture (tbh did not even know those existed!)"
Advice,fcp8fba,t1_fcp89sy,1577853961.0,"The problem is that there's not really a revenue for that in a rural area haha. But its a good suggestion. Its also though that I actually want to get my name somewhat out there, and have something to use as experience for when I get my actual novel finished, as I'm not exactly doing this for money"
Advice,fb932ag,t1_fb92wfv,1576628114.0,Yeah my mom said the same thing but when I went over there I noticed they replaced their gate with a fence (which they aren't actually allowed to do) which was ugh. Luckily we got the puppy back now though! Thank you for the advice
