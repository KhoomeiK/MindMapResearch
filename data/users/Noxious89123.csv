watercooling,ffgsmyn,t1_ffgru7n,1579914025.0,"I'd argue that RTV is formulated for automotive coolant, and automotive coolant is expected to be compatible with common sealants, because that's how many parts are designed to be sealed.

Computer specific stuff is not formulated with that stuff in mind. They are not designed to use sealants, they are designed to use O-rings. Hell, half this stuff reacts with stuff that it should be expected to handle just fine. Spend enough time on the sub and you'll see people with gunked up loops, because of coolants reacting with plasticiser in the tubing, the residues left inside of radiators, and even cleaning product residues that are designed to be used in PC parts.

The cooling systems are also significantly different. One has a tiny deltaT, the other comparitively huge deltaT. One has to deal with (relatively) severe heat cycling whilst sealing parts made from different materials. Automotive stuff also has to handle constant vibration.

It's just not the same.

Instead I will rely on what I've experienced, and what I've seen from running my own system in different airflow setups.

I have a 360GTS in the top of my case, and another in the front. I have a 2600k and 980Ti in my loop.

I tried running both radiators as intake and the rear 140mm as exhaust. I also tried the front radiator as intake, and the top radiator and rear 140mm as exhaust.

The change in deltaT between coolant and ambient air was less than 1°C between both setups, well within margin of error. However, the first setup (both intake) made for internal case temps 10°C+ higher than the second setup (Front in, top ex.).

Needless to say, I stuck with the front intake and top exhaust layout.

The deltaT between the radiator and the ambient air passing through it may seem small, but don't forget that you're flowing a lot of air through it. Even if you only heat up that air a tiny bit, you're heating up a LOT of it, by a tiny bit, and it all adds up.

I think case design plays a big role in things too; obviously the cooler the air going through the radiator the better, but mass flow is very important too. I expect in my situation, I get lower temps with the top exhaust, purely because the total air flow through the case is higher. (Because otherwise I've got 6 intake fans and only one exhaust!)
