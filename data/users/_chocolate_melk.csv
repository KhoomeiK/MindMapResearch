depression,fdrbzjs,t1_fdq3ale,1578682345.0,"Whelp, I'm glad someone pointed out this disorder. I'm BP2, the emotional one. However, it's heavier on the depression side. I too...struggle to have or interact with people. Because I put myself down for being who I am,  and mask it. I am on meds but it's comforting to just isolate myself and paint and draw. Art is my friend. Yeah, I know people in passing but it's very hard to get close."
bipolar,fcrlwkn,t3_eidutq,1577903524.0,Omg how cute. You can definitely do this as a good way to support yourself. From one artist to another good job :)
