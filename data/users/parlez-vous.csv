Generally when you connect to a security agencies intranet (a smaller version of the internet isolated to specific servers only that cannot be accessed outside of the intranet) you do so using your FBI ID and whatever credentials you need to login to the FBI's intranet service. Since they know person X logged in at Y time and viewed this specific document it really narrows the investigation down.

Furthermore, while I can't confirm this is what the FBI does with sensitive documents, most of the time you receive a privileged document it will be filled with watermarks and features that can identify to whom exactly the document was sent by. 

When my company was doing consulting work for a bigger company the scope of work document, budget and contracts all had a semi-transparent watermark with my employee ID which made it trivial to figure out it was me if I ever did leak those documents.
