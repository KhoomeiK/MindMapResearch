Michigan,ff9gjsy,t1_ff98suu,1579712545.0,"It's very misguided, though. It assumes you're not successful until you have tons of money. Imagine we had the strong social safety nets of Finland, for instance. How would you feel being a Librarian? You've got great healthcare, you can have kids and get many paid months off to take care of them, you send them to great schools and aren't afraid of simply living a normal life.

Yeah, you probably can't afford to take wild vacations to exotic locations but you can live that life in peace.

What happens in the US when a Librarian wants to have kids? Better hope you saved up several thousand dollars to pay for it, go back to work quickly (you need the money), be worried about the quality of schools in your area, etc, etc.

Prosperity can be achieved without having that much money if the society we build is more equitable."

Moreover, this isn't a criminal trial. This is a completely one-off event known as Presidential Impeachment. I stand by my assertion that it's insane that Presidents can not only say no but also say no to basically the entire process. Because of our lack of laws around the process, all it requires is a partisan majority in *either* house to put the President well and truly above the law."

UBI has yet to be tested at full nation scale and you can bet your ass that the US will not be the 1st, 2nd or even 20th country to implement it.
