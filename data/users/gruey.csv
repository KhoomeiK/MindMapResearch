Delonte also doesn't strike me as the type that doesn't know something is wrong or believes he's being true to himself. There have been quotes in the past that had more self awareness than that, and while he obviously has regressed, it doesn't mean there's nothing of that previous guy left.

The second part of your post though is true.  We don't know who has reached out and what they have offered.  Like, I believe LeBron has the ability to break through enough to pull him out and put him in a different situation that would allow him to live a better life.

Simply, they believe that capitalist = higher quality and more efficient.

The argument has an element of truth, but obviously breaks down if you really consider the details.  A single payer system can perform just as well as long as you can build in efficiency.  Capitalism can break down when profit outweighs purpose since competition and user choice can't be as true as the capitalist model needs.

So, as long as the single payer system does account for efficiency, adaptability and motivation, then it can easily out perform the capitalist system and can be inherently cheaper."

I think his HOF hinges on either getting a diagnosis of a major mental illness or especially if we get confirmation of significant brain damage, which may not happen until he's dead.  If they find significant CTE, I think he should be a next ballot HOFer and have a specific exhibit set up on it."
Cosmere,felz9u9,t1_feleuaj,1579234810.0,"That's why TWoK has to be a TV series and not a movie.  You have to show the mental breaking of the 3 main characters before they become heroes and if you try to shorten that to fit in a movie, it just won't feel real enough."
Cosmere,felx8vg,t1_feletrb,1579233236.0,"HBO is already in big on the Game of Thrones prequel, so I don't know if they would go for it since the overlap could be significant.  I agree that Netflix seems to go for quantity over quality.   Amazon has the LOTR and Witcher series, but I could see this as a better fit still than the other two.  Apple could be an option, but they're a bit still TBD.  They do have Foundation and Time Bandits, among other scifi, coming up but don't have any big fantasy series, so it could be a good home with big money."

Tech: ""We made this drone so pilots don't get shot down!""

Warmongers: ""Awesome!  Now we can bomb way more without risk of bad headlines!"""
politics,fel7o2j,t1_fel6j9r,1579215830.0,"Especially with these Republicans who will double down on anything the Democrats do.  ""You investigated us for crimes?  That means we can lock you up for crimes Breitbart said you committed!""

Of course, that just means the Democrats need to proceed cautiously.  The Republicans clearly crossed 3 or 4 lines here and will not voluntarily return to non-Fascist behavior.  They need to investigate, prosecute where there's clear evidence and jail where appropriate.  Most importantly, they have to do it as non-partisan as possible.  No spinning details, misleading headlines, etc.  Leave anyone with a semi-open mind believing that the people jailed really deserved it.   Then, they just have to take the fallout.  

It's inevitable if they prosecute, but also inevitable if they don't, so it makes sense to do the right thing.  Just make sure to have the moral, ethical and legal high ground when the Republicans come for you."

OculusQuest,fel3tu9,t3_epqota,1579213466.0,"All games should be cross-buy.  Porting to the quest opens up a new market, and shouldn't be used to double-dip on existing customers. /r

Buying this game now shouldn't be too risky about it not being cross-buy and potentially being on sale for the launch, since the release is scheduled for the 23rd (1 week) and you have 2 weeks to return it if you don't play 2 hours, iirc."
