Intermittent fasting has helped alot with inflammation and swelling. I have a strict fasting window between 8pm and 12noon every single day. I also drink green tea with lemon during my fasts, which may be helping as well. Even before any weightloss was apparent, I could tell within a couple weeks that my swelling was practically gone :)

Edit: plus the vape doesn't smell anywhere near as strong as combusting, so it's fairly discrete like carts :)


Edit Edit: here's the recipe I have written down so it's not really perfect or formatted, so I hope it makes sense, but here it is:

[10] Hot Chocolate

1-2 dirty oily glass vape stems

Fill 2 mugs, one with skim and one with half n half, add to pot on heat 7.

WISK, and when hot, add stems. WISK, WISK WISK the entire time for 10 minutes. Do not let rolling boil, WISK constantly, and if boiling, reduce heat to 6 or 5. 
  
Remove stems, and continue whisking 5 mins. Add 2 packets of Swiss miss, and wisk thoroughly. Serve!

No packaged cocoa?  
3/4 c chocolate chips in a double boiler (just a glass mixing bowl sitting ontop of a simmering pot of water) wisk until smooth and add to finished vape stem milk - BOMB"

In fact it sounds like she was trying to be friendly and invest in being part of/close to her bf's family. I can see myself making a gaffe like that without knowing I was doing something offensive, there's no reason to hate this girl when she didn't do anything malicious.

I often sabotage myself by trying to take on too much change at once and when I can't keep up or it's not ""perfect"" I get down on myself and give up. Starting with committing to the fasting window every single day is great. You get used to this quick, after about 6-8 weeks I never even considered eating after 8pm (which night snacking used to be my worst enemy). Once you've mastered that you can start making sure you're not overeating during the food window - and counting calories isn't such a drag. The calorie deficit is what it's all about. Once you've lost a good amount of weight exercise can help, just don't feel obligated to change too much too fast. YOU GOT THIS 👊

Edit: I just want to add- don't think of fasting as *just* a means to lose weight, because we all get discouraged about that from time to time. Fasting has a wealth of benefits from mental clarity to aiding digestion (helps ibs!) as well as resetting your palate so you more sincerely get to enjoy food when it's time to eat.

It's ok, I'm glad we have each other and the community, and we know there's at least someone out there that believes us and actually knows how bad it really gets. I'm in the midst now too <3 the good news is there's always light at the end of the tunnel, I suppose."
funny,fdclf4l,t1_fdchsbl,1578277813.0,"Right. Words have meaning for a reason, and this implies he doesn't feel like it is ""normally his responsibility"" to watch his son. 

Obviously he didn't mean that, seems like a good loving father, but it's why thoughtfully choosing your words is important - it might give the wrong impression if you don't"
mildlyinteresting,fdc2ibu,t1_fdbztzh,1578265815.0,Once you look at it with this in mind it makes sense.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fdc1wrn,t1_fdbt5o1,1578265479.0,"S a m e. I think my little jerk thinks life is a constant game to see if he can get me to spray him, it's a fun little challenge for him.

relationship_advice,fdb9r2r,t1_fdb92w1,1578255234.0,"Their relationship is 3 months old, this is way outside of her realm of responsibility. She politely attempted to have many serious discussions with him about it to no avail. There's only so much one can be expected to do.

Edit: polite discussions included ""it makes me uncomfortable when you put teddy between us during sex"" ... ""please don't pretend to have teddy grab my ass and tits during sex"" ... just for some insight since you can't read the post. I hate reading benign threads where everyone has their break-up pitchforks out. I'm telling you dude, this guy's behavior was terrifying.

Edit Edit: if you still don't believe me, the hero we don't deserve, u/magnustext copied the original post so you can see for yourself."

relationship_advice,fdb54u4,t1_fdb3ikc,1578253944.0,"Hopefully you read the original post, and are aware that this 25yo ""kid"" repeatedly crossed consensual sexual boundaries with the bear and OP, refusing to have a serious conversation about it, and regularly invalidated her (understandably) concerned feelings.

Obviously a bear delusion/fetish is not the same as alcoholism, but I stated exactly what they *do* have in common in order to demonstrate, in a more familiar way (alcoholism), that there is a problem: ""he's desperate to cling to something most people have no problem letting go of."""
relationship_advice,fdazjb8,t1_fdawcyr,1578252070.0,"This. People who *don't* have teddy bear issues wouldn't be defensive about keeping him around, it would be easy to leave teddy behind for a normal person. 

Dating an alcoholic who got defensive when I suggested he take a break. Said things like ""I really enjoy drinking, stop trying to control me, maybe I could just switch to beer instead of whiskey all the time"" - should be the only indication you need that *there's a huge problem*

He's desperate to cling to something most people have no problem letting go of."

...but should deny the liberty of thoughtful family planning when an unexpected pregnancy occurs, because it builds character.

In all seriousness, no one *wants* to abort. Why don't we (be it philanthropists or the government) fund easy, cheap, and effective prevention?"

relationship_advice,fd7k5xj,t1_fd52qh1,1578205767.0,Guaranteed there's more to that story... I'd bet his parents started to notice bizarre behavior with the teddy and tried to take a stand and failed. All OP knows is that his parents were unsuccessful getting rid of the bear when he was little.
