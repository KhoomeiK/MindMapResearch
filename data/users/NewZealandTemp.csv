McLounge,fdineic,t3_el8pc5,1578446789.0,"I've had 6 restaurant managers in three years at different stores. 

The first one was short tempered but got along with the veterans and people seemed to like him. He was moved to another store that fell apart and has always done badly. 

The second one was fired because he wasn't working his hours, doing his job or communicating with staff. He was a hardass shift manager and then when he became GM he just relaxed and stopped giving a fuck. 

The third was generally unpopular but I liked her, she worked hard, was good at her job but had bad people skills. She got moved to one of the largest stores in the city. 

The fourth is very passive, lets everyone get away with anything but is also scared of her superiors and tries to get us to follow the rules and policies at different times. 

The fifth is someone that is very much the order of law in her store and has respect for her crew, but is also a money saver to the point of suffering in her store. 

The sixth is a nice guy, knows how the stores work and function and will prioritise a store running at full capacity. Very much expects people to follow the rules but knows that it's not always possible. Easy to get along with."
