TalesFromYourServer,fffl02p,t1_ffeh3op,1579886235.0,"Yeah, thats not true. Im a marine corps veteran, and I have always tipped 20% even before I was a server.

I dont ask for a military discount, its pretty useless, but if you offer the discount and they ask for it, then its your job to apply it."

I am very allergic to shellfish, as is most of my family. It might help to find out exactly what you are allergic to. Some people are allergic to all shellfish, some are allergic to only crustaceans or mollusks. Some people are even allergic to other types of fish. The best way to be able to order and eat fish if you want to, is to find out and show your parents exactly what you are and arent allergic to. Allergies are no joke, my shellfish allergy could kill me. So I do understand your parents erring on the side of caution."
ChoosingBeggars,ffe6f0x,t3_et48a8,1579837932.0,"NTA, and thats NOT appropriate behavior. Im a server as a side gig while Im still in school, and let me tell you, as someone who has worked in this industry at several different restaurants for a long time, she was totally out of line. You NEVER comment on tips to the customer. Its not okay, you dont do it, you will get fired for it at many places. Its not mandatory, which leaves people the right to not tip, to tip little, or to tip in coins. How are coins worse than no tip? She could have exchanged it for bills later. 

Honestly, I think this comes from the stereotype that teenagers are terrible tippers and sometimes, its true. Prom season is always a bit rough for us, because we get dozens of huge tables to take care of and they often dont tip us or compensate us for the service. That being said, I have served MANY kids / teenagers who are respectful and tip well. They can be fun to have as customers, and I would never treat them differently or show any sort of annoyance, even if they didnt tip me. Its not right or fair to give teenagers different service than you would give anyone else. In the tipping industry you win some, and you loose some. It all evens out in the wash. You should have talked to a manager, because she behaved beyond inappropriately. Im sorry that happened to you, and please dont think that all servers are this way. You were a paying customer, and you (or teenagers of the age you were at the time) would be welcome to come eat at the restaurant I work in my section any time!"

The problem with people with criminal records not being able to get a job goes beyond this. Its a crappy part of our society, a part that I personally dont agree with at all. I think that if people are going to have a chance at changing their lives, doing better for themselves, and not re-offending, we need to make it possible for them to find gainful employment. I totally hear you on that, and I couldnt agree more. But in order for someone to even have the chance of getting better, they need to be alive.

His wife has set some boundaries, and assuming they have an otherwise reasonable, happy, and functional relationship, he is adhering to the boundaries they discussed and agreed to which is the right thing to do in a relationship. If she doesnt want to meet any of his exes, she probably doesnt want her kids to either. It just seems unnecessary. Why do you need to meet his kids? Dont you think that may be weird for them? Theres really no reason you need to meet them. I think its reasonable. Hes not saying that he doesnt want you to meet them because he thinks you would be a bad influence, or because he doesnt think youre a good person, he is simply operating within the boundaries he agreed to in his relationship. This is his wife. His wifes feelings will and should always be prioritized above yours...hes married to her and coparenting with her."
AmItheAsshole,ff92gx6,t1_ff8ng6y,1579703212.0,"The restaurant also needs to make sure that service flows smoothly for everyone, and they cant do that if servers have tables in several different sections. I agree that they should have accommodated her this once, but she shouldnt expect to have a different server come from a different section every single time so that she can keep sitting at the same table."
AmItheAsshole,ff7y4f3,t3_es5k28,1579661125.0,"Servers have sections, and you were sitting in her section. It doesnt really make sense for another server to leave their section in order to take care of someone in another servers section. It is difficult enough to keep up with your own section, let alone tables in someone elses. And if youre sitting in her section and shes not serving you, youre occupying a table in her section that she could be making money off of. Its not ideal at all. It is rude to move a table after they have already sat down, especially for no good reason, but you may have to start either going on days that she isnt working, or get used to sitting at a table in a different section. I think you made a bit of a bigger deal than I would have about it, but to each their own I guess. ESH."
TalesFromTheCustomer,ff7p2gu,t1_ff7n3c5,1579654888.0,"Usually we dont get breaks as servers. We have a continuous flow of tables, all in different stages of their meal, which makes the job not conducive to taking regular breaks. And its not usually the case that the server is done with their shift either,  because we dont have set end times for shifts. We get cut off of the floor, and then can leave once all of our tables have left and once we have completed our assigned sidework. So honestly, it sounds to me like you just got bad service. And theres nothing wrong with not tipping 20% or in some cases even 15% if you receive bad service, and the mistakes are within the control of the server. 

Your experience at peanut place sounds...awful. That shouldnt happen. That place does get super busy, but their servers usually have pretty small sections. I used to work there. Theres really no excuse for it, even if its busy you should still try to make sure your guests are being taken care of to the best of your ability. Anyway, hope this helps, and hopefully you receive better service in the future."
TalesFromTheCustomer,ff7mkcx,t3_es3ljv,1579653136.0,"I was a server at a national chain (US) and Im not sure exactly what is going on here. I worked at a place that is named after a pepper. If I was your server, I would take your drink order, bring the drinks, take your order, and then check on you multiple times before, during, and after your meal. The only thing I often didnt do is deliver the food, because many restaurants have whoever is available run food to the table so that it comes out quick and hot. Perhaps the person taking the drink order is the host, and perhaps the person bringing the food is a food runner, but either way you should still expect to see your server once or twice during your meal at least. I wouldnt have been offended if a table tipped me less than 20% if I had not gone over to check on them after seeing that their meal was delivered. Your server should be stopping by within a few minutes of taking your first bite. So in short? Im not entirely sure. It could be bad service or it could be a place that does team service. Some restaurants require their employees to share tips, but more commonly your server will be the one keeping the tip minus a small tip-out paid to support staff."
AmItheAsshole,ff62yy4,t3_eroqiw,1579617825.0,Um...YWBTA. It happened years ago. They werent together. Why would you even consider bringing this up now? Just to start drama? Because thats all it would be good for.
AmItheAsshole,ff4v20e,t3_erns1c,1579573128.0,"ESH. You must always cite your sources, even if you paraphrase in many cases. If its not information that is generally well known, and it didnt come from your own knowledge entirely, and especially if its specific information that you gleaned from another source, it needs to be cited. Always. The prof sucks for assigning something that wasnt possible to complete with the provided material, but you should have known that you need to cite your material. That being said, I understand the predicament you were in, and Im glad that your professor chose to handle this on his level and not report it. That seems like the appropriate action considering his own mistakes regarding this assignment."
AmItheAsshole,ff4gq8q,t3_ericew,1579563205.0,"ESH. It doesnt matter who did what, you dont let your child go to bed hungry. Its your responsibility to ensure that she is fed. If he refused to make her something to eat, you should have, because thats your job as a parent. In the future is there any way you could provide your daughter with the help and supplies she needs to cook enough for everyone to eat? Sounds like that would be a reasonable solution. If it doesnt turn out, oh well. At least you wont have this problem."
AmItheAsshole,ff3yc31,t3_eriu3b,1579551522.0,"You should be very careful. If you have ever mentioned to the creditor that you plan on filing for bankruptcy, any debt that you incur after that may not be discharged in bankruptcy. Do you have a lawyer? Im assuming youre filing chapter 7? Where are you at in the process, and where are you getting your information regarding exempt items and purchases? They vary from state to state and federally. If you dont have a lawyer, you need one. You should t go about a bankruptcy without one.  I cant really make a judgement at this point."
AmItheAsshole,ff3komc,t3_erg35i,1579543092.0,"NTA- but these arent the kinds of people that are going to listen to science and reason. They obviously already dont care about what science has to say...so why would they care about what you have to say? They just pull opinions and justifications out of their rear end and run with them. This legislative session my state is trying to run a bill that would make it basically illegal to not vaccinate your child for any reason other than a medical one. You can choose not to do it, but then your child will just not be allowed into any public spaces (schools, daycares, Sunday schools, etc). Maybe they need to implement this everywhere, to keep the power out of peoples hands who do not understand the risks. Its a problem when diseases that were eradicated for decades make a resurgence due to junk science. Anyway, I commend you for being open minded enough to be friends with people with these kinds of opinions...I wouldnt be able to do it. I would consider that an irreconcilable difference in core values."
AmItheAsshole,fen1994,t3_eq1n5w,1579274715.0,"Wow, YTA big time. As a mom to a child with a disability (cerebral palsy) THIS grossed me out. So we should all just hide our kids so that you dont have to worry about your pregnancy? Guess what. Shit happens. My pregnancy was completely normal and healthy until the day my daughter was born and she suffered a stroke. Many infants do. Stroke is as common in infants as it is in the elderly, and it was completely random. She didnt ask to be born that way. She didnt ask for a lifelong disability. And neither did your SIL. The fact that you would exclude her so that you dont have to worry about it? I mean thats really gross to me. I hope nothing bad happens to you. I hope your baby is born perfectly healthy, and stays that way. But stuff happens, you have to accept that, and people dont deserve to be excluded so that you can pretend it doesnt. Being anxious about your pregnancy is completely normal. Everyone is. Its what makes you a good mom. But excluding your autistic SIL because of it is just taking it a step too far. I promise you that in the very rare event that something does happen to your child at any point, you will love them and appreciate them just the same. Your life will not be any less full. So try to relax, and invite your SIL, and try to just love and accept her for the way she is. She cant help it, and she didnt ask for it."

If you dont have to pay rent or buy your own food, just cover incidentals, then you may be able to stretch it. It depends on what you are paying for, nobody can really tell you without knowing that info. I know that for me I would use that amount monthly (or more) for transportation costs alone."
AmItheAsshole,fejz02p,t1_feju0zw,1579189052.0,"Im not even allergic to anything on pizza...little Caesars is just that awful that it makes me sick, without fail, every time. I refuse to even entertain the thought of eating little caesars ever again, unless Im prepping for a colonoscopy or something. I have different severe allergies,  but am ok with most pizza. But you do bring up a good point- there could have been another specific reason (dietary restrictions, preferences, etc)  that they wanted to order Chinese food, and it was ignored by OP.  Usually it could be argued that a person would know of any such allergies within a friend group, but OP seems like the kind of person to conveniently forget."
AmItheAsshole,feiycyl,t3_epedys,1579150663.0,"YTA. Little Caesars is disgusting...barely qualifies as pizza, and leaves me in GI distress for 24 hours. So yeah, I would be annoyed if I gave you money ahead of time after discussing what everyone agreed on (and Im sure Chinese was more expensive than the pizza), you showed up with little Cs, and then probably pocketed the change? No way dude. Give them their money back. They dont care about your girlfriends cravings....they cared about getting what they planned and paid for. And they also probably cared about what the birthday guest wanted, which you seemed to prioritize your immediate convenience over."
AmItheAsshole,feiq9yp,t1_feini1x,1579144526.0,"Its not their job, but its what Ive often done and seen people do when the machines arent coin-operated. Either that, or set the laundry on top of the washing machine they were originally in. I was in the military, and lived in barracks with a shared laundry room for four years. We always just set the clothes on top of the original washing machine or moved them to the dryer (they were free). Otherwise you end up with a moldy washing machine because someone couldnt be bothered to come complete their laundry."
AmItheAsshole,feiq6j3,t1_feind1d,1579144460.0,"Well, the problem with that is that your clothes would then be occupying a dryer, wet, without any guarantee that youre coming back any time soon. They should have just set them on top of the washer."

I dont know where youre located, but Im pretty sure its required at least on some level everywhere that employees  wash hands before returning to work. I dont mess around with getting sick...I dont have time for it. So if I see someone failing to do a simple thing that could keep everyone healthier, Im going to say something."
AmItheAsshole,feimn10,t3_epcofv,1579142087.0,"INFO: are these laundry machines you have to pay for? If not, then they could have just moved it to a dryer. If it costs money, then I dont blame them for taking the clothes out and putting them aside."

AmItheAsshole,fefmlcs,t1_fedf6qs,1579059588.0,"Hand sanitizer isnt the best solution either though, as it can often dry out skin just as bad as soap, studies have shown that some bacteria have or can become resistant to hand sanitizers, and alcohol based hand sanitizers (which most are) dont kill some really nasty viruses like norovirus (stomach flu)...and guess how norovirus is spread? Poop. Anyway, I have no idea how hand sanitizers could dry your skin out less than soap because it immediately dries my hands out to the point of bleeding."

Would you have liked it if you showed up and found out the kid was sick after already having been exposed? Probably not right? Shit happens. I understand you charging a family if they dont have a good reason for cancelling, or they just change their plans, but this was an unforeseen circumstance in which there would have been no possible way to notify you sooner. If I were in their shoes I would find another sitter too."
AmItheAsshole,feds4lw,t3_eognm5,1579018716.0,"YTA. I was a competitive dancer for many years, and when I wasnt competing I was teaching. People who have a passion for dance should not have that held over their head as a punishment. To me, dance was everything. It sounds corny, but it felt like a piece of my soul, dancing was like breathing to me...a necessity. This type of passion and talent should be nurtured, and dance can absolutely be a career! She can always go to college later. She can not postpone her potential dance career. That is what I did. I stopped teaching and competing at 26 because I got pregnant with my daughter, and decided to go back to school. I will graduate and hopefully attend law school in 2021. I still dance for fun, as a hobby, but I simply dont have the time to practice 20-30 hours a week anymore. 

An academic career isnt a safe bet anymore. There are many, many people out there with bachelors degrees who are unable to find employment, or are being paid low wages (12-15 dollars an hour). Let her pursue her passion, its such a beautiful and unique thing. She can always circle back around. If you keep her from pursuing this, she will resent you, and probably try to find a way to do it without your blessing. There are far more productive ways to punish her, or to improve her grades. You could ground her, take away her phone, limit screen time, limit social time, hire a tutor, hire someone to help with her dyslexia, seek accommodations for her at school due to a learning disability, implement mandatory study times, come up with a homework plan....anything but banning her from nurturing her talent and passion."

A gym near my high school had a smoothie shop inside. One day, my friend and I decided to get a smoothie, and sit at one of the three small tables nearby to talk. Suddenly, I see her face turn pale and contort into a look of disgust...I follow her gaze, and thats when I see it. An old man (probably at least 70- I commend him for still going to the gym at all) sitting at a table nearby. When I look down, I see that his WHOLE dick is hanging out of the bottom of his gym shorts, and resting on the metal chair. I have no idea how he didnt feel it, those chairs were cold. We werent sure what to do, so we just ran away. I obviously lacked OPs fortitude. It was so awkward, and my high school self didnt know what to do, I had just seen my first penis and it wasnt intentionally."

It is difficult enough to keep up with your own section, let alone tables in someone else’s. And if you’re sitting in her section and she’s not serving you, you’re occupying a table in her section that she could be making money off of. It’s not ideal at all. It is rude to move a table after they have already sat down, especially for no good reason, but you may have to start either going on days that she isn’t working, or get used to sitting at a table in a different section.

TalesFromTheCustomer,ff7p2gu,t1_ff7n3c5,1579654888.0,"Usually we don’t get breaks as servers. We have a continuous flow of tables, all in different stages of their meal, which makes the job not conducive to taking regular breaks. And it’s not usually the case that the server is done with their shift either,  because we don’t have set end times for shifts. We get “cut” off of the floor, and then can leave once all of our tables have left and once we have completed our assigned sidework. So honestly, it sounds to me like you just got bad service. And there’s nothing wrong with not tipping 20% or in some cases even 15% if you receive bad service, and the mistakes are within the control of the server. 

Your experience at peanut place sounds...awful. That shouldn’t happen. That place does get super busy, but their servers usually have pretty small sections. I used to work there. There’s really no excuse for it, even if it’s busy you should still try to make sure your guests are being taken care of to the best of your ability.

If I was your server, I would take your drink order, bring the drinks, take your order, and then check on you multiple times before, during, and after your meal. The only thing I often didn’t do is deliver the food, because many restaurants have whoever is available run food to the table so that it comes out quick and hot. Perhaps the person taking the drink order is the host, and perhaps the person bringing the food is a food runner, but either way you should still expect to see your server once or twice during your meal at least. I wouldn’t have been offended if a table tipped me less than 20% if I had not gone over to check on them after seeing that their meal was delivered. Your server should be stopping by within a few minutes of taking your first bite. So in short? I’m not entirely sure. It could be bad service or it could be a place that does “team service”. Some restaurants require their employees to share tips, but more commonly your server will be the one keeping the tip minus a small “tip-out” paid to support staff."

Luckily, all of my coworkers are incredibly trustworthy. We could leave our money laying anywhere, anytime and nobody would touch it.

Tell your manager, and then try to catch her in the act if she does return. If she’s stealing, she needs to get caught and learn a lesson. If you’re going to steal from your coworkers, you don’t deserve to work there, it doesn’t matter what you have going on. Everyone needs money for some reason or another, her financial woes do not outrank yours or make it acceptable for her to steal from you. And she stole another servers entire bank out of their book?

When I finally get her down for a nap, I need to take that time for myself... because raising kids that age is exhausting. And that’s just one!! You may want to start being a little more considerate of her now, because that’s going to be one hefty child support payment. Do you know what it’s going to cost you to get daycare services for three young kids? You’re looking at 2,000 bucks a month, if you’re lucky, easily. Easily! My child’s daycare costs more than my college tuition, and it’s not a fancy place. Just average.

If you were able to remove her from the lease without facing any repercussions, that would be a nice thing to do.

AmItheAsshole,fdph6sv,t3_emlazz,1578628527.0,"This is more of a legal issue than an asshole issue. Are you an asshole for trying to keep your child away from an abuser? No. No you are not. However, there are several legal issues at play here. I’m going to assume that you are in the US. There are proper legal channels to go through for you. If you do anything that could be considered illegal, shady, underhanded, etc you could risk loosing custody yourself. 

I don’t know what state you live in, but most states have a law on the books that says that any child born of a marriage will automatically be assumed the child of the man you are married to. Therefore, since you are legally married and were legally married at the time of conception and/or birth, unless another person claims parentage of the child and in some cases paperwork is signed by your husband, your husband may automatically be presumed as the father on the birth certificate. If that happens, your husband will have parental rights, and this will become a custody/ allocation of parental responsibility issue. I highly, highly suggest that you contact an attorney. I highly, highly suggest that you separate before the birth of your child, even divorce if possible. You need to arm yourself with legal knowledge, because this could quickly devolve into a battle for parental rights. You NEED to get a lawyer. I can’t stress this enough. You NEED to operate within the laws of your state if you don’t want to give him ammunition to seek more custody than you are willing to give, more custody than would be in the best interest of your child. Lying about an abortion isn’t going to cut it. Divorce is a legal matter, it takes time, and the chances of your lie surfacing are very high. He will be afforded the opportunity to establish paternity one way or another, if he chooses to pursue it, even against your will...at which point your efforts to lie and hide the birth from him may backfire. In many circumstances, certain issues surrounding custody, child support, parenting time, etc are considered either the right of the child, for the benefit of the child, or are decided based upon what is perceived to be in the best interest of the child. Therefore, they can be done without your permission, against your will, or without your blessing. 

Proceed with extreme caution. Consult an attorney who is licensed to practice family and divorce law in your state. Document everything.  Be safe, but document the abuse if it occurs. Stockpile evidence. One thing that you can certainly do is seek sole custody of your child. Most states prefer a 50/50 custody arrangement, but if you can prove that there is abuse you have a good chance of being granted sole custody. I would consider an order of protection, in your case. I sincerely wish you and your child the best."

Which makes sense, considering the profession, but you need to remember that this is a job, a profession where the work takes place within a specific environment-usually a clinic or office. It is largely the patients responsibility to keep up with scheduling. OP has some issues surrounding abandonment which is compounding this issue, and which the therapist should also be considerate of, but OP needs to keep in mind that this is a patient/practitioner relationship. Either way, OP, you should not respond with “discharged”.

If you tap a car while parking, going very slow, and there’s no visual damage I guarantee there’s no grievous hidden damage either. I do have a bad taste in my mouth about this due to do something that happened to me many years ago. I hit a parked car (doing 3mph max). Someone was sitting in the car. There was no visual damage, but we exchanged info anyway. Next thing you know this dude is trying to claim that I caused different damage that he had on the other side of the car, and that he was seriously injured, blah blah. My insurance company ended up having to pay for 2 ER visits for him...I gently tapped the car at most. He was maybe 30, and in good shape, and completely fine in the 20 minutes that we talked after it happened.

Sometimes I would get dozens of messages each time I logged on, which I’m sure lots of women do, and since I only glanced at each message and profile for a few seconds, something had to stand out. If you are getting first dates but no second dates or interest beyond that, maybe you’re coming across as not being very nice, or not having your shit together.

Until recently emotional intelligence wasn’t considered a “thing” like it is now. Now, there are tests for it, and even some employers screen for emotional intelligence. It is important to be able to perceive, understand, and respond appropriately to the emotions of others. I feel like I can always do that. I can always at the very least TRY to place myself in the other persons shoes and mind, and attempt to take inventory of the situation through their lens. I do this regularly. All the time. Any time I need to make a decision that involves another person. This is why emotional intelligence is important, because lacking it can lead to alienating people, and pushing them away. Ignoring how someone feels about a situation that is very impactful for them, like OPs mother dying, is extremely hurtful, disrespectful, and will cause him to want to shut her out permanently. She is overvaluing her emotions, motivations and desires, and undervaluing OPs. Where OP might have come around to accept her as a step-motherly figure, that cannot happen if she refuses to accept OPs position and feelings as valid, as something that should be embraced and respected. Losing a mother is traumatic no matter the age. My mom is in her 50s, recently lost her mother, and she was absolutely devastated and is still grieving months later. It is even more traumatic for a child, a teenager who still relies to heavily on their mother."

Then, she POINTED IT OUT, and said very clearly what would happen if the juice spilled. That was disregarded. And then, when it happens (due to disrespect and disregard), she’s the asshole? No way. Whether or not it was an accident (and it wasn’t, it was carelessness), in the real world. there are still consequences for actions. Consequences for breaking rules. Shit, there are consequences for accidents. You can’t bail your son out, even if it was an accident, because not only did he know he shouldn’t be doing it but he disrespected a warning. How will he learn, if you don’t teach? While it might be excessive to ask your son to pay the damages in full, I think that withholding allowance until at least half of the total is paid is totally reasonable. It will be a valuable lesson to him."

I’d say it’s pretty normal for people to keep them, if the other party doesn’t want it back. It’s always going to be a symbol of something shitty, you know?"
ChoosingBeggars,fcgs7ra,t1_fcgqvef,1577643551.0,"I moved to the US when I was 10, but I still visit every summer. My grandma lives in Zürich, and I was raised near Einsiedeln. I miss it very much, especially the food! You should go to Migros and have a piece of chäschueche for me :-). 

But yes, I often wonder if stories like this are fake. I can’t imagine what would inspire someone to write a weird fake story on Reddit, but it happens. What kind of teenager wouldn’t want a tablet?"

TrueOffMyChest,fcfx4lu,t1_fcfpdr9,1577634542.0,"Yes....but, side note,  those new ways of finding babysitters scare the crap out of me! I’m not going to hire a random person I’ve never met, online, to watch my toddler with a disability....that seems very dangerous. If it’s an adult-only party I would ask my parents to watch my child, and if my child was sick I would stay at home with her. I’m failing to see how going to a party is more important than tending to the needs of a child you brought into this world."
TrueOffMyChest,fcdd06f,t1_fcd6uqw,1577608883.0,"You should drop kick the parent instead. The child is innocent here. The parent is the one who was selfish, inconsiderate, rude, and thoughtless. I have a two year old child, and if I were to make a crappy choice like this for everyone involved (including the sick child who should be at home), then I am entirely responsible for that action and 100% the one to blame for any consequences. The child didn’t choose to be dragged to a party while sick so that the parent can have fun. The child may not even be old enough to have a true understanding, and is probably suffering due to the poor decisions their parent has made. It may be easier to drop kick a kid, but I think you should try to drop kick the parent instead."
AmItheAsshole,fcd9hhh,t1_fcd6f37,1577607901.0,"I suppose common sense would tell you that rates would only increase if you were responsible in some way for the damage,  but you never know. Thanks for clarifying!"
unpopularopinion,fcd8f1z,t3_edcnws,1577607645.0,"Not the same thing. While I agree that lying about being on birth control is terrible, and it clearly robs the other partner of their autonomy to make informed decisions regarding reproduction, lying about birth control will not cause the other person to be unwittingly exposed to STDs. Condoms protect against several sexually transmitted infections, and therefore I would classify stealthing as worse. Having a child will not kill you. Contracting HIV due to exposure to semen that should have been inside of a condom has the potential to do just that. If we are measuring potential harm, stealthing is worse."

When we rely on tips, it can be easy to just go with it...especially when a gray area exists in which it becomes easy to justify just taking the extra tip. But at the end of the day, you’re the one who has to live with it, ya know? Just follow your gut, and do the right thing. You would appreciate someone showing the same level of honesty and integrity in return. Good luck at your new job!"

If it won’t affect their current or future rates in any way, then I don’t think it’s nearly as unreasonable to pay the deductible. Maybe they don’t know that either."
