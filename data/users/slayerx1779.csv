EternalCardGame,ffvwpnq,t1_ffvoejr,1580275585.0,"All the advice everyone has given you is great.

Basically, the campaigns are something you're going to collect eventually, so I'd prioritize their order based on what cards you're most interested in getting to play with.

If power level is most important, then follow other people in the thread.

Always max your gauntlet and forge ranks as others have said.

Be sure to get your daily win pack. Worst case scenario, it gives you 338 stone, which means you'd get 1 free legendary after opening ~5 dud packs."

Fading Obelisk 1T

Your units get +1/+1.

At the end of your opponent's turn, sacrifice Fading Obelisk.

~~

I went with sacrificing at the end of their turn instead of the end of yours for a few reasons:

1) You don't get punished for extra turn effects.

2) The obelisk can be used for one turn of offense *or* defense (or both, with endurance units), instead of just offense.

It also adds some incidental value if you can find a way to sacrifice it during their turn with a spell *like* Lethrai Lobotomy (obviously the spell would have to be fast, but I digress).

The effect seems balanced, too: it's just a worse Accelerated Impact for half the cost."

It just lends to degenerate decks that are 0 fun to play against, and seek to go around your opponent rather than interact with them; the exact design ethos that eternal tries to avoid."
EternalCardGame,ffvnufl,t1_ffq4akb,1580268539.0,">it's pretty specific

I don't know how much other people like Prideleader, but I love the ever living shit out of him. It's just so good in so many matchups.

It's good against decks built around cursed relics and/or relics, cards like Teacher ensure there will almost always be some number of incidental curses to hit, it's great against aggro for knocking down a blocker and getting some life gained.

When I got my first ever masters with praxis ramp a few months ago, it made me add 4x Call for Aid because I hate ramp that doesn't do anything when drawn late, and it's so nice to have a fallback if my opponent doesn't do anything worth a Prideleader on t4.

Granted, you can still take it out this relic with a Prideleader during your turn, but losing Ambush is a real loss.

Not saying that Prideleader is broken, but it's one of my favorite bits of relic hate, and probably one of the best ever made."

JustBootThings,ffto676,t3_ev0tav,1580225435.0,"I don't want this to sound insensitive, but I can't find a better way to word this, so here goes:

From my civvie perspective, when a soldier dies, it's tragic, but also kind of expected, yknow? Like, it's awful and my heart goes out to anyone who's lost a servicemember they were close to. But it's not *shocking*. I think part of this whole ""Kobe passing away"" this is just how much of a shock it was to anyone who cared about him.

No one expects to be dead, not even soldiers. But with civilians, death isn't on your mind; it's not a risk you're conscious of.

I hope that got across without me sounding like some kind of soldier hating asshole."
