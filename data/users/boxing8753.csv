Well you commented on my post lol, I’m not getting upset just it’s completely irrelevant.

So irrelevant I fact that you have now backtracked from that main point and we’re about 4 changes of conversation from my first point.

Think this conversation had dried up."
facepalm,fgtvi3s,t1_fgtu92b,1581109843.0,"I mentioned practices such as dehorning.

Well you are some random internet stranger from across the world essentially telling me that I shouldn’t see what I have seen with my own eyes scores the country for the past 20 years.

I don’t pretend it’s completely ethical as I have now mentioned 3 times and I have always clarified I was speaking on behalf of English farming.

Again you came here speaking of how farming is bad elsewhere when I was only speaking of England and I never said anything else so I really don’t understand the why you continue to argue this point.

I’m not saying your wrong Just it has nothing to do with my point and you continue to try and say otherwise."
facepalm,fgtsoi4,t1_fgtqdqc,1581108832.0,"I don’t know but that’s different from the argument that sheep should be discontinued to exist because of their wool exhaustion.

facepalm,fgtsfx4,t1_fgtresm,1581108695.0,"I said in my 1st comment to you that their are unethical practices that exist and gave examples of it, I do not pretend everything g is perfect so don’t pretend I said otherwise

I speak from experience when I say that’s not how most sheep are treated, i live in a bloody farm for Christ sake, You can’t convince me otherwise with articles of newspapers from other countries when I wake up in it everyday.

I can’t fathom how you think you know more on this when we have already established you are from America but okay, you can think what you like.

Also the topic was not about sheep farming as a whole. It was about sheep exhaustion and I mentioned it’s not a problem in England, you commented on my post and seem to be changing the topic from what I was taking about and I don’t know why."
facepalm,fgtr2mr,t1_fgtpyi0,1581108221.0,"Yes but these arguments are not valid to English farming as that’s happening in other countries, You commented on my post about English farming so using examples of other countries following unethical farming practices is not a valid argument against sheep being able to living happy lives on English farms where ethical practices are met.

You commented on my post about how ethical practices in climates the sheep can be happy in and tried to use examples of sheep in hot climates that use factory farming.

That is not a good excuse for why sheep should not continue to live happy lives in countries that follow ethical standards."
facepalm,fgtpcd2,t1_fgtov47,1581107653.0,"I’m not a farmer but I live on a farm, I visit farms across England I think I have more than just a snapshot of a view of how English sheep farming is done. To state the obvious it’s clearly you who only has a snapshot of how farming is done here."
facepalm,fgtl0q0,t1_fgtjx85,1581105848.0,"Maybe in your country, the fact you call it ranching leads me to believe you’re from America and that sounds more like factory farming from your description, If your sheep are kept in tight spaces and neglected then obviously that’s bad but that’s not the sheep’s fault due to breeding, that’s your countries problem for following such unethical farming practices.

In the UK sheep farming is very different, I have lived in the countryside my entire life and Im around sheep farming all the time. The majority of sheep farming is very ethical aside from dehorning and such but their are reasons for doing that also.

From your argument it seems a problem with how your country treats sheep not a problem with the sheep at all."
facepalm,fgtd3w4,t1_fgszmmc,1581102901.0,"I live in the uk and the vast majority of sheep are in big fields and it’s England so overheating isn’t really a thing, they are kept in large numbers and fed and watered numerous times a day and are always outside unless bad weather happens.

Where I live they look happy and live many years and are well looked after by farmers.

Hopefully with sane back in training we can go back to the way we used to play in the 17/18 season a bit more as that was the most exciting season as a city fan I can remember.

In terms of sterling’s form I think it’s temporary. His problems all seem to be stemming for a a lack of concentration or confidence not a lack of skill or an attitude problem, footballers form can dip from time to time and sterling has been riding high for nearly 2 seasons now, I don’t think we need to worry too much about sterling. Just keep backing him and he will come good again.

Do you have any idea how sex is initiated, she doesn’t give enough information to go to sexual abuse, what he does is weird but all things considered this guy clearly has issues but to say he is a sexual abuser is a stretch.

Again what he does is weird but we really don’t have enough context, stop assuming things! She never even says if she has even asked him to stop for Christ sake, she says he used to do it years ago there is more to this story than the little info we have been given, stop assuming things and ask questions before making stuff up!

For some reason I can’t reply to the person below me who has said I must be a nonce and be after my own sister so I will reply here.

—————————-

See this is your problem I said what if his parents die as an excuse for why he has been so out of touch and that their may be missing info for what he’s such a Shiite bf. It what’s nothing to do with him touching her in bed at all. but you knew this and it’s seriously ignorant of you to try and spin shit to make me sound like a rape sympathiser.

You take what I said and spin it to suit your agenda and then tell me I should be locked up for the rest of my life.

Things aren’t always black and white, no matter if you like it or not, it’s very clear you can’t push aside your emotions to think about it rationally if you think i of all people deserve to be in prison haha.

What a voliatile and slimey person you must be, yes I have a different approach to these situations and want to hear the full story before judging anyone and because of that I must want to fuck my imaginary sister... what a cancerous attitude you have.

—————————

Editing it again to reply to the other guys reply (the fuck is up with reddit today)

You said I’m excusing his behaviour with no proof of me doing so. All I said is we need more info, how you take that as my sympathising with him I do not know.

I can only think your purposely changing what I’m saying.

Also touching people is not illegal, it may say this vaguely but law does not = morality and no one will convict based on just touching alone, their has to be context to it (just like I’m saying their has to be more context to this woman’s story ironically.... take the hint)

If I pat my dad on his back and say good job, that’s not illegal, but by your definition it is.

All I’m saying is get more info before making accusations, I’m sorry I hold stories reddit to the same standards of which we would need to to actually convict someone, we can’t just go around blaming people with no evidence apart from what you decided to assume from some girls reddit post.

I have no idea how all this means I can’t be in a room with kids, you’re really sick."
relationship_advice,ffwfrya,t1_ffwfegr,1580299395.0,"Thank you for your insight, It’s a complicated issue and people need to stop acting like it’s black and white in reddit posts where barely any info is given, I know it seems harmless but in other scenarios lives can and have been ruined."
relationship_advice,ffweypm,t1_ffweoby,1580298471.0,"There is certainly emotional damage done because of his actions, but to what level? to act like it’s sexual is a joke let’s not beet around the bush. He’s a shit boyfriend who treats his girlfriend like a mother.

From this post it sounds like she can do lots better and is scared of leaving because this life is pretty much all she knows, the abuse seems to be more unconscious neglect than purposeful.

Hence why I’m really hesitant to say anything more because this lady has given little to no info about why the behaviour of her man is so bad, she only tells us how it’s bad.

More info needed but he’s a lazy PoS from the looks and that’s about all we can say with certainty.

The fact I get slated because I don’t jump on the “yeah he’s a sexual abuser” bandwagon speaks wonders for the agenda that some of these people have on here.

For some people it’s not about giving good advice, it’s  about pointing out as many ‘red flags’ they can make up as possible."
starcitizen,ffwdrqm,t1_ffwdo9w,1580297009.0,"To be honest I don’t keep up with the latest specs of these ships no because I will never be buying one outside of earning it in game, and when I can do that will I be bothered about ship specs."
starcitizen,ffwdk8r,t1_ffwdf81,1580296745.0,The scary thing here is I don’t know whether your taking the piss out off carrack owners or genuinely being serious as this isn’t too far from what they say to defend themselves  :s
starcitizen,ffwdagt,t1_ffwcprv,1580296392.0,"Blows my mind is the carrack reddit posts are full of people talking about how their $$$ ship lacks features  and how they should upgrade to this Infamous carrack ship. 

Then they and all circle jerking each other and convince each other and themselves that this ship will suddenly be any different.

Yeah lots of space to walk around, few more guns storage and better shields (ohh and med beds!)

Don’t tell me that having loading bays to store  more ships you have to buy is a positive thing because you won’t convince me, not in this games current state.

All for the cheap price of A MONTHS RENT!

It’s funny how the only things that are actually polished in this game are the thing they sell you."

Reddit’s fucking wild, everyone thinks they know better and just because it pops into your head doesn’t mean it needs to be typed out and sent.

Then after you go on some crazy rant it’s her job to edit and clarify going “here’s why I don’t think my own bf sexually abuses me and I will edit my post to clarify this so you can stop ASSUMING”?!?

Why don’t we speak off what she has said and stick to the topic at hand instead of making stuff up and going on a wild goose chases.

You people must live on Reddit if you think this shit is normal, jeez."
starcitizen,ffwbx0o,t3_evkgxp,1580294527.0,"Hi I was the op in the original post you linked.

I’m glad I made that post because it shows how it stuck with you and possibly helped you keep a level head when everyone was telling you to spend more money.

After I made that post I was swamped with people in denial, I’m not happy that you ended up thinking that this community pushes people to spend money but unfortunately that still is the case.

It’s partly because starcitizen has such a hardcore following both invested both emotionally and financially...

Star citizen is unique in the fact that it’s followers seem not just okay but willling to hand over their money in return for so little, it’s a direct contrast to most gaming companies, I think it’s mostly due to how long this ship selling has been going on.

Spending $$$ has become so normalised and these people are so invested that they have almost become brainwashed by the promise of ‘what ifs’ and ‘eventualities’

It’s sad because they are only playing themselves and they don’t realise how they look to the outside world that can look in with an unbiased view.

That’s why I made the post, because new players get sucked into their cultish behaviour and suddenly you’re in too deep making reddit posts about  how you have already bought the upcoming carrack and it becomes a cycle that these people just can’t recognise.

Edit: I didn’t mean everyone who has pledged large amounts is brainwashed, I shouldn’t be able to tell anyone how they spend their own money."
relationship_advice,ffwbfh2,t1_ffwazev,1580293851.0,"Look I’m not defending the guy at all, all I’m saying is jumping to sexual abuse is very far stretched and disingenuous.

She herself used the word annoying to describe it, she might not be aware of how strange her scenario is. Or you may be correct and their could be more too it.

But without more info you can’t say much more and people should be very wary of accusing everyone off sexual assault because that’s what reddit loves to do."
relationship_advice,ffw9131,t1_ffw6pj1,1580290251.0,"Your twisting the order in which she says things here.

She said after that she refused to have sex. 

Also you need to make lots off assumtions to get to calling it sexual abuse. For something that serious we will need a little bit more than an annoying boob grab.... Christ what’s up with you people.."
relationship_advice,ffw8spo,t1_ffw7zol,1580289907.0,"Very true, but this is also obvious for people who have been in a relationship, unfortunately for the people who disagreed with be before, a 1 page wall of text is not enough to summarise 16 years of 2 people’s life.

We know nothing more about this bloke, for all we know his family could have been killed in a car crash and he has spent the past few years really struggling.

How they think they know enough that they can confidently make such bold claims and instantly know what’s best for this person in terms of her boyfriend being a sexual abuser is mind blowing.

But this persons feelings no longer matter because he grabbed his gf’s boob and is now an abuser.

To both of you who tried to call me out before, I doubt you know much of the real world apart from what you hear on reddit, your both delusional.

This guy is still a dick tho for neglecting his gf’s needs for so long"
starcitizen,ffw8ci6,t3_evjo42,1580289245.0,"Just wait my man, like your said we’re still far was at from persistence, no need to rush and spend money, just loan ships or hijack them for the time being if you want to try out new ships.

Will save your wallet the torture.

Also  all the advice your getting is for the current patch, might all be irrelevant in a few months when things change again, so take all advice with a Pinch of salt :)

I find these posts really hard because people come flooding with advice on which ship to buy spamming ship specs which are likely to be irrelevant in a few months anyway, before really asking if you need to upgrade in the first place, of course it’s your money and you do what you like with it though :)"
relationship_advice,ffw7v3i,t1_ffw6zk7,1580288520.0,"Still not enough info to call it abuse, please read below before getting further triggered.

She says she refused to have sex after, stop assuming what she means and wait for it to be actually confirmed before making claims. she herself described it as annoying. How do you know they didn’t previously agree to sex fucking ( it’s actually a niche kink btw that some girls like) if she only describes it as annoying then it’s possible their is some backstory and should be investigated before wildly throwing round claims of sexual abuse.

I’m the dense one for not jumping the gun and wanting more info before we go on a manhunt over a boob grab?

Their is no fully fledged FPS, it’s still a buggy mess aside from 1 or two buggy missions that barely work.

Vehicular combat is not in the game outside of organising it yourself with other players.

Take what this guy is saying with a pinch of salt because he’s overselling everything and he’s making it sound like these features are fully functioning which is definitely not the case.
