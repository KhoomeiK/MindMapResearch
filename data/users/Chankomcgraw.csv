ReiwaJCJ,ffeo9uj,t3_et2mok,1579857075.0,When did ‘y’all’ move migrate some redneck place in America to everywhere on fucking twitter and now on JCJ? Every time I read it my brain gets a cattle prod shock.
aznidentity,ffajbcd,t1_ffa516j,1579737136.0,"America has been seen in this way all my life. Everyone says it (in the UK) so as a lazy generalisation flipping it to Americans would seem pretty innocuous. Now that China’s middle classes have grown, we get to see they are just as bad as Americans or worse if you believe the views of people from Hong Kong or Japan.  Not witnessed any of these issues myself."
AccidentalRenaissance,ff2xvkd,t3_erd45n,1579528107.0,Gross. Finally releasing his bladder on a crowded train.
facepalm,ff2xs8b,t3_er9n0a,1579528020.0,Only a facepalm if the redaction was added by OP otherwise needs explaining to me.
aznidentity,ff2xhi5,t1_ff2pplx,1579527745.0,"China just plays its power games differently. Economic colonisation of Africa. Subjugation and internment of Muslims. Occupation of Tibet, South China Sea. 

More blatant, less hypocritical than the west. How it behaves once it has full indisputable world power is still in the post."
AbruptChaos,ff2x4t0,t1_ff1b4k7,1579527405.0,Agreed. Looks like they’ve watched too many Hollywood films. Totally illogical response and makes the police look over emotional and thick as pig shit.
WinStupidPrizes,ff2x18o,t1_fexiaz9,1579527308.0,"Your answer fails to answer why the police tackled him. He was clearly a pissed off member of the public calling bullshit on the suspect package. 

Makes the police look like low intelligence gung-ho aresholes"
facepalm,ff2istl,t1_ff240mq,1579508012.0,Seems pretty ignorant and selfish really. Let a cat roam or don’t own one.
facepalm,ff2iqwa,t1_ff23s9k,1579507941.0,Where is that? Never heard of anywhere in the world where a cat can’t go outside.
facepalm,ff2ipz5,t1_ff19yrl,1579507906.0,Keeping cats indoors is unnatural and cruel. So what if they have shorter lives or enter harms way? That’s what cats do.
aznidentity,ff2hvyc,t3_er6wfr,1579506840.0,"This American Life did a good job on debunking the myth:

britishproblems,ff2hnhk,t3_eqzhub,1579506545.0,Well at least we can always just move to Fr... oh wait.
WTF,ff2hfcj,t1_ff1ti9s,1579506265.0,Only the Lord can decide what drugs are legal or illegal mutha fukka.
japan,felbgo7,t3_epkt5i,1579218269.0,Why are they connected in the first place? Two trains can share a platform but is it necessary to hook up like that
Anki,fekcg8u,t1_fejjimi,1579197148.0,So was I but got it now!
Anki,fekceqz,t1_fejscj8,1579197123.0,Great thanks. I knew I was doing it wrong but hadn't spotted that option.
japanlife,fdgwtrj,t3_el7x6w,1578410281.0,Weird how Japan seems to have it the wrong way round. Smoking is banned outside but allowed inside. What is the logic in that? Good to hear it’s changing inside but then where do you smoke?
EntitledBitch,fdetub0,t3_eknvk7,1578346478.0,"Terrible behaviour. Of all the things you could be damaging in the post, damaging gender reveal letters is the one that makes my blood boil. So much so it’s the first thing I think of when this kind of reckless behaviour takes place."
facepalm,fcx4057,t1_fcwweng,1578050242.0,...and electric cars are worse than diesel ones etc...
facepalm,fcx3y6e,t1_fcwqq6g,1578050172.0,Still called rape in the UK. Unless you’re a farmer it’s only mentioned while looking at the late spring colours in the fields. ‘ Wow! The rape looks amazing this year!’ In context no one suddenly pictures sexual rape.
Whatcouldgowrong,fbs9e1h,t1_fbs76p5,1577052061.0,If my friend breaks my ask then am gonna kick your ask
