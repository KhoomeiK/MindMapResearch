Even if the people who contracted the disease directly from the market can be held as having consented to the risk, coronavirus is contagious between humans. No doubt there have been cases of people who have never been to Wuhan, and thus they cannot be held as having consented to the risk. Therefore, the market can be held accountable for subsequent infections from the original party.

Having established that spreading disease is an act of aggression, the government is now enabled to control the spread of the disease. Although voluntary measures should be used when possible, limited usage of quarantines and/or travel restrictions may be justified.

There was no attempt to expand gay rights. There was no attempt to reduce prejudice. All of the republics except Russia and Ukraine kept their laws, and there was no attempt to change that. By the end of the '20s, all of the ""progress"" had been reversed and would remain that way for the rest of the USSR's existence. 

Forgetting to re-criminalize a group of people for less than a decade isn't progressive. The new legal codes under Lenin didn't protect gay people whatsoever- they simply ceased throwing them in jail for a time. Lenin clearly didn't care enough to enshrine his progressivism in law or appoint people who would continue the policy of ignoring gay people altogether. This is the equivalent of calling Saudi Arabia a leader in human rights for letting women drive. Furthermore, France had decriminalized homosexuality all the way back in 1791.

> It's not our obligation to deradicalize people who have radicalized themselves into violence. It's our obligation to defend ourselves from those people. 

The purpose of self-defense is, ultimately, to remove a threat. If we deradicalize someone, they are no longer a threat. I believe that we are morally obligated to pursue non-violent options in favor of violent options when reasonably possible. Thus, if deradicalization is an option, we must pursue it instead of violence. Killing a Hitler-esque dictator is fair, but your homophobic neighbor or a klansman down the block? No, their existence alone poses no threat to you nor anyone else, and the NAP forbids preemptive attacks. As such, unless we are content to allow a future threat and a misguided person to exist unencumbered, we must pursue deradicalization until if and when violence is the only remaining option. Perhaps it will never come to that even without action, but that is still a person we could help, and someone who could be a catalyst for a real threat."

Once someone crosses a certain threshold, the ""misguided"" excuse doesn't work anymore. Once they're actively guiding people to the conclusion they were ""misguided"" to, they're responsible for radicalizing people. 

I don't think many people are that far gone. Even Hitler had interests other than killing Untermensch. Not to mention, it's not impossible to deradicalize people. Although it's not an exact comparison, take the phenomenon of former evangelical Christians and even radical Muslims turning away from their respective faith and eventually beginning to speak out against it and deradicalize others. For example, look up Maajid Nawaz, a former Islamist who is now the founder of an anti-extremist think tank. Also look up Daryl Davis, a black man who befriended and deradicalized over 200 KKK members.

AskLibertarians,ffarof4,t3_eslhs7,1579742908.0,"Placing welfare in the hands of a democratic (although this basically always also applies to dictatorial) government ensures that minorities will *not* receive the amount of aid that Progressive desire to give them.

&#x200B;

Democracies are fundamentally subject to the will of the public and must enact popular policies and abandon unpopular ones (assuming a healthy political system). If helping minorities is unpopular, as it so often is not only among conservatives but the public at large as well, then the government cannot help them. Take a look at the US government's response to AIDS for evidence. The government was largely unreactive to homo and bisexuals dying en masse but rushed to the ""rescue"" when it was revealed that the disease was present among heterosexuals as well. And even then, much of the aid was focused on heterosexual women- i.e., the people who need protection the least. This is another one of the major problems with government welfare. To get support from the public at large, the aid must be very visible, as superficial as possible. Charities have much more ability to provide in-depth aid, as they rely on support from people who are likely somewhat invested and/or informed about the situation.

&#x200B;

And this is the best-case scenario, where the government simply ignores the problem. Depending on the political climate, the government can just as easily aggravate it, as was demonstrated during the 2014-2016 Ebola crisis, where local authorities were frequently non-compliant with international and central government directives. And that was by accident. During the SARS outbreak, Chinese officials actively attempted to cover up reports of the disease. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, any taxes collected for welfare that is poorly used (as it was during the AIDS epidemic) is money denied to private groups who could make better use of it. 

&#x200B;

 To put it simply, the government is unreliable at best in delivering aid to the general public but is almost guaranteed to not provide aid to minorities if doing so is unpopular. Even in the best-case scenario, the government is unable to provide comprehensive aid due to the need to show off to gain popular support."

Coups are extremely unlikely. Three main factors contribute to a coup:
1. Power of the military (particularly officers)
2. Economic failure
3. Regime illegitimacy

I doubt that the city state would bother keeping a standing army, if they aren't being threatened by invasion, so that entirely negates 1.

You choose whatever you believe to be the best combination. That's why multiple theories for what the government should and shouldn't provide exist. Some would prefer being taxed in exchange for a safety net. Some wouldn't.  

&#x200B;

I lean towards negative rights because a preference for negative rights allows the chance for more total rights being fulfilled. If you establish property as the right, you can have property alone or both. If you establish healthcare as a right, you can have healthcare but never property. 

> Aren't poor people who can't afford a doctor unjustly being denied healthcare by people who vote against healthcare related social safety nets? 

That depends. I say no because healthcare isn't a right and thus you aren't entitled to someone else's money to pay for it. Others would say yes, because it is a right and more important than someone's right to keep all of their income."

We as Libertarians focus on the negative side of rights. No one can prevent you from seeking a doctor, but society at large is not responsible for providing you with one. 


It is impossible to preserve all negative and all positive rights- for instance, to provide the positive right to healthcare, the negative right to property must be infringed via taxes. So, we must pick and choose what rights to protect and what ones to ignore.

It's not too much of a stretch to infer that the Framers wanted Congress to have the final say over when and where the military is used, even if the President is the Commander-In-Chief.

&#x200B;

Secondly, we could prescribe a limit to the size of the military. There are two main methods, and we can use one or both of them. The first is to bottleneck the raw amount of men that the military can have, potentially through a permitted ratio of soldiers:civilians. Right now, the US has 4.1 active-duty soldiers per 1,000 people, which on the higher end of the scale compared to other countries. Most other first-world countries are \~2 per 1,000. Seeing as how we have no major direct threats, we would probably be just fine with that bottleneck.

The second is to cap the amount of money that can be allocated, and we could do this by the percentage of the federal budget or by the percentage of GDP (or both). Currently, the US spends 4.3% of its GDP on the military. Most other countries are between 1-2%. We'll meet our NATO obligation and go with 2%.

&#x200B;

The final thing to do is to make sure that the public understands the nature of war. The broken window fallacy is incredibly insidious, and many, many people fall for it even if they aren't aware. We're taught in school that WW2 lifted us out of the Great Depression. Politicians say that reigme-toppling spreads freedom and justice to the people. That soldiers are heroes, fighting to keep us safe from terrorists and others who would do us harm.

&#x200B;

Ask people this simple question: is the economy benefited more by the employment of the soldier or the baker? Most people will conclude that it doesn't matter. But this is, in fact, wrong. Once the number of men necessary to secure the country is reached, any further soldiers are cost without benefit. Not simply in their material cost, but the economy is deprived of their labor as well. If that soldier instead had a civilian job, he would be creating wealth instead of consuming it, and by the nature of capitalism, that wealth would then spread in ever-widening circles. This last bit of information is the single most vital concept in economics to understand. One man becoming employed doesn't reduce the number of unemployed by one. It reduces it exponentially.

&#x200B;

We have now made it more difficult for the President to send troops abroad and halved the available resources to do so, and further made the public see war for the destructive force that it is."

AskLibertarians,ffarof4,t3_eslhs7,1579742908.0,"Placing welfare in the hands of a democratic (although this basically always also applies to dictatorial) government ensures that minorities will *not* receive the amount of aid that Progressive desire to give them.

&#x200B;

Democracies are fundamentally subject to the will of the public and must enact popular policies and abandon unpopular ones (assuming a healthy political system). If helping minorities is unpopular, as it so often is not only among conservatives but the public at large as well, then the government cannot help them. Take a look at the US government's response to AIDS for evidence. The government was largely unreactive to homo and bisexuals dying en masse but rushed to the ""rescue"" when it was revealed that the disease was present among heterosexuals as well. And even then, much of the aid was focused on heterosexual women- i.e., the people who need protection the least. This is another one of the major problems with government welfare. To get support from the public at large, the aid must be very visible, as superficial as possible. Charities have much more ability to provide in-depth aid, as they rely on support from people who are likely somewhat invested and/or informed about the situation.

&#x200B;

And this is the best-case scenario, where the government simply ignores the problem. Depending on the political climate, the government can just as easily aggravate it, as was demonstrated during the 2014-2016 Ebola crisis, where local authorities were frequently non-compliant with international and central government directives. And that was by accident. During the SARS outbreak, Chinese officials actively attempted to cover up reports of the disease. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, any taxes collected for welfare that is poorly used (as it was during the AIDS epidemic) is money denied to private groups who could make better use of it. 

&#x200B;

 To put it simply, the government is unreliable at best in delivering aid to the general public but is almost guaranteed to not provide aid to minorities if doing so is unpopular. Even in the best-case scenario, the government is unable to provide comprehensive aid due to the need to show off to gain popular support."

AskLibertarians,fey4f6f,t3_equivd,1579440746.0,"A single city-state will never be a military powerhouse in modern times. If a superstate is dead-set on invading them, it would be very difficult to prevent. 

So, what they should do instead is focus on making it as pointless and expensive as possible for the invader. Assuming that the invader wants to capture the city more or less intact, that makes a perfect battleground for urban militias. If there are mountains or otherwise harsh terrain, rebels can hide there. City states could form a defensive pact against a potential invader. They could seek protection from a rival superstate (like Taiwan has done). 

 I don't think there'd be too much of a gang problem. People join gangs because they can't do anything else. That shouldn't be a problem within the city state, as there's no minimum wage or other labor restrictions. There's also no or very niche black markets for them to exploit anyway, so there's simply no money to be made. 


Coups are extremely unlikely. Three main factors contribute to a coup:
1. Power of the military (particularly officers)
2. Economic failure
3. Regime illegitimacy

I doubt that the city state would bother keeping a standing army, if they aren't being threatened by invasion, so that entirely negates 1. So as long as the current leader isn't a complete madman, they should be very resistant to being overthrown. Autocratic, authoritarian strongmen deal with coups, not liberal democracies, and certainly not wealthy liberal democracies. Allowing for the leader to be dismissed from office further reduces the threat."

You choose whatever you believe to be the best combination. That's why multiple theories for what the government should and shouldn't provide exist. Some would prefer being taxed in exchange for a safety net. Some wouldn't.  

&#x200B;

I lean towards negative rights because a preference for negative rights allows the chance for more total rights being fulfilled. If you establish property as the right, you can have property alone or both. If you establish healthcare as a right, you can have healthcare but never property. 

> Aren't poor people who can't afford a doctor unjustly being denied healthcare by people who vote against healthcare related social safety nets? 

That depends. I say no because healthcare isn't a right and thus you aren't entitled to someone else's money to pay for it. Others would say yes, because it is a right and more important than someone's right to keep all of their income."

We as Libertarians focus on the negative side of rights. No one can prevent you from seeking a doctor, but society at large is not responsible for providing you with one. 


It is impossible to preserve all negative and all positive rights- for instance, to provide the positive right to healthcare, the negative right to property must be infringed via taxes. So, we must pick and choose what rights to protect and what ones to ignore. 

Because observing negative rights empowers you to fulfill the positive rights for yourself, I think that's the best system.

AskLibertarians,felo7kw,t3_ept6i5,1579226892.0,"First, we have to get Congress to actually do their job and stop letting the President do whatever they want with the military. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to declare war, govern the military, and raise money to pay for it. It's not too much of a stretch to infer that the Framers wanted Congress to have the final say over when and where the military is used, even if the President is the Commander-In-Chief.

&#x200B;

Secondly, we could prescribe a limit to the size of the military. There are two main methods, and we can use one or both of them. The first is to bottleneck the raw amount of men that the military can have, potentially through a permitted ratio of soldiers:civilians. Right now, the US has 4.1 active-duty soldiers per 1,000 people, which on the higher end of the scale compared to other countries. Most other first-world countries are \~2 per 1,000. Seeing as how we have no major direct threats, we would probably be just fine with that bottleneck.

The second is to cap the amount of money that can be allocated, and we could do this by the percentage of the federal budget or by the percentage of GDP (or both). Currently, the US spends 4.3% of its GDP on the military. Most other countries are between 1-2%. We'll meet our NATO obligation and go with 2%.

&#x200B;

The final thing to do is to make sure that the public understands the nature of war. The broken window fallacy is incredibly insidious, and many, many people fall for it even if they aren't aware. We're taught in school that WW2 lifted us out of the Great Depression. Politicians say that reigme-toppling spreads freedom and justice to the people. That soldiers are heroes, fighting to keep us safe from terrorists and others who would do us harm.

&#x200B;

Ask people this simple question: is the economy benefited more by the employment of the soldier or the baker? Most people will conclude that it doesn't matter. But this is, in fact, wrong. Once the number of men necessary to secure the country is reached, any further soldiers are cost without benefit. Not simply in their material cost, but the economy is deprived of their labor as well. If that soldier instead had a civilian job, he would be creating wealth instead of consuming it, and by the nature of capitalism, that wealth would then spread in ever-widening circles. This last bit of information is the single most vital concept in economics to understand. One man becoming employed doesn't reduce the number of unemployed by one. It reduces it exponentially.

&#x200B;

We have now made it more difficult for the President to send troops abroad and halved the available resources to do so, and further made the public see war for the destructive force that it is."
