I'm not saying you need to stop talking to him. But, as someone who frantically worries and texts when people don't reply sometimes, I do think it might be worth cooling it a bit. If he doesn't text back right away, just leave it a bit. (I mean, if he doesn't reply for the whole day, you might wanna check if he's all good.)

Edit: I just noticed you mentioned about playing around. What do you mean here? Men don't tend to communicate in the same way we do, in general. I don't think the fact that he doesn't talk about it means he's completely fine with it, whatever it is."
relationships,fdq9wdq,t3_emmhe3,1578660611.0,"Personally, I'm sorry but I don't see it as anything to worry about at the moment. It could be him cheating, but it could also be him liking female attention. Not necessarily in a romantic or sexual way, it's just that guys, in general, tend to act differently to women. They're more open with things. I'm sure he still does care about you. 

Having said that, maybe he does like the attention. You don't know if he sent any nude photos back.

Why were you in his gallery and chats anyway? I'm sorry, I know this sounds a little like I'm landing on his side. I'm not on anyone's side, I just find it a little weird that you were scrolling through his gallery and conversations, and then brought it up to him in an argument. If my boyfriend had been through my phone when we were together, I'd be furious.

Maybe you could ask him if there's anything he feels he isn't getting from you, or from the relationship. I would suggest sitting down with him, not as an argument but as a healthy, non-heated discussion, and tell him what specifically makes you uncomfortable. Ask him if there really is anything going on here."
