AskReddit,ffbtdbt,t3_esi1iu,1579782035.0,"Former Blockbuster employee. Netflix was doing pretty well in the mail DVD department, but probably realized they were losing too much money in theft and damages, so the genius who decided to make it a streaming service caused it to starting to take hold. The BB corporate big dogs were getting other jobs or retiring and I'd had enough 60 hr weeks as a shift manager because no one else would work. Was looking for another job and my store manager threatened to fire me, so I just said well have fun trying to cover my next few weeks schedule because I quit. Never went back, within a year they started closing stores and tbh I think the store I worked at was one of the last to go. It wasn't a terrible job, but the quotas on trying to push online rentals was probably the downfall. If they would have given people free rentals for a week, instead of get a free movie rental after you sign up and rent 4 movies, they might have been able to compete. We could be watching Blockflix or Netbuster."

Methadone,ffbqrrx,t1_ffa8a4x,1579778974.0,"Man, that's tough, but all the signs are there from what I've been reading. If she doesn't have a problem testing for methadone (some clinics test you so you can get take homes so you don't have to go to the clinic everyday, you can piss dirty and still get methadone, but you have to go everyday), she should just do that for you. If you are just concerned for her and she flips the script blaming you for ""not wanting to do a drug test for you because she has to do them already and it gives her anxiety"" is just a way to make you feel bad so she can continue to live the way she wants. I'd have a heart to heart with her and if she starts backpedaling and giving excuses it's probably best to worry about you from then on. This is from my experience, I wish you the best. Also, I cut ties with all my old dealers and honestly they were good friends, but I couldn't do that middle manning again or I'd use, so her still buying stuff for friends is a HUGE sign, 30 minutes in the bathroom everytime after you help out her ""friend"", she's looking for veins or smoking whatever she's getting."

His Mom told me to just bring him to the house and she'll take him because they didn't have insurance. He ended up passing out from blood loss and luckily saw an ambulance parked at a McDs just inside town and I pulled in there and ran up to the ambulance telling them what happened. They got him up while getting his head worked on, but I guess that caused them to have to file bankruptcy because it was the last straw on the camel's back.
