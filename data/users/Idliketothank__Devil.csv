G80 is a locker, the rest I forget. Keep the 4 speed, if it's the m465, best tranny they ever made.  You can find old auxiliary OD units that bolt on the back, which are great for 373 and 410 setups. 3.08 not worth bothering adding it.  Quite often half tons had 308 or 276 gearing.  If it's a dog, often it's not the motors fault, it's eighties fuel miser logic.  308 is okish with a strong motor. 276 and and a lower HP 350 or 305 is just boat anchor crap.  People often blame the 305 when it's really the gearing"
ChevyTrucks,fe3fmuh,t1_fe2o5fn,1578848821.0,"Ive had some luck just finding them lying around. The ring gear and harmonic is the tell, they're different and not interchangeable with the ones from other small blocks.  They're not sought after like 327s or 283s, no good for hot rodding or high revving.  They're definitely rarer but not pricy, kind of like the 366 that way."

Not much worse on gas than a strong 350 if you're just doing highway speeds anyway, as long as it's a 60 mph highway.  Lot of guys over carb 454s, they only need a 600 cfm if your redline is below 6000 rpm, which, it is."

I did that to one years ago, and the extra torque of the 400 (It wasn't a hot rod motor, it was designed for towing) let it pull red line in overdrive.  It was a very fast truck, as far as top speed, not the quickest though.  the 305 it had before kind of ran out of steam around 95 mph."
