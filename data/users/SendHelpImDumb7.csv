paramotor,fdv4ako,t3_emw2w4,1578743060.0,"People dont seem to be answering the question, the cheapest you can start for is around £2000 maybe even £1500 for a second hand paramotor and wing with no training.

I did this and have not died and only 'had to lay her down' 2 or 3 times on takeoff whilst teaching myself.

This is not the way you should do it though for the following reasons:

~You do not know the air worthiness of the machine 
~It is very easy to fly one of these in the same day you buy it without lessons BUT you dont know the small mistakes you're making nor do you know what to if it goes tits up.

But fuck if you buy one and learn with it very slowly (I mean months of looking stuff up) in my own opinion I think it's fine as I've done it myself and an instructor says I fly fine.

TLDR: How much?
         ~Free if you win a prize
         ~£2k If you are not stupid OR you don't care
         ~£5k+ If you want gear and instruction"
