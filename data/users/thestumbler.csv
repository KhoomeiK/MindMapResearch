dndnext,ffmg6q0,t1_ffk2iq3,1580054239.0,Seconded. I have a 2 month old right now and this would really upset me if it just popped up in a game. It would just be too much for my sleep-deprived new-parent never-loved-something-so-much imagination. If my DM asked I would just politely say I rather he not.
IAmA,ff2znhr,t1_ff2rsnp,1579529673.0,Very sorry to hear that. How old is the scar? r/skincareaddiction may be able to give you some tips on helping it fade. I know bio oil is a common recommendation (I'm about to try it for an unsightly scar of my own).
aww,fcvvgeo,t1_fcvub8h,1578011006.0,Lol okay bye
aww,fcvt70l,t1_fcvrr24,1578009550.0,"I have had several kittens in my life, including 2 long haired kittens. When they occasionally get poop on their butts (which my current cat still does, on occasion), I find it is pretty noticeable and wipe them down with a baby wipe. You sound like you are speaking from experience -- do you find this to be difficult? Maybe your cat has it worse than mine. If that's the case and you are worried about T. gondii you can keep your kitten inside."
aww,fcvqy23,t1_fcvq236,1578008099.0,"If you let your kitten walk around with literal poop on their butt for DAYS you are a bad cat owner imo. That said, I won't argue that there aren't a ton of bad (or at least unprepared) cat owners out there."
aww,fcvovgu,t1_fcvip73,1578006775.0,"Cats licking their butts is not a means of transmission for T. gondii. The parasite needs a few days after it is shed in feces to become infectious. If you change the litter box every day, stepping in its own poop is also not a means of transmission."
aww,fcvoetl,t1_fcvdukx,1578006488.0,"Not quite. T. gondii is only infectious after a few days in the poop. Unless kitty is walking around with the same poopy butt for days, that is not a means of transmission."
aww,fcvcfzq,t1_fcvbex1,1577999186.0,"T. gondii is transmitted via cat feces. The risk of infection is from interacting with cat poop, not a cat. Unless this baby is changing litter boxes, they are in the clear.

Edit: Damn, a lot of vitriolic comments, all in the same vein... I feel like y’all are really overestimating the chances of transmission of T. gondii from a cat. Cats are only infectious for 1 - 3 weeks after contracting the parasite, which they themselves get from eating other animals. During this infectious period, they pass the parasite through their poop, which does not itself become infectious for 1 - 5 days. If you are worried about T. gondii infection, you can keep your cat indoors or change your litterbox everyday. Some people act like touching a cat will kill you, jeez."
clothdiaps,f7op0i7,t3_dx76ld,1573931233.0,"This is also drives me nuts. I understand the ""logic"" of it being because there are ""rare"" prints... but, it's a diaper! I see people trying to sell them for MORE than the brand sells new + shipping (when shipping would be free from Amazon). I scoured FB groups for like 2 months (and still am checking, to be honest) and found a few good deals, but usually they go very fast. I ended up getting one lot of pockets used for a good deal and have bought the rest new. Like other people are saying, if it is used I want 40 - 50% off retail, otherwise I can just wait for a sale.

The exception I've seen to the absurd used-diaper market is with inserts. You can get inserts for a lot cheaper used than new. I've gotten a handful of hemp and bamboo inserts this way, and I'm keeping my eye out for more for when I'll need to double/triple up."
