Anubisath defenders are statistically one of the weakest cards in the deck.  They are only really strong with force of nature.  I replaced mine with faceless corrupter.

The priest matchup is almost hopeless even with soul of the forest.  2 seems like a lot to begin with I don’t play any, but I sometimes think a single copy would be good.  I also play dream way guardians.  The deck feels like it needs more token cards in the early game, and they are amazing against aggro decks.

hearthstone,fdya6c1,t3_en6vpj,1578777669.0,"1. Descent of dragons.  This expansion has been an absolute blast to play.  The galakrond mechanic is the evolution of the Cthun mechanic.  It has been slightly overtuned, but it is well designed and fun to play.  The rest of the cards have been very fun to play as well
2.  The league of explorers.  The developers learned a lot from this expansion.  It introduced the discover mechanic which is arguably hearthstones most well designed mechanic
3.  Journey to ungoro this was a major step forward for hearthstone.  The introduction of 2 class legendary removed tons of junk legendary neutrals.  The quests were very innovative, but the majority of them were Not very well designed.
4.  Rise of shadows.  Tons of fun cards, and it introduced the lackey mechanic.  The quests were better designed this expansion in my opinion other than the shaman quest.  I think the quests are at their best when the completion requirement and the reward aren’t too synergistic.  Edit: not sure why I thought the quests were in the expansion
5.  Knights of the frozen throne.  Hero cards are some of the most interesting and fun cards in hearthstone, and the death knight cards are no exception.  Some of the DKs are considerably more powerful than the rest.  Jaina, guldan, and Rexxar smoke the other dks, and they will be very powerful in wild for most likely as long as the game exists.  My theory is that this expansion was originally designed as an adventure, and was then transitioned to a full expansion.  The set has a lot of filler cards, and some of the legendaries have odd design choices.  

Honorable mention: whispers of the old gods.  I have major rose tinted glasses for this expansion.  There were some awesome mechanics introduced, but it suffers from some of hearthstones old design philosophies.  Only 1 class legendary means there are tons of junk neutral legendaries. I would love to see this expansion release using hearthstones current design methods

CompetitiveHS,fdocr40,t1_fdoay6z,1578602789.0,"You know what I am talking about, but you disagree with me.  Of course secret paladin won by playing mysterious challenger and all of the benefits you listed, but it had a great mana curve that lead up to a very high tempo on curve play at turn 6 followed up by turn 7 and turn 8 plays.  I suppose odd paladin isn’t as good of an example, but it can make great on curve plays and completely blow out the opponent.  Mech paladin is a decent standard deck and one of the most busted wild decks at the moment.  

What win condition would you like to see?"
CompetitiveHS,fdob3y8,t1_fdo374x,1578601995.0,"I’m not sure reborn paladin even wants the benefits of pure paladin.  They don’t need to play a true silver in the middle of the game, and they don’t need the value of the cards generated by the 7 mana 7/7.  The value is built into the constant copying of reborn minions."
