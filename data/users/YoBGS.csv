speedrun,fe8li16,t3_enufrp,1578927549.0,"Hey since audio quality has been mentioned I wanted to chip in something else I thought of - Why should I care?   


I mean that in the nicest possible way. I love speedrunning news, and if someone gets a 19s WR that's a great story, but it leaves me with questions. Was it a new skip or better execution that led to the time? What does this mean for the game/run/category? The concept of doing speedrun news fast is a really cool one, but make sure to keep some flavor text in there so people know \*why\* the runs are important. Otherwise it's just reading a bunch of numbers without a ton of context.   


Great idea, look forward to the next ones!"

speedrun,fdnn3lc,t3_emc7o2,1578589231.0,"Another reason it’s rough is that a ton ends up going into the production end of things to try and play catch up when a lot of runs go late.

Like I know people feel whatever way about the hosts/donation readers but there’s a lot that goes into it that is helpful. When you have less time to remind people of upcoming incentives or prizes that they may not be thinking of, it’s possible that fewer of those incentives get met.

Then again, if everyone goes 15 minutes under their estimate then the schedule gets super lopsided the other way. I just chalk it up to the logistics of this have to be super hard."

worldnews,fddl7ae,t1_fdd2rv7,1578316512.0,"Yeah, like I said it wasn’t geared toward him in particular, more the nature of discourse in general. People call their other side horrendous names, then seem shocked when folks don’t change their opinion in the end.

It’s hard enough for people to admit they were wrong. When they do they don’t need you calling them a “retard” and stuff like that on top of it."
worldnews,fdd1jwt,t1_fdd19go,1578291126.0,"I don’t think calling people names like that is going to change their mind. 

I mean I’m sure you’ll get mad at me now, and that’s fine. I’m just bummed that everyone is so inflammatory in general, like being mean to someone isn’t persuasive.

I just know I don’t want to see people hoarding strats to make a better showing at a tournament. We’re finally seeing a growth in content that isn’t just “I’m live streaming runs.” People are making tutorials and general content that makes speedrunning more accessible, but hoarding makes all of that go away, which would be disappointing."

AskReddit,fc6jwej,t1_fc6bsg2,1577482330.0,"There are not only instructions on the side of most machines, but the instructions have picture diagrams that show the posture and stuff you should have. 

If you’re not sure about a machine or station, and too nervous to ask, just keep an eye out because eventually youll see someone using it. 

Ultimately most things are meant to be intuitive. The reason 90% of people on muscle confusion end up there is because like, okay, here’s an example:

There’s a machine with a seat that has a back and a bottom. When you sit in it, you see two handles about chest height hanging from a hinge above you that move so when you pull them your hands touch in the middle and the weights are pulled up. Makes sense?

Muscleconfusion people decide that means put your head on the seat and use your butt muscles to pull the handles with their feet."
