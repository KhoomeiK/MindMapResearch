aww,fe3jyc9,t3_ennpgp,1578849944.0,Great for short term but it’s going to take a long time for the bush to grow back enough to sustain the animals.
entitledparents,fe2zoj6,t3_ennkxa,1578844536.0," THIS IS SO MUCH BULLSHIT. 

The incident happened yesterday, on the weekend, and already 1 cop is fired, a woman identified and found, OP parties in a completely different city, two lawyers retained, court happening the day after the incident also on a weekend, woman already found guilty of multiple charges, sentenced, resentenced and fines determined.

If she had any idea how many feral kittens die in agony from starvation, disease, and infection she might not be so quick to call ear clipping inhumane. Letting the cats continue to breed and suffer the consequences is far more cruel. And they are not “her” cats.

NTA. You’d be doing the right, humane thing in TNR, which is why vets do it for free. Because it’s by far the less cruel option."
