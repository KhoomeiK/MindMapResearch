Every now and then there pops out a scientific article which talks criticly of these oversimplified views, but the sheer amount of false data makes it seems like it's the one that is false.

This isn't to say that one should ignore all these blogs etc. After all, they may have tried some things, such as supplementation regiments, that indeed may help someone. In fact, I'm trying some of these things, but I always take it with a pinch of salt. Again, it's YMMV thing so one shouldn't completely discredit it."

I now see why people prefer these simplified terms.

Just kidding, I get what you're saying. :-)

> If you aren't showing what pathway is affected and explain where these things came from it is just a load of bullshit.

Yeah, that's just what I was thinking. The way it's done, it looks like a horoscope or some kind of astral prediction, like where the hell are they pulling this information from. They seem to have very specific statements, like ""having calm demeanor, but tense inside"", but this is all false certainty...again, like a horoscope. :-D

Justa bunch of random statements, that's what is is. Even if there is some amount od truth to it - and there probably is because these terms exist in themselves - it's obscured by the sheer amount od fabricated ""facts""."
MTHFR,fgld6cs,t1_fgjpcv5,1580891718.0,"> And yet they do (for some people). That's the best proof that it isn't BS.

I know, I was just being a bit provocative. ;-) I've recently started taking it (200 ug for starters), and I must admit it makes me feel a bit ""weird"" and maybe slightly ""wired"", I can def feel it doing something in my body. The feeling lasts for about an hour after taking it.

I think it's because these methylated things bypass the rate limiting step of production which body uses to regulate it's amount - and sometimes badly when enzymes don't work properly. Reminds me of 5-HTP, which is a precursor to serotonin. When I took it, I also felt ""something"", and if I took ""too much"", I'd felt weird and dizzy. So indeed we need to be careful when we decide to bypass the body's regulation mechanisms, because with it bypassed, there'y nothing to protect us from having too much of something. This is just my speculation / intution on it, do you think this makes sense?

Edit: I've seen that Deplin, which is basically an expensive, fancy, and branded form of L-methylfolate, contains 15mg of L-methylfolate. That seems like an absolute overkill, and can even be harmful in the context of overmethylation. Yet they claim it's well tolerated by patients. That may be so for majority of people, but I still think they are pushing it too far because some people have very bad experiences with it, i.e. they are ruining it for at least some percent of people. It's just crazy how this lacks even a basic common sense and I think it's all done in a mentality of ""Here, we have 100x more active ingredient than a generic counterpart! We're not cheapskates like them!"". Just crazy...


> Like Astald said, under/overmethylation aren't the terms to search for when looking for scientific papers. More fitting terms for it would be S-adenosyl methionine, one carbon cycle and the like

MTHFR,fgitw69,t1_fgg5870,1580830811.0,"I think it's not only that you're supersensitive, but it's possible that Deplin contains too large a dose. RDA for L-methylfolate is 400 ug and most pills contain that amount. I just bough generic L-methyfolate and will try taking it. Also, some people say that 200-400ug was enough for then to obtain benefits. So, is it possible that Deplin contains what is actually an unreasonably large dose, which causes side effects with some people?

I'd say, just buy a generic but good quality L-methylfolate, and go from 200 ug upwards."

So it's tempting to think that an antidepressant has ""screwed me ip"", but the thing is, I wasn't right to begin with, and antidepressant helped a great deal.

It's nice to think there are alternative theraphies, such as psilocybon, that work well but the question is, even if they do work, how sustainable are they? E.g.

Worst thing is, my psychiatrist does not believe this is due to withdrawal and has sent me to see a cardiologist.

However, even doing it like this I developed tachycardia (went to the ER) and was put on beta blockers for the time being. It scared the living shit out of me.

But before I tried to do it cold turkey, many times, and I was always struck with withdrawal so nasty that I had to go back.

Bottom line: Do some kind of quick taper. Get yourself a diazepam, and slowly reduce the dose over at least 1-2 weeks. It's not that long of a time and you'll spare yourself a whole bunch of trouble. Look up Ashton manual if you want to get educated about the specifics."

I also have this issue where I'm in a bad mood, fatigued, feel like my life is all going wrong, but have a hard time understanding why it is so and most of the time I don't know what to say.

I'm very much intimate with that ""feeling like I have to take it"" situation. It sucks. And the bliss goes away soon, like 2 months top if you use it daily, so really no point in trying to hold onto it, trust me. And when the bliss goes away, it's replaced by feeling grumpy and resentful when not medicated. Then you begin to take it just to feel OK. That's my current state in fact, and it arose not from abuse but medical use (support to antidepressant)

Edit: About tapering, go see my previous post about Xanax WD, dosages are comparable and there's a guy with a silver medal who's been super helpful.

Edit2: If you want a blissful feeling tbat isn't harmful or dependance forming, try CBD. It works for me. CBD oil / smoking or vaping CBD buds, CBD hash.. there are a lot of forms that have slightly different effects and duration, but CBD oil is most potent I'd say. I currently experiment using it to ease the withdrawal, it seems to have some good effects in regards to that.

Have you ever used cannabis or CBD to easen the withdrawal, or just to bring some enjoyment to life while undergoing it?

Thing is, yesterday I was hit by an interdose withdrawal and I happened to smoke some CBD bud (no THC basically), and it made me feel like I could chill and actually be happy and more at ease; I wasn't pressed to take another pill. I used to smoke a shit ton of it, and when I think about it, my Xanax use probably went up when I wouldn't smoke. I also have CBD oil but never have tried to use it for this purpose. Mind you, I don't smoke marijuana (THC, that is), it often gives me anxiety and paranoia (thought spirals), it would probably worsen the subjective experience of withdrawal in my case.

There are other issues such as emotional coldness, lack of empathy, extremely bizzare dreams / nightmares, shortness of breath and chest tightness (not panic attacks), constant headache (I know this is temporary). Maybe even more issues but I can't recall it right now due to my memory being shot.

Only one plus side: increased energy (less fatigue), bit even that feels too stimulant-like and not really natural (being wired).

This has been going on for way too long and I'm sick of being brainwashed and not taken seriously.

If I happen to bump into any obstacles, I'll contact you. Thanks man."
benzorecovery,ffi56uv,t1_ffhzx3e,1579965385.0,"Thanks for advice.
I've been on 0.25-0.5mg daily (most often 0.25mg) for 4 months, but I find I get into withdrawal if I take less then cca. 0.4mg daily (that's 1 half of 0.25mg pill every 8 hours).

Anyway, these 4 months got me pretty dependant, I'd rather cut my arm then went cold turkey heh.

Everything makes perfect sense, thanks. I just hope I make it out with my sanity intact because this shit is mind wrecking.

It just came to my mind; is it true that small doses are harder to quit (relatively speaking)? Because this is like 2/3 of the smallest prescribed dose (0.25mg x 3 times daily was prescribed to me, I never took that much because I feared that this would happen), and I'm having one hell of a time quitting it."
benzorecovery,ffi4fn9,t1_ffi0dda,1579964787.0,"Because it was simple. :-D

I'd kinda stir it well before measuring to make sure it's as homogenous as it could get. By my feeling after taking it, it was consistent."

benzorecovery,ffhyd1y,t1_ffc8llo,1579959163.0,"Forgot to ask, how did you determine proper clonazepam dosage, was it by trying different doses and then going with the smallest one that pulls you out of withdrawal, or by using online calculators, Ashton manual or something similar?"

antidepressants,fffle5u,t1_fffho4e,1579886476.0,"Actually I have a question :) Why did you quit Lexapro? Is it because of weight gain plus sexual issues?

Regarding the stimulant effect of Wellbutrin, yeah, for the first 2-3 days I was elated but I disliked it, it felt totally unnatural (synthetic), as if I drank way too much coffe, and I never felt sleepy. Relaxing was difficult because I had this urge to do stuff, like, do anything and everything. It was strange. :-D"

antidepressants,fff3uwm,t1_fff33gn,1579874991.0,"No problem. :-)
Just remember, many will have you think low-carb is ""all or nothing"", but it's not that way. People usually eat say 300g carbs a day, so when you reduce it to say 50g, you might think ""oh that's not Keto so it won't work"" but it will, it's still 6 times less than average and you'll lose weight etc. No need to be an extremist and drop out if you couldn't keep it under 20g carbs. Most important thing is that you can stick to it. All this I found through experience, so some will probably disagree because they see it as all or nothing and I don't.

Best wishes to you too. :)"
antidepressants,fff2w9v,t1_fff1ul6,1579874240.0,"Oh, I just didn't want to bother you too much so I just called it a day (or ""called it a conversation"", whatever you English-speaking people say :-P ).

I'm kinda ""primitive"" so I like to eat lots of eggs, bacon, butter, cheese, salami, tuna, mayonaisse, sometimes protein bread (some go very low in carbs), spinach, chard, meat in general, all fish...

Other foods I personally do not enjoy: avocado, broccoli, cauliflower

That's what I can remember now.

Personally, I primarily concentrated on keeping carbs low (<20g) and not really measuring other macros, however I ate like really fatty meals because I liked it that way so it was probably good. I don't like a lot of lean protein, it fills my stomach but it doesn't make me satiated. I found being very strict about carbs doesn't matter that much, because my girfriend was not as strict as me, she probably was eating like 50g carbs a day but still lost a tonne of weight. I did it for health reasons, not weight.

My low-carb advice: measure carbs and keep them low (how low, you decide, if keto then <20), eat whatever else but it needs to have enough fat to keep you satiated.

Anything else you had on your mind? :)"
science,fff1hb2,t1_fff17qc,1579873097.0,I'm not getting it. Did they blow some air in it's mummified throat and recorded the sound?
antidepressants,fff1dv0,t1_fff0od6,1579873017.0,"Hm... I'm on a low-carb (sometimes Keto) diet and had very stable weight during my 4 month Lexapro treatment. That and the fact that I exercise routinely. I don't claim it's because of my low-carb diet / exercise but who knows.

benzorecovery,fff0qaf,t1_ffewnfj,1579872466.0,"I fully understand you and in the past I did cold turkeyed from cca. 5mg Valium daily and it worked, but I had a very rough 2 weeks. 
Edit: Didn't even know tapering was a thing, but I knew it could be rough.

But this, this is worse, going cold turkey from Xanax happens very fast, in like 24 hours, and it's like being put into fire. Too much, too soon, I admit I can't handle it and I dunno what would happen if I had to do it for some reason. Last time I tried to do it, I thought I should just throw myself out of the window to end my suffering. I had some kind of psychosis I guess, my mind was going nuts. Just being frank with you. Maybe I'm just being sensitive but whatever the reason, I want to be alive at the end of it. :-D"

antidepressants,fff01kb,t1_ffezjxc,1579871862.0,"No I haven't. I guess my psych decided to put me on Wellbutrin (NDRI) because Lexapro (SSRI) had these problematic side-effects, so she basically switched classes to try something different. She even considered putting me on ADHD meds (Concerta) because I was restless, but it was Lexapro that was making me that way... A total misunderstanding, I was like WTF?! :-D

Hm.. I always wondered about the weight gain thing, now it's my chance to ask. :-) Does it mean that it made you eat more (more hunger) so you gathered weight or it was ""out of nowhere"", i.e. eating the same but magically gaining weight?"

I also have anxiety and depression issues and that makes it a whole lot harder, but I know there's no point on being on benzos because all I'm doing is digging my hole deeper.
