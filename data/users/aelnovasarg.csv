siberianhusky,fezevf1,t1_fex7umu,1579456597.0,"Glad to help! Some people have great success keeping their dogs out of specific rooms, I just wasn’t able to. So my house is dog proofed lol but for me, it’s absolutely worth it. Huskies are pure joy, I’m happy to have them wherever I am. 

If you can, check out some training classes. We took our first dog to petsmart for their 6 week course. We learned as much as he did! It taught us how to train the basics, and gave us the tools to know how to train more. There’s also tons of YouTube videos and blogs on training. Huskies love having the mental challenge, training is great for them! 

We taught leave it by using two treats. One that was “high value” (like chicken), and one that was “low value” (like a dog biscuit). We would drop the low value treat, and when he went for it, we would say leave it, and offer the high value treat. He would wait for the high value treat because it was better, and eventually we could do it without treats! It’s still not perfect, but it’s good enough! Best of luck!! :)"
siberianhusky,fev72in,t3_eqmuz3,1579393881.0,"Congrats on your new husky!! 

For crate training, starting right away will probably be best. I can’t give good advice, because I failed to crate train both my huskies. 

You’ll likely find that he will not listen to the bedroom being off limits, and will likely cry by the door. Huskies don’t like being separated from their family. I wouldn’t ever let him in the bedroom if you want to stick with it (my pups are both snoozing on my bed, when we were originally adamantly against them being on the bed). 

For food, the most recommended brand I’ve seen is purina pro plan. It’s what I feed now, after trying five other kinds. 

For pulling, try to train the pup to pull only when in a pulling configuration. So, leash clipped to the back. When you dont want pulling, clip to the side or front of the harness. Teaching “gee”, “haw”, “woah”, etc was a game changer, highly recommend. 

Please do not use a retractable leash, they’re a terrible invention. You’re likely to injure yourself and your pup the first time they take off after a critter, of the mechanism doesn’t break first. Huskies are stronger than they look! Leash belts will be your best friend. 

Also, drop it and leave it are the best commands ever. But be ready for your husky to decide to ignore you completely when they want to. Good luck!!"
dogs,fev19ix,t3_eqohkm,1579391984.0,"My boy ate half a package of rubber bands, maybe like 100? I had no idea he had access to them until I found him chewing down. He was pooping them out for a week!"
PelvicFloor,felno7o,t3_ept2kj,1579226523.0,That’s what did it for me. Sorry you’re going through this :(
AskVet,felnaqx,t1_felkl3v,1579226266.0,"I understand. I don’t know if this makes a difference, but it isn’t so much that I want to complain, but just bring to their attention what has happened. Our vet mentioned when I asked him about the most recent incident, that she might have damaged her meniscus. That’s potentially another surgery, and she will eventually need surgery on the opposite leg (luxating patella). So three leg surgeries over a short period of time. If the meniscus was damaged because of this tech, I think she should know. I don’t want her fired, or even reprimanded. I just want her to ask for help if she needs it, instead of potentially injuring other dogs. 

I realize this is a difficult situation to comment on, and only having part of the story makes it harder. My biggest concern is always the well-being of dogs, mine and others. I just don’t want to ignore something that could make the difference for someone else. Thank you for taking the time to reply! I feel like I’m going crazy trying to care for two injured dogs. :("

AskVet,felkbxl,t3_epjoj1,1579224242.0,"While the sun is up, no hotter than 85°, and only on certain ground (no black top and carefully checking gravel/pavement). Also, only for very very short periods of time (ideally long enough for a bathroom break, not a walk). I live in Tucson, and the ground is lava on summer days. Once the sun is down, the hottest I’ll do is 100°, but that’s only at like a grass dog park with tons of ice water available. And no more than 20-30 minutes, watching closely for any signs of distress. I have two huskies, so I’m extra careful."

lookatmydog,fdkykvg,t1_fdknfx8,1578513822.0,"Turns out he ate part of a toy, while I was watching him to make sure he didn’t eat any. It got stuck in his stomach and intestines, so they had to surgically remove it. Surgery went great; the toy had only been in there about 48 hours (it was a Christmas gift, poor thing), so there was no dead tissue to remove. They kept him about 42 hours, and he’s home now. Thankfully he’s recovering well, though he hates the cone of shame. He won’t leave my side now, he might as well be glued to me lol. He gets the staples out Friday, which I will be very glad for. 

I’m sorry your sweet Elwood has had to have so many surgeries! I hope he’s done with that now. I definitely didn’t get much sleep, even after he was home. I just kept staring at him, so glad he was alive and beside me."

dogs,fdhegxs,t3_el3l17,1578420925.0,"My dog has a chicken and egg allergy, I feel your pain on finding good foods! I’m feeding purina pro plan sensitive skin and stomach, salmon and rice formula. The 30 pound bag was $42 at pet smart & chewy. It’s the cheapest I’ve found so far that I feel comfortable feeding them."
PelvicFloor,fdc75y6,t1_fdbqovf,1578268428.0,"My cramps cause spasms (and the spasms also just happen on their own with no reason), and it’s like a vicious cycle of pain honestly. I have a long heating pad, so I put it in between my legs and bring it up onto my lower abdomen. Hotter the better, personally. Then I just focus of trying my best to relax those muscles, and breathing. It’s easy to forget to breath correctly when you’re hurting. Hot baths also help some. It’s mostly just trying to get your body to actually relax, instead of being in it’s new learned state of tense ness."
PelvicFloor,fd7b3u5,t3_ej22c2,1578201812.0,"The spasms I get around my period are so bad I went to the hospital the first time it happened. I seriously thought something had ruptured or was about to. My periods are every three months due to birth control, so that’s better than every month. But every cycle is extremely painful, nearly unbearable. For some reason, it’s mostly only at night when I’m asleep, it wakes me up. It’s nearly a week of sleepless nights. I also basically live with constant uti like symptoms regardless, which isn’t fun. Pt definitely helped some, and I’m still working on it all nearly a year later. 

I use a heating pad when it’s bad, and do as really hard on relaxing. I also found Motrin and Tylenol together seem to help sometimes. Back rubs focusing on tight muscles can help, too. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, I hope it gets better quickly for you!"
gofundme,fd3g37g,t1_fd2fl77,1578157985.0,"I do have CareCredit, I used it for my other dogs recent and fairly unexpected surgery. Between both dogs over November and December, I spent $8000 to care for them. I’m thankful for CareCredit and credit cards, but paying that off in a reasonable amount of time is definitely hard for us right now. It’s been a tough year with medical expenses, for my dogs and myself. 

Sorry to hear your pup got bit! I’m glad you were able to get her taken care of :)"
dogs,fd1m0ia,t1_fd1hu3f,1578133166.0,"One thing to consider, that I didn’t until recently. It’s nice having a dog you can lift. Both of ours have had some medical emergencies recently that required them being lifted into our truck. I’m not strong enough to lift either dog the way they needed, so I was lucky my husband could. Never really thought about it until it was a necessity."
dogs,fd1h0qi,t3_ejup3j,1578131275.0,"I can’t answer for small dogs, but I can tell you roughly what I spent for two Siberian huskies this year. Ones ~60 pounds, the others ~70 pounds. I spent about $1000 this year on their food, not including treats and special snacks. Their food prices varied, because I tried a few different brands to find a good one. Between $45-$70 for 25-30 pound bags. Hope this helps!"

AskVet,fcuxgon,t1_fcuwjiq,1577990483.0,"He’s on 300mg gabapentin (sp?). He doesn’t appear to be in pain, it’s only if I’m gently poking around the incision (making sure it’s not swollen or too hot). He does get a little restless, but I think it’s more because he’s bored. He seems to want to play with our other dog (also recovering from surgery, it’s a mess). He’s also eating and drinking pretty well, too. 

I’m honestly not sure when this bump appeared, I’m usually not checking super close down there. He also had a lot more fur before the surgery, but they shaved his entire stomach. The coolness probably feels great!"

siberianhusky,fcsvsey,t1_fcstx9n,1577926371.0,"Oh gosh, I’m so sorry. The goal should be one or less every three months. We get the pheno at Walgreens and use a coupon called goodrx. Just google them and enter in the meds you’re looking for, they will give you several coupons at different stores. They say it’s not insurance, but the stores enter them as insurance. Walgreens is one of the more expensive ones at $23/30 day supply (we use them because it’s literally a mile away from us), but I’ve seen some stores have it for $13. Looks like Walmart’s retail on 90 tabs of keppra are $13.44, with similar prices at other stores.

siberianhusky,fcshr70,t3_eini46,1577916757.0,"My 4 year old husky started having seizures this year. His started with a grand mal, and he had two petite mals a month apart ( 3 seizures, each a month apart). He’s on phenobarbital 64.8mg (60 pound husky) twice daily. He’s been seizure free for 5 months thankfully. It might be worth trying different medications, I know some dogs don’t react well on certain meds. Obviously check with your vet. And don’t feel bad about getting a second opinion, either. I asked dozens of people for vet recommendations that have treated seizures before picking one. 

Dogs can have epilepsy without a reason for it. It’s one of the most common diagnoses of epilepsy; idiopathic epilepsy. It’s what my boy has. Once a week is waaay too frequent, she should’ve been put on medication early on. 

I’m so sorry you and your pup are going through this, I know how scary it is. I hope you get it all figured out soon. Feel free to ask any questions, I’ll do my best to answer."

This year I will have spent nearly $12000 on my dogs with various medical emergencies, including my dog who is currently in the hospital after just having a life saving surgery. He’s only 4. The financial aspect aside, the time I’ve had to spend at home caring for them is significant. Nearly two straight weeks for one dog after her surgery, and at least a full week when we get my boy back home. I’m lucky that I can work from home sometimes, though it isn’t easy. Even when they’re healthy, they still require a lot of time and work. I wouldn’t trade them for anything, and I’d do it all over again (though I would get doggy insurance)."
