I think that guy was insinuating that the army isn't as ""tough"" as it was before letting women in, and that women only got in when the standards were lowered. That's bullshit. 

They've actually increased the physical requisites in many places because of better training and nutrition. And people are better marksmen. But the glorification of death and cruelty is still present. It is the army after all."

getdisciplined,fd2iq7e,t3_ejsntn,1578147814.0,"I have ADHD which came make you hyper sensitive to caffeine. 

I never drank a ton of coffee when I lived in the EU but I'd have an espresso or two with some milk and sugar, and I was ok.

When I came back to NAmerica however, and started drinking much taller American coffees, I would get jittery as hell. After a year or two, I quit, and don't really miss it at all. Thankfully the caffeine in tea, which I believe is called theine (sp?), doesn't hit me anywhere near as hard. But chocolate can, so I can't eat chocolate at night. Cocaine, if it's pure, will put me to sleep in, like, ten minutes. Brain chemistry is a bit different. 

Usually all I drink is water, sometimes fruit juices, smoothies, herbal teas, sometimes a hard cider or two if I'm feeling like it. They put all kinds of plastic shit in tea bags, so the next tea I buy will be looseleaf.

Think you wanted more info on how to wean yourself off caffeine? Hope there was something useful for you in my rambles."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fd28ss5,t1_fd0zaca,1578143476.0,This is the correct answer.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd280q7,t1_fd225m6,1578143143.0,"In Canada they did not do this. What they had to stop doing when the women staring joining is stop punching recruits. They used to punch them a lot, apparently. 

I was one of the first group of women in Canada to do full basic infantry training (boot camp, but in the semi-wilderness), and it wasn't that hard. Mind you I was in really good shape at the time, lifted weights, etc. But I was still about five inches shorter than all of the guys. I was by far the best shot. Read somewhere that women are on average better target shooters than men, but there are likely a ton of variables behind that statement. 

If you're in relatively good shape already, boot camp isn't so tough. It's more the mental toughness that's trickier. And avoiding getting raped, of course."
