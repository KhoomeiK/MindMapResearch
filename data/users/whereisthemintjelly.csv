Who benefits?  Come on.  Look at it dispassionately. Put your anger aside.  Add up Sanders support and Warren’s and you may have a front runner. Warren is trending down, Bernie is holding or rising. They are competing for many of the same voters.

Futurology,fe8b5vx,t1_fe6te9n,1578924385.0,"In the US, most minimum wage earners pay no federal income tax.  In the US, that amount you typed is similar but dependent on whether you’re married and how many kids you have.  That doesn’t mean these people don’t pay sales tax or other state and local taxes. Depending on what data you subscribe to, only about half of Americans pay any federal income tax at all and the top 20% pay the vast majority. Low wage earners can and usually receive credits.  The result are refunds that cover any tax that was withheld from paychecks.  Some Americans, especially those that pay tax, call this income redistribution and feel this isn’t fair.  It’s complicated. These refunds help low wage earners a chance to catch up on their bills they’ve accumulated over the year. 

Right now there is a stampede for low wage earners to get their W-2s and file to get their refunds. In the US filing these simple returns is easy and usually electronic.  These taxpayers will get their money in a few days. For those that are married, it’s thousands of dollars."
