It doesn't give me joy, but it gives me this fulfilling moment of peace where it's alright that I don't have anyone for company, having myself is enough. It's really hard to describe but it's just so easy to take most things in that state and I love it."

I live in Perth, and I'm pretty safe from all the fires but it's terrible to just hear what's happening everywhere else and there's little I can do to help. Amazing news though! Hopefully it'll get even better and better. Makes me look forward to winter already!"
