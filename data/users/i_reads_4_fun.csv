Dachshund,fffjhw3,t3_etbhq0,1579885298.0,Squeaky ball. Loves the chase and the squeak of victory when he catches it.
aww,ffcpbld,t1_fezyhd0,1579804336.0,I can only hope.
cats,feyjp7q,t3_eqwnwp,1579446424.0,"When I taught school, I tried class pets. But I had hamsters and guinea pigs. This cat is more commanding."
Dachshund,feyizzu,t3_eqofpf,1579446080.0,"I had never heard of the catahoula. Naturally, I had to “Google” it. Beautiful animal. Your mixed is beautiful, too."

Dachshund,feyh0en,t3_eqqzkt,1579445434.0,I’ve tried to take my dog on various “adventures.” He hasn’t seemed to warm up to any of them. I’ve determined that he’s a hopeless chicken.
aww,feygpsw,t3_eqv7ps,1579445298.0,I may have to assign my Hubby a construction project.
Dachshund,feyfzdf,t3_eqwqsa,1579444994.0,"Love his name. Happy birthday, buddy."
aww,feyfpak,t1_fey6vge,1579444884.0,"I can understand. I had to quit stocking my bird feeders when my son brought home two kittens. Besides wild song birds, I fed hummingbirds at my deck. (We have a home outside of town in a rural area.) The summer before the kittens joined us it wasn’t uncommon to see maybe 20 or more hummers flocking around our deck. THEN, the next summer I caught the cat with a hummingbird beak peeking out of his mouth.  Now the feeders are stored in the basement until the cats are too old and disinterested to bother them. (It’s been 10 years. Actually, I might be the one too old and disinterested before they ever reach that state.)"
aww,fep0ud2,t1_fddc7kw,1579309624.0,"She’s right. You are a lucky, loved man-boy.  .  .  Have you ever seen the children’s book “I’ll Love You Forever” (Robert Munich is the author, I think).   Timeless."

aww,fdxswvx,t3_en4rwb,1578772548.0,"So sorry about the fire situation in your country. Near you or not, it has to have an impact on you. Keep safe."
aww,fdxs9xc,t3_enaxaf,1578772420.0,"I used to fall asleep in class, too."

AnimalsBeingDerps,fdcoz06,t3_ekc5y5,1578280384.0,My mom would say that they are “in Kahoots.”
aww,fdcom67,t3_ekm5q0,1578280123.0,"I’m going to show this post to my son (29yo, unmarried, lives alone). He laughs about how I bring groceries every time I visit (only a few times each year — he doesn’t live nearby). Your son is your son all his life."
Dachshund,fcvk99l,t3_ej0lm9,1578003890.0,Doxie “begging-eyes.”
Dachshund,fcotei3,t3_ei6c50,1577841046.0,I can relate.
dogs,f9su9v9,t1_f9sij1r,1575600705.0,"I know what you mean. I know I spoil my dog. But no grandchildren to spoil - so why not? I haven’t found many toys that he doesn’t completely destroy in a day or two. I’d be pleased to find something that will last, say, a week. Thanks for the input."
