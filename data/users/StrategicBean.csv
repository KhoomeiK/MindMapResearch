TTC,ffcfnpo,t1_ffb2rik,1579798442.0,how is there already a water leakage problem @ this brand new station which only openend 2 years ago?> not a construction expert at all but isn't leaks this quickly a sign of shitty construction?
TheOCS,ff9g0i2,t3_ekjzbh,1579712218.0,I was in Tokyo Smoke at Yonge-Dundas last night to ask about the availability of the  Pax Era Carts. One of the employees told me they should have Pax pods in today
Israel,fez4uvv,t3_eqn2p8,1579453877.0,"What does your ""kosher app"" do though? I see no description in your post about the point of this app and don't really want to click on a random Google Drive link to find out. 

Is it a kosher restaurant list? A kosher symbol (aka hechsher) list with links to/info about the orgs/rabbis who back the symbol? Is it an app that automatically turns your phone to airplane mode on Shabbat?"
Israel,fez3whm,t1_fetr30x,1579453611.0,OP should cover YOUR head? But how is OP supposed to find you??? Lololol
Jewish,fez0988,t1_feyznwn,1579452665.0,The original title - to me - read as a post about a recent event. Sounded awesome to hear that even with all the tension currently this stuff still goes on. To find out the story is not at all current kills that

interestingasfuck,feu3ki3,t1_feu2jp5,1579382767.0,"That also seems like it doesn't quite track. 

First off it is a massive security issue in that if one family member got discovered they'd have a list of the whereabouts of all the other family members for the Nazis to hunt down. 

Second with the fog of war how could anyone expect to keep such info up to date?"

Judaism,fdx7kxx,t3_en937e,1578766074.0,Congrats!
TTC,fdto1gm,t1_fdth3ts,1578719565.0,TTC needs revenue. Why are ads so bad as another source for it?
whatisthisthing,fdt0djc,t3_emxclt,1578710291.0,Might be [Paleo-Hebrew] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet) which is related to Phoenician like others have mentioned. Paleo-Hebrew is also as its name implies the precursor toModern Hebrew (as you yourself noticed) so there is noticeable similarities in some of the letters
whatisthisthing,fdsxl7c,t1_fds467t,1578709258.0,"Nope, it couldn't be Yiddish. Yiddish uses the Hebrew alphabet"
Judaism,fdswlml,t3_en04kk,1578708889.0,"It sort of looks like Paleo-Hebrew which is a pre-cursor to Hebrew. I can't read Paleo-Hebrew but like others who commented can read Hebrew and though some of the letters look like Hebrew the majority isn't

Link to wikipedia article about Paleo-Hebrew - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Hebrew_alphabet"
worldnews,fdsuq63,t1_fdsdlq0,1578708189.0,Canada does. That's the whole story. It's in the OP's article

toronto,fdnukfo,t1_fdnua77,1578593136.0,Nice!
toronto,fdnuaha,t1_fdnt8qv,1578592970.0,"Oops! I confused Heath (which I read was the street when you commented in a different reply) with Harbord

Even still, if you look at the map in the link it shows that Heath is indeed cleared between Spadina & Russell Hill as well as between Dunvegan & Avenue Rd. Not sure why there'd be 2 blocks where they don't clear the sidewalk but I could see a situation where the person doing the clearing doesn't stop for those 2 blocks when doing the rest of Heath...or even the salt spilling out of the truck when it goes over a bump or an angled bit of sidewalk or something"
toronto,fdnsza6,t1_fdns0sn,1578592217.0,"So just lazy people all over the city are all doing this to their sidewalks? I'm pretty sure I've seen a miniature tractor looking vehicle in North York that salts sidewalks. It sure looks like it's part of a city service

After writing the above I googled & here's a link to the city of Toronto page about ""Clearing Snow & Ice from the Sidewalk"" [https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/road-maintenance/winter-maintenance/clearing-snow-and-ice-from-your-property/](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/streets-parking-transportation/road-maintenance/winter-maintenance/clearing-snow-and-ice-from-your-property/) on that page H̶a̶r̶b̶o̶r̶d̶ Heath is in ""Toronto East-York District"" map so it looks like the city does indeed clear & salt that sidewalk

Edit: Originally wrote Harbord instead of Heath so I fixed but left the original there with strikethrough so replies still make sense"
toronto,fdnrw1y,t3_embt21,1578591589.0,Seen this on sidewalks all over the city. I'm guessing the city's sidewalk salting machines/vehicles need some maintenance or need to be replaced

GooglePixel,fdl7jyb,t1_fdl7gm3,1578518387.0,Well I can only say I hope I'm an update away from having it too
GooglePixel,fdl79f7,t1_fdkv5q1,1578518239.0,Not seeing it on the Pixel 2 XL and I keep my stuff as up to date as possible
GooglePixel,fdl768y,t1_fdjnm0o,1578518196.0,Not seeing it on the Pixel 2 XL either. I'm thinking it might be a newer Pixel thing
AmItheAsshole,fdc6flc,t1_fdc3am4,1578268020.0,True but the amount destroyed is so small in a relative sense so they'd probably only add that if they're pursuing the other things too

IllegalLifeProTips,fd74vo0,t1_fd74gul,1578199465.0,Yeah but might happen when they review their security tapes after large & expensive items - especially controlled things like alcohol - start going missing & they need to account for how they got out of the store
IllegalLifeProTips,fd74797,t1_fd72o5d,1578199211.0,I would imagine pushing that button triggers something that results in extra scrutiny of your purchase/transaction
IllegalLifeProTips,fd6x3b1,t1_fd6wwte,1578196807.0,Guess it depends on the place. I dunno I've never examined these things that much tbh but it's something to be aware of before running this scam
IllegalLifeProTips,fd6wotb,t1_fd6wbsl,1578196673.0,Places I've seen have a bagging area. The bagging area does have a scale in it & you're required to put the item in the area after scanning it. They do this specifically to avoid people running scams like this one
IllegalLifeProTips,fd6roqz,t1_fd6iuxl,1578194890.0,I'm in Canada
IllegalLifeProTips,fd6rji3,t1_fd6qr3s,1578194839.0,The ones I've seen/used (in Canada) require you to put it in the bagging area & won't continue until you do so. Probably so they can weigh the item & prevent this exact thing

IllegalLifeProTips,fd6fv6k,t1_fd6f0n2,1578190360.0,Most self checkout I've seen have scales in them so they'd know your cooler was overweight AF if it had a case of beer in it

Nothing special aside from the fact that after close to 2 millennia of waiting we live in a world which includes a strong, sovereign Jewish State in our ancient homeland and that after 70 plus years of Israel's existence we take it for granted and are so used to it that one can think there's nothing special about a photo of the Star of David flag of the independent Jewish State flying over the Kotel. So yeah, nothing special :)"
