Could you explain what this is?"
dogs,fczxvb8,t1_fczw6uv,1578110500.0,I actually recently signed up to be a foster and am waiting to hear back. Not sure if it will work out though because I work full time and do not live in a house with a yard. Maybe for the right dog though it would work.
dogs,fczx2px,t3_ejmnrf,1578110101.0,"I can't recommend any particularly indestructible toys but have a funny anecdote. 
I had a lab and a terrier who weren't 10 minute destroyers but would eventually tear toys and proceed to rip them to shreds until all the stuffing is scattered around the house. Someone gave us some stuffed animals (kids toys) for some reason and we gave them to the dogs and they lasted longer than any dog toy. I don't think it was that they were manufactured stronger; I think the dogs were just gentler with Minnie mouse. Even when she lost her purse and the alluring stuffing started to show through - she endured at least a few more months including tug of war challenges. Perhaps they were more respectful...or maybe they knew there was no squeaker inside so what's the point haha. I'll never know."

Sometimes if I'm anxious I don't eat properly and if I don't eat enough I get nauseous so that's also something to consider if it contributes for you."
