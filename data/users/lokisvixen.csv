service_dogs,ff94dls,t3_es8teh,1579704558.0,I had a good interaction the other day with my SDIT . I was in Wal-Mart which is always stressful for me and a lady with kids came up the isle . The kids instantly started shouting doggy doggy but the mom picked the youngest up and told them both no doggy is working we can't pet it . I was impressed I thanked her immediately and we went about our day.
service_dogs,ff81ess,t1_ff7qjzx,1579663464.0,Will do thanks
service_dogs,ff7qake,t1_ff7p8rl,1579655750.0,Thanks. I'm so happy
service_dogs,ff7k4id,t1_ff7eqlu,1579651441.0,No problem everyone needs a few kind understanding words now and then best of luck to you
service_dogs,ff7jxkc,t3_es39a4,1579651308.0,"There is no licence for a service dog . the only ways to get one is to get a dog all ready trained by an organization, put a dog through a program , or owner train which all cost lots of money and owner training could end with a dog washing out aka being unable to work.  All cost thousands to fully train a dog and insurance doesn't cover a Service dog."
service_dogs,ff7epiw,t3_eryarx,1579647829.0,I'm 24 so not in school but I got my SDIT Bella from a shelter when she was a year and a half she is almost 2 now and we have just started public access training. When we picked her out we had a former dog rehabilitater aka my fiance temperament test her . he has many years of working with problem SPCA dogs.. We are owner training and she is picking up skills fast but its a slow time consuming process.
service_dogs,ff7dvki,t3_ery800,1579647285.0,Explain the time money and training that is needed by law to have your SD in public and tell her you have to be diagnosed with a disability to even go through with getting the dog. If she still wont budge take your own needs into account and distance yourself. I know how hard it can be to have a medical episode alone in public it can be scary and embarrassing. having my lovely SDIT with me helps a ton and I'm sure your future SD will do wonders for you too.
service_dogs,ff7c7mi,t3_ermrfz,1579646148.0,Well said

service_dogs,fetdi94,t3_eqk577,1579374233.0,My SDIT is an Australian cattledog mix from a shelter and she has made leaps and bounds in training that alone should show you mixed breeds and rescues are still good choices

service_dogs,fdzf1lx,t3_en3z0z,1578789626.0,A rescue is a much cheaper option than a breeder and all you need for an ESA is a decently well behaved pup and a note from a physician

DogBreeding,fdoscfw,t3_em4wuf,1578611792.0,I wouldn't recommend breeding them hip problems are genetic. Breeding bad genetics is cruel to the puppies and potential owners .

service_dogs,fc8znpu,t3_eg5ojz,1577544665.0,I recommend you put through the effort and research owner training as well as find a good trainer to help where you get stuck . don't discount shelter dogs just if you go that rout do so with caution and someone who knows dogs such as a trainer or behaviorlist.
BipolarReddit,fbm45g3,t3_edtwqi,1576977885.0,"As someone with bipolar this is what I would like from a partner. Listen when she needs you, Check in when things seem off calmly, Know that during a manic eppisode that it's not me or who I want to be, Know I'm trying my best . during a depression eppisode know that I still love you just not feeling up to anything but I'm glad your thinking of me by trying to include me in things."
