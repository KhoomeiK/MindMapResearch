aww,ffea97p,t1_ffe8giv,1579841062.0,I live in a place where the mosquitos are so bad they completely drained a local lake to at least limit them back in the '20s and heck I'm just in BC.

Whatisthis,ffafxbm,t1_ff97r4k,1579734819.0,"When I worked in a heritage house we had one of these for demonstrations in the kitchen. How old is your home, OP?"
personalfinance,ff83xoi,t3_erxp9e,1579665338.0,"Hey OP, I just want to say - I've been where you are. Dropped out of high school due to my mental health, graduated high school with shitty grades. When I was ready I started doing courses at community college and started building my grades back up. Once I had a year of good performance I applied to transfer to a school which has things more in line with my interests, started living on my own, etc. Managed to get some great summer jobs with great bosses who helped me find my niche. It took me longer to graduate but I managed to get my BA in 2017 and I'm currently upgrading in order to apply for grad school, I did an internship for 6 months and just got back from spending the last year abroad.

My point is, you are not fucked. You are still young and you still have time. Things can change more than you expect and in less time than you'd think. Ten years ago I was a high school drop out struggling to complete my GED - if someone had told me how things had turn out I wouldn't have believed it. You can absolutely turn your life around.

The most important thing is your support network. If you decide to go back to school absolutely check out disability services and be aware of the services available to you. If you have a formal diagnosis you probably qualify. Your parents sound like they're supportive of you, which is great. If you don't have a therapist and are able to find the resources to see one I would 100% recommend finding one. If it's a struggle there might be some resources available to you - I'm not American so my knowledge is limited but [this](https://captainawkward.com/2011/09/22/how-to-locate-low-cost-mental-health-care-in-the-us-and-canada-guest-post/) might help.

Having no real work experience is a hurdle, but there are ways of overcoming that. Volunteering in something you're interested in is one way to get some entries on your resume, and helps you build your soft skills and make connections with potential employers or good references. 

I wish you all the best, OP."

BuyItForLife,ff7m3ct,t3_ervyig,1579652809.0,"Just in case you aren't aware, cords from that era usually contained asbestos - I'd personally replace the entire cord (with appropriate protection) if you haven't already. I work in museums, it comes up as a collections hazard often."
relationships,ff7ktfo,t1_ff75kys,1579651923.0,"Sometimes we aren't at the right time and place in our lives to take a hard look at the difficult and painful stuff we carry. The problem comes when you get stuck there and it compounds the problem. I get defensive and stubborn as hell in therapy nearly every time I go, then go home and process it for a week and end up at the same conclusion just in time for the next session."
psychology,ff7iqnw,t1_ff76k5o,1579650499.0,I wonder if this has to do with neuroplasticity - neural pathways forge connections through use and they might not care that you had to use a drug to forge those new neural pathways. If they create these neural connections perhaps it's possible that you can still activate those neural pathways without being in an altered state.
psychology,ff7i0xj,t1_ff6vxdk,1579650019.0,"Some people have a disconnect from their bodily sensations and experiences due to anxiety/depression/ptsd etc. For example, due to past trauma I tend to disassociate when experiencing uncomfortable emotions or sensations because ignoring is a great coping mechanism - until you don't even know what you're feeling anymore and it's starting to cause harm. You know when people tell you to trust your gut? Imagine you ignored your gut to the point where you don't even know what it's telling you anymore. Emotions are also bodily experiences - a large part of telling how your feeling is those sensations like your heart pounding, that lump in your throat, that swoop in your stomach. 

Then add the fact that the part of the brain that plans stuff is part of that broken system that keeps you in line, tells you what's what. You don't take emotional risks because your planning brain is reminding you that when you tried that last time you got hurt. The brain sees emotional pain and physical pain pretty similarly and basically goes: stimulus bad, must avoid stimulus, must make choices to prevent stimulus from happening again. Basically you brain is Madagascar and it Shuts. Down. Everything. when you feel unpleasant emotions. Makes it pretty hard to take risks that most people have to take to have a happy life, like asking someone out on a date or socializing with other people. Then you end up in a feedback loop.

Is is 100% my experience talking, but I suspect the utility is that psychedelics interrupt this cycle by circumventing the ""higher reasoning"" brain and upping the sensations and experiences of the moment. You live in the now and don't get bogged down as much dwelling in the past or worrying about the future. You go zen. You experience childlike joy and wonder instead of the protective negativity without your asshole brain telling you how you suck or that you should never let yourself be vulnerable. You get some distance from the inside of your own head and get to view yourself from another perspective without lizard brain popping in to put an end to it in order to protect itself.

In short, I think it helps you rewire your brain to turn off the reactive and critical mind a bit and helps you learn to listen to your body and emotions again, which is helpful for people with particular types of mental health struggles."
AskReddit,ff79p9w,t3_erx73j,1579644015.0,Nice try. I'm invoking my fifth amendment rights.
vancouver,ff79c4j,t1_ff6xbgt,1579643754.0,Hankies can leak onto your hands which provides plentiful opportunities for secondary transfer. Plus if you use the same hanky more that once without washing it you're just brewing bacteria in your pocket to come in contact with your hands next time. Coughing and sneezing into your elbow (fully covering your nose and mouth) keeps your hands clean and is the current recommendation that any health care professional will give you. If you have a really snotty sneeze I can see why a hanky might be preferable but you really should be washing your hands after you do.
