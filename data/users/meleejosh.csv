AnimalsBeingBros,ffefojh,t3_eszfoc,1579846219.0,"I thought that there was no dog alive that could survive in a fight against a wolf? Obviously I was wrong. Are Tibetan mastiffs at the top of the hierarchy for fighting dogs?
Another question.. I don’t think these are North American Timberwolves ..  could a Tibetan mastiff take on a Namerican Timberwolf?"

Something I recommend you try is healthy eating and exercise. There’s scientific and anecdotal evidence which shows these two can really change the way you think, feel and act all for the better!"

confession,fcg1274,t3_egtp3e,1577635503.0,"I don’t really know what to say, this is a very hard situation. A few things came to mind when reading this, you were 12 when this happened, a lot of kids do stupid things, I did lots of dumb things. There are millions and millions of kids who have pushed a person but without injury. Unfortunately the person you pushed broke his spine. You didn’t intend for this to happen.

I know someone who broke their spine and they are happier now than before the accident because they became religious and now have a strong faith. So someone can still be happy after that kind of accident.

My sincere advice to you would be... start praying to god, ask god for help and guidance. And pray for the boy you pushed and his family"

It hurt pretty bad plus I think the shock made it feel worse. Anyway, left a dent in my nail at the bottom, now as the nail is growing (3months on) I have this kinda sharp bump in my nail. Not sure if it will eventually go back to normal."
