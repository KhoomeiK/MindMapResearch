So those interests just evaporate and made her seems pull and release the interest rope to you.

I know you still want her but it seems without mutual interest and effort it would be hard and only lead to broken heart."

ptsd,feq4r2g,t3_eqcdrd,1579337677.0,You can chat me if you want and tell your problem. I know it wont solve your problem but I hope I can be a person for you to listen 😀
depression_help,femrbon,t1_femn64k,1579267366.0,"Thank you for your suggestion. Yeah, I labelled as a rant because I hate when the nurse and other people told me it was my own problem and not theirs. I know I never mentioned it was their problem either, but I was just asking information to those people that could help me but they just sent me away. And I am tired of getting sent off every time I reach out people. And they just told me I am an adult so I should manage to find a solution by myself."
ADHD,femc2gu,t3_eps5ed,1579247992.0,Congratulations!!!
ptsd,feleb1v,t3_eps34n,1579220157.0,"Rather than talk sometimes I prefer to write like a diary or journal. And post it randomly to forum or Reddit. 
I also talk to myself but not often. It just small commands or small motivation."
depression,fekbmao,t3_ep842q,1579196652.0,"I remember someone told me this 7 years ago through online gaming. He wanted to end his life. I told him not to be sad because of his parent's behaviour. He helped me a lot to finish my education and put his education later. And now I am glad he could be a good radiologist. Now the one that depressed is me lol. People change. I always put in my mind about an old Latin phrase ""sic transit gloria mundi"", a reminder that the earth only a transit place. So everything is always changing and never last forever. I know sounds very cliche but that how I tried to bring positivity in my life. Your girlfriend could not be yours forever, and one day you could find another person. I know it takes time and hurts. But put your energy into something that more make you valuable. Probably by doing volunteer or help people."
indonesia,fek4jby,t3_chj8r8,1579192453.0,"Yup sama nih gw kangen kaskus deh. Gw dulu banyak dapet info kerjaan dari kaskus, terus kalau bingung atau galau suka posting di kaskus buat dapet advice atau saran. Sekarang susah gw bingung mau kemana. Sempet gw pake Quora tapi jarang dibales gitu, ga ngerti harus populer dulu baru ada yang nanggepin apa gimana. Pertanyaan di Quora juga pendek - pendek banget dan pas awal - awal belom ada yang bahasa Indonesia.   


Gw udah lama ninggalin kaskus sih. Emang udah ga oke apalagi sejak jatuh FJBnya. Gw juga penasaran kalau ada forum yang sama kayak kaskus gitu. Reddit di banned di Indonesia jadi susah aksesnya dan emang bener ga spesifik jadi agak terlalu sporadis aja postingannya.   


Kaskus juga isinya anak - anak yang suka ngetroll ga jelas doang, padahal gw nemu banyak temen - temen baik satu komunitas di sana."
ptsd,fek2tqz,t3_epbiz0,1579191416.0,"I always tried to washed my hair and take shower. Eat a lot of food. Play your favourite music. Go to a place that you like.

The best thing you can do is to distract your mind. It is hard but it will help a lot. When you get distracted then you will move on from your bad day.

And probably you can talk with me if you want 😀"
depression,fek2951,t1_fek1cno,1579191065.0,"It reminds me my old motivation to stay alive. I want to watch the ending of One Piece before I die. But now I don't really have any purpose of life. I am trying to find one but it is quite difficult. Many things that I expected didn't work like what I thought. 
Now I am wasting my time to make myself happy. I know probably I am burden to other people that give me scholarship. But yeah I do that to make myself happy."
dating_advice,fek11sf,t3_ephuo3,1579190319.0,"In my country (Asian country), it is considered to be okay as long as you do that in the right place. For example in the university library, in the cafe, in the gym, or in the place that brings positive vibes. But I guess again it depends on the culture. But to say you are really beautiful is inappropriate. Probably talking about job or interest and change number is fine as long you can make the conversation is interesting. But I usually ask for social media rather than a phone number, for me number is more private while social media is just a place that you want to get more followers etc so it is fine.   


But I heard in another country (Europe) approaching random people just for talk is considered as a creep."
depression,fejxnmn,t1_fehnizk,1579188202.0,"This is what I feel every day. I sometimes told myself I should have ended my life a long time ago so I don't suffer more pain in the future. Every time I got bad things happen in my life, those negative thoughts come again in my mind."
MyLittleSupportGroup,fejwntp,t3_dx0fbw,1579187559.0,You can speak to me if you still need it

ptsd,fejq8mx,t3_epf4dv,1579183075.0,"If you need someone to listen you can tell me. 

I have PTSD but I haven't got any treatment yet and my previous therapist was advising me to get EMDR. 

I try to keep myself busy to avoid negative thoughts, even the consequences I could not focus on what I should do. But I think it is important to keep our self stay healthy not only physically but also mentally. So break for a while it is okay. 

Probably you can try what I did, even though most of them don't really work on me. I joined lots of competition. I tried online dating. I tried diverse apps about depression (7cups) and making friends (slowly).  I tried to post things in Quora, Reddit, or even depression group on Facebook. I joined a lot of support group by browsing support group on google and FB. I also do sports, fitness, swimming, squash, cycling, and squash.  
I met some horrible people I might say during my effort to make me still sane. But I think that is the only thing I could do rather than end myself."
asexuality,fejl4wi,t3_epfcq1,1579178579.0,"What do you post here. I feel that for a long time. I always confused about my self. I hate being a girl since I was kid because girl is always being a sexual object. For instance for job etc. But this probably culture related to the place I grown up.
Apart from that, I never really attracted sexually to someone. I feel disgust to see a naked male. I prefer to see a naked female lol. But I dont feel aroused if I see both of them.
I dated boys several times of course I got aroused when they touched me but I thought it was more like biological. If there were no touch then I felt nothing and plain. 
I also always want to change my gender to male. Because I hate become a women. I feel weak and not strong enough in physical terms and probably culture related one more time.
Overall, I am still confused. I also prefer non romantic relationship such as platonic. I prefer that because that is more like gender neutral. 
Sometimes I consider myself a bi or lesbi. But I am not attracted sexually to women so I am confused."
asexuality,fejkrwc,t3_epdzw2,1579178214.0,"I always think myself is asexual since I was kid probably 8 or 9 years old. I always hate to be a woman because often become a sexual object of people around me. I don't know why because I never feel crazy or in love with other human being. I mean I love them but not in sexual way or attracted to much.

When I grew up I did dating but for me it was not really interesting. I never attracted to do sexual things. The boys that I have been dating felt that they didn't see me interested or love them probably also in sexual way. So that we never reach relationship. I only had relationship once but he never had sex with me and I was very happy about it.

Then one of person I dated with recently told me, probably I search for platonic relationship. Then I browsed it and found this post. And I think I am kinda asexual but just trapped in formality of being sexual society."
ptsd,fej9wxv,t3_ep7158,1579163356.0,Get out from the relationship. Threats or violence never good for relationship. People hard to change. His behaviour will remain like that. You the one that can change to move back from him.
depression,fegdate,t1_fegd6y8,1579088590.0,Lol yeah.... it has been a long time since I got trolls hahahah
offmychest,feetgzg,t3_cxe8zz,1579040856.0,"Probably I am kinda late giving reply. But I experienced a similar thing to you.
Well I am trying to find alternative to get out things from my chest by finding online community. This is also what my psychologist told me. I got an advice to join reddit from someone on tinder. I knew reddit from a long time but it is blocked in my country. So I never used it before to post something. Now, I moved to another country and I have started to write things here.
What I wrote here mostly about my problems not my daily life activity. I also never put my real profile since it would be dangerous. And I posted here about my dating experience with ADHD boy from subreddits to subreddits because no one replied me and I was wondering where should I put it. And suddenly a girl I supposed trolling me by saying I was attention seeker. Post mainly about dating and live for an expat. Well she definitely look into my profile. She probably read my depression post but still she is trolling me. I wrote different details from post to post and she said I was lying. Actually, I just want to make everything shorter rather than long story and complocated. So people could still get the main idea of what I asked and give me an advice."
ADHD,feeru9m,t1_feere0l,1579039861.0,"I never meet someone with ADHD previously so I didnt know about the difference.

Well, I tried to make my post shorter so people could read it rather than longer post. It seems my longer post were not getting many comments, while I need some inputs. 

For some reasons I think you trolling too much. First for being nosy about my personal life and now judge that I am lying.

It was very unfortunate to meet a person that very rude like you in a subreddit like this."
ADHD,feen3eo,t1_feem34c,1579037099.0,"Is that a problem if I am new here and post about my life? Is that also a problem if I am seeking someone to date?
I just need to share things and talk with people. If you dont like it just dont give a comment as simple as that.

I just want to know and I dont know where to ask. Lots of online groups I used to ask were unactive such as Mirc or yahoo messenger.

And apart from that, I am just curious how to handle with ADHD person. And I was not sure how to handle with it."
ADHD,feejuey,t1_feejpvo,1579035211.0,Oh I thought because I read on article that lies sometimes part of ADHD so it could be a reason why he is lying.
ADHD,feehycy,t3_eolypx,1579034117.0,I also made a mistake last year so I billed thousand euro it was sucks.
dating_advice,feegfsi,t1_febnmud,1579033241.0,"For me attractiveness is kinda vague. I mean sometimes I chose someone from appearance but sometimes I prefer their behaviour over anything. And I was wondering have you ever meet someone that you are attracted from looks but after you met you said like ""meh"" not my type."

I sometimes forgot to turn on the music and then still silence.
Yeah I had hobbies. Now I am lost interest and unable to buy console and TV. I am a gamer. My laptop also broken. 
I am trying to do sport as my hobby but I am not that expert. Unfortunately people around me are expert in sports so I feel left behind. Sigh"

dating_advice,fecty44,t1_fec7fdw,1578984497.0,"Yeah I mean the arranged dating by acquintance is based on his/her preference on looks or appeareance. For instance, long black hair, blue eyes, tall, etc."
dating_advice,febbumt,t1_fe95p4e,1578957268.0,Did you put like high standard for attractiveness? I was wondering how is it work if no one attractive ever attracted to you.

ForeverAloneDating,fe99t3a,t3_eo492p,1578935651.0,How about talking random stuff ? I am a very random person. I like cartoon and games but rarely play video games anymore. I am currently a student and very lonely. hahahah...
ForeverAlone,fe94qqe,t3_eo5zr6,1578934248.0,I also often got a reply about that in real life. But I am not a bar person and very introvert
ptsd,fdq7c2h,t3_emkhfl,1578657952.0,"I have it several times, especially when I am very stressed out and depressed. I crossed the street with bike and almost get hitted by bus, luckily the bus is stopped.
Another case that often happen, I made an appointment by writing a letter and even talk to some people personaly. And I wrote it directly during the discussion about the meeting, but apparently I told them different date and day rather than I wrote down. And, my memory always believe what I wrote and I remember I said the date exactly same as I told but it was completely different.

But I could not even remember if I did he wrong things. I dont even have memory about it. And I build a memory on top of it or even blackout."
intj,fdimi7e,t3_efulxi,1578446214.0,"No but i think if you really want to have sex it is better to go for a dating app like Tinder for hookup.
There are lots of men want to have sex freely."
SuicideWatch,fdig1qi,t3_eeyc3w,1578442085.0,"Hey, to be honest I have PTSD and went into hospital recently. Now I kinda suicidal but I want to say that believe me there is lots of happiness out there somehow. Probably you could start to travel. I did travelling several times to erase my depression.
And worse I dated several people on dating app just to  distract my mind 🙈. 
Also, if you want you can chat to me."
Advice,fdi32fd,t3_ea9fqm,1578434850.0,"It seems silly but I also through depression you can send me a PM if you want.
Apart from that, in my opinion and experience Tinder mostly for hookup. I always put no FWB no ONS no hookup to get better match. At least even though they swipe me without looking my profile. The chance getting longer term dating is improved.
The positive thing about dating app is easier to meet people. I am an expat but I could meet new people very easy in my country without dating app but since I moved to Europe it is easier to meet someone using the app. I am not sure if this is valid in your case too.

That is true rejection makes depression getting worse but if you don't afraid rejection that go for it. I mostly ghostes after second date. So I didn't expect anything."
dating_advice,fdhzywe,t3_elh4la,1578433253.0,"Talk to her. When I was a barista, customers often added my social media profile and chatted me there. Sometimes they asked me for hangout and I said yes after long conversation during making beverages.
Or you could just try to be friendly to her rather than direct approach."
ptsd,fdhyuml,t3_el1xa1,1578432655.0,"Im taking medicine right now and in the beginning the medicine I took, quetiapine made me disoriented and impair judgement. The lame thing I got raped again because of this.
But after awhile, it seems the medication worked like 2 months. I have better mood and stuff. But now I want to stop and people told me to stop from medication. I tried to stop by myself and my mood crashed. I am thinking of suicidal a lot but I can still control it. Now I am in reddit to make myself away from those negative thoughts."
Netherlands,fdhxoek,t3_dvet9t,1578432039.0,"What is the meaning of Kato actually?

I am an Asian with mixed blood face and has dark brown hair. But I often dyed my hair into brunette. Recently I colored my hair into black. And I found when my hair was brunnete people speak Dutch to me. I could speak little bit Dutch actually. But now most of people always speak English and I recently got unexpected experience from a nurse that won't help me because the Netherlands is not paying their social workers to help people like me. Well I am not sure if it was racism or she just being rude. I just insisted that was her job but nothing she could do and she sent me out."
Netherlands,fdhvxak,t3_ek4hib,1578431110.0,"I am a student and soon become an expat here I hope. Most of my friend I made people are my co workers. But they are also immigrants from Middle eastern or Asia.
I have a Dutch friend from student association but he was more into FWB with me and not really a close friend. I also have two Dutch housemates but we are not close anymore since they have girlfriend and boyfriend. I considered they were my good friends but not sure now.
About dating, since I had no luck with dating students except for the lame FWB guy, I tried to use dating apps. But, it was hard to maintain the meeting after first date. Most of them demanded sex during the first date and it was annoyed me. I have one person that still in contact. It looked like I friendzoned him but that because I wanted to have long term relationship and he said if I went back to my country he would break me up. And, I told him then we should end this date but he is willing to see me every week for hangout.
I also use slowly app for a friend but Dutch friend female or male both seems not really interested to build more solid friendship. Some Dutch around me and articles talked about Dutch has inner circle their build since childhood or young age. And they consider people they meet during adulthood more like colleagues rather than friends. 
Some people advice me to join clubs or sports but I am not good at it. And, sports clubs mostly for competition and professional. And they invest a lot in sports and I am not a sport person. I do sports only for fun and not really expert so I found it is difficult to integrate. But as I read, friends from sports are not long term and close friend.
I also don't go to party because here is mostly young students and I am like 29 years old. I tried several times and I didnt know how to approach them with loud music and 18 years old boy seems not my type."
Netherlands,fdhtphg,t3_eageah,1578429976.0,"How about applying PHD in the Netherlands? It seems many people trying to move to the Netherlands by studying. Probably you could also apply for a Chinese government scholarship?

I found most of the guy there regardless their age rushed into sex and after that no communication or slowly disappeared. I was not promiscuous woman. So, I found this is annoyed me. 

And I kinda gave up with this condition. I like sex but change partner every date seems lame. I tried to maintain contact with them but it was difficult. One of guy that I date, I hold him for not having sex with me, but it seems he gave signals that he wanted to have sex. I don't mind if we have longer relationship but he said if I went back to my country in which my visa would expire in 6 months. Then, he would break me up.
I also wondering because I met them online so they are ghosting me so quickly or it just because dating now more about sex rather than romantic and love feeling. I decided to not date him anymore and now I am stopped dating as previously. I have been single for 7 years."
