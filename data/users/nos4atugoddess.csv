childfree,ffld5dt,t3_eu2fxp,1580038013.0,"Or a positive way to look at this is that she isn’t actually pregnant she is just pushing her belly out in the second picture (my best friend can push her belly out to look prego but it looks like this, not real prego which is much much lower). She is wearing the same thing, hair the same, makeup the same, same field. She color corrected the grass, and made the meme to make a statement about how she doesn’t want to be pregnant, and is happy she isn’t! Or someone else made it of their friend to make the same statement."

But upon his brand new rebuild on the mainland, he is all set to go on, renewed in the real world to cause some trouble this season.

SubredditDrama,feiak4z,t1_fehn8bq,1579133996.0,"Also, and stop me if I’m completely wrong, but if there really was a world with sentient species other than human, I think human race would become a lot less important in that world. When you start worrying about what SPECIES something is, I’d think the little nuances within each species would no longer be such a problem, or rather the segregation wouldn’t be so pronounced based on the things that don’t really matter like skin color. Everything with people is “us” against “them”, so it stands to reason there would be a lot wider circle around the human “us”. Like the argument doesn’t even hold water if you really considered what living in a world like that would be like. The lines would not be in the same place as now, and viewing/judging it with the bias from our world doesn’t make the slightest bit of sense to me."

Showerthoughts,fe7t5j7,t1_fe6kz00,1578918989.0,"There was another huge renovation not many years ago (2010ish I think), mostly to the residences side if I recall correctly, but that was when I got the “backstage tour”. I honestly can not remember who was doing everything, but I do remember that the woman who was pretty much in charge of it all had no children before she started it and after the 5 years she had been working on the project, had had two babies! I thought she was incredible for overseeing everything there while pregnant, twice! Not totally relevant, but I really admired how difficult that must have been, and it just made me even more impressed with her. I’m just horrible with names! 

Oh another cool fact I remember now too- the hallways has great big slabs of marble, and they wanted to add more for some reason, but because it’s historical they had to make sure it was a perfect match to the existing. Somehow they had the information about not only where the original marble was from but the exact spot it had been cut from, and they were able to go back to the exact same mountain to the exact same spot and cut a brand new piece of literally the exact same marble. That also blew my mind!"

Showerthoughts,fe67uoz,t1_fe60hmp,1578883720.0,"Yes! And it is also why the windows in some of the higher floors in fancy buildings aren’t as nice as the lower ones. I remember taking a tour of the renovations at the Plaza hotel in NYC and the architect was saying that people in the higher floors wanted bigger, nicer windows but because the hotel had been built before elevators, the upper floors where were the servants and staff lived, so they got the smaller windows.  I always thought that was a cool fact and now when I look at old buildings I try to look out for that feature."

I figured some new response got added to her list for that phrase “TV Time” and thought maybe the “No, televisions are not clock times” response was a reference to something that people other than me might understand because it’s such a nonsense phrase. Sort of like when you say “Earl Grey, hot” and she says “the replicators are not yet functional”. 

I thought people might also think it’s funny or know the source of that response but maybe it’s just the combination of “TV” and “time” that’s confusing her and it doesn’t mean anything. Slightly disappointing though. I had hoped it was a new Easter egg that I stumbled on!"

I used to love to look up crime scene photos of things I was hearing about or reading about, and now it’s just upsetting to see any of that. I made the mistake of looking up the photos of that poor girl that got decapitated in a car accident that people thought was funny to keep sending her family pictures of the accident a few years ago. Decided to see what the fuss was about. It’s burned into my mind forever and the thought of her parents constantly seeing it makes me so sick. Maybe empathy grows as we get older, or suddenly we realize how fragile we all are or something, I don’t know. But I can’t look at that stuff anymore either.

westworld,fdfchbj,t3_el2o7j,1578358441.0,"I think that’s kind of part of the complexity of the character actually. I think Wyatt IS a masculine program, or rather was intended to be male when written by Ford (don’t forget in Teddys programming Wyatt was originally a soldier with him). I thought it was kind of interesting that Ford chose to give the programming to Dolores because after all she is just a machine, and though built to look like a woman why not have a masculine personality? She isn’t actually female either, just has female looking parts. We don’t know what kind of bodily processes they actually have so if hormones don’t come into the mix, and they can’t reproduce, then all the biological factors aren’t even really there other than some skin flaps. Their gender is all programmed 100%. You see a woman called Wyatt or Dolores but the package doesn’t really matter much... and in the same regard it’s super fascinating to see a woman acting just like a man, because for all intents and purposes she is just as male as Teddy is female. Just another layer of artifice to dig through.
