I spun out into the median and he spun out onto the shoulder. There was quite a bit of damage to the back corner of my car and his whole driver’s door was dented in. 

I got out of my car and went to see if he was ok, realizing in my adrenaline-fueled brain that I had not paid car insurance since I’d gotten divorced a couple months before (it had be auto-deducted from a shared account). 

The accident was definitely my fault, and I was almost certainly not insured. 

He crawled out of his passenger side and sort of stage whispered, “Come closer.”  This was not a guy you willingly got closer to on a city street, let alone after punting him off the road. He was tall, really skinny white guy with scabs on his head and face who couldn’t stand still for half a second. 

I asked if he was okay, and he again just whispered, “Come here.”  So I sidled a little closer, until we were standing at the trunk of his car, across from one another. 

I started to apologize and he cut me off and said, “I have five thousand dollars worth of crack in my trunk that you can have if you don’t call the cops.”  

I considered for a second, but realized I didn’t know whether five grand worth of crack was like a golf ball-worth or a the size of a big bag of rice, and I probably shouldn’t carry that back across the highway.

Communism is on the same political axis as capitalism. They are measures of how we distribute goods. 

The State Communism we mean when we talk about “communism” is on a different axis, one with Democracy, various forms of monarchy, and dictatorships. They address how a country is ruled, but not how it distributes goods. 

We tend to blame communism for the sins of military dictatorships, when we aren’t actually addressing the concept of whether communalism is a good or a bad thing.  

I think there’s a reasonable point to be made about whether certain forms of  agricultural and industrial communal structures led by a charismatic, unifying leader, tend to allow for the quick development of a fascist government,

If you completed what you had been convinced was an accredited medical school program, you aren’t lying when you apply for a job as a surgical resident. 

I don’t think this man should be held to hire standard of understanding what a rescue diving training class is than the people handing out the bogus certifications."
UnresolvedMysteries,ff0vf1u,t1_ff0v9ft,1579472671.0,"He did have a certificate of completion for a rescue diving course, didn’t he?"
UnresolvedMysteries,ff0trt9,t1_ff0s9io,1579472219.0,"People are constantly judging others’ behavior based on what they think people’s reactions are when they are guilty vs. when they are innocent. 

The problem comes when 99.999% of what we know of how a murderer acts comes from people who are pretending to be murderers. 

It’s easy to say the guy was acting guilty when we know he was guilty, but the narrator pretending the guy was trying to act innocent, etc. was just trying to make the video fit his narrative."
UnresolvedMysteries,ff0kdq6,t1_feuvvni,1579469694.0,"To be fair, he was dealing with tides he didn’t understand. It’s not bizarre to think someone on the boat could help her, if you didn’t know she wasn’t breathing. 

Hell, panicking and returning to the experts is not entirely indicative of guilt, anyway, just bad coping skills in an emergency."
UnresolvedMysteries,ff0j3sw,t1_feunlon,1579469358.0,"He is certainly guilty of cowardice and maybe punishing her for knocking his mask off, but I’ve never been able to shake the thought that his story and the “bear hug” story could describe the same incident.  I’ve known plenty of guys who like to convince people they are experts at something and then fall to pieces when the slightest pressure was applied. 

The quotes are damning, but not conclusively so, IMO. My understanding is that he hadn’t received proper training to deal with open-water dives, and likely didn’t know what to do when someone was floundering around fighting a current. 

It just seems so implausible a crime. If you’d planned it, you’d have gotten further from the crowd and made sure she was dead. You could simply say you got lost and separated. No need to grapple the woman next to the dive rope and hope she didn’t get rescued by someone else."
UnresolvedMysteries,ff0g0sa,t1_fey3jfy,1579468564.0,"That could have meant a ton of different things. That he thought the cop found something, etc.  Its perfectly natural to look at someone in a startled way when they open a radio line, and it’s perfect natural to have an, “Oh shit,” moment when the cops escalate a situation."
UnresolvedMysteries,ff0fin9,t1_fewkjbc,1579468387.0,That narrator was jumping to all kinds of ridiculous assumptions.
UnresolvedMysteries,ff0axxf,t1_feyn702,1579467010.0,I don’t think so. It looks like a woman to me.
