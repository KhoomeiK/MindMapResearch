corgi,fdao5si,t1_fdanhvz,1578248302.0,Yeah never new indoor parks let alone and indoor dog park and pub was a thing til I moved to NC
corgi,fdamfxm,t1_fdalx1l,1578247709.0,I felt the same but we found a nice indoor one that requires vet records and aggressive dogs are removed from the area swiftly plus there is a fee per visit or monthly fee too so you don’t get too many wild  crazy pups
corgi,fdaa3zr,t1_fda9xem,1578243522.0,Well she is a dog and we are parked if that counts?
corgi,fda8yse,t1_fda8hki,1578243180.0,They wouldn’t open an account with a deposit of treats :(. The dog park is actually an indoor park/pub.
corgi,fda15lu,t1_fd9zg0a,1578240477.0,Thank you! We are actually about to head out to the indoor dogpark / pub we have here in Greensboro for a small dog event. Sometimes soon they will have another corgi takeover day.
