If you had herpes, chlamydia, HPV or gonorrhoea you’d know. (Source: I’ve had that shit and HPV and Herpes is a thing for life, you can only treat the symptoms not the virus)

HIV is different you can’t know till you know. If you pick up some chick at the club and end up having sex with no condom or you are not sure it held the tension or whatever -> go and get tested for HIV.  

If you are in a starting relationship and you want to commit and start having sex without using condoms and know for sure it’s good to just get tested for peace of mind."
AskMenOver30,fft0idb,t3_euubx0,1580200572.0,I don’t get regularly tested. If it doesn’t itch or puss or you don’t have visible HPV warts why go?

If you want to start writing again I suggest seeking out inspiration through books, collected works of poetry, art galleries and walks. Being able to write is the biggest gift we have."
AskMenOver30,ffrrlo0,t1_ffr0bhu,1580164269.0,Have you stopped reading?
