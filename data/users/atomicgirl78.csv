I am sorry if this was not helpful. Bra's are very subjective to the individual. I should have remembered that.

dbtselfhelp,fdlmjvm,t3_elzfw6,1578527411.0,We did RA/EA in group yesterday and my takeaway is RA is my acknowledgment of the situation-and I have the choice to use WI and EA along with DT skills. And if I do not choose to do the above-that is okay.

bulletjournal,fdhf5sr,t3_eldmye,1578421347.0,This is mos def a phenomenon that plagues us all at some point or another. I struggle with perfectionism and recently whilst cleaning out a scary closet I came across a bunch of old journals-and you know what I discovered? The pages I thought were terrible and ugly etc etc were some of my favorites! That shows me that I cannot relay on the instant judgement and just do what makes me happy. This is a journey and it does not happen overnight. The last suggestion is to try and not compare your journal to anyone else's-which is super fucking hard-however it helps with the freak out at least imho.
