The second refinery  is just there to make rocket fuel, and it does so using coal liquefaction. I did this because it adds an extra use for coal, and because I thought that the greater proportion of heavy/light oil that coal liquefaction gives you would make it more efficient, although apparently that isn't the case.

AskPhysics,ffrjev1,t1_ffqrtz5,1580159234.0,"For the time being, the observable universe continues to grow, because the current Hubble distance (at which an object appears to recede from us at the speed of light) is smaller than the cosmological event horizon (the distance beyond which a photon, emitted today, would be unable to ever reach Earth). That means that there are photons which, despite currently having net motion away from us, will eventually fall within the Hubble distance and become able to travel toward us.

As time passes though, the Hubble distance approaches the event horizon, until they become equal at t=infinity. That sets the limit on the furthest objects we'll ever be able to see (which is surprisingly close - the total amount of visible galaxies will only be about double the number we see today).

At the same time, as you correctly say, distant objects will grow more and more redshifted till they become functionally invisible. But they never truly disappear - with an imaginary, infinitely-powerful telescope able to image arbitrarily long wavelengths at arbitrarily low brightnesses, we'd still be able to see these objects.

This may be easier to follow with a [figure](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgrYL.png). We are the black circle; the cyan circle represents a distant source at a distance of 20 giga-lightyears. A long time in the past, we were instead at the white circle, and the source at the purple one, a little over 5 giga-lightyears away.

In a static universe, photons emitted by the source at that time would travel to us along the dashed orange line. Instead, due to the expansion of the universe, they follow the solid orange line, which initially moves away from us. Eventually, they cross into the darker-green region, which is bounded by the Hubble distance, and their path turns back towards us.

In a [similar diagram](https://i.imgur.com/yiBDa.png), you can clearly see how the Hubble distance and event horizon converge in the far future.

askscience,ffbmk9t,t1_ffbi48z,1579772812.0,"I'm not sure what you think I'm unfairly stating as fact.

For a variety of reasons (see [this excellent comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6488wb/i_dont_want_to_be_anti_science_but_i_am_doubtful/dg05wx4) for a summary), our preferred theory for explaining our astronomical observations is the existence of an as-yet undiscovered new type of particle, and it has been for almost fifty years. There are alternatives, generally involving extensions or modifications to general relativity, but to date none of these have been able to explain the observed data as well as particulate DM does ([See also...](https://www.xkcd.com/1758/)).

The WIMP miracle is also established theory, and it comes from doing the calculations to predict how the dark matter particle behaves in the early universe. See [here](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/july-2015/miraculous-wimps) for an overview, and the 'As dark matter' section of the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles) for a more detailed explanation of why WIMPS reproduce the observed DM abundance.

But as I said in my previous comment (now with added emphasis):

>a weakly interacting particle is one of the leading DM **candidates**

So I am not claiming that WIMPS are the DM particle, only that there are good theoretical motivations for believing they might be, and so they are the ones we should look for first. And as I also said, we have been building detectors, like [LUX](http://luxdarkmatter.org/) and its successor [LUX-ZEPLIN](http://lz.ac.uk/), which are designed specifically to look for WIMPS. But so far they haven't found any evidence of WIMPS, and unless that changes they will eventually fall out of favour. At that point, research would move to focus more on other candidates, for example the [axion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion), instead.

Finally, you appear to misunderstand what the purpose of a scientific theory is. I don't believe you'd refer to the theories of gravity or evolution as ""theories at best"". A theory is nothing more or less than our best explanation of the available data. It doesn't, and cannot, claim to be fact, because it's always possible that new data could one day be found that the theory cannot explain, and at that point it would have to be modified or replaced. So it is for dark matter."

But there is a very interesting coincidence that a dark matter particle that interacts via a force of similar strength to the weak force, automatically gets produced with the right abundance to match the amount of dark matter required by large-scale cosmology. That's fascinating, because it means there's a direct link between the particle physics and the overall composition of the universe, which seems unlikely to have arisen by chance.

So, it's because of this so-called ""WIMP miracle"" that a weakly interacting particle is one of the leading DM candidates. But we should be able to exploit it to detect the particle, and attempts to do so thus far have failed. While the jury is still out for the time being, people are starting to look at alternative particle physics models more seriously."

You'd probably dedicate a whole belt each of iron and copper to this build anyway, so the difference in copper usage is probably not worth worrying about for a base big enough to necessitate beaconed builds.

Edit: here is a design of mine which uses some wacky belt gymnastics to squeeze 6 pairs of machines into an 8-beacon layout, so that you get two blue belts of circuits out. The blueprint includes debug entities, so place it in the map editor if you want to check it out. Hovering over the bottom-left power pole will show the throughput in the last 10 seconds. It doesn't quite achieve full compression because sometimes an inserter will swing at a bad moment leaving a small gap, but you shouldn't see below 895 items/10 sec (out of the theoretical 900).

However, there's also another problem, which is less obvious and something I didn't know before. I found that you also need a second *output* inserter for the circuits. With a single one, even though it can just about keep up (i.e. the output buffer doesn't become overfilled with circuits), something changes about the behaviour of the input inserters that means the assembler runs dry of both wire and iron.

Building this way means that the outermost lanes of belt which you're splitting off to feed the factories will become depleted of materials.

Of course, the better solution is to build your reactor in a landfilled lake, but I couldn't find one big enough :D

My trains are pretty spaghetti, although that's partly by design as I find cityblock-type grids pretty boring (and incidentally, they make pathfinding more UPS-expensive). This is actually the first and only map I've played on (albeit for close to 400 hours...), so it's been a learning experience as far as making an efficient train network is concerned. I have some ideas about how to improve things, but they'll have to wait for a new map...

Regarding FPS, mine also tanks in certain areas of the base, like zooming out at the nuclear power. I think it does make sense though - there is some CPU overhead in preparing objects to be rendered, and the more of them there are on screen the less CPU time will be available for processing the game update itself.

Also, Factorio is surprisingly hungry for VRAM especially if you have high-res sprites turned on. If you don't have enough, the game will be swapping sprites from system RAM. Since it is apparently the case that UPS is bottlenecked by memory bandwidth more than raw CPU horsepower, the competition for bandwidth from the GPU will hurt performance too."

My train network is pretty spaghetti, and I made some dumb layout decisions that mean trains have to cross paths more than would be ideal.
