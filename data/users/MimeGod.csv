""It is true that the upper echelons of the military tilt right. My own [Dempsey’s] research confirmed that about two-thirds of majors and higher-ranking officers identify as conservative, as previous studies found. But that tilt becomes far less pronounced when you expand the pool of respondents. That is because only 32 percent of the Army’s enlisted soldiers consider themselves conservative, while 23 percent identify as liberal and the remaining 45 percent are self-described moderates. These numbers closely mirror the ideological predilections of the civilian population. . . .""

""In a 2009 survey of 4,000 Army officers, Heidi Urben, an active-duty officer and doctoral candidate at Georgetown University, found that between 1976 and 1996, the share of senior military officers identifying itself as Republican jumped from one-third to two-thirds, while those claiming to be moderates fell from 46% to 22%.

Senior military officers who described themselves as liberal fell from 16% in 1976 to 3% in 1996.""

Suspicion of a crime is generally enough, even if nobody is convicted. Since its handled in civil court where the burden of proof is much lower.

Unless you think we're currently in a major recession, there's no way Keynesians would support the current policies.

The current Keynesian policy should be to lower the deficit (and ideally reduce the actual debt) by cutting spending and increasing taxes.
