depressed,fdidkok,t3_elisfu,1578440481.0,"I did an inpatient program, and a partial program.

The impatient program is very overwhelming/underwhelming. There are restrictions on what you can wear and bring. No shoelaces, belts, cellphones, ect. Hospitals are cramped and lack all forms of privacy: no doors on the bathrooms, check-in every 15 minutes.

The partial program was better. I got to stay at home and just attend program during day. Then I stepped down to group daily for a few weeks and then groups twice a week. It's both dehumanizing and enlightening...

If you go in for an evaluation they should help steer you towards the appropriate program for your intensity level. 

Real Advice: Go sooner rather than later. Start getting help now before you wake up in the inpatient hospital. Even if you just start by getting yourself a therapist and psychologist do it today. Groups can be helpful therapy is worth it.

If cost is a concern, find an AA meeting... Even if you aren't alcoholic and just share your story and listen to others share theirs. It's cheap / free group counseling."

Accidents will happen, you won't be a perfect dog parent. But they are incredibly forgiving, a lesson to be learned and practiced. 

It won't solve your problems, but I think life is better with dogs.

Often we lock up those with mental health issues instead of getting them treatment and meds. 

Visits to a mental health Dr are specialist visits making treatment expensive even with insurance.

Meds can also be expensive and often we have to take 3 or 4 scripts.

The only time mental health is really brought up is as a scapegoat for some mass shooting, but even then, nothing is done about it.
