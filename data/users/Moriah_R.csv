I agree with u/SchwarzerKaffee Give her space if she's asked for it, but be supportive. Oh and try not to worry yourself too much. It's a cycle. The rough time ends eventually. You might remind her of that too, because we sometimes can forget when going through the rough of it."

Sometimes being mixed sucks because it feels like you don't belong anywhere. Neither group accepts you fully.

You may not know what it's like to be Asian American, but your wife doesn't know what it's like to be mixed, so you both have to try to be more empathetic towards your son. 

You can't force culture on anyone. You can only share it with them, when they're ready."

AskReddit,felb9kb,t3_epl2z7,1579218135.0,"Back in the day when everyone was trying to make a new ""Tycoon"" game, I played Cruise Ship Tycoon.

The goal was to build a cruise ship full of shops, activities and such, hire workers and keep everyone on board happy. Well, sometimes there would be a customer who would complain about EVERYTHING. Nothing could make them happy. The bathrooms aren't fancy enough. The arcade is too far away. They need more decorative ferns. All that stuff costs money!

 So, for the tough customers I would just pick them up and throw them off the top tier of my cruise ship. It would be smooth sailing from there.

We'd arrive at our destination port a few passengers short, the remaining people would get off, new passengers would board. The happy days at sea continued."

schizophrenia,fe5rrh0,t3_enp4lc,1578873618.0,"I'm watching the new season of You on Netflix. It's super creepy, but there's one character who is Bipolar who I'm really hoping nothing bad happens to. 

And there's another show on Netflix called Spinning Out I think it's a drama about an ice skater who is also bipolar. It looks good, but I can't recommend it or not as I haven't seen it yet. 

As for movies..

There is this movie called Elizabeth Blue about a woman with Schizophrenia. I was amazed by how much I could relate to the main character. She has more of a flat affect compared to me, but she also struggles with medication, and trying to have things that people without this illness have like a relationship or children. 

I Never Promised You a Rose Garden is a great movie from the 70's about a girl in a mental institution who kinda has a secret world of her own. 

Splendor in the Grass is a CLASSIC about a girl who has a breakdown after her first love. 

There's this great comedy from the 90s called The Dream Team about 4 mental patients who are left in NYC on their own when their doctor disappears.

Lars and the Real Girl is a sweet movie about a man with a delusion that the doll he ordered is his girlfriend. 

What's Eating Gilbert Grape. It's never outright stated, but the main character is one of the best depictions of depression I've ever seen. He's basically going through the motions of life with his dysfunctional family.

Finally, Feed is a great movie about a girl with an eating disorder. The way it's set up, it can be taken metaphorically or it can seem like she is hallucinating much of the time.

Oh wait! I have one more. The Neverending Story. It's a kid's show but when I watched it again as an adult the undercurrent about depression REALLY hit me. It's about a beast called The Nothing that is destroying EVERYTHING and leaving nothing in it's wake. But before it does this is seems to strikes people with an apathy. They can't move. They can't run. Nor do they want to. The main character has just lost his mom too, so I saw it as him working through his grief while reading a story that seemed to be about what he was experiencing inside."
AmItheAsshole,fe4yi4s,t3_eno5q8,1578864006.0,"The only reason he was uncomfortable is because he has no sex. Or he's just an idiot. Either way, do what you want, and he can mind his own business.

bipolar,fdyzkbh,t3_encbw8,1578785196.0,"I feel like this was a trend when I was in high school. A few celebs came out as bipolar and suddenly it was the ""cool"" illness to have.

No one would have even cared or believed that I had it if I'd told them because I was the opposite of cool.

So...I guess it's annoying. Mostly because I feel like they don't know what that word means. But, big deal. They're ignorant. Ignorance is nothing new."

Sorry, but if you have children and both had the same upbringing and opportunities, and one goes out of their way to piss you off, it's probably because they feel they can never measure up to your standards or everything the other kid has achieved. 

So they just stop trying and sometimes do the opposite. 

I think if you think about it, you might come to realize you had these roles assigned for the children long before they were conscious of them. I'm sure your daughter has known for some time how you really feel about her. Don't you think that hurts?"

If one could choose to have schizophrenia...

then doesn't that mean one could simply choose not to have it as well?

And who among us here wouldn't make that choice then?

Seems to me there's a lot more to this who illness than what we think. Though, thoughts can be part of it, I'm sure."
schizophrenia,fdozw7l,t3_em9yxv,1578616693.0,"You know what? I've had a thought!

Like, if before I was born perhaps someone told me about the life I would have. And they said, ""If you choose to go to be born on Earth you will be born mentally ill. Making this choice means someone else will be spared. Do you do it?""

I often think that maybe that's what happened. Like maybe we were the only ones strong enough to carry this particular burden. I don't know if it's true, but I suppose it's as plausible a theory as any."
