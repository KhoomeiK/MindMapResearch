houston,ff6p9wd,t1_ff6h17f,1579632033.0,Ok I knew the euth drug was pink or red colored because I’ve been there for my pets during the process. It’s still a bit weird that they are both closely colored. Is there any color they could make it that it couldn’t possibly be mistaken for something else? Could they make the drug something that is required to mix with something else first? I don’t know anything about pharmacology.

houston,ff3qkk4,t1_ff3e1ms,1579546711.0,I would also add that anyone that has to take name brand medication should look at the manufacturers website. Sometimes they may have a discount card or offer a percentage off of you present the info displayed on a digital discount card in your name. It’s pretty easy to do. Even if you have insurance it could take something off of the copay.

I will say that she is a pretty talented flautist. I’m not joking by the way."
ImGoingToHellForThis,ff1u87q,t1_ff07x5t,1579486298.0,I’m sick of seeing this dumb idiot everywhere. She isn’t sexy she is disgusting. 99 times out of 100 it’s pure laziness and a lack of knowledge when it comes to physical fitness and healthy eating. There are two subject I believe that should be mandatory for all high school and college grads: health/nutrition and critical thinking. We are completely clueless when it comes to physical health. Critical thinking can change a lot in the way people form arguments and carry themselves. I believe requiring both would add a world of confidence. It wouldn’t change America because our education system is just as broken as the health care system but it would a start in the right direction.

Shutting down arguments and opinions so they are more difficult to be heard by others besides yourself makes us stagnate in our progression. 

This whole movement will die off sooner or later. Society will then decide what stays and goes besides a group of people behind a computer screen so hell bent on keeping everyone on their side of the aisle happy that crap like this happens."

OldManDog,fei9kd4,t1_fei6x6p,1579133336.0,"It really is heart breaking. However, at least you get to see them get old and they aren’t taken from you too soon. I’ve had dogs get old and need to be let go of and I’ve had dogs need to be let go of too soon and letting go too soon is so much worse. 

I started loving dachshunds because of rescuing an old man. He was brought to me because they knew I’d take care of him. I named him Dude and fell in love with that cranky toot. I got 3 wonderful years. 

Just know that Ted adores you too. He also understands more than anyone when it’s time to let him go. 

All that aside I hope you get a few more years with him. Little dogs can truck it longer than big dogs so you never know how long they can go!"
