Being an old mobile home as it was, the cabinets had the old metal handles that looked like two ""T""s put together, the bottom part of the T being where the handle connected to the cabinet/drawer. They were supposed to look ornate, and so they were full of curves like an ivy sort of pattern. Under the sink were a set of cabinets per usual, but also 2 fake drawers that had the handle but didn't pull out or anything. Queue young me late at night in some basketball shorts reaching over the sink to the cabinet where the cups were kept. Stepping away from the sink and turning away too quickly, my dick and the loose shorts fabric got caught on the fake drawer handle and since I didn't realise it I quickly jerked away to turn and well, tore my skin. Never again did I treat those handles lightly. I was careful of them until the day I moved out."
