Sending a hug your way stranger. IDK what's gonna happen but the world needs to come together or something. Or else this is all gonna be too hard."

politics,ffb29ad,t1_ffalwjv,1579749972.0,"Amen to that. Currently serving and the leadership truly erks me. I think this is a great country, but what is happening in the White House disappoints  me. Fills me full of hopelessness and some anger at what they're currently doing. I want change, for a brighter future, and no more of this inconsequential action by those in charge. They should face consequences when they do the wrong things."

movies,febfqu3,t3_e6l8bc,1578958336.0,That final scene where he reads her letter and he breaks down was gut wrenching. Such fantastic acting. On both leads. Honestly everyone involved did so great with their acting here. That last scene though was incredible.
movies,fe99g2h,t1_fe8szni,1578935536.0,Such a great effing film. Sandler was fantastic and the whole story felt different and fearless in what it was doing. It's one of those films that sticks with you after you've finished watching it. That's crap that it doesn't get some recognition.
