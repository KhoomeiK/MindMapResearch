xqcow,ff0cf3i,t1_fezpmmm,1579467583.0,"Did you ignore my second point about how people who grow up watching dub will usually prefer dub over sub, unless the dub is atrociously bad. You probably saw sub before you watched dub which is why you like sub more."
xqcow,feznmwh,t1_fex6g6s,1579459390.0,"Dragonball Z was one of those animes that are much better to watch in dub, King Kai and Goku's voice are so high pitched in sub. Also, many people watched it on Nickelodeon and other channels which had the dubbed version so the dubbed version is more nostalgic to them"

HomeworkHelp,felvmi8,t1_felv64q,1579232057.0,"2/3y - 1/3y = 6 - 3

1/3y = 3     (subtract the fractions and the numbers)

y = 9      (multiply y by 3 so it becomes a whole number miltiply the other side by 3)

I just realised i multiplied 3 by 2 when writing this out it was just me being dumb thank you for the help."
HomeworkHelp,feluogk,t1_felucs6,1579231379.0,Thank you very much. Is the answer y = 6?

Don't get me wrong i love him and watch his vids as much as the next guy but you gotta call him out when he does something wrong. It is what is if he doesnt want to be as active on his channel as much as we want him to thats up to him, but he shouldnt be suprised when some of us call him out on it."
eezygang,fdf3c0q,t1_fdf341d,1578352356.0,"Exactllyy atleast if your about to post a highlight vid make it recent not one from half a year ago. Its also crazy how on his twitch he has past broadcasts set to subscriber only so even if i wanted to watch his VODs i would have to subscribe.

Edit: Checked his twitch and seems like he turned off subscriber only recently what a coincidence."
