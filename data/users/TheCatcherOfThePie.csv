Probably the best known work of anarchist literature is *The Conquest of Bread* by Peter Kropotkin. Other names to google are Bakunin, Bookchin, Chomsky, and Emma Goldman. See r/anarchy101 for other entry-level resources and a place to ask questions. The [anarchist library](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/special/index) has a lot of free resources, including many by the authors listed above.

Murray Rothbard's *The Anatomy of the State* is probably the best known work of the paradoxically-named anarcho-capitalism. Also influential is Robert Nozick's *Anarchy, State and Utopia*. Friedrich Hayek and David Friedman are two names to google if you want to look into the economic arguments for free market capitalism. r/goldandblack and r/libertarian are probably good places to look on reddit, r/ancap101 for introductory resources.

The place to start with communism is the Communist manifesto. If that whetted your appetite, move onto its big brother Capital (sometimes referred to by its German name *Das Kapital*). Kapital can be found at [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm), and the communist manifesto [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm). Other names to google are Lenin, Mao, Gramsci and Zizek. r/communism101 for questions, and [marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/) for free resources.

Fascism doesn't really put a whole lot of emphasis on theory, but I guess you could look into ""super-fascist"" Julius Evola or Nazi philosopher Karl Schmitt for an attempt to give philosophical underpinning to fascism. For outside perspectives on fascism, Umberto Eco's [*Ur-Fascism*](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjdhunbu_fmAhU8UxUIHc9mD3cQFjACegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw1tXZpM_48dlCk9Fbwu2UBt) (pdf link) and Robert Paxton's *The Anatomy of Fascism* attempt to pin a definition to a notoriously slippery (group of) ideology(ies).

My prick was stuck in you for hours, fucking in and out under your upturned rump. I felt your fat sweaty buttocks under my belly and saw your flushed face and mad eyes. At every fuck I gave you your shameless tongue came bursting out through your lips and if a gave you a bigger stronger fuck than usual, fat dirty farts came spluttering out of your backside. You had an arse full of farts that night, darling, and I fucked them out of you, big fat fellows, long windy ones, quick little merry cracks and a lot of tiny little naughty farties ending in a long gush from your hole. It is wonderful to fuck a farting woman when every fuck drives one out of her. I think I would know Nora’s fart anywhere. I think I could pick hers out in a roomful of farting women. It is a rather girlish noise not like the wet windy fart which I imagine fat wives have. It is sudden and dry and dirty like what a bold girl would let off in fun in a school dormitory at night. I hope Nora will let off no end of her farts in my face so that I may know their smell also.

You say when I go back you will suck me off and you want me to lick your cunt, you little depraved blackguard. I hope you will surprise me some time when I am asleep dressed, steal over to me with a whore’s glow in your slumberous eyes, gently undo button after button in the fly of my trousers and gently take out your lover’s fat mickey, lap it up in your moist mouth and suck away at it till it gets fatter and stiffer and comes off in your mouth. Sometimes too I shall surprise you asleep, lift up your skirts and open your drawers gently, then lie down gently by you and begin to lick lazily round your bush. You will begin to stir uneasily then I will lick the lips of my darling’s cunt. You will begin to groan and grunt and sigh and fart with lust in your sleep. Then I will lick up faster and faster like a ravenous dog until your cunt is a mass of slime and your body wriggling wildly.

Goodnight, my little farting Nora, my dirty little fuckbird! There is one lovely word, darling, you have underlined to make me pull myself off better. Write me more about that and yourself, sweetly, dirtier, dirtier.”
