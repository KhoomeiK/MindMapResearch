You see, there's actually a pretty strong and evidential line of thought which suggests that Donald Trumps rise, as well as the success of an anti-science GOP platform which panders to the lowest common denominator by revolving around Guns, God, Gays and Abortion as a distraction (while fleecing the poor on the issues that really matter), ***is largely due to the less educated and rural populations reacting to years of feeling belittled by what they consider ""lefitist, liberal snobs"".***

You might have noticed this in frequent tropes whereby states and cities which have more modern and forward thinking policies are derided. Trump has even institutionalized this sentiment by ridiculing entire states like California, because it plays so well to this base....a base that feels like it's been bullied and forced to accept progressive legislation and attitudes.

What's the solution? I'm not certain.....but I do know that it's not more of the same that got us into this mess to begin with."
