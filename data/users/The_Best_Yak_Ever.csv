AskReddit,ffk8jnj,t3_eu25wu,1580018715.0,"My mom was in the hospital fifty miles away. I was 19. We were pretty sure this was it. I was home alone. My parents’ house is big. It’s off the beaten path on a small lagoon. My dad had been staying up at the hospital.

That night, I went to bed about 1am. I was playing on my laptop. My room was in a separate wing of the house. It can be sealed off with a single locking door. The door was shut but not locked. I have always been scared of the dark, so I had the lights in my wing on. So was the closet light. As I was messing around on Gamefaqs, I saw the lights in my wing turn off. All of them. The band of light under the door, went black. I hopped up in bed and stared at it.

My bedroom door was unlocked and I was debating getting up to lock it, when the shut door slammed. As in, it sounded like someone straight up kicked the bottom of the door with all their strength. I remember squeaking in shock. It took me about six seconds to be up on both feet with a blade about four paces back and just right of the door. I remember thinking if the door opened, I could be on whoever it was almost instantly. I was also silently cursing that there was no light under the door anymore. No way to see the shadow of whoever was out there.

Nothing happened. I was fighting off the fear of the situation and stupidly decided that going on offense was all that was left. I didn’t have a phone in my room, and my Nokia was in another wing or the house charging. I threw the door open with my knife low and my left hand in a guarded position. There was no one there. I tossed the hallway light switch on. There was no one in my wing. There was no one in the house. The burglar alarm was still on. Confused, I turned on the main house lights and sealed the wing off with the locking door. I went back to my room and just sat there with my laptop open. My bedroom door now had a slight bow in it.

A couple hours passed with me warily laying in bed. Around 3 am, the lights under the door, went dark. Now I was terrified. My knife seemed pretty insignificant and my previous dumb courage had ran out. I scooted my bed (no easy task) against my bedroom door, grateful the door opened inward. I retreated to my closet and waited for the sun to come up.

When the skylight in my room got bright, my courage returned and I moved the bed and exited my room. The wing door had been unlocked, which required a key. I heard footsteps coming down the stairs in the main house and realized my dad was home. I felt a little foolish as obviously he had been responsible for turning the lights off the second time. I lead my greeting with “oh, so it was you who turned all the lights off.” He looked at me and said, “I got home about ten minutes ago.”

I have zero clue what happened that night but it never happened before that night or after. My parents built the house and nothing untoward had ever taken place there. My bedroom door at my parents house still has a bow in it to this day (this was over fifteen years ago). My mom is still alive, and for that, I’m extremely grateful."

Seriously though. Women tend to follow their instincts. If none of them want to hang out with you, there is likely a reason as to why. There is likely something off putting about this guy (aside from this insufferable post). I mean, any one who uses “ur” probably has a collection of hair and toenail clippings from their crushes, squirreled away under their pillow. 

It may be that he’s trying for women completely out of his league. Life isn’t fair and the hard truth is that people tend to end up with partners that are their equals looks-wise. It’s not PC to bring it up, but I always cringe when I see some guy like this, who is a minor leaguer, set their heart on the majors, and then get all resentful when it doesn’t work out.

I have a friend from work who buckled down, and exercised herself to an incredible body. She is by no means a skinny little flower. The girl is *built* and athletic. She also works to be an inspiration to others that it is possible to transform yourself. She never once, has degraded heavy people.

TumblrInAction,ffjelkd,t1_ffihvmu,1579996629.0,"A lot of us still do! Problem is, we have these FA and HAES movements that have been co-opted by people who want to use it more as a weapon than for self-confidence. There’s nothing wrong about wanting to be happy about your size. But there is something wrong with trying to dictate to everyone what they need to perceive as beautiful and healthy, and tearing down anyone who disagrees. 

There is an image around here of an obese woman wearing nothing but underwear on the subway, with “beautiful” scrawled all over her in sharpie, while some poor chap is trying to hide his face, not wanting to be in the photo. She declares anyone who doesn’t agree as “fatphobic” and demands everyone see her as just as healthy as a fitness model. 

There is also a cruel undercurrent in the aforementioned communities that seems to require berating and humiliating lithe and pretty women. They’re told they have eating disorders, that they need to “eat a sandwich,” that they aren’t “real women.” Basically, they’re guilty of all the bullying behaviors they claim to be against. So it reads like they aren’t happy with their own self-confidence, unless lean women are mocked and suffer. This is super apparent when a girl who had been overweight, loses it. Instead of congratulating her hard work and newly acquired self-confidence, the HAES types tend to attack. 

The idea of HAES, is kind of a misnomer, as they are usually openly hostile to the idea of lean women with muscle, being healthy. A YouTube yoga instructor I like, was recently savaged by an obese coworker of mine (after I made the catastrophic mistake of saying I enjoy her videos)  for being an “anorexic skinny bitch.” Yeahhhhh... no. She’s in phenomenal shape, and is classically beautiful. The tone of the FA and HAES movements so often reeks of self-loathing and envy. It’s almost always like they’re trying to convince themselves, as much (if not more) than the rest of us. It’s not a good look. 

Sorry for the rant, but I’m hearing more and more of this type of bullying behavior in real life where I work. I have girl friends who are in amazing shape because they put the *work* in. My closest friend and coworker has been teaching me yoga (and she looks like the stereotypical yoga instructor). I’m blown away when my heavier friends savage her behind her back, because she obviously has an eating disorder (she doesn’t)."

I can see my abs again, and it helped relieve the load on my old injury. Now a mere 100 lbs would account for *over* half of me, so I’d imagine it’d work wonders for this poor woman. Anyone who would let her suffer to feel vindicated in their own obesity, is simply cruel"
TumblrInAction,ff89df1,t3_erslp5,1579669856.0,"Christ.... this is horrible! Just horrible! This person should have only been your *FRIEND* not a lover! And at this point, if you are not aroused by your partner, and are not attracted to their sex organs, you aren’t in a good relationship. And your PARTNER should accept that too. Two years with a sex life that is wholly unsatisfactory and more terrified of how you may be “transphobic” rather than accepting you aren’t attracted to trans women. This is so not okay on just about every level imaginable. Conversion therapy?! Sexually broken?! No, you’re just not turned on by this person, because she doesn’t have the parts that make you hot, and that’s okay! No one should ever expect you to sacrifice yourself for them. This person is likely the victim of emotional abuse."

AskReddit,ff84n69,t3_es57cz,1579665877.0,"My wife was shaking me awake, her voice tinged with panic. “Yak! Wake up! There’s someone in the house!” (Yes, she calls me Yak).

I snap to it pretty quickly. My hearing isn’t the best (a lifetime of shooting and power tools), but I *felt* the reverberations of an uninvited and wholly unwelcome nighttime visitor in the hardwood foyer. I remember my brain not being entirely awake, as I was having a little difficulty stringing together full coherent sentences. 

I slipped out of bed, and quietly kneeled, reaching under the bed frame, retrieving my rifle. I had built the AR platform as a home defense weapon. It had a 900 lumen light attached to its quad rail. I turned it on and swung open the bedroom door.

I saw the guy’s shadow in the moonlight, followed by the guy himself.  He was shorter than me, and had a pudgy build. I swung the rifle into line, the vivid and bright beam of light slicing the darkness, illuminating the intruder, blinding him. My brain wasn’t putting words together very well, so what I got out made precisely zero sense.

“You’ve woken the fucking dead!” I growled at him. 

“W-wrong place!” He stammered (or something like that), and turned heels and ran for it. 

Wrong place indeed... I remember one of my thoughts vividly. I didn’t want blood on my carpet... it’s such a strange thing to worry about all things considered, but that’s what I thought. I slowly moved to the front door, and switched off my rifle’s light. I saw him turn the corner at the end of my street, and vanish off into the night. 

We called the police, but by that time, he was long gone. We should have done so sooner, but we were muzzle-headed from sleep.

In hindsight, I’m glad I never covered the trigger, instead keeping my finger indexing the receiver. The house we had bought had been in foreclosure, remaining empty for three or so years. I believe this guy had been sleeping in the empty house on cold nights. I don’t believe he was there to harm me or anyone else. I think he just wanted a warm place to sleep :-(."

No, I love what I see in the mirror and enjoy that women like looking at me too (it helps to have women friends point this out to me, as I am pretty oblivious). I’m sure you’re liking what you see after your hard work, and you have every right to be proud of yourself! You’re doing great, keep it up and love your life!"
fatlogic,ff7itxx,t3_ervuu1,1579650560.0,"Rant: Okay, I hate it when larger people tell me I need to eat a fucking sandwich or tell me I’m too skinny. I’m 6’1” and 185 lbs (as of a few minutes ago). When I look in the mirror, I like what I see. I enjoy that I have abs, defined shoulders and biceps, and I’ve been told I have cute haunches. I get positive attention from women, and the only people who berate me seem to be 45 plus year old women who are heavier set. 

When I got up past 200 lbs, I had a little pudge around my midsection and didn’t care for it. Every time someone tells me I need to put on some weight, it’s aggravating and sometimes, hurtful. 

I get that this might seem like a first world problem sort of rant, but hey, I was invited to rant and I rarely miss those types of opportunities!"
fatlogic,ff7frn6,t1_ff70gxc,1579648530.0,"I feel like if I congratulated this person on their weight *gain,* they would call me an asshole... every time I read on this forum, the only subtext I see isn’t anything about positivity. It’s anger, spite, jealousy, and self-loathing poorly masquerading as self-affirmation. It’s sad. But I can’t help but feel that the whole movement is about berating people (women really) who are more classically attractive. 

The irony is that no matter what you look like, there is a man or woman who would love nothing more than to sleep with you. See, I also think that they know that at some level. It’s just not the “right” people who want to sleep with them. Just like Eva Green and Emily Blunt aren’t gonna bang me any time soon (=-( ), Brad Pitt and the Hemsworth boys aren’t going to sleep with them. The sooner they stop trying to dictate to the world what is attractive, and accept no one is entitled to anyone else, the happier they’ll be for it."

It took precisely zero time to realize that there was a pretty significant correlation between the attitude fellow woman and the victim’s physical beauty. The prettier the woman, the more terse, rude, and dismissive she is treated. And then they’d go right back to treating me with kindness and respect. It’s really really sad.
