I wore white docs at my wedding and I’ve got ice king docs I wear more on nights out or with a specific look. I really want some glitter ones next.

Skechers memory foam trainers, they are lightweight and really comfy. I have a plain work pair and a glittery pair I like to wear everyday. 

For games I guess I’m loyal to Nintendo, mainly animal crossing though! 

Phones: apple - I find them easy to use

Tablets: amazon kindle - cheaper and in game purchases are cheaper with amazon coins and sometimes cost less than with apple anyway. 

Amuse for plushies, bought through tofucute. Because I’m a child in an adults body."

depression,fdozz35,t3_emaxm4,1578616747.0,"I’ve been suicidal, depressed and anxious since childhood and I’m nearly 33. Thanks for giving me hope. I plan on writing all the crazy down for the psychiatrist. Currently off sick and this waiting list seems like forever. Work won’t redeploy me until I see the psychiatrist and get better. 

Finally I can have better meds than just basic depression treatment from my GP. I was debating not telling the psychiatrist I think I have autism because I was shot down twice when I brought it up in the past but your story gives me some hope. Tbh I have a massive list of conditions I think I have which makes me think maybe I’m just a hypochondriac? 

I had a difficult couple of days. Occupational health yesterday and a meeting at work with HR today. I cried the whole time and HR described me as “distressed” but I thought I was only a 2/10 on the distressed scale. Has she never seen real distress? So thanks for brightening my shitty day, and I’m so glad you feel better."
ACPocketCamp,fdn7s42,t3_em1k5m,1578579601.0,"Bye Roald, see you back in the cabin 😭 It was useful but I’ve never spent real money in game and don’t plan to start."
depression,fd645f3,t3_ejsoej,1578185274.0,"Total people who reached out to me while I’ve been off sick apart from family: 1 Facebook chat

People who’d share about my funeral and how sad they are - maybe 100? 

It’s not like people don’t know I’m depressed. 

But yeah suicide does pass on the pain, lost my friend last year and it sucks. I’ve promised too many people I love I won’t do that to them. Just wish people would reach out when people are depressed instead of posting that people need to speak to them. You aren’t going to reach out to an old childhood friend when you feel worthless and like a burden."
AmItheAsshole,fd5v5s4,t1_fd3shk8,1578181890.0,I have a what I consider a pretty common “celebrity name” and Facebook made me give my marriage certificate to prove I wasn’t impersonating a celebrity.
childfree,fck43op,t1_fck3h7x,1577716008.0,"Yep, I spent my 20s thinking I might change my mind one day but I have plenty of reasons not to procreate. I guess I didn’t want to be a disappointment to my mum who wants grandkids. 

When I imagine me having a child I worry about me killing it and ending up in prison due to depression so it’s probably the wisest not to. That’s if I made it through the pregnancy without begging for an abortion. I love contraception!"
childfree,fcjx6cl,t3_ehjzrx,1577708951.0,"I’m so glad it’s not just me that feels like this! Can’t imagine having to go through pregnancy and have a parasite for 9 months, then wreck your body in childbirth. 

Often thought maybe I wouldn’t be childfree if I could overcome this but I guess I’m just not maternal and don’t want a kid and neither does my husband."
RPDR_UK,f78xk8u,t1_f76et6h,1573499754.0,"Exactly! Did they not have a chippy at some point when she was in CBB? Like, how do you not know this stuff spending time with brits in CBB/Strictly? Or do celebs not get a chippy?
