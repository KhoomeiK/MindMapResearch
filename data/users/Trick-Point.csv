It you can't find one near your, go hold a sign on an overpass for a few hours.

It matters more than you think."

If you can't find a protest, get a cardboard sign and hold it on an overpass. 

It makes a difference when enough people do it."

SandersForPresident,fehq75o,t1_fehfla5,1579121683.0,"Nah. This was in the news running up to the debate. It's a reasonable assumption that she would get a question related to the issue somehow.

If you get to that point, then it's reasonable to prepare an answer.

You have no facts or evidence for the claim that Warren got questions really. You're just playing into the hands of the oligarchs."

So they waited for the statute of limitations to expire."
3d6,fdewiaf,t3_ekzm9l,1578348061.0,"One way to generate interest is through juxtaposition: put things together that don't seem to go together. For example, Drizzt is a good amounted aligned dark elf, a race which is almost all evil aligned. A classic juxtaposition is the Wizard half-Orc.

It can be within the scope of the character itself, as in the above, or between characters. Maybe you have a Kobold and a Gnome that are best friends, for example (the two races typically hate each other).

You have to come up with compelling reasons for these things to exist, of course. Subverting expectations only works if it's narratively satisfying."
3d6,fdeqvgl,t3_ekuz6u,1578344719.0,">pet mouse from the Urchin background. Itâ€™s much more useful in social situations throughout the levels too, as a mouse is less assuming than a psuedodragon or imp.

For what it's worth, both an the Imp and the Quasit are shape changers. The Imp can change into a rat, a spider, or a raven. A Quasit can into a bat, a centipede, or a toad.

Imps, Quasits and Sprites can all become invisible at will, which largely removes concerns about their natural forms"
3d6,fco66dk,t3_ei8cz9,1577824826.0,"Another way to irritate your DM:

The Find Familiar spell specifies:
>As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

Take note than it doesn't say ""any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you *that you can see*.""

Based on this, my DM allowed me to summon the Familiar in the other side of a door we were trying to get past. Your mileage may vary

Incidentally, we've been exploiting this feature to scout beyond one-way planar portals our campaign is riddled with. We send the familiar through the portal, wait a beat, dismiss it and resummon it to find out what is waiting for us.

Yes, the DM *loves* me."
