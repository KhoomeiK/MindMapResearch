PlannerAddicts,fegfbwo,t1_fdtju93,1579090838.0,Wow that sounds like such a steal! I’m seriously thinking of investing in one.

bulletjournal,fegf6at,t3_eox91o,1579090678.0,Wow these boxes are so satisfying!!!! Great job!
PlannerAddicts,fdslg8y,t1_fdo7aek,1578704710.0,"Very nice! Is it fairly easy to use? And like affordable? I know the machine itself is expensive, but is it decently priced to make like a weekly sticker kit?"

PlannerAddicts,fdo4zum,t3_emdo06,1578599001.0,I love it! Did you use a machine to cut them?

PlannerAddicts,fcalhub,t3_egtbp8,1577571595.0,"Target is my go to for a quick planner. I’ve seen a lot of comments up there that they’re not super cute, but target has definitely stored up their game in terms of cuteness. They also have faux travelers notebook options if I thats you’re thing too!"

PlannerAddicts,fc7c5k8,t1_fc75hya,1577503143.0,SO COOL!
PlannerAddicts,fc7c43p,t1_fc76rkf,1577503112.0,I 100% agree! What kind of Michaels kits do you get? Can you share a picture? I’ve never seen them before.
PlannerAddicts,fc76k6w,t1_fc759xn,1577498892.0,Super cool! I just got a vertical Erin Condren and already bought 2 mini kits to see how it works out for me. I don’t really have much going on. And of course I’ve got major fomo from all the nice kits on Instagram and YouTube.
bulletjournal,fc7528s,t3_egbdgx,1577497737.0,YES I LOVE IT
PlannerAddicts,fc74v4r,t3_eghjyt,1577497585.0,I love this set up! Do you know how you’re going to use your checklists and open boxes?

bulletjournal,fc1je6z,t3_efimt3,1577320525.0,That must be true love!!! Yay! Happy Christmas!
PlannerAddicts,fbtgxrx,t3_ecoxbm,1577078494.0,Expensive makes me think Erin Condren but it’s very rare to find her planners in store — especially at a staples. Maybe Happy Planner? Do you remember if it was coil bound or disc bound?
