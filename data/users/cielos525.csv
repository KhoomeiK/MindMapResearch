IllegallySmolCats,ff4cwbj,t3_ere4d3,1579560640.0,I hope these smol criminals here are being transported to a secure facility and kept under watch 24/7. We need to take these hard criminals off the road.
cats,ff3gyge,t3_erc1po,1579540813.0,Congrats! They are all cute. I hope they'll be spayed/ neutered soon.
IllegallySmolCats,fepjuks,t3_eq8wfe,1579322367.0,"Please for the love of God, someone arrest the smol criminal. I'm scared if he ever gets loose, his cuteness will cause mayhem."
IllegallySmolCats,feob906,t1_fengmvj,1579297693.0,"Darn, we are so screwed then 🥺"
TruckerCats,fensvp6,t1_fenryim,1579290245.0,"Ah, I see. She deserves all the limelight! I was ever so surprised to see that truckers sometimes bunk with cats, opened up a whole new world for me 😊"
AskReddit,fenpmbp,t3_eq1wzh,1579289006.0,A new job. My current one is sucking my soul out. My manager is shit and there is no room for growth. I'm stuck. It's killing me a little everyday to show up at the place I hate with all my heart.
TruckerCats,fenis46,t3_eq2enq,1579285589.0,"Saw Tora again in my Youtube feed yesterday! She is so adorable! <3 
Is she part Persian?"
IllegallySmolCats,femzjnm,t3_epzdrg,1579273582.0,This smol criminal is planning to become immortal! His cuteness is gonna be immortal as well. Lord save us!

IllegallySmolCats,fekozrz,t3_epl7ld,1579204612.0,Cant believe the cajones on this one! Look at how she is flaunting her loot. I hope her punishment fit the crime (lifetime of cuddles and toys)
IllegallySmolCats,feko1ji,t3_epmt8o,1579204051.0,"uff, I hope anyone near this smol criminal has sufficient protection until the smolice arrive, her smolness is killer!"
relationship_advice,feifhtl,t3_epajp9,1579137309.0,"You are a good pet parent. Pets aren't disposable, they are your family. Anyone who pushes you to abandon your family is not worth it."
IllegallySmolCats,fehca39,t3_ep2swi,1579113603.0,"I feel so safe knowing that this smol criminal has been captured and we likely be given a life sentence of cuddles, kisses and hugs. Amen!"
relationship_advice,feajxrf,t3_eo85t8,1578949716.0,This is so unbelievable that I think you are making this up. You make yourself sound like a giant doormat. Your wife is making whoopie with your boss and a clown out of you. My condolences in advance for the sh*t storm that is about to come.

Pets,fdtdyie,t3_emzguf,1578715391.0,I feel your anguish and wish I could do something to help. Will you consider a second opinion from a different vet?

AmItheAsshole,fdnotsl,t3_ema2lf,1578590119.0,"Fuck! Massive YTA. We have 3 cats and pay $1500 for just the insurance because we are the pet parents, so it completely falls upon us to make sure that all members of our family(human or not) are protected. I hope that your gf dumps you as you have 0 empathy."

cats,fdiiy2m,t1_fdihvla,1578443955.0,"Wow, that's a whole lot of dedication. Kudos to you guys. 

Do cats need stimulation, yes, but all of it can be provided indoors and with supervised outings. I have even seen people use exercise wheels with high energy cats. I'd never rely on the goodwill of strangers when it comes to our cats."
cats,fdi2kr5,t1_fdhqajq,1578434606.0,That's not really true. I follow someone on FB and IG who owns a Bengal and walks him on a leash. Sure it takes more effort but that comes with being a responsible owner.
IllegallySmolCats,fdfkx4d,t3_ekyw8y,1578364092.0,Why such lax security around soft and smol criminals? Smh.

ps: He is the second Nacho I saw on Reddit today, not even counting my own crazy girl. Today is a Nacho kinda day!"
teefies,fck8yp6,t1_fck7v5z,1577719814.0,"Firstly, apologies, I assumed he was a girl because our Nacho is a girl(Nacho Tacocat). 

Secondly, who in their right mind would return such a cutie pie back? Their loss is your gain. :)"

AmItheAsshole,fbdggbb,t3_eco8uh,1576761387.0,"YTA, retaliating against your cat? I mean are you happy that you scared him? Sounds so mean. And if you didn't realize , cats feel most vulnerable while using the box and you basically attacked him in his safe spot. Take a step back and reflect on your silly action. Kudos to the gf though for being a responsible pet parent."
