TheExpanse,ffiopub,t1_ffi40fc,1579978942.0,"It took that long because Earth has defenses against it. That was part of the point of the scene in season 4 where they test those defenses to get a better idea of their capabilities.

It's kind of like when they use the rail guns to take out the planet buster nukes that Mars has. Mars built then but doesn't use them because Earth has degrees to intercept the missiles, and once the stations reveal themselves they would be shot down by the rail guns so they would only get one or two salvos off.

Earth hadn't used the rail guns because of the difficulty of detecting the exact positions of the missile platforms. If they had inaccurate intelligence on how many there were, or missed one because they thought it was in a different location, then the missiles would be launched. This is in fact what happens when they're slow to shoot one postform, it launches, and most of its payload is destroyed, but one gets trough the defenses.

Rock dropping has the same problems in general though. Sure, you could throw one, but it's probably going to be detected and destroyed. Since Earth is probably tracking every rock in the system over a certain size (something we're trying to do with current tech, and that they would be even better at) then chances are they could trace who pushed it. It's probably not going to be Mars because they have their planet busters and they're more effective, so it's a matter of figuring out which Belter colony it was. At that point, you just decide if you're going to vaporize the asteroid or land troops. It's a losing strategy unless you find a way to tip the balance."

RedLetterMedia,ff8azcp,t3_es5adl,1579671379.0,"This is a great post that, even if I disagree with some of the more personal objections, is well reasoned and gets at a lot of the things I both liked and disliked about DS9. The one thing I kept wondering though was: Have you seen Babylon 5?

Babylon 5 is a great show from around the same era that tackles many of the issues at play in DS9 (the creator, J Michael Strzynski, even pitched it to Paramount and felt that they stole some of his ideas to create DS9) but handles a lot of things differently. For one, it's leans heavier towards being serialized, including having like 80% of the episodes being written by JMS himself. Secondly, and no spoilers, but what seems like it's the main conflict gets wrapped up part way through season 4 because JMS specifically wanted some time to explore what happens AFTER the war is over.

Basically though, if you like DS9 and BSG, I would say to check out Babylon 5. The three shows share a lot of DNA whole also being different and offering differing perspectives on some of the same issues. It's also streaming on Amazon Prime right now."

There are many things in the world that fall quite slowly and thus reach terminal velocity almost instantly. This is because of air resistance having a much larger impact than gravity due to either how light they are or how big their surface area is.

All his math is saying is that a carrot is relatively light with a relatively high surface area to volume ratio. Our terminal velocity is much higher because we're FAR heavier than a carrot, and we can't increase our surface area that much. However, even for a skydiver, they can change their speed by nearly a factor of 3 depending on body position alone."

changemyview,fe53rzb,t1_fe4u1la,1578865420.0,">Many factors go into it: economy, alcohol/tobacco usage rates, opioid use, education, nutrition, etc.

Of the factors you listed everything except for the general economy can be addressed by healthcare to an extent. 

Nutrition is the easiest if these to combat through healthcare because you would have access to nutritionists that could help a person/family build a better diet and keep weight under control (which has a lot of knock on problems). Not saying everyone has to be a supermodel or Mr Universe, but we would probably see issues like Diabetes decrease, which can drastically affect life expectancy.

Alcohol, tobacco, and opioid use all fall under the purview of addiction treatment programs of one sort out another. More affordable healthcare would allow people to seek out help more readily. It won't eliminate those issues, but it will reduce them, and by consequence will you'll increase life expectancy.

Even education, since kids in more rural or poor areas without access to healthcare often miss more school and don't perform as well as their peers, can have an effect on life expectancy. Poor access to healthcare can affect education, which has impacts on job and employment status, which has a lot of further knock on effects such whether or not you can afford to eat healthy.

Yes, none of these are necessarily casual relationships, but that's always a bit overblown. Share attacks are now frequent on days when ice cream sales are higher is a famous example of a correlation that doesn't real causation (the cause is that it's hot, so more people but ice cream and go to the beach, which increases risk of an attack). But what about the fact that the yield curve inverted before every recession since 1955? Is that a casual relationship, or correlation? Many things, even if closely linked and directly predictive of each other are still declared a correlation because it's almost always impossible to separate out ALL the factors, yet we still move forward dealing with those correlations.

In this case, expanded access to healthcare improves either directly or is correlated with improvement in all but one of the factors you listed. When you look at countries like Canada they also tend to lead us in several of these factors as well, likely due in least in part to their healthcare access."

Honestly, a lot of this was the fault of Don Mattrick and calling it the Xbox One, which card confusion with the OG Xbox and gets you back into a numbering scheme. Xbox 360 was such a departure that it's more like Nintendo with the Wii, 3DS, Switch, etc, and the name being unique. One implies a Two, but then your back with Xbox Two vs PS5.

The One X is analogous to the PS4 Pro and mostly for enthusiasts, so it's not a big deal. The One S is just part of the established ""Slim"" console refreshes that we've been seeing for a couple generations now. Neither of these matter to the general consumer too much because they're asking for an Xbox One and they'll buy whatever is newest, or be in a store and a salesperson can explain ""Well the X is like an upgraded One"" or whatever. Either way though, they're late generation products that usually never sell as well as the primary console at initial release (I say usually, but there are exceptions I'm sure).

Series X, while a bit confusing at first glance seems to be an attempt to just fundamental change the baking scheme and get out of the game entirely. They might be trying to move towards something like what chip manufacturers do where you got a Pentium vs a Celeron. It might be a Pentium 2 or a Pentium 3, but Celeron is a different generation of chip. So we might be get a Series X2 as the refresh, but the next gen will be the Series Y, or Series Q, or whatever.

Plus, the One X is quite well known as sort of the high point in performance for consoles (at least on the terraflops race) this generation, and the specs suggest that the Series X will have more terraflops than the PS5, so they might be purposely using the X to ride off the marketing and goodwill the One X has already earned.

There's an experimental effect that will lower heat (thermal spread maybe?) as well as a couple of engineering paths (clean drives are a big one, as opposed to the Dirt Drag drives you put on combat ships, typically)."

It's hard enough keeping ONE relationship on track while maintaining my own work, hobbies, and social life, I can't imagine doing that with multiple partners."

TheExpanse,fchv321,t1_fch65bl,1577654494.0,"Miller in the show is a bit more human than The Investigator in the books. The Investigator WAS wanting to find out what happened, and finding the bullet satisfies that. In the show, The Investigator still wants to find that, and kind of does, but the *real* Miller wants a release as well. So he kind of accomplished both by interacting with the bullet, as well as finally laying himself, Julie, and all of Eros to rest."

TheExpanse,fchif70,t1_fcgqsv5,1577650729.0,"It's not in the main books, but I think a lot of it may have come from Gods of Risk, which was her novella. I haven't read it personally though, so I'm not sure how much they pulled and how much was new for the show. Either way though, like you said, it was a good look at Mars and how they're dealing with the way everything is changing."

One of the nice things though is that since it was a third party production company basically nothing changed about the short because all the same people are working on it."
