Advice,ffdbke5,t3_et02xj,1579817362.0,"Get your GED and go to college. The GED won't matter if you have a degree.
Or you could go to night school for your diploma. Look into it at your local high school.

Good luck!"

Should I go to the grocery store and hang out in the baking aisle for a man to try and pick me up?? Should I wear my June Cleaver apron??"
cats,ff3bo55,t3_ere8ga,1579538005.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. My mother's house burned years ago and her dogs were home alone. Thankfully my mother and stepfather were not home. They were devastated at the loss of their dogs and their home. Glad to hear that you're ok.
relationship_advice,ff2367g,t3_er7km3,1579492542.0,You're both 16 years old. If you're not ready then don't have sex. Sounds like he is ok with it and will still care about you if you don't.

Advice,fdwny6z,t3_en9bnw,1578760677.0,Be honest with him don't string him along. And don't tell him you just want to be friends cuz that gives them hope. You can tell him that you want to be friends and nothing more. And let him direct how that's going to work not you. Don't reach out to him to make sure he's okay anything like that. Good luck! It's never easy to break up with someone regardless of why or how. Just be an adult about it don't be mean.

CasualConversation,fcuvgnd,t3_eiz4ce,1577989367.0,"Good for you for making the choice to quit! I was a 30 year smoker and have been free of cigarettes for almost 12 years now. The best advice I can give is to keep trying to quit. One day it will click. You might go days or weeks or even months without smoking but that 1 thing might make you start again.. just keep quitting. There is an app called Easy Quit that tells you how many cigarettes you've not smoked and how much money you save by not smoking. Give it a look.

I knew I was free when my mom passed away and I didn't pick up a cigarette to cope. My family was worried that I would start but Mom having passed due to the long slow deterioration of her body and mind from a stroke directly related to her smoking.. nope I was not going to start again. 

Good luck to you and be gentle on yourself if you do slip, just keep trying to quit! This is the hardest thing that you'll do and the absolute best thing that you can do for your health!"

homeowners,fcim6mh,t3_ehbex0,1577664894.0,"Congratulations on your new home!
Before I moved into my house after closing, I had someone paint all of my ceilings and the insides of all of the closets. If you can afford to do the painting and new floors before you move in, do it. All of these are much easier than after you bring all of your stuff in.

edit: added congratulations"

relationship_advice,fbuu2w5,t3_eej8ho,1577120373.0,"I'm so very sorry for your loss. Please take the time that you need to grieve and tell your gf to leave you alone. This is not about her at all and she is making it to be. You deserve better than that. Keeping you in my thoughts.

I was in hs and my boyfriend's father passed away suddenly. I just sat with him and listened and held him while he grieved whenever he needed. I felt so bad that there was nothing that I could do for him but never let him know that. He wrote me a letter afterward that he was so glad that I was there for him and that he loved me for being there for him when he needed me most. I kept that letter in my wallet for over 20 years, long after we broke up."
