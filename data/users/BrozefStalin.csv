australia,fcjbfka,t1_fcj3ktw,1577682109.0,"It sounds like you don't really understand how medical bills work. 

Firstly, the doctor decides what they are going to charge for the colonoscopy. The Medicare Schedule Fee for item 32090 was ~$340. If your doctor was charging $620, then that's because they want the patient to have an out of pocket. The doc could charge $340 if they wanted to make the patient happy. Or they could charge $10k if they really wanted to. That's up to them. 

Not sure why you've brought up excess, because it has nothing to do with medical bills. It applies to the hospital theatre use and accommodation/nurses bill. So the PHI will pay the entire hospital bill of ~$10k, except the $500 excess (that the patient decided they wanted on their policy by the way). 

I'm not sure where you've got these $28 and $120 figures from. I don't believe in health insurance either and don't subscribe to it myself, but I work in medical billing and know how the system works and what rough costs are, and yours are way off."

The exact same thing will happen here, mark my words. And again, people will vote for it in droves.
