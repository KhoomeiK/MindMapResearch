depression,fdxqvny,t3_en7336,1578771994.0,Maybe that's because  that's because one part of you want to be happy but on the other hand you could just lost hope for feeling better and you just gave up and judging from my and other people expieriences it's really common and easy for people with depression

depression,fc6dk73,t3_eg1ib1,1577478043.0,My girlfriend gets really obsessed when I'm sad and she gets mad at me because she says that I have no reason to be sad and maybe that's true maybe I'm just a crybaby and I feel low for no reason
depression,fc5cexa,t3_eg9dzt,1577453186.0,I love someone and she loves me but I still can't understand why she loves me and also I can't stop hating myself because I feel like I just can't do anything right and I'm not good in anything that I do and I just don't matter I have and nothing motivates me to do anything because I know I will be shut at it and now sleep is my favourite activity because then I can forget about everything and literally not live without having anyone worried or sad
