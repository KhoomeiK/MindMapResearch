CompetitiveHS,ffg3q4e,t1_fffwc1y,1579897797.0,Could I see your decklist?
CompetitiveHS,ffg3lnz,t1_fffy44t,1579897721.0,"Against Druid, flik most of the time I would say."
CompetitiveHS,fe5lpnw,t1_fe5au61,1578871004.0,Hah this happened to me today! I could have been your opponent.. around rank 2 and 3 EU atm..
Meditation,fe18sgx,t1_fe0pjx8,1578823857.0,"Do you use a bolster cushion? I have some lower back issues. Since ensuring my hips are above my knees when I sit, I have little to no pain at all. It keeps the spine upright and centred."
CompetitiveHS,fdxqrev,t1_fdxi65n,1578771944.0,What list are you running?
bipolar,fdsbzfc,t3_emsa0z,1578699118.0,I am laughing so hard at this right now. This is my life.
bipolar,fdsbgiq,t3_emtml5,1578698765.0,This moved me. Thank you.
CompetitiveHS,fds6n23,t1_fdrxd0b,1578695543.0,I’ve been playing gala rogue with the death rattle package and it’s been working fine. From 4-3. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised when you sub the DR package back in
hearthstone,fd66kc1,t1_fd651lg,1578186251.0,I haven’t minded pirate warrior either. Or DR rogue. Gala shaman and priest have been a little annoying occasionally but not badly enough for me to think we need more nerfs just yet.
hearthstone,fd664vr,t3_ek5ds7,1578186057.0,"Never thought I’d be saying this but I personally don’t really feel that nerfs are necessary right now. There are definitely some super strong decks, but there’s a lot of varied stuff being played. That’s my experience so far at rank 5 anyway."
bipolar,fcntlo4,t3_ei6671,1577818163.0,Awesome! Keep it up.
bipolar2,fc0xtu7,t1_fc0wsow,1577302593.0,Yeah I get that. My impression from your post was that he later found out that he had been misdiagnosed as Bipolar II. There is no way cutting out sugar cures this disorder.
