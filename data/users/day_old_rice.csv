cats,ffrw8b5,t1_ffrfek4,1580167268.0,"He may be part Maine Coon, but from the rest of his appearance I'm assuming he would be a very small percentage of Maine Coon. I don't think he has enough in him to make him grow to the size of one, he may just be a slightly above average sized cat. My tabby is on the larger side at about 14 lbs. People think he may be part bengal cause of his spots but honestly all Tabbies have those spots so I doubt he has any if at all in him. He also has the tufts on his ears. The most descriptive you could be is probably just a Domestic Short Hair."

He usually says something along the lines of ""that's so cool!"" or other supportive phrases cause he knows I have worked my ass off to get this job and my education.

relationship_advice,ff9jn63,t3_escy5v,1579714417.0,"This happened to me in my previous relationship. My partner at the time put no effort into how he looked. He would go months without getting a haircut and when he did cut his hair, he just buzzed it all off which didn't really suit him. He always wore the same 2 pairs of worn out jeans, canvas shoes that he has had for years with holes all over them and severely discolored, and wouldn't leave the house in anything but a zip up hoodie and a baseball cap. He wore that outfit to our anniversary dinner at a really fancy place, he wore that to my graduation ceremony where all the guests were well dressed. He repeatedly ignored my requests to wear something nicer to occasions that mattered to me and it really wore me down. We aren't shallow people for wanting our partners to put in some effort for us once in a while, especially when it really matters. If this has been an area of trouble between you two for quite some time and discussions have proven useless, I would suggest it's time to find someone else who matches your level of effort."

However, I can see where he is coming from. Personally, I hate souvenirs. It's always stuff I have no use for and means little to nothing to me since I have never been to that place. I chuck all souvenirs given to me into a hidden box where they will sit until I move house again and throw them out. My best friend always brings me back things, which I have always happily accepted because that's what you do when you get a gift from someone you love. But I later mentioned to her that while I appreciate to no end that she thinks of me and buys these gifts for me, I don't really have the space or need for them and would rather she brought me back a snack or treat from that place instead.

cats,feh7svu,t1_feh4grc,1579110928.0,"> And finally, one of the best things you can get for a new cat. Another cat. Cats are better off if they have a companion to hang around with. They get bored and lonely. 

Totally true if you are adopting a kitten/young cat (under 1.5 years typically). Kittens and adolescents need another cat to play with as it teaches them how to play ""nicely."" Also, since they will play with each other a lot, this will take some of the responsibility of playing with them yourself off of you. Plus, playing cats are really entertaining to watch, its like a WWE match all the time. Note: Most shelters WILL NOT let you adopt a single cat younger than 6 months. Every shelter I have been to has a strict rule of you must adopt 2 kittens if you are looking for one under  6 months and you do not already have a cat at home, so keep that in mind for deciding how young of a cat you want.

I wouldn't say every cat needs a friend though, especially if you are adopting an older cat. I have a few friends with just one cat and they seem perfectly content. Older cats are generally harder to socialize and sometimes won't care for a friend. If you adopt an older cat (which I highly recommend if this is your first cat or if you have a somewhat busy schedule) I would see how they do alone first. The sure signs that your cat does in fact need a friend is (abnormal) destruction. I lived with roommates who also had cats, but then I moved into an apartment with just myself and my cat. After a month I could tell she was lonely because I came home to items chewed up that she would never touch before and all of the ramen packages I had ripped into and strewn around the house. Got her a little brother and have had no problems since (aside from normal cat problems)."
AmItheAsshole,feeh0k8,t1_feeffzp,1579033577.0,My cat wears a harness at all times outside! It doesnt look like it in the picture because his fur is covering it but he has a straps and buckles one as he slips out of mesh harnesses to easily.
AmItheAsshole,fee23c7,t1_fedzgzf,1579024793.0,"Thank you! He is one of the friendliest cats I have ever met. I dont think you will have a problem with him slipping. Just be sure its very tight and never let them pull backwards (facing you trying to back up) on the harness. Thats the easiest way to get it off. Exposure therapy is great though and you really have to be committed. Even just sitting outside everyday for 10 minutes is great! Reward him for not running away when a car passes by, or for not reacting when he sees a dog. For the most part my cat sees dogs as good things cause he gets treats haha"

cats,fedwb05,t1_feduad9,1579021247.0,He is wearing a harness! Its just strappy instead of mesh as i found he can easily slip out of mesh harnesses so in the pic his fur covers the straps. He is fully secure i promise!

AmItheAsshole,feca3ox,t1_fec8vv9,1578969378.0,It is incredibly unsafe to let him out without a leash. While he follows me I am not confident that he will always follow me. This park is in the middle of a major city and he could be run over if he gets to the roads as he freezes when he sees cars. There are coyotes in our neighborhood and park and if he got away from me he would be killed before the morning. He doesn't mind the leash and he enjoys the walks as is. It is the safest way to give him the exercise he needs and that can be confirmed by any veterinary specialist. I appreciate your concern for my cat but I assure you this is what is best for him and that is not up for debate.
AmItheAsshole,fec2s7g,t1_fec25ck,1578965826.0,I understand he is a privilege and not an accessory. He has an excessive amount of energy that cannot be expensed in our apartment. I am not walking him because I think it is cute but because it was highly recommended that we do it by our vet and a cat behaviorist. It's best for his health. Cats like to roam and this is the safest way to do so. I got a cat because I didn't want to have to take a dog on a walk daily but here we are.

Everytime he would walk a good 20 steps he got a treat or when he came when called he would get a treat. Now we don't need to bring treats and he just loves the walks!

I want to stay in and just recharge. That doesn't mean I don't want to see anyone though. My partner was really understanding of this before we lived together so he would always make ""inside plans."" Such as make breakfast or dinner together, he would have a bunch of movies lined up to watch for the day, play games or go on a walk. They're my favorite days quite honestly. But if you are they type of person that really wants to go out, you should definitely schedule that with her ahead of time. Maybe even a couple of weeks in advance. Personally, that helps me mentally prepare for going out and to essentially budget my energy leading up to it.

This, unfortunately, could also just be a sign that you two are not compatible with each other. While I love staying in, I will every couple months to get an itch to go out.

relationship_advice,fdr3qym,t3_emtvif,1578679117.0,"You guys need to have a more in depth discussion about this. Not wanting to get married yet does not mean he never wants to get married. He may just have reservations about marrying you right now as you are still so young. I was in your position, got very serious with a guy when I was 19 who was a bit older than me and despite being very mature for my age he said he didn't want to marry me while I am so young. At the time, I didn't get it. We were ""basically like a married couple"" so why not just do it? I don't need to be all wild and crazy like other kids my age. Turns out, I did need that time in my life. I started resenting him because we were in different stages of our lives. He never wanted to go out or try things with me since he had already been there done that. It turned me into this hermit and I was going insane so I ended it. I went through my wild phase and now with my current partner I have no regrets. This may not be the case for you, but I highly recommend waiting it out.

Also, I realized that I wasn't wanting to get married, what I actually wanted was just the wedding. A big party with all the people I love that was all about me and my partner. Like you said, being married doesn't change much so I wasn't looking forward to that as much as I was looking forward to planning the whole ordeal. This made me see that I can wait for a while on getting married.

Plus, nothing is more stressful to an elder cat than changing its whole environment and owner. I've seen pure hatred between cats turn into tolerance so you have to at least try. Watch videos, talk to a specialist. Since your cat is the problem, I would say if anyone HAS to get rid of their animal it would be yours. But I am a strong believer in rehoming/surrendering being the absolute last resort. So figure it out"

I am a 22F and when I need advice on something heavy from my mom, we will often settle in on the couch with me on her lap and we will talk about it.

I met my partner of 2 years on Tinder so I guess I could say that it is perfectly healthy as it is just another dating app. But if you don't want to deal with filtering through people who are there just for hookups then it probably isn't for you nor is it healthy.

This is the proper response to your unnecessary anger and YTA. My family did this to me too, and when I found out I was upset. For like a day. Because after that I realized that nothing in my life would be different after having learned that. This doesn't affect you in any way. If something (god forbid) were to happen to either one of your parents you would still be a beneficiary of any policy. And your father is right, if you are in a state that recognizes Common Law marriage, which you probably are, then they are legally married. They have all the benefits of being married.

This has nothing to do with you. They really are not lying to other people and other people are not making glowing statements about a false relationship. You insisting they get married is rude and disrespectful as if the life they have given you is suddenly of lesser value than one if they were married. No one else if making a big deal out of this because it is not one."

sex,fdemilh,t3_ekxrj5,1578342159.0,"You will feel it a bit less over time as the strings essentially soften from the body heat. Before you two get going, either you or her just stick your fingers up there and move the strings so that they wrap around the cervix instead of hanging down. 9/10 times solves the problem. Unless it is causing you actual pain, don't encourage her to get them cut shorter because that can lead to problems when it comes time for removal. If you are feeling the IUD itself, she should get that checked out as it may not be inserted all the way or the cervix is rejecting it"

Now, my other cat, will scream as soon as I open the door. Doesn't matter if she is coming with me or not she does not like outside. I leash trained them both the exact same way. She is comfortable in the harness and will run around the house with it on no problem but when we get outside she is running for the nearest bush. She is extremely food motivated but that all vanishes outside. I've tried chicken, her favorite treats, her favorite toy. It's been a year and a half and I don't think there's any hope for her. 10/10 still a good girl but only inside the house."

sex,fcy7fwr,t3_ejiwu2,1578075890.0,"I have had 2 IUD's, got my first one when I was 18. No pregnancy scares, complications, weight gain/loss, or crazy mood swings. I noticed that I stopped getting as wet as I used to when I didn't have it though and that's about it. The odds of pregnancy are so very small. It may seem like a lot of people can get pregnant on them but that is because the only ones leaving reviews or comments on them are the very small percentage that do get pregnant.

My first one was Skyla. It lasted for 3 years and I still got periods on it which I personally preferred as it gave me a sense of security to make sure I was in fact not pregnant. Its on the smaller side of IUD's and compared to my friends who got a bigger one like the Mirena, I had a pretty good recovery. Spotted for about 2 weeks and cramped for a couple days after insertion.

After the first expired, I got the Kyleena, which is essentially the same as Skyla in every way except it lasts for 5 years. I like it just the same as Skyla. 

If she ends up getting an IUD, you may be able to feel the strings when having sex, which is annoying at most. But unless it is causing you actual pain, do not encourage her to get the strings cut shorter. Shorter strings may cause complications upon removal and if anything you will feel them even more. After a week, the strings should be pretty soft and you yourself can actually just stick your fingers up there and move the strings so that they wrap around her cervix rather than them just hanging down. Best solution to the problem in my opinion.

Don't forget to explore other forms of birth control as well. If she wants a set it and forget it type then look into the shot or the arm implant. Not as common but they can be just as effective if the IUD doesn't end up working out. 

You are in college. DO NOT GET A VASECTOMY AND SHE SHOULD NOT GET HER TUBES TIED. You both are way too young to even be considering either one of those choices. Wait a few more years and then make that decision. Vasectomies cannot always be reversed and the tying of tubes is a huge procedure."
cats,fcxxkuz,t1_fcxwk3e,1578071900.0,"Ohh well my cat is super food motivated haha. I would take a treat and touch it to his nose then lift it up which would make him stand up to try and get it. When he did that I would give him the treat. I would do the same thing with spinning, just have him follow the treat in a circle. After a week or two I didn't need to give him treats anymore he would just follow my hand as if there was a treat there and then I'd just give him a pet when he did it which seems to be an equal reward for him. I have no idea how you would do this if your cat doesn't care for food. Maybe just try to find that one food your cat goes crazy for and only use it when training? I give my cats pieces of cooked chicken as their ""you did a good job"" treat."
