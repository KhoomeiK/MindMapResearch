brighteyes,ff4o329,t3_ermw67,1579568319.0,The 6th line is the label- dead oceans- and the 7th appears to be venues based on what everyone else is saying but the other lines don’t mean anything and are ripped off of real eye charts.
unpopularopinion,ff35avs,t1_ff2xdsi,1579534024.0,I will check it out! Thanks!
unpopularopinion,ff1bs7v,t3_epj02u,1579477249.0,Give me links or details on how to get into these things without school or experience and I’ll get back to you in 5 years to see if it works.
AskReddit,ff0izat,t1_ff01wzp,1579469317.0,"I’m the same way. I’ve been with my bf for almost 3 years and I still think that he doesn’t like me and that he doesn’t find me attractive. It’s probably just anxiety and insecurity. Unfortunately I don’t have any tips to make that go away, I’ve heard people say finding things in yourself that you love will help you accept other people’s love, but that’s kind of hard to do for a lot of people."
AskReddit,ff00jok,t3_eqx5ol,1579463879.0,"It just depends then on how much you trust him. Do you trust him not to lie to you? If it’s just because of self-doubt then I totally understand that’s me 100%, but when you want to be in a relationship with somebody you have to sometimes trust them and what they say is true more than you trust the insecure side of your brain. Not saying you should just have sex whenever he wants even if you don’t want sex- definitely don’t do that- but trust him if he is worthy of your trust."
AskReddit,fez4x85,t3_eqx5ol,1579453898.0,"How long have you been dating? There’s a “honeymoon period” whenever I’ve had a new boyfriend where we fuck like rabbits all the time at any given chance, but as we get more comfortable with each other and get over the “omg we could just have sex!” Giddyness of a new relationship you move on to just hanging out and having sex less often- which some people see as the death of a relationship but is actually the start of an adult relationship. If you guys have been fooling around for less than a year- don’t worry about it. If it’s getting to the point where you don’t want to have sex because it’s boring since it’s all you do then just say that. Tell him ahead of time “hey I’m not feeling horny can we watch a movie or something when you come over?” Or surprise him with dinner or something. If he asks just come out and say “it feels like it’s all we do and It’s kinda making me feel like it’s all you want me for” be honest but also be chill- it’s normal at the beginning of a relationship."

It’s the whole reason the lgbtq+ community is so big it’s why more women are getting diagnosed with endometriosis etc. nature’s doing it."

tipofmytongue,fepbixo,t3_eq0wgi,1579316496.0,Reminds me of Gris Grimly’s books. Could it be one from his Wicked Nursery Rhymes collection?
amiugly,feim1rl,t3_eohb17,1579141693.0,Your eyes look sad.
amiugly,feil0d8,t3_ep4vaj,1579140986.0,"I think you’re sweet looking. A bit harry-potter-esque but you’ve got nice eyes, a nice nose, and nice cheeks. Maybe put on a bit of muscle if you can but to be honest you look nice and sweet and stable and those are all things I find attractive."
amiugly,feik46k,t3_ep3u19,1579140381.0,Even if you are self conscious about your smile you still look way more approachable when you are smiling. If I saw the not smiling version of you somewhere I would not approach you and be honestly a little afraid. I would definitely be afraid if you approached me. But the smiling you makes me think that you’re a sweet guy who enjoys a cup of tea and good comedy. (You look a bit British- if you’re not then maybe lean into it and move to the UK for a year and pick up an accent. Accents improve attractiveness 100X)
depression,feij1cn,t3_ep4bw6,1579139662.0,This is me 100% my life feels all surreal and wrong like it’s not mine and I don’t deserve it because I shouldn’t even be here
JennaJulien,fdhy29m,t3_elhky5,1578432242.0,I’ve definitely seen that episode before- it exists.
