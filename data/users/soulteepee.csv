He was only impeached by the House, not the Senate.  

Trump has been impeached by the House.  Right now he is in the exact same position as Clinton.

Pelosi said 'impeached for life' because Trump was trying to make it seem that if the Senate didn't impeach, he wasn't impeached at all.

Trump has not yet had a trial.  He has, however, been impeached: [The impeached official remains in office until a trial is held. That trial, and removal from office if convicted, is separate from the act of impeachment itself. In impeachment proceedings, the defendant does not risk forfeiture of life, liberty, or property.'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States)"
