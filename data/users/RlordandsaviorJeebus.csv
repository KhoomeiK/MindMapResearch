NoMansSkyTheGame,fffy3ls,t3_etcg9j,1579894327.0,Love your ship design. It reminds me of an assault gunship from the old Star Wars flight simulator games.
exmormon,fffn1tq,t3_etbspg,1579887488.0,"Sex on the beach was literally my first alcoholic beverage haha my tip for you. If you find the alcohol taste to be too strong just add more of the juice to cut it out. Also since you've never been drunk before I would recommend drinking a couple of the mixed drinks, and then drinking some water throughout. Just pay attention to how you feel, you can go from being really drunk and giggly, to overly drunk with the room spinning and your head in a toilet. Water will help prevent this, same with a hangover the next day if you were to drink too much. 

Oh and make sure you've eaten and drank enough through out the day. This will also help to prevent a hangover and the spins. If you ever feel too drunk, if you can manage to eat any greasy, fatty, carb loaded foods you can kind of soak up the alcohol and it can potentially make you feel less drunk. Most of all. Enjoy!! Its an experience and can be part of a normal healthy lifestyle! Love grabbing a beer with friends every now and then."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fezwnqj,t3_eqsv3c,1579462631.0,"Got burned by this game when it came out. I followed it for years waiting for it. It's entirely different than when it first came out. I can see where the enjoyment comes from. But to me it's boring as hell. The exploration is the main focus. And while it absolutely has gotten 10 times better. It still is so boring. Unless you're a person who constantly likes to role play or make up your own stories while playing. Walking around different colored planets that all look vaguely the same gets boring. Theres very little to find on planets. At all. It's just walking around looking for resources that now seem to be on all planets. To be fair. If you play with someone else this can be a great game. Same if you like to base build. But to me this is just space minecraft, that's a million times more tedious, with shit user interfaces, and a lack of a satisfying gameplay loop. You just mine to get more stuff to be able to mine faster. Cool. The main thing I was excited for when it came out was space combat because they teased that. If that's anything you care about go elsewhere. If you want a relaxing game to just chill out with then yeah I'd recommend it."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fe08c3k,t3_endx3j,1578805810.0,You should get enjoyment out of the single player and offline modes. As others have said you can customize matches and what not. To me they are meh. I mainly play the online. But I enjoyed and loved the old battlefronts. You should at the least check out the online space battles since you semi liked the old space battles. There are players of course but theres bots as well and objectives to go for. It's at least worth a look. If it's on sale for $20 or less I'd say it would be worth it.
Whatcouldgowrong,fdtn74o,t1_fdtgo2a,1578719204.0,"Pneumothoraxes arent usually a killer, they can resolve themselves if theyre small enough. Tall, thin, men are prone to spontaneously occurring pneomothoraxes. Same with smokers. Always a bad thing though! In this case if he developed one from the blast I'd assume it would have the potential to be large enough to cause a tension pneumothorax which is life threatening within a matter of minutes. A tensions pneumothorax is basically a pneumothorax that is big enough to trap enough air in then chest to shift over the heart and lungs eventually causing the heart to stop because it cant beat against the pressure anymore.

 The other thing I thought I noticed was wheezing in his breathing at the end. That could be a dangerous sign. I wish we could have seen his face. If there were any singe or burn marks around his mouth, it could've meant he inhaled enough hot air to also have an inhalation injury. Which would cause his bronchioles to become inflamed restricting his breathing even more. I hope that dude was smart enough to at least be checked out."
gifs,fdotimd,t1_fdossis,1578612527.0,It's literally one of the dumbest least thought out rules. Like I get the thinking behind it. It has to do with looking professional. But also. Do you really expect dudes to take time off work to grow a beard?  Is someone with a patchy or not entirely filled out beard really bringing down the image of firefighters everywhere? Because that's how they treat it.
gifs,fdorf8m,t1_fdonnmn,1578611213.0,"My roommate here in the US is a firefighter in a large urban city and everyone is allowed to have beards. The only rules about beards are that they must be well cared for and be full thickness. You cannot grow a beard while on shift or be in the process. So you either have it constantly shaved because rules, or you grow a full beard or mustache or whatever style while on vacation or time off. Then when you come back with said facial hair already established no one cares."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdl5j7i,t1_fdl57r2,1578517407.0,I've seen Everspace. But I dont know much about it. The only other space sim I currently dabble in is Elite  Dangerous. My only issue is I'm limited in my capacity for what games I can play on PC.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdl5aqk,t1_fdl3lcv,1578517287.0,Apparently it's called Descent: Underground. And I guess they're having issues getting the game published. You can look at the concept art on GOG's website.
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdl4vtd,t1_fdl3lcv,1578517084.0,"Well awesome! I know what I'm probably getting later today. Thanks so much! Yeah I just searched for what I was talking about. Apparantly there was a company trying to release Descent, as a reboot in 2019. But from what I can tell the project was canceled and I think the studio closed."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdl2b24,t1_fdl1i2c,1578515842.0,I've never heard of Overload! How long has it been out? I thought they were coming out with a brand new Descent on like PS4? Are these not related?
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdkrqef,t3_elrf71,1578509775.0,"Civilization 3. My personal favorite of them all. Your computer should be able to run it. My POS laptop I think had worse specs than yours and could do it fine. Here's some of my other favorite classic PC games that I used to play and should definitely work:

Army Men World at War
Star Wars  X Wing Alliance
Star Wars Tie Fighter 
Descent 1&2
1602 AD
Age of Empires Definitive Edition (this is a remake but it has the classic mode in it and your PC could run that no issue)"
funny,fdhzxq5,t1_fdhqcqq,1578433236.0,"This is why its important for people who work in high stress jobs, (police, fire, ems, military, etc) to be trained in stressful situations. Otherwise if you havent learned how to think during high stress your brain does stuff like this and people can die. I always just find it so interesting that our brains literally will shut down like this under extreme stress, unless we force them to go through the experience over and over first."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdgjhzg,t3_el5zg8,1578399320.0,Path of Exile. Literally the biggest upgrade skill tree I have ever seen. It's like Diablo in terms of gameplay sort of. But from what I've heard and can understand for myself is that it seems more approachable and better than Diable in some ways. If you like games like that. Then this is probably a must. It's entirely free to play
insanepeoplefacebook,fdfh642,t1_fded0zw,1578361592.0,"Shh, it's because atheists like me are hiding in their midst and god has to punish us."
todayilearned,fct02ik,t1_fcsx1mo,1577929403.0,"If I am remembering correctly it gets broken down into formaldehyde by the liver. Which is extremely toxic. You're liver will, in essence, ignore the methanol for ethanol allowing for your kidneys to excrete it out as methanol before its processed in the liver."
todayilearned,fcsw8jh,t3_eimla3,1577926693.0,Fun fact. If you drink methanol or any other type of alcohol besides the standard. They use IV ethanol as a treatment since your liver naturally wants to break down ethanol over methanol or any other type of alcohol you could ingest.
TooAfraidToAsk,fco0hos,t1_fcnzl69,1577821875.0,"You have no idea. If you're not from here now I get the disbelief and disgust at my post. To be honest I did not know whether this was a uniquely American thing. Seems to me it is. I wish I were exaggerating even a little bit. 

So does this not happen in the U.K at all? Like theres not an entire culture behind nudes? Because there absolutely is here."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcnygoh,t1_fcnxt9c,1577820881.0,Are you in your 20's or younger? Because if not the dick pic thing might seem weird. And I understand why it would seem to be bullshit. But It's not an exaggeration. I wish it was. But it isnt. Idk about everywhere in the world or even the U.S. I grew up in a college town here so that could have influence on my experience but I am not exaggerating. After graduating high school and working for a para for a year at an elementary school we had to sit down the entire 5th grade and have a talk about nudes and sexting. It's a generational thing. It's only gotten bigger the younger the generation. My current gf of a year still receives 3 to 5 dick pics from snapchat a month. Its a huge problem! I am literally trying to warn this girl about what shes in for. Because if shes American its so true. It's not exaggerated it's disgusting.
TooAfraidToAsk,fcnwz56,t1_fcnv71u,1577820104.0,"Wtf what? None of what I said was gross, hyperbole or ridiculous. If OP is American which it sounded like she was, and she is about to graduate high school and go to college, and is wondering why boys are weird now, then she should know about what's headed her way the next few years. I'm only a few years older than OP. And I'm Male. If you dont think I have a good idea what I'm talking about then you're clearly not around this age. Yeah those boys will be quiet and awkward now. But that quietness and awkwardness can later be guys who, yeah, mean no harm, but still dont know how to approach a girl. So they're creepy, weird and can come across as offputting. I have yet to meet a girl my age that hasnt recieved somewhere in the neighborhood of a few dicks pics a week to several a day. It's disgusting. Buts its reality. If you want to say wtf, say wtf to the world shes growing up in and will have to deal with. Theres no reason to insulate people from the shit that is reality. You may not like it, hell I dont like it. But it is what is is."
BeAmazed,fcnw1zc,t1_fcnsw3u,1577819580.0,"I think 23, 24 ft was close ish to my high schools record back in the day. But as someone who used to long jump and wasnt very good at it, I could long jump in the 18-20 ft range. This jump is totally possible. I actually think based off the dudes ability to land so smoothly he could jump probably jump much further and could be good at it with coaching."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcnu6b4,t3_ei5sew,1577818483.0,Give it literally 2 years. When they're 19 you'll wish they leave you alone because now at 19 were hitting the faux confidence of someone who believes they know everything and are a god. And on top of all that are super horny and will never leave you alone  again. Expect constant dick pics if you dont already get those and super awkward dudes asking you out and generally being creepy because no one taught them how to interact with girls. College is awesome!
JusticeServed,fcnpsl3,t1_fcnp3er,1577816146.0,"Sir you have pricked a sore spot for many people here when it comes to their guns. A good portion here believes life cannot exist without it and that someones always going to kill them or come to take their guns. The other half here really doesnt care about guns. They just dont want to be shot. But the most important thing to remember is the loudest people are the ones who love their guns. So they're the ones who are going to constantly be offended by jokes about guns. Hell I'll get downvoted to hell for saying this. Even as someone who owns a fucking gun in this country. The gun culture here is nuts.

And also I appreciated the sarcasm. I thought it was pretty funny and actually deserved for America. If you cant laugh at your own faults then you dont have a good sense of humor. Americas got problems. And some of them involve guns. *Gasp*"
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcl8x51,t3_ehpilv,1577742363.0,Path of Exile is actually pretty close to Diablo. And it seems to have an insane amount of options on how to build your characters. From someone who typically finds those games more than what I bargain for PoE is an amazing game to lose hours into.
LifeProTips,fcflbm0,t1_fcd0xmk,1577631260.0,Thanks Louis C.K!
ShouldIbuythisgame,fc6nh8s,t1_fc6e7up,1577484772.0,Great strategy game. Get it on PC if the controller will work with that version. The console versions are so far behind in updates it's not even the same game. And all the quality of life improvements arent there making it a pain to play
todayilearned,fc6n16e,t1_fc6jb40,1577484457.0,Some people will take anything too seriously and too far.
unpopularopinion,fc6lr6n,t3_egcaxa,1577483569.0,Good male role models are a good fix. Grew up fatherless. Role was filled by men throughout my life who taught me what it means to be a father and how to treat a family and those around me.
unpopularopinion,fc4dzll,t3_efxxv5,1577413918.0,"You're not wrong. Theres a definite want for recreational marijuana with the medical. But to be fair I also think the lack of research isnt enough to not legalize it. We know the LD50 of marijuana. And it is well out of the realms of physically possible for any human. Theres yet to be found a physiological dependence to it like there is with alcohol. I am a firm believer there are definite health drawbacks from the actual inhalation of the smoke. But on the flip side marijuana is weird because it has ended up working for diseases and processes we have not found anything to be effective with. I'm thinking about seizures when I say that or other neurological issues. I know for myself, I discovered that my IBS which the doctors have yet to figure out the cause and or any effective treatments against, is abated by marijuana. They have found cannabinoid receptors on almost every organ in your body. There are very few substances our body has this many receptors for. Opiates are one if I'm not mistaken. And Sugar is another. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong about that. 

Marijuana truly could hold the cure for things we just have to quit being afraid of the plant that smells like a skunk. And quit allowing ignorant idiots to dominate the argument about it. Marijuana isnt harmless. But to compare it to our current legal recreational substances (alcohol, tobacco) and say it's just as dangerous is disingenuous at best."
