That is a wonderful idea but it's encrusted with old kitty slobber and gooshy foods.  The grossness makes our seeming refusal to throw it away that much weirder.   Thank you, though! I appreciate the kind words and thought!"

He was taking his meals on the pad for the last year or so that we were graced with his presence.

He died in November.  Neither my husband nor I have managed to remove it. It's gross and covered in ground in food (toward the end he preferred to take meals on the pad), and really really needs to just get pitched, but there it sits, gently warming for no one.
What has really helped us cope has been the identical cousin kitten who showed up at our house the week before we had to put our cat to sleep. He's not actually related, but he's a ginger marble tabby just like our old kitters.  He's made such a difference. Make a new friend. Save a life.
