Try being that successful without being open to and actively seeking out criticism.

(Same goes for pro athletes. They need to be open to criticism.)

Edit: downvotes indicated it's not clearly why. 

criticism is an important part of improving. when they say a player is 'coachable' that's what this means. they're open to being criticized. when a player says they played bad, this is them being self critical. professional athletes in general are exceptional at this. that's how they were able to get so good. always accepting criticism and getting better.

a lot of people can't do this well, it's human nature to make excuses for ourselves. but the types of people who become billionaires and buy teams do not fit that mold. they did something really, really well. likely business and/or investing. you don't get great at those by having thin skin and not being able to own up to your mistakes."

Entrepreneur,febvuzl,t1_febsfpq,1578963358.0,"That is obviously not a bad portfolio but it's not diversified well if the aim is for that money to last you a lifetime (which it can, living modestly). 

Look into Modern Portfolio Theory. It's a big rabbit hole but if you learn it's lessons you will likely end up with a portfolio like the one I listed.

My IRA is:

* 40%	VTI
* 20%	VWO
* 20%	VEA
* 10%	VNQ
* 10%	EMB

And taxable:

* 50% VTI
* 30% VWO
* 20% VEA

MPT in a nutshell: by spreading out the risk over asset classes with lower correlation, you increase your overall returns and reduce your overall risk.

Crypto is actually excellent for this. I think everyone should have 1% of BTC or something in their portfolio as it has very low correlation to other asset classes and theoretically huge returns in the long run. As counterintuitive as it seems, a bit of crypto can actually reduce the overall risk in a portfolio."
