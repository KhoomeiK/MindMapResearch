Relapse is hard, but full of lessons. What were the factors? What were the feelings? Some people find journaling a relapse helpful. 

My sponsor would want to know if I were concerned that they were tiring of me. They say they are would want to know if I have that perception (and I did once and I was wrong).

Maybe something else to hone in on here is honesty. In relapse I have found a shift slightly to stopping dishonesty vs trying to stop self pity to be a bit more productive.
