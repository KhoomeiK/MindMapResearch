singing,fffn3cx,t1_fffm4b5,1579887513.0,Thank you. Yeah mine got expensive so I've been off for almost two years now (!) But recently signed up for an 8 week course (one class a week which gives me enough time to practice in between- fwiw I think once a month might be a bit far apart! But it's a solid investment in yourself)  that ends with a final lesson of me on stage with a live band to do a few songs. Your post really will stick in my mind to keep it fun and keep learning. Thanks! Good luck to you too.

ehlersdanlos,ff4qq1i,t3_er8wap,1579570161.0,">.< yessss. Sigh. Repeatedly. It’s infuriating. But I’m so glad forums like this exist so I can understand it all better. Every single time I’m astounded I splat so hard. Then I rest hard until I’m capable of moving about like a somewhat normal person, then I have major imposter syndrome and wonder if I’m even ‘sick’ at all and question everything, then I overdo it functioning way above normal, then splat....the process continues. But, it’s the only way I’ve lived my live till now. It’s been a crazy cycle that I keep fooling myself with in order to meet my goals and survive."
