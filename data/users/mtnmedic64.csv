Dogfree,ff4g5jc,t3_erkqg7,1579562811.0,"Now, I don't hate dogs. In fact, I like them (most breeds) and grew up with a Norwegian Elkhound as a kid. But, as a course of the career I chose it made owning a dog impractical. Also, being an independent man who hasn't had and doesn't really want to have kids, I've come to realize dogs need about as much attention and work as kids, which is also another reason why I don't want a dog. I like them, I just don't want to deal with them. I have cats and even though they can be little shits sometimes, they pose far fewer problems or risks plus they're independent like me and they don't require nearly as much attention or work as a dog, kid or some other exotic pet.

That said, I got into a relationship with a woman who has a small yapper. Even though he wasn't trained and there'd be a lot of adjusting to do for everyone when she moved into my house with him, I figured it could work since she would be around to help. Wrong. I ended up getting stuck with taking care of the dog's needs, letting him in/out, go looking for him if he got out of the yard, putting up with his constant yapping, etc.  She occasionally bathed and clipped him, but that's it. Then her daughter's dog came to stay with us ""only for a few months"" which turned into three long years.

Neither one of us really wanted to deal with her daughter's dog but she begged and begged her mother to keep him out here (because he bit a kid in a city park-all that has blown over but the court fined her heavily and required the dog to be registered and set up as a ""dangerous animal"" with restrictions-none of which was ever done, hence he was brought here as this is a different county). The daughter rarely ever came to visit her dog and never really sent any money or did anything to help with the upkeep of her dog while she and her boyfriend went to concerts, travelled, etc.

So I got stuck dealing with him because he's 70lbs and my ex- like her daughter- was too small and not strong enough to handle him whenever he got out of control. I tried training him, but I was criticized by both of them because of the command structure as being ""mean"". Ugh. There are times I've had to literally pick the damn thing up and carry him to the back door and put him outside because he was being so stubborn. The shedding, the stink, all the barking, the chaos, the ruined carpet, the occasional fight between the two dogs, the constant whining and begging for food and whatnot, the chasing my cats, the getting up on all the furniture, the not being able to have ""us"" time WITHOUT EITHER dog, having to figure out ""what to do with the dogs"" whenever we wanted to go somewhere, me having to find the big dog every time HE got out of the yard, listening to HER complain about their barking, and so forth...just...wore me down incredibly.

The amount of stress these dogs and her indifference regarding what it brought me, my cats and my home was tremendous. I stayed in this relationship for 5 years too long. When she left, she took her little dog with her, took the big dog back to her daughter whom, I believe, had complained that she'd have to give him away.  Daughter and her BF live in a nice house with a roommate who is afraid of the dog but they're not supposed to have a dog there anyway and they never made any effort to find a home they could have WITH the dog because cost. However, she afforded $4000 on a really nice car but could've got a more basic car, put some money into getting her driver license back, pay the fines on the dog, etc. and put some of that money as a pet deposit so he could stay with ""'mommy"". Basically, both of these people were expecting ME to take care of THEIR animals while they could go off and have fun together, etc. I already had a ton of stuff to take care of, including my own cats-for whom I've never really asked anyone's help with.

I've come to learn quite the hard way that people who have untrained dogs make difficult partners because they, themselves, don't want to put the time, money, effort, work into doing what is REQUIRED to have a dog, so they stress out and expect a partner to help deal with the dog and make excuses for the dog ""because that's what dogs do"". Or they're way too busy with the dog to pay much attention to you. Basically like someone who has a kid-they love the kid, but the kid is just too demanding of their time and attention so either they're way too into their kid to spare any time for you or they want someone to help them with the kid. That's all fine and dandy if you have a partner who's into dogs/kids, etc. I'm not. That's why I have cats. Like me, they're independent and the effort, money and time required to take care of them is far less demanding. I can actually go out for a weekend without having to plan on what ""to do"" with them. Plus they're QUIET.

Don't make the same mistake I did. Love conquers all, surely, but if that love is one-way/conditional upon you helping to fulfilli a requirement of burden that another person took up and is rather unwilling to take up, it's NOT going to do much for you, your happiness and well-being."
