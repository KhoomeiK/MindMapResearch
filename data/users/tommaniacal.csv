pokemon,fg1f6ni,t1_fg0y5mk,1580426011.0,"Rock grass and ice are all tied for me. 

Grass has 5 weaknesses but is immune to spore moves and resists water and ground

Rock has 5 weaknesses but is great offensively and gets a spdef boost in sand

Ice has 4 weaknesses and no resistances but is great offensively

Bug is pretty decent defensively with only 3 weaknesses and resists Fighting and Ground, it just isn't good offensively"

zelda,ffpx95v,t1_ffop4eh,1580109386.0,"The original mine used to craft the Megaton hammer. It is the only location that contains Goddess Ore, the very metal used to craft the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, and Megaton Hammer. 

After the gorons defeated Volvagia, their greed led them to exploit the mine, digging deeper than the goddesses permitted. It seems that they dug into the demon realm itself, for it quickly swarmed with monsters and spirits. The gorons quickly were overwhelmed, and had no choice but to seal the mine, waiting for the hero to reclaim the sacred mine.

Design-wise it is similar to the Fire Temple in Oot and the Goron Mines in TP. It contains a vast array of lava lakes and ancient machinery. The dungeon is a labyrinth of mine shafts that all connect to a vast lava area. There are platforming and climbing sections that require avoiding lava and fire. The enemies are covered in metal, and are completely immune to damage with their armor, but have open weak points that can be exploited.

The Steel-Eater's Mine is located somewhere between the Goron Mines and the original Fire Temple, and connected the two before it was sealed."
musictheory,ffk2e4r,t3_etv2we,1580013696.0,"I'm not sure you understand what dominants are. When referring to scales they're the fifth scale degree. When referring to chords they're a major triad with a minor 7th. In the scale you provided G and D are neither of those.

The notes you provided are from G Harmonic minor, but depends on which scale degree is the tonic or ""home note""

G - Harmonic minor

A - Locrian #6
