Foodforthought,ff5rufr,t1_ff4jkst,1579607813.0,"I'll never understand you ""Let's just go live in space!"" types. Space fucking sucks! The only reason you think otherwise is because Star Trek and the like told you it was cool. It's not. It's an inhospitable hell.

We cannot survive without fuckloads of expensive equipment. The only reason to go is to try to find a similar Earth-like planet, which is looking increasingly unlikely, at least anywhere ""nearby"", ""nearby"" of course being at least a few *millennia* of travel time with current propulsion technology.

Even if you think this can all be worked out, the vast majority of us, well over 99%, are stuck here regardless. Maybe a better solution would be to figure out a way to save the *only* known place in the entire universe that you can walk outside and not instantly die?"

moderatepolitics,feouyfh,t1_feoqnzv,1579305974.0,"This is something I absolutely hate about Reddit, the Internet, people, whatever. We all just *assume* the other person's position and pat each other on the back for not being like *those* idiots.

Reddit can't even argue against flat-earthers and anti-vaxxers successfully. ""Duh, why don't they just go in a plane and see the curvature of the Earth for themselves?"" Have YOU been in an airplane?! It's not high enough to see the curvature. ""Well, even if vaccinations cause autism in a few cases, the diseases they protect against are still worth it."" Ok, but anti-vaxxers typically argue that it does NOT protect against ANY disease AND it also causes autism.

I'm not arguing that these positions are not deeply, deeply wrong and, in many cases, just stupid. But if you're going to argue against stupidity, at least get it right."

LetsTalkMusic,fecgro6,t3_eoeg6a,1578973542.0,"There's value in learning to appreciate (almost) any kind of music (maybe stay away from Nazi metal and the like), but there's nothing wrong with not wanting to invest the time in something that doesn't grab your interest.

Pop is such a diverse ""genre"" that it's really no surprise that someone would not get most of it. Even avid pop-listeners don't enjoy much of it, they may even be more critical of it as a result of listening to it all the time.

If there's anything that makes pop what it is though, it's supposed to grab your attention and hook you as soon as possible. If it doesn't do this, it likely fails as a pop song. How this works changes very quickly.

Pop even 5 years ago sounds very different to now. Pop 10 years ago sounds out of another era. Pop 20 years ago sounds completely ancient. It's a revolving door of trends and sounds that is difficult to classify other than that it's just what sounded good to people at the time."

LetsTalkMusic,fe6ex10,t1_fe697nf,1578888859.0,"True. I agree that Weezer will be remembered longer. Their first 3 albums are undeniably influential, whereas Panic has that ""closing the goddamn door"" song and a string of forgettable crap."
LetsTalkMusic,fe67g7z,t1_fe5i3ij,1578883490.0,"Yeah, but it was a fluke based on a meme. Outside of that, they've done nothing of consequence since, what, Pork & Beans? Brandon Urie is collaborating with Taylor Swift. Weezer probably wins in overall influence over time, but as it stands now, Panic is undoubtedly more relevant."

PrequelMemes,fda4zyd,t1_fd9m5v3,1578241757.0,"So, he brought balance to the Force by doing what? The prophecy has been completely distorted to mean nothing at this point. It didn't make sense when the Empire still existed and it makes no sense at all if Palpatine is still around. Balance to the Force should be just that.

He fails because the attempts at humor are just bad. And am I alone in flat out not understanding him at all sometimes? When they're in the underwater bongo, he says something like ""two little itty bitty accidenties"" and then I cannot for the life of me understand anything else.

Today's ""critics"" are just a bunch of Buzzfeed minimum wage teenagers who know nothing about film. They're no more valid than anyone else's opinion."
