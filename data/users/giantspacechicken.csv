I can’t wait. I fixed windows for reasons and it’s made Java add ons easier to deal with (I love linux and will still be using it with Minecraft but for some reason Manjaro was a pain with Java add-ons and I’m under too much mental health stress atm to deal with the hassle). 

In the meantime I’m playing Bedrock version (which I now have on Windows not just phone) and awaiting the update. There are differences between the versions and features of Java I loved. I’m not playing Java until optifine because it’s not very playable on my old machine. Optifine helps so much.
