AskReddit,feu6yq9,t3_eqmhiw,1579383745.0,My step grandma killed my grandpa while he was in the hospital by not giving him his medicine. She accidentally sent an email to my father instead of her friend where she admitted to skipping the medicine and that she changed the will so that everything would go to her rather than my grandpas three kids. My dad brought it to court but the court said that since it was an email there really wasn’t any evidence because the email could have been fake or changed.

teenagers,feu2ll2,t3_eqmjbh,1579382522.0,"There’s no exact timeline. Honestly, go for when you feel most comfortable. I think I invited my boyfriend to hang out in my room like after the second date. Maybe talk to your girlfriend and see if she has any expectations/thoughts on it and go from there."

disneyparks,fej2232,t1_feiyc0j,1579154039.0,But it can actually come out. They used to do shows where they would have all these teens and dads line up to try and then it would a little kids turn and they’d actually pull it out. I think they have a setting where it can be pulled out but it’s normally off so that people can just take pictures. I could be wrong but I definitely remember watching a show like that when I was little.
