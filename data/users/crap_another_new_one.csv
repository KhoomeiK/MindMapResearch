TIHI,ff25fqb,t3_eqxxo3,1579494318.0,"Man, I once was out in the country when I was a young kid. Took a huge emergency dump behind a tree...nothing to wipe. I had the worst butt rash a few hours later. lol Wiping is universally important haha"
gaming,fetv49n,t1_fets13i,1579380347.0,"Or.... realize that there is a mixture of good and bad people everywhere! The issue is a ruling elite of wealthy. Everywhere! Some places its super overt-China. Others, less so. But the veil is being lifted as they continue to gain power."
funny,feo9fjt,t1_fenwpk6,1579296905.0,Until Amazon opens up more stores. Lol. Makes me grumpy everytime I see an amazon bookstore.
funny,feo966l,t1_feo5yj5,1579296745.0,I wonder if that’s true. At least we started adding sales tax to amazon
combinedgifs,fehgdy2,t1_fegxmzm,1579115990.0,This was one of the best I’ve seen. Nice job!!
SeattleWA,fdrzdno,t1_fdryosi,1578691963.0,Well. Again. It’s all perspective. I wouldn’t call it a handout.  But we are not going to align based upon a Reddit thread. Definitely grateful they are working on some of those big global issues.
SeattleWA,fdrxr14,t1_fdrx44i,1578691324.0,"This isnt about making lives more convenient for a few people. This is advancing environmental protection. This is about enabling poor people to have access to higher paying jobs. Its about enabling parents to be home for their children and keep jobs. Let’s not minimize the importance of public transit. But yes, Bill was an example as is transit. I meant much more broadly."
SeattleWA,fdru8gu,t1_fdr02pl,1578689784.0,"Man, I know peeps love some Bill Gates but with his access to resources he could accelerate so much. I get frustrated w/all these billionaires claiming they are giving their money away....just not as fast as they are earning it."
Futurology,fdr3on5,t1_fdqyek9,1578679083.0,Thank you. My utility is investigating it presently. I wasn’t clear on how it would help. Seems like there is an abundance of NG and all leads to greenhouse gases.
Futurology,fdqm7bs,t1_fdqfyw4,1578669988.0,What about renewable natural gas? I see how some utilities are beginning to invest in projects for that. Any knowledgeable folks here on hownit compares?

funny,fdiluna,t1_fdhx73i,1578445792.0,Walmart and Amazon will employ America. The new two-party political system will be Marts v the Zons. The future is bright.
movies,fdca9dl,t1_fdbkvqj,1578270204.0,Man i loved that movie. I’m not even exactly sure why. Definitely shot beautifully.
dataisbeautiful,fd7c7ak,t1_fd6uze7,1578202234.0,Thats what I was afraid of. Too hot.
dataisbeautiful,fd66hf2,t1_fd660z7,1578186212.0,"Thank you. Yes, it definitely seems attributable to climate change. Definitely wasn’t trying to make excuses. Just was curious."
dataisbeautiful,fd63j3g,t1_fd5thel,1578185041.0,"Sincere question. This in no way is an attempt to minimize how absolutely terrifying and unfortunate this is first for Australia and then the world. 

In the US there are forests that need to burn as part of their lifecycle. Is there anything positive that can come from these fires? Obviously the scale is beyond horrifying. Just curious if any of these lands burning need it?"
facepalm,fcz8dbr,t1_fcz3fti,1578095733.0,I’m less embarrassed about my personal ignorance now. :-). That’s pretty funny.
facepalm,fcyymzq,t1_fcyquot,1578089979.0,"I’m a little embarrassed, but never really understood that until now. Thanks. We have it in the US now too. But as the other commenter mentions, I always thought it was Independant... but wondered why it was always so stylistically similar. Finally makes sense. Haha"
BeAmazed,fcyawjv,t1_fcy0ocp,1578077369.0,I wish we would stop repeating the mantra our overlords give us. We are first humans. Second Americans (obviously not talking to everyone). Lets focus on the challenges and solutions we can agree upon. Let’s stop the retoric. Republicans v Democrats is bullshit we need to get over. Both parties do good and bad.  These problems are immensely complicated. And every solution has pros and cons.
FoundPaper,fct9hoa,t1_fct96ng,1577936482.0,Yes. Great question. I’m also wondering how the toilette paper was placed on the vehicle.
FoundPaper,fct93mf,t1_fct7p29,1577936174.0,I’m guessing the car is poorly parked then left a long time. Odd analogy with the toilette paper.
shitty_housing,fct7c9p,t1_fct79hx,1577934793.0,There ya go. I’ll believe that.
shitty_housing,fct3ye0,t3_eim1xd,1577932258.0,"We are seeing these without context to the building wherein they reside. I was considering a scendario where they would be OK. And, well, there isn't one. These are an abomination and the building should be burned down."

todayilearned,fcitwmh,t1_fcii7rz,1577669713.0,"He held out for a while, thought he would be rich, they moved on without him and built a massive hotel literally on his house.  Hopefully someone will come along that knows more."
todayilearned,fcig8fy,t1_fci4f8t,1577662064.0,"There is a famous house connected to a hotel in Amsterdam. He held out. Never got the money he wanted. Committed suicide because it was so noisy living next to construction.

E. I learned it on a canal tour. I tried to search for it but was unsuccessful.

E2. Looks like there is even s as movie about it, although what I’ve read doesn’t validate (or deny )the suicide part

television,fchuna6,t1_fch77je,1577654342.0,The ROI on that investment is a no brainer for netflix. 100% they have extremely detailed metrics. Especially with browser viewers.
LightRoast,fcakx1m,t1_fc9mtcv,1577571235.0,Its too nice to use but could make a great place to hang clean clothes
mildlyinteresting,fc1lsjz,t1_fc1hz1r,1577322608.0,I was wondering. From Texas but never have seen one before

crappyoffbrands,fc1ex3q,t1_fc0tdag,1577316718.0,Holy cow. The truth was there this whole time. No wonder the birth certificate was such a big deal. You just blew this wide open.
Justrolledintotheshop,fc1ek88,t1_fc1cr5h,1577316410.0,That’s what we did. Moved far away and have been so happy since. It’s a risk but I’m glad we did it.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fc1cmkl,t3_efiffg,1577314767.0,I bought that dog pillow too and went completely unused. Such a waste of money.
