HumansBeingBros,ffj0qap,t1_ffitele,1579987466.0,"I was on vacation in Mexico two years ago. I met some people as usual amd we hung out every night. One night we were getting drunk and met this new couple and their 19 year old friend. She was tiny in frame and was definitely a lightweight in drinking. We took a round of shots and 3 guys refused the shots so the girl stood up and drank the 3 shooters. A few moments later she went to her room to change and after a while I noticed it took her a while so I asked her friend that we go check on her. 

I knocked on her door and there was no answer so we used her friend's card to enter. She wasn't in her room so I checked the bathroom and noticed her laying in the tub with water running down and filling up the tub. It was at that moment she just slipped and went under water and her friend froze still, but adrenaline took me over and I ran to get her up. 

She then woke up and was having trouble breathing, then doing this crazy laugh and then losing consciousness. The other people gathered around and stood in shock and nobody was doing anything, but stay and look in shock until I specifically started telling people what to do then all of a sudden everyone was doing what they were told. 

I layed the girl on her bed, told her friend to change her clothes while the guys left the room, brought her to her side, woke her up (she was still hysterically laughing occasionally), made her chug down glasses of water to make her vomit and it worked. After she threw up she was feeling better. The next day she felt bad about the situation and was apologizing, but she didn't need to. A good thing out of this is that the resort upgraded our return ticket to 1st class, that was nice :)"

videos,feksm1f,t1_fejz7w9,1579206749.0,"Imagine the adrenaline. Holy shit I got goosebumps just thinking about it. I remember seeing a huge 3 car accident and I was with my big brother joking around, but when we saw the huge accident happen in front of us we just both got out of the car and ran towards the accident to help the victims. Our mother is a nurse and she taught us what to do and how to react. I had her on the phone while assisting the victims and she guided me what to do and how to do it safely. I can't imagine running after kidnappers. Holy shit. Great iob!"

I've had a really shitty day at work today and a shitty day in general, but once I left my client's office and was about to face traffic the only thing that made me smile was knowing that when my car would pull up on my streets, my dog smells the car from far and awaits me by the window, scratching at the door to get out and greet me ([https://streamable.com/58yn3](https://streamable.com/58yn3)). Then he greets me by rushing towards the first sock or toy he can find and brings it to me to show it off then I drop my bag on the ground, sit down and he jumps on my lap and ""hugs"" me and gives me kisses.

Even my parents still have the old school Bosnian mentality, but I have Croatian and Serbian friends and my parents were always accepting that and they raised me not to hate our neighbors. How old are you?"
todayilearned,feewgo5,t1_feeus0y,1579042715.0,"Hahaha! There's quite a few of us here. Between 1995-1999 thousands of us got sent to Quebec. There were a lot of us at the beginning. We were refugees in Germany for 7 years and then half of us were sent to Canada and the other half to Australia, but the cold/winter was really harsh for a lot them so they waited for their citizenship and moved elsewhere.

ChoosingBeggars,fdru0dy,t1_fdrev5b,1578689650.0,"Report the reviews. Google will remove it. On behalf of my client I reported some unfair reviews (such as 3x1-star reviews without a comment by 3 different usernames containing the same name). It was a former employee who got fired for selling cocaine to his clients while at work so he got mad and made 3 accounts with the same name and profile picture. It brought down the average score to 4.6/5. After filing the reports Google removed it and the average score is legit now at 4.8/5

It did take back and forth communication and multiple reports before it was removed, but it worked!"
