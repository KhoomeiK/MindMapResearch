AmItheAsshole,ffvujgu,t1_ffvu1rn,1580273663.0,I was actually feeling guilty because she seemed pretty genuine with her concern and had good intentions.
AmItheAsshole,ffvtsf0,t1_ffvsr5a,1580273041.0,She was actually genuinely worried I had anorexia?
AmItheAsshole,ffvqbja,t1_ffvpra3,1580270311.0,"I usually rotate spring mix and arugula and add some bell peppers. She occasionally get strawberry tops/ a mixture. 

She hates iceberg and romaine lettuce actually. The darker the veggies, the yummier."

AmItheAsshole,ffvemeq,t1_ffvefhb,1580262316.0,"That’s what I thought at first. Maybe she was making a joke because of the veggies, which would’ve gotten me mad because you shouldn’t joke about mental illness like that. But when she started going more into it, she seemed like she genuinely meant it. When I clarified it was for my bunny, showing my lock screen of my bunny, she said no way a rabbit can eat that much salad."
ems,ffnjpw3,t3_et5qkq,1580066860.0,"People are so stupid. Broke a leg? Sure. We’ll take you to the hospital. But a pinky? A FUCKING PINKY?!?

And they don’t even have that great of an insurance. So they’ll be paying for the bill. How can you be so fucking stupid?"
Rabbits,ffn4wad,t3_eu5dbo,1580062115.0,My bunnies like the cheap food more. It’s just the expensive food are healthier.
PublicFreakout,ffmx3a0,t1_ffm43e6,1580059789.0,Most racist people don’t think they’re racist. They would probably think that the lady is wrong but like they would still be racist in their everyday lives.
AskReddit,ffkoa1w,t3_ett7fr,1580026050.0,"I used the Asian menstrual pad my mom gave me because she swore it felt “so clean.”

It felt nice for 2 seconds. Then the minty feeling stopped and I remembered I’m allergic to lots of things with fragrance and I wonder if this feeling would count as a fragranc-

Ended up going to the ER and now I can barely get around my house. On top of that, period cramps are still a bitch."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffkmere,t1_ffite43,1580025159.0,"Ambulances in my municipal are free because we’re volunteers and we get lots of donations from the patients families that we almost never touch the budget the town allots is. But the ER bills are when you’re really gonna get fucked over. 

We also only take the patient and maybe one family member to the ER and once you get there, the nurses will watch you like hawks. So you’d have to wait 1/2 hour to 1 hour just to get to your bar with one buddy. Much easier to take a bus."
secretcompartments,ffkkqpt,t1_ffk8psb,1580024385.0,That suggestion made me vomit in my mouth.
news,ffkfyq8,t1_ffkfewh,1580022133.0,"[“According to a September 2019 study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(19)30163-X/fulltext) by Chinese published in The Lancet, there are about 88,100 influenza-related deaths every year in China, with a mortality rate of between 1.6% and 2.6%. The majority of those who died as a result of the flu were aged over 60, the report said.”

Granted not all areas of China have access to healthcare so this makes a lot more sense. You have rural Chinese villages that don’t even have access to schools."
PublicFreakout,ffkcu59,t1_ffk2fer,1580020671.0,I thought that the incubation period was why it took so long for the doctors to determine that the virus could spread human to human. They thought that it only spread from animal to human in the beginning.
PublicFreakout,ffkcmnj,t1_ffk88q5,1580020575.0,"It’s going to slip through the net in the US. Honestly it’s inevitable. The screenings at airports only account for those who already have symptoms and the incubation period for the new virus is estimated to be two weeks so those who are carriers of the virus will be allowed to enter. 

But we’re more prone to handwashing and hygiene and now that people are aware of the virus, hopefully it won’t be as bad. We also do have better medical care than China and have the advantage of knowing there’s a disease spreading around- unlike China who didn’t think the disease was spreading because of the incubation period. All we can do is hope for the best."
PublicFreakout,ffkc5dl,t1_ffk1ab9,1580020355.0,Plus Wuhan is a major travel hub for all those traveling for Chinese New Years.
news,ffkbpuv,t1_ffk4n5r,1580020163.0,"I was going by China’s percentage of those who die from the flu. Granted China’s healthcare system isn’t as great as the US’s. But the flu and this new coronavirus are both treated similarly, by treating the symptoms and complications that arise."
news,ffjzstu,t1_ffjwnk6,1580011491.0,"But out of the people infected only about 3-4% of people die. Most of the dead had other conditions and were already old. In comparison, the flu kills around 2-3% of people. 

SARS killed 10% of the infected and MERS killed 34%."
PublicFreakout,ffjzeug,t1_ffjuery,1580011179.0,It’s also not that fatal. Most fatalities were older people with other health issues.
PublicFreakout,ffjzbnc,t1_ffju4wk,1580011107.0,"Well, I understand being overworked and overwhelmed with patients. This virus has been spreading ridiculously quickly- which is honestly understandable given that it has a pretty long incubation period. Plus with travel bans, help probably won’t arrive from the government. 

What I’m suspicious about is that she’s already saying she’s watching people die. I understand in a couple weeks, when the population of the infected is much much higher. But this virus is only estimated to have a mortality rate of 3-4% with some sources believing it to be 2%. Much like the flu(1.4-2.6% mortality rate,) most of the fatalities are the elderly with underlying health conditions."
PublicFreakout,ffjz03w,t1_ffjw5ou,1580010851.0,"There’s actually a reason why it’s spreading so quickly. Theres an incubation period of 2 weeks so people don’t even have symptoms that they’re sick. How many people can you meet within 2 weeks, especially in a crowded Chinese city. A fast food worker could have the virus and not know because they won’t experience symptoms until 2 weeks later. They could easily infect hundreds within those two weeks of working. 

Then, people might wait to go to the hospital because they assume it’s the regular flu because the symptoms are so identical. That means you have to track down the people they’ve been in contact with from roughly a 2 and a half to 3 week period of not longer. Add in the fact that people are bypassing travel restrictions to visit family because it’s Lunar New Year- the busiest travel time of the year- and you have people spreading it everywhere.

It doesn’t have as bad of a mortality rate (3-4%) as MERS (34%) and SARS (10%) but its still worse than the flu (1.4-2.6%). Most people who’ve died had underlying health conditions and the elderly are the most at risk."
PublicFreakout,ffjyerc,t1_ffjqy9v,1580010382.0,"Thank god it’s not that lethal (3-4% mortality rate) as SARS was in 2002... The flu has a mortality rate of 1.6%-2.6% in China. SARS had around 10% and MERS had 34%. Most of the fatalities have been older people over 60 with underlying health conditions. 

The scary part is how quickly the disease is spreading. With an incubation period of 2 weeks, people don’t even have symptoms that they’re sick. Then, they wait to go to the hospital because they assume it’s the regular flu because the symptoms are so identical.
