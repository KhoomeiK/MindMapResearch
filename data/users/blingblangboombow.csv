I don't see how people in this community navigate the world if little shit like this is what's killing you I'm a younger person of color living in the most racist part of Virginia we still have the klan here down the road and I honestly do not know how I would be able to deal with ANYTHING if just them calling me ""blacks"" or whatever hateful bullshit they use destroyed me. At some point you realize that people are shity and that they( the racists) are not the majority of people. You people go the opposite route you say that the worst people like the incel (just men in general it seems) or whatever buzzword you come up with this week is the majority you dehumanize entire demographics  with bullshit generalizations and keep the cycle of misinformation pettiness and Hate going"

facepalm,ff3eu1q,t1_ff24rmt,1579539625.0,Just don't speak at all that's probably even better because even if you are right they scream that you're wrong
facepalm,ff3eml5,t1_ff2xiux,1579539509.0,You're right most people don't think about it and it's honestly a non-issue it's just a group of people NEEDING to bitch about something fuck walking on eggshells because certain groups have hijacked words this community lives in a bubble

nba,fenfjsj,t1_fenf0la,1579283603.0,Stop the bullshit you are reaching like hell this kind of trash is why the NBA Community is terrible this kind of shit is why people don't go to games it's why the views are down it's not the players it's the god awful fans I honestly thought soccer had it worse but no you people pick their narrative and then run with them and then that's the history of the NBA. not the actual history but just whatever narrative the fans decide to pick that day. These are actual talking points regurgitated by social media and ESPN EVERY TIME they talk about this man

nba,fen8i6r,t1_feizp8u,1579279288.0,"Are you people serious right now!? Are we gonna act like LeBron hasn't been shitting on his teammates passive aggressively for 10 years or when kobe did it what when Chris Paul talks that shit about his former teammates? You people have a REAL short memory it's like you hoes just started watching last year

Reggie Miller after losing in the playoffs shit on Jermaine O'Neal threw his other guard under the bus 
LeBron has a a whole saga of being shit to teammates in Miami and Cleveland 
What about John wall in the disappointing  2017 season 
Gilbert arenas after getting hurt the first time 
Do we even need to speak on all the things draymon has said to teammates?
Paul George in Indiana yelling at a teammate for taking an open three and then in the post game passive aggressively wants him to be traded
JIMMY FUCKING BUTLER and Dwayne wade on the bulls 
Jimmy butler in Minnesota as well
Kobe and pau kobe and Dwight Kobe and Shannon Brown Kobe and smush Parker

Come on this shit is ignorant NBA fans are whack"
nba,fen886k,t1_fejubuw,1579279115.0,"Bro what? You hoes have been shutting on him sense he left LeBron about EVERYTHING the media ONLY pays attention to his worst attitude.  That's fucling dishonest as hell NBA fans might be the worst in sports you people see a narrative and SPRINT with it kyrie has gotten nothing but hate what the hell do you mean ""it's the side of Kyrie that hasn't gotten any attention by the media or the fans at large."" Get out of here with that bs"
PurplePillDebate,fel0qm3,t1_fekzqsq,1579211576.0,I don't know how true that is but I've definitely seen my fair share of Snapchat/instagram videos just like that
PurplePillDebate,fekiqz9,t1_fekiam9,1579200895.0,"Because it's not fucking flirting for men. It's watching your step and trying to navigate this person who at the start has preconceived notions about you as a man. Also you don't get to write off other people worries women far too often think that men's worries aren't real just because it's not a problem for them or when THEY don't see it as a problem. ""Exposing"" or blasting people is very real and acting like it's not is corny as hell. Again the effort, the amount of time, and anxiety  some men feel is not worth all the bullshit ."
PurplePillDebate,fekhwlj,t3_epndym,1579200391.0,what's the point in putting in that amount of effort for little in return? A lot of men feel like the scale isn't really that balanced so why put in any more than a little bit of effort. Also the chance of getting socially destroyed by a very loud and public rejection is real. I don't think there are as many spaces to meet people either. I live in a rural area and online dating is the only way I could see finding anyone. Also meeting people in real life is much much harder than meeting someone online I don't even know how that's an argument
unpopularopinion,fejyj8o,t1_fejy9lg,1579188758.0,I don't even need to read all that becauae generalizations are not facts you don't research trash period .whatever that shit you are talking about had nothing to do with what you originally said you can't research what people might think and what people might do with the weed once it's completely legalized this entire thread is talking points
unpopularopinion,fejsj2r,t3_ep9up9,1579184784.0,"I have never been in a more over exaggerating community in my entire life. this isn't an unpopular opinion this is regurgitation this cookie cutter ""get alot a likes"" format is over blown ""Americans always (random made up problem) Americans are ignorant "" people love to hate Americans with dull baseless generalizations instead of ACTUAL criticism this post and the convo it started is a dumpster fire."

trashy,fbo4xi8,t1_fbo3smp,1577006899.0,"I said what I said  you keep trying to make it something else but the problem is exactly what the hell I said it was  the bad term AND the talking points associated with it are used to demonize and shut  down men PERIOD it's not used to talk about the issues it's used to blame people for the issues  you enjoy participating in your own demise 

your community constantly talks down at people and tells them that they need to be more self-aware but your community doesn't do that AT ALL you just dig your heels deeper and tell everyone else that they are wrong and that's bullshit"
