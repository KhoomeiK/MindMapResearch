Firstly, world hunger can't be ended overnight.

Secondly, increased stability across the world would lead to a liberation of the global proletariat and a subsequent overthrow of the domineering classes.

While half the world is dying of starvation, the poorest in the West are told to be thankful because it could be worse. You remove that, and suddenly what do Westerns have to make them feel better? We would no longer feel safe and secure within the tight grip of capitalism but rather strangled by it.

There are many many reasons why ending poverty is not in the best interests of those with the power to achieve such a thing, and none of them would be ""crippling to the planet"" whatever that means. A stronger global working class means a stronger global economy. Wealthy nation's waste money on useless foreign aid to give the impression they are trying to help, in the long run giving PROPER, SUSTAINABLE aid would not only save us money but it creates powerful trading partners for the future.

If you're a real abuser and want to take a much longer break than one week, I suggest going from your standard usage to no more than 2g a week, and once that has run out you just don't buy more until you've had enough time sober to satisfy you.
