Anyway! I have my old paladin for a character if you'd like :) What do you usually play? Or are you going to be the GM?"

My mom always respected my privacy and never went through my journals or my phone. If there's something she wants to know, she asks me. We're very open with one another and BECAUSE she doesn't force her way through my privacy I trust her completely."

teenagers,fekzsjf,t3_epldk3,1579211015.0,"Yeah reminds me of my first days in middleschool. I didn't know if we had assigned desks so I kinda just changed place at each class. It quickly annoyed the teachers who wanted to learn our names.
In highschool then, I wanted to always stay at the same place to not face this problem. And... The desks in most of em would change arrangement since we'd often change room. That... I was so not prepared for this.

lgbt,fecpie6,t3_eo8gts,1578980010.0,"Yeah reminds me when I told my mom I surely had depression and she just said ""it'll be ok"", ""we all feel like that sometimes"" etc... We saw some kind of therapist once and that was it. That was 4 years ago.
This summer, I tell her I feel pretty bad today, almost like when I was depressed (I'm not depressed anymore but sometimes I have this little blues). She listens to me and when I tell her I actually had plans to kill myself I saw her eyes grow wide as she finally understood that, nope, years ago I wasn't bullshitting her.
She felt pretty uneasy leaving me alone at home for a month after that even though I feel perfectly fine now.

And... Well, the pattern is repeating itself, this time with me questionning my sexuality. I think I might be bi, talked to her and she just thinks I might exaggerate... Welp."

rpghorrorstories,fecmqfd,t1_fe8t9wo,1578977759.0,Thanks and I'm glad you're out of such a situation too. It's crappy and like you said sometimes we just don't see the red flags.
rpghorrorstories,fe87iji,t1_fe65fze,1578923460.0,"Yeah I get that. One of my best friend was actually in love with him but then fell for another person online. And this person was like him but worse, very manipulative and horrible, ready to put his life on the line just to win an arguement and so that she never leaves. She never quite got rid of him and that's when I remember that I also saw a lot of red flags around him (being extremely silent when 2 people other than him and my friend were present, saying he hated us for no reason, would shout horrible things near his 10 year old girl because, yes, he has a child) when well she didn't. So yeah, it can be hard... It's surely harder when in the situation.
I'll be honest, my first thought when he told me he tried to kill himself was that I felt incredibly sorry for causing so much woe when... Damn, that's not my fault."
facepalm,fe6budr,t3_enraoq,1578886461.0,"Yeah reminds me, there was this street in Geneva where they cut down all the trees (they were all in a line and there was even a big green part they cut down to build something). All I can remember is that people tagged a lot the construction site, demanding they replant the trees more or less politely."

rpghorrorstories,fe658wo,t1_fe4g1vo,1578882070.0,"Yeah I kinda got that when I rejected him. I was, I think, very nice when rejecting saying that we'll still be friends and nothing will change that cause I value him... But he straight up told me that when he heard I was not single anymore, he tried to off himself. Annnd well when someone uses suicide as a persuasion method, it just shows that they can be pretty manipulative.
He's not a bad friend but I see that he would have been a horrible romantic partner, basing his entire world view on the person he's dating. I'll be honest, he's part of the reason I broke up with my boyfriend at the time and didn't date for two years.

But now it's cool, my boyfriend is a really sweet guy and I couldn't have asked for a better friend :)"
rpghorrorstories,fe3kbgk,t3_enlq5q,1578850069.0,"I feel you.
I'm friends with a DM who was one of my first experience as a player (I used to only DM) and he actually admitted to having feelings for me. I rejected him (saying that we should stay friends and stuff since I just began going out with someone else at the time) and... Well he didn't take it well at all. But we acted as if everything was ok.
I noticed that during ALL OF OUR GAMES he would favour me and he would always send me a private message saying ""ok, so, now you gotta kill everyone.""
And.. I didn't want to? Like we had a Death Note game where I became Kira and I never wanted to kill my friends but he kinda forced me to since when I didn't and gave away the book, he used an NPC to finish the job, leaving only me standing.
Then in a Skyrim one, he told me to poison all the potions I made for my friends so that I could get a rare daedric artifact.
Even in another one shot, he told me that I was controlled and was to kill my friends.
I stopped playing with him afterwards. I wasn't feeling in control and most of the time he would give me very overpower stuff. And I was practically unkillable at this point. At a moment my character got at - 10 HP, I should have died anf he said that noooo my God decided to let me live if I do some stuff for him.

Sooo... Yeah. Unless you have a great DM as a boyfriend, don't date. Like, my current boyfriend is also a DnD player but as far as I see, he's being pretty fair with my character."

lgbt,fdqf19s,t3_emkxw6,1578664988.0,"Reminds me of the class of my best friend. She told me that last year her class was super accepting of the LGBT community but this year it is the contrary. Even her brother who I've known since he was like 6 currently thinks that gay men someone ""lack virility"" or something and that homosexuality in general is no gucci.
Makes me greatly reconsider my friendship with her brother but also makes me ask questions about her relationships with other people in the class. That's really sad."

facepalm,fdjf127,t3_elcm78,1578468048.0,"Reminds me of when I was in middleschool, after PE, the teacher told us the gate was closed and we had to go climb over it. It was maybe 2m80 tall so let's just say I didnt want to do it. I was the last one to go through and, just in case, I decided to just push it in the right direction. It glided to the side and opened. All the students rushed to the door and pushed it, and began laughing. The teacher just set us up and no doubt he would have opened the door at the end just to laugh at us (he was like that).
All in all it was funny and I didn't even have to climb the gate.
TL;DR: Always check if it's open by pushing it, gliding it etc..."

But the real question is : does the good ol' sex actually happens anyway or you gotta convince the person? Cause in this case, I'm never having my $600K.

For this one, it was just a test. I have no intent to animate it. It was just a way to see what my level in pixel art is at the beginning of the year and how much progress I'm going to do. But yeah, I'm going to do a version with less details when animating the character :)"
PixelArt,fdajx0j,t1_fdaf7c1,1578246890.0,"Thanks you :D

Yeah I kinda wanted to go for a more """"""realistic"""""" look since it's a more serious type of game so I might really need to up the number of pixels for this one. But yeah, it does feel off. I'll redo it later :D

I only really noticed it once I posted it. Now that I look at it, it looks more like a frame in an walking cycle than a standing pose. I'll fix that in a definitive version :)

Thank you for the feedback!! I really appreciate it!"
