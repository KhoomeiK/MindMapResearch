On an unrelated note.If I'm making mead, what do I use to kill the yeast without changing the entire mead's taste?"
todayilearned,ffgzi11,t1_fffsbqj,1579919078.0,"I mean. Some vegan substitutes like tofu can be prepared in super tasty ways. It's just the copying meat part that failed.

Plant based meat seems to be working. Once if becomes affordable, I might switch to that too."
todayilearned,ffgz5ed,t3_etdp9j,1579918815.0,Neat. Probably cheaper too.

MurderedByWords,fff4ipq,t3_et9uqq,1579875496.0,"I'd assume that the comic book would have to tackle the samr political problems as X-Men comics, but in this case the charge against supers would likely be lead by KKK and other Extremists, using people's fear of super-powered people to rally them behind their cause.

Since vice is reporting on it, I'm not sure it's actually a good comic or done well.

I should go and check it out to see if it's actually good and thoughtful or just an attempt at activism with a bad comic as result. Or just decent."
