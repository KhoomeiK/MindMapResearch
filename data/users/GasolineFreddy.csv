trashy,ff4bh1c,t1_ff4agj8,1579559718.0,"Just  because changing something is difficult doesn’t mean it’s not worth trying. We could absolutely improve how animals are reared, and slaughtered and still feed society. It just wouldn’t be good for Shareholders and profit margins.

I’ve read the rest of your comments In this thread though, and I know I’m not getting anywhere with you.  So Q E fucking D I guess."
trashy,ff4a1sb,t1_ff46f8v,1579558817.0,"I mean so have I, I’ve also seen the conditions animals in the meat/fur industry are kept in, its kind of an apple/orange situation.

The deer got to move around and live a life before I shot it.  Lots of animals in the industry (chicken, cow, mink etc) don’t get that."

trashy,fehr0tj,t1_fehpo3x,1579122155.0,"She was fucking loaded up and trying to white knuckle it through her bit. You can see it in her eyes when she says “first gurest” she knew she was slipping, and she was obviously coming across as impaired. So she faked passing out so she had cover."

politics,fdipazb,t3_elku7e,1578448003.0,Does anyone know what if any protests are planned?
dogswithjobs,fcuqap4,t1_fcungdz,1577986338.0,Sure seems that lots of people feel that way. Probably the same people I keep seeing in airports who can hardly control their dogs.
dogswithjobs,fcui1ki,t1_fcuh2o0,1577981449.0,"No vest and it’s up on a seat which I’ve never seen with an actual service dog. So I along with everyone else assume that it’s an ESA which I could give two shits about. Plenty of people bring pets on planes now and claim it’s an emotional service animal without it actually being one. 

Also people can  dislike dogs, be very much afraid of dogs (after a traumatic incident like a dog attack), or be allergic. All of which are valid reasons to not want dogs on a plane. Especially since they are paying good money to be on the plane too.

But please keep bringing up how the only people who try to bring dogs on a plane are rape victims and the mentally handicapped and anyone who dislikes sitting next to said dog hates rape victims. It’s a good look for you."
dogswithjobs,fcufqgf,t1_fcu704i,1577979873.0,Kinda like a person who can’t fly without a dog present? That kinda seems like some basic buttered toast shit huh?
dogswithjobs,fcufh00,t1_fctyap8,1577979686.0,Or like my dads wife who was mauled by 2 dogs as a child and left with a horrible fear of dogs. She’d hate this.
40kLore,fcsg4h8,t1_fcsf7ue,1577916034.0,"As long as they post actual lore and not TTS or other meme lore then it’s all good. Though I do recognize not everyone gets the same thing from a lore sub, but for me I like a good “serious” discussion."
40kLore,fcsexqa,t1_fcs0w1k,1577915570.0,"Cmon man you’re free to disagree but don’t call OP names, that’s bullshit. This is a 40klore sub that’s got no place here. OP can post their opinion without name calling  even if you disagree with what they are saying."
40kLore,fcse5n8,t1_fcqkpsz,1577915262.0,"I mean some of them post headcannon and meme lore as fact, which is the biggest issue this sub faces imho. Angron ads a lot but the Angron op has figured out how to do it right. Others not so much."
40kLore,fcsdcxe,t1_fcrmpdh,1577914960.0,"Dude honestly you’re the only one that does it right, and the only one who I think adds to the discussion. The rest just post head cannon and meme lore, but all while maintaining the same kind of low quality RP tone that drove me off of 40k forums in  the mid 2000s."
40kLore,fcscwwx,t3_eihao9,1577914781.0,Agreed. Same with the accounts that post as though they are in universe. This is a lore sub not a role playing sub
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fch5sv9,t1_fcgkvs6,1577647549.0,"I totally see what your saying and my point wasn’t so much that body armor makes them invincible so much as it is just yet another think stacked against us. 

I’ve tried my fathers 357 and I like it I just have a fairly narrow frame and so it makes it harder to be inconspicuous. I don’t carry currently because of the state I’m living in at the moment so it’s not a huge deal."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fcgjkjd,t1_fcgei21,1577640859.0,Well if we are talking about carrying for self defense Im a small person so it’s 9mm. Which body armor should at least have a decent shot at stopping. My whole point was that you are not gonna stop the issue or police corruption and unjustified police violence with guns. You’ll just give them an excuse to militarize further. Again I say all of this as someone who is very much pro 2A.
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fcg3bwk,t1_fcfuk1s,1577636127.0,"I mean I’m a gun guy and pro 2A but if you really want to give cops a reason to gun your ass down carry a gun. Look at Philando Castile. If we want it to change we need protests in front of the worst police dept headquarters. 

Plus they have body armor, I don’t, in this situation it’s in no way an equalizer."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcal01e,t1_fcag6nf,1577571287.0,"Straight up. 

I hate this mentality. Just because some people like some cop they know it makes up for the fact that civilians are killed by the police at an alarming rate and are then defended by other cops. Fucking nonsense, hold these pieces of shit accountable."
TopMindsOfReddit,fc8xqdv,t1_fc8tpiu,1577543768.0,"Well like half died freeing you, the other half died for some other reason."
TopMindsOfReddit,fc8xd5j,t1_fc8qjq2,1577543592.0,Don’t bother he’s a brain dead fucking Nazi.
