unpopularopinion,ff79eqq,t1_ff77v7v,1579643804.0,"Allah does approve the killing of people who engage in homosexual relations, says the book. In Verse 80-84 of Book 7 of the Quran, for example, Allah declares that ‚ÄúFor ye practise your lusts on men in preference to women : ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds ‚Ä¶ [In Sodom and Gomorrah] we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): Then see what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime!‚Äù

So does Mohammad, Islam‚Äôs reputed prophet, who is deemed the perfect model for all Muslims to copy, according to orthodox Islamic ideology. His recorded statements are written up as the Hadiths, where he is shown as urging the death of homosexuals. For example, a collection of sayings by Abu Dawud records one tale ‚ÄúNarrated By Abdullah ibn Abbas : The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If you find anyone doing as Lot‚Äôs people did, kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done.‚Äù

Islam is a very rule-bound religion, complete with a formal process for adjudicating crimes. So it discourages vigilante action and centralizes law-enforcement and theology under the power of Imams. Homosexuals are punished via a formal legal process that sometimes ends with the victim being thrown off a cliff or a building.

""Overall, the empirical case against spanking is strong, and made stronger by the absence of any empirical case in support of spanking. There is not one well designed study I have seen that links spanking to long term positive outcome.

This convergence of empirical results on the negative effects of spanking should not surprise those versed in developmental theory. One would be hard pressed to find any theoretical framework addressing itself to child development from which positive predictions about the effects of spanking can be drawn. Developmental theory by and large would predict that spanking effects, to the extent they are found, will indeed be negative.""

Edit: 

The Firefall

In the summer of 1872, the owners of Glacier Point Hotel in Yosemite Valley started a near-century long tradition of tossing burning embers off the top of Glacier Point. As the embers fell nearly 3,000 feet to the valley floor below‚Äîand from a distance‚Äîthey appeared as a glowing waterfall. The fall of fire attracted visitors from across the nation and quickly became a tourist attraction. However, in January of 1968, the National Park Service terminated the practice.

Nature‚Äôs Firefall

Each February, thousands of tourists flock to Yosemite to witness the return of the Firefall, but this one occurs naturally. For a brief two-week window, the last fleeting rays of sunset fall perfectly upon Horsetail Fall, located on the east side of El Capitan. The sunlight ignites the fall in a vibrant red and orange glow, reminiscent of the original Firefall. The colors are so impressive that the waterfall appears to be on fire as the rest of the valley fades into darkness. Although the timeframe in which the event occurs is quite easy to predict, actually witnessing it involves various natural elements coming together in perfect unison.

How does the Firefall happen?

It takes four key ingredients to cooperate perfectly prior to sunset for the Firefall to come to life. The first is that the Yosemite Valley needs to have received a decent amount of snowfall throughout the winter. This snowfall provides the water necessary to create Horsetail Fall, which is fed directly by snowmelt. Next, during the last two weeks of February when the sun perfectly aligns, temperatures must be above freezing to help with the melting of the snow. If temperatures remain below freezing, any small amount of water flowing will simply freeze and the fall will remain dry. Even with water flowing, the clouds need to cooperate as well. The Firefall typically occurs within the last 10-15 minutes prior to sunset, so light needs to be able to come into the valley. And, even with a small cloud in the western sky, the event could be a dud. Finally, if strong winds are prevalent, the little bit of water that is falling can be sprayed away, resulting in a glowing mist, and not a distinct waterfall."

YangForPresidentHQ,fdbvzeu,t1_fdbtnru,1578262728.0,"Tbh I don't go into the topics I know are sensitive, like abortion or trans people - really has nothing to do with the lives of the people I'm speaking to. Once I tell people I'm unhappy with the current state of things, they tend to soften. Next I butter them up by explaining how Yang isn't a politician, like Trump wasn't, but that he's got some insane ideas that he somehow has figured out. I find out what's important to them and typically have no trouble pulling from one of Yang'ed stances'. They seem to understand ubi isn't communism when you explain how it's paid for. Ain't no one happy with the current state of things, believe that. Also I always add in that I've never been involved in a campaign before now and why I think he's the right guy for the job. I've had manyy people quietly listen and seem to absorb what I'm saying, even if they don't commit or give me their email. 

Srsly, the more human you seem, the better. Pro-tip: if you stutter or sigh or clear your throat as you start to give your intro - people are WAY more likely to let you finish. Makes it harder if they're certain you're not a robot or recording, to hang up. Weird but it works lol. Nothing big, stay subtle. 

Think of some of Yang's policies that religious people would like, like child care, his family, getting big bureaucratic government out, etc."
