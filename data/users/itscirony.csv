UKPersonalFinance,ffl33nl,t1_ffl2b58,1580033915.0,"OP doesn't say where they are. For most of the UK this would only get them a small flat which isn't worthwhile at this point. It's true that they may need to move around a lot and won't find a place to settle for several years. If a house is the aim it's best to wait, find out where they want to buy and then use it as a significant deposit.

But with other major costs upcoming, uni, driving lessons, car etc, it may be best to use it for self investment. Or even just as a big safety net for the often very difficult jump from uni to employment."

facepalm,femxa6e,t1_femx4nt,1579272010.0,Yeah ok I thought I was in the wrong sub - in the UK it's rarely offered. But you're right (I assume) that many other countries would offer it routinely.
facepalm,femwu3w,t1_femprzl,1579271686.0,"The vaccine is rarely offered, it's generally only given to people at risk, so many parents still resort to chicken pox parties. You can see the standard vaccine schedule here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/nhs-vaccinations-and-when-to-have-them/"

And chicken pox in adults is horrible and far more likely to cause long term damage compared to chicken pox in children. It generally lasts longer (had an adult in the office who caught it and was out for an entire month) and often leads to shingles which is essentially chronic pain.

unitedkingdom,fecyfp3,t1_fea6hz3,1578989796.0,"I went on benefits when I left uni, job seekers and child tax credits (I had a kid and a wife still studying, which actually helped out as the rules at the time then meant we could both claim) in London, I had some savings as well but really not much.

Spent the first 8 months or so volunteering at a place I wanted to work. I applied for a real job a couple times in that industry but got rejected both times (and the group I was volunteering with had no money to actually hire anyone). So eventually I went back to the grad market with what was almost a years worth of experience and ended up getting a job that was tangentially related. After a year of that I took another grad job in a field I actually wanted to work in and have been happy ever since.

We had to take benefits for two years in the end and it was a bloody nightmare. We were living hand to mouth the entire time. Job seekers was awful - complete disregard for the volunteering work I was doing and would fine me if I didn't apply to several jobs every week (with evidence). Juggling the actual work I was trying to do and looking after my child was almost impossible when also looking for work that paid.

And at the end of it, because of the way benefits are calculated, once I had a job that could actually support me HMRC handed me a bill for several thousand £ at Christmas.

All that said I am grateful that the welfare state allowed my family to survive until we found work.

And all that said, I'm fairly sure the rules have changed now to the point that this isn't possible anymore. But worth checking out.

I'm not trying to say that this is an out for you, I'm just trying to point out that in the recent past (this was less than 10 years ago) it wasn't necessarily rich parents who helped you through. Might not be the case nowadays."
ukpolitics,fbw6lxf,t1_fbvq78u,1577142129.0,"Yep, my wife is a junior at the moment and has heard about some practices when applying for a consultancy post (e.g. inviting the head of a department out for lunch to talk about ""life"" pre interview etc, i.e. stuff you can't talk about in an interview legally). That definitely feels like something that needs to be looked at."
