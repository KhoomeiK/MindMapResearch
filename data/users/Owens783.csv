The lack of self awareness is glaring. Read my comments. I never once said \*calling\* them American Buffalo was wrong. Ever. In fact if you'd bother to look I said the EXACT OPPOSITE and then went on to explain that while its NOT incorrect to call them American Buffalo they are in fact not buffalo. Hence the binomial nomenclature bit. I bring up Wyoming because Bison actually roam Wyoming making it pertinent as those would be people referring to and talking about Bison regularly. My first comment was literally one word: bison, and your fucking head exploded and you took it as some personal affront. Get over yourself.

Right because there's no way that could possibly have been a typo, but go ahead and pat your back for it I guess. I guess I can get your for ""I couldn't \*call\* less..."" Do I automatically win now? Also your point was stupid, typo or no typo.

\>Your point being what?

My point was pretty obvious. You go on a tirade about how no one uses the scientific names for animals yet you very ironically chose to mention yet another animal people call by their scientific name. Furthermore with the whole Sea World business and ""Blackfish"" being a thing I'd wager Orca is more common a name than killer whale at this point.

You say I'm trying to argue an ""idiotically pedantic point"" while i literally said one word and you can't even see how everything you're saying about me directly applies to yourself.

Considering the political hackery that went into “impeaching” him anyone with 2 brain cells knows it doesn’t mean anything. The republican president was impeached by an all democrat house the likes of which literally formed a “resistance” movement and tried their little hearts out to make his presidency illegitimate.

I’ll leave it at there’s plenty of time within the gestation-abortion window for the nervous system to develop enough to allow the sensation of pain. That said, Having a child in no reasonable way causes suffering to the mother. Humans have been doing it for the last 125,000 years. Its not a legitimate argument to claim that your actions leading to your pregnancy and ultimate discomfort give you the right to end that discomfort by killing another human. It’s obviously not a parasite since it doesn’t use the body’s nutrients to the detriment of the “host”. It’s pregnancy. Comparing it to a parasite is stupid. Biological material does in fact contain a special “life force”. The bacteria you mentioned, the zygote, the fetus they’re all composed of one or more cells. And what are cells? Well according to the basic biology definition of a cell it is the fundamental unit of LIFE. You can be as reductionist as you want about it but the science exists and you don’t get to choose which science you believe and which science you don’t. To say there’s nothing special about life is just silly. Look around you. You like the technology you’re using to even have this conversation? You like modern medicine? You like clean water? I guess not since “there’s nothing special about life.” 

Now let’s move on to that doozy of a kidney hypothetical. You, the person in need of my kidney, would be the fetus in this case, right? Welp first of all it’s already illegal to harvest organs against a persons will but let’s take your argument and your asinine hypothetical to it’s logical conclusion. You need my kidney? You’re “the fetus” in this instance. Do I get to kill you because you need my kidney and I don’t feel like giving it to you? Do I get to actively murder you? Obviously since Homo sapiens have existed for 125,000 years pregnancy in no statistically significant way puts the life of the mother below that of the fetus. And you’re right:

> having sex is not an argument for taking people’s basic rights away 

That’s exactly right. Having sex definitely does not give you the right to stop a human being of their basic right to live and not be killed. By the way,  saying that not letting someone kill an unborn human is putting the rights of the fetus above those of the mothers is literally the same argument as saying not letting a murderer kill his victim is the same thing as putting the  rights of the victim above those of the murderer. It’s amazing how you can say all of that without that little bit of self awareness."
Cringetopia,fdtjd7o,t1_fdtekqu,1578717598.0,You consented to having sex. The gamble you make when having sex is pregnancy every time. Excluding people missing the required equipment. Your choice to engage in an act whose sole purpose is procreation is hardly the fault of the life your actions created and you viewing the results of your actions as an inconvenience is hardly any excuse for killing it.
Cringetopia,fdtibk7,t1_fdtekqu,1578717166.0,"It is morally wrong to actively and knowingly take the life of an innocent human being. How can killing something regardless of sentience not be harm?? You talk about bodily autonomy while conveniently forgetting that you are ending the life of another human being who gets no say in the matter. You can’t kill something that isn’t alive so your “thought experiment” fails on its face. If a woman engages in sex and then gets pregnant I really fail to see how her not wanting to have the child gives her free reign to kill the fetus... if her grandmother went into a coma that she was definitely going to wake up from in 9 months would she have the right to murder her grandmother because she doesn’t feel like taking care of her? 

> If a conception happen and the woman does not want it, she is in her right to terminate if she has equal rights to everyone else

The expression of her equal rights is that she doesn’t have a right to kill anyone for her convenience ever. Nor do you or I. That’s the equity inherent here. If the conception happens and she didn’t want it to, she should have taken steps to prevent it prior to having sex. Anything less certainty isn’t the fetus’ fault. 

I don’t see why you feel the need to bring sentience up at all. If sentience made any difference whatsoever we would have the right to kill any person in a vegetative or comatose state. It’s completely asinine. Do you believe it’s okay to kill a five week old puppy just because your dog got pregnant but you didn’t consent to taking care of it’s litter? It’s not sentient. Can’t survive on its own. And it’s eyes aren’t even open. But I bet for some inane reason you’d be more against killing the puppy than you would be about killing a child. 

>Why do I think it’s morally wrong to kill a fetus?

What kind of question is that? It’s the killing of the literal definition of an innocent life. Just like the puppy. It has done nothing wrong, was brought into the world by the actions of someone else and it’s life will be forfeit because mom didn’t use a condom. I mean the question’s almost nonsensical. 

>Do I apply the same reason to ALL organisms on earth?

 No and I don’t have to. Not all organisms are created equal. I kill insects and I eat meat. I love my dog and treat her well and I’ll pet a cat if I see one. But they don’t have the same impact as a human being. There’s plenty of laws on the books about the treatment of vertebrate animals at least. It’s illegal for me to starve my dog to death because I didn’t feel like taking care of it anymore or throw a cat into a river because I felt like it yet somehow if you really don’t feel like having a baby, you can just kill it.

Right, which is exactly why you don’t get to kill the fetus just because you didn’t feel like going on the pill or wearing a condom. 

Not killing a fetus is not a special right. You don’t have a right to kill anyone. Ever. 

Which rights specifically will they lose outside of the womb? What rights do fetuses have within the womb that they lose when they’re out? Because what you’re arguing is so long as they’re in the womb they have the right to be killed at the whim of their mother
