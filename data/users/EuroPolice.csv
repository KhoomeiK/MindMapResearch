I think that doesn't really indicate depression, I mean if it does I've been having it since about 2 years.

Depression IMO is that feeling of impeding doom that takes away the ""meaning and reason"" of everything. Then it just doesn't makes sense to do it, and takes away your capacity to feel, because then everything you do, everything you say, everything you see and feel will be in vain.

 I had that feeling in the past, but now I try to focus in miniscule things that normally goes unnoticed; That bird, that each morning, each afternoon goes to my window flowers to eat the seeds is the reason I keep putting seeds,  also the reason to keep that otherwise useless plant but most importantly, the reason to wake up. I think making someone/something else happy helps.

But I don't think I'm depressed now, I try to improve things so I guess I'm normal(?)."
