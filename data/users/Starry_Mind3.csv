With that being said, I have no sympathy for your situation. You called him immature and childish for playing with a top when others plays with fidget spinners or magnets, but you quit your job for this reason. Yeah, good luck. I think that guy no longer has an ableist bully to worry about.

CasualConversation,fd9lzt7,t3_ek9gaz,1578235191.0,To say I think about it constantly is an understatement. I dream about it. I crave the idea of going back and starting fresh. Things were so much simpler. I actually had friends back then. Friends who were not judgmental with my secrets. Friends who liked me for me. People I cared about would still be alive. People I don’t know anymore wouldn’t have screwed up their lives yet. I want nothing more than to go back. Be a kid again.

DoesAnybodyElse,fcz31qn,t1_fcz2lqu,1578092655.0,"Slowly, I have. I started to limiting my exposure to social media; when you stop comparing yourself to the false sense of happiness others seem to have, you acknowledge that you are not perfect and will never achieve the picture of happiness that’s on social media. Happiness comes from within, and it is humble. I started meditating, changed what I ate and drank, started going for more walks, set aside one day to focus on personal projects and hobbies, and read more. 

It doesn’t defeat the depression completely, it just gives me brighter days to look forward to when it’s the darkest. 

Also, another key is to let yourself go low. Don’t fight it, don’t give in, but accept that you are human and a being that has negativity. The secret is to let yourself acknowledge that, then bounce back."
