So he says the coops will get loans from the government to start the companies. I assume there will be some sort of judgement system in place to decide if the group has a solid business plan, because otherwise taxpayers are paying for people to waste money. So if you have government investing in businesses, won't they expect some level of say in how they are run, to ensure they can pay back their loan? 

Say the government denies a groups bid for a loan, and they don't want to give up. Can they seek funding from a private group of investors? Again, these investors will not be working in the company, but will want a say in how things are run. 

Say a coop of 100 people decides they don't care about polluting a local stream, there will be government regulations still in that sense?

What I'm asking is, getting to that idea would be such a drastic overhaul of our entire economy. To be worth it, you'd expect the end result to be something completely different than what we could achieve with tweaks to what we have now. So if the only real difference is that a group starts the company instead of a single person, why bother?

Illegal immigrants are still people you racist ass bitch."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdjbei2,t1_fdjb96a,1578464164.0,"So it is okay to be racist towards illegal immigrants?

Do you believe most illegal immigrants are drug dealers and rapists, but SOME are good people, as he said?"

Either ignorant or racist or both. You support him you support his racism."

America thinks of itself as the standard that the world looks to, right? So why not set a good example?

Why do these companies get to potentially destroy life for us just to turn a profit for themselves, and we will all have to share in the cost of fixing the problem when we are finally forced to? Why not force the companies causing the majority of the co2 to pay for producing it? 

Just because there are many powerful people who are selfish doesn't mean we just give up and resign ourselves to a shitty fate."

If we are wrong and it isn't a huge worry, some mega corps lose a few bucks. If you are wrong, society is fucked. Mass migrations, flooding, drought. All to save some wealth?"

>If all of the Greenland ice sheet were to melt, global sea level would rise by more than 7 meters. According to the same study, that could potentially happen within 1,000 years.

They are saying even 1 meter of rise will have catastrophic effects. We don't need the whole thing to melt before it causes a a nearly impossible problem to fix. 

Appeal to experts. Not authority. It is what we have to do all the time because not a single person can know all there is to know. Like you say even the experts can be wrong sometimes, and they are the ones spending the most time doing the research. So if they can be wrong, imagine how wrong you can be who does a tiny fraction of the research they do."
therewasanattempt,fddaa9v,t1_fdd9y9s,1578302258.0,"If the experts say the amount that is melting is worth worrying about, that is worth listening to. So what if it will take 300 more years for it to completely melt, is that what it will take for you to start worrying? When the ice is completely gone?

 If the experts say it is time to worry, why not listen? Do you really think you know more than the people who study this day in and day out?"
