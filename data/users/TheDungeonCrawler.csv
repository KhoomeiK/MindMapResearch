If you're just running a small engine in the side to give your going first deck some going second options, this is adequate but any deck with any real focus on Shaddolls as a part of their primary engine is going to want to run 1 or 2 Squa and Hedge, 1 Falco for grindy games, and at least 2 El Shaddoll Fusion since the deck's biggest thing when it came out was tagging into Construct to dodge effects and it can do it again because Construct is at 3 now."

yugioh,ff3ny3t,t1_ff3imt2,1579545106.0,"So, Ancient Gears wouldn't be that expensive if they didn't use Urgent Schedule because, while Ancient Gear Fusion is really good, it's also not necessary for the deck to compete at a rogue level. But Urgent Schedule is like $30 to $40 right now."

I get that it being invisible was an important part of that metaphor as well, but the problem was that it just made the action scenes in the epiaode look really cheesy/bad. I think what they did with the perceived entities in Knock (Clara and Capaldi) would have served the monster much more effectively. Basically, the action should have been heavily toned down and maybe the monster itself should have been swapped for somethjng else. Something that caused dread in Van Gough, but didn't need to be physically fought, but removed. The Vashta Nerada are a good example of that."

A big way this happens is when there are certain conventions concerning the art medium and people disparage it for breaking the rules. Successful artists of all times in history have claimed that art has no rules, and they're right, but the grim reality is that they are often appreciated in their time because they followed the rules to a T. If you want to be successful, the best course of action is to follow the rules. If you want to be remembered, boldly break them. You may not ever feel the effects, but history might."

Yugioh101,feyzwhl,t3_eqkev8,1579452541.0,"I've only been to two major events, and the recent one was the one where I'd even seen a judge called so I'll just talk about the bad ruling he gave my friend.

My friend summoned Ahrima, Warden of the Wicked while Lair of Darkness was up. He was playing against Unchained. He gave her opportunity to chain to the summon, as Ahrima is not a quivk effect. She decided not to so he activated Ahrima's effect, tributed her monster for cost to initiate the chain but she wanted to chain her monster's effect. Well, you can't do that because that monster has already been tributed and its effect can only be chained on the field. Judge ruled in her favor however, which made no sense to an onlooker. It didn't cost him the game, but try to keep in mind the details of the situation because he might've thought that she was chaining to the summon, not the activation.

As for my own story, we didn't call the judge on this but I'm certain that, had I noticed what was happening she would've. She had IP and another Link 2. She was comboing off and I decided to drop Nibiru. She chained IP's effect to summon Apollousa. She then activated Apollousa's effect on summon to negate Nibiru's effect. That's simply not how chains work. IP would resolve summoning Apollousa, Nibiru would resolve tributing everything, and Apollousa would be gone before it even had a change in its attack value. I bring this up because myself, my opponent, and my friend standing right behind me didn't notice that this was happening. I don't know how the judge would have ruled in this case, but you never know."

I'm not saying it's impossible though. It depends on where she's from because a shitty judge could absolutely give a 21 year old serial sexual abuser that much leniency.
