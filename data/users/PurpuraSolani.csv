I'm in QLD and I've sadly only ever found Pedro's in enthusiasts yards."
todayilearned,ff2j0qc,t1_ff2ij3z,1579508304.0,"I mean everybody has a vice, for some people smoking is the easiest option.

I don't drink because I have a personal problem with alcohol, whenever I try and stay sober from other drugs my nicotine usage massively spikes.

It's also not possible to have a beer, or smoke some weed at work to ease your nerves, but smoke breaks are almost ubiquitously allowed."
todayilearned,ff2ixn2,t1_ff2i7z6,1579508187.0,"Most homeless folks walk around picking up ciggie butts.

Dumpers or bumpers they're called. Often there's a surprising amount of tobacco left inside. However it's definitely fuck tons worse for you. I got sick quite often doing that."
todayilearned,ff2ipsg,t1_ff2h53u,1579507899.0,"Well, I have ADHD and I also have rather poor visualisation abilities too.

While I am still largely a visual learner, I need to use my actual eyes rather than my mind's eye. I can still image things in my head every now and again, but it's very difficult to do and it requires immense concentration. Probably why I love diagrams so much instead of verbal or written directions.

With your example of throwing a ball, as a kid I guess I just picked one up and threw it. I'm pretty good at throwing things into other things from distance, like rubbish into the bin or etc, but that's always almost entirely just muscle memory from try and error or straight up luck."

cacti,fewnojk,t1_fewk2x8,1579415993.0,"That's what caused it in the first place.

When I got this plant it was severely etiolated and had a rather bad case of sunburn. I ended up cutting the bastard to just below half it's original height.

Kept it nice and dry, the top portion has now almost completely rotted away, and the bottom portion was doing okay for a time, but it now appears to have made a resurgence.

Cheers lol, genuinely thought it was a cacti."

cacti,few853v,t3_eqrjc8,1579406743.0,"Also I suspect that the top is suffering from rot. I don't know how this happened though, as I cut it like every other succulent I've cared for."

trees,fevk6oe,t1_feuss0t,1579398346.0,"I grabbed like a fat wad of the blackest tarry resin I had ever seen, me and my mate decided because we had no weed we would attempt to find ANY THC in the house and consume it.

Luckily we had a bottle of acetone, dissolved the res wad in that shit, filtered it with coffee filters a few times. Then we evaporated the acetone.

Got left with some surprisingly green reclaim, albeit not much. Perhaps like a 10th or a 15th of the volume we initially had.

Dabbed it onto a meth pipe and actually got a nice little buzz to put me to sleep."

Blazed, or not blazed?"
grinders,femq19o,t3_epsvsf,1579266215.0,"Bro that's absolutely just scuffing.

What exactly would be in the scuffing that is bad for you? More metal? More paint? Weed?

Chill, you didn't need to buy a new chamber at all.


Also yeah wrong sub lol :P"
Psychonaut,fem4mnf,t1_feliwq6,1579239600.0,"Anti depressants aren't intoxicating.
Pain killers are mildly impairing when taken as prescribed, less impairing than severe pain anyway.

As a *daily* pot smoker, weed is a marvelous intoxicant. If I get high before work I notice a rather pronounced change in my ability to work on task and with time in mind. I notice myself kick up a few gears when the weed starts to wear off.

I love cannabis, but it needs to be used responsibly, like all drugs. There is a time and place, and your work is not that place."
