No doubt, surgeons can skillfully cut things out of you when they correctly use equipment designed by engineers.  Sometimes chemical scientists/engineers have discovered some impressive drugs like vaccines and antibiotics.  Occasionally doctors use these correctly.

People love to defend the idea of doctors with the lifesaver hyperbole because they have such limited experience.   Once they personally experience the reality of the healthcare industry, they get quiet though.

Doctors probably start with good intentions.  With their pharmaceutical toolbox, they're definitely effective at providing temporary symptom relief for minor issues while the patient's own body fixes itself.   As medical issues get more complex though, they're quickly batting out of their league, but don't admit it and feel entitled to their inflated and protected pay.

Friend had non-cosmetic surgery inside her nose so she could breath out the left nostril.  They left some packing in there and now she can barely see and walk.  ""Well she's just unlucky"".  Actually this is not uncommon.  ""Well she knew the odds"".  She didn't.  Doctor said it was extremely low risk and the worst case symptom was the feeling of a dry nose.  Operation was actually not required.  Doctor made $23k that day.

Doctor induced labor prematurely and my niece was born way too early.  Was in the NICU for months and my sister was left with >$90k of bills.  Niece now has numerous medical issues.  

The side of my boss's face felt numb so he went to a neurologist who prescribed a drug.  Side-effect was violent facial spasms.  Doctor doubled the dose.  Spasms got worse, doctor doubled dose again.  Permanent loss of feeling in left side of upper body now.  Next doctor tried different medicine and resulted in Stevens-Johnson syndrome which resulted in what was effectively 3rd degree burns over most of his body and 100% loss of hair and permanent disfigurement of skin.  

Wife had a sharp pain in leg every time she ran.  Doctors said it was degenerative disk so they sent her to therapy.  One month of therapy ($600 out of pocket) with no results other than a sore back, which she didn't have before.  Went back to doctor and they sent her for a bunch of tests ($2k out of pocket) and another month of therapy.  Back continued to get worse.  Third visit, doctor said the tests show she has a form of arthritis and she shouldn't have been doing those exercises in therapy.  He prescribed pain killers and muscle relaxers.  Went downhill from there.

Family friend was diagnosed with Crohn's disease ten years ago... except none of the medicine worked, so they  changed the diagnosis a few times.  Each time, new drugs and new side-effects, no results.  They even had to remove sections of intestine (result of side-effect). They were using high risk drugs to troubleshoot the problem.

Father dying quickly, but relatively painless and he still had all mental faculties.  Doctor says there's a 1 in x chance this procedure will give your father ten more years with the only side effect of possible death during operation.  Procedure fails and he's lost most mental faculties.  Screams in pain 8 hours a day.   He stays this way for nearly a year.  

Coworker went in for hip pain.  Doctor said he could fix it with 'resurfacing'.  Coworker never agreed to a new hip and the doctor said it wasn't needed.  Scoffed at the idea.  Coworker went to sleep and woke up with a new hip.  Doctor said ""well, we couldn't save the hip and this was the only option"".  He's 35 and has the mobility of an 80 year old.  The hip will need replaced in 10 to 15 years, he MIGHT be able to get a second, but never a third.

To this day, 30% of the pictures in her house are of people she doesn't know.

We started replacing them with our own pictures, but she said they looked ugly and replaced them with cutouts from her magazines.

TheAmpHour,fcadaed,t3_egry7x,1577567228.0,"Here's an idea to try:

Attach the camera board to an x/y screw.  Then take multiple pictures at 1/8th pixel pitch offsets.  Composite these images for an image with 64x resolution.

Here's something a little more involved, but makes the camera more usable.

Secure a pager vibrating motor to the sensor board such that the motor's axis is parallel with the light.  You can do this by simply adding a plated through hole that's slightly larger than the pager motor's diameter.  Then insert the motor shell into the PTH and solder it.

Next mount the sensor board with rubber grommets so the board can slightly move on the same plane roughly one or two pixel pitches when the motor is on.

Add a photoeye aimed at the motor's counterweight that sends a sync pulse each rotation.

This will allow you to take multiple pictures each rotation and create a higher resolution composite.

Even if the motor speed is fast and individual pixel capture slow, as long as the timing is right, the resolution will be much better."

electronic_circuits,fc9yhik,t1_fc0n5w0,1577560100.0,"There are several varieties and techniques.  

1. In old machines, the leverage and grip angle could be changed by changing where each claw pivots.  There are typically three different holes.  The instructions say this is for different sized toys, but this is a known lie as changing the pivot doesn't allow it to open larger.
2. The force was also adjustable with a screw that tentioned a spring.  
3. Players spend more money when they feel like they almost got it.  So in the late 70s, the claw force would be weakened as soon as it got to the top.  This way it would drop the price before it got to the drop point.
4. Since proprietors and some states don't like to gamble with their revenue, modern machines are setup with defined win rates.  So they basically just drop the prize X our of Y times.  It's a static rate on most machines, so if you work near a claw machine, you can actually tell when it will win next.  The ones with expensive (cell phones and jewelry) prizes are more intelligent though."
