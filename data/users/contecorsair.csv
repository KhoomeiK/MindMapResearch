Its probably just temporary. I've seen stores close the whole cold isle and have to dump everything because of this happening though, so this is great."

todayilearned,felc95i,t1_fel9sbd,1579218790.0,I'm not a donor. I'm okay with not being eligible for a transplant though. I'd rather just die without too much medical intervention when my body starts failing. Plus I never go to the doctor and I probably have a myriad of undiagnosed health issues I wouldn't want someone else to inherit.

They'll expose themselves a bit or try to touch and hug me if the conversation goes on too long."

Solasmancers,fdsbda0,t3_emw5uq,1578698705.0,I had Cole and Solas as companions the entire game and rotated out the 3rd companion only. I romanced Solas and had no idea what was going to happen in Trespasser. I heard every hint and didn't suspect a thing. I finished it sobbing and having flashbacks of all the little things Cole had said. They writers hid it so well yet dropped hints in nearly every interaction.
funny,fdoq817,t1_fdogiyl,1578610407.0,"I have the skills to craft something comparable or even better on my own. It's difficult to find a bra that works with inserts, in particular just one on one side and a boob on the other. The weight distribution isn't right so the insert slides around especially while trying exercise. I often just go to Target or something with 10+ bras trying them on trying to find one that works by random chance, often I just don't find anything, wearing the same bra I found years ago every day until it's nothing but stained threads. I need someone or someplace with experience fitting bras and having bras that are made with the concept of inserts in mind, or a very practical and realistic insert that will make up for the impracticalities of stuffing. Also, to be frank, if one of those knitted donut-looking things fell out of my bra in the middle of sexy time I feel like I would just be laughed at. I need a bra that fits and supports the  left and right side and has a pocket that fits the insert so it doesn't slide around and stays in place and preferably comes off in one piece without the insert falling out."
funny,fdmmo5l,t1_fdmm35k,1578555820.0,"I never had cancer... Just a congenital defect. Since its congenital (thus ""aesthetic"") my insurance doesn't cover a realistic insert (I use a piece of foam) and I can't find bras that work for me. I'm in CA. Mastectomy products sort of work but still aren't ideal."

aww,fcv6v4i,t3_ej39k2,1577995869.0,"This is my girl, Coal. I've had her for 18 years. She broke into our house when I was 11 and ate my goldfish. I wasn't even mad. We've been through so much together. She used to escort me on 2 mile hikes up the mountain behind my house and  down to the bus stop in the morning for school and would be waiting for me to get home. She defended the house against rattlesnakes on two occasions, waking me up and bringing me to the snake but not allowing me to get close to it. She is a badass hunter and taken down prey twice her size (a full grown raven) and used to catch and eat any mouse that came in the house in a matter of minutes. She has arthritis (glucosamine and chondroitin really help her though) and no teeth left (living up to her nickname Toothless). Now she sleeps all day on her favorite blanket next to a floor heater. She knows many phrases and learned to use a litter box at 17 years old (when it became too difficult for her to bury it outside on her own like she had always done). She has never been a lap cat though. A few days ago I fractured three vertebrea (I'll make a full recovery) and for the first time in 18 years she crawled into my lap and fell asleep. I'm scared to breathe, I'm so honored to be loved by this perfect creature."
love,fcsth95,t1_fcs8sc7,1577924686.0,"Agreed. I'm in it right now myself and for the first time I'm fully embracing the infatuation and addiction the other person brings me without being fooled into thinking I'm in love. It's refreshing. From an outsiders perspective they can look similar but the feeling inside is different. It might lead to love (and hopefully it does in OPs case!) but it doesn't sound like love quite yet. Passion is fun though, and it's not a bad thing, but it's such a freeing feeling to finally understand and feel the difference."
aww,fcnv2h5,t1_fcnmgpf,1577819002.0,I've heard of dogs being trained to do this who bark a lot and run around when someone comes home. It gives them a job to do and if you don't want them barking so much it occupies their mouth.

homeless,fcb6ioa,t1_fcb5smv,1577582998.0,"""one thing that sucks about being homeless is a broken zipper"" gee I wonder where I got the idea you were complaining about a broken zipper. I must be off my fucking rocker for coming to that conclusion. You also just posted you are buying a brand new jacket on January 4th... Why even bother. And thanks for correcting me 58° is such a big difference than 60° I'm sure those 2° make such a bone chilling difference."
homeless,fcb3vep,t3_egwyia,1577582008.0,"Is this a troll account? Homeless and you complain about a broken zipper? Fuck I wish the rest of the world had it so good. If only that was all there was to complain about. I broke three vertebrea two days ago and went to the ER for help. They shot me up with Fentanyl and Morphine (after I said I do not not want opiates just a place to sleep and Ibuprofen and Tylenol) and left me on the street in the middle of the night without a wheelchair and too drugged up and in pain to walk. Downvote me for gatekeeping homelessness, fine whatever, but seriously, dude, get some perspective. It's 60° in San Diego right now. You're fine wearing a T-shirt. You have a place to send orders for things you get online apparently. You have the money to order a brand new Columbia jacket. Is this some kind of obnoxious flex?"
