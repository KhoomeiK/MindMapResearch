ShitMomGroupsSay,fenakkv,t3_epbeio,1579280551.0,"I think it is ok that she feels that way.  It's not like it's a terrible thing to be home with your child in the early years.  I would take the chance if I had it, rather than being at work while she says her first word or takes her first steps.  I'd want that experience rather than having a daycare worker tell me about it.  I know it's not an opportunity that everyone can take advantage of but I don't think there is anything wrong with it either."

coasttocoast,fe825bf,t1_fcfsb0e,1578921592.0,"I totally agree.  Won't even listen when Wallach is on anymore.  Also, I find that the shows lately haven't even been sticking to the topic they portray.  I've been stopping shows out of boredom because the guests delve too deeply into their own personal lives and how they got to where they are today without giving much detail on the interesting part. I've been listening to a lot of Art Bell for a few months now, I am probably spoiled."
