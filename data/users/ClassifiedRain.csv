You’re not going to walk around with a Purple Heart because you didn’t earn it.

I either make another smoothie after I work out or (in rare cases) eat a sandwich or something for dinner and call it good.

Those are already established. So wouldn’t it be on the person claiming “She’s a lizard” to show us that she’s indeed a reptile because there’s already evidence that she’s not? They’re not the first person to make *a* claim but they’re the first person to make *that* claim. So they have to prove it. Right?

BrandNewSentence,fe37vk4,t1_fe1ey0l,1578846809.0,"Our court of law works just like that, does it not? Like I said to the other person, if you’re alleging something happened or didn’t happen, like stealing or not paying back a loan, you have to prove it to the judge. If you can’t, in the eyes of the law whatever you’re complaining about either did or didn’t happen depending on what the allegation was because you can’t back it up, meaning whatever you’re alleging legally didn’t happen (to the judge), which would then validate the defendant’s side of the story whether they were lying their ass off on the other side of the courtroom or the plaintiff just had a terrible testimony or didn’t come prepared with damning evidence, whether verbal or physical. 

The reason those claims don’t work is because the facts are already established that the Queen is human, there’s only one Paul McCartney, entertainment media keeps close tabs on Jennifer Lawrence, and NASA has shown the earth is rounded already. So therefore it’s on you to prove them wrong because they’ve already proven their points. Now if no one knew what species the Queen was, if we’d never been to space or had circumnavigation happen, if somehow there was cloning technology back when McCartney was born, and if the paparazzi never kept up with JLaw, then you could say those things because they hadn’t (at the time) been disproven yet. You’re directly contradicting established claims, so it’s on you to show why their proof is wrong. Scientists do it all the time.

If the initial belief the world over was that the earth is flat, and I went “No way, it’s round,” and used NASA as a scholarly source, then I’ve pulled out the proof to disprove your claim. Just because a claim is false doesn’t mean it can be easily disproven, like the teakettle paradox (I think that’s what it’s called) where someone can say there’s a teakettle in space floating around right now, and technically because we can’t get up there to go check that, it’s a claim that can stay not debunked (sorry if there’s an actual word for it, it got away from me) and thus no one would ever know."

I have a couple questions if that’s okay, but if you don’t have the time/energy to answer that’s alright. 

1. How long is a honeymoon period? 

This is the longest relationship I’ve ever been in, and I thought the very beginning was that super great, checking up really often, never wanting to put the phone down sort of thing. We did this so much. Then it tapered off into what we were both comfortable with. Sometimes we go anywhere from 1-7 days without contact because he prefers to pull away during a depressive episode, and mental health is so important to me that it doesn’t make me upset at all when he does so. We’ve discussed it. It’s only hard for me when I’m going through my own bouts, because I prefer closeness during those times. Unfortunately I believe those bouts are becoming more common (thus overlapping with his) and I live in a conservative college town that has older residents that refuse to fund any sort of upgrades to the healthcare out here that would make therapy accessible outside of school (our “clinic” is actually under investigation for improperly treating some students and not treating others at all). 

2. (I’m naïve, sorry for asking this) What exactly would be the enabling here? Asking for the postcard and him saying yes? If it’s about my grades, how would him paying attention to them be enabling me? Partners are supposed to be supportive, that seems like just being supportive to me. 

Thank you for your time, again. This sub makes me feel less lonely and like I have people who understand what’s going on, uncrossing the wires and helping me make sense of everything."

He said he doesn’t like this job and hates the long hours. Problem is, he couldn’t afford school and had to drop out to just work full-time, and still owes said school money. We spoke previously about this and he said he hoped to find something else, and as soon as he can take whatever new position that may be. I was trying to be optimistic with that one, which is why I entertained the marriage conversation. You said to look ahead (and the way you said it is really, really nice) and so I’m hoping I’m doing it right by being positive about him one day working less.

Also, thank you for taking time out for this."

unpopularopinion,fdgzvv6,t1_fdgz5hq,1578412312.0,"Because ethnicity is an integral part of who people are? Why wouldn’t we want it? That’s not an “obsession.” In the US, Afro-descended people really don’t know where we’re from as a whole, and that’s what invites this “You can’t be a true African” attitude from mainlanders who never left. How would anyone in the situation our forefathers were in be able to trace back DNA to specific regions when they purposely either incorrectly filled in records or destroyed them? Africa is huge, saying “origin: Africa” includes a hell of a lot of land. 

You seem pretty adamant about trying to dictate who someone is or isn’t, so I’ll let it go."
unpopularopinion,fdgyeig,t1_fdgvabb,1578411362.0,"I’m not saying it does make me special, I’m just saying that I’m directly descended from a long line of Afro people. I even have the paperwork from when they brought over my 6th great grandparents, it quite literally says “origin: Africa.” They didn’t put a country but I’m assuming the Gold Coast, we resemble each other. I’m not sure how that doesn’t make me African, I’m definitely that. 

Another thing I’m not seeing is them criticizing Liberia, are they “technically not African” either because it was a bunch of Black people who had been in the US before getting to Africa? Their parents and grandparents and great-grandparents at the least were born on American soil, but they “weren’t African” according to this person’s definition. Curious why that slipped through but the inverse makes us “not African.”"
LongDistance,fdg9v9p,t1_fdg94c9,1578386337.0,"Hi there :)

We’ve been together since 2018, so I feel like I’d just be throwing away all that time. I’ve invested so much into this and don’t feel like I’d have anywhere else to go, we’ve already talked about getting married sometime in the future (it does fly, this last stretch is really getting to me though); once I’m in Texas I feel like I’d do better because we’re closer, I panic when I don’t know where he is (when they send him out of state, when he’s anywhere in Texas I’m the calmest person in the world it seems because that’s what’s normal to me) and I try to keep it internal so I don’t stress him out, but it just leaks and it’s caustic and it makes him react. Nothing has ever been out of pocket/violent, just a snap from him if it’s overwhelming. I feel guilty."
