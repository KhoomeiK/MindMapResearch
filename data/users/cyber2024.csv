instant_regret,ff8fp72,t1_ff7mfr9,1579676460.0,"You're right in that your skin acts as a resistor, but you are wrong about it stopping current. It reduces current.

As an example, I just used a multimeter to test the resistance of my body from one hand to the other and I got about 3.5M Ohms.  This seems really high, but I tested multiple times and areas and got similar readings.

So holding a 12v battery terminal in each hand would yield a 3.4 microamps through my body, including my heart. 

But that would mean a very small voltage drop across my heart, and so no issue. 

With a higher voltage I think your skin will become less resistant and more of the voltage drop will occur within your body rather than across your skin-resistor."

PublicFreakout,ff2ktfh,t1_ff13w88,1579510781.0,"Yep.  
I lived in the gold coast, Australia for quite a while at around 21yo.  
I'm a decent sized lad, but I rarely get angry and I generally have my wits about me. 
My mate used to get kicked out of the pub at the marina (Fishos) all the time mostly for looking drunk and belligerent. 
One time he got kicked out, do we both left, but we made it our mission to sneak back in. We tried over the roof, around the side, and eventually we shimmied under the wharf. Sure we were being silly, but we were having fun, not starting fights or anything like that. 
We made it in for about a minute before 4 bouncers took my mate and I out the other exit, the darker exit with no one around. 
Now, my mate was fucking hammered, but I knew what they were trying to do. So I tell him, let's GTFO now. Meanwhile one bouncer starts popping me in the side of the face. Not particularly hard, he just wanted me to give him a reason.

We ~~hoped~~  noped the fuck out.

The next weekend a guy was killed by the bouncers at that pub."
