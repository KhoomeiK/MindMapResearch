manga,ffk5psn,t3_eu1pdk,1580016724.0,"Translation seems a bit rougher around the edges this time around. Was this the same mech as the one that almost went berserk in the tests, or a different one in the same family?"
anime,ffj0wfc,t1_fficczy,1579987592.0,"Ahh, so that's what people were talking about when they mentioned it'd be explained later why Merlin couldn't allow his projection to be killed/petrified by Gorgon at their first confrontation and hid behind Ritsuka."
houkai3rd,ffgccyb,t3_eth3pr,1579903108.0,Expansion and EXPA are different and have separate pity counters.
houkai3rd,ffet50m,t1_ffesmzh,1579864300.0,"That said, the odds of someone needing to roll all 100 times and hit pity to get the character is 22%, so a little more than 1 in 5 people will need to hit pity. If you think about it like that, that's actually a fairly high chance."
gaming,ffebu4k,t1_ffe54sq,1579842468.0,Except for that one guy in my college dorm lounge who kept yelling PICKLE RICK at random times out of nowhere.
todayilearned,ffdi3c5,t1_ffctdkz,1579821331.0,"I've heard an alternate explanation that suggested the atomic bombs were a convenient way for Japan to save face with its populace considering the imminent Soviet invasion coming from their undefended rear, the bulk of their defenses facing east against American landings."
gachagaming,ffbe9cf,t1_ff9th0k,1579761572.0,"Iirc the game jokes and calls them old women, so it's seemingly implied that they're the original - but genderbent - versions, just using advanced rejuvenation technology to stay young."
todayilearned,ff7iqhe,t1_ff71z8j,1579650496.0,"Reminds of a book I read recently where a pesticide company caused a cancer outbreak in a small county by dumping its waste into the aquifer, and when they were found liable to pay damages, they appealed to the Supreme Court and then bought a seat on the court to push out a moderate and push a conservative in to overturn the damages 5-4."
todayilearned,ff7ifwn,t1_ff6tc9v,1579650297.0,"His conviction is still on the record though it looks like, on the basis that since he was given a posthumous royal pardon, it would be a waste of taxpayer money to wipe his slate clean."
gaming,ff5puvx,t3_erqgmo,1579605266.0,Reminds me of this [Nigel Thornberry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ1dYrjuYf4) rendition.
science,ff2kutw,t1_ff14b9c,1579510836.0,"I tried Coke Life a month or two ago, I wouldn't say it tastes like original Coke, it's more akin to Coke Zero. I haven't had Diet Coke in over a decade so I can't comment on that."
AdviceAnimals,ff2hsbd,t1_ff12udc,1579506712.0,"The older religious people I know don't believe it, they only believe in the fact that he's 'conservative', and therefore not liberal. Almost always boils down to a single-issue topic, usually abortion. 

Honestly seems strange to me abortion or even gayness is such a huge thing for them compared to all the poverty and apathy in the world, like missing the forest for the trees. 

That said, younger religious people I've met are definitely more liberal on average than their older counterparts."
gaming,ff1c3ls,t3_eqzr68,1579477366.0,"I have to say, I was totally expecting a diving joke where the kicker misses the kick and then crumples to the ground like he was just shot."
gaming,ff0zlqm,t3_eqzf81,1579473784.0,"I put the computer to sleep, turn off the light, get in bed.

Then the damn thing turns itself on and starts to update!

I even set the power-on to not accept signals from the internet, only the keyboard..."
gachagaming,fetrzxu,t1_fetnkbg,1579379296.0,"Sure, but do you think many people will roll for 'helmeted knight who goes to the demon club in secret' or 'evil-looking but actually sort of kind demon'?

What's going to be more likely is variations of the 1st (Main 4) and 2nd tier (Wiz, YunYun, Iris, lolicon Nun, etc...) characters.

Edit: For the record, my worries aren't about the initial cast presence, but rather for future banners."
gachagaming,feqp1u7,t3_eqbb5n,1579344452.0,"I feel like a Kirara Fantasia with a much smaller main cast is worrying, but we'll have to see."
gaming,fepmj51,t1_fepke7g,1579324459.0,I feel the advantage with this setup is that he can probably change the color and lighting of the interior and the environment of the exterior. Different wallpaper? Bam. Parallax forest outside the window? Blammo.
manga,femfh53,t1_femf23s,1579252755.0,"There wasn't much noise to begin with, clean noise too much and you start losing/smudging detail, which upscaling exacerbates."

Technically, pretty much everyone with a 401k is contributing to the problem."
news,fej9pqf,t1_fej9mgy,1579163080.0,Who knows. People tend to remember slights against them far better than they do any generosity.
news,fej9l8q,t1_fej9hy4,1579162911.0,"I mean, western imperialism was a thing for a long time. Just because they've progressed a long way since then doesn't mean that it never happened, or that they have forgotten."
news,fej9f3j,t1_fej99ge,1579162676.0,It's pretty hard to tell an oppressed nation/peoples to 'suck it up' after the very nations telling them to suck it up were also the reason they were fucked for so long. To them it just looks like hypocrisy.
news,fej95l2,t1_fej7kl4,1579162320.0,"And so they should be forced to wallow in poverty because the first-world fucked it up too bad? There's no easy answer to it. 

In an ideal world there would be global cooperation to both curtail climate change and improve the quality of life in developing countries. 

Edit: And for the record ""fuck you I got mine"" is generally the stance of the first-world, so it's evil all around."
news,fej6qve,t1_feimbiu,1579159199.0,"They make the argument that first-world nations fucked the world up while industrializing, all the while oppressing 3rd-world countries, and that now that they've had their cake and these other countries are gearing up to have some cake too, the first-world says that they aren't allowed to rise out of poverty because they fucked the world up too hard while having cake.

So these other countries say, fuck you I want my cake, and can you really blame them?"
manga,fehyml3,t1_fehis0a,1579126503.0,Sounds like a mistake that could happen if you used a tool to read the text from the bubbles and output it as a file. I get a lot of those errors using the Google Translate app.
todayilearned,feht17j,t1_fehs13v,1579123293.0,They were probably just trying to avoid over-generalizing the entire area.
manga,fdy8blz,t1_fdxvbgt,1578777110.0,Also sounds like that inferior eyes magician manga.
todayilearned,fdprjsr,t1_fdped53,1578637764.0,"Yeah, I kind of brought up off-hand to my brother, wondering at what point does the good borne of philanthropy outweigh the many lives the rich man knowingly or indirectly ruined during his lifetime. I feel it probably takes several decades at the very minimum to start breaking even."

todayilearned,fchzn1p,t1_fchviug,1577656014.0,It's like how cans of soup always say that there are two serving sizes to make the caloric content seem healthier.
gachagaming,fcax9ej,t3_eg4xsw,1577578427.0,"Not really 2019, it was something like November 2018, was playing release Epic Seven and desperately needed new characters to fill out my roster so I could advance in the story.

I kept rolling gacha for that 53.25% at rolling a character, but my first 23 rolls beyond the selective reroll were all artifacts.

That comes out to something like 1 in 4 million odds."
manga,fc7yzov,t1_fc7yejt,1577522411.0,... Bruh.
