Iran and the US have been escalating back and forth for some time now. Don’t forget Iran shooting down a drone, brazenly harassing shipping and killing a US citizen all while being a major sponsor of terrorist groups and being an overall oppressive government to its people. I think Trump’s escalation was rash and foolish, and I blame him for any direct retaliation from Iran and for the loss of face among our allies. But I don’t blame him for a bunch of Iranians dying at the funeral as sad as that is nor do I blame him for Iran being so goddamn stupid they had AA defenses that shot a passenger jet taking off from a major international airport. 

The only example I can get behind is the Ukraine one. It’s the most directly tied to Trumps actions and his actions were an abuse of power that he was actually impeached over. That one you could make a compelling argument that Trump is responsible for what happened in Ukraine because of aid being revoked. 

I guess its subjective for the most part though, where do we draw that line. I guess I could get behind blaming a war hungry president for lives lost by acts of war.

AskReddit,felzwme,t1_felwdoe,1579235343.0,"I think I might be conflating sex and gender a bit too much. But at the same time I guess I don’t even understand what gender is then and what the whole point of it is. Is it just an arbitrary term we use to describe our configuration of traits? I guess if there could be an almost infinite number of different gender labels to go along with an almost infinite number of different hormonal and genetic traits why does the concept of gender even exist at all? Aren’t we back at square one at that point? I feel like at that point it just makes sense to be labeling ourselves by our biological sex and accepting that everything thing else about us is entirely unique to us and no one label will ever truly capture it accurately. Maybe we’re just trying to put labels on things and categorize things that are just too complex to keep track of in that way. 

Either way, I’m fascinated by the whole thing. There’s so much to it, biology, psychology, genetics, sociology. I appreciate the answer.

AskReddit,felv7os,t1_felsvps,1579231760.0,"Hope I don’t come across as disrespectful, but I’d love to hear more from different perspectives about the whole non-binary concept. 

Here’s my understanding: I guess I always understood gender as really just a label for biological sex. Males and females have different builds hormones and genitalia. It always seemed pretty black and white as to which gender a person is. 

Now a male could behave in all kinds of different ways, with all kinds of varying levels of masculinity/femininity as well as different sexual orientations. Same with a female, they could be a pink dress wearing princess or a masculine tomboy, lesbian straight or anything in between. But I don’t understand how those behaviors change their status as ‘female’, or vice versa. 

I guess I feel like there really are just two genders but the real problem is that we’ve come to expect people to behave in a certain way based on gender. Nowadays more and more people feel comfortable breaking away from those gender stereotypes which is great, but since they don’t fit our traditional idea of what a male or female should be, they just reject the labels altogether and make new ones. But it seems to me that maybe the labels were fine, we just need to move past the idea that males or females should behave in any particular way based on that label. Like everyone is either male or female but there are endless different kinds of people within those two genders. 

I’d love to hear what someone who identifies as non binary has to say about the thoughts I just wrote. Non binary is becoming a very common thing and I just want to better understand it. Could be I’m looking at this all wrong and If I am I’d love to hear about it."

nfl,fehl6oj,t1_fehko09,1579118787.0,"I hate Santa Clara with a burning passion but Willis is one of my all time favorites. I’d almost consider getting a Willis jersey. I mean I won’t, but almost. The dude was just a classic badass MLB. 

Kuechly, Wagner and Willis are three of the busts I’d be most excited to see if I visit Canton someday. 1st ballot is really tough to get but they’ll all be there before too long."
nfl,fehkjan,t1_fefndi9,1579118412.0,"They’re so close to me it’s not even worth trying to debate. It’s entirely subjective. I’ve watched a lot of both of them and all I can say is fuck it flip a coin and give me either one. Can’t go wrong with either one as a player, as a teammate, as a leader or as a person off the field. 
Obviously most people would take Bobby at this point for durability and longevity but that’s not really the point. Just player vs player in their prime it’s tough to name a winner. Couple of all time great linebackers who will both be in Canton before too long."
nfl,fehjww4,t1_fegu0gh,1579118057.0,"HoF is always harder to get into then we fans give it credit for. We throw out “first ballot lock” way too often I think. Kuechly should get in, I’d bet money he will get in, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it isn’t first ballot. And that’s okay. As long as he does get in and doesn’t have to go the Kenny Easley route, that’d be some bullshit."
nfl,fehjl8n,t1_fefmvyf,1579117866.0,">	Luke just fuckin retired, have some class.

Lol I get it but come on, he didn’t die he retired. He gets to enjoy his hard earned money, focus on his health and start worrying about getting his measurements for a gold jacket and a bust in canton. It’s bittersweet I’m sure but this ultimately should be celebratory. You’re acting like this dude came into a thread about Kuechly dying and started talking shit."
nfl,fehivhk,t1_feg2fie,1579117446.0,"Even if he doesn’t get in traditionally because of longevity (I highly doubt it will happen) he would still get in eventually. Look at Kenny Easley for the Seahawks. Incredible career cut short by injuries and health issues. Didn’t get in due to longevity but was voted in by the veterans committee a couple years ago anyways. 

Easley played 7 years with 5 all pros, 5 pro bowls, a DPOY and a spot on the all decade 80s team. Kuechly is fairly similar, but played a bit longer with a few more accolades. I think he’s a lock for the HoF but even if he isn’t I wouldn’t worry. He’ll get that gold jacket one way or another."
nfl,fehht11,t1_fegku2l,1579116818.0,"Put down your pitchfork too. The Kueckly Wagner ‘rivalry’ has been a lot of fun for both teams. Two great players from the same draft that are so damn close statistically that it truly is a subjective debate. Not to mention they are both great teammates and great people. It’s almost tradition at this point to see the top comment in Wagner post be “kuechly would like a word” or vice versa. So calm down, it wouldn’t be a Kuechly appreciation post without Wagner discussion and to me that just feels right! 

Also, who signs their post “Signed, anyone using rational thought”? What the original post wasn’t patronizing enough so you had to throw that in there?"
Surveying,fehf9tr,t3_eos7yd,1579115337.0,"At least some field experience would help a lot, not just for your resume but also to have some experience and knowledge of that side of the job. I think that will help you immensely down the road. There’s a lot of different kinds of survey work and companies all do things differently, it might not be as much of a traditional ‘rodman/instrument operator’ dynamic. At our company, using mostly robotic and GNSS gear, it’s more of a party chief and an assistant. The assistant does more physical work and sets up tripods and all that, but the chief is also expected to train them and get them involved more and more with every aspect of the job so they can advance themselves after a couple years or so. Basically the crews can work a lot more together and a green rodman can get a lot of direct 1 on 1 training. 
With that experience you can either find another position more in line with the CAD tech work you’ve been training for or even move up into that position within whatever company you’ve been working for in the field. It all depends but you’ll have plenty of options. 
Being proficient in CAD is going to be really beneficial as a new tech, I really do recommend getting some field survey experience under your belt first though. It helps so much to have first hand knowledge of how field work is done when part of your job as a tech is processing and preparing field work. All the best surveyors I know really value their time in the field."

TheExpanse,feeyxrl,t1_feeg6en,1579044290.0,Her plot line this season wasn’t a part of the main book series at all. It’s a partial adaptation of one of the novellas. It kinda sets up some important background stuff about Mars but really it was just something for Bobby to do until next season when she becomes more involved in the main story again.
