Wellthatsucks,ff5zdey,t3_eru1s5,1579615061.0,That damage looks to be the result of the lightening hitting the fence.  You get a huge pressure wave that accompanies lightening strikes.  Once watched a strike hit a metal reservoir and take down the block wall surrounding the reservoir.  Nature is lit!

Political_Revolution,fehwnbe,t3_ep2mqz,1579125338.0,In 1973 I made 3 bucks an hour at my nighttime job.  I was still in school and bought a used car to get around.  42000 a year was unheard of!  My parents bought a second house for1800 that year.  They were well off and made about 15000 with both of them working.
explainlikeimfive,fef05t8,t1_feewpql,1579045085.0,You also have the pay angle.  Government employees mostly get hourly pay which requires a higher “differential” pay for hours outside of the 9 to 5.  Constituents do not want to pay government workers anything above a bare minimum.  Hence offices are closed after five.  Law enforcement and other such jobs typically are allowed the higher pay.
