Browns,ffehn64,t1_ffe489n,1579848373.0,We're ooowwwlll exterminators...
nfl,ffdr0wj,t1_ffd5zxo,1579826837.0,"They had such shitty injury luck before the season even started too, it's going to be a very different roster off the bat not even counting who else they may add in the draft and FA."
nfl,ffdqwqg,t1_ffcxmwl,1579826763.0,"I've been holding out of playing in the NFL for years without either of those things, just gotta believe in yourself champ."
nfl,ffdqbai,t1_ffd2wer,1579826388.0,"Oh baby, I'm right there"
nfl,ffdq7i2,t1_ffd5p1w,1579826321.0,"He went to HS in Athens. I don't think he grew up a Bengals fan (moved around a lot, iirc he's a saints fan cause he admires Brees), but it's not like southern Ohio isn't at least sort of his home. Doubt he'd be that mad about being in Cinci. 

Also c'mon fellow Ohioan, why you gotta do us like that?"

MurderedByWords,ff0sbuf,t1_ff0n1ph,1579471819.0,I'd honestly use it a lot
MurderedByWords,ff0mt2h,t1_ff0e79x,1579470343.0,It's times like these I wish I had a gif of the scene in Jurassic Park when Laura Dern pulled her arm out of the dino droppings.
MovieDetails,feprdd1,t1_fepqnp3,1579328699.0,Lol love that part so much. And Raph says damn a couple times early on when he loses his sai and he screams it across the city when he's chasing Casey Jones. That was so mind blowing to young me.

MurderedByWords,fenksyl,t1_fenjded,1579286817.0,"He'd perjure himself before finishing the oath. As much as I want him to show up and dig his own grave, his people would doing him a massive disservice if they let him testify."
technology,fenij0h,t1_femjmgt,1579285433.0,I bet it was Poo or Ass
nfl,fei774b,t1_fei5hd4,1579131813.0,"HS uses 12lb shots, college use 16lb."
IdiotsFightingThings,feh9d0n,t1_feh9977,1579111856.0,"I'm not the original commenter, not hoping he dies. But this is a far cry from mistaking how train guards work."
IdiotsFightingThings,feh8ybs,t1_feh8d1k,1579111609.0,Is this a mistake? Or is it actively fighting things that protect you from dying by being hit by a 1000 ton train?
AccidentalRenaissance,fea3qvr,t1_fe99l3w,1578944057.0,"Right, uh, I believe you had me in a headlock..."
Browns,fe5xtes,t1_fe5xk35,1578877340.0,"You as well. I always forget he even had that interim stint, it was quite forgettable coaching"
Browns,fe5vj9d,t1_fe5t3e5,1578875892.0,Yeah but only as an interim and he wasn't good if I recall. Nothing that suggested he was ready for two jobs at once for sure.
Browns,fe3tvbk,t1_fe3jmih,1578852812.0,"He just better not try to be HC and OC here, I'm so fucking done with that after hue and Freddie, especially since none of them had prior HC experience. Just come in and do your job and have a full staff to help."
Browns,fe2z2tg,t1_fe2c7ho,1578844420.0,I can't tell if Lamar can't play from behind or is Roman calling bad plays to dig them out. This looked exactly like our first game there and both times they struggled hard as soon as they were down even a little. Ravens were also very unlucky in the turnover department so maybe I'm just over thinking it.
Browns,fe2yld4,t1_fe2vi9f,1578844282.0,Exactly this. I knew the Titans would have a chance if they just looked to our first game at Balt. Glad someone could do something with it since we didn't make the playoffs.
Browns,fds8ei5,t1_fdrr6ec,1578696696.0,Word is that's why McCarthy had to stay the night with Jerry.
todayilearned,fdlp9x7,t1_fdlm65u,1578529248.0,This guy Mad Max's.
todayilearned,fdlp5gj,t1_fdlaixj,1578529165.0,"Yeah, I can just hear them say ""V8 Interceptor"" in the Aussie accent. Sounds like V8 Intahceptah, and I love it."

politics,fdkzh1c,t1_fdkw1zt,1578514340.0,It's a rigid airship. And that's not how helium works!
witcher,fck9l1i,t1_fck8zb1,1577720248.0,"The main reason is because of the wildly popular games which has a much bigger existing audience than the books. The books just give them fresh and more fleshed out stories to lean on for content that hasn't been seen by the majority of people before. Not saying the books aren't good or aren't being used, but the game being regarded as one of the best games ever, especially of this decade, is why this show got made."
Browns,fcilf93,t1_fcib8wx,1577664531.0,Flores looks like a really good hire. Kept that team fighting and doing weird shit just to have a chance and it got them to buy in and they look like they'll be feisty after they use all those draft picks. Freddie has been the exact opposite of that.
politics,fc5rz0v,t1_fc5gorb,1577464554.0,"Should've kept marching so they'd never dare to even threaten to ""rise again""."
breakingbad,fc0cy13,t1_fbzn3vj,1577287280.0,"There was a plate of Belgian waffles out here in the hall, did you eat them?"
sports,fbzbb9q,t1_fbydvjd,1577241007.0,You just gotta send a letter like this one out to the various ball clubs. Who knew it was this easy?
