relationships,ff6iidp,t1_ff5ysyd,1579627927.0,"While you don't mind paying the bills, it's actually important to have a discussion about these things with your current or any future partner so that there is an established set of expectations.

In America, habits between two individuals, especially people living under the same roof, can act as contracts that are legally protected. So if you find yourself in a situation where you *may want a future roommate* or partner to contribute financially, where they hadn't before, they may have standing to not pay given the history you've established. 

Talk to your boyfriend anyway about contributing to the household. Set firm expectations that you both can be held accountable to. Explain that even though the relationship is unequal, that doesn't actually excuse him from participating  in it in good faith. 

And stop paying all the bills. It's not about hwo comfortable you are with the financial burden. It's self-protective. Take account of your earnings. Apportion the investment accordingly. If he makes 1/3 the money you do, he can contribute 1/3 to the bills-- unless that is unreasonable. But talk about it. Always. All the time. Keep in touch with the states of your lives outside of the relationship you two share together."

soccer,fer5wkb,t1_fepoac6,1579350242.0,"It's important to recognize that needing ""every bit of speed"" is not the same thing as *being fast* and *relying on speed* as the basis of your playing style. We can make a direct intra-era comparison between Michael Owen and Luis Figo as an example. Both of them needed all the speed they had. They're professional athletes. That comes with the territory. But Luis Figo's playing style relied very little on him using his top speed a statistically significant amount of time. Figo's playing style relied distinctly on his capacity to off-balance defenders, by lateral and not forward momentum. 

Speed is a biomechanical phenomenon and is defined largely by the body's capacity to exert a certain amount of force in an expected direction. That force is directly related to the hamstring muscle. Faster people are more likely to fuck up their hamstrings, because of what the hamstring does during running. A slower person is less likely to injure and re-injure their hamstrings during a sprint.

And a faster person is more likely to use their top speed more often than a slower person and for different lengths of time.

Take a long distance runner and a sprinter and have them both sprint at top speed in a 100m dash, and if you were forced to bet on who cramps, tears, or fully ruptures their hamstring, I would urge you to bet against the sprinter. Michael Owen actually had every reason to be concerned about re-injuring himself by fully utilizing his speed. Harry Kane has less reason to."

It's important to remember that the substance of the allegations come from 4 anonymous sources within the Warren camp. The Warren camp has made little to no effort to either confirm or debunk the allegations made by those internal sources. So the Warren camp, Warren in particular because she was the one engaged in the very conversation in question, is complicit.

Imagine if high schooler Mary Sue spreads a rumor about some other girl Jane, because both Mary Sue and Jane want Quarterback Richard. And then when Tiffany brings up the rumor to Mary Sue, Mary Sue, the creator of the very rumor, responds, ""I won't dignify that rumor with an answer.""

And now hfxRos comes around and is like: wow, Mary Sue is really doing the right thing here. I support her 110% even though she's not taking ownership of the rumor she herself spread or is helping to promote by her silence.

I'll fill in the blanks. In the most recent season of the show, one of the protagonists finds himself working at an ice cream shop. One of the minor subplot threads involves him striking out with women during the summer of his employment. Over the course of the season, he begins to develop feelings for the girl who mans the ice scream shop with him. Earlier on, she tells him this story about how she used to stare at and obsess over him when they attended the same high school. This matters later on when he expresses his feelings for her. She then clarifies the story, letting him know that she wasn't obsessing over him because of romantic feelings towards him, but because *the girl she liked* couldn't stop staring at him, and she didn't understand what the heck she saw in the dude--even though she likes him in a platonic way now. It's literally one scene towards the end of the season, but it's something that has in fact been developed throughout.
