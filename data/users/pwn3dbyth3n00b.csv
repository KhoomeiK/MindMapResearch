loseit,ffafdt5,t3_esiiwm,1579734444.0,"From what I know about endurance training and keto diet is that it is possible to actually train for endurance on a keto diet. Theres an [ultra marathoner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96VZFklUM_Q) who eats a high fat diet to do his long races but the problem with it is that you will not be able to do time PRs or ""push"" yourself hard if you're fueling yourself with fats alone. If you push yourself somewhere along the lines of >70% your VO2 max, physiologically and biochemically speaking, its impossible when you push your speed too hard with keto your body is demanding too much ATP (energy) than is physically possible to produce with the Fatty Acid Metabolism pathway that a keto diet forces you to use as your main source of ATP production. Thats why when you say you when you eat a bit more carbs you don't feel like dying because your body is able to use the Carbohydrate metabolism pathway (which is a lot more responsive than the fatty acid path way, even tho fatty acids are able to densely store more energy per gram of metabolic fuel) That extra carbs you eat help with the energy demand you put on your body.   


If I were you I'd wouldn't do a keto diet while training for a marathon or at least up your carbs slightly so you wont feel like you're dying. Especially if you're trying to break a time record of yours or something. But if you do want to continue doing a keto diet then you'll have to slow the pace down so you're not over demanding energy from your body that it cannot produce on time. It won't feel like you're dying when you find the fine balance in your pacing between demand and supply of energy your body can keep up with. I'm interested in how you are going to eat during the race. Are you going to pack nuts and stuff to eat on the run? During my runs the only thing they had was gatorade, sugary protein bars, fruits and runner gels, all not keto friendly."

loseit,feidve1,t3_ep7i2i,1579136215.0,Theres nothing special about a protein shake vs actual foods. Its not healthier or anything but it sure is convenient. Protein as a macronutrient is quite filling so if you want to replace a meal with it then I guess its a good thing. I use it to get my protein in post workout or if I wanted to hit a protein goal but don't have enough calories left to eat a meat. The one thing is that usually for it to be a meal replacement where it makes me full I have to take 3+ servings which usually turns out to be about 75+g of protein. Taking that much protein at once tends to make you have protein gas. Your farts will be deadly. Normally I take two scoops of protein to get 50g of protein post workout and that feels similar to eating 2 oranges or something but not a whole meal.

As long as you're eating enough protein like 0.7g per lb and you have a high body fat percentage then you'll be able to recomp at maintenance or a slight deficit. Here's how I measure my progress with a body recomp that keeps me sane.

\-Take before pictures and one monthly but dont compare it until 2+ months later because you might not notice any difference the first few months and discourage yourself further.

\-Measure your lifts, if you are lifting heavier or higher volumes then you're making progress with a recomp although your strength will eventually stall if you stay at maintenance or a slight deficit.

\-Use a tape measure to track your measurements instead of a scale to track weigh. ""Feeling your clothes fit differently"" was a poor way for me to measure my progress because at first my clothes were actually fitting worse while staying the same weight (i was tracking weight at the time) It was extremely disheartening. Turns out that my shoulders were getting broader, chest growing out and my lats getting significantly wider making all my clothes not fit on the top anymore. My waist stayed the same since thats were I store most of my body fat while my thighs, forearm, calf and neck got smaller in diameter but more define.
