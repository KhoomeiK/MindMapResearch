offmychest,fcb84wq,t3_egonvr,1577583604.0,"I need to keep improving myself a lot more. My buddies always ask me when I'm gonna look for someone to date or hook up with, but I can't fathom having to take care of another person when I can't even look after myself. They think I'm gay which I know I'm not but the thought of going to a club or bar just to look for someone to sleep with seems really degrading to me."
