lupus,ff8bs97,t1_ff89tf0,1579672172.0,I hope that you can get a diagnosis quickly! It seems like any type of specialist takes forever to get in as a new patient (unless you get lucky and get a cancellation) I always ask to be on the cancellation list for that exact reason. Good luck to you!
lupus,ff88lst,t3_es736w,1579669170.0,"From my experience and what I've seen in various support groups (not sure if you're active on Facebook but there are great support groups there) testing does not always support your symptoms. I have symptoms and my rheumatologist can see them, yet my blood work will come up fine. For many people it takes on average years to get diagnosed. It took me about 3 years. I'm 40 year old female. It sounds from what you're saying that a round of steroids would greatly improve your symptoms. I'm no doctor and don't work directly in the medical field so please don't take this as medical advice. I was able to get diagnosed with lupus due to my positive ANA, and multitude of symptoms over the years. It took several different doctors before one said well you have the symptoms and the positive ana, let's treat you. That wonderful doctor moved to a different city, and the one I have now says my bloodwork still supports lupus. I don't have any direct experience with the VA but from what dear friends have told me it isn't always a walk in the park to deal with. Is it possible to still be covered but to see someone outside of the VA? I'm not sure how that works. If so, that may be a good option. I've found this sub to be very helpful with questions and support. Wishing you all the best!"

He went and got some fabric, floral tape and I'm guessing floral wire, and made me up some flowers. They look kind of like tulips or roses. He made a dozen, 6 red and 6 blue, and added some fake baby's breath with it. He went to a craft store to get it. That was my very first birthday present from him when we started dating. They will never die. And while our relationship hasn't made it, I'll still treasure them forever. It was a beautiful gesture that I will appreciate always.

The other girl, Valerie, had an STI. When she found out my friend was dating the guy, she went around the whole office and told EVERYONE that my friend now had this STI because she was sleeping with this guy. My friend found out after everyone else had already heard. I worked a schedule where I worked 9 hour days but had one half day every other week, so I happened to have already left that day. Everyone was called into the managers office and it was a huge shit show. I'm almost sorry I missed it. Amazingly, Valerie wasn't fired for that, or for any of her other shenanigans while working there. I'm sure I have other good ones I'm just too tired to think of them at the moment."

I just couldn't imagine leaving her. I held her close and thanked her over and over again. When I finally pulled it together, I left and checked into the hospital for a few days to get myself back in a better place. She still knows when I'm not okay, and she is my little shadow.

Like other have mentioned, who would want to see their sister wear the dress they were supposed to wear? How can you sit there and be happy for your sister while she's living the dream you were supposed to have? And to add to that,  what the fuck is wrong with people saying it's okay for your ex to cheat? I agree with you 100%. Cheating is cheating. It doesn't matter if it was a bachelor party.

I went to Pensacola Beach a few years ago and was a smoker at the time but refused to smoke on the beach. I smoked next to my car in the parking lot and that was that. My ex picked up (with his hands covered) butts all around where we were sitting. We later moved over to Ft. Pickens where we didn't see that problem, and less seaweed in the water.

You do have to pay for parking, but there is plenty of road parking if you don't want to pay parking lot fees. You may have to walk a bit but if you want to save money it's worth it! Some attractions do charge. I'm not sure if they still have sea lions, but when they did it was a small charge to watch the show. It was also a small charge to ride the train. The food in the zoo is generally pretty pricey. You can always leave the zoo for lunch and return. I mean, free zoo, who cares?"

AmItheAsshole,fc5sj37,t3_eg8hdn,1577464896.0,"My first thought was go to the wedding and go wild and have a great time. Then I read through the comments and changed my mind. Many of these people are right. The guests would only see your behavior and judge you both, not question the reasoning behind it. She's the bride they're going to listen to her crazy ass. Ever hear that the best revenge is to simply live well? Maybe that's the best choice here. Live well. Maybe her ex is the love of your life and this has brought you together. Maybe not. Maybe you'll wind up living a dream you never imagined. If either of the couple to be married cheated to wind up in the scenario they are in now, they are likely to cheat again. Sure they will have their wedding and be all showy and have all the pretty pictures to post all over social media. But that's one day, not real life. They may not be as happy as they seem. The petty bitch in me wishes them not so nice things. But the good parts of me, they wish you and her ex all the best. It has to be damned hard to be in the situation you're in. Whatever happened to chicks before dicks? All the best to you. If you don't go, I'd get together with her ex and go out somewhere and have a great time. Make a happy memory out of a shitty situation. I also agree with others that I would cut contact. Karma will be coming for them both."
