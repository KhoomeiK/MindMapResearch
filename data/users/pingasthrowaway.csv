sylasmains,fdptvy0,t3_emitr6,1578640290.0,"This would really go against every other dash/2-part ability in the game. Ex: Fiora gets her CD reduced when hitting a target with Q. This prevents her using it to run away and encourages chasing rather than running, and that's a huge part of her power budget and how her kit is balanced. 


New Sylas is heavily balanced around mana and base stats, not getting a shield on his E and wasting the mana if you use it to disengage is part of his power budget and changing it would effect his balancing resulting in further nerfs in other areas."

The world is chaotic and there are so many things that can happen without warning, so try not to fret about it, just do smart things to reduce risks, like eating fruits/vegetables and limiting or better yet abstaining from smoking and drinking. 


When you have any of these concerns, definitely talk about them with your doctor. You pay them for their time, and education is a part of their job. We live in such an advanced society where most illnesses are completely curable and many can be treated effectively, and cancer is that grim reminder of our mortality. 100s of billions of dollars have been spent on cancer research, we're constantly finding better treatments, causative agents, and someday I'm sure we'll find an actual cure."

Politicians love to blame marijuana for being a gateway drug (despite studies that show it isn't), but they never seem to give a shit about the legal drug alcohol that is actually doing what they claim marijuana does.

news,fdmo5yd,t1_fdmmq3m,1578557658.0,"Stomach cancer is hereditary and also can be caused by smoking. There's concern that nitrites, used in highly processed foods like lunch meats are contributing to cancer, especially stomach cancer. Alcoholism also contributes to stomach cancer risk. Stomach cancer has similar warning signs as ulcers. If you throw up or have nausea for no discernible reason, and if you throw up blood, you would want to make sure your doctor knows that. The above can have many different causes but they're cause for an investigation regardless. 


Don't fret over it, just do everything you can to minimize your risk. Quitting smoking and drinking is the best thing you can do, these habits cause so many cancers that aren't particularly likely otherwise."

Your risk of lung cancer will drop dramatically and continuously drop the longer you haven't been smoking, but you'll always have a higher risk than someone who has never been a chronic smoker. 


Just include the timeframe in which you smoked (EX: age 25-35) when providing health history to your doctors and see what they have to say. Regardless, if you stop now and never smoke again, your risk will be a fraction of what it would be if you continue smoking."

news,fdmeskt,t1_fdmbj78,1578547531.0,"Cancer is categorized by stages. If it's localized (in one area like a lump on the breast) the malignant growth and a wide area around the growth (to be extra cautious) can be removed. 


The problem is when it begins to spread. If you've got cancer throughout your entire body, your blood, your bones, etc, you can't just remove it. At this point the cancer becomes less likely to be curable, and you pretty much can only keep it at bay with more aggressive forms of treatment with serious side effects.


There are slow-growing cancers like non-invasive carcinomas that can take years to become a serious problem, you might even die without them ever being an issue, they might just sit there in one spot and not do a whole lot. *You would obviously still treat these if they are detected. Then there are fast-growing cancers like lung cancer that easily grows out of control before you intervene."

If there's a cause for concern, you've had a history of cancer personally or it's common in your family, get checked sooner than later and the prognosis is exponentially better.


EDIT: Since this comment kind of blew up I'm adding more important info.


Sadly cancer is too complex to give a concrete when or how to screen for it answer. It depends on the type of cancer you're deemed at risk for. Some cancers like colorectal cancer put all men at risk regardless of genetics, so you'd probably be advised to screen for that around age 50, regardless of race, health history, etc. The methods used for most of the ""routine"" cancer screenings (breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung are among the most common) are fairly effective and non-invasive (well a colonoscopy seems super invasive for the patient but my point is it's not going to hurt you like a major surgery). Unfortunately some cancers like pancreatic cancer have less of an indication aside from diabetes and hyperglycemia putting you at higher risk, and very early screenings might not catch any evidence that the cancer is developing. 


The bottom line is that you need to give your doctors any relevant health information and let them offer you advice on how to go forward. They'll determine if you're considered low or high-risk for certain illnesses and encourage a proactive approach if you're high risk. Also, not all cancers are hereditary so don't freak out if your great uncle twice removed died of cancer. Most cancers are sporadic, or non-hereditary (and could be brought on by all kinds of things or random mutations)... which probably isn't going to provide you with any relief, but I digress, the reason hereditary cancer is so relevant is that there are more ways to prepare for it and be proactive."
aww,fdm6vcm,t3_em230r,1578541253.0,"I hate how people call everything weeds. Wildflowers like dandelions aren't weeds, they're beautiful flowers... Cloves aren't weeds, they're technically both an herb and legume.


Weeds are an undesirable plant by definition, and if you'd rather have a dirt or grass lawn than be blessed with a variety of plants that benefit the wildlife, you're a dumbass. Everything is considered a weed because of this absurd American belief that a lawn of grass should be the only thing you see.


EDIT: Forgot to mention that the typical grass lawn is also super bad for the environment. It wastes tons of water as opposed to [xeriscaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeriscaping), which encourages the lawn to grow anything that can grow without the need for constant irrigation."

leagueoflegends,fdhuogg,t3_elg11u,1578430463.0,"Tbh I don't like that Nami change. It's the last thing I max because i want a lower cooldown on her Q, so the damage is pretty negligible. If it procs so easily it's just going to waste all 3 slows since they don't stack and that makes her lose a ton of her CC. It's already a problem lategame when ADCs do all 3 hits in a second, now it's going to be a problem even sooner and on non-adcs, not to mention her Q will proc one of the slows if she casts it on herself, completely wasting that slow because the enemy is already knocked up. 



tl;dr the nami E change is going to reduce the amount of time her slow is applied to enemies and be an unintended nerf."

I'm hopeful, but I have absolutely 0 expectation of Netflix shows being concluded at this point, especially with Lost in Space being so high budget. The cancelled shows I mentioned had very low budgets in comparison and they got canned, so in the end there are many reasons a show gets cancelled and Netflix just has a reputation for not committing to anything."
