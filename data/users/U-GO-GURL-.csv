YouShouldKnow,fg66ydl,t1_fg64chh,1580556811.0,"I get pulled over probably three times a year definitely when I’m breaking a law usually speed related. 

The last 12 months I was pulled over for speeding… I got a ticket for a cracked windshield instead. 

The second time I got pulled over for speeding I was doing 50 in a 35… I got a ticket for 9 miles over. 

The third time I got pulled over Was because I had my cell phone in my hand. When the cop came up to my car he said “what are you doing checking your GPS? “ I said yes and he gave me a warning. So the cop was trying to keep me out of trouble.


One time I came home from work and there were two cop cars on my front lawn. I went into the house and found out my three-year-old… Who had just learned about dialing 911… had called the cops. The cops were very polite.


The only (relatively) negative experience I had with cops was one time I hit a deer on the way home which disabled my car. My neighbor was behind me and drove me home. Before I rode home I called the state police who told me to go home. Half hour later a County cop drove onto my lawn with the lights on, banged on my door and asked why I left the scene of an accident. I showed him my cell phone logs which showed I called the state police. He apologized and took off.

So I had some run-ins with the law but nothing serious.

By the way I got the cracked windshield fixed and the ticket was dismissed. I got probation before judgment for the speeding ticket."
YouShouldKnow,fg66omu,t1_fg66hit,1580556434.0,"This is true. 

But the truth is also I have lived in various places in the United States for the last 62 years. I have had many  many interactions with state/county highway patrol people. All those interactions have been extremely professional. I have never experienced the violence that is written up in the newspapers or stories on television.

The county where I live in is known for its people peaceful cops. There are never any stories about cops abusing citizens only cops helping citizens.

So I do this not out of fear, but out of the desire not to get a ticket. I don’t expect that some cop is going to shoot me accidentally at a traffic stop, but again why get into an argument with a guy with a gun!"

YouShouldKnow,fg5pcyb,t3_ex0f0w,1580534140.0,"When I get pulled over by a cop the first thing I do is put down all the windows in my car. My windows are tinted and I don’t want the cop to think that something was going on in the backseat that he couldn’t see.

The next thing I do is put my hands on the steering wheel so the cop can see it and don’t say a word.

The third thing I do is be completely polite. Yes sir. No sir. Thank you sir.

Depending on the circumstances, I either act dumb, like this posting suggests, or I act extremely apologetic. The last time I got pulled over, I was doing 55 in a 45 lane. I told the officer, “I am very very sorry. I drive this road every day going to work. I always drive 45 in this lane. This time I was distracted by something I heard on the radio. It was totally my fault. But I want you to know that I drive 45 on this road every day and this is just a one time thing.“ The officer gave me a warning.

In the circumstances were the officer gave me a ticket, again I am Polite, I might try and start some friendly discussions. (Like I asked the officer to tell my kids sitting in the backseat how important it is to wear their seatbelts all the time.) And I always take it to court. Once I get to court I told the judge, before the officer has anything to say, that I appreciate the professionalism of the officer, officer was very polite. Officer did a great job. I really butter him up. This has resulted in 100% dismissal of tickets.

I never get mad. I never get short with the officer. I don’t necessarily admit anything but I always say thank you. I’m sure cops see enough a*****es that the nice ones stand out."

relationship_advice,fg5oerl,t3_ewzv4a,1580533266.0,"1. If one is to get circumcised one should get it done when one is not going to remember someone cutting their penis tip off. At birth. When every sensation is a blur. It would be horrible for your son to be 32 and have to spend weeks dreading his next erection because his parents made him wait till then to get his circumcision.

2.  I don’t want to make this sound like I’m being a jerk, but do you have a p***s? The one with the penis knows what it’s like to live with a uncircumcised or circumcised  p***s so is probably better qualified to make the decision. Again I don’t want to sound like I’m being a jerk and I apologize if I do.

3. You have to think like a teenage boy. Your typical teenage boy is going to be bullied in the locker room for being uncircumcised. 

4. Do you want to give your typical teenage boy something else to clean? Because it’s not gonna get done. When I was 15, if I had to pull back some foreskin on a regular basis and clean out gunk because my parents Didn’t have the foresight “LOL” to circumcise me I would be pissed.

5. In the United States, for the most part, circumcision is the norm. Look at any porn video.  Lol. 

6. Do you want your husband to tell you what to do with your body? Because he doesn’t understand the female body? Well he does understand the male body and should be making decisions for your son based on that.

In any case good luck with your wonderful gift."
