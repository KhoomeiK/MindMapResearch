I couldn’t wrap my head around the thought that a god who is meant to be all about forgiveness and protecting the innocent, killed thousands of kids to punish a rather small group of people. Also couldn’t justify how if there is a god, why he’d let so much terrible shit happen to good people nearly constantly."

Many people are either unaware of this, already have the dog and just don’t have the time or just can’t be bothered. It’s very unfortunate."

memes,ff5jhv4,t1_ff5hy10,1579595794.0,"Yep, they characterise it as an abnormal and repetitive behaviour that interferes with daily functioning. Behaviours can include, frequent/constant spinning in circles, self-mutation, pacing, etc."
memes,ff59ox6,t1_ff4yunm,1579584472.0,"I’m not sure about the herding part but he definitely saves koalas! Bear is a Koala Detection dog, he sniffs out koalas in fire torn areas and sits when he finds a one so they can then be relocated and receive treatment if needed. He was originally abandoned by his owners for being ‘too energetic’ and was later diagnosed with OCD, which has helped him be a great tracker. You should google him, he’s a gorgeous dog."
wholesomegifs,fe6gqwm,t3_enq2k8,1578890400.0,"The women owned a kangaroo sanctuary that burned down in the bush fires. Many of her kangaroos died but those who did survive returned to the area later on, this was one of those kangaroos."
natureismetal,fd21bag,t1_fcyf1d8,1578140113.0,"These guys have big balls indeed, they’re pretty mean despite looking cute as fuck. Otters run in family lodges and those Caiman are the smallest species of crocodiles and if given the chance they will eat otter pups. So when Otters find them in their territory they have been known to gang up on them, biting and harassing them until they either retreat or they kill them. This was most likely a intimidating display practically going ‘fuck you, mate. You ain’t shit. I’ll roll around in front of you and then bash you with my mates later.’ They’ve even been known to take down anacondas."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fcczoq3,t3_egvpmf,1577604569.0,"First night of having my new kitten, she was sleeping on my bed next to my head and when I rolled over in the middle of the night the side of my face went into the most foul smelling puddle of diarrhoea. She had stepped in it and tracked it all over my bed, it was so acidic that it was literally burning my face. Not fun."
EntitledBitch,fcbse8m,t1_fcbm7pc,1577590444.0,"That’s unbelievable, can’t believe a country as wealthy as America would pay their workers such complete shit. The fact that businesses over there rely on customers to pay their workers is fucked, if you can’t afford to pay your workers a decent wage you can’t afford to run a business."
EntitledBitch,fcbd9b5,t3_egt217,1577585448.0,"$2.13 an hour! WTF. How could one possibly support themselves on such low rates? I hope that’s not the actual number cause that’s total bullshit and even illegal over here, minimum wage is $19.49 in Aus which still isn’t great."
dogswithjobs,fc0db7i,t1_fc0cbcu,1577287605.0,"Think the process differs depending on the location, species, conservation group and impact of not intervening (how many clutches of eggs would be lost and the overall loss to the species) It’s risky disturbing them and a difficult process to move them so now that I think about it, they probably did do it that way as it’s safer for the developing embryo. Was just going off what the zoo I was volunteering at was doing."
dogswithjobs,fc0blgc,t1_fc0aitz,1577286038.0,Just incase there’s anything sharp on the beach or hidden in the hand.
dogswithjobs,fc0bg20,t1_fc0acuj,1577285898.0,Both I’d imagine.
dogswithjobs,fc07r6u,t1_fc078oo,1577282124.0,"Some do as you can’t find every single nest due to the large abundance of them but it saves many from thieves, rising tides (eggs drown) or people accidentally stepping on nests once they have been semi-exposed from weather conditions. As far as I’m aware once hatched the baby turtles will be released a little bit up the beach where they will scramble to the water. It’s better to release them further up as then they can see if any are weak or sickly since healthy baby turtles should be able to make their way across the beach to the water (if not picked off by birds and such) They also do a head count of the number of eggs being laid, the percentage of male to female babies and so on."
