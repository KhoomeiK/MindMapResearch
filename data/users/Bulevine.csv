ConanExiles,ffa6yxo,t1_ffa62jo,1579729089.0,"My man.. ain't nothing ""more difficult"" about stacking cubes on top of each other and then spreading them out in all directions. What IS more difficult is fitting 4 or 5 walls in 1 foundation space, in a highly defensible position, with hidden spawn points and exits, and traps. I'm not saying what you have is ineffective... I'm saying, it's a blob. Cause it is. Its pvp, nothing should be aesthetic if you want to keep it."
criticalrole,ffa5rxp,t3_esdirz,1579728432.0,"About a year ago my friends offered to let me try dnd for the first time. They all live in Maryland and I live in Texas so we struggled to figure out the tech and how it would all work. They asked if I had ever heard of Critical Role, which I had not... that campaign  ended a few weeks ago due to our DM not having the time, sadly..  but in that time I became completely addicted to not only CR content, but them as people and have new role models.  

Also, with this new passion for DND I decided to take up the DM mantle! Our group of 3 turned into a group of 7 before our first session.. I was so intimidated. I watched every DM tips many times, handbooker helpers, still chewed away at C1 (E95 now) and we were off!!! Session 1 was amazing and I wouldn't have been able to handle DMing had it not been for my excessive exposure to CR streams in such a short amount of time.  

Our new group lives(for now) and I get to continue with this new passion creating a world for them all because of Critical Role :)  

Edit: Also, San Antonio shipping to my loc.. jus sayin' ;)"

worldnews,ff3tq4o,t1_ff3a6rh,1579548648.0,"Not necessarily. While that ABSOLUTELY can help and networking is one great way to increase your skills and pay, doing the crappy job nobody wants to do has gotten be pretty far. I work in IT and have advanced pretty quickly in my career and promotions due to the fact that I charge head first into the tasks and responsibilities everyone else avoids. While their performance reviews are average and ""meeting expectations"" mine are usually filled with points on leadership and deliverables that led to overall team success where I end up in the position to be directing career professionals with 15-20 years more experience than me.  

TLDR: Doing the crappy jobs and efforts can also mean job security and nonstandard success, leading to better pay."
