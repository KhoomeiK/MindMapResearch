Spanish,ff5b1mi,t3_erpelp,1579585768.0,"In Spain specifically, it is very common to use “vale” as the phrase “OK.” You’ll also often hear Spaniards say bien or bueno in place of “vale” or “ok.”"
solotravel,felt58j,t3_epkfky,1579230292.0,"Whenever you’re in a city that’s on an island or next to a river, take a water taxi to get a nice view of the city instead of paying for a tour cruise. You’ll be saving a load of money while also getting the same views."
dating,fels29g,t3_epqwd6,1579229534.0,"This guy was my dream boy. He was everything I looked for in a person and he was beautiful- I felt like I scored the jackpot. But eventually I learned about his personal, deep-seated issues that he needed to address. We were also in different points of our lives and couldn’t find some sort of compromise. It kind of makes me feel hopeless, because I feel like everytime I finally have something good, it doesn’t work out in the end. I try to be optimistic, but it’s hard. The silver lining is difficult to find sometimes."
heartbreak,feimxx7,t3_ep7d4w,1579142288.0,"I had a dream that my ex texted me saying “I miss you.” I woke up and it wasn’t real. I hate it. Keep your head up, op. Time will heal."
offmychest,feaf9v8,t1_fe9xoby,1578947960.0,I should probably do that as a reminder
offmychest,feaf75i,t1_fe9ujdg,1578947916.0,I know for sure it was the company and shared hobbies. I keep trying to remind myself of why I shouldn’t text himself. It’s hard. Crafting the life I want- that’s a really great piece of advice that no one’s given me before. Seriously. Thank you.

heartbreak,fdqi40g,t3_emmzzk,1578667232.0,Going through the same exact thing. What’s worse is that they can’t even acknowledge that. I’m so sorry you have to go through this too.
heartbreak,fdph5gw,t1_fdolfs0,1578628500.0,"The first time we broke up was about a month ago, but we finally actually ended it just a couple weeks ago. I’m still trying to deal with it. I’m right there with you. I’m trying to accept the fact that there are reasons why I shouldn’t keep him in my life anymore. I can’t keep looking at the very few positives among the many negatives about him. Maybe it’s just us wanting to keep the comfort of having something familiar. Keep your head up. You will get through this- we both will."
travel,fdobdz5,t1_fdo21y2,1578602132.0,"What I mean is you often don’t hear of people dreaming to go to Croatia or have it on their bucket list- in America, at least. In recent years, for sure, the amount of tourists coming to Croatia is only rising."

Skincare_Addiction,fdn3urx,t3_em4n4d,1578576503.0,"If you don’t mind spending a little more than usual on moisturizer, the Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing GEL works wonders for me. I have the same type of skin, and it took me years to find something that was best suit for my skin. The gel lotion is not greasy at all, and moisturizes my skin well without making it oily. Note that I say the gel! As Clinique has two kinds of Dramatically Different moisturizers."
heartbreak,fdm7sjz,t1_fdm64vu,1578541910.0,"That’s a good question. We were toxic for each other. I can’t deny that I was toxic, because I was."
heartbreak,fd5reh8,t3_ek1qif,1578180640.0,"This keeps happening to me, too. The feeling is overwhelming and dreadful and hard to control. I find that when I start feeling that way, I turn to something that will force me to keep my mind off of that anxiety- like driving, for example. Try to find something that will distract you when that feeling comes over you again. Stay strong op. Inbox me if you need someone to talk to."
AskReddit,fd5coyw,t1_fcv4ael,1578176316.0,"I’ve never seen pickpocketing so bad as I did when I lived in Spain. I made sure I was careful during my time there, but I was pickpocketed anyways. It is especially bad in Barceona. You’ll hear stories constantly of people being pickpocketed, even in broad daylight. I guess that’s any touristy city, though."
AskReddit,fcuua29,t1_fcuickf,1577988634.0,"I studied in Madrid for a semester. As an American, I can tell you life is much different there, but better. A saying I heard was, “Americans live to work. Spaniards work to live.” That can apply to most Europeans, though. I will say that Spain has a really unstable economy and politics are quite corrupt aswell. It’s also important to learn Spanish because it felt that not all Spaniards were welcoming of Americans when I lived there."
AskReddit,fcutm6u,t3_eizm2t,1577988245.0,"Austria. When I visited a couple of months ago, I fell in love with it in the midst of travelling Europe- I think that says something."
heartbreak,fcut5cd,t1_fcqe6nc,1577987991.0,I’m so sorry to hear that. I hope that once you heal you continue to grow as a person. Stay strong. I hope your year is eventually filled with happiness.

studyAbroad,f6pa128,t3_drvfng,1573051451.0,"I had this same problem at the Spanish Boston consulate for my student visa earlier this year!

I had to check every morning at 8am to see if they had appointments. It took me nearly a month and a half to finally schedule an appointment. I found that this consulate only opens up appointment bookings once every few weeks, and they book up fast. On the other hand, when appointments are cancelled, you are able to book for that specific time slot that was once taken. Definitely check everyday in the morning and good luck! It’s definitely a stressful process."
