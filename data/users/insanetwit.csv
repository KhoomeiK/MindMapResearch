It wasn't... By more than I thought (like $40 cheaper paying by trip)

I never looked back."
magicTCG,fffszlu,t1_ffeznd6,1579891138.0,"> ""kill the character who market tests least well"" is direction numero uno in Hack's Guide to Writing. 

I remember hearing that Harry Kim on Star Trek Voyager was supposed to die, but then Garrett Wang won like a TV guide ""hottest actors"" type of list, and so Kim was spared and they wrote out Kes (the second least liked character) instead."

worldnews,ff8z20i,t3_es5ol6,1579700575.0,"Sometimes you need to make the decision for people. I always think of the $1 coin in Canada vs the $1 coin in America.

In America the $1 coin never gained any traction, because people keep saying they want a $1 bill. In Canada when the $1 coin was minted, the $1 bill was discontinued. Sure people complained, but after a bit we adapted.

Same with the $2 coin. And with the removal of the penny.

Coke says ""The people demand plastic!"" They're not wrong, but if one day Coke said ""No more plastic"" people would adapt. This is purely a bottom line thing."
gaming,ff6ejvm,t3_ersj0p,1579625481.0,"What I liked was there was no way to save him if you did everything ""Right"". 

You had to fuck up 2 things that most players wouldn't do. (Kill Wrex in ME1, and Destroy the Data in ME2. Also obviously Mordan had to Survive ME2, which seems to REALLY want him to die during the final assult!)  to get the option where you could convince him that this wasn't  the time to save the Krogan, and he would join the crucible scientists. 

If you want to give it a try though, this IS the default state of the game if you start a new ME 3 game."
