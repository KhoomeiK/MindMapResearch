The actual reason was that Melbourne wanted a capability that didn't exist yet (the ability to have gates that you just walk through without swiping) and funded development into a system promising that without checking if it was possible, then when it turned out not to be too much money had been sunk to make cancelling Myki and going with an established solution politically feasable.
