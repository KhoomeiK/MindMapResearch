MurderedByWords,ff61rbz,t1_ff60u6d,1579616929.0,"The reason there are many outliers is because it isn't a good rule. Humans have just under 20,000 genes and flies and worms aren't far behind. There are many species with much larger genomes with many duplicate copies of roughly the same genes. 

You don't need a wider variety of proteins to make a more complex organism. The way cells are constructed and maintained is roughly the same. You do need more complicated ways in which those cells are organized, but they don't need much more genome complexity to get that. 

A human body is roughly like that of a mouse, minus the tail. We are larger - that's just more of the same. We're also smaller than many animals. We have complicated brains, but the complexity is in the number of neuronal connections. That can be developed from a pretty simple recipe that just ""cooks"" longer."
