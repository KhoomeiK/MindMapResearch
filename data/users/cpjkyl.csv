EDAnonymous,fc2bbsb,t3_efn8ca,1577350079.0,"im asian too and to my family, the thinner the better. their standards for an ideal body is drastically different compared to western culture. my younger sister has always been stick thin and i used to be so jealous. i think my ed has gotten a lot worse though because even though my sister is underweight, i no longer see her as my goal. i want to be even skinnier. everytime a family member comments on my weight i start another fast but my parents force me to eat whenever they find out im skipping meals. such a pain because they tell me i have to eat but then whenever i do, they say i look like a pig. literally the only reason i have not killed myself yet is because i want to die as thin as possible. even if im dead, i dont want ppl to make mean comments about my weight. i just want to be skinny no matter what the cost."
