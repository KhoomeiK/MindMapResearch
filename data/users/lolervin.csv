depression,fegoq66,t1_feg103y,1579098914.0,"That's a grand offer. I'd like to offer the same, and i mean this genuinely. I'm in Denmark which is a fair bit closer. Come for a week, a month, a year, however long you want to. I live in a studio appartement but we can make it work, you can take my bed and i'll sleep on the couch. 

I see a lot of myself in you buddy. The lack of wanting to live, being betrayed by your parents and your family, struggling in school, weight. But i have some ideas that might help both of us that i haven't done yet. 

If anything, i'd recommend watching ""dr k healthy gamer"". I'm not well still, but i'm doing a little better each day. I recommend starting by watching Reckful's videos (there are 3 of them). If you watch something by him and it clicks with you, i have more resources by him.

If you are feeling very desperate, come with me and let's do mushrooms, even if it's just a 2-3 day visit. Or i can come to you. That sounds fucked up sure, but at a point of desperation, i'd try. I've heard massive success stories with severely depressed people (there are reports on reddit, let me know if i should find some for you).

Lastly, if i were to chose between me dying and you dying, i'd chose myself. The best friends i've ever had were other depressed people because we connected so well, on multiple levels. Unfortunately most of them let me down big time. I don't wish them bad still, and i'd still give my life for them. I would like to hand you all my love and let you let me down if that is the case, and i wouldn't resent you for it."

tinnitus,fcyfsri,t1_fcy0hpb,1578079493.0,Fellow AuD here. Thank you for sharing this info better than i conveyed in my state of anger after reading the part about homeopathy (pseudoscience fires me up haha).
tinnitus,fcyenhp,t1_fcwrafi,1578078990.0,"FYI, the lymps around the ear have no connection, directly or indirectly, to the middle ear. So you might be feeling fluids going down but they have no relation to the middle ear."
tinnitus,fcydu5c,t1_fcyb6xf,1578078586.0,"Doctors aren't at all infallible, yet believing that one is better versed in health as opposed to someone with 6+ years of education including many years of experience is potentially a dangerous train of thought. 

In regards to the food pyramid, it dates back to 1974 i believe. Firstly, general diet isn't the field for a GP or doctor, it's work for dietitians. The food pyramid was published by US Department of Agriculture, not any medical society. If you spoke to a dietitian with a valid education, they would tell you that the health pyramid is humbug, and as you stated, is almost the exact opposite. I challenge you to give me an actual example of where the medical community is wrong and NOT based on some pseudo-scientific or anecdotal grounds. 

We can agree to disagree on homeopathy but the simple fact is that it is pseudoscience and no, and i repeat *no* peer reviewed study has found any significant benefit from homeopathic treatment in any illness.

EDIT: I want to add that treating sinus congestion CAN relieve tinnitus, but only works for someone who actually has congested sinuses. However, bearing your theory in mind, it wouldn't actually do anything for any dried out clumps of mucus. Claiming that you theory can be applied to most T sufferers is dead wrong. And i've worked in the field for a while. If you want anecdotal evidence, of the potentially hundreds of people who i've seen with T who coincidentally were also congested at the time, around half of them used sinus decongestants, yet none ever said anything about their T."
tinnitus,fcy11ed,t3_ej5rae,1578073262.0,"I know this will be downvoted but i want to make a comment regarding this post. You don't have to agree but bear this stuff in mind coming from an audiologst.

First of all, yes doctors and ENT's will mostly be useless regarding T because there is no accepted medical treatment for T, so any hate directed at them isn't justified, you can't hate on a doctor for not being able to cure Crohn's disease either. 

Secondly, i see why you'd think there's a chance mucus might cause T. However, how would a random clump of dried mucus cause T? That clump wouldn't affect the middle ear pressure (tympanometry), nor would it affect the ear drum, since such an anomaly would be clearly visible looking at the ear drum (otoscopy). If you think it could affect the pressure though, request a tympanometry, it would show an irregular measurement. There's no correlation with T affecting middle ear pressure or vice versa.

All remedies that worked for you listed, would do absolutely nothing for dried mucus in the ear, i don't know if i have to clarify this one however tell me if you'd want clarification.

Going on a keto diet is something you recommend, yet an increase in ketones has been linked with decreasing T because of the effects it has on neuroinflammation, not dried mucus in the ear. 

Homeopathy is proven humbug, pseudoscience at it's finest.

> > The fact that I've responded so well to these treatments for ETD seems to validate my self-diagnosis

Have you heard of confirmation bias? Placebo?


I think people on this sub, including op, should be wary of trying to discover a new pathology to T. After all, scientists and doctors have been trying to find out the pathology for decades now, something as simple as dried mucus wouldn't have gone unnoticed. 

The reason it worked for you can range from placebo to undiagnosed ETD, and i'm glad you can find relief, but please don't claim that you have found out the cause and that most people who suffer from T suffer from the same cause, it seems very disrespectful to the community and the researchers.

Stuff i missed: If you've been diagnosed with Meniers, how can you be so sure you don't have it? Do you have symptoms to support such a diagnosis? The video you linked would not affect dried mucus in the ear in the slightest, the lymphs surrounding the ear are in no way connected to sinuses that could affect the middle ear. I'll praise the post for staying away from benzos but that's about it. Also, there are many more causes for T than the 5 you list in the beginning. 

Feel free to ask questions, i'd be happy to steer anyone away from pseudoscientific claims with facts."
AskReddit,fcx9t1d,t3_ej7pm7,1578056719.0,"Dzhan/Soul by Andrei Platonov. During his lifetime most of his works were banned under the rule of the USSR. The book was reissued in 2007 with an english translation and it's one of the most profound books i've read.

Stoner by John Williams. So dark, yet with the most beautiful glimpses of beauty i've experienced in any format. *""To W.S.""*. It's one of those books that make you think about it long after you've read it.

Metamorphosis by Kafka. Just wow. Everyone should read at least one work of Kafka and i think this one is the easiest, maybe save for The Judgement. There's a reason it's considered a classic.

Invisible - City of Glass - The locked Room, all by Paul Auster. Most people sleep on Mr Austers' works, perhaps they just click with me but i've never read any other author who can keep me thrilled, hopeful and depressed as much as Auster can continuously. He captures and conveys every emotion perfectly and even the most sorrowful stories make you wish that you were the protagonist, can't praise him enough."
AskReddit,fcx8kms,t1_fcwa1cr,1578055489.0,I'm delightfully surprised to see this one here as i thought it was a pretty obscure book. Each of the patients stories are seriously interesting yet sad. Good choice!
tinnitus,fcr6era,t1_fcp7meo,1577897459.0,"Tinnitus is complicated, mainly because many different things can cause tinnitus. I want to make a very clear way of diagnosing. Hypothetically, doing EMG's for on kind of tinnitus, and if that doesn't show any results, doing blowork and so on. Afterwards, you can look into what causes tinnitus in each of these cases. Once you know the very cause, you can work on a treatment towards alleviating the T. 

Many people on here will have to resort to alternative medication that promises lower neuroinflammation, thus lowering the T. Yet some of those will have no use from that because neuroinflammation was never the cause. Even after seeing a professional, you are left to take measures on your own. This is because there is no clear guidelines as to how to treat T, and this i have seen in coworkers etc.

I'm kinda mixing in a lot of thoughts i have on the matter, but basically, we need to find every cause for tinnitus (pathology), we need to find a way to diagnose the cause with ease clinically and then find out how to treat it.

If this doesn't make sense i'll try to put a little extra effort to the comment :)"

tinnitus,fcmnggy,t1_fclcrdy,1577782906.0,"There currently is no such thing. I'm becoming an audiologist, who's primary area of interest is tinnitus along with a handful of other conditions."
tinnitus,fcjuk1w,t3_ehhe6u,1577705448.0,"As someone who's making a career in the field, i'd say with almost certainty, not within 5 years. There's been some recent development in understanding the mechanisms in play which can potentially be what leads to a treatment. What needs to happen from a scientific standpoint first though, is testing similar treatments in animal studies, trials on humans, assessing risk vs benefit etc. 

My bet is, there will be a treatment in the form of a neuroinflammatory blocker, perhaps in 6-10 years time, but this depends on how much interest is shown in finding a treatment. The benefits of the potential treatment can range from very mildly alleviating symptoms to clearing all symptoms. I sure hope T sufferers can congregate a major presence and urge politicians and researchers to further research. Let them know how much of a burden T can be."

tinnitus,fbyn36b,t1_fbxk4t7,1577221120.0,I'm not based in the UK or US but do see the ENT first. I'd recommend seeing an audiologist and tell him/her what you hope to get out of it on a cheap budget. In theory even cheap ones should work well but you might miss out on masking features depending on the brand of hearing aids. I hope the audiologist can clarify!
