AskReddit,fdre3uh,t1_fdql64o,1578683161.0,"See, there was this group of 100 monks, and they decided to build a fantastic cathedral. They started building, and got people from the congregation involved, and in a years time, they were done. While the monks stood admiring their handy work, a guy on a bike rode by and tossed a stick of dynamite into the cathedral. The monks scrambled to try and save the building, but they were too late. The dynamite exploded, destroying the cathedral and taking half the monks with it. 

After an appropriate period of mourning for their brothers, the 50 monks decided that rebuilding the cathedral would be the best way to honor their legacy. The work was hard without so many of their brothers, and while many congregation members did help, others were still too poor from the last time. Nevertheless, after 2 years of hard work, the cathedral was done. As they stood back to take a breath, the same guy on a bike rode by and tossed another stick of dynamite into the cathedral. The monks once again tried to save the cathedral, but it was too late. The cathedral went down, taking half the order with it. 

After another mourning period slightly shorter than the last, the 25 monks took a vote, and unanimously decided to rebuild the cathedral. Most of their building experts had been lost in the previous explosions, and only a scant few congregation members were willing to help. After 4 years of difficult work, they were finished. As the dust settled, the same guy on a bike rode by and tossed a stick of dynamite into the cathedral. The monks were frozen in outrage, and the cathedral came down, taking half the order plus one.

After the shortest mourning period their order would allow, the 12 monks agreed for various reasons to rebuild the cathedral. They had lost many of their best workers, and this time, the congregation members refused to help them. 8 years of back breaking labor later, the cathedral was finally done. The monks looked around wearily for any signs of oncoming destruction, and as if on cue, the guy on the bike rode by and tossed a stick of dynamite onto the cathedral. Enraged, the monks shouted for the police, but the cathedral came down, taking half the order with it. 

The 6 monks, still steaming at the insult, began rebuilding as soon as the letter of special dispensation from the head of their order came. With only six men, the work moved at a snails pace, and their suppliers from the community refused to sell them the tools they needed. Still, after 16 excruciating years, the cathedral was finally done. The 6 monks laid down to nonviolently stop the guy on the bike, but he simply jumped over them, tossed a stick of dynamite onto the cathedral, and rode away. The cathedral came down before the monks could stand up, taking half the order with it.

The 3 remaining monks, too angry to mourn, began rebuilding the very next day. It would take 3 men a long time to do anything on this scale, and it did not help that the head of their order excommunicated them for their stubbornness, removing their funding and outside support. Nevertheless, after 32 years of hellish labor, the cathedral was done. Seeing as how they’d been excommunicated anyway, the monks had laid pikes in front of the cathedral, but the guy on the bike simple rode around them, tossed a stick of dynamite onto the cathedral, and rode away. Trapped by their own spikes, the monks could only watch as the cathedral came down, taking two with it. 

The final monk, as it just so happens, had been a professional bike racer before he joined the order. Fueled by an insurmountable rage, he grabbed a bike off a nearby bike rack, breaking the chain with his bare hands. While he was a little rusty from so many years without practice, muscle memory soon kicked in, and he rode like a man half his age. The guy on the bike led the final monk on a spectacular chase, weaving in and out of traffic, jumping over pedestrians, and even going through a mall. Despite the guy on the bike’s skill, it was clear that the final monk was just too fast for him. The final monk closed in on him on the outskirts of town, on a road famous for its neglect by the city. The final monk was a hairs breath away from grabbing the guy on the bike, so focused on the end, that he didn’t notice the giant pothole. The monk crashed into the hole, cracking his head open on the pavement and dying instantly.

My #1 priority would be to get a member of leadership on your side. Most adult leaders/volunteers are eager to try and make these experiences as excellent and as smooth as possible. A good leader will help you when you start to feel overwhelmed, either by providing you with a place to take a breather or removing the problem all together.

My second piece of advice is the same for fashion- accessorize! While you can’t be 100% in control of your environment, having a few useful items can make a situation feel a bit more tolerable. My must haves are headphones (either regular which are cheaper or noise canceling, which are more affective), a stim toy/item (I personally like jewelry like necklaces and rings that I can fiddle with, but fidget spinners, stressballs, and other stuff work too), zipper jacket (easy to put on if you want some pressure or take off if you’re feeling hot). You can add other items like blankets, music, earplugs, and sunglasses depending on your mood

As for socializing... well, that’s why we’re all here, isn’t it. The people on your trip are there to connect to their heritage and to meet fellow members of your group. That means you’ve got a built in conversation starter. I know it’s super anxiety inducing to speak to a stranger, but sharing an observation or an opinion with the person next you can often lead to a friendship. Finally, I know it’s an little uncouth, but don’t be afraid to eavesdrop! People LOVE sharing topics they’re interested in with others, no matter if they’re a stranger. If you find a group talking about something you like or know a lot about, a simple ‘hey, excuse me, I heard to talking about X, and I though (insert opinion, cool fact here)’ can do wonders for ingratiating yourself in that group

All ‘wwiii’ jokes aside, this will probably end up like the Iraq war, which is also very much not a good thing.
