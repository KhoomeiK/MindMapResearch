But yeah. One of the wonders of growing up is I keep realizing all these rules in Danish grammar that no one ever told me. Like, *oh so I guess you always pronounce g as a j after E and A!* It's just intuitive to me, like you say."
todayilearned,fdqz4t0,t1_fdqttdn,1578677171.0,"Well it depends on your particular variant of English. Americans and Canadians mostly pronounce ""then"" and ""than"" the same. Scottish people don't. Some English people don't."

sports,fdqoaok,t1_fdqmy16,1578671325.0,"I had a feeling that's what was going on, to be honest. No worries.

You're right. It would be more accurate of me to have said ""consequences"", not repercussions. I can't speak on behalf of the OP, but it seems to me that's what they meant as well, since definitionally you can't intend unintended consequences. So the sentiment I engaged with was - in my mind - ""the point of protest is to cause a reaction, and you understand that reaction might be severe"". When you chain yourself to a building, you understand what's gonna happen is there will be images of the police removing you. And that's the protest image. Not you being chained to a building.  It's not that they *risk* being arrested and removed. That is in fact the point, I'd argue. But of course the larger goal is something else.

With respect to the Suffragettes and my Emily Davison example, I would've used her death as an example where negative consequences might have been the point - though that's still hotly debated  by historians, I've since learned..

Anyways, it's Friday, it's all good. I don't feel too strongly about this argument either way."
sports,fdqm1da,t1_fdqksq9,1578669881.0,"So is one of my degrees, incidentally. The reason I ask is that you'd think bringing up the lexical definition would be your *first* argument, when your case literally has to do with intent.  

I mean, heavens, there's nothing wrong with googling to find a better argument. :)  No need to get defensive. Part me was also just poking a bit fun at your coming into this thread at an 11 with cursived emphasis and indignation. I almost made my reply about the protest tactics of Emily Davison, but then thought a gentle ribbing might exhaust me less.

Please proceed, Govenor.

EDIT: Didn't see your edits. Well, yeah of course I googled the word! The difference between the two of us is I'm not ashamed of looking something up.

Imagine a language where the article before a noun (sort of equivalent of your a and an) had no general rule for when to use which. Imagine you just had to learn which article goes with EVERY SINGLE WORD IN THE LANGUAGE. And every time you make a mistake, people will know you're a foreigner.

Imagine a language where Ds are pronounced hard at the beginning of a word, soft between vowels, and silent when they appear after Ls and Rs. And also before Ss.

Imagine a language so fucked that they looked at the way the French count numbers and went ""eh, not complicated enough."""
todayilearned,fdqfrgn,t1_fdqb5g9,1578665543.0,"I'm of course not saying that many or most Native speakers of English make this mistake. SImply that when the mistake occurs, 9 times out of ten it's made by a native speaker.

Non-native speakers have their own variety of mistakes, that's usually completely contingent on their first language.

I've noticed some Spanish speakers tend to have trouble with the conjugation in a sentence like ""I didn't see it.""

I often see them say ""I didn't saw it."" Because in their minds 'saw' is past-tense, and they're speaking about the past so it's intuitive that the verb should be conjugated in past tense. English's invention of that little word ""do"" is a huge source of grammar mistakes by ESL speakers from other indo-european languages."
todayilearned,fdqf9vv,t1_fdqdnjq,1578665173.0,"It's not really wrong. It's just an aphonetic trait of English. That sometimes vowels are not pronounced the way they're supposed to be pronounced.

todayilearned,fdqea0w,t1_fdq74sf,1578664402.0,"Well, in Denmark high school is a bit more advanced than in the US. It doesn't start until Grade 11, and ends at Grade 13. If you have abysmal grades you won't be able to get into a conventional high school.

We have several kinds.

General High school (what most people do, and which is generally academic)

Technical High School (the stereotype is these are the people with bad grades in conventional subjects)

Business High School (Bit of column A, bit of column B)

So if you just could not speak English at the expected level, you would probably attend one of the other high schools."
sports,fdq4d2i,t1_fdpoge6,1578654263.0,"I mean. Most successful protests in history aimed to have - and did have - repercussions. Women didn't get the right to vote by a bunch of people holding up witty signs. (Nothing against witty signs).

A successful protest is one you can't ignore. One that forces the culture you live in to reflect and have a conversation."
todayilearned,fdq3s9i,t1_fdq1j9d,1578653466.0,"When I was a kid in Denmark in the late 90s, it was more conversational than grammar, as I recall. Once you reach high school all English classes are entirely in English.

One of the interesting things I found, however, was that native speakers of English made mistakes that most non-native speakers would never make.

Like confusing ""then"" and ""than"". This is a mistake you only make if you learn to speak a language way before learning to write it. Non-native speakers would tend to pronounce to vowel sounds differently, whereas native speakers (especially North American variants) tend to pronounce both vowels the same in conversational English."
PoliticalDiscussion,fdf8jhz,t1_fdf85s5,1578355794.0,"That was certainly part of it, but I'm paraphrasing one of the chapters in Jason Stanley's book ""How Fascism Works"" where he talks about the ahistorical component to the 'mythical past'. I can't find the exact quote I'm looking for, but he sort of covers it tangentially in this quote as well:

> “Mussolini makes clear that the fascist mythic past is intentionally mythical. The function of the mythic past, in fascist politics, is to harness the emotion of nostalgia to the central tenets of fascist ideology—authoritarianism, hierarchy, purity, and struggle.”"
politics,fdexnkx,t1_fde9a64,1578348778.0,"We just got two new far right parties in Denmark (further right than the Danish People's Party). One called De Nye Borgerlige (The New Right) is a openly white supremacist party with good branding whose leader is this [blonde, blue-eyed woman](https://jyllands-posten.dk/pictures/image/11427722/o7u0me/ALTERNATES/h-5_3/folketingsvalg2019).

They barely got into parliament with 2.5% of the vote. Votes they stole from the Danish People's Party who went from 18% to barely 11%. Another far right party styled around a Trumpian 'every man' who literally campaigned on throwing all muslims out of Denmark didn't get enough votes to get into to parliament.

But because his antics were so outrageous he made the well-branded white supremacist party look serious and mainstream.

Between the Danish People's Party and the New Right the far-right section of Danish politics is at about 13.5%. Which is way, way, way too much. But I should say that  while they are both racist parties, the label 'fascist' might be a bit too broadly applied here.

While I would argue that all the fascists in Denmark vote either The Danish People's Party, The New Right or fringe candidates like the one I mentioned, not everyone who votes for these parties are fascists. In fact, very few probably are. It's a spectrum. Some are 'just' racist. or 'just' islamophobic. Or 'just' xenophobic. Most 'just' want to close the borders or make it harder for immigrants to come to Denmark. But not, you know, murder them or throw existing immigrants out of the country. That is still a very, very small percentage of the overall population, I'd argue.

Anecdotally, I am Danish myself but I have relatives in North Dakota who have never been to Denmark or speaks a word of Danish - but can't shut up about their ""Danish blood"" and ""Danish genes"". They all voted Trump. So, you know, just saying, I wouldn't put it past someone like that to put the flag of their 'blood line' on reddit, rather than where they actually live, you know?"
PoliticalDiscussion,fdeuyqb,t1_fdec2sy,1578347144.0,"True. It exempts the leader from subordination and faceless conformation to the fascist state, because it many respects - to paraphrase Louis the XIV's despotic evergreen - the leader *is* the state. His individual is what fascism asks its subjects to put before themselves. 

There's obviously also the fascists' more than earnest fascination with social Darwinism which they saw as the best metric for separating the heroic people from the non-heroic."
PoliticalDiscussion,fdd9oj5,t1_fdczjza,1578301361.0,"It's not all it takes. And it's not *just* the way things were 'before'. It's a mythical, intangible 'before'. Someone saying ""let's return to the America of Clinton's 90s or Reagan's 80s!"" is not espousing a fascist sentiment. Fascism purposefully never locates its mythic past with any sort of clear specificity. It's just...you know...back when things were great. If that to you means the 1950s, cool. If it means the 1850s, cooler.

Mussolini himself supposedly admitted that this mythical past was to be fabricated. It was a political tool to organize the masses around, not an actual time the country had lived through. It was an ideal, a utopia. That never actually existed.

That's why people often ask Trump supporters the question ""when exactly was America great and when did it stop being great?""."
PoliticalDiscussion,fdd98dh,t1_fdcpe25,1578300701.0,"I think the word 'fascistic' is far more useful to describe some of the - in the words of Paxton - less 'authentically fascist' regimes you describe. Franco, for instance, was brought to power with the aid of an outright fascist party (La Falange) but his rule was characterized far more by a militaristic and catholic authoritarianism than revolutionary totalitarianism.

> after all, should we expect a nation of several hundred ethnicities to be unified ethnically (Indonesia) or expect a traditionally catholic country to unshakle itself from its religious traditions (Spain)? 

Mussolini did in the traditionally catholic country of Italy, so perhaps? But again, I think it's a bit simplistic to reduce Franco's exemption from outright fascism to simply his catholicism. As I mentioned, he seemed less interested in the inherently revolutionary project of fascism and the totalitarianism it asks for, than simply establishing a traditional military dictatorship.

>Conservatism cannot be held, in all times and all places, to be against women recieving the vote, or upholding capitalism, or disliking gay people, because conservatism is defined in relation to the status quo. So, too, should we contextualise fascism. 

I agree that it's not the most useful thing to disqualify any fascism that doesn't look *exactly* the one in Weimar Germany or Post WW1 Italy. Context matters, but we should be able to clearly delineate the differences in category between fascism and simply a reactionary dictatorship.

And one of the most useful ways to do that, in my opinion is to look at how a government justifies itself. Fascism relies on mass politics and populism, and seeks to integrate every citizen into the fascistic project - much like a cult. That's its totalitarianism. It looks to the mythical past to vindicate itself, it's extremely anti-individualist and extremely hierarchical.  And it seeks to 'hard reset' the political machine, or at least couches its rhetoric in quasi-revolutionary language (""drain the swamp"", ""purify the nation!"").

Putin fits some of those, but not others. 

I tend to agree with Ian Danskin over at Innuendo Studios, that it's more useful to talk about whether a given figure ""does fascism some of the time"" rather than whether they are a capital F Fascist all of the time."
