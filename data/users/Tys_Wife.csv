AmItheAsshole,ffq85cz,t1_ffq7gi6,1580125424.0,Thank you for your input. I really appreciate
AmItheAsshole,ffq7v4j,t1_ffq79al,1580125054.0,Thank you
AmItheAsshole,ffq7tip,t1_ffq77sf,1580124996.0,I agree with you. Thank you for your input!
AmItheAsshole,ffq7olt,t1_ffq1u3a,1580124815.0,"Yes, but nearly every school function gender specific. They had a movie with moms another time. It's just not fair. If they want fathers to get involved, they should request male role models IF POSSIBLE. Not enforce it."
AmItheAsshole,ffq7jb6,t1_ffpzqae,1580124615.0,"Just because they specified Mother - son, Father - Daughter."
AmItheAsshole,ffpz9l8,t1_ffpyz6n,1580112025.0,Wow. I never thought about that.
AmItheAsshole,ffpyu1f,t1_ffpysqg,1580111436.0,I will ask when the school opens. Thank you
AmItheAsshole,ffpyspa,t1_ffpypgy,1580111384.0,"I surely will try, fingers crossed!"
AmItheAsshole,ffpyrx5,t1_ffpyohw,1580111353.0,Thanks. Am calling the school to ask once they open.
AmItheAsshole,ffpyqkl,t1_ffpymb3,1580111301.0,"I wish. But alot of people have said ask and if they say no, go anyway. I think I will be looking for a dress soon."
AmItheAsshole,ffpyirp,t1_ffpy7of,1580111020.0,"My husband, but he's in prison. (Please don't be mean about this, it's really hard)"
AmItheAsshole,ffpyhpn,t1_ffpy5ds,1580110983.0,Wow. I admire your bravery.
AmItheAsshole,ffpy1zt,t1_ffpxw6g,1580110409.0,"Uncles live on the west coast, along with 1 grandad. Other granddad is nearly disabled and wouldnt be able to go. I have no friends so that rules that option out automatically. And the only other male I can think of items my cousin who is 18, and is somewhat of a spoiled brat, so I doubt he would have the time. I doesnt hurt to ask though"
AmItheAsshole,ffpxkt7,t1_ffpx5y7,1580109796.0,"They also have it in place that a classroom visit must be preplanned and preapproved, so I can understand this as well."
AmItheAsshole,ffpxghd,t1_ffpwoj6,1580109643.0,You're right. Will post an edit tomorrow once I have asked them
AmItheAsshole,ffpxe1e,t1_ffpwlx3,1580109561.0,Thank you so much. I really appreciate your kindness. I just might need to beat your eyes up one day with more senseless ranting lol.
AmItheAsshole,ffpx979,t1_ffpwhet,1580109388.0,No problem. I value your input nonetheless.
AmItheAsshole,ffpx27e,t1_ffpwj8m,1580109142.0,Thank you for your input. Unfortunately I don't have specific contact info for the staff. I will call the school tomorrow and ask the principal if I would be able to go instead of dad. Check back in about 8 hours for the edit.
AmItheAsshole,ffpwzh2,t1_ffpw7cd,1580109049.0,"Don't usually say no to school events, but more so expensive toys and trips I cant afford. In fact, she goes to an after school program every Wednesday that is teaching her Karate. Had to leave work early one day to ensure she got her spot in the program. Thanks for your input, will add an edit once I have called the school."
AmItheAsshole,ffpwujl,t3_euk9if,1580108879.0,"Nope, haven't talked to the school, but will add an edit when I do. Thanks for your input."
AmItheAsshole,ffpwspa,t1_ffpw9l9,1580108815.0,Lol
AmItheAsshole,ffpwrx0,t1_ffpw2bc,1580108787.0,"I haven't asked them yet, but I will call tomorrow and see what they say... will add an edit as to what took place."
AmItheAsshole,ffpwpu2,t1_ffpw1m4,1580108719.0,":') truly got tears out of me, thanks for the compliment.  The only grandfather close enough is not strong enough to go. My brothers live on the west coast, and the only cousin I could ask is a spoiled selfish angry POS. He grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth so I'm sure he'd be busy that night, but it wouldnt hurt to ask him."
AmItheAsshole,ffpwhgv,t1_ffpvz1m,1580108446.0,"Daaaaang, I never thought of it that way. Thanks a bunch!"
AmItheAsshole,ffpwg27,t1_ffpvy9k,1580108401.0,Well my kids ask for stuff all the time like new toys or trips that I cant afford. So naturally it's usually no.
AmItheAsshole,ffpwefq,t1_ffpvxpu,1580108347.0,"Really good idea. I may ask, just cuz she really wanted to go to this dance, as it would be her first."
AmItheAsshole,ffpwcaj,t1_ffpvx9i,1580108274.0,"Thank you, that's how I feel"
AmItheAsshole,ffpwbsn,t1_ffpvvyw,1580108258.0,"Nah, I feel like it's a losing battle. They are really stupid when it comes to reasoning with them."
AmItheAsshole,ffpw9xa,t1_ffpvvpy,1580108198.0,"I'm sure they would. They make a really big deal anytime I try and get involved with my kids at school. For example, the other day I came to school to eat lunch with my 5 year old and the office lady asked if I asked the teacher if I could come first. I said yes and she asked if I spoke to the teacher today. I said I already asked the teacher and she didnt have a problem with it. Again, she asked if that conversation took place today, and I said Yes. I was pissed that time."
intermittentfasting,ffprboc,t1_ffpqfep,1580102944.0,"Maybe introduce calorie counting, and perhaps 30 minutes of cardio 5 days a week? MyFirnessPal is really good at calculating the amount of calories you need to stay under in a day to reach your goal weight. It also counts your calories burned from exercise to allow more food, if that is what you want."
