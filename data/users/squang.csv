aww,fef72r9,t1_feey2wu,1579049722.0,I've got support fam thanks for the blessing. I'm very well off just a addict/in somewhat of a recovery lol.
aww,feevngi,t1_feev5ph,1579042196.0,"Yea well pharmaceutical companies, lack of Healthcare etc contribute and these professionals make big bucks.

Even my detox/rehab was poorly run and they must've made great money, doing the same things in rehab EVERY week"
aww,feeuicd,t1_fedqpft,1579041495.0,"Take it from an addict, nobody cares what you call us, but there are those that give up and accept the label of addict forever and those still addicted trying to make progress. But genuinely nobody cares.

I already hit rock bottom and am floating up, but Id have no qualms about being called an addict still. It's a personal journey to heal."

phenibut,fdbuvie,t3_eki3qp,1578262341.0,"I cold turkeyed 10g of pheni a few weeks ago, even at that dose no effects due to tolerance. And I had tried ghb while dependant on phenibut, and didn't do much. They have a cross tolerance so now ghb works for me well.

Phenibut lasts so long that even dosing every morning is kinda like a redose, and tolerance skyrockets."

ThoseInNeed,fcrppua,t3_eilyi1,1577904964.0,I am in the same place but have basically cut off most friends because of isolation and anxiety. Just dropped out of college.. Hope this year is better and I won't end up in rehab again.

quittingphenibut,fcm33d5,t3_ehp605,1577762972.0,"Maybe try to stretch the time between doses farther, overall less in your system than then."
quittingphenibut,fcm2vf4,t3_eho9b7,1577762806.0,"If you don't have tolerance to gabapentin or baclofen, I'd say it's safe to cut maybe a third or so of the phenibut off while taking the other two. But expect to still feel some strong withdrawl."
quittingphenibut,fcm25gv,t3_ehwx76,1577762263.0,The jolting thing can happen naturally I think. And I quit kratom just over a week ago as well! Haha
quittingphenibut,fcm219i,t3_ehwx76,1577762177.0,"I cold turkeyed at least a 10gpd habit 3 days ago. My third time in withdrawl from it. I can't sleep at all unless I load up on other meds/drugs, but even then it's such light and short sleep that I don't notice it."

Benzedrex,fb6oyw3,t1_fb6ivu3,1576555836.0,"Hell yea. 14B is pretty good. I used it 24/7 for months and it stopped working, so I quit, no withdrawls. My tolerance is still high though."
