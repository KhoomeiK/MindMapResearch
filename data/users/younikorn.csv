worldnews,fek6udz,t1_fek5ul3,1579193827.0,"I agree with your rethoric on the consequences of those conflicts but i doubt those conflicts would take place randomly. You shouldn't forget that 9/11 happened after the US already had active troops in the middle east. Pearl harbor also didn't happen randomly since the US was already active in asia with their colonies and forcing Japan to open up and accept more trade deals with the US which led to a change in power in Japan towards a regime that was more opposed to weatern interference. Ww2 was mostly an aftershock of things that were set in motion by ww1 and the period before that. Had ww1 not happened ww2 would have been a lot less likely to happen as well. So all in all the reason the US got into those conflicts was again a result of the US being overactive in their foreign playing field.

I know that we can't pull back easily, you can't quit in the middle of a fight after throwing a punch and say ""hey, lets not fight anymore"". But we should have an exit strategy, nothing good comes from staying there so we should work towards a solution where we can leave them to their own devices indefinitely, and that won't happen if we just keep on bullying weaker countries. Eventually Iran will poses nukes, just like north korea, precisely because we have shown that we only respectfully negotiate with countries that have nukes. The more we threat Iran the more they feel the pressure to have nukes."

Another option ofcourse could be to maybe just ignore that part of the world, the only reason we care about iran is in order to protect the things we depend on in the region, mainly oil. So how about we invest in renewable energy sources and let the middle east fight it out with themselves? There is no reason why we should commit warcrimes to fix someone elses problems, we're not the global police and we shouldn't try to be the global police. Why can't we just be like sweden or switzerland and stay neutral, stay in our own lane, and not antagonize half the world."

Smart and healthy people are less likely to fall for populists amd extremists and eventually more moderate people will get into power who wouldn't want to use nukes even if they had them.

In the west the main reason we now have a clear distinctiom between church and state (most countries at least), is because of the large relatively well educated middle class. All the nationbuilding that the first world and the second world have tried was always doomed to fail bevause everytime governments focussed on putting puppet governments into power or demanding compliance using a show of arms.

The part that i was reacting about was your reasoning that because it happens less often that mothers ditch their kids it must mean that she was mentally ill. That argument is flawed because you fail to prove that the smaller portion of women who leave their families are mostly mentally ill.

In your argument it doesn't matter that she is a woman because your comparison is about healthy women versus mentally ill women. What you should prove isn't that women leave their kids less frequently than men but that mentally ill people leave their kids more often.

This would change your argument from:

 ""she isa woman that left her kids, thus she is mentally ill"" 

to:

 ""she was known to be mentally ill and left her kids, mentally people often leave their families, thus her mental illness must have played a role""

And that latter argument is based on the assumption that mentally ill people leave their kids more often which is something you would need to back up with actual sources.

That is why i said your reasoning was flawed, i never discussed the mental state of this woman in particular."

Now i do agree that iran hands is responsible, however all intelligence agencies world wide have agreed that it wasn't a planned attack but human error. One person who was on edge and thought he was saving his country.

The US on the other hand has done nothing but worsen the situation in the middle east for the past couple years, and the only problems they (partially) solved were problems they themselves started. They have antagonized iran and ruined all the progress the previous administration made in bringing them to the table on good terms.

Althouh i hate the idea of Turkey, Russia, or China spreading it's influence in the middle east i think it's time that the west pulls back and accepts the fact that they can't be friends with everyone.

It's probably just a matter of ""you fucked up and you noticed too late"" and it's the latter part that led to this debacld. It sucks but i don't think they're in the wrong here, their patience just ran out after you didn't seem to understand that they realise what happened but thought it didn't deserve their intervention."
