YouShouldKnow,fdlae8f,t1_fdl81hi,1578519834.0,It's not ever safe to speed... that's why it's against the law. A cop speeding doesn't suddenly make it safe. Nor does it make it entrapment.
YouShouldKnow,fdl48wg,t1_fdl2vx1,1578516782.0,"A typical entrapment scenario arises when law enforcement officers use coercion and other overbearing tactics to induce someone to commit a crime. You're thinking opportunity.

YouShouldKnow,fdl28kc,t1_fdkim3y,1578515805.0,Never said the cop was or wasn't breaking the law. But police speeding is not entrapment.
YouShouldKnow,fdl10f7,t1_fdkk23d,1578515159.0,"Which is irrelevant, because the cop is speeding you don't have the right to speed. That doesn't mean it's entrapment."
YouShouldKnow,fdkhuxg,t1_fdkcpv7,1578504176.0,"It's not entrapment at all. Just because the car in front of you is speeding doesn't mean it's okay for you to speed.
The cop could have a code 2. Cop speeding is not permission to speed."
