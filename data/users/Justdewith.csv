AskReddit,ff6274r,t3_ero8mj,1579617256.0,"I was depressed when I was 13 and now as 21 I still haven't become much better. She would be jealous of my computer tho but that's all, I think. Pretty sad about the things thats about to come. And worried about school way more then I was. (I didn't understand how high-school worked at the time) probably wondered why I still haven't found what my meaning of life is. And just the usual stuff most people say."
Excoriation,fema92j,t3_epg82v,1579245689.0,Hmm don't think this is the sub for you but maybe it's a type of ocd? Is there any way for you to talk to a therapist?
depression,fema050,t3_epmgz5,1579245375.0,It's just gonna escelate aswell. It sure sucks :/
depression,fem9z5y,t1_fekbm7i,1579245343.0,"Wait, what?! I live south of Sweden so I guess I can expect it to bloom soon here too then :("
depression,fe7hg8n,t3_enrs4c,1578914512.0,"I can talk about it, I cry alot when I do. But yes it does feel like lying. Even tho it isn't. I have lots of compulsive thoughts of hurting and/or killing myself. They come both when Im alone and with people. They are quite vivid aswell. Almost as I can feel it. I have 3-4 places that feels like it burns. Almost as if my body is trying to tell me where to cut. I don't act out on my thoughts tho. So it truly feels like I'm lying when I say it to my therapist."

depression,fdgftnt,t3_el54zx,1578394849.0,My mind is so blurry that the days are just blending together. I feel like I'm dizzy all the time and as if I'm losing my sight. I feel like I'm dying but I'm not. I'm just waiting for it to happen.

GirlGamers,fcxcq55,t3_ej4yxf,1578059359.0,"I always chose male when I was younger. I hated being female. Cuz I hated feeling weak, being feminine, pink, ponytails. Everything. But as I've grown older I've come to understand more of what it means to be woman. It's what I make it to be. Just a few years ago, I started to choose female more often. It feels good. I still like playing male charakters tho. cuz I like having perspective. And it's only thanks to gaming that it's been possible for me. I'm so greatful."
AskReddit,fcx1d8o,t1_fcvxcv8,1578046860.0,Is it not from when you cook a pig?
mentalhealth,fcuxfnc,t3_ej0v8r,1577990468.0,Like Im depressed and when I feel anxious it turns to self harm thoughts. Usually not acted on. They come like flashes and are involuntary by this point. Kinda sucks.

GirlGamers,fbw2hkc,t1_fbvzlfq,1577139682.0,Well I've been thinking about it. My one problem is that I'm not sure If my computer can handle it. But I'll look in to it. I don't think I can make money of it tho.
