But more specifically on going solo, it's normal to be nervous. But don't be and I know it's easier said then done. However, you have to just be free and enjoy the moment. You will have a fun time enjoying the music and positive vibes. And trust me you will find chill people. Also, I've been going to raves solo a lot and it gets easier and easier. I'll be going to countdown solotoo bcuz I got to see porter Robinson. Hope to see you there friend."
aves,fco13cx,t3_ei7kw0,1577822183.0,"Personally, I'm choosing Jai Wolf to get prepared for Porter.

aves,fcntwhm,t3_ei64mu,1577818329.0,"My advice would be have extra gum and ask if anyone around you wants gum.

Compliment them. For example: I love your makeup! I love your outfit! I love your positive vibes!

Or even bringing a fan and fanning them because it's going to be hot inside.

Then you just spark a conversation about anything: How you feeling? Holy shit \*insert DJs name\* is good! I can't believe it's going to be 2020.

Trust me. You will be just fine and find chill people there. I go to raves solo a lot and I always make friends. Speaking of which, I am going to countdown solo.

EDIT: Just be yourself :) Another thing to note is that don't be discouraged if certain people or group are off putting because it can happen for various reasons. Don't let that bring you down. Just move to the next group and you are bound to find a positive group. You have to break out of your shell!"

electricdaisycarnival,fclflpr,t3_ehojlm,1577746656.0,"I'm sorry that you had to go through that. People need to know that you don't touch anyone without consent especially your butt. There is no excuse even if that person was intoxicated or not, it is just wrong.

I think to avoid this you should go with a group that will surround you and protect you. Kinda sucks that you would need to go through this measure to avoid people touching you. 

I hope this never happens to you or anyone else."

aves,fcl2915,t3_ehrlga,1577738231.0,My experience is that security is really lax. They will pat you and you will go through a metal detector. If you want to hide anything and want to bring it inside for sure then hiding it at the crotch always works. And no from what I've seen they don't check shoes like telling you to take your shoes off or socks off.
aves,fckw1rx,t3_ehcbez,1577734423.0,"I was at audiotistic and I'm going to countdown as well. I wore winter garments inside for both top and bottom. Then wore sweatpants. I wore a shirt over my winter garments and also a thick jacket. If you are outside of the tent it was still freezing. But when you are inside it does get hot so I didn't have to take off my jacket. 
Just make sure to bring warm clothes. I've seen people that dressed up as if it's summer. They were all shaking. I don't recommend that at all because they looked extremely miserable."
