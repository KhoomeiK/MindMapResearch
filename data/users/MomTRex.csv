OP your skin looks great but try Paula's Choice BHA maybe?  I'd have killed for your skin when was your age (only judging by the fact that you have no wrinkles around your mouth)

Parenting,ff7cxio,t1_ff7c948,1579646652.0,"I have a son who can be quick to anger.  I usually just stop whatever I'm doing and just leave the conversation/activity.  I hated having to do this but with my son, once he was on the anger train he couldn't always stop himself.  My husband says it usually occurs if there is something else bothering him and this is just the way to release the anxiety.

Having him do his laundry, or whatever else it is that precipitates his anger is a great idea.  

And therapy, of course.  Since he responds to your husband, but not you, family therapy may be best.  Tell him it is to make it easier for all of you to communicate with one another without anger being involved rather than something about him specifically.

Mine is now in college so it is fingers crossed time for us.  For you there is still time to get it all on track. Good luck!"

Just wait until he is 7 and wants to wear shorts to school when it is 2°F.  Happened with our son (and other boys at school) and rather than let the natural consequences of chapped skin occur, school insisted they wear pants."
atheism,ff7bi11,t3_ery1ay,1579645561.0,"Not an atheist (sorry) but anyone that believes in something that will condemn most of the planet to ""hell"" isn't too bright.  Who said your religion/god/opinion is correct?  The only problem is when those types control the $$ as they seem to now.

I gave on up that whole hell business when my mom transferred me from a public kindergarten to a Catholic first grade.  My bestie in kindergarten was Jewish and now the new school was telling me she was going to hell?  Nope."

CompulsiveSkinPicking,feij0cp,t1_fei5aux,1579139644.0,"My daughter has always had beautiful skin and only really started to pick at it recently (senior year of college stress!). I just wanted to nip it in the bud and help her heal the skin she has picked at and try techniques to help limit her picking.
My husband picks but he has a darker complexion (my daughter and I are very fair) and the damage doesn't really show. He also heals well from his picking despite getting keloids from larger wounds (like when he walked through a plate glass window as a teen).
I picked my face as a child. When I couldn't stop, my dad chopped off my bangs fully exposing my picked, scabby forehead one week before my 4th grade picture day.  Yeah, it didn't do anything but publicly humiliate me and make a permanent lasting memory for all to see in the class photo."

boston,fehrjvr,t3_ep2ki1,1579122459.0,"I saw the original King Tut exhibit when I was in high school in LA in the 70's--it was stunning!

Years later I bought tickets to take my children to see the ""original"" King Tut exhibit at the De Young Museum in San Francisco.  It definitely wasn't the same exhibit that I saw as a teenager, call it King Tut 2.0  So many of the original pieces were not on exhibit.  My husband, who had also seen it as a kid, agreed with me. Talk about disappointing! I believe, but I may be wrong, that it was partially sponsored by the National Geographic Society and it was promoted as the same as was exhibited in the 1970's.

Now, I'm not saying that this soon-to-be visiting exhibit is King Tut or the 2.0 version so I don't know if I'm going to tolerate the hoards going to see it.  But it may be interesting if they do make it immersive if it is only the 2.0 version.  I hope for all the children that it will be the original version!"

That will be another withdrawal as those zaps happen whenever you try to sleep. 
I bet that once you drop your levels again it will just be a short set of zaps and nausea and then finally you'll be free!

antidepressants,fdzt1g9,t3_en6i37,1578795120.0,"I just stopped cold-turkey from 1 yr on 60 mg Cymbalta a week ago ( I ran out on vacation while outside US. Apparently I cannot count).  I was on it for chronic pain.  All I can say is yuck--dizzy, nauseated, diarrhea, sadness, bad dreams--but I don't want to go back on the 30 mg and then taper down so I have to suck it up. 

 I agree with phillyfan49 and suggest a slower schedule for tapering.  Cymbalta has an extremely short half life this means that when you stop taking it, it is out of your system very fast making it feel like a true withdrawal. I'm contemplating going to the local pot shop to help with my symptoms.   This, too, will pass.  Best of luck!"
cymbalta,fdzs7a9,t1_fd8gw69,1578794550.0,Wow!  120 mg?  I was first taking gabapentin (300mg TID) with about 75% pain reduction and then my neurologist add 60 mg of cymbalta.  This gave me 100% relief from the pain of spinal stenosis and I have been able to do more physical therapy and yoga to work on the pain and get stronger.  I just got so tired of the cymbalta side effects I went off it cold-turkey 1 week ago after being on it for 1 year. Hopefully when I finally stop feeling horrible from the withdrawal symptoms I will be able to tolerate the higher pain and stay fit.  Some day I may have to have surgery but such is life.  Good luck to you!
