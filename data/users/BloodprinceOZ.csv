i wouldn't care if i couldn't see very far, if i could get some ""smooth"" terrain like that, even if i can only see like 5% of it, i'd still be able to enjoy myself, because then i can actually make stuff that can properly fit into the terrain, and whatever i can see in my short view will look nice anyways"
saltierthancrait,ffdgfuo,t1_ffd4u0s,1579820341.0,"based on the stuff we've seen of the interaction, they can't actually bring each other to places, but pieces of wherever they are can cross to the other side, like in ROS, Rey is in Ren's chambers and accidently destroys the Vader shrine, parts of which end up where Ren is, which is dirt-side, which lets him know where she is, similar to when Ren destroyed some fruit stand thing and some of the fruit ended up where Rey was.

based on that, if Rey did lift Kylo by his shirt collar or something, its entirely possible that either his entire shirt, or just the piece she's hold would stay with her, and thus be ripped from him. however i don't know if he would collapse, since he'd technically be floating, but its probable that that would happen.

The connection also seems to only affect them, i don't think anybody coming near either of them would register to the other, or even be allowed to be passed to the other side. Maybe limbs would work, similar to the pieces of wherever they're at, but not actual living beings etc, and might apply to objects around them aswell, since objects only passed through to either side when they were accidently in the way of their movements."

EliteMiners,fe1ckdd,t3_enic1k,1578825062.0,"Honestly, ""reddish orange"" is a shit description, its more like a bright gold, or a brighter version of our UI/HUD colours.

generally you have to look for asteroids that are much brighter than asteroids around it, they also have to be a specific shape, so once you've found several, you'll be able to instantly cut off 80% of the false asteroids since they won't be that particular shape you need.

as an aid, use your aim reticles to determine if its actually as bright as it needs to be. usually when its the proper type of asteroid, the glow from the asteroid will completely drown out your reticles (if they are the default colours, otherwise if you change the colour then you'll be losing out on a helpful aid). if you can still see the outline of your reticles then it's probably not the asteroid you want, meaning you can generally go try another one, although if you aren't sure then you can do a little fly-by to check for any fissures, just incase you were wrong, or the glow wasn't registering properly.

i'll try and hop onto the game when i can to capture proper images to help determine proper core asteroids, especially since the ones in the wiki weren't that helpful to me when i first started out opal mining.

also as an aside, depending on how much cargo space you can carry, its better to just fill up your entire hold with limpets, that way you generally won't run out that much, then you can jettison what ever you don't need to gather up any remaining opals. of course this won't help if you're just starting out and you're in a small ship, but its better than nothing really, especially since they're so cheap and you'll get a hefty amount of credits straight away from your first haul"

Most of the fires in NSW would have been caused by lightning strikes, but conditions wouldn't be nearly this bad if climate change didn't exist.

Of course climate change didn't cause these fires, its accelerating them and causing them to burn further and longer, which also isn't aided by the fact that the PM's a fucking dumbass who can't listen to actual firefighters advice and instead wants to suckle the coal industry's asshole as if its the only source of water in a million kilometeres.

sure SOME of the fires might have been caused by fuckwits commiting arson, but i pretty much doubt they were all able to travel around the country to get this to happen to the entire fucking country at once, aswell as somehow being able to prevent rain from hitting the problem areas right?"

raidsecrets,fd968mo,t1_fd91w8p,1578229055.0,"~~if you're talking about the leviathan raid ship then thats actually named after a large creature species called Leviathan on the Homeworld of the Cabal.~~

~~the Leviathan in the Book of Sorrows is also a large creature called Leviathan, but its on the homeworld of Fundament or whatever and as far as we know isn't connected to the ones on the Cabal homeworld, they just happen to have been given similar names by their respective homeworld factions~~

what i'm saying is that just because they have the same ""descriptive"" word doesn't mean they actually are related, especially since its been a couple years since between ENHANCE! being first seen, and the foundation appearing, aswell as the fact that its the fallen vs something primarily covering the Cabal/Vex.~~if there had previously been Cabal or Vex released in the previous season or something that had ""empyrean"" in the name, then sure, they might be connected, but not when its fallen from ages ago from a simple side quest at the beginning of the game.

Empyrean is just a descriptive word, in the case of the fallen, basically equating them to being the strongest possible fallen at that point due to consuming super charged ether. The foundation will most likely cover the Sunbreakers or something related that way since empyrean also describes something being made up of *fire*"

DestinyLore,fd3otxu,t1_fd3k1n4,1578160401.0,"i'm using the word ""fused"" pretty liberally, i mainly mean that it doesn't really matter if the hard-drive itself is damaged directly, if the body itself sustains enough damage, the person will die, along with their consciousness, exactly the same as us humans will even if we're not shot in the head etc"
DestinyLore,fd383me,t1_fd1csb5,1578155662.0,"Banshee doesn't suffer from DER since he can't remember anything, he's basically just a programmed robot with occasional bouts of whatever personality is left from the degredation, there isn't really anything ""telling"" him that he's not supposed to be in the body he's in.

Ada can be argued the exact same way, since according to the BA lore pages she basically didn't know who she was before she woke up as Ada-1 post-collapse, and she doesn't have enough/any memories of actually being human that would cause her to dissaciate with her body (nevermind the fact she might not even be built the same as regular exos which could mean she isn't affected by ""bugs"" such as DER)

DestinyLore,fd370l5,t1_fd24cpr,1578155285.0,"sure but their consciousness itself is constantly degrading aswell, its not as if its actually amnesia, its more like Alzheimers instead, the ""brain"" itself is degrading, which is why Banshee sounds as ""empty"" as he does, he's basically running on whatever fumes his consioucsness has left, which is also why he can barely remember anything beyond his the main points of his job, he's effectively a pre-programmed robot with some inklings of his past and those who've interacted with him.

the Hard-drives themselves degrade, and are basically ""fused"" with the chassis of the body, they're just mechanical humans, they ""die"" just like the rest of organics do, if we take enough damage, no matter if its not in the head or anything that contains our ""conscious"", we can't just take the brain out and toss it into an empty functional meat bag and suddenly work. the only way anyone us escape this death, especially Exos is due to the light being used to bring us back all the time, without it, they'll end up like Cayde if they take enough damage"
