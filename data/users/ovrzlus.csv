iamverysmart,ffgdqxv,t3_eth0rg,1579903971.0,"It's fucken scientifically proven that most of those dinosaurs didn't live at the same time. Dinosaur communities were separated by both time and geography. The 'age of dinosaurs' (the Mesozoic Era) included three consecutive geologic time periods (the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods). Different dinosaur species lived during each of these three periods. For example, the Jurassic dinosaur Stegosaurus had already been extinct for approximately 80 million years before the appearance of the Cretaceous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus. In fact, the time separating Stegosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is greater than the time separating Tyrannosaurus and you. Mammals first burst onto the scene in the cenozoic era and yes there were still dinosaurs around then. They were mostly airborne dinosaurs."

One person said one thing about my wife once and I let him know in no uncertain terms was that acceptable. It never happened again. My point is this. We all have different tolerance levels. When they reach your husband limits he will either say something to them or to you.
