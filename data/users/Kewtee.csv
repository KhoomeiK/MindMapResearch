simracing,femwejm,t3_epnc1a,1579271366.0,"I feel you......  I got my G29 over Christmas, been driving every day since and feel a full rig is the only way to go.  Fortunately my husband shares the passion so the shopping and building has begun.  We decided to stay with the G29 wheel and pedals for now, but have ordered a RSEAT and triple monitors.  I guess this is a rabbit hole and we'll be adding to and improving over time.  I say: Just do it!"

simracing,fd2fgaj,t1_fcyggy4,1578146447.0,Watching my husband.  It's one of those things that looked like so much fun that I couldn't stand being left out any longer.  My only issue was driving with a keyboard.  I like full immersion when playing games.  I was gifted a wheel it changed my life.  I'm hooked and everyone is going hungry............
simracing,fcxidrb,t1_fcxi0wz,1578063688.0,Thanks.  I'll check that out.

simracing,fcxha92,t1_fcvrxkh,1578062902.0,"Well damn!  This has confused me even more......  it appears my default Logitech G29 setup for Forza Horizon 4 is not the same.

These are what I have for example:

x = button 1 

square = button 2 camera

circle = button 3 ebrake

triangle = button 4 rewind

Not sure what they are for Assetto Corsa, Dirt4 or any of my truck simulators because I haven't been through them yet.  My issue is I really wanted to have it consistent across all the sims I have that way I only have to remember one setting.  Are they usually all set up the same?  Or will it require that I do a custom set up to achieve this?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against doing that I just want to know what all the default button designations are so that I can figure this all out.  Currently in the configuration menu the key designations are different to the link you supplied.  Google searches have not been helpful."

simracing,fcvhtnt,t1_fcvfjuc,1578002389.0,"I guess I'm as much of a newb as I thought I was.  It's the G29 that I have, not G27.   Sorry for the confusion......  But I did find the driver and software on that site you linked.  Hopefully I can wade through that and find what I am looking for.
