pokemon,ffnih6k,t3_eu9cms,1580066364.0,Wow! That is so delightful!
bulletjournal,ffecc1j,t3_estyjl,1579842926.0,I love Hollow Knight!
bulletjournal,feyodkd,t1_feyo83v,1579448231.0,"My weeklies are extremely simple, they get decorated as I use them with stickers and notes if I feel the urge."
bulletjournal,feyo83v,t3_eqw2ek,1579448157.0,"It took me a few months to figure out what worked for me. I don't spend much time daily on it, but near the end of the month when I find I have some time I set up my next month. That's when I make my cover, do any trackers I'm using and write in my next weeks. I found if I did too much in advance or had too many trackers, I forgot about them. 

I peek at my weekly periodically in my day to stay on top of my to-do lists, and I've just started trying to maintain a three sentence morning journal."
ottawa,fewa2yv,t3_eqle9q,1579407396.0,I wanted to go to that but the admin fees were way too much
audiodrama,fefti1a,t3_eomo3t,1579064722.0,Okay but the video is just a whole other level on top of that great sound!
ottawa,feaz9du,t1_fea9j6e,1578953797.0,"And if said my councillor was Rick Chiarelli (who I definitely didn't vote for)? But actually, I suppose that is all we can do."
ottawa,fe8tzan,t1_fe8qj3s,1578930803.0,"What should I do to help make our transit better? Not asked in sass, but genuinely. If you have actionable suggestions, please share. I wanted to highlight that OP is preaching to the choir here."
ottawa,fe6jf88,t3_envaf1,1578892841.0,"I mean, you don't have to ride transit anywhere else, people who live in Ottawa know it sucks. We don't have the power to do anything about it though"
bulletjournal,fe5uvt9,t3_envo5a,1578875484.0,"All the beautiful spreads don't leave enough room for me to actually write in, so mine is just headers in each quadrant of the page for each day of the week. I need the full day for Saturday and Sunday, too. It's not very aesthetically interesting, but that does mean I don't get caught up in keeping it looking super fancy, too."
bulletjournal,fe5undl,t3_enquc3,1578875330.0,"My suggestion is to decide what your bullet journal is doing for you. What is its intended purpose? Once you know that, maybe you'll have somewhere to start. Mine is to help me with my daily to-do lists and be a place where I can actually journal, so my weeklies are a mess of scribbles.

I have a few trackers that I use, but some things are better tracked other ways (like I use an app to track my headaches but a page in my journal for weekly spending). I don't use some common pages, either, because they're not useful for me, like the future log. It's not the prettiest, but when the mood strikes I try to put effort into my cover pages or just random drawing pages for my artsy fix, and I managed to use it for all of 2019!"
bulletjournal,fe5u284,t3_enspv1,1578874945.0,That's a great idea!
bulletjournal,fe5twwo,t3_ent73k,1578874847.0,lol lots of my pages look like that too. The 2019 reflection was a big oof
bulletjournal,fe5to0v,t1_fe3rtxw,1578874695.0,"I was going to comment on the post in general and say that I love my sprocket too, but I figured I could share some examples of it in action! Here's a couple pictures I just took of the printouts in my journal [https://imgur.com/a/tt4nN1j](https://imgur.com/a/tt4nN1j) 

I love my sprocket because it's perfect for this specific task. I wouldn't say the print quality is \*good\*, but it's just going in my personal journal so it's good enough for me. And it's so much more convenient for me than getting things printed or setting up a good enough printer at home."
AmItheAsshole,fd9jyr9,t1_fd5kg6o,1578234432.0,"No you weren't, you made it clear in your post that you don't like seeing anyone new come in and try when you mentioned all the people who just quit anyway. You're just using this as an excuse for treating someone that way. 

All the explaining why she was safe won't help, because you don't actually care about that. You just don't like her being there because it annoys you to share what you think of as your space."
bulletjournal,fd6zezd,t3_ejz122,1578197607.0,"I cross stitch too! I've wondered how to record what I make, that's a great idea."
bulletjournal,fabliob,t3_e779p8,1575925035.0,"I've got lots of space left in the one I started last January so I'll keep going! It's got a ton of great stickers on the cover anyway, so it feels like a waste to give up on the book and the decorations so soon."
