If a society has all the tools available to end homelessness. And the amount of homeless persons is rising then something is not done right. The Finnish found they had a harmfull cycle. Then found a way to break the cycle and make it into a healthy upward spiral.

It is all about monitoring the interactions in a society:

* Find the harmfull cycles.
* Find the weak link to break the cycles.
* Get the wanted upward healthy spirals.

I do not think there is single solution to these kind of problems. But i do like the creative thinking of the Finnish people in this regard. Hopefully it inspires other countries to be more creative.

People don't get out of the cycle. So let us try a different approach. This is creative thinking by the Finnish NGO's and government.

On the mental issue / drug use part i can see why that works. All people have the need  for a safe place. Both in the physical world as well as in their head. By giving homeless people a home and thus a safe place. With that new safe place they can get rid of one of the old habits that helped them to feel safe. if guided / support propperly they get into a upward spiral.
