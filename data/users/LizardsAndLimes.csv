Everyone is entitled to respect until they prove to another otherwise, this, this is consistently proving to those you recklessly call ""terfs"" that you aren't deserving of respect. You can't run at someone with a knife shouting ""violent scum"" and then get mad when they fight back."

TrollGC,fclk475,t1_fclj2zz,1577749653.0,"I honestly don't understand the whole ""Nb woman"" thing. I've heard two definitions for nonbinary, 1) being out of the gender binary by not adhering to gender roles, which, shouldn't qualify you as a separate identify at all, especially if you preach abolishing gender roles and 2) essentially being agender where you are not male nor female aligned and are essentially a ""third gender""... 


The community itself can't seem to agree which one it is and somehow the identity falls under being trans. The entire structure of their philosophy falls in on itself regularly. But I kind of understand the more i think about it. Rebecca isnt a scientist, shes not a medical professional, shes a working professional artist with a financial safety net and has never encountered real troubles. And artists see the world in a magical way, especially the rich ones. As an artist she has this need to be ~special~ and wacky and it doesnt surprise me why RB would find it appealing I guess."

Idk.

Maybe it's because I personally stay away from lesbian exclusive places, not on purpose but because- *pretty girls make knees weak, palms sweaty.*"
