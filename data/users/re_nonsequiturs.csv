Look man, you've given it a fair try, still hate it, and you've made your feelings clear to your fiancee and you're still having to come to a group of internet strangers for help.   


If dancing is something that she really loves and it's something you think is idiotic--there's a problem with your relationship that you need to work out preferably before marriage. If you tell her that you absolutely don't want to do something that's meant to be just for fun, after you've given it a chance, and she insists that you've got to do it anyway--there's a problem with your relationship that you need to work out preferably before marriage. This isn't going to just be the wedding, there's going to be other times where she's going to want to be more performative with social rituals and it can't be just you escaping it or suffering through it all the time.  


I mean maybe it'll just be the wedding, but people who want to do big dance routines for their weddings generally want to dance at other times too, so you've really got to consider how much dance you're willing to do and find out from her how much dance she wants to do and talk together about it."
