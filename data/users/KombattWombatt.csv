RocketLeague,fewml88,t3_eqsrpt,1579414788.0,"I am kind of the opposite. I was exclusively ball cam. Started using BOTH about 100 hours ago and it has been a huge boost to my play.

Everton,fesiut3,t1_fesihjv,1579365691.0,I think it might help to remember that he is learning a slightly different CM role than he's used to. Not a whole lot of 21 year olds who can run the engine in the midfield.
Everton,fesikfb,t1_feshlc6,1579365575.0,Dear God I REALLY want...need...him to score the winner. Come on OUMAR!
Everton,fesic3n,t1_feshhll,1579365460.0,Not suggesting giving up on him. Just not sure he's ready to be a regular.
Everton,fesi2q3,t1_feshc94,1579365334.0,"Yup, exactly. The conversation around DCL wasnt the same as the one for Kean. The expectations. That's kind of what I'm getting at... And...DCL offered more when he wasn't scoring than Kean has. Different players. Harder to justify Kean when he looks off the pace, at the moment."
Everton,feshcoq,t1_fesh3dj,1579365128.0,"He's also starting the game, and had a decent amount of time to show us something, and it hasnt happened yet. I'm not saying he's a bust, I'm saying maybe he isn't good enough at this moment."

Everton,feseow7,t1_fese1r8,1579364424.0,"Sneaky good passer. A little suspect on defense sometimes. Since Carlo has arrived, played a bit more like a winger and looked pretty good when he does. Positive. Good character."

Everton,fes5dlc,t1_fes4rl7,1579361568.0,"Eh. ""Created"" is a bit harsh on Richy, no? I didn't mean good moments, I meant complete games. There was a run last season where he looked like the best player on the pitch for the whole game. That's been missing this season."
Everton,fes3zwc,t3_eqh36b,1579361155.0,When was Digne's last good game? A little worried about him lately.
Everton,fes31qx,t1_fes2u5r,1579360926.0,"No, we don't. That's the position I feel we need the most (even more than CM) this window."
Everton,fes2q2i,t3_eqh36b,1579360814.0,"This is not the kind of game for Theo. I like him more than most, but this is the sort of game where we really need someone with composure and guile on the right."

Edit: if this is in the tutorial, just start a game and don't play the tutorial. Learn the other systems like exploration and trading and take easier fights when you can to learn."

reddeadredemption2,febnyr2,t3_eocwl8,1578960883.0,You're talking about the normal dead eye in online. It's the same except doesn't slow down time. Paint it Black. You have to equip cards for your dead eye abilities
Warhammer40k,fe97s9f,t3_eo6rcu,1578935111.0,"Where do you live? All of the gaming stores near me have active Sigmar players. Have you called the one by you and asked when there are normally games, most stores either have a schedule or a general idea of when Sigmar gets played. If you don't have a LGS, then there is an app (forget what it's called but you could Google it) that lets players connect for games. Point being, if you don't mind getting to know new people, if you can find a 40k game then most likely you can find a Sigmar game, so you should try to play whatever gets you most interested in committing to an army"

Everton,fdw57b1,t3_en81d7,1578755207.0,FFS. If you want to cut diving out of the game you HAVE to give that as a penalty. If he falls on his ass its stone-cold. Absolutely ridiculous...
Everton,fdw31mx,t3_en81d7,1578754559.0,"Siggy as captain is the only move Carlo can make if things don't work out for a new cm in this window.
