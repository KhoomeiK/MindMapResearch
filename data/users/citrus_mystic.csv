migraine,ff2uks3,t3_eqx00g,1579524755.0,"My mother and I also both have migraines. She doesn’t make fun of me but she does sometimes turn it into a competition. So if I say “I have such a bad migraine today” she’ll say something like “I do too I’ve been up all night and already taken x, y, and z” (medications or coping mechanisms). Or if I’m not feeling well enough to do a task she’ll say things like “well I’m sick too but I’m still doing xyz” which makes me feel like she has no sympathy even though she’s going through something similar. 

I’m lucky she doesn’t do it all the time, but the fact that she does it at all feels incredibly dismissing/belittling.

WTF,fctla3b,t1_fctk0w6,1577947467.0,"Ancient Egyptian’s shaved their heads and wore wigs of  braided or locked human hair (considering their geographic location and trade routes, they would have had access to both very curly, textured hair and straight human hair to make wigs of different styles). The Egyptians actually plucked or shaved almost all of their body hair. The Ancient Minoans actually did wear their hair in locs, most likely because they had very very curly hair that could form locs, and this was a protective style rather than matting. 

The Celts didn’t wear their hair in locs. Both the Vikings and the Celts kept their hair untangled but frequently woven into ornate braided plaits. We have archeological evidence of this as combs were so important to them, they are frequently found in burial sites (for both these groups of people). There was a brief period of time in Ireland where some men wore their bangs long and matted, but mats and locs are not the same. The archeological evidence we have regarding locs in Ancient Greece is a period of about 130 years when statues were depicting men’s hair being worn in locs before that style was abandoned in favor of other fashions and was never taken up again, like the obscure Irish fashion I listed above. The same thing goes for the Polish plait (one giant mat). 

There are the Hindu Sadhus who mat their hair into dreadlocks as a sign that they’ve renounced a worldly life in order to stay on a spiritual path. However, there are different Sadhus devoted to different deities. Sure, there are Sadhus devoted to Shiva, but there are also Sadhus devoted to Vishnu, and Shakti. And once again, the hairstyle of “dreadlocks” is a sign of religious devotion in a similar way to Rastafarians. (However, for black folks and other people of color with African roots, this hairstyle has a cultural significance as well as a function and should be respected as something that isn’t everyone’s for the taking just because they may like it. Especially when the style is not meant for hair that’s not very textured and curly). 

 A brief cultural variation in history is not significant enough grounds for white folks to try to claim shared entitlement to something that has cultural significance to a marginalized group of people today. Especially when they literally face discrimination for wearing their hair in a protective style for their hair type (frequently in the guise of dress codes which can affect them during their pursuit of an education and/or employment).  

But yeah, keep trolling and thinking that white folks in the states experience racism akin to what black folks experience. Keep trying desperately to find a way to be a victim, or troll, or whatever you’re trying to accomplish here. I can’t imagine suggesting that some things are not for everyone is enough to suggest it’s racist, that level of entitlement is beyond me."
WTF,fctikjc,t1_fctd9bd,1577944499.0,"Ah, so are you going to disregard my comment for a premeditated reply that you had ready in order to troll? That’s cool."
WTF,fctaex0,t1_fc5ben9,1577937231.0,"Personally  (I’m not OP, but) I think that it’s best for white folks not to have “dreads”. 

Locs have a lot of cultural significance for black folks. Making and maintaining locs as well and doing braids are important within black communities. Both as a source of income for folks, and because it brings people together and strengthens communities/neighborhoods.  Also, people of color and black folks are still actively being discriminated against for wearing their hair in this protective style. School dress codes as well as work dress codes often do not allow “dreadlocks”. Black folks are the majority of people wearing their hair in locs so this coded language is an example of institutionalized racism. My brother in law who is Afro-Colombian experienced this growing up, when in elementary school he was told go home and change his: “Ni***r hair” 

So in short, I personally feel that white people shouldn’t wear “dreadlocks” because it’s something with cultural and historical importance for the black community and European hair isnt supposed to be matted like that anyway. (Because black hair can form locs as a protective hairstyle which can be cleaned and maintained, but white hair has to be damaged to try to force it into a style not meant for white hair textures. mats can hold onto way more pollutants, dead skin cells, and dirt than compared to locs because of the different hair texture and structure of the end result). 

(Also, before anyone says “but other people in history wore dreadlocks who weren’t black” most of them didn’t, and the ones who did only did it for short periods of time in history. Historical “reasons” is not enough to justify something that has contemporary importance especially for a marginalized group of people. If you’d like a more detailed comment highlighting matted hairstyles in history, just let me know). 

In general, I think some things from other cultures should be respected and left in the culture/community where it’s from. Not everything is up for the taking for white folks to use or have ourselves. There are ways to show appreciation for other cultures, like supporting indigenous artisans and crafts people by purchasing their wares when they’re made to sell."

WTF,fct8xev,t1_fc5n18x,1577936034.0,"It’s usually white folks with matted hair who have  attempted to style their hair into “dreadlocks” like black folks. Their hair is much more likely to smell funky. Because of the texture of black hair, they can clean and maintain their locs and locs are considered to be a protective hairstyle for their hair type. Unlike matted hair which can hold onto, dead skin cells, dirt, dust, natural oils, second hand smoke, and moisture that can lead to mold. 

I’ve never ever encountered black folks with locs who smelled gross. I have encountered lame white kids with matted hair “dreadlocks” who smelled grody and generally had questionable personal hygiene."
WTF,fct8a8c,t1_fc6nkfa,1577935517.0,"No, they’re really not. “All hair can dread without intervention” You’re comparing an intentional hairstyle to neglected hair. There is also a huge difference depending on the texture of hair you start with. 

Locs can be formed easily with African hair and it’s considered to be a protective style for that hair type. Whereas, you have to damage European hair in order to force it into mats to attempt the same appearance. Locs do not damage black hair unless they ARE neglected, but intentionally locing hair does not itself damage black hair. 

People with African hair can coax their hair into locs without it forming mats. Their locs are almost hollow which is why they can be cleaned and maintained in a way that European hair that’s matted cannot. If you were to take a mat and cut in half and then do the same with a loc, the mat would be much denser by comparison and the general structure of the end result would be very different."

I strive to be very polite to people I interact with because so few people are and/or do little things like say please and thank you. One of my biggest pet peeves is the way some people talk to folks working at counters, drive throughs, or over the phone. 

I had a large to go order I placed on Christmas and the girl on the phone who was taking my order had a hard time hearing me at first. I told her to take her time and let me know when she was ready, warned her I had a large order and to stop me if she needed a moment while jotting it all down. I went slowly starting with “May I please have...” and thanked her earnestly for reading back my order to me to make sure it was correct. Afterwards she said: “oh my god you’re so nice, thank yo so much!” and I instantly imagined how many rude people must have been barking orders at her for lo mein all day. 

Being a little bit nice and polite can make a big difference and it takes so little effort. I honestly don’t understand why it’s not everyone’s default. People are such assholes.

So I have chronic pain, migraines with nausea and vomiting, and insomnia. Cannabis helps me with all of these things.

However, a few summers ago I got into smoking concentrates- specifically shatter, a type of dab. I developed **cannabiniod hyperemesis syndrome** It’s typically presented by

**Bouts of severe and frequent nausea and vomiting and/or cramping which is only soothed by bathing in hot water**

It’s truly dreadful. It feels like torture. When I experienced this I was vomiting every 5-15 minutes for HOURS at a time and becoming severely dehydrated. Before I knew that I was experiencing CHS I thought I had food poisoning, a virus, or a 24 hour stomach flu . The attacks happened to me 3 times if I remember correctly. I had only been using shatter for a month or so before the first attack and only used shatter for about 4/5 months. With one particularly bad bad episode I had been vomiting and dry heaving like clockwork almost every 10 minutes. I kept telling myself it was going to end but after 6 hours, multiple baths, I had no strength, no fluids in my system, and there was no end in sight. Just before 5am I called an ambulance to the hospital for my vomiting and dehydration. I subsequently found out about CHS and it matched my symptoms. 

**I stopped smoking concentrates and haven’t had a problem with CHS since**

(Edit: I want to add that I had felt really guilty about being unable to drive myself and calling an ambulance— like I had been wasting their time. But a friend of mine who is an EMT and works in an ambulance stopped me as I was saying this and told me: “severe dehydration is very serious and you did the right thing. Some people abuse ambulance services but if you are genuinely ill and unable to find a way to the hospital, do not beat yourself up for needing help” )"

WTF,fc5o5rw,t1_fc4x0oy,1577462468.0,"Ok but here’s the thing 

Locs are a protective style for black people’s hair. Because of the texture of black folk’s hair, it can be easily coaxed into locs and the locs can be cleaned and maintain.  However, if someone doesn’t have that hair type, they end up damaging their hair because they’re forcing it into a style that wasn’t created for their hair type.  They have matts instead of locs.

So there are a lot of white folks with ‘dreadlocks’ who’s hair is damaged and matted together in a desperate attempt to recreate locs. But the matts cannot be cleaned or maintained the same way black folks with locs can. Matts can hold onto dead skin cells, dirt & pollution, and can hold onto moisture which can lead to mold. 

So there are folks with moldy matts that smell funky like wet dog / other unpleasant odors. There are also people of color with locs that haven’t been cared for and can get grody."
