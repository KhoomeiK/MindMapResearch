raisedbynarcissists,fgngi67,t3_ezfp7f,1580944382.0,You are wise beyond your years. You will succeed.
JUSTNOMIL,fgn2vya,t1_fgmtqsb,1580936654.0,Really? Why? I am not objecting. I just might try it.
legaladvice,fgn0ft6,t1_fgmyqq3,1580935337.0,Good point.  I was only thinking of preventing adverse possession of the land.
AskHR,fgmtvz3,t1_fgmt82n,1580931957.0,Exactly. They want it both ways. New hire = no accrued leave or benefits. It should also mean they don’t recoup anything from your last job.
tifu,fgmo9wf,t3_ez6zhw,1580928660.0,I didn’t know Netflix and Chill was a euphemism until now. Good thing I am too broke to go to my hairdresser and never embarrassed myself like this.
Adoption,fgmngll,t3_ezbupl,1580928178.0,I contacted distant cousins through 23&Me and found my bio mom and things are going great. Found bio dad through Ancestry. All good on that end as well.
AskHR,fgmjae5,t3_ez9458,1580925707.0,"This sounds weird. You had to reapply for a new job. It sounds like they want it both ways - you are a new hire, except for when they can take money from you. Did vacation time and other benefits accrue for the time they are deducting waves for you? No? They want it both ways. Not cool. Don’t know if it is legal."
legaladvice,fgmj097,t3_ezarrs,1580925543.0,"If all else fails, you can give him written permission to use the part of your land he is using. This will prevent him from taking it through adverse possession."

AmItheAsshole,fgmgmib,t1_fgldujx,1580924144.0,"Umm.  Ken has taken your husband’s side. He values his job more than your family. I can’t understand the mental gymnastics you are doing here, as an outsider looking in. (Having been in similar shoes though, I can tell you I justified and explained and defended my Nex’s otherwise inexplicable actions.) It is okay that your husband is keeping you a secret at the office because the Ken-fairy is there to protect you?  And your husband doesn’t want drama or backlash at the office but is willing to do 1000x worse to his wife and kid? Ken is a future Flying Monkey. See you soon on NarcsandDivorce or whatever the sub is called. I know I sound harsh. I really say this with all the sympathy and support I have in me. I have been this level of lied to and defended him for a decade. Talk to a family lawyer about the differences between leaving before the baby is born and after."
AmItheAsshole,fgmfke6,t3_ez6g6u,1580923520.0,"Talk to a family lawyer ASAP. There is a big custody battle coming your way, if your future ex-husband wants it. He may want custody just to avoid paying child support. You may have to high-tail it outta there before the kiddo is born. His lying will not stop. He is lying to you. He is lying to his GF. He is lying to his coworkers. Lies of omission are real and insidious.  It isn’t that this won’t end well, it is that it is already OVER and you don’t even realize it. Family attorney. Right now. Go! Edit so it counts: NTA, but you are totally missing the point."
JUSTNOMIL,fgiq5b7,t3_eyprav,1580828377.0,"Your MIL is welcome to go to Chernobyl. She can go with her travel agent friend.

Good luck keeping your distance from her."
JUSTNOMIL,fgipqnx,t1_fgiixq6,1580828100.0,That was heartbreaking.
Adoption,fgil1qz,t3_eyo268,1580824708.0,"I did Ancestry and found bio dad’s family, then I did 23andMe and found bio mom’s family. Everything is going really well on both sides of the family. Good luck!"

FamilyLaw,fgiicke,t3_eynds5,1580822528.0,"Uh oh. IANAL, but you are going to have to dig deep. Mine stole boatloads of money from me from the business I bought him. He also forged checks from my accounts, siphoned thousands out of our joint account. You name it, he did it. Pull your credit report and see if he opened accounts in your name. Freeze your credit. Prepare for the sh*t to hit the fan because you could be about to expose some big lies and deception. Get a free initial consultation with a lawyer. Good luck!"

facepalm,fgfrzpd,t1_fgfma2v,1580746291.0,"You can “nominate” a friend or relative to take the child/children at first. This keeps them out of the “system” inasmuch as you know the person caring for your kids. They generally don’t get paid but may get a little funding for groceries or clothes, but not much. Source: was considered a “family” placement for my friend’s kids. So, to me it is conceivable that the mom asked the social worker to call someone she thought cared about her child to take care of it in this situation. But, it could just be a BS post."

It has been incredibly hard to keep my mind together to do everything I have to do. I will tell you though that I am so glad I am not with him and even with my health issues, it is so much better to be free of him. If I was with him, I would still have these health issues but would have to take care of his bogus issues instead of myself. I haven’t regretted it for a minute. You will get through this and be happier for it. PM me anytime. Sending hugs and high fives."
AmItheAsshole,fg39zjf,t1_fg0kzd6,1580475720.0,"Agreed. I don’t see the connection between the parties and standing next to the bride in a bridesmaid dress. YTA, OP."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,fg39l7q,t1_fg2eogt,1580475358.0,"Legal document or no, he could still keep them in another country and you will spend a fortune and several years to get them back. A 30 hour flight for little kids sounds awful. How well do the people taking them know they kids? 

Do not talk to him. Have him say everything he has to say in email. You should not respond to any email right away. Take your time to think about how your response would be received by a judge. I think a thirty hours flight is a good enough reason to say no for little kids, but that is just me and I don’t know how the courts would see that."
ParentingWithaNarc,fg37pst,t1_fg24hvd,1580473563.0,I would validate her feelings and be careful of trying to make her see things to rosily. She shouldn’t think things are ok or any other than what they are. I just I am just putting my own demons in it because I was gaslighted for so long.
AmItheAsshole,fg1tdb0,t1_fg1qsnr,1580432913.0,"Yes, where is the father’s family? And why hasn’t that thought even crossed my mind?"
ParentingWithaNarc,fg1olfm,t3_ewcxuq,1580430886.0,"Self-centeredness and throwing little tantrums is normal for a kid.  I worry about my son inheriting Narc traits too. I see a lot of his father in him and it scares and worries me. He also hates his dad and the kids describe him as “real daddy” and “fake daddy”. Real daddy ignores them and plops them in front of the TV. Fake daddy becomes the world’s best dad when other people are watching. She will see through her dad soon. 

I just try to give my kids a normal family life when they are with me. And that includes making mistakes. All moms make mistakes. Be kind to yourself. Don’t beat yourself up and don’t blame yourself."
AmItheAsshole,fg0oavg,t1_ffzwgoe,1580411819.0,"Apparently your SIL agree on some things - men screw up in ways women don’t. However, I never stop being surprised. I should learn to expect it the way she does."

insaneparents,ffyapzn,t1_ffy79bc,1580341963.0,Yes. Better to get a rash that looks like the measles than the actual measles!
AskAnAmerican,ffwx6hi,t3_evfitr,1580313036.0,I think DC should be the 51st state. Residents pay federal taxes and do not receive a federal payment the way some people think. They do not have voting representation in the House or Senate. We export democracy but don’t have it for the residents of our nation’s capitol.
raisedbynarcissists,ffwwjiu,t3_evd32l,1580312631.0,Why was he even going through bags in your garage? It makes no sense.
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,ffwr3bt,t3_evliku,1580308967.0,Bringing the kids to his parents’ house is his mistake to make. It could backfire on you in court if you prevent it. Let him make his mistakes. It is not your place to save him from himself. Follow the court order. Judges don’t give a bleep about what makes sense or is good for the kids. They care about court orders and parenting time.
entitledparents,ffuh0hs,t1_ffue1bg,1580241767.0,"They might have to pay mileage, no matter how far you go. I worked for a small business that paid mileage the second you left the parking lot. It is a federal law, I believe. Otherwise, they may want to rent a car for you."

Talk to a lawyer to see how you can get him out of the house. Mine stayed in the house, wouldn’t tell me when he was leaving, and the kids and I slept on an air mattress at my mom’s. He racked up all sorts of bills in my name. Ordered every porn movie under the sun, I had to pay for it. Didn’t pay for the mortgage, electric, etc.  Thankfully, he didn’t destroy my things. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn’t trust him to not place hidden cameras in the house to record you when you come back. And my ex tried to steal the dog when he left.  Good luck."

NarcAbuseAndDivorce,ffak9of,t3_ese6e3,1579737830.0,"My Nex was diagnosed. Even the person who did the test said not to subpoena her test and records. Don’t even tell him that he is a Narc because he can use it to his advantage and become better at it. At least your kids are getting older already. Document his behaviors, like everyone else said. The judges will just say that Dad has a right to see his kid. He can be an awful dad, that is okay in the eyes of the court. Your eldest won’t want to go see him in a few years. Be prepared to spend the next 11 years in and out of court. And whoever said not to go to therapy with a Narc is right. And when you mediate, if it is ever required, insist on separate rooms. Good luck!"
