PrequelMemes,ff01x5x,t1_ff01c3c,1579464345.0,"Not sure what being black has to do with anything, but it’s called plot armor.

Finn is still a main character and in SW there are bacta tanks that can heal pretty much anything, he is also force sensitive but I don’t think that matters.

Having your spine slashed isn’t instant death so it can be healed in SW.

I don’t see how you can have beef about the lightsabers in the sequels if they didn’t bother you in the other movies, similar situations happened throughout the entire saga.

Bash the trash tier story but I am totally fine with the Lightsabers, which is what this post was about."

PS5,fekp4ou,t1_fekofjp,1579204694.0,"3rd party sales is only a 30% cut though, right? That's the same cut Steam makes and last I checked that was the standard cut among all of the console storefronts, so exclusives are a much higher margin before you subtract how much Sony spent developing it.

They would retain the same cut if they could sell games on a Sony store for PC but they would have more competition with Steam and such.

There's no proof that its better than a 2080 just rumors, Nvidia thinks the 2070 will be better, but time will tell whats really under the hood. 

You cant build an equally powerful PC for $500 though thats for sure so it just depends on the budget."
PS5,feknxs6,t1_fekln41,1579203989.0,"Console margins are razor thin, they make their profit on game sales, M$ knows this and all the exclusives are on PC as well now.

Sony could do the same thing and if they really wanted to keep all the profit they could make a ""Sony Launcher/Game store"" (They lose no money by doing this, and could gain additional customers)

Also you can literally build a PC right now that is more powerful than the PS5 if you're willing to spend the money, so I dont know how they're going to convert PC players. A mouse is awfully nice for shooters as well.

I normally buy all the consoles in addition to keeping my PC up to date so I dont miss out on anything but that could change if consoles lose their exclusives.

Im not sure Sony will do this but it would be nice, then we just need to get Nintendo on board."

PS4,fehmopd,t1_fehmjd0,1579119656.0,"It’s frame pacing, some games do it well for example HZD, an example of it being bad is FFXV

PS4,fehlcdz,t1_fehgg6k,1579118877.0,I suppose it depends on your definition of great. Witcher 3 was low-med settings and would regularly dip below 30 fps. I think I've gotten spoiled with my PC.
PS5,fehklaz,t1_fehi5kl,1579118445.0,It was a bold claim by them but they are the largest GPU maker. If we are measuring by Tflops and going by rumors then it is in the 2070 Super territory.
PS4,fehhitu,t1_fehfxlg,1579116653.0,"Doesnt the Pro literally have the same CPU? The upgrade is in the GPU and this ancient Jaguar CPU is a huge bottleneck, its why Witcher 3 ran so poorly even with below low settings for population density."
PS5,fehh416,t3_ep6r1s,1579116411.0,"According to NVIDIA, the RTX 2070 is more powerful than what the PS5 has. So that means its in between a 2060 and a 2070 power wise if we are to believe them.

Which is quite a bit better than a 1660 already. In addition to that, there is extra optimization for consoles so you need some extra horsepower on top of that for PC. If you need to upgrade now I would get something like a 2080 Super, or just wait for the RTX 3000 series later this year.

However if you're only chasing 1080p gaming and dont mind having no ray tracing then you could probably get by with a weaker card. 

If you're on a budget like that I would probably just wait for PS5, I only game on PC primarily because I can afford a maxed out rig where the difference is massive in performance and visuals. With PC you're paying more for less until you reach a certain threshold of $1500+ on a rig."

PS5,febu9o9,t3_eo8j3k,1578962743.0,"First of all you can use mouse and keyboard with any console game via XIM4 but people consider it ""cheating""

The trade-off has always been that controllers feel better for movement and shooting via triggers and is immersive via rumble/haptics but it lacks in the aiming department. I mostly game on PC due to vastly preferring the accuracy of a mouse and not wanting to bother with a XIM.

However aim assist is actually a big deal, the new COD Modern Warfare has shared lobbies with console and PC users and I have seen controller users at the top of leaderboards no problem, the accuracy they lose is made up for with strong aim assist if they know how to abuse/take advantage of it properly.

I dont see PS5 ""fixing"" this problem, what can you even do besides gyro? which I doubt would be that good. Maybe once VR becomes more mainstream we will actually be aiming fake guns instead.

The reason why thumbsticks arent accurate is the short range of motion, PS4 sticks are actually worse than xbox because they are a little bit shorter. This is where those expensive ""Scuf controllers"" come in, with options for longer sticks, or the cheaper option is just attaching ""Kontrol Freeks"" but they fall off easily. The extra range of motion from a taller stick can make a dramatic difference, I used them back in the day when I played shooters on console."
