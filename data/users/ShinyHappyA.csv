LDR,fdmcj90,t3_em0igy,1578545575.0,You’re not the only one. I’m currently trying to get out of this rut. I don’t think I dealt with him leaving properly (keeping busy or hanging with friends and stuff) and my depression kicked in and got really bad. Just remember to take care of yourself. It’s always really hard but if you can try to look forward to your next meet. This community is so helpful because no matter how you’re feeling you can always come here and know you’re not the only one and even talk to people who know exactly what you’re going through.

travisscott,fcj34cy,t1_fcj2glk,1577676082.0,What's this? You continue to be completely fucking useless? How surprising! You get off on calling women sassy and being rude? I've looked through different posts about this and I didn't find what I was looking for that's why I made my own post. Which you didn't really answer just used it as a way to be an asshole and entertain yourself.
travisscott,fcj26ke,t1_fcg17wo,1577675420.0,Dude if you're not gonna help go eat an ass. Or a dick if that's your thing. Don't really care but you can't be a dick and tell me to cut the sass. Fuck off
travisscott,fcd8re0,t1_fcbsl9a,1577607759.0,Last I checked I can still read. I meant that I wasn't sure if they'd actually ship the product. I've ordered from other sites similar to this one and never received my product. I found out afterwards that the site wasn't legit. Thanks for pointing that out! What would I do without people like you!
bulletjournal,fbxd0ro,t3_eeqvn8,1577180857.0,For some reason I didn’t even think about getting gold acrylic paint. Thank you so much!
bulletjournal,fbx0wwm,t3_eeqvn8,1577165191.0,Hey what did you use for the gold?
bulletjournal,fbldyiy,t3_eci20o,1576961617.0,What markers or products do you use that show up on a black page? I recently bought a black page journal as well and I’m scared nothing will show up on it
