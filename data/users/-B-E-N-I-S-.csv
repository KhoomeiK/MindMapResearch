Fun fact: if you’ve ever been driving on a slippery surface, hit your brakes and had a close call to a collision you’ve probably got your cars Automatic Braking System (ABS) to thank which was originally developed for the brakes on the wheels of warplanes in the 20’s and for race cars in the 50’s.

modernwarfare,fcs46uz,t1_fcr6w17,1577911219.0,"I’m not so sure about that. Most of these people aren’t actually creating the cheating software after all, they’re just downloading it. I’ve known a few guys who are into all this modding/cheating bullshit but they didn’t actually create the cheats, they just loved utilizing them. Also, when I was younger I used to go to school with this kid who would play Halo firefight (against a bunch of bots) but he would adjust the settings in the lobby so that he had super speed, high jump, extremely overpowered weapons and essentially invisible levels of health. He actually used to love this shit. I’m gonna act as an armchair psychologist for a minute here. I don’t think these people use cheats because they want any sort of challenge or have something to prove or some trophy to gain: the reasoning behind it is more often than not, much more pathetic. These people just get enjoyment out of having supreme levels of control and the ability to overpower others. Just being able to easily defeat all those other players is so enjoyable to these people despite the fact that they never earned it. Cheaters like this don’t have much honour or integrity but they have massive levels of pride and they’re typically sore losers who will do whatever it takes to win.

TLDR: I don’t think these people are doing this for a challenge. They do it because they’re mildly psychotic, sore losing, pathetic manchdren."
