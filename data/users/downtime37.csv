It may take therapy to get the memory of over cooked, mushy pasta and huge pieces of tomato (one of the few vegetables I could not stand at the time) out of my mind.  Sorry to be a downer on your post (you're does not look anything like theirs so well done) but just the word instantly brings to mind the thought that I'll need to get all my homework done before dinner because I'm going to be at the table for a couple of hours minim (we were not allowed up unless our plate was clean)."

NFL_Draft,ffr9ep7,t1_ffr8pfb,1580153317.0,"It's possible to find a talent in the 3rd that can be developed into an impact player but the chances of finding a day one impact player is pretty slim.  I do agree that the 3rd and the '21 1st could be flipped back into a late 1st round or early 2nd but I still think they'll get more for this spot, we'll find out in April if I'm right."
NFL_Draft,ffr8rnc,t1_ffr6lc5,1580152923.0,"Fair enough that's more accurate than 'constantly' which imply's it has always been a problem.  As for the remainder of your post breaking down the Lions I don't agree with most of it but I'm sure you're tired of my by now so I'll leave it alone, have a great day."
NFL_Draft,ffr7p6u,t1_ffr3qqj,1580152257.0,"Why did you restart the numbering after every trade?  


Oh and I'm good with the Lions getting 1.5 and 1/18 but I think it'll be probably be 1.26 and I'm OK with it if it is."
NFL_Draft,ffr773h,t1_ffr5es2,1580151944.0,"Well I think those questions disapper after the combine, I thought I made it clear in my post but maybe not, I'm not trying to get a 1.5/2nd, '21 1st and more, I want to drop the '21 pick all together (unless they can flip it with someone for a '20 2nd or late 1st) and get max picks for this year draft.  Lots of team that will be looking to move up and have extra picks this year, I think I'll be right come draft day, We'll end up with multiple '20 draft picks."
NFL_Draft,ffr6p2n,t1_ffr69jb,1580151628.0,Agree I worry that the Giants grab Simmons @5 but if that happens we still have a chance at Okudah which still gives us a shut down corner.
NFL_Draft,ffr6f1i,t1_ffr43iz,1580151458.0,"He had back problem this year and the previous year, show me anything from years prior where he had back injuries? As for his other bumps and scraps he gets no more or less than any other QB and he plays threw them all.  I get he's getting older and wear and tear are going to start taking a larger toll on his body and if you think he's durability ******in the future****** may be an issue than OK, say that.  But for the past 7 years prior to him sitting this year Stafford has been incredibly durable so give him that credit."
NFL_Draft,ffr58vl,t1_ffr377b,1580150735.0,"Assuming the Lions are not able to trade back for extra picks than I'm good with Simmons/Okudah/Brown at #3, in that order."

NFL_Draft,ffr4eu7,t1_ffr103j,1580150220.0,You're probably right but it's an interesting what if and breaks up the constant mocks where we take Okudah.

NFL_Draft,ffr3hc4,t1_ffr0r9r,1580149640.0,"No way they make this trade, BQ and MP need picks this year that can start right away.  A 3rd is not going to equal a day one starter and a first in '21 does them no good if they aren't here."
NFL_Draft,ffr2xoe,t1_ffr1xt3,1580149301.0,"I saw that after I posted and found the Lions GM post, sorry I should have come back and edited it.  Thanks for getting back to me about it and for all the work you and everyone else put in on this, well done."
NFL_Draft,ffqsglc,t3_eudnje,1580142598.0,"You show the Lions trading 1.3 to Mia for 1.5/2.56 & '21 1st, but than  6 lines down you have the Lions trading 2.35/ '20 DET 4th with GB for 1.3, what am I missing?  

As for the draft itself, 1.5 Okudah, 1.30 Murray (not sure where this cam from, no note about a trade), 2.56 Muti. 

Like the help on D, a shut down corner and a LB who can both cover and tackle, yes please.  Mati in the 2nd fills a need on the OL but has had multiple injuries over the last couple of seasons so durability could be a concern.


Edit, I should have added that I think the Lions get more than a trade down, 2nd and a '21 1st.  Unless they can flip that '21 pick back to this year's draft it is meaningless to BQ and MP who have to win now and to do that need players this year not next year.  Also once Washington takes Chase the Lions can get a feeding frenzy going between MIA/CAR/LAC that will result in them getting multiple 2020 picks for the 1.3 spot."

As for the Lions pick I'd rather see Brown at 10 over Epenesa, our DT position was terrible this year and needs a force in the middle, Brown can be that.  I'd also rather have ILB or CB in the 2nd, bigger need than S (unless that player is named Simmons).  Over all one of the fresher mocks I've seen OP, well done."
NFL_Draft,ff3qgth,t1_ff3f1y3,1579546648.0,Simmons to the Lions is a pick I can be happy with in this mock.
NFL_Draft,ff3qcfp,t1_ff3ahz3,1579546573.0,"I like the Simmons pick (would like it better if we traded back to 7 or 8 to take him, but no trades in this mock so that's beside the point).  Simmons along with Okudah and Brown are my 3 top wish list picks in the first round.  Grabbing Lewis in the 2nd defiantly gives us a day one starter at the DE spot across from Flowers.  Another option to consider, (shout out to YouTuber 'Der Goes Mobby' for the great breakdown, ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55tFkV3tIY&feature=youtu.be, and to /u/TankforchaseDL who posted it on /r/detroitlions ), is DT.  Per Mobby's breakdown of the numbers in his video our DE's where not the DL's main problem, it was the DT's that where completely ineffective and should be the priority for upgrading, just something to think about for future mocks."
