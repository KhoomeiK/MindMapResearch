AskReddit,ffcn2hj,t1_ffc476m,1579802946.0,"See, I have a very specific fear. Like. Okay. I'm terrified a moth is going to get in my mouth. I have no idea why the idea is so terrifying to me and everyone who I tell thinks it's hilarious. Which valid, it is hilarious. But like. Once people know I'm tormented with long descriptions of what I can only safely describe as 'butterfly kisses' and even that makes me shudder. I just. Telling me they won't intentionally land in my mouth isn't HELPFUL. They bebop into all kinds of dumb places. They're stupid. Or wicked. Or both. :("

SuicideWatch,ff9f8ig,t3_es6puu,1579711743.0,"I feel like deciding I can't leave my dogs behind is a petty reason to keep going. I keep telling myself they're 'just dogs'. But then I wake up in a freezing room, and my shivering isn't just my own. One of my pups refused to leave no matter how cold it got. She was cold to the touch, and it scared me at first. Then she blinked and rolled towards me and I decided that a petty reason is good enough for me. I found a warm place for us to curl up and held her until we went back to sleep. I'm not okay, but I'm alive. So. Eh. Yeah."
SuicideWatch,ff6gndf,t3_ertq73,1579626785.0,"I like to think of it in physical terms. It's like being on a downward slope. The deeper you fall, the faster your decline gets. The 'it gets better' concept is akin to holding on tight and hoping that eventually, you'll reach a ramp that will launch you into happiness. It happens, but it's more of an exception to the rule. 

People also entertain the idea of 'rock bottom' when it doesn't exist. Things can get endlessly worse. There is no end. So the idea of hitting the bottom and climbing up from there isn't particularly useful either. So you have a few options, and they're not easy. Sometimes they seem downright impossible. 

Continuing the metaphor, you have to slow and eventually stop the freefall before climbing back up. It can be like clinging to the asphalt and slowly losing speed. It can be painful. It can be like losing pieces of yourself to road burn. But eventually you could slow and stop. 

It could be exhausting. It won't always be pleasant. It won't be as easy as holding on and hoping. And it's not nice to hear. It's not as transparently encouraging, but like people have said, simple platitudes can be worse.

So it isn't a guarantee that it will just GET BETTER. It can, though. Especially if one puts in the occasionally agonizing effort.

Of course, it's easier with a few helping hands. Aren't most things, though? I'm willing to shed a few layers of skin to help slow some free falls. I'm not the only one. And my inbox is always open.

Don't give up. It won't be simple and it won't be guaranteed, but things CAN get better. It's worth trying for imo."
SuicideWatch,ff51twm,t3_erjz48,1579577939.0,"Through the years, I've had a tendency to self-isolate only to later regret it and plead for another chance. There was one person who always gave me that extra chance. Until, awhile back, they didn't anymore. I didn't get to say goodbye. I didn't get to say anything I wanted to say because I pushed so hard that they finally believed I wanted them gone. I didn't. I still don't. There are only a couple of people in my life that I pushed away, and it hurt this much. They happened to be simultaneous and I'm not sure what to do. If there is anything to do. I suppose they'll give me another chance eventually. The problem is I don't know if I deserve it. 

Something I've been told repeatedly is that I can't choose for people. If they care, I can't decide they suddenly don't. What I can do, and have done, is make it all the more difficult-- often impossible."
SuicideWatch,ff507x4,t3_er9kki,1579576746.0,"I have a tendency to argue for subjectivity. What one person might consider devotion, another might find not worth mentioning. What exactly defines love? And why do you want that specific thing? Do you want to matter? There are a number of people who would argue you do. Sure, everything can be dismissed as a chemical reaction, but does that make it less real? In which case, what is real?"
SuicideWatch,ff4zm23,t3_ero1pg,1579576298.0,"Me too. There are things preventing me from doing as much, however. Venting can often help so I won't press the issue. There are people who want to help, though."
SuicideWatch,ff4zejr,t3_ericxm,1579576146.0,"I'm halfway through your post and fully intend to finish but I've noticed some persistent logical fallacies that I've practiced myself so, I want to ask: are humans inherently worthless, or do we lack a basic capacity to fulfill some worth? You keep mentioning that no one can make a difference, but the opposite could be argued. The butterfly effect and other such theories-- it's all conceptual. But you seem torn between thinking there is no meaning, and that there is no meaning the average person can achieve. Completely different. I'd appreciate more insight and don't want to seem dismissive."
SuicideWatch,ff4yi7w,t1_ff4xx7e,1579575510.0,And this isn't an attempt to think I can solve your problems. Solutions are subjective. So much is subjective in the sense that no one shares the exact POV. I just... I always thought it would get better just because one can only sink so low. There is no bottom. There is no top. It's not so finite. But things don't just GET BETTER.
SuicideWatch,ff4xx7e,t3_erhro1,1579575106.0,"What they fail to add is that it doesn't get better if you sit and wait for it to. In a sense, the 'it gets better' movement has been more harmful than anything. People entertain the concept of a rock bottom at the end of their downward spiral. There is no bottom. Things can and will get worse if you make no effort to break the trajectory. Things get better if you stop intentionally making them worse. For people like me? That's stupid hard. But it's not hopeless. Things could get better. But not when I'm pushing myself downhill faster and faster. It's not even intentional sometimes. It's a compulsion that I don't deserve better. Things would get better if I made the slightest effort. But I don't know how. I don't know where to start."
Cameras,fe4hpb5,t1_fe12r2d,1578859448.0,"Thanks a lot for the answer! I appreciate it. And I'll check out camera quest as a starting point here on out, I just didn't really know where to start. :)"
Cameras,fdztbrq,t1_fdzt9fo,1578795316.0,"Yep, seeing as I made the post in the first place. Don't you have a million other people to antagonize judging from your post history? You must be very busy, I hate to monopolize that."
Cameras,fdzt52i,t1_fdzt0r8,1578795190.0,"Wow, I have been thoroughly roasted. Sick man. I'm never coming to reddit again. Seriously, it's a simple question, do you seriously have this much time on your hands just to be a douchebag?"
Cameras,fdzsqnn,t1_fdzsnw8,1578794914.0,Beyond wikipedia articles. I would like to know more than when it was made.

BPD,fdfxa39,t1_fdfwy5c,1578372742.0,"I'm available to chat if you ever want insight from someone with BPD, and recognizes how terrible it can be for both me and my loved ones. I'm sure you're already well aware, but the only one who can get him help is... him, ultimately. <3 It's rough and you're hella strong for persevering."
BPD,fdfv17m,t1_fdfujfa,1578370955.0,"You deserve to be happy. I understand how agonizing heartbreak can be. I dated my ex(???) for just a year and it still hurts every day. Honestly  it's a no contact situation, take care of you! I sincerely hope you're not waiting for him. I'm probably the biggest hypocrite for saying this, but there are people out there who have the capacity to make you just as happy if not happier.  <3"
BPD,fdftp9o,t1_fd9j518,1578369959.0,"My dogs. As sad as this reply may seem, if no one loves me, my pups do. And God, for whatever is real and isn't, bless you for loving and supporting your husband. It's so easy to feel alone. And with the understanding that he will lash out at times, and it being for you to decide to stay or not, please understand that your love is the most beautiful thing in the world. It may seem easy to blame yourself for his fits-- if he's anything akin to me. But it's not your fault. I promise. You're great."
SuicideWatch,fdft1gy,t3_el57nt,1578369484.0,"I still don't know what is or isn't real. I do know my dog nudged me to the bathroom and stayed beside me, refusing to move as I clumsily patted her while puking my guts up for a half hour. I won't call this a happy ending. I'm still not positive I'll wake up in the morning, for whatever that means in this world. But I might. And for all people say one has to live for themselves... that may be true. But if a lil critter too good for this world makes it easier, I'll let her."
SuicideWatch,fdfpqqg,t3_el57nt,1578367263.0,"I often wonder if dogs are real as well. They're so kind and have such capacity for love. I occasionally worry what might happen to them when I'm gone. For now, my pups are my final companions and I suppose that is how it's meant to be. There are so many people I'd like to say goodbye to. But I'm vaguely certain they never were, either. And if they exist I only hope they don't blame themselves."
AmItheAsshole,fbyh2yc,t1_fbygkj4,1577216723.0,"Haha! That's true! Honestly for people like me with a self-deprecating sense of humor, this could either be affective or comforting. And if any figure artists/calligraphy artist would be interested in this idea, to release to the general public (preferably as a free hi res download) please  contact me? I know a lot of people would think this idea is silly, but for me, a sense of humor helps a lot. I can't be the only one. And I want to help my fellow chunky chans for Christmas. Help people in general. Sorry for the long reply but I'm interested into looking into this. :)"
