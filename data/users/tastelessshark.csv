dataisbeautiful,fgr59r2,t1_fgpm6g0,1581038488.0,Seriously. I've *literally* never heard of him and I thought I was doing a semi-decent job of keeping up with Dem candidates.
DIY,fgocj0r,t1_fgo886f,1580965588.0,There's a ton of custom Catan stuff on Etsy.

Showerthoughts,fglcga3,t1_fgkufb8,1580890715.0,"I use them for pretty much everything but YouTube. I tend to only watch YouTube videos from people I actually like, so I'm fine with sitting through 30 seconds of ads for them."

nba,fg131ef,t1_fg05qgu,1580419809.0,"What's interesting is that that Married With Children comment is highly upvoted, but basically every comment agreeing with it in the replies is massively downvoted."
nba,fg12tj4,t1_fg0cnrl,1580419703.0,The secret is that most of the people complaining about this are actually just bigots upset about not being able to make their shitty jokes anymore. They don't understand the difference between lampshading stereotypes and actually expressing them as factual.
nba,fg12kkm,t1_fg0jt91,1580419581.0,Yep. You can say pretty much whatever you want as long as it's actually even vaguely clever. The people who say shit look this are just upset they can't casually express their bigotry through shitty jokes without facing repercussions.
pics,ffyof4n,t1_ffymrnl,1580351254.0,My guess is maybe because tobacco's still legal and readily available most smokers are willing to go through the trouble of spending a ton to buy cigs legally rather than having to deal with a dealer?

explainlikeimfive,ffv7m0i,t1_ffugdtg,1580257600.0,"I'd say practicing math problems can be pretty good for review once you actually understand the theory behind what you're doing. I could probably explain most of the theory (or at least the broad strokes) behind basic calculus pretty easily off the top of my head, but if you asked me to take a calculus test right now I'd probably have some issues because I haven't actually had to actually work many calculus problems in a while. If you gave me a few hours to work through some problems, I'd probably do a passable job."
Showerthoughts,ffv5ycb,t3_evaxss,1580256463.0,"I literally haven't gotten to use a calculator in a math class since like 9th grade, so not in my case."
PrequelMemes,ffv35yu,t1_ffv1k0x,1580254601.0,"Yep. I think a clean slate was a net positive, particularly because Disney has shown that they are willing to bring back stuff from the EU that actually works (Thrawn for example). I actually haven't read many of the new comics or books, but I've heard generally good things. There really was some weird shit in Legends. I can't remember what book it was, but I remember reading one that was largely about Luke and Lando flying around to find Lando a wife (I think there was other stuff happening with Han in the book, but that's the bit I remember)."
PrequelMemes,ffv2dhk,t1_ffuqq24,1580254088.0,"The main issue with legends is that it's so goddamn bloated, it's often contradictory, and it varies wildly in quality. At least there's a certain level of consistency (although quality definitely still varies) in the new stuff, and it actually all meshes well together because everything is heavily coordinated."
Stadia,ffs4s5i,t3_eusxgc,1580173125.0,"You know, I never really had high hopes for Stadia, but Google managed to set the bar way lower than even I expected. Kudos to them I guess."
Fantasy,ffry9n2,t1_ffrrc87,1580168645.0,Cradle only really starts to pick up in the second book (although the last third or so of the first book is way more interesting than the earlier bits too).

television,ffrkat8,t1_ffqg2ch,1580159772.0,"I imagine they probably have similar crap but I feel like Amazon (much as I dislike their business practices) has a much more consistent catalog of original stuff in terms of quality. Also they have the Expanse, so they kind of win automatically. (Speaking of which, I should really get caught up on that. I still haven't even finished season 2)."
television,ffrjw0d,t1_ffqfagz,1580159525.0,You've just made me consider that the only streaming services I technically pay for are Hulu and Showtime (and that's just because I have the spotify student plan so I get everything for like 5 bucks). I have access to basically every other major service through family members.
books,ffo26q3,t1_ffnu9mc,1580073411.0,Yeah. This feels like a much weirder comparison than the movie theater thing. Particularly because there's an upper limit on how many people can even attend professional sporting events.
nottheonion,ffnyzrc,t1_ffnehly,1580072449.0,The shitty theater in my home town has such ridiculous prices. They're often literally double the price of the much nicer theater that's like 20 minutes further away. It definitely only survives because of the convenience factor.
todayilearned,ffnt6vw,t1_ffnmn3j,1580070471.0,Yeah. Harvard (along with  pretty much all the other ivy leagues I assume) is one of those weird cases where getting in is by far the most difficult part of attending.

Showerthoughts,ffjrxh4,t1_ffjpgjr,1580005305.0,"There are definitely people who genuinely like it, but I get the impression that most people drink it more because it's cheap, available literally everywhere, and has a really mild taste."
Showerthoughts,ffjrhf7,t1_ffjr2bs,1580005005.0,"Yeah. I mean drink what you like, but I've never understood why you wouldn't just buy cheap vodka and a mixer if your only goal is to get a buzz."
Showerthoughts,ffjrbvz,t1_ffjkwxe,1580004904.0,"You ever had Blue Moon? It should be available pretty much anywhere and it's actually not a light lager (it's a witbier), unlike literally every other popular beer in the us."

Fantasy,fet6jz2,t1_fet2qoq,1579372220.0,"Nope. Talking about Warhammer 40k. The reason people are recommending other stuff is that OP was also asking for more general grimdark recommendations. 40k is pretty much the origin of the term grimdark, so that's probably why OP was asking about it specifically."
Fantasy,fet6evl,t1_fet2bi6,1579372199.0,"40k does refer to Warhammer 40k, but the OP also mentioned wanting grimdark recommendations in general, so people are recommending other stuff as well."

pcgaming,fel7brp,t1_fekbnjy,1579215616.0,I hope this means they're actually committing to the statement they made about not working their employees to death like what happened during Witcher 3 development. Edit: https://www.pcgamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-developers-will-be-required-to-crunch-following-its-delay/ evidently it means the opposite
worldnews,fej53qq,t1_fej3lc6,1579157251.0,Literally the only aspect of interpersonal communication he has a grasp of (and not exactly a strong one) is bullying and extortion.

I'm not really sure what I'm going to read next, because I have a few partially finished books to get back to and a bunch of stuff I haven't even started.

Fantasy,fds8ofd,t1_fdqxphx,1578696878.0,"I mean, the difference between Aragorn and actual monarchs is that his rule is actually divinely mandated though right? All the actual monarchs who claimed divine right were (whether or not they actually believed themselves to be divinely mandated) just using it an excuse to maintain power."
Games,fdov0ig,t1_fdonrzv,1578613497.0,"Yeah. I really don't understand the refusal to launch smaller titles at 40. I mean, it's Nintendo *and* Pokemon so it'll sell well regardless, but I wouldn't be surprised if they would ultimately make more selling it at 40."
MurderedByWords,fdom6zn,t1_fdol9m8,1578607977.0,Yeah. It's pretty safe to assume that most porn stars don't have blood on their hands. The same can't be said for most presidents.
