Capitalism strives to increase profits and for most businesses the highest cost of the business is labor. Therefore, it's in capitalisms best interest to have the employees making as little as possible. In other words, capitalism is poverty for those without the means of production. Even if you make a good wage, you are still being exploited, as you wouldn't have a job if you were being paid what your labor is worth.

Nova Scotia is going through some challenging times. The population's shrinking while it's aging. So, they have to pay government pensions and and other non-healthcare items with a decrease in funding. Also, older people take up more healthcare dollars. The vast majority of healthcare resources are spent in the first two and the last 20 years of a person's life. NS is dealing with a population that needs more and more care while getting less money as people move elsewhere for more opportunities.

Healthcare in Canada is federally funded and provincially administered. Treatments are funded by the government while hospitals are usually funded provincially. It's not uncommon in Canada for hospitals to do community fundraising for the upgrades they need.

YouShouldKnow,fcpfpul,t1_fcpds2e,1577861969.0,"In my youth, I used to hitchhike a lot. I've only had two sketchy rides. Both of those weren't on this trip. 

I'm, ahem, pretty gifted at packing light. So with a few choice clothing there's a lot that can stick in a backpack. Which is a long way of saying, I never went hungry. On this trip, I may have not eaten for around 18 hours. People would buy me food a lot. I was a clean, polite kid and could hold a conversation. If you ran into a kid that was like that in the middle of nowhere before cell phones, would you buy them food?

When I was a new hitchhiker at 17 people really tried to take care of me. On this trip there was a guy that drove me for a day or two. He was an older guy and when we parted, he gave me his number and offered to pick me up if I couldn't get a ride from where we parted. He was creepy enough that I didn't take him up on it. 

I did stay at a motel/strip joint that had a shooting or murder at it the week before.

Before I got to the strip club I tried to stay at a hostel which turned out to be a homeless shelter. At this one you had to check in before 7 and spend the rest of the night. It was a pretty sketchy city. It had a very high population of natives. Nothing against them, but I'm a white guy that had nice clothes. I was not like the 30-40 other people in that shelter. Everyone waited in the same room. Nobody talked. Everyone had their backs to the wall and we're sitting down. EVERYONE was staring at me. At some point a giant of a man walked in. He looked like a WEE wrestler, tall and massive dressed completely in white. He came over beside me and sat down close to me. EVERYONE stopped looking at me. I had zero idea if this was a good thing or an extremely bad thing. I mulled it over and decided to stay in a place where I could lock the doors. I didn't care if someone was murdered there before or not.
