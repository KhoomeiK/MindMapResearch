I've been in an abusive relationship & had very similar things happen to me. I understand how you can rationalize it and the behavior can start to feel normal. And you always think that if you can be better than this one little part of them (which is actually not so little, and actually quite scary) will go away & you'll just be left with the awesome guy that you're falling love with. But that is not what will happen. The kind of person that can blame you for hurting you, during sex of all things, is the type of person that will continue blame you, ultimately for every bad thing in their life.

puppy101,few7lbs,t3_eqjt3c,1579406482.0,"I'm hoping beyond hope that you're vet ruled out some of the most serious and common puppy viruses (listed below) and has determined your puppy just has a undetermined stomach irritant/bug (it's not always possible to figure out what causes gastroenteritis) and is not actually refusing to administer a simple blood test to determine if your puppy has these often fatal viruses. 

Here's some information for your knowledge which may be helpful this weekend in taking care of your puppy especially if you think it's parvovirus. A vet school in the US released an outpatient treatment protocol for parvovirus which I linked to below. Please note hospitalization is preferred.

As other users have said please hydrate hydrate hydrate! Chicken broth (make sure it's not cooked with things like onions or garlic) or Pedialyte (unflavored & no dye) can be better than water. Then introduce bland food like potatoes or chicken in really small amounts at a time as long as your puppy can keep them down & is not having diarrhea. 

**Parvovirus

Symptoms: https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/what-every-puppy-owner-needs-to-know-about-parvo-in-purluppies/

I'm just pointing out a fact about all abusive/narcissistic people so if a victim does come forward we don't discount what they're saying just because their abuser was nice to us."
BigBrother,fence1r,t1_feluh31,1579281677.0,"In my experience, abusive/narcissistic people tend to be incredibly charming in public. They care a lot about their reputation. Not saying anything is true or not true about him, but personally, I think his actions on the show are a lot more indicative than his brief interaction with you"
HumansBeingBros,fek4n3b,t3_eplii6,1579192515.0,I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sure your dad is really proud right now
BigBrother,fej2ieg,t1_fei11sw,1579154478.0,"How would you like her to substantiate that? It's illegal to record someone anywhere they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. If she posted pictures of bruises, broken furniture, etc he would just deny it. Perhaps you could prove emotional abuse through text messages. I'm just saying, super common for it to be unsubstantiated even if it did happen"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fe4cg6k,t3_ennn52,1578857830.0,"This really sounds like a dream to me. People feel like they ""fall"" in dreams all the time. It's because you wake up with a jolt. Dreaming about something you used to do all the time is common and dreams can feel very real. You were probably just tired and don't remember falling asleep. I agree it would be weird if your mom was like why are you here and your grandfather was like where are you. But no one else was freaked out."
dogs,fdhaixx,t1_fdhae95,1578418894.0,Good for you! I'm glad youre stepping up and helping. It's so sad how many people would look the other way.
dogs,fdh7kq5,t1_fdh6243,1578417098.0,"She swung it around by its legs? How is that perfectly fine. If someone did this to my dog...ðŸ¤¬ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜ ðŸ¤œ

Seriously call an animal rescue and ask them for help. Tell them everything. They'll be able to give you better guidance"
dogs,fdh7bpg,t3_ele34n,1578416943.0,"The dog is definitely being affected. This is fucking insane. Call a local animal rescue and ask them for help and if they wont (or if they tell you to) call the police! This is animal cruelty and in most countries it's against the law.

Also GTFO of that apartment as soon as you can because your roommate is a fucking psychopath. I hope someone treats them the way they're treating that dog"
NarcissisticAbuse,fdfvrd0,t3_ejyx8p,1578371518.0,"I have an ex who started out like that & it got progressively worse. You were SCARED of him! That is enough of a reason to leave & stay away. That is your gut telling you you were in danger and you needed to get out. I know I blocked a lot of things out, minimized things, and  honestly abuse just becomes normal. 

There are reasons you felt so on edge and scared. You don't deserve to feel that way again. You don't have to justify it to anyone just TRUST yourself, trust those feelings."
relationship_advice,fdfgfkh,t1_fdfasuw,1578361109.0,I think how you feel is fair and that's a great explanation. Tell him that & I think he'll understand. Though he may have just called you his girlfriend because it's easier than explaining that you're seeing each other exclusively but aren't bf/gf
relationship_advice,fdf9y0u,t3_el2o9d,1578356746.0,"In your mind, what's the difference? I'm not criticizing, I just want to understand"
relationship_advice,fdevw9t,t1_fdevcoi,1578347695.0,"Him asking for a reason is not the same as him deserving one. Tell him you not wanting to is enough of a reason, he's making you incredibly uncomfortable by harassing you about it and if he continues to do so you're done. And if does, break up with him.

Or just skip to the part where you break up with him because he sounds like a piece of shit."
relationship_advice,fdev3wr,t1_fdetnps,1578347230.0,That's ridiculous. Some people wait until marriage and many people wait months. If he can't wait he's not worth it. You don't have to explain yourself to him.
CasualConversation,fdefj01,t3_ekv8fu,1578337913.0,Wow. I don't really have any suggestions beyond what's already been said but I just wanted to say thank you for your sacrifice going to help those in need. I hope you stay safe.
dogs,fc9m3zu,t1_fc9l0x8,1577554723.0,Absolutely :)
dogs,fc9junv,t1_fc9hpky,1577553733.0,"Everyones situation is different & I'm definitely not judging anyone. But you asked what I would do. Personally, I would think that it's my responsibility to help my dog. There are millions of dogs that need help. So by giving that rescue their dog they'd be limiting their ability to help other dogs. They don't have limitless resources & I guarantee they won't get that money back adopting out that dog. And if I had no other choice, I would made sure I paid that rescue back with donations, even if it was only $5 a week, no matter how long it took. Honestly, that's what I would do. But again, I'm not judging anyone & I understand in many ways I'm a lot more fortunate than a lot of people (& less fortunate than others).

I had a dog that had cancer and I lived off pb&j sandwiches so I could get her treatment. It gave me no breathing room financially but I made it work. When I  adopted another dog when I knew even that wouldn't be possible (I was in school), I researched pet health insurance and got one that covered pretty much everything, got 90% coinsurance, and adopted her knowing that even if she needed a $20,000 treatment, I could scrimp and save $2000. 

Healthy Paws is an awesome insurance btw. They don't cover pre-existing obviously because otherwise they would go bankrupt with people getting insurance after their pets get sick instead of planning for the possibility. But they cover basically everything else & no lifetime max. In my experience they don't try to cheat you or scrimp at all"
dogs,fc70fec,t1_fc5u40e,1577494214.0,"Depends on the individual situation. I strongly disagree unless the dog is in pain and there is no way to get the dog help (they truly cannot financially, there's nothing cheaper they can do to help make the dogs quality of life better for as long as possible, and there's no one who can help). Otherwise yea, it's wrong. They agreed to care for that dog and now because it's expensive they just kill it? I'd never adopt a dog to a person like that"
dogs,fc6zvvn,t1_fc6ddiq,1577493804.0,I just want to say I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sure you did your best and your furbaby was very happy to be in your life
dogs,fc6zpag,t1_fc5ykms,1577493671.0,I hope people get pet insurance rather than planning to surrender their dog in the case of a large vet bill. Jeez
dogs,fbdpi50,t3_eckiui,1576768337.0,"If you're looking for things that *may* help. Denamarin is a good liver support supplement. I also really like country life liver support factors but you have to dose it for dogs. Potentially things to ask your vet.

I'm so sorry for what you're going through. Don't blame yourself. Dogs are tough and instinctively hide when they're sick. It's hard to tell. Just be there & focus on the present."
