dogs,ff1yrvj,t1_ff05r67,1579489295.0,Thanks for understanding. Rescue is very hard and often confusing.
dogs,ff1ylgw,t1_ff1r8xv,1579489172.0,I volunteer at a rescue in Vermont. Chiâ€™s get adopted so fast here that we canâ€™t keep up. I wish we had a connection to bring them from CA.
dogs,ff1yghc,t1_ff1ki8v,1579489076.0,"I know that the current population of greyhounds are suffering from that, but I think that in the long run more dogs will be spared from having to live that life. I think it was a good thing that that law passed."
dogs,ff1y3h9,t1_ff0azvf,1579488827.0,"I volunteer at a shelter where we have three dogs that have been there longer than that. We had four, but one got adopted two days ago after being there two years. I havenâ€™t cried that hard in a while. It was a great day."

doggos,fckqtc8,t3_ehpitl,1577731196.0,I volunteer at a rescue in Vermont and am constantly amazed at the amount of straight up perfect dogs that come to us. Itâ€™s crazy to me to think of how many more must be out there at shelters & rescues just waiting for homes.
