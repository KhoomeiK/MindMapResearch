norsemythology,ffift9m,t3_ettd39,1579972845.0,"Heyhey redditors of norse mythology knowledge!
I am a norse mythology enthusiast but still a novice at that.

Not too long ago i came across this depiction in a norse mythology inspired game, which has tonnes of ""easter eggs"" directed towards poéttic edda norse mythology with actual 1/1 references from for example runestones in sweden etc.

I devote quite a bit of my spare time to find out as much as i can about norse mythology, overall i enjoy the process of finding out things for myself, it very rewarding.

But this is the first depiction i can't seem to place, most obvious to me it would be a copy from a runestone, but I'm having a hard time finding it. Not to say it has to be from a runestone, but this was my first guess.

Maybe some of you know which norse animal is depicted in here and can tell me something about it :)

Thank you"

Nothing to do with tobacco itself."

Which is actually good and bad... good because the area is a clean environment where people do their best to maintain that, bad because any wild life picking up litter (that very small amount that doesn't get recycled) should never be a thing in the first place.... read that as a loss of habitat."
