Bad editing (to long between each clip, just bad in general imo). Messed up during free building and tunneling but you still put it in the montage?"
noveltranslations,fexo0kx,t3_eqgf9z,1579433808.0,"Thriller Paradise

Part of it is on Qidian but it isn’t locked (first 5 chapters are missing in Qidian however).

Similar to Terror Infinity, however less intense / terror driven (no constant threat of death). It’s more focused on the MC solving puzzles/acting as a detective. Executed decently well as the author isn’t only make him seem smart. 

Also read the 3 new wuxiaworlds KRs. Disappointing for the most part, specifically Dungeon Predator. Everyone Young is kinda decent."

noveltranslations,fecr6u8,t1_fe5maf2,1578981566.0,It’s on webnovel (Qidian). If you want to read for free use the underground
LivestreamFail,fdhlapm,t1_fdhapsg,1578425060.0,You keep your momentum for one hop though
LivestreamFail,fdhaijc,t1_fdha16o,1578418888.0,"No, they allow you to bhop but only allow it once so you can’t travel far"
LivestreamFail,fdh91lu,t1_fdgvgr4,1578418012.0,That’s false. They only limited it to one hop
FortNiteBR,fdb6i55,t1_fdak9nr,1578254382.0,Yeah it’s way too OP
FortniteCompetitive,fd8sn3t,t1_fd8lirw,1578222880.0,It’s a lot harder to predict where somebody will be in 2 seconds vs .5
FortniteCompetitive,fd8seqf,t3_ek99gq,1578222770.0,Cross post it to FortniteBR instead of fortnitecompetitive for it to gain attention there’s already enough pointless stuff in this sub
facepalm,fcys8m1,t1_fcyfkyh,1578085971.0,I don’t get why people are supporting him. He was listed as a known terrorist by the US. He’s not a good person
noveltranslations,fcwfbiv,t1_fcw0bbs,1578024163.0,Yeah I loved One Man Army as well
noveltranslations,fcw6fqa,t1_fcw49vm,1578018230.0,"Yeah, translators have been posting their own content more (MSM and most ENs) but also posts typically have an officiallish format that’s annoying to do (especially when you are on mobile like me)"
noveltranslations,fcw3vzs,t1_fcw2r39,1578016552.0,"Yeah, the announcement (https://www.wuxiaworld.com/post/dungeon-predator/dungeon-predator-has-been-released) already has quite a few comments so as soon as they make a official announcement I can see it getting a lot of upvotes"
noveltranslations,fcw0n1g,t1_fcvzvu3,1578014409.0,Yep. Kinda surprised though that the new KR from Wuxiaworld didn’t get this hype with the poll and announcement (I don’t even think it got posted). Especially since their KRs are some of (if not the most) popular novels around
noveltranslations,fcvxxdy,t1_fcu10rb,1578012621.0,"Not surprising honestly, but kind of weird that Worlds Greatest Militia is #9 here but ~150th at novel updates. After the launch it pretty much fell from its hype"
noveltranslations,fcvccsd,t3_eiwe8e,1577999132.0,What happened to SSS-Class hero?

noveltranslations,fco9rqf,t3_ei8pkj,1577826994.0,Most of the popular female MC novels had their translations move to qidian causing it not to be up there in NovelUpdates. Just a year or two ago they were far more common. There’s quite a few still (4 of top 20 are Female MC). Just less popular
noveltranslations,fclmogn,t1_fcclpiw,1577751388.0,Any other decent KRs on Qidian? I enjoyed 3 Meals and starting emperor of steel now.
