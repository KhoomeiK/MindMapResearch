One night they had a fight and he came over to my place to try and chill after. We were sitting around smoking cones and playing games. We were crowded around tge TV, all of our attention on the game. I turned to hand the controller to my mate and his girlfriend had snuck in the back door and was now standing behind her boyfriend, my mate,  with a hammer raised over her head and a look of absolute crazed fury on her face, ready to strike. I was the only one looking at her and our eyes locked. I was so high and for some reason, I have no idea why, this tableaux struck me as absolutely hilarious. I then  collapsed into a fit of stoned laughter. Luckily this was somehow the right thing to do at this time as the girlfriend just ran off crying. All parties involved are now happy and healthy."
