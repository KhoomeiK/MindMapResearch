aww,fehlps3,t3_ep3shu,1579119094.0,I see you wanted some easy updoots. No reason to take your dog to the airport just to show off how much it missed the owner. Every dog does this dude lol

istp,fege2r1,t3_eolmpd,1579089485.0,"Saying what I'm thinking out loud more, even if it's just a comment like ""oh I like the color of that so and so""
us ISTPs do mostly internal thinking, so this will help you to be more comfy with speaking your mind. I just went to ohayocon, a big anime expo in Ohio, and this was something I had to do big time as I was in costume and had to be in character. Try and push yourself out of your comfort zone"

istp,fcrqm8m,t1_fcrp6k3,1577905304.0,"I've always like something with good bass, specifically artists like swae Lee and Don toliver. I've also always enjoyed metalcore and anything heavy. I love the intensity of music whether it's sadness anger etc., if the song conveys a strong feeling of emotion (not usually lyrically), I'll gravitate to it. In fact, I don't really enjoy Eminem and other rappers with emphasis on lyricism because I can't connect to it, it feels too much like work to enjoy and the beat is usually weak"
