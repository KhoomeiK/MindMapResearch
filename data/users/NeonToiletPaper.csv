AdviceAnimals,fe8hadf,t1_fe8dmuy,1578926120.0,7 years ago I was making $7.25. Now I make closer to $30 an hour with only a 2 year degree and a job I found on an internet job board. It's completely possible if you are capable of using your experience to leverage better jobs.
leagueoflegends,fdhg414,t1_fdgj0c0,1578421912.0,It also proc's tiamat as well. Empowered Titanic hydra proc on a buckler is one of my favorite interactions in the game.
