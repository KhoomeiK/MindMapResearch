JUSTNOMIL,fg8lx3o,t3_exdbny,1580623786.0,"Ignore some of these comments you're getting about being trashy. You weren't being trashy, if anything your MIL and SIL are for being violent first. Taking your baby away by force is violence. And slapping the fuck out of her is exactly what I would have done in panic to ward off any notion that she could reach back for that baby, like an instinctual defense move. That being said, you could get in trouble for assault because lawfully all of you committed it and even though I understand momma bear rage, the law is a fiddly bitch. I highly suggest no contact. If cops come around be cordial but keep your mouth shut bc they aren't your friends. If CPS gets involved tell them what happened and emphasize that she forcefully and physically took your baby without your parental consent and that your SIL physically assaulted you as well. They violated the safety and consent of your parenthood."
changemyview,fg8hz79,t1_fg7glpl,1580620062.0,"I am pro-trans rights. But I'm thinking OP has hit a rough topic that has me questioning how lines get crossed. I think an additional point to consider is that some people/ a lot of people are also religious in some fashion which has me wondering something. 

So I am an atheist but I know a lot of people who believe in gods. As we know, religiousness isn't always on our sleeves and a lot of people are 'spiritual' Christian's or Muslims, etc. And sex in their minds is usually tied concretely to gender. Is it a violation of someone's consent if they kiss another person who isn't cis? Kissing is rarely if ever considered pre-marital sin but a lot of under informed people would view kissing a transwoman as homosexuality regardless of post-Operative changes because of how that person was born. I dont agree with those types of views but I feel like it boils down to proper consent. I know trans people are at increased risk of violence and murder... but my gut tells me that consent is the crux of the issue, and while we should do our best to spread positive awareness of trans people and their human rights, it can't always be the onus of the person who isn't aware their love interest is trans. I just dont see that, sadly, as practical if consent is important."

I heard my own name loudly in my left ear while driving. I knew it wasn't real bc wtf would i say my own name alone and the only thing next to me was the closed window and no one else in my car. I've never heard anything else like that before or since. The only other thing I've experienced was what some people describe as 'a loud explosion' in my head that scared the shit out of me when I was falling asleep (I knew it wasn't real bc my husband confirmed)

todayilearned,ffy638m,t1_ffxzsbm,1580339265.0,We lived the same life. Went to Sevier County and moved to Louisiana. I was in my senior year in Louisiana and felt like I got downgraded to the worst education attempt in the USA. Like went from really cool history projects and playing a part in Shakespeare play in Sevierville to Louisiana and only getting a packet of worksheets that my teacher couldn't be assed to explain properly bc she was usually lucky anybody gave a shit enough to turn in.
todayilearned,ffy557k,t1_ffxkmii,1580338736.0,I went to high school in Sevierville and the graduating number was very high. A lot of families have also moved there from other parts of the country so there's a good influx of positivity in education. Sure there's the standard hillbillies of old families in the area but the that number is dwarfed by new-to-town families.

You are the sum total of a waste of breath as an employee if you are not selling a credit card or talking someone into signing a loan of whatever kind is available. They calculate they will lose less money by firing and replacement hiring/training than any kind of lawsuit their chode brains can come up with. It was soul sucking and I'm glad I left. It literally left me with exhausting depression.

raisedbynarcissists,fei6qda,t3_ep55hh,1579131514.0,"I get along with my Dad but he's definitely a Narc. I dont have to post or vent because, generally, he's funny and a nice person... but I struggle making deep connections with him. Everything is about him and he tells fibs constantly to make himself look better, to the point where I have (sometimes to my own great amusement) had to tell him that he can't lie to me because I WAS THERE and he's lying. He is reliable if I need help but I can only handle him in short doses or he grates on my nerves.



I still have to say I'd do anything for him and our relationship is good but that's because his narcissism isn't so destructive as others. We manage... with a lot of patience from my side.

Edit: Mine used to be borderline neglectful when it came to my childhood. I stopped asking him to go to my school functions and learned he was my dad only when it was his weekend. It took me living with him full time as a teen (divorced and he lived in different state) for him to notice me as a real life person. So it could have been worse but I totally get the guilt about feeling like he wasn't horrible enough to be considered a narcissist."
