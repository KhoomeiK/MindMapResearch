Kotlin,fcl2wpi,t1_fckuz40,1577738638.0,"Looking at the code, I have some suggestions:

1. Don't use lazy for trivial computations (`isInvertible`, `isUnit`, …). Use a getter instead.

2. Use `operator fun` for the operators.

3. Don't override auto-generated methods unless the implementation is different."
Kotlin,fcl1rpu,t3_ehqe4e,1577737936.0,"Why do you override functions that are auto-generated? (`hashCode` and `equals` may have sense but not the others.)

A data class is a data storage, not a data processor; processing the data should be someone else's concern. The smaller the class is, the more versatile it is and the easier it is to test it. Ideally, a data class should not need any tests because it should not contain any logic (besides the auto-generated which you don't need to test).

Generally, you should use extension functions instead because they don't change the API of the class and separate concerns. I would not put even transformations in there (a data class does not need to know about other data structures), unless you need the class to implement an interface, and for that, unless it is trivial (e.g. unit conversion), I would use dependency injection to separate the actual logic out of the data class."

androiddev,fc4py8z,t1_fc3x4df,1577424231.0,"If it's a view state then it should be in the view part of MVVM (a View/Fragment/Activity) and use `onSaveInstanceState` or equivalent. If it is a data state that is worth preserving indefinitely then it should be in the model. If MVVM is properly implemented, there should never be a state worth saving in the View Model, it should just convert data to other data (whether they are obtained from the model or the view). The limitations may seem self-imposed but they are quite important if you want to have unit-testable code."
androiddev,fc3x38p,t1_fbp0ss7,1577400861.0,"You don't. `onSaveInstanceState` is supposed to save view state (and Android views do that for you), not the model, the bundle is not backed up. In the model, you can use e.g. Shared Preferences, they take care of working correctly with the lifecycle."
