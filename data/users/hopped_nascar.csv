Please be honest but not harsh lol, I need others opinions. It might be a little difficult to understand what I’m saying so hears the lyrics:

I’m broken hearted 
There’s no time for restarting 
Whats the use of fixing it if the problem’s not worth solving.
It was love
She’s really all that I thought of
But the childish fatuations
Kept my mind into its order
Enjoy the summer cause you’ll fall right into autumn
Leaves are orange
It’s so pretty seeing all these leaves dead 
Then it’s winter
Hot coco let’s see what this season brings 
Cold days, snowflakes 
Followed by the pretty spring.
Tryna move my momma from 06 elgrand to a new fancy humma limousine, 
with a house on the hills living lavish near the sea 
but most important never ever losing love and honesty. I hope to never be blinded by all the hate, the lies that navigate that I seem to gravitate towards, all the rumours they shape, but in the end, on my finger rests the little pretty bird that I was singing for.."

The funny thing was, on the invitation, it said that children weren’t allowed to attend because it was a bar and that they didn’t want toys or clothes, they wanted cash. He was a really good friend of mine and I wasn’t even allowed to go to his birthday party. I feel really bad for him because the party probably went like this. Doors open, everyone enters, family speaks, birthday kid says something, cut cake, everyone sings, kid is happy, everyone starts to drink, kid sits with no one he knows, no other kids, just drunk adults, cries, day is over and kid is sad, parents are happy, kid remember this day as the worst birthday ever."
