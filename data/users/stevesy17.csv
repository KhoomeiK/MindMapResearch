Pathfinder2e,ffbzpwc,t1_ffb2kyi,1579787776.0,"They weren't claiming that you were claiming you could use a potion in 0 actions. Drinking a potion in 1 action (which you ARE claiming) means that you are drawing the potion as a free action (which you can't do).

If the potion is in your backpack, you have to take off the backpack (1^st action), draw the potion (2^nd action), and drink it (3^rd action).

If it's in a bando, it's draw the potion (1^st action) and drink it (2^nd action). There. Using the bandolier has saved you 1 action.

>A bandolier can be dedicated to a full set of tools, such as healer’s tools,

""Such as healer's tools"" does imply that there are other acceptable things, but it still refers back to ""a full set of tools"", which is very limited in its interpretation. To interpret that as potions is clearly outside of its intent. It's talking about tool kits only. I read it the way you did initially cause I wanted it to be that good, but it's just not that good. If there was only one tool kit in the game, you might have an argument. But since there are a number of items that are all considered tool kits, it's very clear.

>allowing you to draw the tools as part of the action that requires them.

It's talking about tool kits. You *only* get to draw tool kits as part of the action that requires them.

As far as bulk, specific trumps general. The bandolier specifically says it holds a tool kit, so it does. Simple as that."

I understand that the dreadnought is on a higher plane, that's perfectly fine. But by your very point, if you watch it again, they show you the turbolasers themselves firing from very close up perspective, and they are quite obviously pointed above 0 degrees on the supremacy's plane. If their target is below that plane, as you say it is, there is no way they are firing straight.

Look, I'm not saying that this makes TLJ a terrible movie. There are other more important things that do that. It just belies a filmmaker that doesn't really care about internal consistency. The hyperspace maneuver is an ever greater example. While it produced probably my favorite imagery when the supremacy is destroyed, it makes absolutely zero sense. Hyperspace hopping in ROS is more of the same. All in all, the new trilogy was made by people that really didn't seem to care about much other than making billions of dollars."

>**Heightened (4th)** Your battle form is Large and your attacks have 10-foot reach. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. You instead gain 15 temporary HP, AC = 18 + your level, attack modifier +16, damage bonus +9, and Athletics +16.

>**Heightened (5th)** Your battle form is Huge and your attacks have 15-foot reach. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. You instead gain 20 temporary HP, AC = 18 + your level, attack modifier +18, damage bonus +7 and double the number of damage dice, and Athletics +20.

These specific effects are linked to those specific spell levels, so the first effect it a 3rd level spell and does exactly that, then the next is a 4th level spell, and so on.



Magic missile however reads

>**Heightened (+2)** You shoot one additional missile with each action you spend.

Magic missile is level one. So this means that you can heighten it to level 3, level 5, level 7, and level 9. Each time you bump it up like that, you apply the improvement again. So at first level, it's one missile per action, 3rd it's two, all the way up to 5 missiles per action at level 9."
