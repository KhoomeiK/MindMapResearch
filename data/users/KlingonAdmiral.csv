todayilearned,ffdionl,t1_ffdgtx7,1579821692.0,"Yes. The roads of the Inca Empire were dotted by tambos (""inns"") about a day of walking distance away from each other, which probably also served as some sort of low-level administrative center. A chasqi - messenger - would be sent out from such a facility, run towards the next, and give the message to another chasqi, which would then run to the next tampu. Each chasqui carried a conch sheel as a sort of trumpet by which he would signal his imminent arrival to the tampu so that the next runner would already be prepared to immediately depart.

It is estimated that this system allowed the Inca to transmit messages at a speed of about 240 kilometers per day - twice what Roman *ships* were capable of."

If you're not interested in playing Muslims or playing in India in CK2 you don't need that DLC. If you're not interested in playing a MegaCorp or a Machine Empire you don't need that DLC for Stellaris.

This doesn't really apply the EU4 though, which *generally* releases ""generalist"" DLC which in some way or another affect all countries in the game.

For example, El Dorado might not interest you if you play mainly in India, until you decide to play a meme-y colonial Vijayanagar run. Suddenly you want that expansion.

And the EU4 community wants those ""generalist"" DLCs. Third Rome, the DLC most closeley resembling expansions like Swords of Islam or Synthetic Dawn, is generally regarded as one of the poorer additions to the game."
