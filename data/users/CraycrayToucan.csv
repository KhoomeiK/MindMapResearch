I say 3 because if you are familiar with meat, there's a difference between a New York strip steak and a slab of chuck. They are both meat, but they behave very differently, though they will behave pretty similarly in burger form. Lab grown meat may be real meat materials, but if they aren't arranged and marbled like a strip steak, we aren't going to want to eat them like steak so much."

Overdose on Adderall isn't something I've heard of, but you can overdose on anything if you try hard enough. Even water. I've not heard of it having the same addictive properties as street drugs. I took it for ten years. I'm still on the fence as to it's use. I felt more productive, and got better and better grades than I ever had before. But it's not hard to argue I was simply growing up and getting more responsible.

Last I read, studies show that people FEEL smarter and more productive on Adderall, but don't seem to actually exhibit measurable improvements on intelligence tests.

Our entire understanding of what psychotropic drugs do to your brain is still pretty theoretical. We mostly rely on observed and reported mental state changes, which is pretty unreliable compared to other scientific study. As advanced as we are, we are still pretty much playing around with building blocks of mental health saying ""what does THIS do?"" We are light years ahead of where we were 100 years ago, heck, even just 40 years ago. But we are by no means at a place where our main theories are beyond being challenged."

Particularly if you are considering ""how much I will enjoy X"" compared to ""how much X costs."" Not to mention it's not ethically wrong to consider the good you might do for someone else with those funds. Giving me a pizza while I was working through my undergrad would have given me more joy than you can easily understand. I could barely afford food. And that was only a $10 pizza.

But he also gives people the impression that filtration, heating, and fertilizing are completely unnecessary for a happy, healthy, planted fish tank. And that's not true for all situations. My house gets cold in winter. Without a heater my tank would drop to 60 degrees or less. Most fish can survive that, but surviving is not thriving. Many of the fish in our hobby are going to be unhappy or unhealthy in such low temperatures. And filtration can play an important role, even in planted tanks. Lastly, Walstad method is great, but eventually nutrients run out, and fertilizing will allow you to grow so many more species. The reason Foo doesn't use some plants is because he's primarily using the plants that can survive in nutrient-limited environments.

I wish you could just remove three inches off the left side of the tank. Instead I'd consider putting a second, smaller rise, with stone in the back left corner. If you don't have more stone, consider removing the slope of soil from that corner. It just hints at stone that should be there, but isn't present. Slopes and stone should always go together.
