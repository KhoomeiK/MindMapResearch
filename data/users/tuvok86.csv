but we don't really know, they could very well release it in a couple months and add a proper tour/bunch of dates to the list! this wave of announcements was pretty much forced because EOTR lineup was unveiled this morning."

*The more frequently you replace your lenses, the healthier and more comfortable your eyes can be.*

*Protein, calcium, lipids and other substances found naturally in your tears can build up on your lenses. These deposits make your contacts less comfortable than when they were new, and can also make your eyes more prone to infection.*

*Of course, lenses can be cleaned, but cleaning is not 100 percent effective. Some deposits will remain and continue to accumulate over time.*
