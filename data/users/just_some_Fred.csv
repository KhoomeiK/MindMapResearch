I honestly don't begrudge them the suspension with pay bit, I just wish other unions had as good protection for their people, and union representation was more widespread.

> Antisemitism in the Soviet Union commenced openly as a campaign against the ""rootless cosmopolitan""[3] (a supposed euphemism for ""Jew""). In his speech titled ""On Several Reasons for the Lag in Soviet Dramaturgy"" at a plenary session of the board of the Soviet Writers' Union in December 1948, Alexander Fadeyev equated the cosmopolitans with the Jews.[25][note 2] In this campaign against the ""rootless cosmopolitan"", many leading Jewish writers and artists were killed.[3] Terms like ""rootless cosmopolitans"", ""bourgeois cosmopolitans"", and ""individuals devoid of nation or tribe"" (all of which were codewords for Jews) appeared in newspapers.[25][note 3] The Soviet press accused the Jews of ""groveling before the West"", helping ""American imperialism"", ""slavish imitation of bourgeois culture"" and ""bourgeois aestheticism"".[25][note 4] Victimization of Jews in the USSR at the hands of the Nazis was denied, Jewish scholars were removed from the sciences, and emigration rights were denied to Jews.[27] The Stalinist antisemitic campaign ultimately culminated in the Doctors' plot in 1953. According to Patai and Patai, the Doctors' plot was ""clearly aimed at the total liquidation of Jewish cultural life"".[3] Communist antisemitism under Stalin shared a common characteristic with Nazi and fascist antisemitism in its belief in ""Jewish world conspiracy"".[28]

Granted, antisemitism was officially banned, but it still continued. Saying that the USSR wasn't antisemitic is like saying racism in the US stopped when the 1964 civil rights act was passed."
