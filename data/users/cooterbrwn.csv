In general, enough things are automatic or GUI based to get your feet wet, but if you're not approaching it (assuming you're fairly new to *nix) as a learning experience, it's going to be frustrated. 

From that point of frustration, you can either scrap it, rely simply on step-by-step guides that are available online, or actually take the time to dig in and learn how the system works. 

I do see several people who essentially want to dive into *nix because they claim they're tired of how Windows tries to automate everything, but then complain because *nix automates so little. While a ""happy medium"" would be awesome, that's a very subjective measurement. FreeNAS comes close, but it's still going to require a bit of a learning process to do what you're asking of it, since the things you're talking about are actually ""advanced operations"" for an OS that was initially built to handle NAS duties.
