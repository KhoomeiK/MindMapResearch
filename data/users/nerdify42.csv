He did breed her with someone's boxer and they had beautiful puppies.

Well, one shelter we drove an hour to go see, it was a terrier. The lady at the desk said a co-worker kept changing the description on the website so more people would be interested. I didn't connect with that dog, though. I did find my corgi a couple of weeks later. She's not full blood, but people who see her know she's mostly corgi.

Words from someone who's worn glassed for 25 years... I've had some cheap frames last years, but the lenses were scratched to hell because I couldn't afford the upgrades to get better lenses. I just got two new pairs at a cheap store, and at the lowest end. I wasn't happy at first, and I had to take them both back to be adjusted. The lenses were popping out on one pair and were So tight they gave me a headache. 

There's a really informative episode of ""Adam Ruins Everything"" that talks about how like 80% of glasses are all Luxotica anyway. Be it $20 or $200 frames. Anyway, the place you got them from should be able to repair the problems you described. Most glasses come with a warranty."
