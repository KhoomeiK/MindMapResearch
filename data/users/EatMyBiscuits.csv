I don’t understand your issue now though (and won’t pursue it that far). Your Sony exec doesn’t dispute these commenters. The Sony exec just said it’s unproductive to include the marketing budget in the films recoupables - he didn’t comment on budget ratios. 

In this case, they are talking about specific films that have astronomical marketing budgets. In my time I’ve worked on blockbuster films that have had $100+ million marketing budgets. Which in that case would have been ~50% of the production budget. And also films with high tens of millions on a similar production budget, which would be 100%.

I’ve never worked on a film with 200% marketing budget, but the example in that thread is Get Out, which was super low budget to begin with."
movies,fd49a0a,t1_fd3fbyb,1578165528.0,"I’m not confused. I know you aren’t saying that marketing is 2x budget. But I also know that the people you are attributing that idea to aren’t actually saying that either. 

What they are actually saying (right or wrong) is:

Total recoupable cost = production budget + marketing budget + cinema costs

Which is often described in shorthand as:

Total recoupable cost = production budget x2

That’s is not the same as your descriiption:

marketing budget = 2x budget

Which reads as, marketing costs are budgeted at twice the production costs, not that the total costs are production plus marketing, as above.

I genuinely think you just wrote it in a slightly confusing way, but what you originally wrote (which is the only argument I’m making) doesn’t describe the argument of your examples."
movies,fd3bp0y,t1_fd3aiks,1578156704.0,"Fuck. Me. 

I’m not saying you *believe* that, I’m saying no one is even saying that. No one.

Your example said the recoupable was 2.5 times the production budget. It didn’t mention how much the marketing budget was. You original statement was that these people think that the **marketing budget** equals **two times** the production budget. 

The recoupable is marketing budget **PLUS** the production budget."
movies,fd38a1s,t1_fd33k8l,1578155708.0,"Dude, wtf are you talking about?

movies,fd301j5,t1_fd2uaqe,1578153410.0,"As I said, if that is your example, you have misunderstood or misstated.

They are saying that to break even you have take the production budget and times it by 2.5 (more normally listed as 2), to take into account the cinema cut of the box office and sometimes the marketing spend (which is often not included, and means the film needs a to make even more on top of the stated budget to break even).

That is not what you said. You said people think the marketing budget is equal to two times the production budget. It isn’t. The marketing budget is usually a fraction of the production budget. Sometimes a large fraction, but (probably) never more than.

Again, if that isn’t what you meant, you misstated."
