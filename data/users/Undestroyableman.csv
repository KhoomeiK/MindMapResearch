CSRRacing2,feopi81,t3_eq4q15,1579303527.0,"Swapping is when 2 racers agree to lose one race then win the other (swaps swapping W/L)  etc etc for as long as you have gas and a person willing to swap with you. 

There are.some out there who say they swap and dont but that is mostly in the lower lobbies (over 9.5 seconds I have found). Usually in the faster lobbies you will find more players that honourably swap."
