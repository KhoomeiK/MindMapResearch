fatlogic,feyrg2e,t1_fev97zp,1579449726.0,"Thanks - these are interesting articles. If the research indicates that it's more ""addiction-like"" and more behavioral-based than substance-based, I'm not sure that's a distinction that matters much for people who are chronically overeating. (I do think the fine points and accuracy are very important, though and don't mean to gloss over those.) One point the first article made was that real addiction isn't susceptible to devaluation - unpleasant side-effects didn't prevent rats from consuming the drug. I would argue that morbid obesity and social stigma should be deterrents, but aren't. They also said that (with respect to food)  behaviors are only engendered in a specific intermittent access regime, and environmental cues aren't present - such as acute stress or drug exposure. Not all overeaters binge - they just eat a lot more frequently, and are hungry more frequently. And acute stress seems to be very much a trigger for overeating, from the anecdotal evidence. I'm not sure how ""drug exposure"" is missing as an environmental cue, since the presence of hyperpalatable food stimulates cravings and hunger.  Strictly speaking, the neurological aspects of sugar consumption aren't identical to drugs, but cocaine, heroin, and nicotine aren't identical to each other. Nonetheless, points well taken.

I readily admit that I'm not a scientist and my arguments are based mostly on personal experience/observation as an alcoholic and as a person who has been able to control overeating and cravings by avoiding certain carbs or carb/fat combinations. Anyway, I appreciate your sharing these.  One thing I thought was really interesting was that the rats with constant access to sugary foods still didn't get fat. Hmmm."

There are a lot of people here who can probably quote, chapter and verse, what she says, why it's wrong, and the study she used to push her agenda. I do think the message has gotten more warped in the hands of the FAs.  I'd like to read the book, and I'm curious why she chose this path."
