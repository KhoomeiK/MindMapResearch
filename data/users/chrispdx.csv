We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me."""

I understand that it is frustrating when I have to pick someone up at Dig a Pony, Romtoms, Dante's, Portland City Grill, Star Theater, etc. and there is LITERALLY nowhere for me to stop that isn't blocking traffic in some way. I get it. I hate having to do it. But there are cases where it is unavoidable. I will say that if a rider is not standing outside ready to get in within 10-15 seconds, I will drive around the block. And yes, as I have been doing so, I've been called by the rider yelling at me for not waiting and I have to both apologize and potentially eat a sub-5 star rating, plus destroy any opportunity for a tip. These are the instant choices that I have to make in the interest of everyone. And to be honest, asking the rider to walk to a more safe place to be picked up, even if it is less than a few hundred feet away, is usually an argument. Riders know they have all the power when it comes to the rider/driver relationship. I've been screamed at for not getting to a location fast enough when there's heavy traffic. I've had riders sneak open containers into my car and drunkenly spill them all over my back seat. I've had bicyclists pound on my hood and top because I didnt see them coming up a half a mile away while I was picking up a rider on a side street. Bottom line, driving in inner Portland can be a shitshow, especially at night. But that's where the money is, and that's why we do what we do: for the money. We also keep drunk drivers off the road.

Yes, there are some poor, uncaring Uber and Lyft drivers out there who will block traffic for full minutes with hazards on (sometimes, other times they just stop with no indicater), and would probably sell their mothers for a fare. We call them ""mules"". We hate them as much as you do. When possible, we report them for their behavior. But our power is limited, and we do what we can to make everyone happy, and sometimes we fail. I'm sorry."
