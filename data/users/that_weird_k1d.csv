aww,feimqru,t1_fei3w70,1579142157.0,"Salmonella, yeah."
aww,feiminj,t1_fehofh4,1579142005.0,"Actually, because most of the quokka population lives on Rottnest island and the only mainland population that I know of (there might be more, idk) has already been decimated, it would be better to protect animals native to the east coast or au."
MadeOfStyrofoam,feidbhi,t3_ep4aj1,1579135843.0,Next time (not that you should cut) try hiding them in a couch cushion or somewhere equally random. The likelyhood of someone finding it is very low.
MadeOfStyrofoam,fed37on,t3_eohhdd,1578996541.0,"If I were you I’d write it down, it might be easier than possibly breaking down crying or chickening out."
SelfHarmScars,feczp5w,t1_fecst6f,1578991441.0,That’s great!
SelfHarmScars,fecrniy,t1_fe7kclk,1578982029.0,"Ah. How are the fires going, have you been affected? I’ve had small fires nearby but nothing within about 15/20 kms."
selfharm,fecr86e,t1_feafcwy,1578981602.0,"Me toooooooo. Also it’s very hard to get into performing arts programs, only about 1 in ten of the talented people’s work with (I take classes) are in programs, so please don’t freak out if you don’t get in. I hate the idea of someone my own age killing themselves because of some teacher not seeing their potential."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fe7ce38,t3_enzrm1,1578912746.0,"A N Y Twenty Øne Piløts song,  but songs from Vessel and Trench are nice. Also Hobo Johnson has some good songs, try sorry my dear or Creve couer 1.
Edit- forgot to mention that sorry my dear has strong mentions of suicide so be careful with that one."
SelfHarmScars,fe7aqoh,t1_fe76lpb,1578912170.0,That would be true. Where would that mean you are then?

selfharm,fe6rmkl,t3_enz9a3,1578902127.0,"hey. I really can’t help with the suicidal thoughts or anything (try calling a helpline). But with the not crying afterwards, I’m the same. I just become an emotionless rock for about half an hour. It’s probably normalish, so don’t freak out over that. Try to stay safe, and please please please don’t kill yourself."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fe6qoql,t3_enz4l3,1578900892.0,  We do tend to have flawed logic on that front.

selfharm,fe03cnd,t3_enhrim,1578802040.0,"You say you are eleven, do you go to high school or primary? I (13f) found that my high school has lots of resources for people like us. I am happy to talk via insta or reddit if that would help you, but I would also recommend going onto the kids helpline website for your country, as they usually have resources for people dealing with self harm or suicide. This is only what I know of Western Australia though so..."
SelfHarmScars,fdu672e,t1_fdu5vj4,1578728275.0,"I haven’t tried it (my scars are small and don’t bother me) but a few years ago my sister got a gash on her thigh that needed about 16 stitches and after using bio oil it has almost faded, so I think it does work."
SelfHarmScars,fdu4mhj,t3_emx5re,1578727463.0,There’s this thing called bio oil for scars and stretch marks that helps fade them.
SelfHarmScars,fdu2w5i,t3_emx2w3,1578726564.0,My sister has that bracelet.
MadeOfStyrofoam,fddcwbp,t3_eks3pl,1578306215.0,"Don’t worry. I’ve seen so many people on this subreddit talking about carving stuff into themselves. You’re going to be ok. I carved my friend and her boyfriend’s initials into my chest. We can be normal people and still do stuff like that. 
Stay safe."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fddclyx,t3_ekrdog,1578305789.0,"I know it’s horrible of me, and I’m probably a psycho for this, but I wish my parents cared less. It’s tearing my mum apart and I wish my parents would just let me do what I want to do in life. And I don’t want to hurt them if I eventually kill myself."

AskReddit,fd7gtcy,t3_ek232m,1578204277.0,I watched a movie last night called H is for Happiness. It is a childrens/family movie but I found it really good and dealt with themes of depression and suicide.
blursedimages,fd7duli,t3_ek2wxb,1578202939.0, The fact that I know what type of moth that originally was scares me.

selfharm,fd0ps3p,t3_ejoy8v,1578122124.0," When my parents found out that I had been cutting that palms of my hands (very shallow, never bled) they freaked out a little but it was only really a half hour chat and it was forgotten. Also if your cuts aren’t in a straight line and look haphazard you could always say you fell into a plant or something. I suggest you stop cutting as it is a bad coping mechanism and will only get worse, but if you must, move to cutting your legs or stomach as it is easier to hide."

AskReddit,fb4l5x0,t1_fb2rpq1,1576511003.0,I'm a teenage lesbian Australian and I disagree. Everyone here has seen enough american tv to know all the gay stereotypes and everyone usually has their mum's gay colleague who has a fiancee somewhere that they love bringing into conversation whenever you mention it.
