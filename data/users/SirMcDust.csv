dankmemes,ff789jk,t1_ff73wp3,1579643069.0,"Yeah I’m with you there. I consider myself already spoiled and then I look around me. 

Seeing parents argue with their toddlers nowadays is a joke. 

Kid wanted sweets and instead of asking just takes them.

The mother goes: No, don’t do that you’re not allowed.

So the kids proceeds to eat the sweets.

Mother: Please stop now.

Kid keeps on eating. (Was around 4 to 5 years old by the way)

It’s the small things like that imo. I know parenting is hard and I doubt I could do it any better, but damn you can’t give your 5 year old complete freedom and ask them not to do things. 

Obviously children need to learn to become self sufficient at some point but I doubt that is the right age to start at."

That’s why he very talkative during battle. Because there he can be himself."

SmashBrosUltimate,fel2y8u,t1_fel2s7e,1579212921.0,"It’s the small things, similar he also when he speaks often has the option of being incredible sassy right? Might be another link to the theme as when he speaks some people might not like it thus he is quiet instead."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel2r0w,t1_feka7gy,1579212798.0,"I actually was looking forward to Byleth because of how unique he/she can be with her combination of the whip sword and white magic.

I truly didn’t expect them to give Byleth four weapons though."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel2kqh,t1_fekt0ys,1579212689.0,"Yeah which is one of the key problems. If we exclude the Echos fire emblem is left with 5 unique enough characters (Marth, Ike, Corrin, Robin and Byleth) 

But the motto of ultimate was everyone is here so cutting out some of them was not part of the plan I guess."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel2ctb,t1_fekkbbe,1579212553.0,Also Ganondorf is a sword fighter now. He has like 3 moves that include a sword.
wholesomeanimemes,fel256d,t1_fekcqkd,1579212419.0,"Yeah, the manga is the story that happens before. 

By the way the hentai came first and was so popular that pocchi made the manga."
SmashBrosUltimate,fel20pt,t1_fel1tho,1579212342.0,"You know the basic theme of persona about rebelling against society and their expectations? 

Joker is always quiet “wearing his mask” reflecting that he hides his true self behind said mask.

In battle he rips of that masks revealing his true personality (you could also say persona) 

Yeah basically that"

SmashBrosUltimate,fel11jq,t1_fek1xmd,1579211756.0,"I mean they couldn’t have added just one of the lords, each of them would upset the fans that liked the other chars (plus the people that didn’t want fire emblem in general) so this was the safest option I guess?"

Joker talks during combat because here he has his mask ripped off and is truly free.

SmashBrosUltimate,fel023o,t1_fekgsl2,1579211172.0,Same with Link from Botw. He shouts in combat and does answer questions with NPCs (with some of the answers being as sassy as those from Joker)
SmashBrosUltimate,fekzaa3,t1_fekqkcx,1579210711.0,Joker is actually very talkative in battle “showing his true colours after removing the mask” and all that
SmashBrosUltimate,fekz7h6,t1_fektple,1579210663.0,"He is talkative in battle (both smash and Persona) but in dialogue he is more of a quite guy only once in a while saying something which can be (and in my headcanon is always) very sassy. (Similar to Botw link actually) 

He only answers when asked something.

All of these things can be heavily interpreted together with the general theme of persona too."
SmashBrosUltimate,fekywdk,t1_fek116u,1579210478.0,"He does that in his game too actually. But he does not engage in actual dialogue (actually based on a reason but not important right now)

SmashBrosUltimate,feko8md,t3_epk7h4,1579204168.0,"I mean he was the most logical choice, I was even surprised so many people didn’t expect it, until I heard about that tweet that teased Dante.

In the end I understand people who are mad about it and I can’t just tell them to not have high expectations, because this time around there was a basis. 

I’m personally happy with Byleth, loved the game and his/her move set looks nice and diverse. Even more than I expected, thought they would completely center him/her around the whip sword, so this was even a nice twist."
SmashBrosUltimate,fekfuqq,t1_fek0ccf,1579199169.0,"I’m with you here. I had thought it would be Byleth from the beginning so I was pleasantly surprised.

Even more so, because his/her move set is even more diverse than I expected."
