SonyAlpha,fedyl7w,t1_fedvkdt,1579022626.0,"For most of my shots where my dog is in motion I throw on animal eye-AF, have the focus mode set to continuous, and have the focus area to wide. That said, the camera struggles with detecting my dogs eye when he’s in motion because he’s black and has darker eyes but at f/4, as long as it focuses on his face, the images come out pretty good. 

Also, make sure you have a high shutter speed set especially if you want to capture your dogs in motion. In this photo I was using a shutter speed of 1/500 as anything below that started to introduce some motion blur. 

Finally, just take as many pictures as you can. For this set of pictures I basically had my dog run at me at full speed and was shooting continuously until he ran past me. As long as the camera is able to keep focus, you should come out with some good looking pictures in the end."

SonyAlpha,fdf6jvd,t1_fdeiz2n,1578354460.0,It was taken though glass
SonyAlpha,fdf6iw8,t1_fde40k8,1578354442.0,I just posted a comment with the original!
SonyAlpha,fdf6hsm,t1_fdf5q0p,1578354422.0,"It was actually shot at 3200 ISO which was a mistake on my part because I assumed it was the same as another shot I took. 

I did edit  and crop this a little including a tiny bit of noise reduction. I posted the original photo in another comment if you’re interested!"
SonyAlpha,fdf6ag1,t3_ektx5x,1578354287.0,"Here is the original unedited shot for those interested!

SonyAlpha,fdevqow,t1_fdep7kf,1578347603.0,"I really like this lens and so far the lack of the extra stop has not prevented me from getting the shot I was looking for. That said the extra stop would be nice to help cut down noise a tiny bit in certain scenarios like this photo and it would give you a slightly faster shutter speed when doing higher speed action shots in less than ideal situations. 

With that said, for the amount I use it currently, I’m more than happy to save the money. I would personally upgrade if I could and if you can afford it, I don’t think you would regret your decision."
SonyAlpha,fde4a06,t1_fde40k8,1578330851.0,"I did do some editing, and I can post the raw image when I get home but the background looks like a watercolor because it’s a painted wall from his enclosure haha"
SonyAlpha,fdduv2g,t1_fddulhi,1578324547.0,"Focal Length: 100mm
Shutter: 1/200

Edit: I was off on these numbers originally as I thought they were the same as another shot I took."
SonyAlpha,fddtsk2,t1_fddtpbg,1578323787.0,Thank you! And this was taken at Milwaukee county zoo.
SonyAlpha,fd99g0a,t1_fd8b60r,1578230260.0,Yes
SonyAlpha,fd6isdk,t1_fcncilx,1578191675.0,This was the f/1.8
SonyAlpha,fcb233t,t1_fcb1a36,1577581232.0,I didn’t use flash on this one
SonyAlpha,fcb2236,t1_fcawu6g,1577581214.0,This lens needs quite a bit of light to get the most out of it. It does really well outdoors during the day but struggles indoors and near dusk especially with moving subjects. I think it really comes down to your use case.
SonyAlpha,fcajddg,t1_fcaj6zm,1577570307.0,It’s probably my favorite lens I have right now. It takes really great shots as long as you have enough light.
SonyAlpha,fcaijk6,t1_fcaifkp,1577569841.0,Yes it was
SonyAlpha,fc91abj,t1_fc90z3y,1577545410.0,Yeah I’ve been extremely happy with it. I upgraded from an a77 ii and this is my fourth Sony camera and it has been my favorite so far.
millionairemakers,fbkaqj7,t3_edq7ov,1576947426.0,Good luck!
