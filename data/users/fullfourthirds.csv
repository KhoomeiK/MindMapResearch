So that's probably my initial goal for now.  I just don't want to keep cutting if 4 is all there is.  The extra fat I have on my helps me fill in the gaps where I don't have any muscle lol."

You can lower the weight overall so you can spend more time under tension down there and really work on your chest having a nice stretch in that time. Also make sure your shoulder doesn't lead the movement (chest should be in front of shoulder)."

I think I only have a max of a visible 4 pack, but I just wanted to make sure.  I'm not sure if there's a reward for me to lose more weight from this picture, if I can't get more visible abs.  I tried ""Feeling for fibers"" around my belly button and I can't REALLY feel any bumps underneath what's already visible.."

photography,fdzcrhk,t1_fdzc5un,1578789023.0,Sounds good.  I have a hiking bag like that but it's a regular one.  I also have a camera backpack.  I've had to stop taking the hiking bag  because I'd have two backpacks.  So I have a camera bag backpack and a traditional carry-on rolly suitcase for my clothes.  This bag would solve my problem and I'm not even OP.  Then again I probably wouldn't want my camera in the overhead storage...

photography,fdy4nhu,t1_fdxvyks,1578776109.0,"The kit lens is variable aperture. 3.5 to 5.6. The more you zoom in the higher the aperture number goes. So when you zoom all the way in you'll be at 5.6. This let's in less light, and you'll have less background blur. The Tamron is 2.8 for the entire range. This is more light and more blur. Also separately, the Tamron lens is much better overall."
photography,fdxu4gi,t3_enccfe,1578772963.0,Skip that lens and get the Tamron 28-75. 800 is a very very good price for the Tamron. If you can get it used for cheaper than cool. But definitely the Tamron.
