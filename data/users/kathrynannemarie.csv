Instagramreality,fd3i4y7,t1_fd2njjb,1578158512.0,Shout out to my eating disorder therapist and my regular therapist. Wouldn’t say I’m fully “healed” it’s an addiction I am choosing not to indulge in at the moment; hopeful to keep it up forever.
Instagramreality,fd3hwnn,t1_fd3gke8,1578158436.0,"Your life’s purpose doesn’t need to be weight loss. Idk. I see an eating disorder therapist. Trying to lose weight while you haven’t fully understood or recovered from an ED, is just a clever way for your brain to fall back into the trap."
Instagramreality,fd2jl9n,t1_fcz6e21,1578148165.0,"Think of the stored fat as like you very last option your body will not use it first, or recklessly. In my case I ate 900 calories a day. Or I tried to and would vomit If I ate more than that. My body knew it would get food, so I didn’t use what was saved. 

Not eating can affect your cognitive functions (I crashed on the highway because I passed out at the wheel). As well as your liver. My muscles hurt so bad at one point I couldn’t get out of bed. I was suffering from malnutrition. My heart rate was very erratic and my body temperature to this day is fucked. And honestly, the misery of existing with the intrusive thoughts is enough to make me want to kill myself. Eating shouldn’t be hard; I get extreme anxiety when I have to do it. 

It’s hard to know every effect of atypical anorexia because treatment isn’t usually sought, not acknowledged. Most gain weight back. Usually long term effects are chalked up to obesity, when it’s usually yo-yo dieting and sever restriction that hurts someone.

Instagramreality,fczkbt3,t1_fcyzl61,1578103114.0,"It absolutely does. I don’t look like I had an eating disorder. But fuck me, my heart is irregular.
And my body temperature. My liver isn’t the strongest. I worry a lot about permanent damage to my brain. My doctors say I’ll be okay though; that it’s not ruining my cognitive ability. 

If I don’t eat I get the shakes. Sometimes it’s hard to focus.

I eat regularly now. And don’t exercise for hours at a time anymore. I’m getting help. But fuck my brain loves being disordered. And that’s the worst part. Thinking it can solve my problems."
Instagramreality,fczjo5o,t1_fcyz7ij,1578102705.0,"Well I passed out at the wheel because I hadn’t  eaten in 4 days. Almost killed myself and others. Cognitive function goes very quickly.


Aside from many other health complications. Malnourishment is still possible. It takes a lot for your body to start “burning” the fat you already have.  Your body will do anything to keep you
alive - so slowly using that stored energy to keep you alive longer; it isn’t a go to option to burn through quickly. You’re more likely to binge when you finally get food than to burn through the saved energy.

Studies show yo-yo dieting can lead to diabetes as well as any other diseases"
