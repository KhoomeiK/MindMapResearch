news,fed0srr,t1_fecq5nz,1578992964.0,"You're talking about the Laffer Curve. That was almost 50 years ago, economists have thoroughly debunked it's popular interpretation.

From the wiki article;

""In 2005, the United States [Congressional Budget Office](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office) (CBO) released a paper called ""Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates."" 

This paper considered the impact of a reduction of 10% in the then existing marginal rate of [federal income tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States) in the US (for example, if those facing a 25% marginal federal income tax rate had it lowered to 22.5%).

 Unlike earlier research, the CBO paper estimates the budgetary impact of possible [macroeconomic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics) effects of tax policies, that is, it attempts to account for how reductions in individual income tax rates might affect the overall future growth of the economy, and therefore influence future government tax revenues; and ultimately, impact deficits or surpluses. 

In the paper's most generous estimated growth scenario, only 28% of the projected lost revenue from the lower tax rate would be recouped over a 10-year period after a 10% across-the-board reduction in all individual income tax rates. In other words, deficits would increase by nearly the same amount as the tax cut in the first five years, with limited feedback revenue thereafter.

 Through increased budget deficits, the tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy will be paid for—plus interest—by [taxes borne relatively evenly by all taxpayers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_States).[[27]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve#cite_note-27) 

The paper points out that these projected shortfalls in revenue would have to be made up by federal borrowing: the paper estimates that the federal government would pay an extra US$200 [billion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) in interest over the decade covered by the paper's analysis."""

Most heavy cocaine users aren't really aware of the risks. Send her this (I did not write it) :

Cocaine every weekend is considered heavy use (more than 50x a year = heavy use), which is about 20% of cocaine users, and also similar to the amount of people who would be classified as having cocaine use disorder (addiction).

About 80% of the time it's taken it's going to be tainted with levamisole, which functions like meth. 10-20% of time it will actually have meth (depending on where you live the number could be slightly higher or lower), I've seen it tainted with PCP when I've seen hospital bloodwork, but that might have been contained to the northeastern seaboard of the US.

You're 20x more likely to die of a stroke while high on cocaine, and if you're using alcohol too (like most people do when using cocaine) that number is 100x. For the next week after using (so all the time for you) you're 10x more likely to die of a stroke.

If it's cut with metoprolol (a beta-blocking cardiac drug) your chances of having coronary vasospasm are much higher than with cocaine alone. About 5-10% of cocaine is cut with metoprolol.

If it's cut with diltiazem (actually heart protective while on cocaine, unlike metoprolol) and you have a cardiac abnormality like wolf-parkinson-white syndrome, your first line might kill you. About 5-10% of cocaine is cut with diltiazem (slightly higher than metoprolol).

Nasal septal perforation happens to everybody, cocaine is a profound vasoconstrictor too. You'll eventually end up with [akathisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akathisia), increased impulsivity, permanent derangement of your opioid receptors, permanent derangement of your D2/D3 dopamine receptors, worse gambling performance, worse delayed gratification. You'll basically never be able to feel as happy as you did while you were on cocaine for the rest of your life. Some of these cognitive deficits disappear after about 2 years of discontinuing, most of them disappear after 8+ years of abstinence, but some of them have been shown to be present even after 10+ years of quitting. Some of these changes have probably already happened to ""your friend"" and are irreversible, if you're asking this question now.

Increased predilection for high risk behaviours, this mostly goes away after years of abstinence, but it persist to some degree. Cocaine users are much more likely than the average person to have transmissible diseases. That's why cocaine use + blood donations don't mix. Plus with the average purity of cocaine being about 40% in the US (closer to 60% in border towns by Texas) you have no idea what other drugs you're ingesting too (definitely levamisole, maybe cetirizine, diltiazem, metoprolol, probably caffeine and ephedrine), and that could contaminate blood.

Alcoholism/cocaine use are heavily tied. While 3/100 men in the US will use cocaine in their life, and 1/100 women (women are much more likely to become addicted, though, and to use larger quantities if they are addicted), a heavy drinker (9+ drinks/week in women, 15+ drinks/week in men) is 20x more likely than the average person to have tried cocaine. 80% of men with cocaine abuse tendencies (your friend definitely fits this with weekly use, recreational is considered once a month or less) are alcoholics or end up turning to alcohol after cessation of cocaine use, and this is true in about 40% of women abusers. This is because both hit the opioid receptors, and cocaine causes permanent derangement.

With alcohol a lot of the problems (before you end up developing cirrhosis) are mostly reversible, though. But with concurrent use of both, by the time most people realize they have a cocaine problem and stop, and then years later they realize they have a drinking problem too, at least some permanent damage is done from the alcohol too. This is particularly true in women who's bodies deteriorate more quickly than mens (telescoping effect, usually they start later or are less likely to ever use the drugs, but of those that do it affects them much more quickly than men in terms of long term health effects).

If you're sharing bills/straws you will end up getting whatever infection someone has eventually (cocaine use is a little known source of Hep C infection, it's not nearly as common as from heroin/injecting drugs even like cocaine, but snorting coke is a risk factor too).

Cocaine induced ischemia in the hands/feet/bowels (cocaine ischemia can affect the stomach), permanent cardiac/brain damage. I've seen multiple small infarcts/brain stem lesions on people's imaging scans (they were pointed out to me by the radiologists) on even recreational cocaine users (10-15x a year for a decade) in their 20s 30s. You give yourself mini-strokes all the time with cocaine. Haven't seen focal band necrosis on the heart (you scar your heart and it dies, but it's only small ilttle bits and pieces of it) but that's because I never took a pathology elective, apparently it's a very common finding in even young regular (50x+/year) cocaine abusers.

Cocaine + alcohol = cocaethylene which is more toxic to the heart and liver than either alone. I think the effects in literature might have been overstated, but it's definitely true that it's more harmful, just probably not 5x more harmful or whatever. Additive with some synergistic effect.

MUCH higher risk of suicide. Basically using cocaine is like inducing the mania component of bipolar disorder, except it's much worse on your body (because of the tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and hypertension induced by cocaine), so when you come down you wanna kill yourself.

Every year of cocaine abuse ages your brain at double the rate of average. So at once a week use for 10 years, (lets say between 20-30) your brain age will end up being 40, but you won't be less intelligent or anything because of it, just slower at processing things. It causes permanent changes in short term memory and brain atrophy (gray matter) that's irreversible too, and not entirely similar to normal aging, but the ""normal aging"" part of brain development doubles too, is what I'm saying.

The average age of death of a cocaine addict is high 40s to low 50s (I think the number is pegged at 48, but I dunno how accurate that is). The only time I saw a cocaine users in their 60s at work was when they started doing it in their 40s or 50s. I've seen quite a few in their 40s who were going to be dead in a few years, though. Women addicts typically die quicker than men."

geopolitics,fe6ic35,t1_fe6c5ub,1578891811.0,"Awesome points.

Just to expand on 3, I recently read a book about the fall of the USSR called The Last Empire by Sergii Polkhy.

His argument was that 3 was the primary issue, especially between Russia and Ukraine. The USSR was actually prepared to let the Baltics and some central Asian states go but losing Ukraine was unfathomable.

 Only 55% of the USSR was Russian, and the RSSR dominated USSR politics.

It's actually pretty amazing that it lasted so long- the USSR was fundamentally a colonial empire."
news,fe6hptn,t1_fe6gdoe,1578891249.0,"Awesome! I agree, this is a great convo. As far as my own opinions go I am a geopolitical realist- ie I believe states act to protect their interests and that bringing morality into the picture complicates things.

For example, Iran. I feel if the US and Iran swapped positions, the US would do the same as Iran and Iran would do the same as the US. It makes sense the US would engage in conflicts halfway around the world to maintain its hegemonic status, and it makes sense Iran would engage in assymetic warfare. Because what else do they have to work with?

I feel it's less about people and belief systems and more so about geography, history and economics. Russia is belligerent because their western border is on the Eurasian plane. The US is so successful thanks to access to 2 oceans and is isolated. Iran is engaged in ""terrorism"" because they have been under siege for 50 years, etc

politics,fe6g5ye,t1_fe6bvlf,1578889901.0,"I'm confused about this too. The [Turnaway study](https://www.ansirh.org/research/turnaway-study) which the article is based on says 95% of sampled women did not feel regret after five years. 

The Turnaway study had n=8000 but Salon only selected n=677 to form their data set. 

It does say they experienced a range of emotions in the weeks following the procedure including relief and regret, but after 5 years the incidence was no higher than with women who had not had an abortion and that there was no difference between women who aborted during different trimesters.

Since a significant portion of women are pro life, I think the takeaway here is that having an abortion can make pro life women pro choice."
politics,fe6eoem,t3_ennzq1,1578888664.0,"Can we stop using job numbers as a barometer of economic health?

Employment is a lagging indicator- if there is a recession, then there is worsening job numbers. Not the other way around.

A better metric would be leading indicators, like data in the ISM Manufacturing Index, m2, CPI, the stock market or new housing construction"
news,fe6e2ol,t1_fe5lu93,1578888180.0,"I agree with a lot of this, and you are correct on many things. Let me get this out of the way- there is no universal definition of terrorism, and we seem to be working with different ones.

Many people require that for someone to be a terrorist, they have to be a non state actor. Otherwise it becomes easy to argue many countries engage in terrorism. The US, the USSR, the UK, Russia, Iran, Israel and pretty much any other ""powerful"" countries have engaged in some sort of proxy war, regime change or asymmetric warfare.

I would agree that the UN is often ineffective, but that is sort of the point. The Security Council was built to take minimal action and lend legitimacy to it's decisions. If NATO countries agree on something, that's not very surprising as they have similar interests. If Russia, China and the rest of the council agree, it makes a very strong case for action.

Coalition building is great, but it doesn't determine legality. The Warsaw Pact was a similar treaty, and the Prauge Spring was legal under it, and the USSR and other aligned counties took action and invaded.

Which is why I default to international law. There's another case for it as well. In the Constitution, treaties are regarded as law that can only be superseded by the Constitution itself. Since the US signed the UN Charter, not only is international law international, it is US law as well."
news,fe07ssf,t1_fe02kxs,1578805357.0,"Ok! Great response, I don't agree but I appricate the time you put into it. I'll try and do the same.

First off let me clarify- I am strictly speaking about international law. In China, the detention of religious minorities is perfectly legal, but I think you'd agree that's something that is overall illegal. Remember Iran has designated the US armed forces as terrorists, that doesn't mean assassinating the president would be legal.

The US was decidedly not invited to Iraq. Saddam Hussein and the Baath party were the leaders of Iraq and they had a UN seat. They did not invite us, the invasion was decidedly illegal. Under the UN charter, the only 2 situations that can be met with force are self defence, and collective action.

This is voted on by the security council. France, Russia and China vetoed it so it was without a doubt illegal. What's interesting is how the US argued it's case for self defence- the assassination attempt on George HW Bush, ten years prior was the justification.

Suleimani was designated a terrorist by the US. The UN sanctioned him, but that doesn't mean assassination was legal.
