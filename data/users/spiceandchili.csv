NobodyAsked,ffguf23,t1_ffgm10v,1579915328.0,My heart absolutely breaks for you and I am so sorry for the pain you have endured. Thank you so much for sharing your story and hang in there.
NobodyAsked,ffg3dr8,t1_fffxlh5,1579897588.0,"I was in therapy 3 times a week while pregnant. Had I not been, the cycle of abuse would’ve continued for sure. I’m sorry for making you cry."
NobodyAsked,fffoo0n,t3_et71k8,1579888466.0,"Story time! I used to get the hell beaten out of me by my family and neighbors because that’s just how things used to get done. As an adult, I now suffer from BPD, complex PTSD and Pure Obsessional OCD. 

See, when your parents ok for other people to hit you, those people will hit you. Why?! Because people don’t view the child as having any value. If the parent doesn’t value the child, the world will have a crack at him/her. That child is not viewed as a human with feelings. 

I was severely beaten by a teacher from year 1 to year 4. She would make me stand in front of the class while slapping me across the face. My peers laughed and in return they would bully me. 
My aunt would hit me for not listening. My neighbors would also hit me. My grandma broke an old belt on me. 

I am a mother to an almost 6 year old. Today he broke a plate. It was an imported plate and the set is now incomplete. Had it been me doing that, I would’ve been hollared at, belittled and beaten the shit out of. My son was too worried about his foot hurting. I went and kissed it, then cleaned up the plate. Am I pissed about the plate?! Yes! But my child feels safe and doesn’t fear me. When he looks to me, he thinks: mom protects me and makes me feel better. 
When I looked at my mother as a child, I thought: I hate this woman. She hurts me and I wish she died. 

My mother and I have not spoken in over 6 years. She never met my son and she never will. My grandma will die never knowing what’s happened to me. I live in England and my mom has no idea. 

Never beat your children. It’s the lazy way to parent. It’s not funny to hit them. Yes, they’re annoying. Yes, they drive you insane, but YOU made the choice to have them. Nobody told you to pop out kids you can’t parent."
relationships,ffemwsl,t3_et15a1,1579855065.0,"I’m not necessarily mad at the 19 year old because she’s a teen. In her mind, OP’s husband is probably just an old guy who’s helping with her major. 

OP’s husband however may not have cheated now, but eventually his ass will. I have seen my fair share of crappy men and the red flags in his behavior are everywhere. His grown, married ass is going over to the neighbor’s house weekly and spending hours “helping” this 19 year old with her schoolwork. If this 19 year old was a dude, or not good looking, do we really think his ass would be there?! 
He’s also going to exhibits behind his wife’s back. I’m sorry..... but if I found out my husband was taking the neighbor’s perky 19 year old daughter out behind my back, yeah, there would be a problem. 

Where there is smoke, there’s fire. Had this young girl came on to this man, I highly doubt his as would’ve been like: Oh no! This is inappropriate. I don’t think my wife, who doesn’t even know about our little extracurricular meetings, would like this. 

Eventually his ass will cheat. Mark my words."

CasualUK,ff6c0hx,t3_errr7f,1579623890.0,Not a good idea. The windshield can crack.
InsanePeopleQuora,ff5k7t9,t3_erns6p,1579596824.0,"My mother has been trying to kick me out since I was like 15. I left at 18 and never came back. I am 30 now and we don’t have much of a relationship. In fact, I haven’t spoken to her in 6 years and she’s never met her 5 year old grandchild. I’ve also relocated to another continent and she has no idea. 
Hope her treatment of me was worth it.
I’m her only only child by the way."
fatpeoplestories,ff5jz5a,t3_erh0fl,1579596477.0,Hell nah! Stand your ground. Fat people are so fucking rude and jealous of literally everyone. Their self esteem is as strong as the people enabling their behavior.
entitledparents,ff5jnjc,t3_erhx1e,1579596019.0,You really gotta wonder what in the fuck is wrong with people like this. How can somebody go out in public and be so unhinged?!
relationships,ff5jij0,t3_erisrs,1579595820.0,Your wife will be the JustNoMom in a few years.
BPD,ff5j3yn,t3_erfsk6,1579595254.0,"As a child, yes and because of this, I’ve learned to always make sure people choose me. When they don’t, it’s definitely triggering."
WatchPeopleDieInside,fexaw0a,t1_fewm287,1579427882.0,Me too. Omg! Then I would immediately fall because anytime I try to run I twist my ankle.

CasualConversation,fenlvh2,t1_fen6ikr,1579287469.0,"I know it’s dumb, but I get early anxious and I noticed myself checking likes and needing that validation. I found it unhealthy."
CasualConversation,fenls8j,t1_fen8er1,1579287415.0,Same here
CasualConversation,fenlr4i,t1_fenjwxt,1579287396.0,This is a little different IMO. I don’t post everyday and check for likes like I did with IG and Facebook.
BPD,femkaqd,t3_epldwt,1579259865.0,This condition is so baffling and sometimes I wouldn’t have it any other way.
