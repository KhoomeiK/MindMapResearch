BlackPeopleTwitter,feu6xv7,t1_feu6s0j,1579383736.0,Yeah but he'll always live on...for following that damn train with Big Smoke's big ass also riding on the motorcycle
BlackPeopleTwitter,feu521o,t1_feu44qy,1579383181.0,"I mainly count San Andreas as his main area then the badlands, san fierro, etc. Then again, I played the game when I was like 14 so it's been almost 15 years. I didn't pay too much attention to location names, just what the places looked like."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feu22wx,t1_feu1lsc,1579382370.0,"Yeah but who knows what all happened with that when it comes to GTA 5, especially when you consider the online where everyone can start their own casino. No idea what happened to Madd Dogg, etc. He probably didn't leave California but he's not in San Andreas"
BlackPeopleTwitter,ferp3e0,t1_ferp135,1579356727.0,I wonder if CJ went back to LC
BlackPeopleTwitter,fermnbf,t3_eqgmki,1579355842.0,The first beef I remember!  I'm with grove street all the way though I hated seeing how it looked in GTA 5
BlackPeopleTwitter,feg7ke3,t1_feg0j5h,1579080768.0,I guess they decided that life fucks with them too much so they dont even have time to fuck with themselves
FTMFitness,fe1yt8m,t3_enkcca,1578832466.0,Im not sure what the pyramid is but congrats on the gains and sobriety
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdx4vqf,t1_fdx3x54,1578765383.0,"Yeah I saw a post where they compared how the media treated her vs how they treated Kate when it came to them holding their baby bumps. With Megan, they were like ""Is she insecure? Why does she keep touching her baby bump?"" but then with Kate, they said ""Look at Kate bonding with the baby!"".

ProperAnimalNames,fdu6hti,t3_emukqz,1578728442.0,It's like the Harry Potter sorting hat and Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas had a fat baby
masterhacker,fdu6alr,t1_fdrnv8s,1578728331.0,Probably just a case of overcomplicating it though it wouldn't surprise me if this guy made a few wrong clicks and ended up wiring money to a Nigerian prince somehow
mildlyinfuriating,fdshj2g,t1_fdshgyg,1578702863.0,That's actually really cool. Thanks for letting me know
mildlyinfuriating,fdsftgl,t1_fdsfp7r,1578701804.0,What kind of video is that? Never heard of it

todayilearned,fcxhwgg,t1_fcxhh9r,1578063342.0,"Yeah, the comments are pretty jumbled so I see how that could happen"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcxfsdh,t1_fcxfd8g,1578061794.0,True true
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcxf6a2,t1_fcwr6qv,1578061329.0,...Did they have a conniption because they didn't understand retweeting?
InsanePeopleQuora,fcx2531,t1_fcwt9h2,1578047865.0,Yeah I'll never understand why they thought that was a good idea when they actually wanted people to use the site to ask genuine questions
todayilearned,fcx1rkv,t1_fcwtc6c,1578047377.0,I know a person who does it and he told me it helps him stay in the moment and on track since his mind likes to wonder and focus on other things.
todayilearned,fcx1mxz,t1_fcwxxtz,1578047214.0,"Because it doesn't always predict the best option. I sometimes have to scroll over or use the checkmark function so it'll stop assuming it knows what I'm going to say. Hell, even with the word assuming, I had to scroll over 4 words before it gave me the right tense.

Just like if I capitalized a word one time, it decides that the word will always be capitalized."
todayilearned,fcw8pdk,t1_fcw8gv1,1578019706.0,It definitely is. My brain has betrayed me twice today.
todayilearned,fcw6zfp,t1_fcw6jea,1578018583.0,"Thanks! I think I partially did it in case someone didn't show up (I had a few bad experiences with school groups so fool me once and all that). That being said, I should talk to some actor acquaintances and see what their process is when it comes to line memorization."
todayilearned,fcw5r16,t1_fcw5d8p,1578017787.0,"It's not that I'm stupid. My phone predicted ""could care less"" and I didn't fix it since I had to rewrite what I wrote since the app kept crashing"
todayilearned,fcw3mt6,t1_fcw3ftn,1578016383.0,That's 100% true! Not sure how I managed to forget the word amateur
todayilearned,fcvyqvc,t1_fcvxwsa,1578013157.0,"I could care less about them mouthing the lines when it's one of their first roles. If they can remember multiple script pages at a time, make their character believable and enjoyable and the only drawback is having to mouth lines to concentrate, I see that as an absolute win. That's why I love seeing how far she and Will Smith have come."
todayilearned,fcvxoru,t1_fcvxcit,1578012462.0,"I don't think it's shitty when it's their first role and in her case, she was 9. Back when I had to do group presentations, we had to submit a ""script"" so the teacher knew we didn't deviate and ramble and I memorized what everyone said just because it was easier to know what would come  before and after my part."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcmu0lv,t1_fcmpmvf,1577792218.0,"Exactly! I mainly wore mine on my right but then I switched it to my left when I messed up my wrist. Now, I wear it on whichever side feels best on that day. Why would someone even care about that?"

technicallythetruth,fc8guzi,t1_fc8ac2r,1577534615.0,"You are 100% correct! I still remember the first time I heard the song, I paused the game and listened to it on YouTube so I wouldn't mess up my first listening experience. Had to hear the bars"
