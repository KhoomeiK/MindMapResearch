AskReddit,ffp9l99,t3_eu6sfl,1580089580.0,"Epstein **did** kill himself. 

Systematic incompetence throughout the prison system allowed it to happen. He was a smart guy. Smarter than the guards. Smarter than the designer of his cell. He was determined. He worked with his lawyer and displayed the right actions/attitudes to get off suicide watch. He made a rope out of cloth, wetted it, wrapped it around his neck and threw himself off the top bunk so that his neck would break. 

Reddit assumes that everyone is a news junkie and knows who epstein was and why his capture was such a big deal. Not a good assumption. The guards may have been told but probably didn't give a shit just like the rest of their job. 

The recordings and malfunctioning cameras? Shit breaks all the time you think prisons have a good maintenance budget? YOU need to prove these discrepancies were anomalous, because shit being broke is the normal state of things. ESPECIALLY for video records - those things that virtually never get looked at."
