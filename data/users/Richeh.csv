AskReddit,ffpn95f,t3_euawng,1580099344.0,"Met a woman online.  We exchanged messages, eventually realized that we'd like to meet up, but couldn't for about a month.

We kept messaging though, and talked about life stuff; she was going through some work stuff, and I guess we got sort of intimate - nothing frisky, just relating to each other.

Anyway, one weekend I was visiting my parents so I got out of the habit of messaging for a couple of days.  I send her a ""How are you"" and get a ""Fine if you care"" followed by ""If you think it's okay to not message me for a week then maybe this isn't a good idea.""

This, if I'm honest, put me on guard.  We'd been messaging for a little over a week before that, and I'd been busy and suddenly I was in trouble?  For what?  I said ""Well, I didn't think I'd done anything wrong, but if you think I did then maybe you're right, this isn't a good idea, I don't want to hurt you with negligence"".  Or words to that effect with the same tone.  I certainly didn't apologise; apart from anything else, if she wanted to talk, she could have messaged me.

Anyway, I won't bore you with the following conversation but as soon as I said okay, bad idea, we shouldn't do this, she jacknifed a hundred and eighty degrees into why we shouldn't call it off.  I admit, there's other possible reasons for her behaviour, but right or wrong what I concluded from it was a) she was trying to get me on the back foot before we'd even met, or b) it was all about the drama.

After that, I just couldn't muster the enthusiasm to risk it.  I mean, if someone's going to be playing games to get me to apologise for things for the upper hand then I have to be conscious about what I apologise for and I'm British and OH JESUS CHRIST I'M TIRED ALREADY."

ukpolitics,ffi3fgo,t1_ffhzob5,1579963951.0,"It's not the lack of labour that's the problem.  It's the lack of agency.

While people are required to do work, there's a balance of power between the 1% and the 99%; while the 1% have authority, there is a point at which they can't hold it against the 99%; there's a limit to what they can demand, even from a fortified ivory tower they still need people to run the infrastructure.  

They don't farm, so they need farmers for food.  They don't design or manufacture, so they need factories to make goods.  They need commerce to support the production.  They need police to maintain order throughout.

Now, the police maintain the order the 1% impose - if they decide public urination's illegal, the police will arrest people who do it.  But if they say, for example, homosexuality is illegal then maybe the police will do it in general, but there'll be pushback.  If the police are individuals, they have agency.  They might not enforce that law so harshly.

So what if we use heuristic algorithms to analyse every police officer's arrest record?  If we monitor them constantly - a huge cost in man hours, but if we, again, plug voice pattern analysis and behavioural data of the entire force into a heuristic algorithm perhaps we can detect how officers act when they're disregarding a crime.  Fuck it, let's plug that data into a swarm of drones armed with cyanide dartguns.  People behave better when they're terrified.

*What happens* when these 1% of people have complete, unquestioning control of production, of policing, and there is 99% of people doing nothing, who own very little, with their hands out?

I think some small agencies actually run off this bullshit, making payroll because they take advantage of industry newbies.

Look at it this way:  you had two other opportunities, and that's because you're good.  January does usually pick up a bit from December because nobody hires people on the run-up to Christmas - but this year it's been quiet, according to recruiters I know.  It'll pick up.

Also, requirements are a wishlist, and it's one that's very often not met; and recruiters often don't know what they're talking about beyond the three-letter-acronym so when they demand that it's very important that you have ""experience with OWNCAR packages"" and you've never heard of ""Owncar"" before, it's generally just that they haven't realized that you need your own car to get to the office and they're bluffing it out harder than you are.

sheffield,fefa9r4,t1_feeqzkz,1579051862.0,"Well, I do agree that ""taking offence"" certainly should grant you no guarantees of restitution.  But I've heard very, very few people declare that they're taking offence, it's usually used in the context of either people saying other people would be offended by something, or by people complaining about people ""being offended"", IE, Mr. Fry's point.  Take my own post for example!  I'm not Romani, or black, and yet I've declared those things terrible - albeit in the politest terms I could muster.

I think that could mean two things, probably both: that people like taking offence on behalf of other people because it gives them the moral high ground on both consideration and altruism at the same time - and therefore automatic public support; and it could also mean that people who *do* find these things offensive are kind of socially intimidated into not making the point for themselves.  I mean, it's very British to not want to make a fuss.

Which is an interesting position, because I absolutely want people not to be intimidated and if I say something that makes them feel personally belittled or slighted then I'd like them to let me know so I can make it clear that it's not my intention; when I *actually* want to belittle or slight someone, I'm pretty overt about it because I feel that's the adult way to deal with things.

Personally I'd no idea the word had those connotations until someone of Romani descent pulled me up on it and suggested I maybe should curb my usage a bit, which is fair enough.

I say that because I do wonder if this is the way to go about it.  It sounds potentially a little heavy-handed.  ""Microaggressions"" (I hate that term) are often the result of mild ignorance or social clumsiness.  These aren't people who think of themselves as racists, and are likely thoroughly decent people who are naive to certain tropes, implications and contexts in the language they use - and we all pick up linguistic artifacts from our surroundings. Often we do it without thorough analysis.  

The words ""tinker"" and ""gypsy"", and the golliwog doll, are all pretty appalling to modern thinking but once they were once used widely.  Then someone pointed out ""hey, this is pretty shitty actually"" and people were like ""oh fuck, yeah, I didn't think of that"".  And they stopped using them.  The crime here isn't active oppression, it's the cumulative effect of lots of people not thinking.  And who the fuck isn't guilty of that?

From the perspective of people who fall foul of it, this could well appear to be a paid brigade of liberal know-it-alls.  Is that really the image that you want to put on the simple act of not being a prick to people?

This gives the accused the subconscious choice:

  * They're right - I'm in the wrong and I have to mentally group myself a little with racists, people I've always looked down on.  This shifts my worldview.  I have to expend effort in keeping myself up to date with the latest microaggressions so I don't let one slip; and this makes me wonder how many people accused of racism are just like myself, centrists who've made a simple mistake.

  * I'm right - they're petty arseholes.  What I said doesn't matter.  Everyone says it.  Who are they to accuse me?  Liberalism is overreaching now.  I'm going to buy tickets to Al Murray's Pub Landlord gig and cheer unironically at him mocking foreigners.

And of the two the path of least resistance is the second.

I don't know.  I could be wrong about this, I often am.  But it pains me to see liberalism used as bragging rights or a stick with which to beat people, rather than an invitation down a path to self betterment and, y'know, more friends.

I'd like to see accidental blunders reduced, and god knows I'd like to see passive aggressive racist needling stamped out completely.

CatsAreAssholes,fdkb956,t1_fdkagoz,1578500215.0,"No, I realize that you can address their mental stimulation; but it still seems more like captivity than domestication to me when you *can* let them out and they'll happily mooch around, come back again, and have a safe base to hide in, and have an entire neighbourhood of cats to socialize with - or not, at their discretion."
CatsAreAssholes,fdk8r01,t1_fdjyy26,1578498643.0,"Personally I've heard this argument before and I take it with a pinch of salt.

Humans have an absolutely terrible track record when it comes to interfering with native populations.  We brought Asian Carp to America as food.  We brought the poisonous Cane Toad to Australia to control crop pests and now they're killing *everything*.

And you can say sure, that includes domesticated cats.  But the problem with maintaining ecosystems is a) are you sure you understand the ecosystem, because they're really complicated and b) are you sure you're not just going to do more damage.  For example, what *else* are the cats killing?  Would you rather have cats, or an explosion of rats?  And then fleas, riding the rats?

I realize that the argument ""we shouldn't try to ameliorate our own effects on the environment"" is a bad one, and it's not what I mean.  Ecosystems are constantly in flux, but it's our overt attempts to control them that have consistently had the most disastrous effects.  As a species we have a really, really hard time not trying to control things; mostly what we do is destroy the subtleties of them."
CatsAreAssholes,fdk7mqv,t1_fdjviys,1578497928.0,"In the UK, it's the norm.  And I'm for it.  Cats are intelligent creatures and it seems unkind to me to keep them stuck in a half-dozen rooms their entire life.
  
In my own experience, if kept inside cats often go a bit... crazy; and my own cat - left free to roam inside and out - lived a happy life until the day he died at the ripe old age of twenty which I think illustrates that it can be perfectly safe.  We had to keep him indoors for a while because he hurt his leg and he went *fucking.  insane.*

I will say that it's an odd argument in that both inside-cat people and outside-cat people both claim the moral high ground.  Myself, I can see that if the area's unsafe then it can be for the best to keep them in.  But I can't help but wonder if some inside-cat-owners (SOME) just like that it keeps their cat like a dependent child."

Big words are easily spoken in praise of culture, but words are cheap (I suppose that's more or less my point).  But culture is in people, not in things.  If everyone dropped dead tomorrow, how much ""culture"" is in books that nobody can read, or in art that nobody can contextualize?

I realize that the death of *everyone* is a different concept to sacrificing *some* people, but is it to the people who are dead?  Schindler's list has a saying (I believe the Jewish people had it first but let's be honest, I only know it from Schindler's list) - ""He who saves one life saves the world entire"".  What does that say about a person who ends a life?  For the victim, it costs everything; culture and all.  Bit much to ask of other people in my opinion."

The idea that you've got something ""forever"" is a scary one, especially in your early twenties.  Don't worry though!  An estimated 20% of the population over 12 years old have the HS virus - admittedly many don't know it.  I don't think it's exactly something you need to ""come out"" to your parents over, it's just one of those conditions that you're going to accrue as  you get older - like a trick knee or an ear that won't pop.

That said, you should be responsible with it; use protection, which tbh is a good idea anyway, and be honest with your partners.  Some may be concerned by it, but you've got something more than a 20% chance of them saying ""Oh, thank god, me too""; that's weighted because it's more common amongst women, and it's going to get higher as your dating pool gets older.  And for the record, that talk goes along the lines of ""I really like you so I want to be honest; I have herpes that I caught from an ex-girlfriend.  This is Graham, he is my prophylactic, he will be joining us for the evening if you're okay with this.""  You might want to edit it for your own voice.

Also a side note, early outbreaks of HSV are by far the worst; your body gradually learns to deal with it better.  If you're going through those early outbreaks, bear in mind that you're seeing the worst of the condition.  One foot in front of the other, old chap.  You're going to be fine."
