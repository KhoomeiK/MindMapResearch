The ability to form your thoughts in a timely manner and under a degree of pressure is part of the second example above, as well as two of the many metrics that the exam is trying to gauge. It's not perfect, but it does give them a glimpse of this part of your ability.




That's the rational part of the argument for timed exams. The practical part is they don't have the time or faculty to be watching y'all all day. Tests serve a different purpose than essays or homework. This doesn't give a perfect view of everyone and disproportionately disadvantages some people more than others, but it is our current best model for evaluating students at this phase of life where there is very little in the way of experience or achievements to evaluate.




I'm sorry to hear about your first choice university, but if you are in the US this might be a blessing in disguise. It sometimes pays to chart a course before you set sail. I'd browse r/personalfinance r/mealprepsunday and r/financialindependence as all three of the above were a tremendous help to me in getting started on the right foot. If I had it to do over again, I'd do 1-2 years at a community or city college before going to a state school and getting a degree I actually **know** I want. Which is something very different from what I *thought* I wanted at 18. Good luck with everything hermano, I know you've got this."

And is it damaging by depressing consumption in the people that hold the debt? Or some other mechanism that is detrimental to the economy? It can't be a bubble that burst like the mortgage debt crisis because it can't be defaulted on, so it's insulated from the economy in that way. Unless there's more of a direct impact than depressed consumption I probably wouldn't call it a crisis like the others you mentioned because they all had a precipice the people or entities involved were able to fall over."

It does cost us money to forgive that debt. They walk away with their degree, no debt, and the same spread out tax burden we all have to now deal with. They are enriching themselves to the detriment of their fellow citizens."

Additionally, we are not developed to the point where it is best if everyone has an education, there are many white collar jobs that will be automated away before a large number of trades and blue collar jobs that involve environments anathema to cost effective machine operation. Additionally, there are two areas where I feel the money could be better spent from two separate perspectives that I often.

1. Pragmatically, investing in infrastructure would have a better return for the economy and in turn make it easier for these individuals to pay off their debt. Or,


2. Morally, medical debt should be forgiven before student loans because it is inherently **much** less of a voluntary transaction."
