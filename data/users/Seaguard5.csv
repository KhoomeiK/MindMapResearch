Bumble,felahtr,t1_fela5si,1579217633.0,Worse than that she said she would love it! But taking days to respond says otherwise...
gaming,felaet6,t1_fela5et,1579217580.0,I would say it is a much better rule than shorter time makes games better...
HaloWars,felabez,t1_fel9x6v,1579217519.0,"Right, yeah that’s good."
gaming,fel9s4s,t3_eppjif,1579217177.0,"Yeah, guys don’t get mad at delays you should rejoice instead. I’m surprised so many people don’t know that more time spent on a game makes it better as a general rule."
Bumble,fel9htb,t3_epqpm9,1579216993.0,Yeah that’s fucked up. How would anyone thing that would be a good thing?
CasualConversation,fel99rw,t1_fel7p8c,1579216849.0,Oh thanks. You know me (actually you don’t) lol
HaloWars,fel983a,t1_fel7acl,1579216819.0,What’s wrong with having a veteran help you? Can learn a lot that way that you can’t from reading guides
pokemoncardcollectors,fel6pbf,t1_fel6lz7,1579215229.0,I am old haha! But yeah I think that’s pretty new relative to the life of the card game as a whole.
TooAfraidToAsk,fel6idf,t3_eph6o6,1579215109.0,Actually the opposite for me- I’m archiving videos from all the channels I’m subbed to and I’m going through them so far I have only unsubbed one or two out of like 20

relationship_advice,fel5j5g,t3_epmfcw,1579214511.0,Ask him if he shares your thought (chances are he doesn’t) and hopfully you can take peace of mind in his response and trust him. All relationships rely on trust and trusting him (like I assume he trusts you) is huge.
worldnews,fel5cq3,t3_epnloc,1579214402.0,What research and how? What is the metric here?
NoStupidQuestions,fel5816,t1_fel51xl,1579214323.0,I see. Well thanks!

“Fixing” anyone is never a healthy mentality to have. It just sets you up for disappointment"

unpopularopinion,fel4evd,t1_fel3vf5,1579213824.0,"Like, the whole industry is run more by ads than the sport now...

The sport alone makes more money than they know what to do (well) with anyway. They are so greedy it isn’t even funny."

unpopularopinion,fel3tje,t3_epi9j1,1579213461.0,I think the stricter the religion the stronger that feeling is because why the fuck would god birth us into this life with so many options that are cool and good and restrict you to so many rules that it really seems like the institution is really a control mechanism created wholly by people.

Tinder,fel26gc,t1_fel1q1e,1579212442.0,"If it truly is better. And yeah, maybe it’s just the people who use it and their mentality then as opposed to the medium. But you can’t deny the medium promotes vanity over substance."
relationship_advice,fel226i,t1_fel1ddq,1579212367.0,"Honestly, I wasn’t the best with people because I hated people for how they’ve treated me. I have had the worst luck with people in the past and known nothing but hate. Some good people were around a while ago but I probably scared them off with kind of how I was (just not trusting, ETC). I wasn’t psycho or anything though, just really, done with people and the shit people have given me. 

Now I’m wondering if any of them would give me another chance because I see that and have changed a lot since then. Like, reaching back out.

What do you think?"
toptalent,fel1ru0,t1_fel0vbh,1579212191.0,"Wow! So you make all of your money with it now?

Do you sell mostly through galleries or do you sell directly mostly?

Do you have a website?"
Bumble,fel11zd,t3_epkeeh,1579211762.0,There is a point that you know they don’t care though. That or they are a horrible communicator. I’m not into either so I just say thanks for your interest but I need someone who’s a good communicator.
relationship_advice,fel0qsa,t1_fel0d8h,1579211578.0,"What if you left him on kindof bad terms or he wasn’t very nice to you initially?

Tinder,fekzyfa,t1_fekzsr0,1579211111.0,I’m asking why not make the things we have better and focus on that instead of always jumping to something new to solve a problem.
gaming,fekzqk5,t3_epn6hu,1579210982.0,Spoken so wisely.
pkmntcgcollections,fekzc0x,t3_epoy47,1579210740.0,NICE!!

NoStupidQuestions,fekykql,t1_fekvo2i,1579210281.0,If that is the appropriate way to do that okay. I just appreciate and want to give some recognition but okay.
NoStupidQuestions,feks770,t1_feks2jg,1579206507.0,"Yeah, I mean like, for recognition of someone who gilded me or something too. Like I can’t even show someone thanks and give recognition?"
DiWHY,fekryuy,t3_epm81m,1579206372.0,Wow. This must actually work pretty well for cooking purposes though. Also must have been difficult logistically.
clevercomebacks,fekrppl,t1_fekqfwc,1579206223.0,Right. I was thinking of editing in SLPT but apparently people here hate edits for some reason.
Ceramics,fekp70m,t1_fekotth,1579204732.0,Thank you! Now it’ll get done for sure (although I can’t promise when)
depression,fekp0bh,t1_fekoo7o,1579204621.0,"Yes it is and it’s a bitch when it’s so much of something you don’t enjoy doing as much as you need to get it done to better your life (make it more organized in this case). 

I just can’t wait when I can have that rejuvenating kind in a few days hopefully!

Thank you. Me too. I thought we were perfect for each other and I gave her everything. Now she couldn’t care less and I beat the burden. It’s not fair. I feel so alone now. Thank you."

depression,fekofb6,t1_fekn201,1579204278.0,"Yes. I imagine it is different for different people and for me it’s my ex and our relationship.

I’m currently on winter break and it is a godsend. I finally have the time to do what I’ve been neglecting for too long. But that’s a lot of things, and it feels like work to do them (because some people do those things for a career (like editing pictures I took of my artwork in Lightroom)).

So I’ve been enjoying the productivity (which is way less than I would like but some is better than none) but it’s felt like such a grind getting everything done.

I really want to get back into my studio and make things again this break before UNI starts up again. I’m sure I’ll get enough done to do that and I can’t wait until then."

There are some of those reasons of it’s bad enough but yeah social media should be off-limits to companies making decisions about you 99% of the time."

Gear is good, helps out for sure. But good companions are where it’s at. You get them through luck some how and keep them alive that goes way further than gear alone.

Yeah, cards do suck. That’s luck, but hopfully you can still play them well enough until they get shuffled back and get re-dealt."
