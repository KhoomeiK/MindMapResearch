AskReddit,fbx9hds,t1_fbwidnh,1577175554.0,"I did the same thing with the first guy my mom dated (the being really terrible, not the car wreck) when I was 14-15. My parents had been split up for 7 years or so & I don’t really remember my reasoning, though I think part of it was I just really hated big changes. I have a lot of guilt about my behaviors as a pre-teen/teen as a result."
