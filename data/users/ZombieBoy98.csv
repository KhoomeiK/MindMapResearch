Dogs shouldn’t be running around without a leash. I’m just saying this fear of dogs is hindering her daughters life. 
I’m not blaming the mother. You keep putting words in my mouth that’s all. Kids need to be taught these things."
MaladaptiveDreaming,ffjobmd,t1_ffjmu1x,1580002899.0,"I’ve only had a few friends. To be honest I’ve never really had a best friend. I was in foster care and moved round lots. I just learnt to be friends with myself. The truth is when I do meet a potential friend, it’s never mentally stimulating enough to pursue further friendship: I can’t enjoy it. I’d rather daydream about having a friend instead lol. I forget life is real sometimes"
AskReddit,ff95486,t3_esbya0,1579705062.0,"My sister killed herself while I was only 3 houses away. She was fighting with my older sister. My sister struggled with mental health issues and couldn’t look after her 6 month old daughter and asked my oldest sister to adopt her. She did. The next 7 years she abused drugs and fell into a toxic relationship. She had a son in 2016 and it was obvious she was struggling. My sister and I had a hard life being in care, being abused, struggling with mental health issues. Since my sister and my older one were fighting, on my oldest sisters birthday she killed her self. My mum was with my older sister. She had a fight with her boyfriend. She was all alone. I was only 3 houses away and I never went down to see her. I guess she didn’t want to contact my mum because she was with my big sister celebrating. She must of felt so lonely. My sister now holds intense guilt, knowing my sister killed herself in her birthday. I bet that stings. My oldest sister has been making terrible decisions ever since. Her heads not right. My sisters life was tragic and I wish I could helped her. She couldn’t look after her son anymore and she knew it. I wish I would of stepped in. My heart breaks when I think of my sisters death. She’s left behind a daughter and a son."
offmychest,ff4fffj,t1_ff4e06p,1579562319.0,"To be real, I don’t feel comfortable posting a good looking photo of myself if I feel like it doesn’t represent the real me. I feel like I’m conning people.  I make sure to take pictures showing all my flaws so people know what there getting into. When I don’t I feel like a fraud. 
I think a lot of guys pretend to be straight on gay websites lol. When I see someone describe themselves as such on a gay website I roll my eyes and ignore them. I like guys who are comfortable with themselves."
AskReddit,ff439vn,t3_erhu3x,1579554595.0,"Funny you said that. Last night I had a dream I was living in an apartment complex. Facing me was a famous movie star, I discovered his secret on how he looks good in every film. I. The dream if you covered your eyebrow area on your head with black? and stood a certain way Infront of the camera you will look handsome. I remember trying this out in the dream and it worked? I can’t remember what I put over my face but I looked at the footage and yes I did look quite handsome! I can’t remember what happened next but later in the dream I discovered he was a killer and I had to escape his apartment and people in the dream where telling me the people he killed and I knew I had to escape. 
I remember waking up dissapointed because I wanted to know what happened next. I can’t describe this any better this is all I remember from the dream. I know I’m weird"

I’m sorry but he doesnt have to forgive you. Do him a favour and leave him the hell alone. I pity your future partner....  

Hope you become a better person soon"
offmychest,ff32cxj,t3_er9hjq,1579531860.0,"Depression is a horrible illness. I lost my sister and best friend to suicide nearly 2 years ago next month and I think about her and what she is missing out on every day. It’s changed me as a person. I’m a lot more empathetic to people’s struggles now. I wish you the best man, i can’t tell you the pain will go away anytime soon but feel it and own it and let it make you a better person man. Wish you the best."

confession,fessdc4,t3_eqi6f4,1579368527.0,"I think your lying lol. Guys that get side chicks on the side don’t boast about on reddit. 
Keep wishing bro"
offmychest,fehe7lb,t1_feh7q0m,1579114719.0,"Was he like this as a kid? Mental illness can really change a persons personality. He does need some tough love I would find it hard to forgive after him stealing but if he’s in a bad place be there for him. Visit him to his house if he doesn’t get in touch. Make it a point to show you care. It must be infuriating to see your brother go down this road just remind him of the person he used to be. Let him know your relationship has suffered because of his actions and you want your old brother back. Have an honest conversation. He needs a wake up call.
Tbh your family don’t deserve this you guys have a lot of patience. Leave a door open for him if he decides to come back. 
Wish you luck regardless"
offmychest,feh69r4,t3_ep2p4e,1579110024.0,You seem like you don’t believe your Brother has mental health issues. All of the behaviour he’s displaying sounds very worrying. I have an aunt who has bipolar and she behaves the same way. If your that cold and uncaring towards his mental health I don’t blame him running away. He shouldn’t have stole the money though that’s disgusting behaviour. Your brother needs help. Sorry you have to go through this but validate your brothers issues and he might open up and tell you what’s wrong
offmychest,fcv8lcz,t1_fcv2gfg,1577996902.0,If that’s true many didn’t get the memo. Why was there so many references to the Wayne’s? I would like to view it as it’s own story but it’s got batman universe references all across the place. Claiming it isn’t is stupid. I have always liked the one bad day concept to be honest. It’s something everyone can relate too. A story like that never gets old. I just wish I could change a few things about the film and change the dialogue in certain scenes. I wish it left more to the imagination when it came to social commentary. Let us fill in the blanks
offmychest,fcuon2p,t1_fcuoghg,1577985417.0,"Phoenix sure is a gem I agree. His acting was amazing but I wish the writers gave him better material to work with because he’s worth it. 
Maybe I’ll watch it again to see if my opinion changes."
offmychest,fcuo964,t1_fcunx4b,1577985195.0,I can certainly see the relatability of it but I think there were better ways to advance the story and concept. I would of liked it more if it wasn’t about the Joker. I could relate to it as well but I just couldn’t get over the writing and the set up. I respect your opinion though and I’m glad you liked it! Atleast you were able to enjoy it lol I wish I was able too
confession,fanwvcd,t3_ea00f0,1576252439.0,What a privileged life you have. Sounds like your mum is already generous towards you and she has the funds to provide you everything you need and you repay her by doing this? I don’t know how wealthy your family is but regardless it’s disgraceful. I don’t mean to guilt you but I would feel like a terrible person if I done this on anyone paying it back or not. You better pay it back before she realises what you have done. Credit is one hard thing to earn. She could miss out on so much because of your bullshit.
