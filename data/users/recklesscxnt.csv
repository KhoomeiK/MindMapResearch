relationship_advice,ffeitgo,t3_et6p7u,1579849749.0,"Leave or give them a taste of pettiness that your roommate thought she could give you then leave. It’s really the only way - these type of people think that they aren’t in the wrong. At all. 

E.G Left trash next to bin? Put it in her room. If she puts it back out to the bin? Open the bag in her room, her belongings etc. & when she cries about it, just respond with something like “damn, I must’ve mistaken your room as the dumpster. Probably because you are a trashy piece of shit.” 

I had this happen to me last yr so I get this. There are just people out there that just don’t have the capacity to be a decent human being."

relationship_advice,ff2p7pb,t3_erbkix,1579517507.0,"If it is something you need to talk about to move on from it, you should. However, you also need to tell her about the other woman you were sleeping with. If you don't want to tell her then, you are being a hypocrite. 

What I would do? Mentally call it even and move on because you are just as bad. There is no point in bringing it up unless you have suspicions that she is cheating on you."
bipolar,ff2nn00,t3_er0riu,1579515086.0,"I don't handle it at all. Like at all. Like other comments, it really is best to leave that shit alone. 10/10 unfair (my 23 yr old heart cries over it every saturday night) but I prefer to not think I'm superwoman and drink myself to the point where I end up w alcohol poisoning."
bipolar,ff18kex,t1_feuv7l6,1579476315.0,Hi :) Medication (when on the correct ones) make your life a lot easier. It will teach you a lot about yourself and your condition. I hope you get better friend :)
