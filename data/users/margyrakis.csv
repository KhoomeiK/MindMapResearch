conspiracy,ffch3b3,t1_ffcff8q,1579799321.0,"I took a Native American studies class a couple years ago, so I guess I didn't remember precisely. I apologize. However, my point still stands - there is a sort of fluidity that has always existed among people, and it's not some agenda that is being pushed. It's not a conspiracy, imo. It's just acceptance of something that has always existed. It's having humanity."
conspiracy,ffcd84d,t1_ffc1t3c,1579796937.0,Certain American Indian tribes had members who were transgender before people came from Europe. It's really something that has always existed; it's just a matter of acceptance.
gadgets,ff4b65m,t1_ff44uk8,1579559528.0,"Samsung only *just* removed the headphone jack on their flagship phones. My S10, for example, still has a headphone jack and it's the latest phone in their S line."
gadgets,ff4avtv,t1_ff4483s,1579559344.0,"Right? I mean I'm not saying that Samsung's phones are perfect and will last forever, but neither do iPhones. I've had a Galaxy since the very first generation, and none of them have had issues that make the phone unusable in one way or another. I upgrade every two years. My brother has had a Galaxy S6 Active for years, and no problems whatsoever. 

On the other hand, my mom is constantly having to take her iphones to the Apple store for it to be fixed for ""antenna issues"" - many many times in the past 2 years. My boyfriend had an iPhone 7 that the microphone just stopped working before he was eligible for his upgrade, and the same thing happened to a close friend of ours. My friend's iPhone would just freeze all the time. These were all newer gen models when these issues occurred.

I just dislike the unnecessary hate that Samsung gets for unreliability when Apple isn't necessarily any better."

politics,feyesdd,t3_eqvscw,1579444506.0,"That's because Trump isn't a business man, he isn't anything other than a *personality* figure (other than a con, lol). That's why he holds these massive rallies and acts the way he does. That's how he's maintained his relevancy throughout the years despite it being known that he sucks at business. He's much better at marketing himself, for whatever that is worth."
galaxys10,feydevi,t1_fexo60b,1579444105.0,"Here in the US, there is definitely a stigma. Like for a college class, instead of making a group chat using a different app (or just using SMS)  every. time. they will just leave you out and message you separately away from the group because you don't have an iPhone. Though, most of the time they won't message you anyways.

There have also been multiple times that my whole class partakes in an iMessage group chat that everyone would keep a secret from me and eventually I *accidently* find out that there is a group chat that I've been left out of all year, lol. These people are my friends too.

The amount of times I've been told, ""Oh... you don't have an iPhone"" as if that is something to pity is astounding, lol.

I could honestly say sooo much about this topic."
GalaxyWatch,fetcyt4,t3_eqdy9a,1579374035.0,"The active sounds like a great option for all that you want to do! I got mine from Best Buy, and it's still available. If I were you, I'd personally look for an unopened one or lightly used one online from resell apps like Mercari. It could be risky, but I'm pretty sure Mercari has a money back guarantee on certain products if it turns out not to be legit or what you expected."

SkincareAddiction,feiaohb,t1_fei0bi5,1579134075.0,"Yes! Differin actually made my skin *soft* for the first time since I can remember! I'm 21 and have had acne ranging from moderate to severe since I was 11 or 12. But like you, the purging was absolutely awful for the first few months. My acne was the worst it had been in years! Buuuut, after 5 months of using Differin my acne was completely gone... And my skin was sooo nice üòä

Then, I got lazy.. and stopped using it for a couple of weeks, and of course my acne came back. üòÇ But I'm using it again, and it's going away again.

I can't recommend it enough, despite the awful first few months, lol.

Edit: and keep in mind I've tried everything under the sun for acne aside from Accutane. I had visited a derm while I was in middle school and was prescribed doxycycline and then minocycline, and of course I used Benzoyl Peroxide, Clindamycin, Salicylic Acid, sulphur, etc throughout the years since. My derm gave us epiduo samples when I was in middle school (adapalene and Benzoyl peroxide combo) and I loooved that stuff, but our insurance wouldn't cover it, so I had to stop. I truly believed had I been able to continue using it, my skin would be in much better shape.. I wouldn't have all these scars or massive pores, lol. Plus, I was very very self conscious of my acne throughout my adolescence."
GalaxyWatch,fei9np1,t3_ep2b0h,1579133395.0,"I've had mine since August, and I have one hairline scratch at the top. I'm sorry that happened to your watch :( 

The only other damage to my watch occured when I was walking and somehow slammed my wrist into the side of a concrete wall. I cringed when I looked at my watch and noticed that the aluminum had gotten scuffed. It's not bad at all though, considering how hard it hit. When I show people what happened, they can barely tell upon close inspection. I'm lucky the screen didn't crack or scratch or anything too, as the metal scuffed right along the bezel."
politics,fe2wo50,t1_fe2imci,1578843687.0,"It's because by the time one reaches high school, it's much more difficult to learn a language than when one is a child. Our brains are no longer hardwired for language development; although, they are when one is a child. Learning a foreign language is important, but it should be mandatorily implemented in elementary school."
politics,fe2ua7q,t1_fe2mezw,1578842936.0,"I agree. Also, I think a personal finance class would be a great way to get students into the habit of budgeting - show them how to do it and consistently implement it throughout their lives."

We didn't get it professionally installed though. Our painting is definitely crooked, and we've been debating whether the left or the right shelf sits higher. üòÇ

Also, my boyfriend took off a command strip, and I told him just to pull it straight down (and I removed one to show him myself), but since he didn't listen and just decided to yank the thing towards him out of impatience, the paint stripped. Now we have a decent chunk of exposed drywall with a screw in it and everything. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

cats,fd2m704,t3_ejv6y1,1578149209.0,"I think it really depends on the cat. I have one cat who loves being pet, whether it's on the face, belly, tail - he loves it all, haha. However, he haaaates being held and even snuggled. He's still an absolute sweetheart who wants pets 24/7. He's always been that way ever since he was a kitten. He would never sleep on your lap or anything, but he'd always have one paw outstretched just far enough to touch my hand or my leg. He's precious. ‚ù§Ô∏è

My other cat loves being held, snuggled, all that. He's so content just laying in your arms. If you're sitting down, there's a good chance that he's going to run and plop himself on your lap, and when you're laying down he'll curl up on your chest. Like my other cat, he loves pets as well.

I do believe that while all cats are different, most (if given good, loving homes who understand cat behaviors/communication) will adore their owners and will love snuggling with them. üòä"

With it, the back is made out of hard clear plastic, so the back hasn't yellowed even the slightest. However, the sides of the clear case are TPU, so they have definitely yellowed. I'm thinking that it's about time to replace it. I've been using clear cases for years, but I think I'm going to change it up."

politics,fcorn7v,t3_ei5x58,1577839702.0,"Oh my goodness YES. I recently watched the movie Dark Waters that's about the contaminated water in West Virginia thanks to DuPont. A few years ago, we got a letter saying that our water had too much of a certain chemical in it. The thing is, the current regulations are not nearly strict enough according to science, so really who knows how long we were being contaminated.

I ended up buying a pro controller because it was cheaper than buying a whole new set (and plus I had kinda been wanting one). But still, drift like that for controllers that expensive is ridiculous. It's a lot to put down 80 dollars for controllers every year. It doesn't matter how well you treat them."

Maybe that's not the case, but *I* feel like I notice a definite difference. I wonder if a test comparing 1440p vs 720p would show a difference. Still, unless I'm playing Pokemon Go I always have my display set to 1440p. It looks night and day better than 1080 and especially 720p."
