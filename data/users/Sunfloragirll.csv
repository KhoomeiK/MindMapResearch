OP needs therapy, and if they go to therapy they need to be as honest as possible. I know, as a fellow neglected kid, that being taken care of is marvelous, but romanticizing just creates dependant, weak and untrustworthy character, dependant relationships and further disappointment. People need to understand that kids are here to be taken care of, learn new things and not worry; but once this period go away, you can't hold onto the need of unfulfilled attention. *It's sad*, I'm cringing a little writing this because it's hurtful to think about, but **either you chose to become a functional or a broken adult because you'll become an adult nevertheless**, the success is up to you and your ability to seek treatment and work with it. What baffles me is how these supposed support groups influence a behavior that goes agaisnt getting better. They sink deep into their messes because it's easier, because it's less effort, until the darkness engulfs them and they become shitty people drowning into their own shit.

I sometimes pity people like this, like the ones we see in this sub of ours neck deep in their own fears and pulling everyone around to join them into their stinky pool of sorrow - the moment they stop being a victim and start being the toxic son of a bitch fucking with the emotions of others. Hey, munchies, I'm talking with you. Yeah, emotional trauma is a bitch, sexual abuse is hurtful as nothing else can be, negligence fucks people up, but at the end of the day God decided that no matter what He himself wants, salvation is up to us and what we do with our decisions.

Having an illnesses can be seen as an easy escape route to the ones that don't want to take on the obligations that life throw at you because, dude, life can be harsh.

illnessfakersgonewild,fdznzgr,t3_eng4en,1578792261.0,"I'm currently in medic school and I'm a firm believer of using alternative treatments to alleviate symptoms, pains, emotional suffering. Do you feel that ill spirits are worsening your headaches? Fine, let's make a cleanse, it helps with the anxiety of believing in it. The biggest reason for my stance is because I was raised in a big city by a family who consulted a witch doctor constantly. I've seen cancer patients being saved by religion, not because faith cured them, but because it helped them cope when they were going into the deepest depression. This stuff can help, but people simply don't get that a palliative is exactly that: a palliative.

It's fucking hard because I can't express myself as an aspiring scientist who has a strong faith because all the pseudo-science lovers turn shit into a whole mess that I don't want to go into. My family's witch doctor was an amazing sweet man and I'm sure his soul is in a happier place, he was a strong believer of medicine, but the emotional support he gave us was outstanding. I was a suicidal kid, and he was by my side guiding me when no one knew how to deal with it. You can't alienate people who believe in alternative medicine because if you do so they won't come back to modern medicine. I've seen it first hand. But it's a hella hard balance because if you give alternative medicine too much credit you can also have people never going back to modern medicine. For God's sake, Karen, burning plants won't cure your pneumonia, believe me, but if you take this medicine and pray a lot you are going to get better quicker.

What the fuck.


A big fat what the fuck.


As a woman with OCD who had severe delusions, paranoia, psychosis and hallucinations during my teen years, why are these kids treating it as a personality trait? My main goal has always been to reach normality (and thanks God I'm near it rn) not to treat all the daily rituals and self harm as a quirky idiosyncrasy. ""Say hello to my system"" NO, GOD, NO. NO. IT'S NOT CUTE. Gosh, and I see people my age or even older doing this.

Picking my hair until I bald and bitting my fingers until they bled were my little quirks and shit wasn't cute. Why are people treating a mental illness as something cute? As something that is part of their personalities? Gosh, no, don't present your alters, fucking kill them with therapy. This can't be healthy, to act like you love being mentally tortured by a mental illness. In my opinion, either you don't have the illness or, if you do, you are going into a very dark path of choosing not to seek a healthier life, just as seen in fatlogic thinking.

fatlogic,fc6a79h,t1_fc5lbts,1577475835.0,"I'm not American, but I have a small grasp of what SAT is because my country has a similar national test. Hate this shit, most of my grades are based on research and presentation since high school because my dyslexic ass can't mark little balls without messing up. I used to hate the academy and every instance of it (school, college) thinking it would be all about marking those god-damned balls, but discovering that at least my uni valorizes research and presentation so much made me kinda... Like studying. A lot. I guess this could be transfered to fat activists as well, many think that dieting is all about very expensive programs and self loathing, but if they ever learn that dieting can turn into a nice thing - discovering new foods, asking friend for help, learning that cooking can be an anti-stress activity, turning eating into more of a sacred moment than a painful and addictive one, feeling self love by taking care of their health, discovering healthier and more fulfilling coping mechanisms - there wouldn't be so much people hating it. At least that's what I saw on friends that lost weight and became way happier about themselves."

Studying more would go agaisnt my natural state of playing videogames all day!"" Who cares if I kill a patient in the future?, effort, dedication and sacrifice towards reaching a higher goal are unhealthy! I'm wasn't born to think about studies all day!"
fatlogic,fbh5w8s,t1_fbguji5,1576866029.0,"Lipedema is way more dangerous than Prader-Willi in a physical sense. If a Prader-Willi person has a nice caring system, they are able to keep an ok weight - the biggest problem is overall lack of prepare and knowledge of the caretakers. But when it comes to lipedema, shit not only hurt but deforms a person, and it can cause immobility and severe pain. Still the fat distribution is different from obesity and if a FA claims it they are literally calling their ""healthy"" disease a very painful condition. How ironic."
