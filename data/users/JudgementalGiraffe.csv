One day he says ""No more!"" and clogs himself permanently the next time a human pooped in him. After the humans decide to scrap the toilet to the junk yard he escapes and embarks on an adventure to discover the truth, meeting memorable friends along the way such as a toilet brush and a roll of toilet paper."
