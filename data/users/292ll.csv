ElizabethWarren,fgst2j3,t1_fgssbx9,1581092069.0,"Oh, I’ll be sure not to stray from the party line, comrade.  The lack of acknowledgement by the Democratic Party as a whole that we actually need to think about and encourage others to support someone that might be their second or third choice is appalling.  It’s literally why trump won.  
  
I don’t live in an “I only love warren bubble” and have a real understanding that Amy is taking votes from Warren.  Bernie and Warren are splitting a similar group of voters, etc. It’s just a reality.  Let’s all put on our grown up pants and take down trump."

ElizabethWarren,fgshzjs,t1_fgsfux9,1581084818.0,"It’s never to early to discuss supporting another candidate.  We have trump because of Bernie Bro’s and Johnson voters.  Again, I love Warren, probably
more than any candidate I have ever come across, but the stakes are too high against trump.  
  
I want to add that Biden’s underperformance helps as it looks like the moderate vote will be split by him and Pete, with the liberal vote split between Bernie and Warren.  A month ago I was terrified that it would be Biden 40%, Warren 20%, Bernie 20%, everyone else..."

ElizabethWarren,fgse8af,t3_f06otd,1581081882.0,"I am a warren supporter, but over performing 538’s low expectations is “fine” at best.  The fact remains that Warren has to come in first or second in at least a handful of these first 20 states.  It’s not looking good.  As a Democrat who hates trump and wants him out as a first priority and loves Warren as a second priority, if she can’t show a legit shot at winning after Super Tuesday I hope she drops out to send her votes to Bernie, who has relatively similar policies to Warren (and if she agreed to drop out could strong arm him into adopting a couple of hers)."

DelphiMurders,ffftbkf,t1_fffmw9i,1579891345.0,"Fair enough.  I respectfully disagree.  In order to get to an answer they have to make reasonable and informed conclusions.  For instance if they have that image, then 30 seconds later “down the hill” then 2 minutes later a scream or something clearly showing  a bad situation, all on the same video, I am good with them concluding that person is either BG, worked in concert with the killer, or knows a whole lot.

DelphiMurders,ffflvpv,t3_etabi2,1579886773.0,"I think within the realm of reason they are certain he is the guy because the video recording (where they got the still image) continues.

Sure maybe a 1:1000000000 chance.  Keep in mind if that mythical innocent gentleman had been there, in Delphi, he would have been very aware of what happened and the investigation - it’s not like he is in Hong Kong and it slipped by him.

One would think Derek may have seen BG exiting the area on foot or car, unless BG parked somewhere else (I assume there were other lots/spots) or they returned home foot or potentially parked very far away.  The “on foot” theory is interesting for the FL suspect, depending on what they dig up.  It seems very likely that they encountered BG on the “other side” of the bridge.  Does that all make sense?
