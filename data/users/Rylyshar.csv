Put him on the front passenger seat with seatbelt through the bag loop and kept my hand near his head. Once he got his feet under him in the bag he actually drifted off a few times with his head on my hand. Absolutely worth the cost!"

space,fdmgzui,t3_em33e9,1578549588.0,"If you think you're interested in astronomy, do NOT start by buying a telescope – ESPECIALLY a scope under $200, they are WORTHLESS (except for moon viewing). 

Buy a really good pair of binoculars (maybe around $100). Those are easier to use and provide better quality optics than what many famous astronomers used in the past. Get a good sky-map app or field guide to the stars. And find a local astronomy club! Amateur astronomers love to share their hobby. You'll learn about the different kinds of telescopes, and get to try them out. You'll find out what's best for the type of observing – or photography – that you want to pursue. you might even get a great deal on someone's old equipment.

But if, by chance, you end up NOT getting really into the hobby, you still have a great pair of binoculars that can be used in other ways.

If you do really get into the hobby, you will spend $200 on ONE QUALITY EYEPIECE for a telescope, and you'll want multiple eyepieces. 

Spouse and I are amateur astronomers, own a 10"" collapsible Dobsonian (Teleport® custom-made) with over a half-dozen various eyepieces. Along with two good-quality binocs, gobs of star charts, sky-mapping apps and red flashlights. And I've given numerous speeches and a pecha-kucha presentation about the above."

AskReddit,fdm7z7x,t3_em34sh,1578542045.0,"Babylon 5. First sci-fi series with an actual 5-year outline. I mean, DS9 was great, especially the last episodes, but Babylon 5 was so real and believable. People were complex, alien races were different, the entire world was just so deep and ancient and real. When you watch it again, so much is hinted at right from the beginning! I bawled on the last episode, and still do when I hear the music ""Sleeping in Light."""
AskReddit,fdm7ppm,t1_fdm7esv,1578541852.0,"the last episode, though – too much crammed into one episode. I mean, I loved it, but a lot of the mystery and danger had to be cut out. SO grateful we got that last episode, though!!"

Dallas,fdi8kp6,t1_fdi7sct,1578437674.0,"I guess I need to say, I hope those who are contemplating suicide can realize that reaching out, just a little bit, can help you to see that the problem isn't worth giving up, that you've survived all your worst days, and it's worth keeping at it; also, it's no shame to reach out for a medical adjustment to help your brain chemistry improve. But for those who do follow through, there are ways that are ways that are horrible and traumatic to innocent bystanders. Why inflict that on others?"

Right up there with the customer who walked into the Classical section, which also includes Jazz — which is right in the front, with header cards and an overhead sign saying “JAZZ.” Staring straight at all the signage, they asked, “Where is the Jazz?”"
television,fdcpo0g,t1_fdasonh,1578280896.0,I agree. I can deal with flashbacks to explain characters’ back stories. Just do something like giving us  little captions as we jump to different timelines. I do think it was a good way for us to understand the characters better.
Supernatural,fcvdeyp,t1_fcv3ozr,1577999771.0,No they haven’t. They are a number of episodes ahead but only the outline and the ending are done.

I got to 1,639 days, and then was either at a convention with no nearby portal or was dealing with my mom being ill and in a hospital that I drove down to, and somewhere in there I lost it. What’s done is done, and now, dealing with a mom who has been in and out of hospital and rehab, plus a new job in a new town, it’s been a bit of a relief to not have to panic about that count."
Toastmasters,fcoefu7,t3_ei8lbc,1577830242.0,"As you’re learning, you can concentrate on topics that you like, especially ones that you’re passionate about. What can you talk about endlessly because it’s something you enjoy or do as a hobby or just find fascinating? It’s something you are an expert about because of your interest in it. You most likely know more about that topic than anyone else, so it will be new information for your audience. Plus, since it’s a topic you love, it’s easier to talk about it. Chose one aspect of your topic and expand that into your 5-7-minute speech. Don’t try to tell everything — there are always more speeches to give. Focus on one central message and have your support points and stories reinforce that message. 

You may have noticed one of the cool things about Toastmasters is the tremendous variety of topics you hear! Add to that with speeches about what you love. And all the best!"

Our other cat, who usually gets along wonderfully with him, would attack him every time he yowled in pain. We took him to an emergency vet. He is not currently blocked (which would be $2-3K) but has been just curled up since we brought him back. I have medicine to give him for nausea and pain, but he hasn’t been eating or drinking. He is more responsive than he was last night, though. Tomorrow I’ll need to take him to the regular vet and have them run tests. I’ve had this cat for 12 years, he is the most affectionate, loving, cuddly, easy-going sweetheart I’ve ever owned. I’m so worried. :("
