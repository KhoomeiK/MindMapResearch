Python, and many other beginner languages, tend to hide away typing from the developer.

But it can bite you later, because nothing in python will stop you trying to add 4 to ""cat"". Python in particular doesn't have a compiler, so it won't look ahead in your code to find problems like this. 

Python also allows you to implicitly declare variables. Which means it won't pick up spelling mistakes. You can use the variable brainSize throughout your code. Then if you accidentally use brianSize once instead, Python will happily create a new variable and not tell you about the mistake.

* Scope variables as small as possible to do the job

education,ff4otnf,t3_erdt9b,1579568843.0,"The huge advantage of private religious schooling is that its expensive. Only wealthy parents can afford it. This means your kids tend to hang out with other kids that come from wealthy backgrounds. Wealth tends to make everything better. Kids are better fed, better behaved, have two parents at home, have less trauma, have more engaged parents, have better resources, score better on tests and so on. There is almost no metric where those with more money don't score better than those with less. 

Through some quirks of charity laws, its easier and cheaper to set up a private school with a religious focus. You can cut out a bunch of taxes and oversight by claiming ""God told me to do it"". Which means many private schools which cater to the wealthy are nominally religious. Which brings us to the major downside of private religious schooling. Religious schools are religious. 

Schools frequently try and instill religious values in their students. Some values like helping out your fellow humans or vegetarianism are harmless. Other values like homophobia or patriarchy can be quite damaging.  Religious schools are also more likely to employ religious chaplains instead of councilors. This can lead to students getting less than ideal advice on mental health issues or sex education. 

The religious views of the school can also compromise the actual educational material. This is frequently common when teaching evolution in biology. But it has effects on the rest of the curriculum too. English classes will be restricted in what texts they can use. Art classes will avoid masters that painted nudes. And so on.

Finally students will often get instructional time taken up with a compulsory religious class. Often complete with homework, assessments, tests, and mandatory passing requirements. School is tough enough without requiring work on a religion that may be different to what the student actually believes."

If you are willing to google scientific papers that offer evidence either way, I'm sure some people will be interested in reading them."
Teachers,ff4jza3,t3_erm4rm,1579565447.0,"It can be helpful to remind students that they are not at school because they know stuff. They are in class to learn new stuff.  

Learning is hard. Students should expect to be wrong more often than they are right. However we often set up our educational environments to reward being right and penalise being wrong. This leads to kids being afraid of being wrong. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to the dark side. Or at the very least, fear leads kids to stop trying."

The replication crisis is roughly correlated to the maturity of the science. Stuff that's still in observation tends to be difficult to replicate. Stuff that has advanced well into mathematics is often very easy to replicate."
education,ff4ikuf,t1_ff3l2y3,1579564476.0,"But what you can do in education research is compare existing behaviors. Its not as robust as a control group. But its still useful.

That's how we know that having breakfast actually does increase test scores. We simply recorded students existing behavior around breakfast and correlated it to their test results."

Its often not super important which exact direction you go. There are literally thousands of satisfying career paths which will work for you. Whats important is that you are going somewhere."
Teachers,ff4g6jh,t3_erl7xk,1579562830.0,">Explained consequence: I will take your quiz and only grade what is completed (not a zero - I feel like even this is lenient). No questions, everyone understood.

That is rather lenient. One of our art teacher recently ripped a students exam in half and threw it away for improper exam conduct. And that's kinder than they will be treated during the national exams or at university, where they are likely to have their entire year invalidated if there is a suspicion of cheating.

Kids now whisper of the event in hushed tones in the corridors. Its likely rumors of it will become school legend over the next few years. But more importantly the kid learnt their lesson on exam etiquette and will never make that mistake again."

Chemical engineers go into mining, oil and gas, and manufacturing. Which means there are lots of jobs near deposits whenever the resource price is high. But those jobs disappear quickly when the price drops. Manufacturing jobs basically follow the lowest wage economy."
learnprogramming,ff2psm3,t1_ff1x2l9,1579518374.0,"That works if you have nice clean boundaries around what is the language and what isn't. But the real world often isn't that simple. 

Almost every language has a bunch additional libraries in common use, which makes the language definition fuzzier. Plus there are always multiple version of a language that often have significant variations. 

Learn what you need to get the task at hand done. And don't stress too much about getting the 100% achievement."
