Nenhum país tem direito de atacar outro sem haver algo comprovado como ato de guerra.  E mesmo assim há de haver diplomacia!  . Se os iranianos tem o governo que tem então eles que se resolvam.  Nenhum  país tem o que se meter! Assim qualquer país poderá sofrer algo semelhante!  Qualquer um! So inclusive o Brasil.  Basta eles aqui “acharem” uma razão de “desconfiança”!
