dogs,ffhbv92,t3_etmh8s,1579929233.0,It would have to be some disaster like long term hospitalization or something like that. But even then I think a friend or family member would take care of my dogs. I seriously hope it’s never something I have to consider. I feel so bad for people that truly have no choice.
puppy101,ffh40zj,t3_etlcuo,1579922517.0,There’s really nothing you can do after the fact
puppy101,ffgvcqw,t3_eti65g,1579916004.0,Try a long line and just keep walking without any pressure on the leash. Try to encourage puppy to follow but don’t force and lots of treats when he does follow you. I’m fortunate to have a place where I don’t need to use a leash at home so I do the same thing without a leash. When we go out in public I have a leash obviously but never really put pressure on it. I just have my pup follow me just like at home with no leash.
puppy101,ffguyjb,t3_etixwb,1579915721.0,My dog loves her naps so I let her self regulate. Some days she doesn’t quiet down until bed time and some days we play and then she naps and then plays again before bed. She’s in her crate all day while I work though so I don’t mind doing all the activity she wants in the evening. On weekends it seems like she keeps the same schedule and naps heavily during the day and is more active in the afternoon and evening. I’ve only enforced a nap once when she just wouldn’t stop biting me and could not be redirected.
dogs,ffgr5ng,t1_ffgqd55,1579912957.0,I don’t either lol. I guess they think leashes should be used regardless of rules/laws? Or they’ve never been around a dog with reliable recall and the ability to stay within boundaries so they don’t understand how that works? I have no idea.
dogs,ffgkklf,t1_ffgjxy4,1579908372.0,Absolutely! When required!
dogs,ffgkhyv,t1_ffghsd7,1579908323.0,"As I said she’s either on my property or in areas where off leash dogs are allowed so I have no obligation to leash her. When it is required she is leashed although it’s pretty much just decoration because she’s trained. Also, she does not approach people and especially not dogs. If I have to pass by people or dogs in a tight space I put her at heel on the opposite side of the people (mostly to make it clear I don’t want people or dogs to interact with her). If my one off leash trained dog upsets you so much I wonder what you’d think about the pack of hounds that run free on fox hunts (no foxes harmed)."
dogs,ffggss8,t1_ffgavf9,1579905900.0,I’m not tying her up while I’m working outside or leaving her inside. It’s just not going to happen. That’s not the kind of life I want for my dogs and it’s completely unnecessary on a 20 acre farm. I’m also not going to leash her on hikes unless it’s required. In that case we are both safer with her having the freedom to choose her own path and speed up/ slow down as needed. My local off leash dog park isn’t even fenced in. Not all dogs need to be leashed to be safe.
dogs,ffgg779,t1_ffg5wfc,1579905511.0,Why? I spent a ton of time and a decent amount of money on off leash training. I’m not going to tie my dog up while I’m working outside. There’s no reason to do that.
dogs,ffg8y8l,t1_ffg4mcz,1579901020.0,How do I know what? She doesn’t go out without me so I know where she is generally. I hope nothing happens too but I’m not going to put her in a bubble just in case. She’s happy and very healthy.
dogs,ffg2m7u,t1_ffg1f4j,1579897117.0,It’s not ignorant. Clearly nobody agrees with you. And I said depending on weather conditions. Usually a half decent rain will take care of it in my experience. But the important thing is it’s not your property and you are disrespecting the wishes of the people who do own the property. They are the ones that get to determine what bothers them and it turns out it’s you!
dogs,ffg0zup,t1_fffzzp1,1579896113.0,It’s even worse because op is littering with something that is very much not biodegradable while poop will degrade fairly quickly depending on the weather conditions. Not to mention they are disobeying the wishes of the people that own the property they are littering on. The audacity is mind blowing.
dogs,ffg0nf9,t1_fffpsdq,1579895902.0,I only use a leash where leash laws demand one. My dog does not approach strange dogs or people (unless the people talk to her) and has great recall. She always goes out unleashed at home but has never left my property.
dogs,fffzymy,t3_etf1wb,1579895481.0,My dog is only on a leash when legally required and then it’s a very lightweight one I made myself. I have no issue with off leash dogs as long as they don’t approach strange people or dogs and have an excellent recall.
dogs,ffe4jqt,t3_et46fz,1579836513.0,At 13 years old a lab doesn’t usually have much life left and arthritis tends to be a big issue. I would only do palliative treatment and euthanize when the dog no longer has a decent quality of life. I wouldn’t want to put my elderly dog through aggressive treatment when there realistically isn’t much quality time left in their life. I’d just spoil the dog and make it as happy as possible for the time it has left.
dogs,ffe0ey4,t1_ffdydlv,1579833472.0,Oh don’t get me started on irresponsible use of antibiotics lol
dogs,ffdxcs1,t3_et20lf,1579831268.0,"I haven’t had a dog with MRSA but in college I had a roommate with MRSA. I volunteered with pediatric oncology patients who had no immune system so I contacted the infection control department of the hospital. I was told to bathe the dog in a dilute bleach solution and wipe down the house. But I was fine to come to the hospital as usual. A small percent of the general population carries MRSA (in the nose) but close to 30% of healthcare workers carry it. I know I carry it or at least I did in college because I swabbed my nose and cultured it. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it but if you are worried about catching it you can purchase hibiclens over the counter now which is Chlorhexidine soap. If you have any wounds, even small ones keep them covered. Practice extra hand washing."
dogs,ffdwpos,t1_ffdv8ig,1579830811.0,MRSA is methicillin resistant. There are antibiotics that can treat it.
dogs,ffbyr9x,t3_esru2u,1579787014.0,I don’t leave toys in the kennel. My adult dog won’t chew toys in her kennel and I don’t feel it’s safe for my puppy. My dogs go in their kennel with no collar and only have their beds.
puppy101,ffaes82,t3_esbyyg,1579733989.0,My puppy (nearly 12 weeks) is out of her kennel whenever I am home except at bedtime. I do shut her in the bathroom with me while I shower but otherwise she has access to the whole house. She’s always near me anyway though. If I need some peace and quiet I give her a chew. She doesn’t have accidents inside anymore but when she did I would see and take her out immediately.
fasting,ff9n25i,t1_ff9mrrt,1579716432.0,I started yesterday evening. Sitting with my team while they ate my favorite food at lunch was hard but it is going to be so worth it! Good luck!
fasting,ff9305u,t3_es69wd,1579703594.0,I’ll join you!
dogs,ff7qkm7,t1_ff7pp17,1579655945.0,It’s easy to stop spending time on training with adult dogs that already behave well. I’ve definitely done it. But every time I pick it back up with my older dog it’s easy to see how much happier she is. Makes me feel so guilty that I stopped!
dogs,ff7ogmr,t3_es3qod,1579654462.0,I have a new puppy and so for the first time ever I have two dogs. The puppy probably could graduate to sleeping in my bed but I let bedtime be my older dog’s time to cuddle and be alone. The puppy goes on every possible outing right now for socialization purposes so that’s her time alone with me. I also train her individually but I put my older dog in a down/stay while I train the puppy. This makes her happier than me leaving her inside alone while I work with the puppy. My older dog has been great with the new addition so I make sure to reward her with lots of fetch. When they are older I’ll make sure to do individual activities with them at least once or twice a week just to make sure I build a solid bond with my new puppy and maintain the bond with my older dog.
dogs,ff7i35z,t3_es2sad,1579650061.0,The ouch method worked great for my dog when she was a puppy but with my new puppy it seems to encourage her. Ignoring does seem to help a little but it took a couple of weeks so don’t give up! Such an adorable puppy!
fasting,ff653el,t1_ff64zof,1579619337.0,Thanks! Maybe I’ve just been trying to take too much.
fasting,ff63vco,t1_ff50rnl,1579618474.0,How much pink salt do you take per day? On my last fast I struggled to take any sort of salt without feeling horribly nauseated. I tried taking it all at once and drinking it slowly.
fasting,ff63j94,t3_ersnm2,1579618235.0,"Any form of weight loss requires restriction no matter what method you choose to accomplish that. I’d argue that most people that are overweight have disordered eating and a poor relationship with food already which they are trying to address. Of course there are many other reasons that people fast which are completely unrelated to weight or body image. Can fasting become disordered if taken to an extreme? Sure. So can every other diet. This is not an eating disorder sub. If you struggle with an eating disorder, especially one that includes restriction this is definitely not a sub you should participate in."
fasting,ff5xxkz,t3_ern3gp,1579613871.0,I started a 7 day fast yesterday but maybe I’ll extend it to 10! Good luck to everyone!!
dogs,ff5pbkp,t3_erq6y5,1579604507.0,I’m no expert but I’ve seen other videos of impressive jumps like that and usually the dog is caught and lowered to the ground gently. I see no issue with training things like that for sport or for working dogs or even for fun. Clearly the dogs love it and it’s better than sitting on the couch bored out of their minds. But when training I think all possible precautions should be in place to minimize joint damage. This is only one video so maybe this guy does catch the dog 99% of the time and this one jump for show was the exception. If that’s the case I don’t see anything wrong with it and I think he’s a responsible owner for working with his extremely athletic dog and challenging it appropriately.
dogs,ff30sug,t3_erdo6e,1579530628.0,No accidents in the house all weekend! And her first two trips to the dog park. It was my first time at this dog park and it’s amazing! When the puppy got overwhelmed by too many big dogs we were able to just walk trails where we crossed paths with one or two dogs at a time.
dogs,ff2ztoo,t3_erddae,1579529817.0,I have always adopted my dogs and I think it’s a great thing to do. But there is a place for responsibly bred dogs and if you’d like to go that route there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you feel strongly about adoption then you can expand your radius and check all the animal shelters regularly. Either look at online posts or call and ask if there are puppies available. I have found my puppies by checking daily for months until the right dog showed up.
dogs,ff1vmr1,t3_er6fjz,1579487190.0,For $200 you’re likely to get a poorly bred lab that may or may not have health and behavioral problems. It’s not worth the risk and it’s not worth giving your money to someone that isn’t breeding responsibly.
dogs,ff1v17q,t1_ff1s2dm,1579486807.0,"I started using the pellets for my horse’s stall and they are so much better than the shavings! With the humidity and her pacing they turn to a soft fine bedding in a couple of days. I’ve heard it’s good for cats too, and way cheaper than litter. I can’t remember what brand my bed is but it’s only waterproof on one side. But I’m betting they make them completely waterproof. Usually there’s an interior piece that’s waterproof with a fabric cover so the whole bed isn’t fully waterproof but you could just use the inside part."
dogs,ff1rlkf,t3_er5v16,1579484629.0,You could use pine shavings in the dog house or pine pellets. With the pellets you can wet them to make them into more of a soft bedding. They will dry back out and absorb any moisture very well. Pine shavings absorb moisture too but not as well as the pellets. Straw or hay isn’t a bad idea either. That’s probably easier to brush off of their fur when it’s time to come inside. Or you could get a waterproof dog bed and cover it in a crib sheet. They are pretty cheap and you could just change them out as needed and wash them.
dogs,ff1qi4p,t1_ff1q3tv,1579483940.0,Yea I don’t have any good advice either other than don’t take it outside for the night but that probably isn’t helpful. My otherwise well behaved dog would probably scratch a hole in my door if I shut her outside for the night.
dogs,ff1pzlt,t1_ff1lsf6,1579483609.0,That’s good advice! But it sounds like the op is taking the dog out to leave it outside overnight and the dog knows to hide when it’s almost time to go out.
dogs,ff19tj9,t3_er30xn,1579476645.0,I didn’t discourage the behavior in my dog because I want her to alert me to people near my house. She is by no means a protector but she is good at alerting me. Luckily when I did live close to a street it was at the end so there wasn’t much traffic. She wouldn’t bark at the neighbors either on foot or in their cars but she would bark at any strangers or strange vehicles.
dogs,fezbff2,t1_feyzmaf,1579455677.0,I’m currently working with my dog to only follow commands when they follow her name now that I have two dogs. So sit doesn’t always mean sit. But the dog is definitely capable of learning a new name. Dogs are commonly renamed when adopted and they do just fine.
puppy101,fevql56,t3_eqq7fw,1579400319.0,You can work on a leave it command. I use that command to mean ignore whatever it is you’re interested in whether it’s food on the ground or people walking by. If people ask to pet and you are ok with it you can give the dog a release command. He’s still young so it will take time to learn but it will be worth it. I can hike with my dog off leash and she won’t go up to dogs or people unless the people speak to her first.
dogs,feswwcn,t3_eqhnvb,1579369776.0,My parents had a dog before I was born. She was my best friend growing up. About a year after we had to put her down we adopted one at the shelter. I had to put her down after my sophomore year of college which was the same time I moved out of the dorm. The next week I got my first dog that was mine and not my family’s. He was older and I only had him for a bit over two years and then I adopted my first puppy. Now 6 years later I adopted my second puppy and have two dogs for the first time!
dogs,feq1amo,t3_eqdv0p,1579335987.0,Lots of dog breeds are routinely docked with no negative consequences. Not saying the practice is good or bad just saying it’s fairly common. It’s still a very young puppy and they are resilient so I’m sure it will be fine and the only long term effect will be aesthetic. The vet did the right thing. I don’t believe tails heal well and it sound like the puppy’s was badly injured.
dogs,feq083b,t3_eqdfyw,1579335457.0,A high quality food should be enough for most dogs. I personally wouldn’t supplement unless my vet recommended it because I’m just not super educated on dog nutrition. I did choose a puppy food with glucosamine for joint health. About the only thing I’m comfortable with supplementing on my own is a joint supplement just because I’ve used those a lot in the past and I know what to look for to find a good one.
