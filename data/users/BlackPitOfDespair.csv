I would say leave, that’s what I did in a similar situation. There is also the concept of living detachment. Protect yourself emotionally so if the time comes you have something left to give if she seeks real help. Also the child needs you as well. 

Leaving may spur her to seek more treatment and if so be there to help but always take care of yourself. You cannot control her but you can control how you deal with her."

Also sexual and romantic attraction does not have to go hand in hand. You could be bisexual but hetero-romantic for example. It is very much a spectrum and we all experience it in a unique way."

lgbt,fc4khwj,t3_eg4o0e,1577419326.0,If you are attracted to more than one gender you would fall on the bisexual spectrum.  More specifically you might be pansexual if you don’t care at all about gender. It doesn’t have to be any sort of even split and can even shift over time or cycle.
lgbt,fc3zrwk,t3_efy5su,1577402864.0,"Bisexuality is a spectrum it doesn’t have to be 50/50. You could be 95% women to 5% men. Also your sexuality could be shifting. It happens to people and in some cases, like myself, can even cycle over time. Basically I say be who you are and if others have a problem with it they are not your friend. 

It sort of sounds like you may have some internalized biphobia to deal with. 

I personally do have problems w/homo and heteroflexible as it does show biphobia, creates erasure, and shows lack of commitment. It gives the person the option to run back into the closet when things get tough."
lgbt,fc1p3u0,t3_efny7i,1577325262.0,I would agree. Exclusive hetereosexual marriage relationships was allegedly championed by Paul of Tarsus and so is embedded in conservative religion. Anyone not following that is an outsider and therefore open to persecution.
