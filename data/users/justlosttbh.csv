Thank you."
selfimprovement,fed71bx,t1_fec4ai9,1579001915.0,"Yeah! You have a point there! If it helps, I was in a similar situation until I cleared out my thoughts and focused on doing the things I needed to do, instead of all the things, and that helped a lot."

selfimprovement,fe7e76x,t3_eo05yr,1578913405.0,"I strongly recommend doing a dopamine-fast, the benefits you'll reap are wonderful.

 In my personal experience, it resets willpower and motivation, plus it energices you and motivates you incredibly, and it also, helps clear out your thoughts and focus on the things you desire and feel, like, I felt discomfort and sadness at the beginning, and embracing those feelings with nothing to distract me from them enabled me to find the source of the negative feelings, fix things, focus on what I TRULY wanted, and I'm way happier now. 

Also, I think it's beneficial to do one periodacally. I do a dopamine-fast every week, and I try to minimise the activities that give us a lot of ""dopamine highs"" or ""rewards"" without really earning them such us: junk food, porn, or the internet, I also minimise mi use of electronic devices. 

A dopamine-fast consists in a whole day (or the whole weekend) were de only things you can do are: sleep, drink water (you can't eat during the fast), write your thoughts (you can't read anything or consume any source of information besides your own thoughts, this includes being with other people, you need to be alone) exercise (with no music or podcasts), meditate, go for a walk, and activities were only you and your body are involved, you can't use anything else besides yourself. 

You can't however, eat, jerk-off, watch any form of video, movie or series, listen to any music (you can sing), listen to any podcasts or any form of talk shows, interact with any people, consume any form of information, enter any sort of social media, or basically, do any activity that requires an external source (from yourself) to be done. 

I won't lie, it's tough at first. But really, being alone with your thoughts and your life and feeling happy is a bliss. And in the beginning you may encounter discomfort or negative emotions, but understanding them can be the starting point of a happy life.

Hope this post helps you!"

This I've been told by close friends who were trying to help me, now I know that I can't show too much affection from the start, people have to gain your trust, but in my class everyone already has that perception of me, and I do know many of my peers and talk to them and sit with them and have a nice time with them, but I feel excluded, as though I'm just there: because I am. I'm not invited to events, or included in things or conversations, and in the end I go back to my needy and weak ways just because I start being too nice in order to get tagged along, I want to know how to make friends with people who you already know and who don't dislike you, but they don't like you either. Thank you."
