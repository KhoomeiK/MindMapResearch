wholesomememes,fejissc,t3_epdhty,1579176088.0,"I love the principle of this, I think it's quite sweet. However, I feel this would make it harder for people to let go of him and accept that he's gone. I also wouldn't want him doing more work than he needs to."
DuggarsSnark,fei4gnv,t3_ep7v18,1579130072.0,How dare these sinful women expose their bare ankles and necks! How about every woman just wears a burka and be done with it!

The10thDentist,fe2wfs7,t3_enfzhn,1578843625.0,I just got a shiver down my spine reading that shit.
TLCUnexpected,fe2vw79,t1_fe2t277,1578843390.0,"I think she was definitely very irresponsible and irrational before getting pregnant. I think that once she became a mom, she stepped up a bit."
TLCUnexpected,fe2opfs,t1_fdyjea7,1578841281.0,I think her miscarriage drove her to get pregnant even more. I also buy into the theory that she and her sister and cousin had a pregnancy pact. It's just too coincidental they all got pregnant so close together.
TLCUnexpected,fe2oam4,t3_enidnx,1578841144.0,"I'm very concerned. As you said, she's generally irrational, not to mention her brain is still developing. And considering her family's history of drug use, I hope this doesn't spiral into something worse."
