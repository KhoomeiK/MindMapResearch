I think the even/odd number sizing here depends on the store you go to, which is pretty silly imo, I can't figure the use of having two different systems. Though I suppose you can be dramatically different sizes between shops anyway, so might as well make up the numbers ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

AskReddit,fezxfkj,t1_feybrxg,1579462945.0,"For me, I was falling to pieces from work stress and a bad breakup and just needed to get through the day by any means necessary (getting fired would have made everything much worse lol). I think we all have our fixes and vices we use to get through tough times, and smoking happens to be one of the easiest ones to abuse. Luckily for me, I promised myself it would be temporary and was able to keep that promise, but I can understand why some people don't have it quite that easy."

Smoked for about a month (~3-4 cigs/day) following a terrible breakup, and when I told myself I was going to quit, I just... stopped. No cravings, no irritability, nothing. Even when I was smoking, I never got that 'high' feeling; at most I'd have a buzz from actually inhaling the smoke but that was it. Always wonder if maybe I was doing it wrong, but if you're saying the same, I wonder if it is true that some people just don't have the receptor for nicotine or something."

Eventually I call things off myself because I know how unfair the situation is to them, and even then, I'm usually met with 'other girls have told me that before but I thought they were just making it up!', largely due to attitudes like this girl in the post.

CPTSD,feiheyt,t3_ep6gag,1579138597.0,"The 'I'm Baby' meme from awhile back really spoke to me tbh. Your post resonates with me so much though; whenever I think about guys that I've been attracted to, I always fantasize about them holding me, speaking gently, and saying kind and reassuring things. I want my forehead kissed and to be told I'm doing a good job. I want to be assured that I'm safe with them.

I struggle in relationships because when I'm in the mindset of wanting to be Baby, I absolutely cannot stand to be sexualized, as it makes me feel so used and unsafe. Emotional and sexual intimacy go hand in hand, for men especially i think, but I don't know how on earth to even begin to bridge the mental gap I have between them. Without emotional intimacy, however, and without being able to express vulnerability to my partner, sexual encounters feel way too casual and impersonal, and I don't like that either."
CPTSD,feig78u,t3_ep0k4d,1579137785.0,"MAN I envy this. Good on you OP!!! 

Someone being angry at me feels like the end of the world, even when I know it's completely unwarranted and may not even be personal (taking out a bad mood or w/e). I don't know how to explain it, it's not even that I blame myself, it's just an overwhelming feeling of absolute shame. For what, I don't know. It feels agonizing to me, to always be doing my best to be good and kind and do no harm, and for that innocent little girl inside of me to get such harsh words yelled at her anyway.

I think I have it in my head that if I could just be loveable enough, no one would get angry at me any more."

justlegbeardthings,feeyr7u,t1_feewsve,1579044170.0,"It's true. It's really sad that this is the state of things, because it takes away from a human experience that can be pretty amazing.

I'm with you, I hope eventually those women realize how much damage they're doing to themselves and to their relationships by holding onto the attitude that men should automatically know what they want without them having to say or do anything. Sex is an adult activity, and as such, we should all learn to use our adult words on the matter."

justlegbeardthings,feeoqh5,t1_feenj4y,1579038048.0,"I acknowledged multiple times that I'm not a man and therefore can't truly understand. I know these are complicated matters with no real solution. So far, though, I don't see anyone else even trying to brainstorm how to fix the problem instead of simply complaining that it exists.

I more than respect any man's decision  to do what he sees fit in terms of covering his own ass. I can respect something, however, and still not find it sexually attractive in the slightest. No one has to care about that and that's okay. As much as you have the right to ask for explicit consent as often as you like, though, I have the right to lose attraction to someone who does so."
justlegbeardthings,feeo32h,t1_feemmby,1579037669.0,"And in an ideal world, she would have spoken up about it. I know we certainly don't live in an ideal world, but in general it's good practice to speak up if you don't like what's going on."
justlegbeardthings,feel2ny,t1_feej8i3,1579035926.0,"No you're fine, I didn't expect my original comment to be so controversial but maybe I'm not expressing myself well.

I think consent can and should be recognized implicitly rather than explicitly. If in the moment I'm responding positively to what's happening and allowing it to escalate, I'm probably okay with it and if I'm not, I should speak up or otherwise put a stop to what's going on.

In the same vein, when I said the thing about getting it in writing, I didn't mean sending a text that says 'IS IT OKAY IF WE HAVE SEX TONIGHT. IS FORNICATION ACCEPTABLE AND COMFORTABLE TO YOU'. That would turn me off for the same reason, it's too explicit and there's no natural chemistry being allowed to flow.

Something like 'we could go to the movies and then afterwards if you like, back to my place for some wine? üòâ' is flirty and gets the point across, putting the ball in her court to either say 'hell yes' or 'hell no'.

If you aren't dating but maybe talked about a FWB arrangement or similar, a text about if you want to use condoms or not could do the trick; it comes off as a necessary logistical discussion but also gets into writing that the intent to have sex was there from the start.

I know none of these are perfect, and since I'm not a man myself, maybe I can't truly appreciate the situation they're in. My only point was that I'd rather be asked for and give consent in a way that allows chemistry and attraction to flow naturally, rather than having it turn into something that can come off almost transactional. Easier said than done, I'm sure, and I'd never blame a man for wanting to cover his own ass, but sexuality doesn't often respond to what's logical."
justlegbeardthings,feehufw,t1_feegh6x,1579034053.0,"I get it, and it's unfortunate that it's how the world is now. If we're to a point where sex is even possibly going to happen, we both know the attraction is there anyway. If I don't want sex, I should be able to use my adult words and say so. I know it's not always that simple and for plenty of men the risk is simply too high, but I also can't help it if being asked for consent over and over would turn me off so much that I'd probably lose attraction to the person entirely. Lose lose situation.

Realistically, I think the only way to mitigate some of the risk is to wait until you've developed some kind of a relationship with the person (not necessarily a romantic one) and to try to get in writing that she's okay with it happening/maybe that she enjoyed it afterwards. I know it's not perfect, but maybe it's something."
justlegbeardthings,feeg5a2,t3_eooavd,1579033072.0,"I agree with her though, and I don't think I'm alone in that at all. ""Can I kiss you?"" might be sweet the very first time. ""Are you ok/good/ready?"" right before he puts it in could be appreciated, again if it's a new partner. If he asked me every single step of the way though (can I kiss your neck? Can I touch your chest? Can I take your socks off??) that would about drive me nuts.

I'm attracted to confidence and a little bit of aggression in the bedroom. Asking for verbal consent literally every step of the way would feel more like a kid asking for candy than a grown man I've already displayed attraction to.

Edit: to make this very very clear, I am not happy that this is the state of things, for men, for women, for our culture as a whole. I acknowledge that this is a complicated and divisive issue with no real solution and that I cannot truly internalize the fear of false accusations. I understand why things are the way they are, and believe that everyone is suffering from the current believe women/me too/all men are rapists culture, both as an individual and as a society. I do not judge the men who wish to protect themselves, nor would I expect someone to go out of their comfort zone for the sake of my enjoyment.

I was also referring in my original comment only to the men who feel the need to ask for consent at literally every step of the process, amounting to being asked near constantly, several dozen times in like a 20 minute encounter. Once or twice doesn't bother me at all. Again, if someone needs to ask over and over to be comfortable engaging in sex, they have every right to do so - I just don't want to be part of that myself."

Tinder,fdy9g9u,t1_fdw9ri4,1578777425.0,"I'm also a chick that lifts on Tinder, and I agree with you that it's pretty important to make it clear that I'm serious about it from the get go. I don't go posting my totals on my profile or anything, but I include a picture or two of me moving some visibly heavy weights, nothing truly elite but it's obvious I've put a lot of blood sweat and tears in to get where I am.

I find that on the one hand, it does eliminate those who would be overly insecure about it like you said, but on the other, sometimes the matches i get make me feel... almost fetishized? for my strength, and certainly for the aesthetic of the 'fit chick'. It's usually guys who don't hit the gym themselves, which makes me feel doubly objectified, as though I'm expected to maintain high levels of strength and physique while they do... nothing. It comes off less with these guys that athletic/muscular body types are a preference to them, and more like they want it to extend to the entire relationship, where I'll be the strong/dominant partner and they don't really have to put in any work themselves.

Just my experience though. I'd love to hear if any other girls have had similar (or very different!) experiences."
