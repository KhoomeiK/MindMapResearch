You don't have any principles. You're just like the average morally ambiguous person that accepts whatever they're told until it starts to slightly inconvenience them. This isn't something to show off, hell I'd be fucking ashamed."

If she says no, I'll stop.

  


I'm going to fuck this girl if she agrees beforehand

If she doesn't agree I won't do it.

  


Do you still not see the difference?"
todayilearned,felo0c0,t1_felmu83,1579226754.0,"I don't particularly care if you're not sorry, but I don't believe it is right to do something to someone's corpse that they hadn't consented to beforehand.

  


And wether a life will be saved or not is actually irrelevant, because the act of taking the organs of a corpse that hasn't consented is either inheritantly morally permissable or inheritantly evil.

Wether a life was saved or not after the fact is irrelevant.

  


Suppose for a second, that we decide it is morally permissable to take organs from a corpse that hasn't consented, however due to some unforeseen medical complication with the organ, transplanting the organ has managed to kill the living patient in need of the organ.

The consequence of our actions has killed the patient. Does that mean that the act of taking the organ is retroactively evil?

No, because the consequences of the action has no bearing on the morality of it.

  


So arguing that the consequences of taking organs from corpses that haven't consented is beneficial to society has no bearing to this discussion."

The default isn't 

""I get to do whatever the fuck I want to your body unless you say no""

 it's ""I can do whatever you let me do to you (within reason)"""
