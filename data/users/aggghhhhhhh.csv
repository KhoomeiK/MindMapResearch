depression,fdkwneu,t3_elx3gw,1578512689.0,"Hey buddy, first of all I wanna say that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you even tho you may disagree or not feel like that now. Things that are bothering you will go away with time. It is okay to have a bad memory and to be bald. It is okay to get bad grades and not have a girlfriend. It is okay to be autistic. It really is okay to not be okay. Everything that's making you want to take your life is not worth it. There's absolutely nothing in this fucking world that's worth sacrificing your life for. You need to be there for yourself, because no one else will. It is very easy to take your life but to live it is so hard. I read somewhere "" I love you so much I'd die for you, but I would'nt live for you"" Everyone will forget about you someday and you're just gonna be taking your beautiful future that awaits you. It's honestly not worth it. Sure, life fucking sucks and it's really hard but you made through all that and you will make it through this as well. It doesn't get any worse than wanting to take your life away. It only gets better from here. Trust me. I want you to be there for yourself, even if no one will, okay? You may not know it but you're so strong. Idk if you believe in God but have faith, have hope. Atleast in yourself. The whole world exists because of hope. I hope you don't do anything to yourself and all the things that are bothering you will be very irrelevant one day. I promise you. You'll be okay.
Take care. We're all here for you. 
Promise me you'll be okay?"
depression,fdkd1yr,t3_elt686,1578501304.0,"hey buddy I'm really sorry about whatever is happening that is causing you to feel this way. I have no idea what you're going thru or what led to this but I will say this. 

It doesn't get any worse than this. 
wanting to take your life away is as bad as it's gonna get, everything else is just gonna get better from here. Trust me.

I want you to be hopeful even tho that seems like the most impossible thing right now. Idk if you believe in God but have faith, atleast in yourself. 
You're so strong. You survived all that. 
I hope all your dreams come true and you get whatever you want. 
It's hard but be patient. It will get better. 
I hope you're talking to someone about this , if not try therapy. It will really help
I'm here for you. 
Please don't attempt taking your life again. Please. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Get help. Take care :)"

You can get a new girl friend and best friend and I'm sure your family loves you they're probably just bad at expressing it.
I get it. You're exhausted. And it's okay. 
Just give yourself sometime. Take a minute.
Acknowledge the fact that you're unhappy and it will be alright. I know everyone says it gets better but it never fucking ends, does it? Idk if this helped but just know you're not alone. 
Take care :) 
And try sleeping, think of everything that makes you happy"

depression,fcxzmnp,t3_ejh4b2,1578072686.0,She can't force you. You need to be vocal about your opinions and if you decide you're not going. You're not fkn going. No matter what.

It is completely your choice. You decide where you go and where you don't and you don't have to go along with her if you don't want to. She's not respecting your choices man"
depression,fcxtwre,t1_fcxt0k6,1578070399.0,She needs to understand that everything you feel is not you being stubborn. It's a fucking problem you don't control. She atleast needs to respect your issues if she's not helping you with them. She sounds really toxic. Making fun of your problems is fkn unreal. Ofcourse you would be hurt. It's human. Everything you're feeling right now is totally normal. You need to do something about her. Just because she's the only one in your life doesn't give her a hall pass to treat you like shit. That's unacceptable
depression,fcxsg1p,t3_ejh4b2,1578069785.0,I understand you don't want to lose her but if y'all don't communicate openly how is she gonna know that you feel this way. Maybe she's not even aware of her behaviour. Just have a polite conversation and then see what she says?
depression,fcxrnto,t3_ejh4b2,1578069521.0,"I'm sorry if I misinterpreted things man.

I'm sure your sister loves you and if anything you guys will be closer since y'all will be apart. Try not thinking so much about when she leaves and enjoy the days you have with her now. I feel so bad for you. You're just a kid, you don't deserve this :(

depression,fcwo3hu,t3_ej9m5d,1578031265.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss and everything you've been through. It's very heartbreaking. 

I would'nt say I understand how you feel. It may not seem like it now but life is very very interesting and full of experiences. I know you've probably heard this alot but trust me you will be okay. I understand your dad helped you through everything. Your dad would've loved to seen you grow up. It's really upsetting how all this happened. But take your time to accept what has happened. Grieve. It is okay to not feel okay. It really is. 

I don't know if you're religious or believe in God but if you do maybe you could pray for him? Look back at all the happy moments you had with him and don't forget them. Don't forget how he looked or how his voice sounded. Visit his grave as much as you want. And take care of your mother, she lost her better half. She must be shattered

Your father passed away a fighter do that's something to remember him from. 

See another therapist, talking to someone will help even if it's a friend.
Please take care. 
You will be okay."

depression,fcvars3,t3_ej3nw8,1577998197.0,"I'm so sorry you have so much going on. I really am. Your mum would love to see her grandchildren grow up and play in her backyard, she'd love to be their grandma. But she's helpless, her body is killing her.
She's probably really worried about you as you have no parent figures. You need to let her know that she's not alone in this. Don't ever let her feel like she's alone. You have to be strong, for her. I know this is heartbreaking I can't even imagine the pain you'll must be going through. You cannot breakdown in front of her. You have to be her strength. You have to take care of her. And remind her every fucking second how much you love her and that you will be okay even if in reality you can't function. It's easier to think in a pessimistic way. Believe me. You can't lose hope. Nor can you let her. Every second is so precious right now. Please do everything your heart desires with her. Don't have any regrets. You are so strong. And your mother is a fucking superhero to be a single mum and to have cancer and beat it's ass in the futute.  you will get through this. Just be there with her. All the time. I hope she feels better and I hope you take good care of her. And yourself. I'm here if you wanna talk.

Let yourself grieve. Take your time. I'm sure your mum is looking you from heaven above with a happy face but she wouldn't want you to blame yourself or anyone else. Sure, things can have consequences. But I wouldnt blame anyone. It's not even your mum's fault. Sometimes things just happen and it's nobodies fault. And you don't always need someome to blame. I know everyone says things to make you and your family feel better. Believe me she is in a better place. I promise you. Ofcourse you're gonna blame yourself, cause that's the easy way out. To have someone to blame, someone at fault. I think therapy would really help. Or maybe talking to your family or your best friend. Also all of us are here for you. I hope you feel better. You are strong. You made it through that. You survived this. Don't forget to give yourself credit for that.
Take care :) I'm right her if you wanna talk."
