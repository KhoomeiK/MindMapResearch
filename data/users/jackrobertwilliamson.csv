starcitizen,ffmvs4k,t1_ffmvahs,1580059436.0,I'm proposing they fully stop developing the PU so they can focus 100% on S42.  A bit different from the way things are currently.
starcitizen,ffmsskd,t1_ffmrsjf,1580058539.0,"Yea, that is true.  What I'm saying that they should do that even more, and delay the release of 4.1 and beyond till after S42 is done.  This would allow them to focus their full attention to the game, rather than dividing it between two, which is clearly causing the development of both to suffer to a certain degree."
starcitizen,ffmr6kv,t1_ffmptjt,1580058052.0,"I said 4.0 because they have already invested a lot of work on orison, so they may as well release it.  Plus, the completion of the Stanton system seems like a good stopping point."

BackToCollege,ffg4rz7,t3_etfja7,1579898448.0,"I'm not sure if all cc's are like this, but in my experience, there is no application process to get in, you simply turn in the required documents and enroll in the classes of your choosing.  

In terms of what you need to fill out/turn in, you need to file the FAFSA, which should give you grants and/or loans, usually enough to cover the full cost.  You also need any previous transcripts you plan on applying to your degree or that you need for a prerequisite.  If neither of those apply to any classes you will be taking there, then you don't need to turn in transcripts.  If you do need them, you can usually get them through the school's website, requesting them digitally for a fee.  

If you're still hazy on the process, I would suggest scheduling an appoint with transfer advising, they should be able to walk you through the enrollment process, and also scheduling an appointment with the financial aid department of the school, who should be able to help with the funding process."
BackToCollege,fffx9h7,t3_etb9hy,1579893807.0,"I was completely terrible at math since middle school.  I grew up with parents who were bad at math and reinforced the same notion in me.  I never wanted to look at a number after I graduated high school, and I failed statistics my senior by sleeping through it.  I wasn't just bad at math, I refused to even try.

Then after shuffling around in different careers for a number of years, I started to realize that I may want to try out science, or maybe even engineering, both of which require some advanced math.  So I decided to see if I could do it.  The way I approached it was assuming I was as dumb as possible, and taking a placement test.  It put me in precalculus, and I started from there.  I worked my way up, acing every math class I took (with the exception of linear algebra, which I got a B in), till today when I'm in differential equations. 

The way I learned was, to put it simply, by putting in the time.  I had previously had a background in music, and I came to view math in the same way I had for music, which is that in order to get good at it, you have to practice...a lot.  You can't expect to learn the piano by sitting in a piano class and listening to a teach talk about technique.  You need to actually put your fingers on the keys and play the piece over and over and over till you eventually master it.  At first you are bad, but the more you do it, the better you get.  Math is exactly the same way.  Going to lectures is not enough, you need to put pencil to paper and do problems on each subject over and over and over again till you master it.  Plain and simple.

In terms of resources I used, I found Professor Leonard on youtube to be tremendously helpful, since he teaches a subject, then gives you a problem you can work on yourself, then he solves it so you can see if/where you messed up.  He also covers all subject in math, from precalc up to differential equations, so it's comprehensive.  Chegg is also useful if you are stuck on a problem in your textbook, to see the step by step solution.

So overall, the steps to take are 1.) Start at your level of competency, 2.) Do practice problems, 3.) Do more practice problems, 4.) Do even more practice problems.  That's really pretty much it.  I truly believe nearly anyone can get good at math if they put in enough time on it."

Seems like folks are jumping to conclusions based solely on one hyphenated word - ""opt-in"".  How it works can vary wildly, and no one has any specifics yet really, so perhaps we should just wait to see how it actually works before we all jump on the hate train?"
New_World_MMO,ffd8v0j,t3_esyylx,1579815696.0,"To give the ending to your story, now that Bill and Jimmy know how the flagging system works, they enjoy the game for many years to come and become the founders of a powerful clan who overtakes many territories and amasses vast amounts of power throughout the land. The end.

See, it's not such a bad system. Yea it takes getting used to.  That's life.  There are many things one has to learn with any new game.  This pvp system is no exception.

On the flip side, let's give another story.  One where New World is open PVP, full stop.  Jimmy starts the game, not realizing the danger he is in.  He goes about his business picking daisies and killing skeletons.  Then someone super powerful comes along and kills him and he loses all the stuff he just collected.  After respawning, he avoids that area, but because it's open PVP, no matter where he goes, it keeps happening.

Frustrated with this, he invites his friend Billy to play, so he has someone to help him.  Billy joins him on his quests and tries his best to help out, but despite their best efforts, they are not strong enough to go against the gankers, and just keep losing.  Frustrated after the 50th gank, Billy quits the game, now mad at Jimmy for making him waste his money on such a poorly balanced game.  Jimmy soon loses interest himself.

See how that works?  You need to have a system to prevent ganking.  We currently know very little about how the opt-in system will actually work, but I think based on the two narratives above, it is a step in the right direction to prevent ganking.  People need to not jump to conclusions before they've actually seen how it works.  Personally, it makes me even more excited for the game, not less."

Dual access coupons are something that could be bought out of game with real money as well, and sold in game for credits.  So it's a win win for those who do have money and those who don't.

PoliticalDiscussion,ffa5tux,t1_ffa2nmh,1579728461.0,"Climate change is one of my top issues as well, I've dedicated my career to it after all as a chemical engineer looking to develop carbon removal technologies.  I think that overall, when you really look into it, Bernie and Warren are pretty indistinguishable on the issues you mentioned, perhaps with the exception of alternative medicine.  Warren supports GMO labeling, and she is generally hesitant on Nuclear, recently saying that she wants no new plants built and that she wants to phase it out eventually, and saying in 2012 that she flat out does not support it at all.  On the whole though, they're both much more bold on the issue of climate change than any other candidates, with the exception of nuclear, which most on the left are weak on.  So again, you need to look at other factors, like their potential to win the election and what they will do and how they will act if/when they're elected.  I think Bernie is much stronger and less willing to compromise with watered down legislation than someone like Warren would be."
PoliticalDiscussion,ffa1qye,t1_ffa0dni,1579726139.0,"Fair enough.  I personally support Bernie because he has been so strong and consistent on so many issues.  The issues you list are not at the fore front of the issues he has been putting forward over the years, so it doesn't concern me very much.  I trust him the most to stick to his word overall on what he is saying, compared to Warren and Buttigieg.  Buttigieg in particular I don't trust, given that he has a very short political career, and is extremely condescending towards the ideas that Bernie is proposing.  I think Warren could be a good second choice for me, but I think she has terrible political instincts, and would lose to Trump, given that she seems to feel the need to play his game.  I was supporting her initially, and even donated to her, but I think that she is not as strong of a candidate as Bernie.  I'm not a single issue voter, and all things considered, I just think Bernie is the strongest and most consistent of the bunch."
PoliticalDiscussion,ff9ybuy,t1_ff9wmie,1579724137.0,"I don't think the GMO labeling thing is as big of a deal as you think it is.  There are FDA requirements for juice, with the % of real juice being required by law.  There is no health benefit one way or the other to what percentage of juice you drink, so the regulation seems pretty arbitrary, but it is what it is.  Same goes for GMO's.  It's just something some people want to know, and knowledge is power.  I am well aware of the benefits and potential of GMOs, and the backlash that has occurred around them.  I used to be opposed to them previously, because I bought into the anti-science bs that was being put out there, but over time, as I learned more and tried to read objectively, I learned the arguments in favor of them, and that there was really no harm inherent to the technology itself.  This is coming from someone who is very conscious of my health, and the environment.  I think that the propaganda and fear that was being perpetuated 5-10 years ago has waned quite a bit as people look into the science behind it, and as a result, I don't think that labeling would really have much of an effect on people's perceptions of GMOs overall.  Some vegan companies even proudly put on their products that it was made with GMOs.  So I think the dialogue on the subject has progressed quite a bit.

&#x200B;

Regarding alternative medicine, I think it just comes down to giving people a choice.  People should be free to choose whatever treatment they want, including praying to the rain if that's what floats their boat.  Yes a lot of it is snake oil, but if that's what people want to use, then they should be entitled to it.  I agree it is a bit of ignorance on his part, due to him basically being a former hippie. Again, it's not a huge part of his platform, and I think he will likely defer to the experts when the time comes.

&#x200B;

I very much agree on the nuclear thing, but it's hard to find a progressive that does support nuclear, so it's kind of a trade off you have to make.  The closest is likely Yang, but he doesn't stand a chance at all.  So you kind of have to take the good with the bad, and hope that he can be talked into on the bad.  I think with enough scientists sitting him down and showing him the science on the issue, he would have to concede it, and again, I have no doubt that he will put experts in charge when the time comes, so hopefully the experts will be the ones driving the policy."

Second, set up a planning system and block out time to do the work.  I find the Unplanner to be useful for me personally, but any standard planner will work fine.  What I do is write out my class and work schedule for every day of each week at the beginning of that week, and allocate time for doing homework for each class.  That way, when the time comes, you aren't overwhelmed and wondering what part of the mountain of work you should be working on, you've already planned it out ahead of time.  It also lets you see if you have allocated enough time for each class, and adjust accordingly.  The recommendation is 2-3 hours of study/homework per credit, so use that as a basis for your schedule.

Lastly, take a deep breath.  It may seem overwhelming at first, and I felt the same way when I first went back.

TheExpanse,fezjp6f,t1_feze5z4,1579458042.0,"I think there are some trade offs with any adaptation of a book. From what I understand, the interweave some of the novelletes and short stories for some added interest and context, and to keep some of the characters busy when they're not directly involved in the main storyline.  It may not line up exactly with the timeline, as it happens in the books.  Sometimes it works well, sometimes it doesn't.  Overall though, I do think it is effectively done, in a way that provides for character development and gives a look at a different aspect of the universe, even if it doesn't completely align with the timeline as it happens in the books.  Of course, the characters may be presented in a way that is different from how you personally pictured them, but considering the authors of the books are involved in the production of the show, I think it is likely going to be fairly accurate to how they intended them to be portrayed."

But what gets me about the expanse is how much they stick to realism and let the physics drive the story in many different places.  If other series don't do this, I may not be as impressed with it.  That doesn't make it bad, but it just makes it less compelling in my personal opinion. If other things are your priority, like story telling, that's fine.

They don't defy the no sound in space rule, they usually have comms, and if comms go down, intentionally or unintentionally, they are shown touching helmets, which would transmit their voices to each other by vibrations.  Being in zero g in a space ship with atmosphere would still allow for transmission of sound.  It's only when there is no atmosphere that it's an issue.

You could feasibly be in open space for 15 minutes without permanent injury, so it is not unrealistic to just hold your breath for a short time.

TheExpanse,feudowt,t1_feud4ju,1579385589.0,"It has nothing to do with consistency, it has to do with realism.  This level of realism affects the story line, in how the ships are designed, what they can and can't do, how wounds heal or don't in zero g, what decisions and actions must be taken as a result, etc.  This is all based on real world physics, and as a result, makes a lot of the story line highly dependent on things that could actually happen.  This is why I like it.  It's not because it is consistent, it is because it is realistic."

TheExpanse,feu9fzw,t1_feu7cam,1579384429.0,"I mean, you're honestly the one nitpicking here at this point.  Is fusion based propulsion theoretically possible?  Yes.  Could it be done in the way it is depicted in the expanse?  Maybe, maybe not.  Is it more realistic than most other ""sci-fi"" depictions of thrust out there?  Undoubtedly.  And that's the main point here.  Not whether it is 100% completely scientifically accurate, since after all, it's based on tech that does not actually exist yet, and the details of which we are not yet sure.  If we were sure of those details, it would be science fact, not science fiction.  The point is that it is at least theoretically possible, given what we understand about the laws of physics, and depicted in a way that is as true to those laws as possible, while still making for interesting and exciting television.  To me, that's incredibly compelling, and what I find so interesting about the show, compared to others that take a more lax approach to what is scientifically possible."
TheExpanse,feu66h6,t1_fetyc9j,1579383472.0,"You keep focusing on the one exception to realism in the whole show, which I have already said was not realistic, and given a possible explanation to.  That is the single thing in the show that is not realistic.  Everything else is.  That's the point.

Regarding the fusion engine temperature, the way fusion reactors are intended to work, they are going to need to have some kind of magnetic shielding to deal with the high temperatures.  I'm sure that 300 years after we've mastered it, we will have solved the temperature issues.  It is not unrealistic to think.  They also didn't specify the exact amount of fuel used, and we don't know what kind of fuel it is in any case, nor how it is burned, which could be extremely efficiently.  Overall, it is much more realistic of an engine concept than some magical unobtanium hand wavium that most universes usually use.  They at least try to explain it in a somewhat realistic fashion, even if the tech does not actually exist.  At least it can exist, theoretically.  That's the difference here."
TheExpanse,fetwiow,t1_fetsn62,1579380741.0,"They use it strategically, for the purpose of driving the overarching story line of the show.  It is ""the thing"" that keeps up mystery and brings about twists that you could never see coming.  In any case, it is still quite plausible to think that an alien race that has been around for millions of years has technology like this.  We just don't know.  


The point here though, is that with this single exception, it is still very rigid in it's adherence to science.  From orbital mechanics, to ship designs, to the effects of rapid deceleration, to the effects of low gravity on the long term development and strategies of the human species, to interactions with new alien organisms.  It is all extremely realistic, and no show I am aware of has covered space exploration with this level of realism before."

Regarding your claim that epstein drive is just as implausible as hyperdrive, I disagree.  Epstein drive is simply a fusion reactor that uses close to 100% it's energy for thrust.  That is theoretically possible.  How exactly, we don't know, but the physics is there.  Compare this to hyperspace, which involves entering another dimension where the laws of physics do not exist.  We do have some very basic theories on alternate dimensions, but we do not know that they actually exist, let alone how we might tap into them, and even if we did, there is no evidence that the laws of physics would not apply there.  So one is complete and utter fantasy, whereas the other has at least some basis in science.  Regarding the rings, as I said, that is the one hand wavy thing that exists in the show.  Even so, it is plausible to think that a civilization that has existed for millions of years has this sort of tech, but it's a mystery overall, so there is no need to really critique that one aspect, as I have already conceded that it is hand wavy.  Even with that, the rest of the show is still pretty solidly grounded in science.  Things like hyperdrive and anti-gravity are not.

Regarding something like LOTR, now we're comparing different genres.  Fantasy is inherently full of things that could never exist.  That is what makes it fantasy. However, looking at other genres of \*fiction\*, which is stuff that didn't actually happen, but could plausibly happen, and I would argue that in those cases, the most compelling stories are those that could most realistically happen, especially when you throw the label of ""science"" in front of it.  It should at least attempt to live up to the label.  If something goes full fantasy, like star wars or lotr, that's fine, and they can tell the story in that world, but if something is intended to be realistic, and based in science, then it should stick to it as much as possible, in order to make for the most compelling story.  For me, I'm most compelled  by a sci-fi universe when I could see my great great grand children actually taking part in it. Again, that's just my opinion, you're free to disagree, that my opinion is not meant to measure dicks with anyone, it's just how I feel about the subject."

TheExpanse,fetovit,t1_fet95ml,1579377779.0,"Sure, the story is damn good, but what makes for a compelling story, at least in my opinion, is the plausibility of it.  The fact that we could potentially see a thruster that allows us to unlock the outer planets in a feasible time span, and see the geopolitical consequences of such an expansion play out in a very similar way to how it is portrayed in the expanse, is what makes it compelling.  The ring systems are introduced in a way that makes it completely plausible.  Who knows what a civilization that has been around for millions of  years is capable of.  That may be the only possible way we see other solar systems, short of developing as a civilization for millions of years ourselves.  It's not so much a dick measuring contest, as it is saying that this story is really really compelling, due to how real it is, and that's awesome.  Other universes lack that level of realism, and as a result are less compelling in comparison.  That's not pretentious, it's just an opinion.  Others may disagree, and are free to explain why they disagree, but there's nothing wrong with having an opinion one way or the other."

Gravity drugs allow people to transition from living in space to living on a planet.  Autodoc allows people to quickly recover from grave wounds.  Protomolecule opens up travel to other systems and presents an outside threat.  There is some plausibility behind all of it, even the protomolecule.  Technology we have today would have been considered magic 300 years ago, and who knows what sort of advanced ""physics defying"" technology is out there in civilizations who have been around for millions of years.  As long as they stay in the realm of ""theoretically possible"", with the exception of the protomolecule, I would still consider it hard sci-fi."
TheExpanse,fet2oig,t1_fesz097,1579371286.0,"I mean, technically, it's always been in flux.  Back in the days of the old republic, there was a massive station called the star forge that was similar to what we saw palpatine create in rise of sky walker.  Then with the fall of the jedi, things were much less focused on fighting with the force, and it became an arcane practice to a certain extent.  Some stuff was lost, due to people with certain knowledge dying, and things shifted towards more traditional space combat.  Then Rey learned the force, and given her lineage, and the return of her father, things escalated pretty quickly.  


I don't think the story line of sequels was any better or worse than the original or the prequels.  I think if anything, it just illustrates that there is only so many directions you can take a story in 9 movies.  Not many franchises are able to pull that off, especially if you don't really add anything new or interesting the whole time.  Yea, a little new force magic here, new laser sword types there, someone is someone else's kid, etc, but overall, it's the same story, the same rules, all the way through, and the ending is always so predictable, because they can just use some magical hand wavy solution to the problems they face.  The main issue is not the sequels themselves, but that hand waving is how Star Wars tell theirs stories overall."

This is for exactly the reasons you mentioned, the expanse has shown a type of sci-fi that is completely plausible, something you could see actually happening in several hundred years, due to the realism of the science and physics and ship designs overall.  Compare this to a franchise like star wars, which has laser swords and magic, and it is a totally different genre practically.

I could possibly see an expanse video game taking place 50-100 years before the show/novels take place, well before the protomolecule event and thus without the need to retcon anything or dumb it down.  Mars could be well established and freshly independent from earth, and the belt could still be the wild west, being colonized by the inner planets, with whatever the precursor to the OPA is as a third faction.  I think that would make for a manageable scope for a game, at a particular point in the timeline that provides a lot of potential for interesting gameplay, mining, trading, battle over the new frontier, racing, etc."
