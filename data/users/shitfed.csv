SuicideWatch,fesgk19,t3_eqg8kz,1579364923.0,"This stuff is something I think most people's parents do more occasionally, but yeah I know what it's like to have a parent inconsistently make me feel bad via blaming, uneccessary technicalities, etc. I 'm sorry you're having to feel this way! It really sucks! I will tell you that life is so much more than this especially after you're older no longer have to deal as much with your parents- Please don't seriously consider suicide over issues with your family that I can promise will go away in a short matter of years.

And as for people not caring about your problem, this subreddit is for strangers to support strangers who are feeling suicidal or depressed. Thank you for finding the courage to talk about this with us, that's what we're here for!

I would advise you to do your best to work on processing, and then letting go of your frustration when they make you upset. And when you can, do things that make you feel peaceful and relaxed. Try not to bottle up your feelings 'cause it will make things harder to deal with over time and then you might snap. Be good to yourself."

SuicideWatch,feox8x3,t1_feonsqr,1579307370.0,"I mean, I don't think anything is given to us with an inherent purpose or meaning other than what everyone does with it. Life is life, good or bad.

We take it all together and they emphasize each other. It's weird, and feelings of hopelessness and feelings of fulfillment are both sort of an illusion. When you're in one of them, it always seems like the other thing is eternally out of reach. And both are temporary but in different ways. Like people can define general 'happiness' or 'contentment' however they would like, but straight up joy/excitement are never going to be constant, but they can be very consistent. Sadness/depression can go on for God knows how long before there's a break from it, but with enough, eventually it will kill a person, by suicide or mentally.

You probably can't imagine yourself living happily in the future but I'd bet you've done it before, and if you live to do it again you're gonna blow your own mind that you almost cut the whole thing off."

Please, have care for youself. The way you describe feeling regretful about your life is how other people will feel after this. I know it all hurts, MANY people know how it hurts to feel this way. If you want to feel happy and feel love you will NEVER get the chance. Robbing yourself of it makes you your own worst enemy. You'll never get to where you wanna be. That's the only promise you're making to yourself. Even if you feel like no one in your life cares about you, there are way too many people who completely understand you. Help is around. **Ask for it**. I'm sure you don't really wanna be just another dead body. I hope there's a sliver of something left inside."

You'll be okay someday. I was just crying my little ass off over death, emotional issues, etc and now it's 7:02 AM (I've been up all night, and slept during most of yesterday) I felt like dying as I have for a couple nights, which is really hard to feel when that happens. I just calmed down and feel a lot better now.
Reading posts like yours make a small part of me happy inside just because it's such a great thing that people are willing to talk about it. Seeing things I completely relate to are so consoling. Many times in life, things have to get worse before they get better. I want you to know, as I read this post, I cared. I truly do. I hope you can find a way to live more happily and find people who will really stick with you.
Life is so good when it's not total sh*t. I did the dance with minor depression for at least a few years until an abusive parent left and I left school. I'm not perfect and I'm certainly not happy or productive this week, but it's better and it's so freaking satisfying as I remember I'm not on edge anymore and I feel that I actually have control over my life! It feels beautiful when you finally get the chance to climb out of such a deep hole. You can do your best to problem-solve and be patient. You'll probably thank yourself really hard in the future!

abuse,femetzj,t1_femduys,1579251803.0,"Your parents are allowed to terminate the lease for you. You're an adult though, can you change whether they still have the authority to do that?

If you can't change it, perhaps you could contact the head of the school. I don't know if they would do anything about it, or how the rules for this work, but maybe they would let you book it if you asked them and told them how you were forced to lose the dorm.

Maybe there's other people in town looking for roomates if you're comfortable with it."
abuse,femds5r,t1_femconj,1579250306.0,"If you're determined to get out of there, I guess I would just save up to get my own place if I were you, or get back a dorm somehow if you can.

I don't know if the household is really bad but if you feel extremely smothered or very hurt because of them and they don't care, or you don't feel safe, I think you should make leaving them an important priority.

You can probably find someone at your school who's looking for a roomate. Maybe post something on social media asking for a roomate from the same school.

If you signed up for things you'd want anyways, could they do something to change it themselves?"

It feels gross on some level to them when it's uncomfortable. Also, many girls have genrally more issues with our appearance but still for anyone, it could be a weight thing in their mind a.k.a. yes, ignoring one's appetite, even effectively starving, or being too afraid to tell the waitor this wasn't really what they ordered, or just not being very hungry at typical times.

AskReddit,fem1033,t1_fekmzhv,1579236268.0,"Okay, there's some people responding to this with some \*cough\* \*cough\* **bias** and that is not fun to see of course, so I will say men can be guilty of violating a woman's trust regarding sex life as well, probably not in all the same ways, but it happens. However that isn't your point. I think it can happen that when people share things that should typically be assumed as very private information, someone doesn't think of that first or think of it as that important and so they will have a conversation about it with friends because they didn't see what might've been wrong with talking about it.

Or it seems worth sacrificing privacy because the person needed advice or just wanted to vent talk about how they felt- positively or negatively.

There will always be lots of people on the planet who don't turn out to care about your feelings anyhow, though.

And yeah, people have superiority complexes, including one gender thinking they're superior to another, it's sad. It shouldn't taint how you view the average woman though, but I completely get how it could. Hopefully you have better experiences with them!"

AskReddit,felzokz,t1_fekz1ym,1579235153.0,"First of all, this sounds much more specific to your encounter(s) with women who are like that and it sounds like someone is potentially too neurotic to function. Or-

Generally women tend to act more meticulously than men do but also some people like being busy and doing a lot at once.

Tbh some of us can just \*seem\* to get like a sad empty void from being so unfulfilled, that it's stressful. Not actually that much of a gender-specific thing of course, but for women it definitely may tend to come out in rearranging or cleaning things suddenly and starting new projects that will never get done because it's still not fulfilling or they lost the adrenaline, making all the deadlines much more important than they are, or making 75 857 293 110 plans, planning things with friends just 'cause socially or something, you're supposed to do that and if things are going wrong that's bad but gives us somewhere to misplace or problems or shortcomings. Sad, but can happen.

AskReddit,felxbik,t1_fekwh8c,1579233291.0,"Although I've never had any experience with that thought as my own, or another girl being like that, I can imagine it could be due to people who are just deceptive about how much they actually care about you and deceptive about what love actually is. If you're young and impressionable, you might not realize at the time that you're boyfriend who's so in love with you has no ambition, future plans or is just lazy. Or at any age, there's men who can seem so 'deep' or 'emotional/sensitive' or unlike a typical pretty-boy, that they can sympathize with you and it seems like care that you haven't had from other people. Or being with their rebellious nature can make you feel like you are apart of something special. Or two people like each other a lot and one of them happens to be a 'bad boy'.

We're not leaving yet' and I'm like 'When are we leaving?' and he's like 'in a few minutes' and I literally have nothing to do for x amount of time but sit and use my phone if I feel like it.
