soccer,ff7anl5,t1_ff79sjy,1579644783.0,"Fully agree, this is more on the defenders for not closing.  I don't rate Kepa but saying this one's his fault is absurd.  If it were Ederson or Alison letting that in people wouldn't even mention the keeper."

FantasyPL,ff78y2q,t1_ff780gp,1579643464.0,It's the world where I got rid of him 2 weeks ago
FantasyPL,fetj2jc,t3_eqf9np,1579375958.0,ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??  Scared I was gonna be priced out of Hayden -> Cantwell so burn 4 and Cantwell didn't even return and I even played him over one of only two players on my team who actually bothered to fucking return END ME NOW
FantasyPL,feqqf0q,t1_feqpobg,1579344879.0,"Lunny, but only because he offers more going forwards. Don't expect clean sheets"
FantasyPL,feqq88h,t3_eq2lga,1579344804.0,"Who to bench: Grealish, Maupay or Cantwell??"

FantasyPL,feouq8z,t1_feosof6,1579305858.0,I think the Salah move is good ahead of the double game week
FantasyPL,feoumdq,t3_eq2lga,1579305792.0,"Which 2 to start out of Cantwell (Bou), Grealish (BHA) and Maupay (Avl)?"

(Just think about what happens if a competitor does well)"
todayilearned,fdhrydt,t1_fdhqehg,1578429017.0,"LOL the people buying/selling the stock aren't the ones running the company.  And if the directors are shorting their own stock on inside info then it's fraud.

Short selling simply allows people to say ""I don't think this company is being run well"" in the same way that buying allows people to say ""I think this company *is* being run well""."
todayilearned,fdhpugo,t1_fdhobqf,1578427785.0,But buying creates the same incentive to boost a company.  Why is one ok and the other not?

IAmA,fchevdu,t1_fch0107,1577649847.0,I think it's technically more correct to use 'Close out' instead of 'Close'.  But it's obvious what you mean.
