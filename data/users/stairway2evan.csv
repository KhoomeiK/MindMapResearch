It just seemed a little less out of place in those because you also had things like Frieza/Cell transforming back and forth from their base forms and their final forms.

If you know that something about a person makes them uncomfortable and you continue to do/say it, that’s harassment.  It doesn’t matter much the topic.

It was the finishing point for us, the readers, to show the difference between Sam and Frodo’s experiences.

tolkienfans,ff2do7p,t1_ff2a5p8,1579501910.0,"I’ve posted this before, but here goes: To me, the hobbits’ story was very much inspired by Tolkien’s experiences through the World Wars - fighting in the first and seeing young soldiers going off and returning from the second.  And there were three types who returned to their little towns, so far from the wars of the world: 

The ones who, like Merry and Pippin, grew from their trials and became better people for them.  They came home and showed their scars and continued to do great things.

The ones who, like Frodo, never truly got to come home.  The memories of what they’d done, the pains of what had happened to them, it all meant that home no longer held the comforts it once did, even though they fought to protect it.

And the ones who, like Sam, might never boast about their adventures, yet who was able to bear the hurts and trials and come back with a new appreciation of the place he left to protect.  For after all, why leave your home to fight a war if not to come back to a loving family, and a warm hearth, and a table of good food?  “Well, I’m back.”"

The biggest danger of a bullet is it's ability to penetrate you - it's going so fast with so much energy, that it can tear right through your clothes and skin and hit the stuff inside of you - organs, muscles, bones.  Bad stuff.  Because Kevlar is so tight and so resistant to being stretched or torn, when a bullet hits Kevlar, the energy from that impact is dissipated - it's spread into many, many of those tiny Kevlar fibers, making them stretch slightly.  So ideally enough energy is dissipated that the bullet is stopped completely without penetrating, and any impact you feel is from the material of the vest itself being pushed into your body.  This will mean that the energy hitting over a wider area - so instead of penetrating through you, it'll just ""punch"" you, hopefully leaving nothing worse than a bruise.

Of course, the more powerful the gun, the more energy that's going into that bullet, and heavy-duty calibers can potentially penetrate most protective gear.  But for smaller, more common bullets coming out of your typical handgun, they'll provide a lot of protection."

explainlikeimfive,fensoga,t3_eq532z,1579290125.0,"A lot of studios, Disney, Hanna-Barbera, etc. had to find ways to save money on animation, since it was a slow and expensive medium.  And one of the best ways that they pioneered to save money was to have pre-made backgrounds, that the actual see-through animation cels could be laid over.  So instead of drawing mostly the same background 240 times for a 10 second scene (24 frames per second!), you could keep the background, and just draw Fred Flintstone and any other moving objects 240 times, while the background of his house was one single constant image.  Hell, they had tricks for the characters too - the reason that Fred and Yogi Bear and so many others had collars and ties was so that the head and body could be easily separated.  If Fred Flintstone was standing still and talking, his body could be traced for every frame, while only his head would need to be animated moving.

Anyways, the backgrounds.  The way these were made resulted in the backgrounds being a little less vibrant and colorful than the moving objects, due to the paints used.  So if you needed a character to pull a book off of a bookshelf in a scene, the background would include a bookshelf with one empty space, and the important book would be drawn on the animation cel, along with the characters.  It would be animated still in the empty space for a few frames, then it would move, revealing the empty spot in the shelf. Because it's brighter than the background, it always stands out, and you could pick out which book a character was going to remove if you had a sharp eye."

That's easy: we don't.  We have no way of obtaining information faster than the speed of light, so we cannot have any information about that planet from more recent times.  All we can do is study distant stars and planets to see which ones *might* be candidates for life as we know it.

Of course, even if a crazy advanced alien civilization did develop on that 4-bilion-light-year distant planet, they wouldn't be able to reach us for another 4 billion years, even if they had the ability to travel at the speed of light - as far as we know, at least.

Rennet, gelatin, and leather are made using parts of dead animals, making them a step beyond those other products - animals were killed to provide these.

No complaints about that whatsoever.  But that's not what I was arguing.  I'm arguing that your interpretation that this passage is actually referring to Adam and Eve, rather than referring to ""this is how you should instruct the people in Ephesus to behave when you're running your ministry there"" is flawed.  And it's not ""this is what you shouldn't do"" at least not in contemporaneously - it's literally ""this is exactly what you should do"" and it's spelled out clearly as such.

I'm not equipped to make a certain judgement on the meaning of ""women must be silent"" is, or how a modern-day Christian should apply that to their life, but I can say that it's quite clear that this was an instruction meant for the people of Ephesus in one form or another (like everything else in the Epistle), rather than an instruction meant in a roundabout sense for the long-dead founders of humanity."
clevercomebacks,feei5re,t1_feegbnr,1579034235.0,"It's a little weirder than that, if we're being finicky with the words.  ""Theism"" is about a belief: I do or do not *believe* that a god exists.  But ""gnosticism""  is about knowledge: : I do or do not *know* this to be true.  And we can have beliefs without having absolute knowledge.  I believe that there is life in the universe outside of Earth; whether it's intelligent aliens or microbes on some far-off planet or whatever.  But I have no way of *knowing* that in any way; it's simply a belief informed by my understanding of how freaking big the universe is.  So I'm an ""alienist"", but I'm also agnostic with respect to aliens, because I claim absolute knowledge on that.  I'm gnostic with respect to the existence of the Earth, and myself, and my dogs, because to the extent that it's possible to *know anything*, I know those things to exist.

So agnosticism in religion, in the most literal sense, is ""not knowing"" if a god exists.  And in practice most people are agnostic to some degree, you can be an agnostic theist (I believe in a god but I don't know for a fact 100% that it exists) or an agnostic atheist (I don't believe in any gods, but I can't know 100% that I'm right).  A ""pure agnostic"" would be smack dab in the middle, unable to decide if there is or is not a god and with no knowledge of whether such a god exists.  And a ""gnostic theist"" would be someone who both believes that a god exists and knows for sure that they're correct."

This isn't a flowery bit of poetry telling a story of times long ago; this was at the time a literal letter passing on instructions in the present tense.

So I can't tell you what to and what not to believe, but which of the following is more likely: that in the middle of dozens of bits of teaching and instruction on how to set up his ministry, how to vet his deacons, how to properly treat widows and the elderly, and so on, that he diverges to hide some vague and unrelated story *disguised* as literal instructions for the ministry, taking on a charge of sexism that wouldn't actually arise for literal centuries.... or that he was simply passing on literal instructions and bits of his ""wisdom"", as he's doing for the entire epistle?"
clevercomebacks,feef00k,t1_feecqrq,1579032396.0,"No, this section is addressed to “men everywhere” and to the women as well:

> 11 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 15 But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety. (1 Timothy 2: 8-15, NIV)

These are general guidelines for praying and acting in public for *all people*, plural, not for Adam and Eve.  Eve isn’t mentioned until after as a justification for these rules.  You can argue interpretation of “be quiet” all day, or talk about the situation in Ephesus or the arguable authorship; I’ve seen plenty of apologetics... not that they make the statements much less sexist.

Here's a simple example.  I'm an undercover cop, posing as someone absentminded who leaves his expensive car parked in a sketchy alley, with an expensive phone sitting on the dash.  I park it and go into a nearby store, while other police watch the car or monitor it with GPS.  When someone breaks into the car or tries to steal it, they can catch the criminal in the act.  

Same deal with something like drugs.  Send in someone posing as a buyer, and once it's clear that the suspect has possession of drugs or completes the sale, they pounce and arrest the suspect.  Same principle could apply to prostitution, or child pornography, or any other illegal sale.

The important thing about police stings (where they're legal to perform) is that they avoid *entrapment*, which is inducing someone to commit a crime that they otherwise wouldn't have committed.  Like for example, if I threatened you into buying drugs, like ""buy me $1,000 worth of meth or I'll kill your family"", and then my police friends arrested you in a sting. That would be entrapment, because you ordinarily wouldn't have bought those drugs.

explainlikeimfive,fe6332n,t3_enx7fz,1578880686.0,"It’s a holdover from old laws surrounding trading stamps - which were an early version of reward/loyalty points for retail stores.  Spend a certain amount of money and you get a stamp, and collect enough stamps and you could redeem them for some prizes.   A pair of pants, set of knives, household stuff mostly.

A bunch of states didn’t like that idea, because it basically meant that customers were spending more on each item they bought so that eventually they could win a cooking pot, or a decorative vase, or whatever.  So there were laws passed in various states that the stamps had to be redeemable for cash, as an alternative to prizes.  Of course, the stamp-redemption companies didn’t want to hand out cash, so they set a stupidly low value for stamps to cash - say 1000 stamps for a dollar.  They were technically in compliance with the laws, and nobody was wasting their time turning their stamps in for cash when they could just get a household item instead.

So when coupons started being offered, the same sorts of laws applied to them, even though they’re sort of the opposite of redemption stamps.  So to fit in with those weird laws, they put a stupidly low cash value on their stamps.  Take 1000 coupons to your local grocery store and they’ll be obligated to give you a dollar (or whatever the math ends up being), but the paper is probably worth more than that in recycling value alone, even if you didn’t want to actually use a coupon."

Polls are not facts, they're tools, and there's an issue with your methodology here... As well as Pew's, measuring an obviously biased question rather than finding a neutral way to phrase  it.  Which to be fair, they've been accused of plenty of times before. But my issues with Pew are beside the point, again.

Let's say I grant that you're right, and the suit scandal is 100% political in nature, and not racial.  The fact is, we picked the stupidest example because that was part of the point.  How do you explain the Birther movement?  How do you explain ""Obama is the antichrist?""  Or ""Obama is a secret Muslim?""  How do you explain the ""terrorist fist jab?""  Or the outrage over a bust of Churchill being swapped out of the Oval Office for one of MLK?  Or any of a dozen other minor ""scandals"" that we can take at face value as ""political, because people are heated!"" Or we can accept that when you aggregate them, there's a clear pattern here that isn't present with similarly politically-charged figures (and hell, some were just overtly racist).  Nobody's questioning Bernie's birth certificate.  Nobody's questioning Mitch McConnell's religious beliefs.  Ted Cruz was literally born in Canada, making the question of his eligibility far more reasonably debatable than that of Obama (and for the record, he was perfectly eligible, but it's still a situation that we hadn't run into prior), and yet the question of his citizenship barely occupied headlines even as various legal proceedings took place.

We can't just explain all of this away because the idea of racism existing and festering makes us uncomfortable.  We can't just pick the dumbest possible example and claim that there's clearly no problem.

>Turning things back to the royals, I think this is a tabloid media driven problem. Very few people actually have a problem with Markle.

Who is clicking on things and reading them, being influenced by them?  Who is lending their support by clicking on the things that they want to read?  Thousands and millions of *people*.  The media is made up of people expressing their opinions, and is consumed by people who by-and-large agree with those opinions, or at least have the potential to be swayed by them.  If the root issue of racism wasn't a factor, then these clickbaity headlines couldn't exist, because they wouldn't drive viewers and readers.

Because quite frankly, if the conversation were productive, if it was being understood and properly responded to, statements like ""I haven’t heard one actual person levy a racial criticism of Markle."" and ""how you can justify “I know what this person is thinking” just because they criticize a suit"" are completely out of whack with the actual thesis of what the other person is saying.  At least without serious further justification to show why they're relevant.  Absent that, those are absolute strawmen that show unwillingness to engage with the actual points I'm making.  And I'm way too used to seeing those from people who aren't interesting in trying to have a good-faith discussion about these sorts of issues.

Yeah, linking graphs about *Congressional voting records* tells us nothing about the actual public and their polarization.  My parents *hated* Ronald Reagan with the same level of political ire that I see people have for Obama, Trump, or McConnell, or Hillary, or AOC today.  And like all of those, there is a mixture of fair and unfair reasons for any of it.  I'm not saying that the parties haven't moved farther apart, I'm saying that people largely stay the same as a trend.  And even if the public is more split than ever, that doesn't mean there weren't plenty of extreme people in the 80's looking for a reason to hate a politician.  My parents found plenty of stupid things to hold against Ronald Reagan and the Bushes (along with plenty of fair things, don't get me wrong), but that doesn't make them reasonable - and if they held a tan suit against him I'd have to call them out on that because it's meaningless.  What's important is being able to recognize those biases.

Because that's the stuff that people *know* they're not allowed to say in public, unless they're among only like-minded friends.  It's the other stuff, the stuff that is fueled by a racial bias but isn't overt, that people in this thread are pointing out.

Again, you're picking out ""they have to call her black or it's not racism"" here.  None of the people criticizing her are saying ""she's black therefore bad.""

Okay, you're really getting fixated on this instead of actually focusing on the issue.  But I'll reiterate what I'm saying and we'll move on from it, because as much as you're claiming not to be obtuse, this is feeling very obtuse.  Donald Trump bragged about planning the burger thing.  I doubt he was 100% in charge of it, but he certainly was involved and likely shot down other ideas.  He claimed that the money came out of his own pocket since his staff was furloughed during the government shutdown, he claimed that he ""would think that it's their favorite food,"" and ""We have some very large people that like eating. So I think we’re going to have a little fun.""  His spokespeople claimed that he set the menu.  This was a sincere and direct choice.

Let's go back to tan suits again.  A quick Google search shows [Ronald Reagan wearing a tan suit while meeting foreign representatives.](https://twitter.com/keithcowing/status/505550481545256960)  Here's Bush Sr. [wearing one while presenting a military award.](https://thedailybanter.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_400/MTM2NjQ1MDM4NDMyNzI0NTc1/bush41tansuit.jpg)  Here's Bill Clinton [speaking publicly in a tan suit.](https://thedailybanter.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_239/MTM2NjQ1MDM4Njk5ODQ5MzEx/clinton_tansuit.jpg) (EDIT: Looking at Clinton, this could be post-Presidency, I'm not sure.  Point stands, this is a formal appearance as a public figure) There are plenty of other examples. If a tan suit is too casual or festive for a working President to wear, where was the outrage in these situations?  Obama's incident was during one press conference that I know of.  Not a diplomatic event, not a formal event, one single televised press conference, no more formal than any of these situations.  So we can conclude that one President received a much larger amount of negative press and ill will for doing the exact same thing as others across both political parties. So instead of playing Devil's advocate here and googling when someone should or shouldn't wear tan suits, try to spot the difference between these situations.  That's why this isn't comparable to the fast food thing.  We have numerous points of comparison to show that this wasn't an occurrence where criticism was justified, or even where it existed.  We don't have a similar situation with the burgers, but oh boy if our next President pulls that, regardless of party, race, gender, etc., I have no doubt the reaction will be similar.

>I’m trying to find out why the default assumption is race

This is where you're missing my argument completely.  I've never said that it's a default assumption.  I've said that it's an assumption that should only be made if a specific situation arises: a public figure is being criticized for something that other people in a similar position have not been criticized for in a similar way.  AND once other likely factors are eliminated.  This is not a default position, this is a reasoned conclusion.  Jumping straight to ""You didn't like her dress, therefore racist"" would be a default assumption; this would be incorrect and unreasonable.

Kate Middleton (now Duchess of Cambridge if we're being proper) got plenty of press for the times that she missed some bit of royal decorum or went against the norm, and in many ways that's comparable to some of the criticisms and press that Meaghan Markle has received.  But the degree to which it's occurring now and the minutiae that people are focusing on in the latter's case is more radical and more intense than it has been in situations of past royal marriages.  It would be ignorant not to consider and analyze race as a factor, once we've made that comparison and judged there to be a noticable difference, particularly when we're talking about opinions that are being expressed by older and less racially sensitive people."

A tan suit speaks nothing about the actual issues with Obama's presidency.  The burger thing was not the biggest thing in the world, and it didn't deserve the press it got, but the way that a traditional White House event is hosted is a whole 'nother level of issue compared to a choice in suit or a choice of mustard.  They're not comparable.  EDIT: and most importantly, anyone would have gotten flak for the burger issue, while nobody else got flak for the tan suit.  That’s the important thing here.

And as I've intimated in my other comments, you can't *prove* anything is racially biased, any more than you can prove anything going on in a person's head.  I can't *prove* that my wife loves me, because I'm not inside of her brain, but her actions and choices sure do convince me.  All you can do is recognize patterns, and recognize when one person gets more bad press or ill will  than others when doing similar things.  When that's the case, the differences between them are likely the reason for the different treatment, and when the standout difference is race, it's a fair assumption to make.

NoStupidQuestions,fdrxiij,t1_fdrw5ry,1578691262.0,">How is someone able to have a legitimate gripe if you dismiss all criticism as racially based?

Simple.  If someone would have expressed the same gripe about someone of *any* race, it's probably not racially biased.

Your example is a good one.  Trump was criticized for serving burgers to the football team because it sure seemed cheap for someone who has access to all manner of top-tier dining options and who is celebrating some of the most successful young athletes in the country.  Even the optics of it, assuming that the football players just wanted Burger King and whatever, was never going to play out well - there are more interesting ways to give them burgers and still make it seem like a little bit of effort was put in.  I think it was a boneheaded decision, personally.  If Obama had made exactly the same decision, I would have thought it was every bit as stupid.  If Obama had done it, my criticism would have been justified, because I would have felt exactly the same if any other President had made that choice, regardless of race, politics, or whatever.

The tan suit, the Dijon mustard, those were tiny, absolutely inane nitpicks to make of someone when his detractors had nothing more valid to gripe about.  I've seen pictures of most of the last handful of US Presidents wearing tan suits - Bush, Reagan, Clinton, Johnson, (though not Trump as far as I've seen) and not one of them received anywhere near the sort of criticism - in fact, none that I've seen.  The difference can't be politics, because Johnson and Clinton were Democrats.  The difference is race.  And I ain't just talking Fox News, I've had plenty of conversations with (white) family members and friends who have brought up that suit and numerous other teeny tiny issues that don't come up with other people, no matter what side of the aisle they sit.  Everyone has their gripes, and everyone has their biases.  But sometimes we all wear our biases on our sleeves when someone we have a bias against does... well, pretty much anything."

You know how when you go to the doctor for an infection and they prescribe antibiotics, they warn you to take the full dose until it runs out, even after you feel better?  The most important reason for this is to ensure that the bacteria infecting you are really, really dead.  Stop halfway, and the most resistant disease-causing bacteria in your body might survive and keep reproducing.  Now you've got a strain of very antibiotic resistant bacteria in your body, which will require stronger drugs to treat and which will be more dangerous if they infect others - you might have created a ""superbug.""

The same idea applies with animals.  Lots of animals are fed small doses of antibiotics in their feed regularly to prevent them from getting sick in the first place.  Which tends to mean less animals are getting sick and dying early, but also could contribute to the creating of those antibiotic-resistant ""superbugs"" which could eventually cause serious damage to livestock or potentially spread to humans.  This use of antibiotics also reduces the need to provide a safe and healthy living environment for the animals.  If they're less likely to get sick because they're pumped full of antibiotics, you can cram more animals close together in a dirty environment without worrying as much about them all getting ill.

There are other issues outside of the superbug and care issues as well - for example, until recently, certain antibiotics were used to promote growth in animals without needing to use as much feed or as much time.  This has been mostly phased out in many of the biggest producing countries in the past decade or so, however."

The Norse gods were always a little more removed from their domains than the Greek gods - like Poseidon was literally in charge of the entire sea, while Norse sea gods and giants like Aegir and Njord were more casually related to the seas, rather than being in direct and almost total control over them.  And plenty of gods didn't even really have domains in that sense - Baldur is often called the ""god of light,"" but that's more a minor power and a poetic thing than him being like Apollo or Helios and literally being an embodiment of light.  Magni and Modi (strength and courage, roughly in Old Norse) aren't direct analogues of their names either - while Magni is insanely strong, he's not the fount of all strength.  And Modi, as we see, is a coward.

So the Greek gods were simply more in touch with the primal side of their respective elements.  And just as importantly, they were infected by the plagues that had been released from Pandora's Box when Kratos first opened it, so their deaths also released those plagues upon the world, making their deaths even more cataclysmic.  Like Poseidon was infected by rate, and so his death didn't just release the seas, it made the seas insanely violent.  Hermes was infected by pestilence, and so his death created a swarm of locusts to ravage the world.  And so on.

Hence the weirdly specific time measurement that you quoted, or the weirdly specific length of a meter (the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second).  

We could communicate that measurement to aliens and they'd be able to match our units.  If nuclear war destroys most of our civilization and technology, the survivors could still get these precise measurements (eventually). We could write it down and send it across the galaxy in a spaceship, and the humans who colonize some distant world would be able to use it accurately. This kind of stuff is thinking way off into the realms of possibility, but that's the reason for using a universal standard: for when it eventually, way off in the distance, becomes useful."

It's basically just a clump of irregular cells that usually aren't harming your body (though there are harmful exceptions!) but which can sometimes progress to become cancerous.  They can usually be removed by a surgery, since they won't grow back if the mass is removed.

A cancerous or malignant tumor is one that isn't limited like a benign tumor.  It's invading into the neighboring tissue, it's growing at a faster rate, and it has the ability to become malignant and branch off into other parts of the body.  This is typically the dangerous kind that requires more than a simple surgery to remove and attempt to beat."
MurderedByWords,fd7boqj,t1_fd6qcb0,1578202039.0,"You’re correct that “Homo” is the Latin for “man” (as in *Homo sapiens* “wise man”), but that’s not where homophobia traces its roots.

Homo- as a prefix like in the word “homosexual” goes back to the Greek root, not Latin.  And the Greek prefix means “same.” Like in “homophone” (words that sound the same) or “homogenous” (uniform in consistency).  The opposite of “hereto” which means “different.”

Homosexual was based off of that meaning of the prefix “Homo-“ and homophobia as a term was coined in the 60’s by a psychologist based off of the term “homosexual.”  So it has nothing to do with “man,” it just has to do with “the same (sex).”  And nothing to do with journalists for that matter either.  Fear of men would be “Androphobia” from the Greek word for man, “andros.”"

Like let's start out easy: let's say that I work in HR and my boss wants me to hire a new person.  And for the sake of ease, let's say that I make $30 an hour.   I might spend an hour creating the job listing to put online, 3 hours over the next two weeks sorting through the applicants, another hour calling my top 5 options, and then another 3 hours to interview those 5 applicants.  And let's add on another round of interviews between my top 2 choices after that, one hour each.  So if we count that up, I've spent 10 hours, which is $300 bucks that my company has spent on my payroll, and we haven't even staffed the spot yet.  And I've been lowballing these estimates for the sake of ease.

Add to that that there were probably a couple of managers in those interviews with me (who probably make more than what I listed there) along with general company overhead, the money can add up quickly.  

Then even once the person is hired, those managers are devoting hours training them (no matter what the job, training is a process that will usually take weeks to months), double checking their work, and that's time that they're spending not doing their normal workload.  And then there might be additional costs - benefits or perks outside of salary, cost to give the new hire a uniform, required gear or tools, even just a name tag for their desk.  Start adding that stuff up and factor in overhead costs alongside, and it might be a little while until a new employee actually becomes a profitable investment."

Vulgar Latin, on the other hand, includes the versions of the language that were spoken by larger chunks of the population for a larger time, and which eventually began to develop into the modern Romance languages.  Since it was spoken mostly by poorer people across the Empire and throughout the Mediterranean, it was more subject to change and wasn't usually written in a standard way, since the majority of speakers were illiterate."

That being said, we can probably get pretty close, because we have lots of clues.  Like lots of poetry in Latin that tells us which words sound like each other, even if the spelling might tell us otherwise.  Examples of jokes and puns that rely on the pronunciation of words to get their humor.  And of course, a whole bunch of languages that developed from Latin - French, Italian, Romanian, etc - that can help us figure out how the Latin cognates would have sounded.
