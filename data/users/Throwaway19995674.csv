offmychest,fdqfayz,t1_fdqb4zg,1578665196.0,"She did it, she was home alone at the time and when her sister came home she found her. It's not disrespectful to contemplate that, I did too for a minute."
offmychest,fdq6e8j,t1_fdq3465,1578656864.0,"Yes, we have had extra counselors all week including some counselors who used to work at the school who returned for this. It's been a relief to me as I am not trained to speak to kids about this stuff and with it being over suicide I'm honestly terrified to touch on it at all.

You're right, the world is a lot scarier for kids now than it was for us. I had suicidal ideations as a child, but luckily(?) for me the internet was barely just starting and it wasn't as easy as it is now to look up how to do something like that. Now kids are hearing about suicide constantly from TV shows and movies and that ""Momo challenge"""

offmychest,fdq66oc,t1_fdq0lh5,1578656609.0,"I'm so sorry. That situation seems so unfair, and I'm sure you know this but I'll say it anyway... It's not your fault."
offmychest,fdq60xz,t1_fdpoh2n,1578656412.0,"Thank you. I have been trying to make the days ""normal"" as I can while secretly holding back a bit on stuff without them noticing. Two of her best friends are girls I have to yell at nearly every class so I've been trying to sit by them during art without them thinking it's weird.."
offmychest,fdq5tnm,t1_fdppqus,1578656161.0,"It's been very confusing. All of the staff have been trying to think back but she truly was a very happy, smiley kid all of the time. The counselor told me that she looked through notes and had met with her multiple times but never once did she mention being sad about something relating to herself but rather was worried about her classmates. What she did tell me and I agree with is that children can be impulsive, and as we all know don't recognize the weight of their actions. There is no way for a 10 year old to really understand death. The glamorized idea of suicide from TV shows, movies, etc might be in their head where everyone feels sorry for being mean to them after, but they don't really get that they will be dead and gone. She just wanted to escape a moment that was too painful for her for whatever reason, and did that. It shows it was a bit more ""impulsive"" because she hadn't told anyone or written a note and these days kids tell nearly everyone everything over their phones.

The only ""sign"" I noticed was her being a bit more withdrawn and not putting in much effort in art class anymore but that is so so common in 5th graders so it's hard to really think of that as a sign.."
offmychest,fdq597s,t1_fdpxnna,1578655436.0,"I'm glad someone else can relate to this... Sometimes I feel bad about it, but it's not because I don't care, I just don't find myself feeling the sadness others feel unless it is something that happens to me or someone very very close to me."
offmychest,fddh4fu,t1_fdcyp57,1578312031.0,"There are going to be a lot of staff at school tomorrow to help out, and I know the principal and counselor will be in that girls regular classroom to tell the kids she passed away tomorrow. Our administration are being pretty awesome and have said if we need to take a break today to call the office and someone will cover."
offmychest,fddh1s9,t1_fdd3zuu,1578311937.0,"If students are asking me about it I will most likely send them to a counselor who is actually trained to deal with this sort of thing. The students aren't supposed to know why she died, but I feel like they will find out. More than likely she told at least one kid before what she was planning to do."
