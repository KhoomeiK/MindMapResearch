SuicideWatch,ffks34u,t1_ffikhtw,1580027891.0,"Very happy to hear that. I also find that one of the surest paths to happiness is dedicating yourself to helping others. Good luck with your channel, I really hope you are able to help your cause."
SuicideWatch,ffkrtu0,t1_ffipa4b,1580027769.0,"I'm sorry to hear about your family situation, but I'm certain you mean a lot to other people than just your mother. Family is about more than blood, and there are many people to whom you have value besides the ones you share a name with. Even if you don't feel like you have anyone else important in your life at the moment, I guarantee you there are many important relationships in your future if you just hold onto life and try to make new connections.

I can tell you are a good person, cause you clearly care about your mother's well-being, so I'm sure many other people would be lucky to have someone like you in their life. I recommend talking to your mom about your feelings (maybe don't tell her about your suicidal thoughts, just let her know about your feelings), hopefully she will be able to support you through these tough times. 

Besides, you should never forget about the most important person in your life: you.

In any case, I don't mean to shame you for feeling the way you do now, it's natural to feel like that sometimes.

Just know that I'm cheering for you to get better, and I'm not the only one."
SuicideWatch,ffkqinr,t3_etsvym,1580027125.0,"Hey Kris

I understand wanting to be alone, and sometimes it can be healthy to let your feelings out in a private setting, but I also think you should be sharing these feelings with other people.

I don't know much about your situation, but from your description, I can tell that you, at least, have a mom who cares about you, and I'm certain she's not the only one.

People often have a hard time expressing their feelings for one another, so it might seem like nobody cares, but trust me, just because they don't express it well, I promise you mean more to people than you realise. Besides, you shouldn't judge your own value exclusively on other people's perception of you.

It sounds like you are fairly young, and you may not be in the most stable family situation right now, but trust me, things are going to get better as you get older. Yes, you will have moments like this where you feel down, but from someone who has been in those situations many times, it's only temporary.

Once again, I understand the need to process these feelings on your own, but once you feel ready, please go to sleep, and tomorrow you will wake up feeling, at least a little better.

Making this post was a big step towards getting better, and I commend you for it, but the next step is to reach out to your mother, or some of the other people in your life and share your feelings. Also, do not underestimate the impact of seeking professional help if you feel you need it.

Good luck Kris, we are all standing behind you."

If not, she needs professional therapy, cause she clearly needs help sorting out some emotional baggage. Either way, good luck, I don't envy either of you."
