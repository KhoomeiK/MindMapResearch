You're right, I wouldn't have allowed the wish to begin with.  A simple ""That is beyond my power"" from the djinn would have nipped the problem in the bud.  But if you are going to accept it as a valid wish, it should at least achieve what it is intended to do, even if there is some evil genie twist on it.

Good evil genie twists are things that add unintended consequences to an otherwise functional wish.  Bad evil genie twists are ones that remove the intended purpose of a wish due to people easily working around the exact wording of the wish, making it so the wish doesn't change anything and doesn't drive the plot forward in any way."

But if you start going into arguments which are too technically orientated, it starts to break down any immersion in the world.  Presumably both the cleric making the wish and the djinn are gifted with magical knowledge and would craft an effect that meets the common sense interpretation of what ""stopping living things creating undead"" is in their world.

It's the equivalent of somebody trying to argue they didn't murder somebody because it's a gun that killed the victim, not them pulling the trigger.

Not only is that relatively rare, but the information of seeing all enemies is still more than enough benefit.

That is rarely the case against high level players.  But even then, that's still not a reason to try and use zues ult to killsteal.  You're not gaining anything significant, and are going to inefficiently use your damage in the fight trying to killsteal.

If the enemy team is dead, you didn't use your ult as a opener.

> The enemies might have BKB at the start of a fight but not the end of a fight.

Technically yes, but that situation rarely comes up.  Early-mid game only the enemy carry might have a bkb, and it's going to still be an 7-10 second bkb.  Delaying your ult into 10 seconds into the fight to get some damage on the enemy carry is rarely worth it.  And you ideally should have ulted before they bkb'd anyways, if you get in the habit of spamming your ult it wouldn't have even been a problem, it would only be a problem if you are holding off and thinking about when you should use it.

Late game, if they have 2-3 bkbs on the team, maybe you can hold off for a couple seconds.  But because their bkbs are so short duration by this point in the game, they aren't preemptively activating them.  They would be using them strategically, so if you waited that long to ult, you've already failed.

But you reveal where the enemy smoke or invis is.  Often that can mean picking somebody off.

It's the right play 99% of the time, and your brainpower is far better used on more important things in the fight than trying to time an ult for the ultra-rare circumstance you can extract some minor benefit from it.  Just spam your ult at the start and worry about more important things."

It is arbitrary, because it doesn't achieve anything.  There are no password crackers out there that crack two repeated letters in a long password any faster, it's just not a common enough thing for people to do when making passwords except by coincidence.  But what it is doing by enforcing 'no repeated characters' is reducing the number of possible characters by 1 for ^nearly every character in every password on your site, that is a significant difference.  E.g. assume you have a fairly standard 8-character alpha-numeric+simple symbol password, that's about 72 possible characters.  With no arbitrary rules, there's 7.22 * 10^14 possible passwords, by removing every password with repeated characters, now there's 6.54 * 10^14 possible passwords.  You've made every password on your site 10% easier to crack because of your silly rule.  And for what reason?  Not to mention annoy your visitors with yet another red warning to flash in their face because their password didn't meet your arbitrary definition of what a password should look like.

I assume you mean ""since that's not in the specification"" here to make sense with the rest of your comment.  But that is just entirely wrong.  The specification says that you can put a + sign before the @ in an email address, and that's not a new or recent invention, anything before the @ sign is up to the receiving email server to parse as it sees fit so almost every ASCII character is allowed, and gmail happens to make + a control character, but to everything else it's just part of the email address."

It's not their first choice, Google just wants videos that make good ad revenue.  But regardless of what they desire, they currently do act as an automated decision making engine to detect copyright infringement.

> They are just doing strikes in compliance with the DMCA.

We're not talking about DMCA strikes, there are usually very few problems with the actual DMCA process.  The problem is DMCA is a manual process, somebody sends a letter, and Google has to hire somebody to read the letter and enter in the details.  As a tech company at youtube's scale, they want to avoid that (both the process of hiring people, and having videos taken offline are unpalatable), so they give copyright owners a suite of automated tools to manage IP on youtube to try and convince them to not send them DMCA notices, as well as other options to try and keep the video online despite it being possibly infringing.  And to attract those copyright owners into using the system, that system is set up to pretty much exclusively be to the benefit of the copyright claimants, and the very same system that people have issues with on youtube.

By comparison, if you have something you believe to be fair use, in youtube's system somebody can claim infringement and unless you have millions of people knocking down Youtube's door, you are basically shit out of luck and have no recourse, your video is taken offline and you are permanently branded a copyright infringer.

But if you have something you believe to be fair use and receive a DMCA notice, you can file a counter-notice which basically says ""come sue me in court if you want"" and get the video back online, and the claimant has no other options other than to actually sue you, and courts tend to be much fairer at conflict resolution than youtube's system."
