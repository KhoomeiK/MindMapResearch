SouthParkPhone,fe78y4p,t1_fe750wf,1578911606.0,No I don't know it was sarcasm seeing as how this is text so sometimes it is hard to pick up on things like that. I also don't know how the servers work and have only been playing this game for a month or so and haven't visited the sub that often. I just know I played vs 2 people the same day using the same cheat/exploit and I wanted to communicate that I have witnessed it first hand. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Maybe add /s to your sentence if you are scared of people not picking up on sarcasm that may not be so blatant to inexperienced people.

SouthParkPhone,fe6vqv5,t1_fe6k3mi,1578906272.0,I call your explanation of why it can't happen bull shit. I played against 2 different people a few weeks ago that made Big Gay Al go invisible and attack me without being target-able by my spells or other cards. Both players took all 3 of my bars with this 1 invisible guy. Not even dropping poison or using battle cries hit it.

NBA2k,fe6n3c0,t1_fe6mxm4,1578896619.0,Then ask for explanation instead of going off the deep end. I am saying that it isn't unreasonable to miss an open lay up now and then. Especially if other circumstances are at play. But if you are missing 2 wide open layups that were timed good in a row then yea I can understand more why you would want to bitch about it because that is way more ridiculous then just missing 1 every so often that wasn't timed well.
NBA2k,fe6mu8k,t1_fe6mqlj,1578896342.0,Again wrong.

NBA2k,fe6mld1,t1_fe6me21,1578896070.0,"The extra paragraph is the 2nd one. Offensive threats are a fairly wide range of builds. The one I am using for boot camp on Sat has 8 defense badges and he is still heavily offense oriented. I did help you. I gave you the only 3 viable options (manually dodge, get your teammate to pick up coverage, change your badges and/or build) . What the fuck do you want from me? If you are reading this in a negative way it is because you are negative and reading it in your head with the voice YOU made up.  Now I honestly don't give a fuck because your obviously a dick head and a troll that didn't really come for advice and just to bitch. Keep being a shit player then complaining about it."

NBA2k,fe6lzxm,t3_enzzu8,1578895428.0,"This is such a vague question. You can't just ask what is the best build. There is no best build and it is all opinion. What is best for me might not be best for you. You need to at least give us more information relating to your play style if you want suggestions instead of just asking what the best build for a PG or SG is. My personal ""best build"" isn't even an option for my friend and his play style."
NBA2k,fe6ltie,t3_eo02zs,1578895240.0,Doesn't matter to me I only have mine on bronze and I still green most shots. I rather have more in corner specialist because of the insane boost I get from moving mid range jumpers that no one seems to be able to cover.
afkarena,fe6loht,t1_fe6lc76,1578895092.0,Thanks. I will check it out when I get a chance. I didn't think it was possible for me to have corrupt or missing data and still play every day with no other issue. Makes me think this game is pretty easy to hack with no repercussions if it can't sense something is wrong.

NBA2k,fe6lfq2,t1_fe6l6da,1578894842.0,"No for real just move around the screen. IDK what else you are expecting me to say. That is literally your only option and what every one else does. If you aren't capable of doing it then don't chalk it up to me having a bad night. 

On another note. Your build is probably shit if you only got 1 defense badge. My lowest amount of badges on all my builds is 4 and that is on my scoring machine. A build I refuse to play because of it's defense. You will need someone that is going to be on the same page as you and pick up your guy on pick and rolls if you can't deal with it. That person will also have to be ready to drop back and cover their own man because you probably can't on your build. I would also prioritize clamps and intim over pick dodger. They are both much more effective and can even make up for you getting hit with a screen by stopping the drive or making the shot miss."

If you miss 2 really good timed open layups in a row then come talk to me. Until then keep your mouth shut.

NBA2k,fe244lo,t1_fe1tck7,1578834288.0,I have a 99 3 point on my sharp and I don't always make a full white when I am open and don't green. Just seems legit to me that someone with an 80's layup has a chance to miss if their shot isn't even close to fullwhite or  greening.

NBA2k,fe1lkk9,t1_fe1ceon,1578828101.0,I'm not exaggerating. Most shots wouldn't go in with a bar like that unless you had really high stats in that category so why should the layup?  I doubt his layup is at a 95.

Every one shouldn't get a freebie just because they are open. You fuck up your shot then your shot should be fucked. Obviously have more of chance of going in if you are open, but no way in hell should it always go in if that is the way you are shooting. The people that expect this are the same idiots that probably turn their difficulty all the way down on any game they play."
NBA2k,fe13hb7,t3_enlivy,1578822109.0,Possibly. Dead eye is another. The arguments I hear for people not using dead eye is just ridiculous.

CompetitiveTFT,fe0zky5,t3_enkdmb,1578820799.0,Depends on what you pull and how every one else is playing. Don't let these other guys fool you into thinking differently. There is no concrete answer. If you are lucky early and have a good comp that won't require much upgrading you can go for a rush. I had upgraded Kindred after the first carousel  yesterday and said fuck this I'm not rerolling anything until I am 9 because my team was already busted. Absolutely dominated the game. If you aren't getting lucky pulls and every one else is beating you and you are sitting middle or lower end of the pack then you have to upgrade or you are going to be eliminated or damn near close to it by level 8.
