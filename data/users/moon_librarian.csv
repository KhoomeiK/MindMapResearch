selfimprovement,fdiahd9,t3_elbtt2,1578438672.0,"I'm sorry to hear that your year sucked! Mine sucked, too. I also struggled with depression for years. I managed to overcome it eventually. Some things that helped (apart from meds and therapy) were journaling, mindfulness meditation and listening to podcasts.


I've been writing a journal every day for over two years and it's awesome. I'm using an app called Daylio, it's simple and fun to use. 


I use Insight Timer for mindfulness meditation. There are plenty of guided meditations to get you started. You might want to check out meditations on self-compassion; we could all use more of that. You don't need to meditate, you can just listen to them. I do it every day and it's super relaxing.


There are plenty of inspiring podcasts on every topic, including depression, psychology, mental well-being, mindfulness, and so on. Some of my favourites are 10% Happier, Being Well with Dr. Rick Hanson and Wrestling With Depression. I listen to podcasts every day and they really helped me keep my mind from negative thoughts. Take care!"

podcasts,fcvfc4y,t3_eiqxta,1578000910.0,"My favourite podcasts are those where two people just talk about a topic for 90 minutes and the guest is an expert in some field. I've listened to a ton of these episodes and learned a lot from them. I even take notes if the episode is super informative. Here are some of my favourites.

**10% Happier** - Esther Perel (psychotherapist who does couples therapy), James Clear (creating good habits)

**The Psychology Podcast** - Helen Fisher (anthropologist who wrote books about love)

**The Ezra Klein Show** - episodes with Michael Pollan (psychedelics, food, death), Peter Singer (one of the most influential living philosophers, ethics professor), Johann Hari (wrote a book on social causes on depression), Cal Newport (productivity, digital minimalism), Jenny Odell (attention economy)

**The Art of Charm** - Scott Barry Kaufman (PhD who focuses on creativity, intelligence, positive psychology and mating intelligence)

**You Are Not So Smart** - Bruce Hood (talks about how the notion of the 'self' is very likely just an illusion)

**The Tim Ferriss Show** - Cal Fussman (just a super interesting journalist who did a bunch of things)

**Finding Mastery** - Matthew Walker (sleep expert)

**The Science of Success** - Robert Greene (human nature)"
antiwork,fcu36bj,t3_eit43o,1577971169.0,"Minimize your spending as much as possible. Write down every penny you spend. Learn to cook so you don't have to spend too much on food. Don't have children. Try to get enough sleep (8 hours per night is the minimum), drink a lot of water, eat healthy and stay physically active. Practice mindfulness meditation and find hobbies in order to stay sane. Write a diary and listen to inspiring podcasts. Try to find a job that you can do from home. Good luck!"
podcasts,fck498c,t3_ehkv21,1577716137.0,"My favourite is **Wrestling With Depression**. It's hosted by a comedian from Chicago. It's no longer active but there are more than 100 episodes and I've listened to almost all of them, some of them more than once. People seem to enjoy **Mental Illness Happy Hour** but I don't like the host. However, I did like the episode with Chris Gethard. **10% Happier** and **Being Well with Dr. Rick Hanson** are also some of my favourites."
SeriousConversation,fcaug47,t3_egueiv,1577576834.0,"Do you like podcasts? Taking a walk and listening to podcasts is one of my favourite things to do. Check out the Giant Beastcast, it's a great gaming podcast. Also, I really like journaling. Check out Daylio. And if you are into meditation, check out Insight Timer. It has loads of awesome guided meditations. I also like listening to a podcast on meditation and mindfulness, it's called 10% Happier. I hope you feel better soon!"
