My husband and I know each other's phone passwords, and possibly a few passwords otherwise, but we almost never go into each other's phone. If one of us is driving and  gets a text, we'll hand the phone over to check and answer for us. Or if we need to look something up really fast. But even after 15 years together, we still don't go into each other's things without asking. He could go into my purse and wallet if he wanted, I don't care. But he always asks. 

We also don't use each other's computers unless we need something specific on that computer."

RealEstate,ffidask,t3_etslhj,1579971142.0,"Sure.

If you're already decluttered you have a head start. If not, start decluttering NOW.

 I mostly pack with book or file boxes. They stack well and don't get too heavy. Start with things you don't use much. For example, books or out of season clothes or decorative objects. Set a number of boxes you want to do a day, be it  3 or 5 or whatever. It'll depend on how much stuff you have. Clean out your pantry.

Label everything on all sides. You can use color coded tape too, if you want. Some people label them according to the room they'll go in, but I'm not usually that organized. 

If you are going to be packing with a baby, get all the small things done first. You will NOT have time to pack with a newborn and won't want to be lifting really heavy things yourself much. Although if you have a somewhat easier newborn, then it's a bit easier to pack in my experience since they sleep a lot. I tried to pack us to move with a 5 month old and she was at the age where she was old enough to need to be entertained but not old enough to entertain herself.... 

By the end, you should only have necessities -- like your last week of clothes, dishes, etc left. Pack those the night before you move. You can pack a lot of dishes in the week beforehand and eat with disposable stuff if you want too. 

HAND CARRY your pillows, 2-3 changes of clothes for everyone, your bedding, and toiletries on moving day. You won't want to be hunting for that stuff whole exhausted. Hire movers to do the heavy lifting. It is 100% worth every single penny."

namenerds,ffi8d67,t3_etqyra,1579967728.0,"Certainly paying attention to nicknames isn't new. We ruled out SO MANY names (for boys especially) because we (I) hated the nicknames. And we know ourselves. We know they'll get shortened at some point, so we picked a name that we liked in its long and most popular nickname forms. 

So my daughter was almost named Katharina, which is a big mouthful of a name. We also probably would have used Kate as a nickname, but were ok with Katie and Kat too.  Instead, she's Vivian and sometimes called Viv (and my husband swore she'd never be called Vivi, which he broke the day she was born lol but it didn't stick).

On the other hand, names like William or Thomas for boys were ruled out because I liked Tom but not Tommy and Will but not Bill or Billy. Nathaniel was our boy name because we liked Nate."

We replaced all of them (and added a CO2 to my daughter's room) when we bought the house but they're nothing fancy. Need to add another CO2 to the game room, as well. The gas hot water heater is in the crawlspace space behind my daughter's closet (and above the master bath), so that was pretty nonnegotiable to me."

Also, this whole area is a cluster. There's an exit from the freeway not far back, people fly, and you have to get across multiple lanes of traffic to turn right. Right lane is turn only. That overpass also has a cloverleaf entrance to it if you want to head east."
cats,ff3qcjj,t1_ff3lzng,1579546575.0,Same. My biggest fear with fire is that our daughter is upstairs by herself. And then 4 cats. One would definitely hide under the bed. I'm not sure about the other 3.
EosinophilicE,ff3crve,t3_eqspmk,1579538560.0,"So my GI says that what people get stuck most often are meats (especially chicken), rice, and bread. Basically, fibrous, dry food will get stuck on the ridges in your esophagus. And this has proven true for me -- chips also do it. Also, if I take too big a drink of something cold my esophagus will spasm and I have to wait for it to relax.

For me, what's worked has been eating slowly, chewing well, and sitting up straight. Sometimes walking around or stretching my neck. Small sips of a carbonated drink evidently can help too (I haven't tested this though, but I hear it's good in another EOE group I'm in).

We shouldn't HAVE to eat like that, though, if you can get yourself into remission. When things are behaving, I can eat almost normally. I'm on a PPI right now, which helps a lot, but I'm starting eliminations next month to try to figure out the root cause since I'd prefer to not be med dependent.

And absolutely it can be diagnosed as an adult: I'm in my 40s and was diagnosed last year. My reflux has been getting progressively worse over the last year or two, which I suspect was the real start of it getting bad."
AmItheAsshole,ff23oy4,t1_ff1gy8a,1579492946.0,"Right? My 9 year old would never dream of going into a room with a sign that said she couldn't. She wouldn't paint on something that wasn't hers.  She'd ask permission if she really wanted to look.  If she were bored with the video game, she'd come and whine to me about it."

We lost the last dog at 14 in 2017. We needed a break. Dogs are great but cats fit our lifestyle a whole lot better at this point.  And my mother on law is heavily involved in rescue. At any moment there are at least 10 dogs at her house. I know where to go for my fix."

We adopted a set of 8 week old brothers in 2015 and they're fabulous cats who love each other very much."
MergeDragons,fc7cy8g,t3_egc6y2,1577503780.0,She's giving me that ridiculous 4 hills for 1 egg trade right now. Just no.
BeautyBoxes,fc69ro2,t1_fc5qe33,1577475548.0,"Mine is all stashed under my sink. It's ridiculus. I took it out and organized it a month or two ago, I need to organize again so I know what I might actually might need soon now that I've cut a few subs. Plus, my cats opened the cabinet and knocked everything over."

Although given I'm planning on starting an eleimination diet soon and cutting milk, this will hopefully help (I suspect dairy will need to go permanently)"
BeautyBoxes,fc69ak9,t3_eg6ac9,1577475231.0,"I cancelled Ipsy, Allure, and GBP too. I pulled a few items out of my stash and brought them to Christmas with my husband's family and told my mother-in-law and sister-in-law that they were welcome to whatever they wanted... they split all of it up! 

I only have FFF left, through the Spring.

Of course, here I am shopping the edit sale and looking at skincare but I need to go down and stare at my stash again."
