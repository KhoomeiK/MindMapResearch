""Hey mom remember that time you found me in the bathtub covered in spaghetti noodles? Acid."" Every time she freaks out in the most mom way possible. ""Smashcola Lastname, you did not do acid on high school!!!"" ""Uh yeah I did. Ground me!!"" Then she rolls her eyes, calls me a little shit, and laughs. I'm sure our parents knew a little bit of what we were up to, but they definitely didn't have a clue about the majority or else they never would've let us out of our rooms, and our Christmas Confessions wouldn't be nearly as entertaining."

aww,fetb8pf,t3_eqh7yt,1579373569.0,"I used to have a chinchilla and although she was truly the most adorable creature in the world, she was also the most demanding, bossy little floof ever. Those precious tiny hands are capable of grabbing onto the bars of the cage and rattling the whole damn thing like a little criminal in a miniature jail cell begging to be released. She would loudly stomp around and make as much noise possible so I would know it was playtime RIGHT FUCKING NOW. She chewed everything within reach: baseboards, cables, cords, cardboard, cabinets, furniture legs, you name it. Then when it was time to go back to her enclosure, all hell broke loose. If a chinchilla doesn't wanna be caught, they WILL NOT BE CAUGHT. You might even have the damn thing in your hands, and then POOF! They do something called ""fur slip"" and you're left with a hand full of fuzz and no chinchilla. I'd have to bribe her with a dust bath and a raisin, and even that didn't always work if she wasn't done tearing through the house and ninja kicking off the walls. That's not am exaggeration. They literally bounce off the walls. My ex got her when we split up, so I hope she's still alive and well, leaving little chinchilla turds and bite marks all over his house."

I work long hours and by midday my meds are wearing off, so my doctor prescribed 30mg XR morning, 10mg IR to get through the midday slump. This combination has been much more helpful than my morning XR dose alone."
DecidingToBeBetter,fesmwsk,t3_eqewqh,1579366931.0,"Self-care is so important! Go ahead and add satin or silk pillowcases to your list. They'll do wonders for your hair, skin, brows, and lashes, especially if you're a side sleeper. I'm an esthetician and I've noticed lots of side sleepers have sparser brows and lashes on the side they sleep on, and as for myself I normally tend to have a lot of hair fallout in the shower. Since switching to satin pillowcases, the amount of hair fallout has been drastically reduced. I thought it was bullshit until I tried it myself, so now I feel the need to share the satin pillowcase love with anyone who will listen! As for the lash extensions, don't go cheap!! Invest in a highly rated and recommended lash artist with lots of experience, or you may end up with drugstore lash clusters applied with wig glue, which can eventually ruin your natural lashes to the point of not growing back properly. Also keep in mind that lash extensions are addictive. Once they come off, you will miss them, and you will feel naked without them. Unfortunately, lots of people are allergic or can eventually develop an allergic reaction to the cyanoacrylate in lash glue. If you have swollen eyelids, red and itchy eyes, puffiness, or irritation within 48 hours of the lash application, contact your lash artist for immediate removal. These symptoms will not subside without intervention. I don't mean to scare you, but I've seen what can happen when lash extensions go wrong, and you only get one pair of eyes!!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fekq07t,t3_epj7gg,1579205218.0,"I compare bad jobs to bad relationships all the time, so I absolutely understand how you're feeling! Change is scary and often painful, but it's part of the growth process. Sometimes we stay in a stagnant job or dead relationship just because it's easier and more comfortable than the unknown. You feel regret and sadness because you're remembering the positive things and happy memories rather than the endless list of reasons why you deserve better. This feeling will hopefully pass when you realize all the new and exciting opportunities you have available now that you've left. Instead of blaming yourself for not trying harder, remind yourself of all the reasons you had to quit. Maybe you loved the job, but the negative work environment you were in or the people surrounding you were the reason you quit. Maybe it was the opposite: great company and coworkers, but the actual job itself was draining you. Whatever it was, you were unhappy enough to want to quit. Make a list of everything you hated and use it to narrow down what you're looking for and what you 100% will not settle for in your next job."

needadvice,fdihaxg,t1_fdi8ocd,1578442904.0,"Maybe try and look at it as an opportunity. A new business next door will bring lots of new customers for you, too. My mom's shop usually has about 15-20 customers per day, give or take. If the groomer next door to you is fairly successful, that's at least a couple hundred people per month seeing your restaurant who otherwise may not have known you were there. Use it to your advantage. Lots of people show up early to pick up their dog. Guess where the groomer is probably gonna suggest they wait? If it was my mom, she'd ask them to wait in the car, but if there was still a restaurant next door to her, she'd send them over there. Maybe you could even look into selling homemade dog treats to embrace the new business, and the new potential customers, next door."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fd3parl,t1_fd2u3h3,1578160539.0,"Castor oil won't necessarily regrow them, but it may help prevent hair breakage to possibly hold onto some of the brows they have left. If your friend decides to try it, tell them to do a spot test before fully slathering their brows with it in case it causes irritation or breakouts. One last recommendation: sleep on a satin or silk pillowcase, especially if they're a side sleeper. I started using one a couple weeks ago and I'm amazed with how much less hair fallout I have in the shower. I bought a cheap pair of satin pillowcases and matching eye mask from Marshall's for about $7 and they work just fine!"

beauty,fcx9lf3,t3_ej8qxt,1578056507.0,"I signed up for a gym membership & personal trainer a few months after a rough breakup. The guy who signed me up asked me why I wanted to join, what was my motivation, etc. I burst into tears and explained I just got dumped for a girl 10 years younger than me and I wanted revenge body. In hindsight, I should have signed up for counseling instead of a gym membership, and I wish someone had suggested that because although I did go to the gym a bit, I didn't go often enough to get my money's worth and the personal trainer was not worth how much I spent, especially since we only had sessions once a week.
