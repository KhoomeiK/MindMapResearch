Denmark,fft38fq,t1_ffr61m1,1580204699.0,"Det var sgu noget af en udtalelse, alligevel. Går du selv på universitetet lige nu? Mit gæt er nej, for du lægger det ud som om samtlige fakulteter på samtlige danske universiteter er radikalt venstreorienterede tænketanke og ekkokamre. Det går jeg ud fra du ikke mener, men hvis man tager din kommentar bogstaveligt er det mere eller mindre det du siger.

Jeg synes du burde slappe lidt af med at male fanden på væggen. Halvandet år inde på studiet har jeg kun været til et eneste seminar, der bare lugtede af noget Nordamerikansk ""radikal feminisme"" eller hvad man kalder det (det var oven i købet noget jeg tog til helt frivilligt, der intet havde med studiet at gøre), og jeg noterede mig da et par væsentlige kritikpunkter af forelæsningen, som jeg snakkede ganske stille og roligt med mine medstuderende og forelæsere om bagefter.

Din påstand om at jeg og diverse andre studerende ikke har lov til at tænke og tale frit, i hvert fald på mit universitet, er ganske enkelt ikke korrekt. Uden at kunne tale for andre universiteter specifikt kunne jeg forestille mig at det forholder sig på lignende måde de fleste steder. Og selv hvis der *er* miljøer på universiteterne, hvor det er tilfældet, så tror jeg det er rimelig sandsynligt at de kun findes i større koncentration i nogle dele af humaniora.

Som jeg har forstået det er kønsteori eller feministisk analyse eller hvad ellers det måtte være ikke blevet det nye dogme indenfor socialvidenskaben eller psykologi. Så, i hvert fald for mit eget vedkommende (da mit fag ligger et sted mellem de to) er jeg sgu ikke videre bekymret."
offmychest,fferoir,t1_ffen0qt,1579862215.0,"Now with all due respect (and I hope we can discuss this civilly), voting for Trump *does* seem crazy to me (a non-US citizen might I add). So, I am quite curious as to what made you do that.

You voted for the dude who said climate change is a hoax and wants to make it worse. Who has essentially allowed asbestos to be used in buildings again. Who wants to slash abortion rights for women. Who has already given tax cuts to the rich and inflated your national debt.

Oh, and let's not forget the whole Iran debacle.

I simply cannot fathom why you have any positive view of the man at all. Was the policies you liked worth all of the above?

I realize I may appear to be painting you into a corner here; I don't mean to. If you feel I am misrepresenting something please do tell. I just don't even know where to start with this whole thing."
offmychest,fferh5g,t1_ffekfoa,1579861906.0,"European here. I'm curious; how the hell did the anti-immigrant sentiment get so big in the US? I mean, you're a huge goddamn country with, as you mention, really tight immigration laws. How is it even an issue worthy of anything beyond individual state attention?

Did the right wingers just take advantage of the migrant crisis in Europe and go ""yeah guys we're totally next if we don't tighten up"" or something? Even though you're literally on the other side of the Atlantic? I just can't fathom how the US has gotten the idea that the amount of immigrants it gets is actually a significant number.

Or is all of this debacle about Mexicans?"
offmychest,ffercbi,t3_et5uoo,1579861703.0,"> “Yeah but at least you have freedom of speech.” 

Just like damn near other country in the (for lack of a better term) ""Western World"", and several beyond that.

In short, I completely agree with you (even though I am not from the states and only have an outsider's perspective). In my home country (Denmark), the US is often used as a scapegoat in politics; we don't want our country to slip into ""American conditions"".

Best of luck in your next presidential election. Hope you don't elect another crony or wannabe dictator."
RavnicaDMs,ff7j19f,t1_ff76w9c,1579650698.0,Thank you! Glad to hear it gave you some ideas! :)
RavnicaDMs,ff7iyi1,t1_ff7flzv,1579650647.0,"I've already taken a heck of a lot of inspiration from the Ravnica cards for a bunch of things (I can really recommend fleshing out the Dimir roster a bit more with their cards, for example. Loads of ghost thieves and cool horrors). I haven't checked many of the demon cards out from the Ravnica sets though, maybe I sould.

Lord of the Void certainly looks more eldritch than demonic, which I think fits right in with the Dimir. I also think the GGR mentions that demons, being demons, more often than not rebel against Rakdos' alleged authority, so I think it would be entirely feasible to see demons doing their own thing everywhere.

Hell, I plan on having [Vilis the Blood Broker](https://tappedout.net/mtg-card/vilis-broker-of-blood/) show up at one point as an Orzhov aligned (ish) demon who is using the Syndicate as a front for his soul-stealing scheme. Not that he's a Ravnican demon in the card game, I just thought he screamed Orzhov the moment I saw him.

EDIT: Incidentally, I would probably stat a guy like Vilis as a Horned Devil or Pit Fiend depending on how powerful I want him to be. As for the Lord of the Void... His aesthetics and rather high power level lend him to being one of the big, flying heavy-hitters. Possibly a slightly refluffed Balor that deals necrotic damage and uses claws maybe?

Hell, he could be a slightly speedier Nalfeshnee with a beefed up Horror Nimbus; he seems to look like a demon who could scare you shitless with a horrifying display of eldritch colours from out of space."
RavnicaDMs,ff6xz9b,t1_ff6xyeu,1579637196.0,"# And finally, Yugoloths!

Yugoloths are a wacky bunch with no real unified aesthetics (Demons are mostly red and monstrous, devils are usually satanic, et cetera). As such, I find them unimpressive as a group, but quite cool individually. Also, all yugoloths can teleport… For some reason.

**Arcanaloths** are really cool. Sly, knowledge-seeking fox fiends that can alter shape, blot a room in darkness or turn invisible at will, and boil your armour and throw magic missiles at you without breaking a sweat. And that’s *before* using any of their many spell slots.

This demon works in pretty much any guild that heavily employs arcane magic of one sort or another. He’s unlikely to take center stage in a Rakdos show, but he might tag along with one of their caravans to bargain in secrets and unholy power with whatever mortals come by. For the same reason, he’d probably be decent as a spy or arcane researcher for the Dimir or Orzhov. Hell, one of these fellows can probably be found infiltrating any of the blue guilds; I can imagine that an Arcanaloth could play the part of an Azorius lawyer, while secretly spying on them for his Dimir associates.

**Mezzoloths** are a bit weird. Since they’re resistant to magic and can cast Dispel magic, they might be employed by any faction that wishes for a good solid squad of magehunters. Their insect aesthetic and ability to cast Darkness and Cloudkill makes them, like the Chasme, perhaps a decent fit for a Golgari insect monster demon. I think it deserves a cooler weapon than a trident though.

**Nycaloth** is kinda just a better Mezzoloth; it has more spells (only lacking cloudkill) and casts them at will. Aesthetically, though, I find it a bit lacking. It’s a big fat gargoyle with an axe that makes mirror images of itself. It seems a bit… generic? There are plenty of gargoyle-esque monsters already, and this one’s abilities do not seem tailored around any particular theme. Use it in any faction where you think a gargoyle demon with an axe feels fitting. Probably either Orzhov or Rakdos.

**The Ultroloth,** however, is really cool (It kinda looks like a martian crossed with an aristocrat, which I find is a really interesting look that sets it apart from the other yugoloths), and has some interesting abilities on top of the usual Yugoloth at-will spells. It has a charming hypnotic gaze, and several spells dealing with mind manipulation such as Suggestion, Fear and Mass Suggestion. Also, *it can fly without wings!* How cool is that? It also has some fire spells for some reason, which I kinda think clashes with its identity as a mind manipulator demon, but use it if you think it’s cool.

If you were to give the Ultroloth extra psychic damage on its attacks (a la Githyanki and Githzerai) and play up the mind magic aesthetic, you would pretty much have the ultimate Dimir demon here. It turns invisible, it flies, it teleports, it can disguise itself, it can manipulate whole crowds of people or charm heroes to its service, *and* it detects thoughts! Give it the Encode Thoughts cantrip and it is practically written to be a Dimir demon. More powerful Ultroloths might, like the Yochlol, have Dominate Person as well.

However, you could easily make it a demon that’s all about creating havoc for the Rakdos and subverting the other factions. It can disguise itself as a rabble-rouser and Mass Suggestion a crowd into anarchy, or use that same power to cause Azorius police to use violence on peaceful protesters. It can set entire neighbourhoods on fire with a couple of spells, then teleport or fly away or simply vanish. Any group of psychotic anarchists would like having an ultroloth on their side. You might wanna change the alien look, though, to fit with the “mind-bending pyromancer demon”-aesthetic.

**That's it friends! I hope this has inspired you to use more fiends in your game!**"
RavnicaDMs,ff6xyeu,t3_es00ur,1579637183.0,"# Devils!

**Barbed Devil.** I really don't need to say a lot here, do I? The Barbed Devil is a Rakdos torture instrument made manifest. It has spikes all over it and it hurls fire at you. What more could you possibly want?

**The Bearded Devil** is a weird case- It is immune to fright if allies are nearby, has a poisonous beard, and a glaive that causes “infernal wounds” which deal damage over time.

I think if you turned the beard into creepy lovecraft tentacles and made him part squid, you would have a really interesting *Simic* demon; what would happen if a crazy Simic scientist tried to make a Simic Hybrid infused with Aboleth DNA and dark magic, and stick a magical glaive in its hand? Oh, and he made it resistant to fear and gave it supernatural devil’s sight. Perfect for a “science has created a creepy lovecraft supersoldier” story.

**The Bone Devil** is a personal favourite of mine because it just looks so *freaky* and diabolic, and if you stick a polearm in its hands it becomes downright terrifying. 

The vaguely insectoid and scorpion-like build, plus the fact that he’s made of bones, lends itself fairly well to the Golgari aesthetic. His necromantic, boney appearance could also make him the result of an Orzhov or Dimir necromancy experiment.

**Chain Devils.** Cue the inevitable Rakdos BDSM jokes. The Chain devil is a dervish that scares you by using illusion magic to turn its face into that of your loved ones or enemies; it’s obviously perfect for the Rakdos arena. With some modifications, it could maybe work as a Dimir demon; perhaps as another fiendish clockwork creature whose chains are hidden by a big, black cloak, and whose real face is actually just a blank, white mask? Could be pretty creepy.

**Erinyes**. Evil fallen angels with hellish poisoned weapons, black armour and sometimes ropes of entanglement. They seem quite fitting for either the Orzhov if you want to play up the Black Knight / Fallen Angel part, or the Rakdos, if the winged-warrior-woman-gladiator-demon aesthetic is more to your liking. In the case of the Orzhov, you could even cast them as *actual angels*, or at least creatures that are on the borderline between White and Black; maybe paladins don’t actually get bonus smite damage against them?

If a Deathpact angel is a vain creature that surrounds itself with supplicants, the Erinyes is a bloody avenger angel who slays enemies of the syndicate and collects debts; blood-soaked and on the verge of slipping into full-blown demonhood. A Rakdos Erinyes may have once been a Boros Legion angel who was overcome with bloodlust and spiralled into murderous, demonic insanity. Plenty to play with here.

**Horned Devil.** This creature is probably the fiend with the most satanic aesthetic in the game; horns, wings, tail and a trident. Oh, and it hurls fire. As such, while you could use it as yet another Rakdos demon, I also find it would work well as an Orzhov demon. Maybe the Orzhov trap the spirits of those who defy the Syndicate and put them into their own personal little hell, with these guys torturing them for eternity? Alternatively, its flight and fire-throwing ability makes it a decent pick for an Orzhov air force to combat the Boros Legion’s angels, or as a guard watching over Orzhov mansions like a gargoyle.

**Ice Devil.** This one is… Strange. It combines an ice aesthetic with an insect aesthetic. All it really has is the ability to make a wall of ice, and potentially a spear that reduces speed and actions taken per turn. I honestly don’t know where I’d use it; like the Balor, it might possibly be better used as a stand-in for an Izzet ice mech or something.

**The Imp** is essentially the same as the quasit (and in my opinion the cooler of the two). It can do all the same things (spying, invisibility, poison attacks, familiar), and fits right at home in most of the black guilds (perhaps the quasit fits the Golgari aesthetic a bit better. You be the judge).

**Lemures** are, like the Manes, boring mechanically, but interesting aesthetically. They could be Orzhov tenants whose bodies have been turned into flesh-crafted muck, and animated by their enslaved spirits to forever guard some place or other. Who knows. Play around with them if you like.

**Pit Fiend.** This guy is kinda like a more sophisticated balor; with a fear aura, loads of attacks and a couple of interesting and flavourful spells (including *at will fireballs*), this guy is right at home with the Rakdos. Or, perhaps, if he slings evil, soul-fuelled balefire around, the Orzhov. He’s going to be flavourful whereever you put him, and might just want to offer the players a deal rather than a fight. A really cool monster, and it’s difficult to place him in a spot where he wont work, except perhaps the Golgari.

**The Spined Devil** seems like a Horned Devil and Barbed Devil had a baby. It will probably work pretty well in the same contexts as those guys. Given that both of the other two exist, I find this one a tiny bit boring. Also, instead of having it hurl fiery spines from its tail, why not just give it the common devil ability to Hurl Flame, like both the Horned and Barbed devil? Just a thought."
RavnicaDMs,ff6srgf,t3_erxy98,1579634120.0,"The simple fact that all classes are available to all guilds makes it (IMO) pointless to make healing spells part of every guild's spell list. If a Rakdos party wants to have a healer, they can get a healer! Of course a Rakdos cleric would heal his party members; they're useful to him! Self-interest can easily drive you to help others.

Adding healing to all of them makes each guild spell list less special and less thematic. It makes sense that, since the Rakdos *specialize* in red and black magic, healing is not their primary forte. A Rakdos healer is one that supplements the Guild's primary magic with additional stuff; just like a Selesnya wizard that throws fireballs.

So as far as I am concerned: A Rakdos cleric is a guildmage that has either learned some white magic (which shouldn't be forbidden in a guild with no rules), or perhaps all his healing is blood magic based! Who knows, but it really isn't hard to hand-wave with a bit of creativity."
RavnicaDMs,ff6rpjn,t1_ff6qwod,1579633484.0,"In that case, go nuts with the encounter design! :D

Glad to hear that my advice is appreciated. I'm a five-ish year veteran DM who has essentially realized that Challenge Rating is basically a big lie. We expect (Even if the books say something different) that a CR-appropriate fight is going to be an epic boss fight. More likely, a CR appropriate monster is going to be bitchslapped in two rounds if fighting alone, regardless of the party's level. I have seen 5th level players send a CR 13 vampire running for his bloody life within a couple of turns, simply because they had an orc warboss to tank some of his hits for them. In other news, I recently was a player myself in a party of five 4th level characters who managed to take down a CR 9 young red dragon by clever tactics and exploiting the fact that we had way more turns than it did.

What truly matters are the affordances of the monster. How many actions, how many bad things *per* action, and what (if any) side effects to its attacks. How it intends to survive being damaged, that sort of thing. Immunities to crippling status effects or Legendary Resistance, etc.

Three *shadows* is a much tougher monster group, arguably, than 3 specters (who are higher CR)... because shadows *drain strength!* That can absolutely cripple a party. Likewise, a mind flayer's mind blast is much more devastating than an equivalently-CR'ed Hezrou Demon's claw and bite attacks.

So... yeah! Make cleverer monsters rather than tougher monsters. Break the rules! Give them multiple turns! All that jazz. A bag of hit points and damage will always be a lackluster challenge to an appropriately levelled party in my opinion."
worldnews,ff6qf75,t1_ff6pv52,1579632720.0,"I seriously hope you're being sarcastic. [But this being the internet,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law) I can't always tell."
RavnicaDMs,ff6pv5c,t3_ervbke,1579632386.0,"I realized you're running a one-shot and that adding a great deal more monsters to each fight might slow it down to a crawl. An alternative, therefore, to my rather long and micro-intensive earlier post is to *only allow short rests* between the fights. That way, it will be a gruelling crucible of fight after fight after fight, to the point where even Lazav at the end might be a threat.

That way, you can perhaps justify using smaller and easier-to-manage encounters that are not too time-consuming and micro-intensive. Even if the first couple of guildmasters die like flies, hopefully the players will be quite worn down for the last couple of fights.

Oh, and maybe add the Paragon Monster rules for the guildmasters just in case."
RavnicaDMs,ff6mo90,t1_ff6mkyq,1579630464.0,"**Orzhov**

Here you have an advantage. Five Orzhov ghosts means 5 monsters means 5 turns. The problem is that their spells are shit and their damage pitiful. I mean, Ray of Enfeeblement? Against a 20th level party with loads of counterspells? Please.

I suggest heavily buffing all of the ghosts and giving them much nastier abilities; things like Save DC 22 Dominate Person or Power Word: Stun or something, or giving *each* of the ghosts 3 legendary actions (taht might be a lot of bookkeeping though). Or give them a Dracolich pet. Alternatively, you can show off just how badass these particular ghosts are by giving them *ranged* life drain!

I strongly suggest adding more angels and giants, and have them appear right at the beginning of combat (I guarantee you, as written, at least one or two ghosts are dead before the first round is over). The angels can charm the characters (maybe buff the save DC?) and then paralyze them! Plus, they can fly and deal a bit of damage to the players. As for the giants, again, more rocks. Gotta hit them ranged and flying characters.

**Azorius**

Your focus on counterspelling might shut your party down... for a round, maybe two. But parties alst much longer than that, and the opposition isn't that strong. Plus, *the party* likely has counterspellers too. And yes, you can counter a counterspell.

I suggest adding a Gynosphinx and Androsphinx to this encounter, bringing the amount of combatants up to five and giving the players yet more stuff to worry about. Also, the Lawmages Stoneskin spell is likely to not mean anything as it doesn't cover magic weapon damage.

Isperia's really not that tough! Consider giving her the shield spell and buffing her HP; she needs to actually survive if she wants to cast all those nice antimagic fields and divine words she's got going on.

**Golgari**

Consider the possibility that the *party* has 3 counterspellers among them (not unlikely). Now think about what that does to this encounter. You only have two enemy characters whose main focus is on damage-dealing spells. And who are on foot, and can't even cast Fly on themselves. For crying out loud, the average 20th level player is a better spellcaster than Jarad! (And the average Barbarian quite possibly has more hit points).

I suggest giving both of these guys a Dracolich to ride on, and then adding a lot of flying monsters, like a whole bunch of Chasme demons (who have a very buglike appearance) or Vrocks (who are both carrion bird-like *and* throw spores! Perfect Golgari demon).

Then have the entire thing take place in a vast underground cavern where the floor is full of toxic mushrooms which presents difficult terrain for non-Golgari or whatever.

**Boros**

I suggest giving Aurelia two Solar bodyguards and giving her somewhere around 3-6 other angels (I'd suggest 3 battleforce and 3 firemanes maybe) instead of 20 useless Boros soldiers (One 9th level meteor swarm and they're all dead).

Basically, Angel spam! All opponents are flying, and the solars have powerful ranged attacks. Plus, Aurelia actually has a lot of powerful monsters to actually *command* with her legendary actions, plus having a lot of subordinates with healing magic that can heal her!

**Rakdos**

If Rakdos ever faces the players alone, he is dead meat. Count on it. Instead, throw out the performers completely, and add everything in the encounter into one big wave! Keep the cackler and lampooner only if you buff their save DC's greatly. I suggest replacing them with more demons and devils, especially of the flying or status-inducing kind.

If you like the wave feel, then maybe throw everything you wrote into one wave, and then have Rakdos enter the battlefield after 2 or 3 rounds (whenever dramatically appropriate really), alongside a royal guard consisting of a Balor and a Pit Fiend!

And of course, buff the Save DC's for the Rakdos lair actions.

**Izzet**

This one might actually work (I'd still suggest adding more combatants though), but I would change one thing though. INstead of casting cantrips as a legendary action, have Niv Mizzet cast a *spell* as an action. If he doesn't, I bet he wont even manage to get low enough on spell slots to even *use* dracogenius.

Alternatively, you might want to make him a Paragon Monster with multiple turns and hit point pools a la this angry GM guide: [https://theangrygm.com/return-of-the-son-of-the-dd-boss-fight-now-in-5e/](https://theangrygm.com/return-of-the-son-of-the-dd-boss-fight-now-in-5e/). Hell, you might want to do that with all the guildmasters really.

**Dimir**

Lazav sucks at fighting. His entire stat block is focused on getting *out* of fighting. His main ability (shapeshifting) is useless in a straight fight. Also, he cant fly and has zero ranged options.

Thus, I suggest A), having the battle take place in a really cramped space and B), giving him the ability to cast Greater Invisibility at will, and to teleport around the battlefield (alternatively, give him a rogue's Cunning Action and the ability to use a bonus action to hide). Thus, whenever he wants, he can appear right behind a player and start shanking them, while invisible, and he'll teleport away once the players start attacking him. Also, I suggest giving him the Shield spell at will; that 18 AC doesn't count for much even if the players never get advantage against him.

Finally, add some more things that can distract from Lazav. I find that a couple of Mind Flayers or an Aboleth (Or an Illithilich or Elder Brain if you have Volo's Guide) would complement the Horrors quite nicely.

Or maybe add a mechanic where a Skittering Horror spawns every turn out of a crack in the wall or whatever; the players are not only fighting Lazav, they are fighting time.

**Wow, that was long**. Anyway, the short story is that the enocunters here are waaay underpowered. The only way to make them be challenging as written would be if the party had only short rests between them (in which case the first several encounters are still probably quite easy), and to severely restrict any flying shenanigans. I thus recommend that you buff them to seemingly ludicrous levels, because your players are also ludicrous!

Some of these ideas are fairly half-baked, and probably presents a lot of micro in some cases, so adjust at your leisure. Just my 2 cents."
RavnicaDMs,ff6mkyq,t3_ervbke,1579630408.0,"**Edit:** I realized after writing this post that you could really do a lot for these encounters if you just turned the Guildmasters into Paragon Monsters a la this angry GM article:   [https://theangrygm.com/return-of-the-son-of-the-dd-boss-fight-now-in-5e/](https://theangrygm.com/return-of-the-son-of-the-dd-boss-fight-now-in-5e/). It prevents stun-locking the guildmasters, and essentially allows you to field several of them at a time. Trostani, for instance, should surely have three turns!

Below is my original reply.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several of these are too easy by far, I reckon. One thing you'll want to watch out for is having too *few* antagonists. 5e is heavily biased against single monsters; action economy is alpha and omega to difficulty.

So I find that several of your encounters have *far* too few (and too weak!) combatants. I don't think there's nearly enough actions on the enemy side, and even nearly enough *hit points*; a 20th level party can easily deal 500 damage in a single round, which is enough to kill most ancient dragons outright! Now imagine the scenario that the party all roll really well on initiative, and your 400 hp-or-lower antagonist (read: *all* the guildmasters) rolls a 1. They're dead before they can take a turn.

Another problem is one of affordances; what can the opposition actually *do*? In the case of your borborygmos encounter, all you've really got is a *single* low-level caster (whose save DC the players will likely resist) and then a whole lot of monsters who have lots of HP and deal a lot of ordinary physical damage; damage that casters with Stoneskin or barbarians or whatever can easily resist. There is very few status effects, aoe abilities or whatever. Imagine what happens to poor Borborygmos if all the players have ranged attacks and can fly!

On the contrary, players have entire chapters' worth of skills and magic items each, and are ingenious little fuckers; they have five brains to your one, and they know their abilities way better than you know your monsters. And at 20th level, they have so much magic that they *will* out-shenanigan you quite easily. And remember, they have **long rests**, which means that for every encounter, they can throw out all they've got; 9th level spells, Lay on Hands, divine smites, magic item charges, you name it. The players will likely have way more cards on their hands than you do.

So, I am going to swing the pendulum the complete opposite direction and give you some suggestions that is going to make these encounters (probably) much too hard. Why? Two reasons. The first is, only in an encounter that is *too hard* do you actually force your players to be truly creative and cunning. And secondly, because in my experience, it is way easier to *downscale* an encounter mid-fight than *upscale* it. You can pick tactically unsound targets, for instance, or use less dangerous abilities, or ""forget"" that your monster has certain spells. Or roll behind the DM screen!

Therefore, these fights are intended to be as frustratingly difficult as possible.

**Gruul**

The main problem with this fight is that it's just a big hammer. Lots of HP, lots of physical (and therefore resistable) damage, and lots and lots of *melee* fighting. Like the Tarrasque, it's easy to outmaneauver. All you have to do is attack Borbo from extreme range (or flight, which every one in the party can have access to with the right magic items) and survive his rocks, which only deal 29 damage per throw. Barbarians and casters with stoneskin don't care about physical damage. Additionally, the druid of the old ways is kind of underpowered (possibly buff his save DC at the very least) and the anarchs will do scratch damage at most.

I therefore suggest that you add something with flight and non-physical damage. Such as, for instance, two ancient dragons! (One red, one green for symbolism). Perhaps you can make Borborygmos ride one of them, and have a slightly buffed Druid ride the other. Or you could remove the anarchs and add a couple more sunder shamans to provide more rock artillery. Or you could add a Skyswimmer or two.

Also, you could constrain flight and range by way of terrain; perhaps the fight takes place in a cave or underground arena that, conveniently, is small enough that the players will always be in range of Borbo's rocks? Or maybe the fight takes place during a storm, and Borbo can call a really nasty lightning bolt at flying characters?

If you really like the idea of having a ground-based fight with raw power, then have it take place in an underground cave and add a couple of Wurms who constantly come rumbling out of the walls at random.

**Zegana**

Too few characters (vulnerable to status effects), which means too few actions and too few hit points. Zegana herself is an *absolute pushover*; you only need to deal her 30 damage before you can cast power word: Kill on her!

I suggest having the battle take place not just underwater, but in an underwater dome (again, constricting flying), and adding at least 1 kraken to the encounter as Zegana's mount. For bonus points, what if Zegana had biomanced the brain of the Kraken out, and turned it's head into a cockpit from which she, fairly safely from attack, can control the giant monster? This means that either A), the party has to kill the Kraken before killing Zegana or B), they have to get close to the kraken to break open it's cockpit skull. Either way, they wont easily be able to snipe Zegana's 130 hit points away.

Also, add more everything. Additional biomancers, additional krasis, and have the Krasis be capable of flight if possible. Lair actions would also be advisable.

**Selesnya**

The idea with having an Archdruid buffing Trostani and aiding her is not bad at all; it creates two unignorable threats for the players, not just the guildmaster. Trostani's main problem is that her main speciality is buffing her allies and dealing *melee damage*; and yet her AC is 17 and she has a pitiful 252 hit points.

I suggest you give Trostani something to actually *heal.* So, more minions, preferabbly something that has a lot of hit points and causes a lot of damage at great range (Might I suggest a small army of 10 rock-throwing treants?), and a means for her to avoid damage. Again, a green dragon mount might not be a bad idea. Alternatively, you might give her a fuckton of conclave dryads and rule that, if Trostani is ever knocked out, one of the conclave dryads sacrifices itself as a reaction in order to ressurect her, transferring it's remaining hit points to her.

books,ff5mfml,t1_ff56m23,1579600160.0,"Having read the comments here, I am quite convinced that reading them in original publishing order adds something to the experience. However, to say that the books are ruined by doing otherwise is a bit extreme, don't you think?

Incidentally, I'm young enough to have only known the chronological publishing, and I did indeed read the Magician's Nephew as the very first book. And I enjoyed it greatly! It's a good story, context or no context.

Hell, most of the books are great even if read in isolation from the rest of the series (Do you need to know who the four Pevensies are to enjoy Horse and his Boy, for instance?), and I think it diminishes the quality of the writing to say that they fall apart if not read in a certain order."

Cooking's a big one; I live in a dorm and share a kitchen with a bunch of people, and I often get really self-conscious about whether other people are secretly sneering at my inferior culinary skills. I think it's mostly projection; it only really happens if I myself am not particularly impressed with myself.

RavnicaDMs,fed9d6s,t3_eoja99,1579004543.0,"Basically, when it comes to the Magic universe, pretty much anything goes that fits loosely within the domain of one of the five colors of magic. There may not be a ""fleshmage"" class in DnD, but given that the Orzhov are a white/black faction, it's probably a school of black mages at work.
Black, incidentally, is pretty much the necromancy colour. Whether it be spirit binding, creating Frankenstein's monster out of scavenged body parts, or turning people's bodies into bubbling soups of flesh or creating [literal walls of blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall%20of%20Blood), black magic  has you covered.

So, as already mentioned here, I basically flavoured Orzhov flesh mages as some sort of specialized necromancer that, well, creates things out of dead flesh. Whether that be thrulls, Warcraft III style abominations or artsy flesh sculptures with still-beating hearts and moving eyes.

Basically, do whatever man. It's a black magic user of some kind; stat him however you think would fit. There's no ""right"" way to do it, because taking the magic universe and converting it to DnD is kinda like getting a square peg through a round hole."
offmychest,fed8njt,t1_fed5lw9,1579003808.0,"I'm going to rant a bit here, because while I think your reply is perfectly well-intentioned, I can't help but disagree quite fundamentally.

Basically, I find it weird that it always becomes a question of ""excuses"". Rough childhood leading to bad decisions isn't an excuse; it's a statistic. People are, in some dimensions, fairly predictable. For every example you can find me of a person rising above their terrible past due to heroic willpower or whatever, there's probably hundreds of examples of people in similar situations who failed.

I don't care about whether something is or isn't an excuse for something. That's a question for moral philosophy, but it's fairly irrelevant to whether or not *it is important to help people* who have had a rough start to life. For the simple reason that that will, statistically, make them less likely to fuck up.

People's pasts *do* hold them back. It's a fact. It's really a question of learning and experience; just as a person who hasn't trained in baseball is a shitty baseball player, someone with a rough upbringing has poor life experience. If you expect that person to play a good game of baseball *or* be a model citizen, you're going to have a bad time.

Are there better or worse ways to deal with trauma? Yes. Can you morally expect people to always know which is the best way to deal with their trauma? No. People are not psychologists.

Making it a game of excuses feeds right into right-wing propaganda. There's not much benefit to society in discussing excuses or guilt; only cause and effect."

INTP,fe5lrh8,t3_ens17b,1578871033.0,"Sure. I have a couple fairly effective ones, that work for me at least.

\- Music. Sometimes there's catharsis to listening to angry or sad music when you feel those emotions, but be wary that they don't bring you further down. Upbeat music might also be just the thing to cure your sadness or channel your agitation or anger into excitement instead.

\- Video games. Nothing quite like putting on a hack'n'slash or strategy game and watching things die gloriously for a while to calm you down.

\- **Other people.** This is a big one. If you know someone well, and know they respect you and care reasonably about you, you can always ask them if they would mind if you off-loaded a bit. Be a bit careful in whom you choose, it's not something that's comfortable saying no too (that would probably lead to some awkward silence), but someone you trust to care enough for you to lend their ear and offer advice. Talking things through with a different person than yourself, with all your self-doubt and the like, is probably the most constructive way of dealing with emotions going rogue."
INTP,fe5kupa,t1_fe5izzk,1578870717.0,"Yowch, now you're asking the hard questions.

I'll start with the second one and claim that, ehhh, that might not be true. This really, really isn't my area of expertise (Hell, I'm an undergrad, so *nothing is.* Please bear that in mind), but I *think* I recall that emotional areas of the brain are quite involved in decision making *in pretty much all people*.

Also, depending somewhat on your definition of emotions, it isn't hard to argue that they're essentially what gets you up in the morning. And why the hell you live; aren't we all chasing either happiness, satisfaction or pride, or curiosity? All of these are emotions, I would argue, in the neuroscientific sense, and I'd wager they all have measurable physiological correlates to them as well.

Sooo, I don't really know if I understand what is meant by 'obsolete', but it's certainly untrue that INTPs either A), don't have emotions or B), don't use them at all to guide their behaviour.

What causes emotions to occur? Yeesh. Well, the sort of cheating answer is brain activation in appropriate areas, in response to stimuli. Basically, emotions are thought to guide behaviour and decision making, yeah? So that means that when a stimulus is processed by the sensory areas of your brain (say, a visual stimulus of a charging bear being processed by your visual cortex), eventually the stimulus will be processed by your emotional centers as well. If the stimulus, by some cognitive process I cannot begin to describe accurately, is evaluated by that brain area to be worth paying attention to for some reason (your amygdala tends to respond to fear stimuli, and might begin to fire in the presence of a charging bear), it's likely to start sending signals to all sorts of relevant parts of the nervous system (not just the brain) to get you into a good ol' fearful mood, and probably send a signal to the frontal cortex going something along the lines of ""RUN AWAY YOU DIPSHIT"".

That's the, uh, not very technical and definitely not expert treatment of the subject I can provide in five minutes at a late hour."
INTP,fe5inpf,t1_fe5h0xf,1578869936.0,"Cognitive science student here, and I am going to invoke Poe's Law on myself and assume you're not being sarcastic.

Basically, we don't actually know. Nobody in psychology can agree on what the basic building blocks of them are. Generally, though, emotions are considered to be evolutionarily beneficial adaptations that *provokes action*. Say, disgust will make you remove yourself from potentially poisonous substances (and avoid eating them or contracting diseases).

Emotions also contain both conscious and unconscious parts; the conscious bit is often called the ""feeling state"" in the literature, whereas the unconscious bit has to do with the physical response to the emotion. Fear leads to increased heart rate, but that seems different from the conscious feeling of fear. Generally, remotions are hedonic, in that they are rewarding or punishing, and transient (i.e., they don't last that long. Longer-lasting emotions are generally called ""moods""). Some stimuli may be recorded as having an emotional state in long term memory.

Now what are emotions ""made of""? That's a much more muddy topic and where much of the agreement ends.

That's essentially the basic picture, at least if my paraphrased notes are to be believed (I did have a quick look in a second semester textbook, and I don't think I have misrepresented the facts."
INTP,fe5gxvd,t3_ens5ew,1578869307.0,"I am skeptical that there's much of a ""we"" to speak of here, as you can indulge curiosity in quite a lot of ways. One of my nerd friends does electronic music in his spare time while studying, and seems to hope to make a career out of it if he can. I think he mentioned at one point he scored INTP, even though he doesn't regard the MBTI scale very highly. I myself wouldn't touch electronic music with a ten foot pole. I am more of a DnD, LARP and Magic the Gathering type of guy, and would definitely be gunning for a career as a scientist. Point is, people vary a lot.

Still, if you like theory, anything in higher education is a decent place to start. I'm studying cognitive science at the moment (a wonderful hodgepodge of psychology, neuroscience and data science and some social sciences too) and I am perfectly happy with it. I wanted to be a biologist when I was a kid, though, and in high school I hated physics but now I find it fascinating.

Trying to predict which career you should pick based on your personality type alone is unlikely to end well for you. There are quite simply more than 16 jobs in the world, obviously.

INTP,fe5e9il,t1_fe2igq4,1578868289.0,"My experience is that common sense is A), trainable and B), increases with life experience in general.

When people call attention to things in the environment or ask you to get fetch something or carry out a practical task, I find that you gotta take conscious effort to use your senses carefully, pay close attention when given instructions, repeat those instructions aloud a couple of times, and ask twice the first time just be sure you got it. You'll look a bit weird, but you'll look far weirder if you come walking back a minute later asking again.

Basically, I find that the best way to develop common sense is to learn from your mistakes, listen well to other people's advice (cause odds are, they've got more common sense than you do), and don't be afraid to ask questions. Even 'stupid' ones. Every stupid question asked now is one that you wont ask later."

In my experience, the solution is order and structure, and no small amount of stubbornness to improve your faults. I tried small things like meditation, attempting to keep a schedule, and regularly cleaning my room. Shaving my beard more regularly, and hell, even giving a crap for how I looked and making an effort to look good, and exercising as regularly as I could.

Even things like trying a couple of times to plan your entire week from start to finish with a calendar, even if you don't do it consistently afterwards, still made managing my time much easier on the fly because I got a much better *idea* of how much time I had. I don't do calendars much, aside from facebook events, but having tried it made my mind sharper.

In short: It all sorta worked. I get periodic bursts of really productive, super-ego like moments of willpower and productivity before laziness sets in again, but it's certainly better than before. 3/5 stars.

INTP,fe5ah25,t1_fe22pfr,1578867026.0,"I completely agree with most of your criticisms. We are mostly, in these cases, looking at *adult humans* who have gone through 20+ years of socialization and life experience, mapping their archetypes, and claiming their behaviour is due to ""personality"". Well, we don't know what caused that personality to play out the way it did; the causal relations are all muddy. In a sense, you're painting the bullseye around the arrow.

Also, before *anyone* quotes me (and I should probably write it in my original comment too), 50% accuracy (on what parameters?) was just a nonsense statement I made as an example; it wasn't a judgment about the average accuracy of MBTI tests.

I agree completely on job applicability and the like. The use of MBTI and other, similarly conducted tests in workplace contexts is certainly unfortunate if the test is assumed to carry more authority than it merits. But, if nothing else, what a person answers to an MBTI test *will tell you something* about that person, assuming that they weren't lying.

I also have a sneaking suspicion that, at least in the case of *some* types like INTP, you might get such a relatively homogenous community as this one because it *actually* tests for traits of ADHD or some variants of autism, which at least are real phenomena that quite a lot of people are affected by."
INTP,fe0yvv8,t1_fe0ccf7,1578820508.0,"Cognitive Science student here. Models of personality are not at all passé in psychology and related sciences. MBTI has fallen out of favour, sure, but it's still often brought up in comparison to other models, such as the Big Five model.

It's all a question of *explained variance* versus *unexplained variance* (error). Nobody is expecting a model to map human personality completely.

But what if you had, say, a model that predicted about 50% of your life outcome or the problems you were likely to struggle with, based on a questionnaire that evaluated a couple of personality factors? That's a pretty good model, wouldn't you say? It's certainly useful, even with a 50% error margin! And *far* beyond astrology or palm reading or whatever.

Am I saying MBTI is that good? Nope. It isn't that great of a model because indeed, people aren't archetypes. I could probably find some estimates of its accuracy on google scholar but its early in the morning here and I'm lazy.

But what I am saying is that it may explain *some* variance while leaving potentially a lot unexplained. It doesn't, in other words, necessarily mean nothing."
INTP,fe0xcwp,t3_enk26r,1578819793.0,"I actually had quite the same thought several years back. I've got a couple of comments on the matter.

There's a decent reason to believe that culture is one of our main evolutionary selling points as a species. Specifically, the ability to *transfer information, practice and knowledge* *faithfully* from one generation to the next. This is what allows the next generation to not have to reinvent the wheel (and fire, stone axes and whatever else their parents made) all the time, and therefore allows incremental improvement over long generations.

Cultural evolution (or culture-gene coevolution) has been the main driver of human civilizational progress. Humans are *addicted* to culture. Our colons are shorter than most other great apes our size because we've been eating cooked food for so long; yet there is *no human gene* that codes for the capacity to make fire!

Evolutionarily speaking, therefore, humans should value their culture highly and trust it over their own intuition. After all, reinventing the wheel is hard, and if what your ancestors did aint broken, don't fix it. Especially if it isn't broken *enough* to threaten the long-term survival of the species (Small-scale human suffering such as oppression of women or sexual minorities, in-group out-group bigotry and whatever else is no hurdle in the long run from an evolutionary perspective).

This line of reasoning might as well be a human instinct, and that's how you get conservatism. Much like religion and other social institutions, culture is part of what formed the backbone upon which our society rests. That we can begin to liberate our thinking from it speaks only to its strength, actually. You are a heavily cultured person; the way you dress, how you act in traffic, and what your ethics are, even your understanding of yourself and the world, it's all very heavily cultural. Not necessarrily the mainstream, but even counterculture is culture.

Which leads to why we're having this discussion in the first place: Only in a culture that criticizes itself and promotes individual thought would we be as likely as we are to think that culture is bullshit. Which it kinda is.

EDIT: Also, forgot to mention what meagre sources I have.

Culture-gene coevolution and cultural evolution is a pretty common topic in archaeology these days, so Google scholar can likely net you some hits.

Namely, IQ is... well, it's theoretical underpinnings are not exactly rock-solid. For one, people's IQ seem to correlate with the quality of their education system (the Flynn effect), and it may not be normally distributed across the population at all; we just assume that it is.

And the worst sin in my humble opinion is that IQ doesn't capture all the things the brain does, and all the parameters on which different brains will vary in their capacities. The stereotype of high IQ nerds with no social or sports skills is quite real (I myself fit the bill and I've met more examples than you can shake a stick at). The reason, presumably, is that you quite simply don't need those to score high on an IQ test. Despite the fact that you use your brain for both of those!

Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that the brain is A), highly plastic and B), it's capacities vary in more than one dimension (IQ).

As it happens, this very question is the main thing bugging me about the material released for Ravnica for the purposes of DnD (I am not a particularly avid magic player, so no judgment in that direction): So very little of it makes the sheer goddamn \*scale\* of it all apparant. Each of the Guilds has literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of ordinary mortal members depending on how you do the math; an actual all-out Guildwar could easily put the casualties and devastation of World Wars I and II to shame. And yet, the material seems to imply that there are only a couple of Boros Garrisons or Simic Zonots or whatever, rather than probably hundreds if not thousands. Likewise, the book never seems to imply that there is more than one big G Guildhall for each of the guilds, which seems... completely ridiculous. Am I to assume that Rakdos only has one lair, rather than at least 23 other convenient volcano-bases spread across the planet he could potentially retreat to?

Arguably the worst offender is the Gruul Clans, who appear to have, what, seven clans total? And this humongous planet-sized confederation-horde of barbarian tribes is led by a bumbling idiot with *sub-par intelligence,* and not even the slightest magical proficiency in a world called *Magic*? For that matter, the Gruul do not seem to have much of a hierarchy beyond chieftains of individual clans; how does that work if the number of clans is potentially in the hundreds of thousands? Colour me skeptical that brute strength and ""defeating all challengers"" can hold 5 million plus tribespeople together, and succesfully coordinate them in fighting a global cold war. As it stands, save for the fact that they might retreat into territory difficult to conquer, the Gruul as written would crumble if a Guildwar broke out.

Even if you were to argue that modern 21st century Prague is a high estimate for population density (the Gruul are actively trying to turn the planet into rubble and make Ravnica less densely populated; and surely some area has to go to agriculture, even if its efficient and urbanized or all in the undercity), the Guilds still seem to be written for a population of maximally a couple million people across the entire plane. Which honestly still feels like a lot.

Anyway, the really interesting thing here is that the scale of it almost ensures that the Guildpact is sooorta upheld, even in the absence of a Living Guildpact, because who the eff would benefit from an open war? I quite like that idea."
INTP,fdgdan1,t3_el2i22,1578391274.0,"What you're doing is perfectly normal and healthy. You're taking account of not just what to say, but how the other person is likely to respond, and trying to get through to them rather than make them more boneheaded. That's constructive, not deceptive.

Persuasion is only part your words and arguments, but also how you say them. People are irrational creatures; to get them to listen to reason, you first have to lower their defenses and ensure you're not a threat to their dearly held beliefs or pride.

I dare say, a person who *doesn't* tailor their speech to their audience is lacking a critical component of persuasion."
INTP,fdgd64j,t3_el6qn6,1578391089.0,"Well first off, you have enough self-reflection to certainly not be a retard.

Secondly, I don't know you, man, and I am not a psychologist. I seriously think you should consider seeking professional help; they'll be an awful lot better at helping you figure out how to reinvent yourself, if that's what you want."
INTP,fdgcy95,t1_fdfwa3f,1578390761.0,"After having practiced my small-talking skills to a point where I feel like I'm getting pretty good at it, I have a couple of comments to your questions.

- Some people like speaking in circles. I don't have a psychological answer for why (there probably is one), but they do. To interact with them succesfully, you need to simply accept that as a premise, and figure out how to respond properly. Which, yes, often involves repeating a couple of steps and reaffirming what the other is saying.

- Honestly giving a fuck about people's day is also a skill you can train, and people will appreciate you for it if you take the time to listen. One of the keys to conversation is to allow other people to talk and listen attentively. People like honest attention; you can choose to utilize this fact to your advantage when dealing with other humans, or ignore it. The choice is yours.

- Most people are actually quite nice and seldom manipulative. Furthermore, quite a lot of them have also been raised to be polite. As such, unless they're trying to sell you something or get you to do something, they are highly unlikely to manipulate you. Without knowing you well, I'd wager than in 9 times out of 10 where you've thought that, you have likely been wrong."
Denmark,fddgfs4,t3_eksbdc,1578311173.0,"Jeg synes, det hører med til historien, at man lader til at være inspireret af Norge, hvor det angiveligt har gået godt. Blandt andet skulle aktiveringen hjælpe med at lære sproget bedre (i kraft af at du kommer ud af din egen bobbel og snakker med andre mennesker).

Det gode spørgsmål er så hvordan nordmændene fik det til at fungere i praksis, for som så mange andre har kommenteret (og artiklen nævner) så er det lettere sagt end gjort."

worldnews,fd8v2u9,t1_fd6nx8p,1578223806.0,"You don't just walk in and assassinate people, especially not state officials, in other countries with whom you are not at war. Whether or not they're dickheads. What kind of right does the US have to do that?"
worldnews,fd8uwv1,t1_fd8a1re,1578223730.0,"I read your comment and I still don't quite understand:

a), why Iran needs to be kept in check by the US, and hence why ""this would have happened regardless""

b), why potentially starting a \*war\* will at all make the situation better given previous experience with US military ventures in the middle east.

c), and thus, why assassinating a general and escalating tensions is at all a good idea.

d), also, what kind of country just straight up assassinates state officials of other countries they are not at war with? That's gotta be illegal under some form of international law.

In short, I do not believe based on your argumentation that the US is blameless, nor that this could not have been avoided, merely because Iran is a theocratic regime."
Denmark,fd8tyhz,t1_fd8aj7u,1578223341.0,"Tja, som jeg har forstået det så er der få ting man som menneske kan foretage sig som, per time, udleder mere CO2 end at tage på flyrejser.

Så hvis Australien skal have en chance for at overleve skal vi altså skære gevaldigt ned på vores flytrafik. Derfor synes jeg det virker rimelig logisk at være imod en udvidelse."
