Get some canned air for the inner workings for cleaning out debris.  Don't get close with this--just close enough to blow the dust away.

You can then put the back back on....line everything up and use the palm of your hand to cradle the watch in...it acts as cushioning so that the crystal doesn't crack with the force.

I don't know about this one, but watches crystals used to be actual glass.  if it is, you can buff out any scratches using a dremel and some jewelers rouge but use a light hand and practice on something else first.  You can do this an acrylic crystals, too, but not something I recommend.
