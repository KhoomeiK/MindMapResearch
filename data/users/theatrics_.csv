What we're referring to here is called the ""mutation burden."" That is the amount of mutations incurred by the cancer over time. Cancers like melanoma and lung cancer - cancers caused by mutagens to epithelial cells (thinks cells in contact with things in the outside world), tend to have higher mutation burden.

A lot of people in the field for a long time thought that having a higher mutation burden would increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy, as the more mutations a cancer takes on, the more readily the immune system can detect it as foreign agent, and do what it was designed to do, kill foreign agents.

The thing to note, that's revolutionary about this paper, is that there appears to be an extremely effective biomarker for targeting cancer cells which has never been noticed before. 

While this is promising, it's only done in vitro, in the test tube. We'll need to translate this up to mice, then potentially humans, and this whole thing can fall apart, or lose integrity in that process. 

We will see what happens, but I bring up mutation burden because you have to realize, these are incredibly complex problems and the solution often ends up becoming a combination of specifically-targeted treatment along with some systemic, heuristically driven parameters, such as ""how much to give the patient"" and ""how strong the cells should be going in.""

Fact of the matter remains: we're using the immune system to target the body and the immune system is extremely effective. I personally doubt we'll ever get to an ""over the counter"" version of this treatment - which is what people are thinking ""off the shelf"" means here, which in this field means ""allogenic injections of t-cells"" - allogenic meaning, works on any genome, so not limited to the donor from which they came and grew up from."

I think Qui-Gon, in a sense, was made to represent the general failure of the Jedi, and abandoning their old ways which sustained peace. In a sense, they were puppets to a failing bureaucratic order while also being meddlesome to the natural order of things, arguably shifting the ""balance"" of the force and giving rise to the return of the Sith.

He talks about Anakin as if he's a part of a prophecy to bring balance to the universe: a universe which is now, for the most part, currently at peace, and seeming to be in balance as it was lacking effective sith influence.

Like, I don't expect this guy to give as much reason or thought to the subject that somebody like Contrapoints would, but I do think it's basically become his job to latch onto the wildly popular bullshit in the world of youtube and cast a critical eye towards it.

If you see his intentions as just stirring shit, then yeah, I hear you. But I also think he's got an intention of giving the trans discussion a bit more of a consistent vibe. 

I think his whole point is that we shouldn't parade a feel-good story which gives a message that seems to kind of reinforce the philosophies it virtue-signals to be against. That a message like this can do more damage than good."

It's not to say that it's some genetic trait or something (lol George), you can even argue that Han Solo had traits of force sensitivity too - I think it's just that being exposed to the force and having that faith in the force allows people to trust their instincts a bit more. 

RJ kind of ditched that idea, and suggested it as some sort of ""power of the proletariat,"" which honestly feels a bit trite and disrespectful to the lore and themes of the brand, imo."

StarWars,fdmkfjh,t1_fdmirnm,1578553227.0,"Very much this. 

Much of the movie we're seeing Padme judging Qui-Gon making decisions she doesn't find rational at all (betting a whole ship on a kid to beat professional racers?). 

Her apprehension is tempered, however, she just kinda lets the Jedis do their thing. But the minute she realizes all the political bullshit, she peaces out.

I think Qui-Gon, in a sense, was made to represent the general failure of the Jedi, and abandoning their old ways which sustained peace. In a sense, they were puppets to a failing bureaucratic order while also being meddlesome to the natural order of things, arguably shifting the ""balance"" of the force and giving rise to the return of the Sith.

He talks about Anakin as if he's a part of a prophecy to bring balance to the universe: a universe which is now, for the most part, currently at peace, and seeming to be in balance as it was lacking effective sith influence.

Qui-Gon's whole character, arguably, represented the folly of the Jedi order. Think about it. He never wins any battles. Only makes bad decisions. Completely ignores the wisdom of his elders. His whole purpose was basically to serve as a mentor for Obi-Wan and to die."

Except Rian Johnson and party had to close every single thread that Abrams opened. So instead it was concluded like a loose thread filler and replaced with some shitty half-baked romantic interest with what's-her-face.

So yeah, Finn got dicked pretty hard by mixed writers. Honestly, it would have been more memorable if he did kill himself to save his friends in TLJ."
