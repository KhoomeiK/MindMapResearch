cats,fekz8ev,t3_eppqxe,1579210679.0,"Be prepared for fireworks for a while. Introducing another cat is always going to upset the balance. My family never had fewer than two cats, and up to five at one point, all differing ages and all new to each other at one point or another. Introducing a new one was like shaking a proverbial snow globe and it took a while for all the existing hierarchies to settle into a new pattern. The only thing that finally united the cats was a common enemy -- a dog!

My advice is to give the new cat a safe room with food/water/litter that you can shut her in at night and during the day if things get too heated (they will both also start get used to each other through the door). Depending on how things go it might be best to keep her shut away any time you're not there to supervise. You might also consider shutting your existing cat in the room for a few hours and let the new one explore the house alone. That way she'll get more comfortable with her new surroundings without the stress of another cat pestering her. Being un-spayed, I would not let her outside if that's an option.

It's hard to tell how long it'll take for them both to accept each other -- it can be quick or it can take weeks. In rare cases I've heard of cats instantly taking a liking to a newbie. Whatever the case, expect some posturing (with much growling and hissing), occasional fights (that usually look/sound worse than they are), and potentially blood being spilled (usually minor cuts, so just clean them with a mild peroxide solution up if needed).

Also, be sure to continue giving your existing cat plenty of attention. Being an only cat she might start to feel unwanted if you bring a new cat into the house. Once things have settled down you can enjoy watching a whole new set of feline behaviors -- cat-cat interactions are much more fun to observe than cat-human interactions."

travel,feho1i2,t3_ep01b7,1579120437.0,"In my experience you just has to get back to your normal routine and stick to it -- sleep, activity, and meals all at normal times (including alarms to wake you at normal times) will help reset your clock. Yes, you'll feel groggy during the day and will likely wake up during the night, but just accept that for a few days. Trying to sleep and eat at normal times are the two big ones -- you have to endure a few days of feeling tired and/or hungry at certain times, but I just try to get on with life and forget about it. Exercise will also help you feel better and make you feel more alert, and it will get you outdoors into bright light, which is essential for resetting your body clock. 

If you must take a nap during the day (and I often do) then keep it brief (under 30 mins) and force yourself to get up, regardless of how groggy you feel. The last thing you want to do is nap too much then not be able to sleep at night. Melatonin never worked for me, and from what I've read most of the melatonin supplements contain little to no effective melatonin anyway. 

Trying to hack jet lag is pointless IMO because you're essentially introducing more jet lag to your body by forcing it into another unnatural routine. Your body will just fight you the whole way."

Who modded your MH20?"
flashlight,fefoizx,t1_fef81aj,1579060892.0,"What happened to your modded MH20?

Actually I just discovered Nitecore does a version of the MH20 (not the GT) with a neutral white XM-L2 emitter. But there seems to be absolutely no information on the actual bin/temp or CRI of said emitter. I've just seen a few beamshots and it look like it's somewhere between 4000 and 5000K, although probably with a CRI around 70, which is not ideal. I emailed them but am not holding my breath for a reply. 

Same problem with Thrunite (TC15 and Neutron V3 are nice compact lights) -- I've seen no specs for the neutral white XHP35 emitter they use (EasyWhite D4?), and no reviews that shed any light on the overall tint/quality. I assume it's around 5000K, but no idea on the CRI -- could be 70 or 80... might even be 90, although if it were that high I suspect they'd mention it! If it is an EasyWhite D4 then I'd certainly consider it -- 5000K and 80+CRI would be just about doable.

The A4 is indeed a bit chunky. I guess I'm after something ""large EDC"" size -- preferably under 5"" long and not much over 1"" thick. The Acebean EC35 with the Nichia emitter looks like an awesome light, but the rear clicky makes it a bit long and I've not seen any reviews or beamshots that reveal how the Nichia performs. The Acebeam EC65 is interesting, but four emitters simply make it a ""wall of light"" flashlight, which is not ideal outdoors."

I've also cycled in many big cities (London, SF, LA and now NYC) where cyclists get mown down at an alarming rate so it's not surprising that they sometimes try to take advantage of their relative agility to stay out of the way of cars and trucks -- I know I've done so to keep myself highly visible and out of trouble.

I used a white noise machine (or ""magic sleep machine"" as my better half liked to call it) when I lived in LA and has some street noise, but IMO they're only good for blocking light noise, not heavy street noise you probably get in midtown. Curtains have minimal effect in my experience, especially if you have crappy windows to start with. Good, sealed double- or triple-paned windows are really needed to mute loud city noise effectively.

Ideally what's needed is some good research before renting a place -- ie. not assuming that the noise you hear on a Sunday afternoon when you view an apartment is typical, especially if there are bars or restaurants nearby, and understanding that your perception of noise will be different when you're hustling during the day than when you're relaxed at night.

I've tried and given up on brokers before (my experience has been that they're usually well meaning but  ultimately a bit useless and unreliable), but I have had success renting nice apartments by identifying areas and then buildings that look good and then directly contacting the building superintendent to ask about available units. Landlords, both large and small, will absolutely prefer to rent directly to tenants because then they avoid having to pay broker fees, too. The application process, in my experience, is almost identical (which in NYC terms means utterly intrusive and complex).

Some listings on Streeteasy etc. will also be blissfully broker free and you deal directly with the landlord or management company. My better half and I sublet for a couple of months in the area we currently live while pounding the sidewalks and checking out apartments in about a dozen other buildings in the area, all blissfully broker free. We started off our search using brokers but very quickly realized how useless they were and gave up on them."

headphones,fd5p0sc,t3_ejwnpc,1578179855.0,"It's all getting a bit confusing with the AFO-X and Aeon 2 appearing more or less at the same time. It seems the AFO-X is a rehashed 1st Gen AFO. What exactly are the differences? Just new pads?

TBH I'm more than happy enough with my original AFO to want to spend more money trying to improve on it. The original AFC I did not like -- too flat like for my taste."
personalfinance,fd4ufhn,t3_ckfp57,1578171212.0,"Also curious when the free credit monitoring will kick in. I filed a claim a few months back (and have a claim number) and the December 19 court hearing has passed, but still heard nothing from Equifax. I presume at this stage it will perhaps kick in after the January 22 claim-filing deadline has passed. Can anyone confirm?"

And a block away from the tunnel entrance to 191st is another hillside tunnel entrance to the third deepest station -- 190th on the A line which is 140 feet under the Hudson Heights/Fort Tryon hill."
