There were fewer brain injuries simply because boxers were unwilling to hit opponents in the head; a bare fist to the skull hurt the puncher almost as much as the one punched.  Then gloves were introduced. It no longer hurt so much, so head shots rose, and brain injuries with them.

Football followed a similar path. When leather helmets were used, again, the giver of a head-to-head blow suffered as much as the taker. So they sought to make helmets safer. A similar result followed. As helmets got safer, it became easier, less painful to the hitter, to lead with the head. And again, head injuries rose."

I saw something different in this chapter. We have this sentence: ""He gravitated toward those in pain and those who wished for atonement."" When we meet Valjean, he is truly in pain, but doesn't really seem ready for atonement.

In contrast, we hearken back to the Conventionist, G__, and his invoking of Hobbes' *bellum omnium contra omnes,* the war of all against all. This seems to foreshadow the walls, literal and figurative, that Valjean encounters.

Believe me, the good Monseigneur is *almost* a main character himself. It is his initial response to, and treatment of, Valjean that, in a very real sense, allows the rest of the story to happen. If he'd happened to rob anyone but Msgr. Bienvenu, JVj would've been tossed back in jail. *FIN*"

I do have some difficulty with one piece of this chapter, though. In one sentence, we have ""Every man, *even the best* [emphasis mine] has within him a certain harshness...""
