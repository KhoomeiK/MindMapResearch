The 50-75 people that you made wait 1 or two minutes each amounts to 50 to 150minutes lost so you could gain 4 or 5. Maybe you should try leaving earlier to planning better instead of taking other people's time as your own."
videos,fc7ceuh,t1_fc7a8q7,1577503346.0,"the difference between 500 miles at 60mph and 500miles at 61mph is less than 8 minutes. Meanwhile, they are doing 61 in a 70 adding 5 minutes to the 20 people behind thems trip. It's selfish, needless, rude and illegal in many states. Honestly, I can't wait for them all to be out of work so we don't have to deal with them anymore."

The fog is either a bank in front of you that you approach and can't see into or your visual distance decreases over time as it thickens. Pay attention to what you can see and what you can't see past, that 'I didn't notice the wall of fog that I couldn't see through' is really a reason to never let that person drive again."
videos,fc7bopo,t1_fc7a8q7,1577502788.0,"Yeah, they are doing it on purpose, both them and the truck they are passing both know there is little to no speed difference between them. They could do something about it but choose not to. They should be ticketed for impeding traffic on the highway if they don't finish their pass in less than 1 mile. I have sat behind a guy trying to pass another one for over an hour while they both did 64mph in a 70mph zone."
videos,fc7ba0l,t1_fc75le8,1577502469.0,"While total accidents per mile driven and deaths per mile driven have gone down in the last 20 or so years, they continue to rise for accidents involving trucks and total number of accidents involving trucks. How this could be that drivers are getting better at everything except driving around truckers which their skill has decreased or that truckers are becoming less safe drivers in general.   


NOTE: This is not the same as truckers charged with causing the accident just the number of deaths and accidents total. Most accidents involving trucks, even single-vehicle accidents are not blamed on the trucker (oddly)."

While the government messes up, it's goal is to help. A corporation can't have that as it's primary goal, its first priority must always be a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders."

TheExpanse,fc1ptgg,t1_fc1lrok,1577325905.0,Why? As far I know (this could have changed they are surveying a lot more now) there is very very little lithium in the belt. There is far more lithium on earth but is mostly hard to get at (Like in \~10ppm of sea water)
TheExpanse,fc1ihpq,t3_efmr9z,1577319778.0,"Murry murdered Coop. Coop made a thinly veiled thread sure. Or a half-hearted warning about the dangers of the planet. Hmm, as an unbiased jury, that would be tough to decide on its own, but one thing it wasn't was a physical assault, battery, or even an attempt. At most it's a misdemeanor, if you did it today you would get a slap on the wrist and sent home in most countries. We only know one way or the other if Coop meant it because we have privileged narrator only information. Even if we knew for sure Coop had planned to hurt Murtry, the plan and veiled threat is reason to arrest not kill. Molly was under a UN charter, the UN has done away with the death penalty for crimes convicted let alone extrajudicial. There is a reason that we never hear from mudertreey again, he goes back to earth, goes to jail and dies there."
