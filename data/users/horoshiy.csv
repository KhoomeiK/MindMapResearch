depression,djkbcvi,t1_djfu3nd,1498754967.0,"My dad brainwashed me and my grandpa and grand-grandpa. Why to change something that works? 
Brainwashed are people who think that they are free but cant fall sleep at night from their insecurities. I believe in living God that helps me raise my kids just like you guys and I want to raise them full of confidence. Finding your place in the world is hard, but it is harder when you regect everything on autopilot just because somebody told you its wrong. You guys are smart enough to test things on your own. "
