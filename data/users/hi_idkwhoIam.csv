necrodancer,ffasxrt,t1_ffasrx2,1579743751.0,"The only hard part for me with Aria is her boss fight, and of course brain farts and doing something stupid. The hardest part with Aria for me is tapping when I’m supposed to, I hardly ever die from an enemy.
I still do her and monk first on All Chars because they die instantly, and that’s very annoying."
necrodancer,ffasjp9,t3_eskips,1579743494.0,"I think Bolt is harder than Aria. I usually die with Aria because of a ‘brain fart’ where I forget to tap to move/attack (usually after confusion ends), or I tap to move when I shouldn’t, such as sliding on ice. The same applies for Monk because I move into gold out of habit. However, Bolt is like 100x harder for me than Aria because you have to think twice as fast!"

LetsNotMeet,fdcysxb,t1_fdcyc33,1578288372.0,"Well now that I think about it, I started listening to Mr Nightmare when I was in 5th grade and it made me super paranoid about things, so I’d be too scared to go outside during night, and I’d be paranoid of random adult strangers trying to talk to me. I think that my dad assumed that it was me being paranoid.
I got over that paranoia when I was in the 6th grade. I still listen to Mr Nightmare too"

Breaststroke is still terrible for me, though, even though I’ve been doing competitive swimming for  about 4 years now (this is my first year in high school swim and I have the same hours as you)"
