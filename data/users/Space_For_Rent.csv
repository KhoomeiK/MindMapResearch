AskReddit,fgndtj1,t3_ezauxv,1580942750.0,"Always stay close to your opponent. If they fight a lot & you start backing up, they'll come at you & they'll probably get you down. 

If they're taller than you then you want to be as close to them as you can. Takes away their best tool: their reach. Keep your hands up and go at em. 

Also, if you're up close & you can, never underestimate the power of an elbow strike to the head. It's not often you get a perfect moment for it, it's literally cutting your reach in half, but the power behind it can do some serious damage. Won't hurt you like punching with a fist. And you can keep your guard up on your face while you throw an elbow."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fgk8emx,t3_eyw7ns,1580859711.0,"I mean, at least with Chase, the Overdraft Fee cut off is 7PM. So if you charge something after that, there's no fee if you put money in before the next 7PM. 

Also, you can always call them and ask for the fee to be removed. You get one freebee a year but, if you've been good with your finances, they'll let you do it a second time. I've been on medical for months and finances are super tight, but when I called a few weeks ago, I asked her to remove the fee since I got the money in the day after & told her my situation. I didn't even know I'd gotten a second overdraft right before Christmas, and she took off both."

gaming,fgjfmop,t1_fgjff9e,1580843027.0,"True, true. But the point still stands that consoles should push studios to put out different levels of quality games. I don't need to be able to pointlessly climb the high rise that someone spent a month rendering."
gaming,fgjezbp,t1_fgje4rp,1580842641.0,"That is *exactly* right. And what pisses me off so much about it is why they can't do both! I get having games that are visually stunning, I get suckered into them all the time, but why not push some devs to make PS2 quality full games? When you see lower quality games, they're usually indie studies & more arcade style. I don't understand why we can't have games like Sly Cooper and Ratchet & Clank. Lower quality graphics, but full games with brilliant story lines and endless replay-ability. 

Not to get political, but it is the Neoliberal model of economics that are ruining our chances to have games like that again. The concept of endless growth & always being ahead of the technology takes precedent because that's what the corporations view as a markers of success.

I had high hopes when Stadia & Steambox were just rumors because I thought they were going to fill that gap in the market. Instead they tried to compete with the PS/Xbox and became crappier versions of the same garbage"
gaming,fgjdwqd,t1_fgjdgck,1580842007.0,"The constant need of being ahead of the game is a little irritating now. I would prefer perfecting the current era, over constantly trying to move into the next one. Then, when it's Next Gen time, make those massive leaps after years spent in R&D. Who can ever forget the absolute mind-blowingness of Unreal Engine when it came out"
gaming,fgjcorl,t1_fgjam0k,1580841281.0,"True, [but even the gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d55SaCdcltQ) was a huge improvement from previous eras. The next gen (360/PS3) and every next gen since are really just a polish & additional detail (not hating, just stating as a fact), whereas PS1 to PS2 was a vast improvement in game physics & design."
gaming,fgj6adm,t3_eyrbms,1580837784.0,I don't think any evolution of gaming has been more significant than the PS1 -> PS2. You don't need to compare 1997 to 2020 to be impressed.

politics,fgj384d,t1_fgitjmg,1580836132.0,There's a reason why Iowa does a caucus AND has an obsession with being the first state to vote: every 4 years they get an outrageous amount of money spent in their state from press and candidates/volunteers.
economy,fgj2k61,t1_fgi9s7w,1580835771.0,"I'm going to assume that's what made them profitable. I prefer Youtube to every other music service. Apps like Spotify are limited. If you want underground music, or prefer listening to mixes and live sets, or enjoy covers of songs, there's no question; Youtube wins. Soundcloud could stand a fighting chance if their search bar wasn't such garbage, and didn't lock half the music on their site as unlistenable without a subscription. 

But yeah, if you don't want to pay for a subscription, there's alternatives like IosNinja, Appvalley, or Youtube Vanced (if you're an Android user)."

Venture Bros, hands down one of the most clever shows running. Boondocks is an absolute classic. Rick & Morty, Aqua Teen, even all the way back to Baby Blues & Oblongs. They've always had creative & hilarious animation. I'll just never get the appeal of the rest of it."
