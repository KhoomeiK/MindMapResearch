I thought it was leaking oil so I kept adding oil, without checking levels. Or maybe I checked the levels incorrectly. I wasn’t so good at these things. One day all that extra oil spilled out or overflowed or something into the engine and I drove down the highway billowing a huge cloud of smoke behind me. Pretty sure I fucked up traffic for a bit. It’s worth noting that this was during a seriously hard time in my life. Yeah I was an idiot 20-something, but my life was also falling apart, and I was barely functioning. I kept watching for any news stories to see if there was a big crash or anything due to my smokescreen, and I never saw anything. Fingers crossed nobody was hurt. Ps much better now."
