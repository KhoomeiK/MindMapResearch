One week I could be up all day/night crying and thinking constantly, and the next I could be in bed for a good 16 hours, wake up, eat, cry, go lie down, eventually fall asleep again. Repeat for a week in the dark and silence. I have to admit, it's not a great life and Im trying hard to change that."

depression,felfwzv,t3_eps94v,1579221233.0,"Honestly here's my story.

I worked at McDonald's from age 18 to 22. 2015 - 2019. I'm now 23 and unemployed. I quit the job to do a temporary job abroad in the summer. Came back and decided to stay unemployed for a while living of savings.

I hated working there. It was horrible. It made me feel so low and depressed constantly whilst being there. I had some fun and good happy days but 95% of the days were boring, slow, annoying and depressing. It was the 'same crap different day' thing. I worked there for what like 4 years? The first 6 months I enjoyed but after that eww.

About 30% of the workers there are people coming in and out between ages 16 and 25. People moving job to job or working whilst a student. But there are then people age 25 to 40 who are working there and not bothering about anything else. About 50% of the workers there are people who have been there for at least 5 to 15 years and going still. They do it just to affort to live and pay bills / look after family at the minimum wage.

In my opinion, that sucks. Good on them if its what they want to do but I know for sure its not what I want to do in the long-term. For now though, for someone who's short on money and/or jobless and isn't doing anything with life like studying etc then its worth just putting up with it. At least until you find yourself an opportunity for something you like in the future.

For me. I worked there for 4 years, found an career related opportunity job and applied, went for an assessment interview but sadly didn't get the job. At the same time I applied to work abroad at a summer camp for something fun and different, and got that instead so did it, had fun, enjoyed it. The way I see it. Find any job you can so you at least have something to do, but whilst working, focus on what your passion is and build up towards getting your career dream, BUT, follow opportunity if it comes around as well because you might not ever get it again.

EXAMPLE (Any Job > Opportunity > Passion):

Work at McDonalds > Get offered a promotion or find a job that pays better or that's more fun in general > Whilst doing the previous two, focus on your career dream job(s). But don't let opportunities go to waste, it may not happen again.

Good luck."
Hairloss,feku8x2,t1_feio8lp,1579207716.0,No worries. I just wished I had asked sooner myself and had someone to help me :)
Hairloss,feinxym,t3_eowrx7,1579142956.0,"Enjoy your last teen years. It looks like your receding.

Depending on your hair loss it could be a rapid progression or slow progression. Its hard to tell at a very young age.

If you want to avoid a rapid progression and want to slow it down get on Finasteride and Minoxidil when you're 18/19. Eventually, you will lose some hair or it may thin. But Finasteride will reduce the hairline receding rapidly and minoxidil will stop your hair thinning out too quick.

Eventually though, if you have Male Pattern Baldness (see your doctor / Hair Clinic Specialist), you will get to the point where your hairline will recede a lot and your hair will thin out becoming see-through to the scalp. But being on the medications will slow that down rapidly buying you until your around 25-30. By then, you can get a hair transplant if your receding hairline comes to a halt. That will then bring the hairline back down (not perfect like before, but still better than nothing). Eventually, the hair above the transplant will continue to recede if it still does at that point. You then go for another transplant to fill that up.

Some people usually go through 3 transplants after receding but in your mid - late 30s after you've had all transplants and been on medication, your hair loss MAY come to a stop but your aging cycle of hair loss will continue but thats normal because your getting older.

Either way, there's no cure and all this is doing is slowing down hair loss progression and reviving dead hairs / making weak hairs stronger until a certain age. It's better than nothing. Hope this helps.

Hairloss,fein0az,t3_eoz507,1579142333.0,"I'm 23 and your hair is like 25x better than mine lol. You look fine for your age. But if you have a family history of 'male pattern baldness' then you could eventually start thinning over time and receding. Regardless; if you really care about not losing your hair. Finasteride and Minoxidil is your answer to reduce hair loss. It doesn't stop it but it slows it down rapidly. But consider the negative side-effects of Finasteride. You only want to take it if you think you can manage the side effects if you get them, or if you have male pattern baldness because its a DHT Blocker. If your not producing rapid DHT there's no point using it. Minoxidil will increase your growing cycle of the hair to make it appear as if its thicker and faster growing, but its a pain to use and not necessary for you in my opinion as its used for people with very thin and thinning hair.

So overall I think your good for now. Eventually you'll lose hair but thats normal due to getting older."
Hairloss,feim99e,t3_epb7i1,1579141832.0,That's hard to tell. Usually Alopecia is 'bald' spots/patches on the scalp/body I believe. But from this picture it's too hard to tell. Alopecia from my knowledge is more excessive. But it could be that its the start of its excessive progression. My advice would be to go to a Hair Specialist or Doctor to get it checked out.
depression,fee31xx,t1_fecfr5z,1579025365.0,"You know, about 9 years ago (2011) when I first became depressed I thought it would get better. Then 3-4 years later (2014/15) it got worse and worse as years progressed without change. I then had multiple people tell me it would get better when I started making posts, facebook posts, messaging people etc. All of which tried to support me possitivly. It never did get better, it only got worse. Then 3 years after that (January 2018) I became super depressed to the point I wouldn't leave my bed.

Sure, I managed to get up and move on but there was no 'real or true' happiness, it was fake, pretend, lying to people acting as if I'm happy but inside I'm crying and in emotional pain. Playing games, working out / gym / exercise / work / studying etc all temporarily removed the sadness because I was kept 'busy' but once Im done with whatever I was doing thats when the pain comes back. It's like an addict taking a fix. As long as your doing something or supplied, its not AS BAD.

Then recently now 2 years later in late 2019 / 2020 here now. I look back and realized nearly a whole decade of my life has been wasted. Playing games, pretending to be happy. If I said 5-10 years ago it was going to get better and nearly 1/10th of an entire century has passed and it hasn't got better, how will the next decade go?"
depression,febwnk6,t3_enx6ff,1578963566.0,"**SHORT STORY:**

I'm 23 and I accepted my depression 2-3 weeks ago. Accepted I will never be happy and just watch TV on a loop to avoid the pain. I'm only alive for 2 reasons. Hope that one day it randomly gets better and to avoid my family going through the pain I go through, because nobody should go through this pain. My young daily life routine is;

Wake up and Cry > Eat > Attempt Workout to stay healthy in my depressed state (cry throughout sometimes) > Shower > Grab food and drink > Bed and TV until I fall asleep > Cry > Wake Up and repeat.

**LONG STORY:**

I'm 23 and super depressed and watch some of the same shows over and over on a loop start to finish with the lights off, door shut, heating on, staying in bed and l do it to trap my mind inside the show's world as if I was there myself; wishing I had that fantasy life the TV Characters have.

It removes my emotional pain whilst I'm watching it by about 90%. There are some spikes in the middle that trigger when I'm a little bored of the repeated boring scene where I wish I wasn't there but usually doesn't happen much as the shows are long and getting back to the repeated episode can take days or weeks so I usually don't get bored. But before sleep I cry and then when I wake up I cry even worse.

It's a horrible life for me. But 2-3 weeks ago I accepted my depression and I haven't smiled since. I try to stay in a healthy routine by not eating super bad and by attempting a 1 hour workout daily 6 days per week (in which I cry whilst working out...)

Anyway, distracting myself with TV makes me feel better for the duration of it but afterwards the depression is 2-3x worse than before I started watching the TV."
depression,febednn,t3_eobniz,1578957991.0,"I want to say ""It gets better"" but honestly if you're truly depressed, it doesn't get better naturally. For me personally, I try to control my depression by combing a positive thought with the current negative one and manipulating the entire emotional state with both conflicting together. In a way, it stabilizes my mood during the depressed period that's been triggered as I'm transforming a negative emotion and attempting to make it become a good one from previous experiences to give 'hope', but its only temporary and it gets harder.

My advice on your situation. If your girlfriend is causing you to feel down then end the relationship. It took me 7 years to when I finally managed to stop letting people push me around and the moment someone does they're gone without a second thought. Sometimes you have to be the villain before they become too strong, too much.

Think of it like having a man with superpowers that gets stronger everyday. The longer you wait, the more pressure and emotion will build up with your connection towards the person and it will just make your situation worse. I had a friend I knew for over 12 years, I let him make fun of me, push me around and laugh at me with others for around 7 of those years. Then I put an end to it and said bye. Honestly it was heartbreaking because when you have someone that was suppose to be a friend for that long its sad to just have them leave your life. There were good memories but you can't allow them to drag you down with emotional pain.

I then had another person I knew for about 6 months I met online when gaming. Started to follow the same paths. I allowed it once, but the second day he tried I said ""have a good life"". Blocked, muted, deleted. Haven't heard from him since and don't want to. Don't need people like that in your life."
depression,fdzslz4,t3_engzcb,1578794824.0,"I agree with missscreamer. Try different things and see what works for you. Here's a quick quote for you;

""At the end of your life, you won’t regret trying things and failing, but you will regret not ever trying at all""

I'm 23, just a year older than you and I'm in the same boat. It gets me down thinking about it so I try not to, but not thinking about it does nothing as well, so currently I'm working on a way to fix it by figuring out what I want to do and how I can achieve my goals and dreams.

Remember;

""There's always someone better than you but you are always better than someone else""

It works both ways. I've been depressed for 9 years. For 7 of those years were very progressive. The past 2 years I have managed to semi-control my depression and use it as a good thing. Manipulate it and trick your brain's  neurotransmitters chemicals to balance your emotional state. Try to do positive things and think positively after a negative thought. It's hard but if you keep trying you get better at understanding why you feel so down. Use that feeling it turn it into a positive aspect by working out what you want.

Ask yourself. Why am I depressed, what is it I want in life? Break the question down. I want X and I want X. Breakdown the answer. How can I achieve this? Etc.

&#x200B;

Here's my situation;

I'm 23, I'm unemployed and have been for 6 months. I have no money, no friends, I stay in the house nearly everyday (mostly recovering from a cosmetic operation). I never have 1 friend ask me how I am. I have 2 family members that live with me and only those two are in my area, everyone else is 300+ miles away. Oh and not to mention I went to School, College and University and did additional programmes and what for? To become unemployed in the end.

I just keep going because you have to. 'Hope' is what keeps me going. Never give up on that."
depression,fdxigie,t1_fdx7vay,1578769006.0,"Yeah I really feel you. This is why I come to the internet to talk to people I don't know about depression rather than my own friends/family because a lot of the time its easier to talk to someone else who is going through the same or similar thing as myself.

A lot of the time I feel alone too. I did a test because I really wanted to see something. I sent a message to people I have known for about 1 year and last spoke to them a few weeks ago. I sent 5 people a message. Only 2 responded.

To be honest, we have to find the people who are right for us in our lives and try to not let those types of people drag us down more than we already are."
depression,fdx6hlx,t3_en2qbu,1578765804.0,"I feel exactly the same. For 3 years the most part. There was ONE thing that changed me through temporarily and that was when I went abroad to work at a summer camp. It was different, I'd wake up, enjoy the day that's different each day and it was fun, never lonely etc. But at home. I wake up just to do nothing all day and go back to bed.

Sure I can work at a job, I can play games, I can go out and have fun every now and again but deep inside my emotion is pain. It's like your not really having fun like people think you are.

""Hi can I take your order, please. What can I get you today"" (smiles), takes payment, customer leaves \[thoughts in my head feel sad - 'ughhh'\]

\- Plays a video game, laughs and enjoys with friends, but afterwards... you feel the same.

Everything is a distraction but now its not really working anymore for me. I wake up and I can't physically go and play a game because the thoughts and emotions are too strong to care. I know this is probably not going to make you feel better or what you're looking for but honestly what gets me through the day to the next is 'Hope' that one day things can improve."
depression,fdx4t6r,t3_en7336,1578765359.0,"My experience of 9 years being depressed is that 6 and a half of those depressed years I didn't understand what it was and why but I only knew I just wanted the pain to go away. But since 2018 for the past 3 years I sort of developed the depression into something else, it's like its part of me and who I am and that I feel I need it to know what I want to be. Make sense? Probably not.

But I deeply felt depressed because I wanted to be a better person with a unique personality that stands out more - think of it like a hero from a movie. I wanted that attension that I could be that perfect happy person with a perfect life and family and friends and job etc, to not have something bad happen to me, to be seen as a good person, heroic, brave, happy. etc. But then I realised that I can't be that and it made me depressed, what gave me hope to move on is that I can 'IMPROVE' and try to be better, and I did, and it worked; sort of, for a while at least. But the other half of the depression the negitive part tells me that even if I were to acomplish that and have what I wanted, I'd still feel the same because the need never ends. I could be the person I want to be and be with the person I want to be (that inspired me of wanting to be like) but regardless, I still feel I can't be happy.

This is why I want the pain to go away so I don't feel that sadness, but I also don't want it to go away because I so badly want to feel that emotion of being 'brave, cute, heroic' or 'badass, strong, angry person' or whatever it is you want to be. Anyone get this or no? It's so complicated to explain if you don't feel the emotion and connection.

A proper example;

Imagine you're obsessed with your favorite movie character and you want to be like them (this example I'm going to use someone like David Tennant from Doctor Who) or someone you have a crush on, or your friend, or your doctor, or an army solider or whatever, but for this I'm using him as an example (but for me personally idc about this one). So he's brave, heroic, fights aliens, etc. You feel you want to be like him and say you were like him and with him, would you still be satisfied? Because the one half of your depression wants you to have that pain to 'feel that emotion' of being like them, but that won't just go away if you fullfil your needs, you want to feel that emotion? Yes? The way I see it 50% of your depression you want it to go away but successfully getting what you want, but the other 50% wants the pain to stay so you can feel the 'happiness' emotion of getting what you want. The hope of achieving it.

It's sooo difficult to explain but I hope someone gets it. Its all I can really say.

&#x200B;

Secondly. So many things make people depressed, there's tons of things for me, from my Weight, my balding Hair, my Personality, Job, Money, Lack of Friends and outgoing to the main one ""Wanting to be a better person, having a life like other happy people"" I would love to have a story/life like these TV stories like Lost In Space, The Flash, The 100, The Walking Dead, etc. by this I mean like take for example 'Lost In Space'. You're with a happy caring family (obviously have your problems) on a new planet after a crash, you survive together, you do crazy things together, you have a connection to things like robots or whatever. That emotion I feel is deeply strong. In a way it makes me happy and the other sad. Because everyone has a story, we all have one, with different people in it. But I'm inspired by so many ones that make me feel a strong connection or emotion that I would love to have a story like others. Why? I feel I'd be happy. But if I had that story, wouldn't you still feel the same? Hmm"

acting,fdooq8y,t1_fdogf2h,1578609502.0,"Thanks.

acting,fdnzbxu,t1_fdmcp1u,1578595909.0,"**Thanks for your reply and for everyone else's reply. I wanted to go into your comment further as you gave a lot of detail here.**

**Firstly. What do you class as 'being Famous'?** Do you class someone who has say 20k followers and/or has been in about 10 movies and 5 shows and say 1 show that had 3-4 seasons that was semi-popular? Or do you class someone Famous as being high up like Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, etc and people with millions of followers?

For me personally, I want to do acting because I like it and I'd be happy to be like you, an actor for 20 years 'still not famous' but if I can manage to do acting NOT as a career for a primary income, but for a career as fun because I like to become a unique character and tell good stories and be in a few movies or TV shows I'd be happy with that. Do you really HAVE to be in a show like 'Game Of Thrones' or a movie like 'Avengers' to be a successful actor? Do you really have to be famous to work as an actor and enjoy it? Sure it helps with getting jobs right? But you don't have to be famous to be successful?

&#x200B;

**Secondly, I'm asking about the whole 'being famous' thing and 'luck in the industry over talent' because I had a similar situation, below;**

So I'm 23 and studied Filmmaking and got a Degree in it, not that the degree matters, but the experience and knowledge certainly helps (training and experience). I was focused on becoming a Camera Operator at first when changed to wanting to be a Key Grip and now an Actor. Before though when I graduated, I applied to work on one of the UKs top Drama TV Soaps as a Trainee Grip. They had around 500 applications for 1 role as the Trainee!!!! Just to get a tiny bit of experience. Luckily, or maybe due to my experience working on student films I managed to be one of 29 successful people to come in for an assessment. Unfortunately, only about 3-5 get an interview if they're successful, I sadly wasn't. Then one gets the job; obviously. 

So I'm saying this because is it similar to this when it comes to landing a job as an actor for a role either if that's a short low budget film or small feature film or show or being a very high budget sci-fi TV show that could happen to become popular and end up being 10 seasons long like Arrow for example, Supernatural, Doctor Who etc? 

For my situation back with the Trainee job, I wasn't too focused about it than I should have been as I didn't 'PREPARE' for it, know the equipment, understand what everything does as I should have. After the evaluation they tell me why I didn't get the interview and it was because I sort of 'lacked interest' didn't ask questions much etc. So I get that Preparation and Enthusiasm plays a very important part as well as luck?

&#x200B;

**Now though.** I realise the importance and the effort required and I'm keen to become an actor, famous or not, I don't care. I want to do it because I like doing it, I want to have a good character development and tell a story, with my personality, with a changed personality, idk. I have to learn more and I'm willing to spend all day every day studying, praticing and doing whatever it takes to make it work. Which is why I asked the question about 'Is it Luck?'. Should I be workiing too hard or will my luck just come one day?

**Finally. Is it about the Production of the Movie/TV Show that makes your career a success in relation to being known by many casting directors/directors/producers for them to call you back for more jobs?**

By this I mean, is it about managing to land a role as a main character and it happens that the series you are doing manages to become so popular like Game of Thrones that it makes everyone in the show famous or well known to the audience and other filmmakers?

For example, the child actor Maxwell Jenkins (I'm not sure if you class him as famous). He was known for his appearance in Betrayal (the TV show) and then went into Netflix's popular reboot show ""Lost In Space"" as Will Robinson. Does that technically make him set for life for easy acting jobs in the future because of his known acting in a popular or semi-popular show? Pretend he never went into Lost In Space or Betrayal and stayed as those minor roles he did in other things, he wouldn't be able to get jobs as easily?

**So it's about how good you perform as an actor in the right productions that make you take off to land easy jobs in the future? And it's about the LUCK and PREPARATION or TIMING? I could audition and land a job in 10 small bad-rating unpopular TV shows and not be well known to get other jobs (not talking about fame to the audience) or I could be lucky to land my first paid real job on a show that is LUCKY to have good ratings and be very popular which then makes me get jobs easier? Is that how it works?**

Any examples of famous vs non-famous actors in the past?"
depression,fdnu805,t1_fdm7uem,1578592930.0,"Thanks for that. Your help, support and reply really means a lot. I mean, like; I can manage and survive my life but its just not as happy as I want it to be. It's like a 80% Sadness and 20% happiness.

I play games or watch TV or workout or do activities like going to camp as mentioned before, doing these; it distracts the depression and brings up the happiness level. It's like playing a game where what you do to the character or your pet adjusts its happiness level and mental state.

Do doing things usually makes me feel a bit better and watching funny things makes me laugh, but lately the strong-emotion and imagination pain I feel has become so deep that even when distracted like this I still can't manage to bring that happiness level back up. It's like becoming immune to something, resistant to using something. If you do something so much it no longer becomes of interest. If you manage to become resistant to a drug and it no longer works for you... It feels like that. A deep dark strong painful struggle to maintain happiness. So far, 90% of my day the past 10 days have been continuously thinking about what I want and the failures and how I can't be happy and about 2-3 times of each day I've cried. I get small spikes of 'Hope' where I'm like ""Well I could be better, I need to get up and try"" then something else in my memory drags me back down and the happiness of the hope only lasts a few minutes if that.

I'm just not sure. Life is strange, Life will move on with or without me and even I'm not dumb enough to realize that because it doesn't matter what I do or say or want or try or anything because in the end, we move forward and we have to move forward; because we can't move backwards or remain frozen.

It just happens to be that my moving forwards is set on a loop, and I need to try and change that or nothing will change."

I'm not sure if I can ever truly be happy as the person I am but the only thing I can do is try and keep going forward. It's hard, it's VERY hard to not 'feel' for a specific person or character on TV and want to be like them. It's so hard. It's like wanting yourself to be attracted to yourself.

I know that characters on TV are not what they are in real life. Like a comedian doctor in a movie wouldn't be the same in reality. They can try to be but they won't be as perfect as the scripted version because nothing is planned out as a script in real life right? You can be a cute young boy or girl or dog or animal or an old person that's heroic or innocent and like the leader that everyone looks up to but in real life you can't. Its impossible to be perfect, but I feel its not impossible to improve your own personality?

I just can't cope being the person I am, the person who gets angry for something thats funny, the person who does something stupid one day and gets laughed at. The person who gets fired wrongly. The person who never leaves the house and has no friends. No story to tell. No normal life. A life of mental illness. It's the complete opposite of what I want and if can't be happy living like that.

I feel I have to at least try and do something to change the way I am. If that is becoming an actor as a career and having a good movie to make to look back and say ""that was my story, look what I managed to achieve, I know its not real, but I managed to do the thing I wanted to do"" or if its a physical change such as moving away and starting fresh.

Whatever the reason or change, I know now that I can't be someone else especially if the person isn't what they actually are to begin with so how can I be if they aren't? I know that. But where there's failure or success, there's always room for improvement?

Can people really change, or is it how they are and will always be the same? One thing I know is that I just can't be exactly the same as the way I am because its truly not the person I want to be. I don't want to be that sad lonely angry person that grows up and has nothing good to look back on. I want to be happy, have a life, fulfill my dreams, visit places I want to see, enjoy nights with a bunch of friends, have a family, a good job, to have a STORY like other happy families have. Maybe one day I will get there, or maybe in 20 years time another reddit post will be made about how I want a life. Who knows. We can only do what we can now and move forward, not backwards."
