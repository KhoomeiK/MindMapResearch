Let her play happily among these old protectors,
prattling and lisping my name.
Let the turf not lie rough on her tender bones,
nor you, earth, weigh her down;
she was not so to you.*

Mines of Phandelvar is a great adventure, but if you plan to do only an hour weekly maybe is better if you find a short adventure, maybe something homebrewed. You may be interested in what are called ""one-shot"" adventures. They should not take more than 8 hours usually.

DnD is a game that takes a LONG time, unless the adventure was specifically thought to be short.I **STRONGLY** suggest that you take your time to study how DnD works, because it is honestly not an easy game. Yes, of course you can skip some rules in a short game and not break the game, but you still have to know what you are doing.

Another thing that I suggest you is to prep the children (and yourself!) to the idea that D&D is a roleplay game that *happens* to have monster (or people) to fight, it's not the other way around. This is why playing and adventure can take a LONG time. Absolutely nothing is setted. Your players do something stupid? your players die. Your players were asked to capture the evil wizard but they want to refuse, or hell, join the Evil Wizard? As long as they can justify it as their PG, they can totally do it. It's litterally how the game is supposed to be played.

So, take a lot of time to study this and to how to prepare your students. Don't rush thing because the children want to play next week.

I would suggest you to not have more than 6 children on a group, but in my opinion 5 is the sweet spot."

The problem the soviet and Mao had Is that Marx explicitely theorized that communism could work only in a well developed and industrialized country. Russia and China were not well developed nor industrialized.

The great leap forward and Stalin's five years plans were the attempt to Just skip the ""develop your country and industry"" phase. Technically it worked, but at a massive human Life cost. (And yes, even 1 life would have been 1 one too much).

The dictatorship of the proletariat was supposed to be a momentarily phase in order to have the time to dismantle the oppressive system, not to be the status quo."

He was elected in the Italian Senate in 2018 with the M5S but he ditched them in less than a year when they voted with the Lega (Salvini's party) a very shitty ""Security Bill"".

Yes, he was naive to accept to be elected with the M5S, but he didn't bend his moral when they asked him to vote for an inhumane law."

The reason why parties does exist is mutual support.

I'm a young man that want to do politics, I have my ideas about how things should go. I can approach the party with ideas that are more similar to mine's and I can spend years learning the ins and out of how to get my ideas done before actually running for office.

Then I actually run for office, but I have to print flyers, posters, pay for advertisement, and I have to move around to do rallies! Who is going to pay? The party. Either directly or indirectly by organizing a fundraising for me.

Without a party basically only people who already had the right connections from their parents could do politics, barring the usual special cases.

Then I get elected! I want to pass this Bill, but the are many people with ideas very different from mine that opposes me. Well, I can go to my party meeting ask them to back me up, and now I have the full support of, Idk, 50 people instead of being alone.

A party is a safety net for people with similar ideas."
explainlikeimfive,fe9npm4,t1_fe5s9q5,1578939825.0,"You misunderstood him.

In places where there is a time limit but is free to Park you are supposed to have *anything* that proves when you parked. Most people have a kinda of cardboard cloak in their car where they put the hour manually, but if you just write down the hour on a piece of paper usually is fine.

If you don't have anything to show when you parked, you are automatically fined.

At least this is in (most) of Europe.

I think that nowaday this is fading out in favor of police doing rounds with automatic license plate tracking device, because I honestly don't remember the last time I have seen a car with a cardboard cloak, while I Remember a lot of them when I was a kid."
