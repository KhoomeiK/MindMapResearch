Go on with your bad self, Marlena. Keep the customer favorite shade, - throw some shade-, and make your profit still.

On a personal note, I have panned two of these and love this color and I'm glad it's not gone!"
BeautyGuruChatter,fffihxq,t3_etcca8,1579884688.0,That very first shade is giving me flashbacks to the hardpan nightmare that was Cube in my Subculture palette and I instantly now am terrified of this palette even though I loooove reds so much.

MakeupAddiction,ffegeot,t3_et52jh,1579846996.0,"I love this look and no shade to Almay, but I never would have given them credit for that gloss not even if I had 20 guesses. It's lovely on you!"

CasualUK,fdeznel,t3_ekgix1,1578350015.0,"As an American living in the UK who knows hundreds of other Americans living in the UK... Use the local terminology, for easy of understanding benefiting both sides.
Obviously as you said, don't take on a fucking Cockney accent but utilizing proper terminology saves times and lessens cultural barriers. Be a respectful and decent human and all will go well. The only time anyone has ever said anything to me regarding my use of local terminology was a year or two ago when ordering heating oil I had to phonetically spell my name to the gent on the phone and said ""Zed"" instead of ""Z"" and he understood but expressed surprise at my use of it. We moved along, exchanged pleasantries, I paid the man for his services. The end. Don't worry about your words, worry about the level at which you speak them, I'll leave you with that."
MakeupAddiction,fdbufux,t3_ekg7di,1578262193.0,This is so gorgeous without being too much and overdone. You look like a star right off a page of a magazine!

Baking,fcz1jps,t1_fcyp2gb,1578091801.0,I do as well! And it was so lovely. I used [this recipe](https://livforcake.com/cranberry-orange-cake/) for the cake itself and it did not disappoint.

fountainpens,fc7yq93,t3_egnezy,1577522200.0,"I have found Diamine to be a middle of the road ink on low quality paper. It doesn't lean to feathering as bad as some, but it also isn't as good as some other faster drying inks or Noodlers anti feather. Also, I compensate by selecting a pen with EF or F nib to help limit the ink imparted on the page if I know I'll be working with more absorbent paper."
MilitaryWives,fb54pgx,t3_ebfsr3,1576520925.0,"Is there some reason you cannot tell him about the dog until he comes home? I feel like pending the type of deployment and contact you have that it would benefit him and cause less emotional distress and secondary resentment to know sooner, rather than later. I am coming at this from both a fellow spouses perspective as well as a mental health professional. Also, we have been in this long enough to (unfortunately) know multiple people who have had a dog pass while they were deployed and all have walked through finding out while deployed. Two of them were our very close friends that went through this in the last year and they both expressed that they were grateful to have been told in the field. Just something to consider if applicable. 

Unless he is on a no contact stent, or doing mission critical and vital procedures in which emotional processing wouldn't be something he could take on.... In that case, disregard my statement in it's entirety."
