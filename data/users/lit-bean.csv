For some reasons I even doubt that this post has written by someone who has lost a friend on that accident,, like I'm sad for all of them, I truly respect ppl who lost a family member or a friend in that crash but this SEEMS SUSPICIOUS"
offmychest,fdqat1c,t1_fdq8r78,1578661462.0,Exactly. they are faking that. like at least 150 ppl are here and claiming they have lost their friends in that ACCIDENT and they have got upvotes 😶😆 like ppl should think before they believe smth
