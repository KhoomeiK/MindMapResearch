raisedbynarcissists,fffvs2o,t3_etao8o,1579892875.0,"Yes, yes, yes! Some days it’s quieter than others but it’s always there. Have you looked into cognitive behavioral therapy? It’s different than talk therapy and teaches you how halt these thoughts. It worked for me for a while-at least 10 years—and then some stuff happened and I’ve fallen out of practice with it. It’s not something that takes long to do either. You can learn it in a few sessions."
raisedbynarcissists,ffftrmk,t3_eta856,1579891620.0,Hugs! Big hugs! I’ve been there myself many times. Please know you aren’t alone and that you are worthy of this life.
raisedbynarcissists,ffftjza,t3_et9mpi,1579891489.0,"Yup, me too. I’m the same age. It’s difficult and I feel like a freak a lot. But I do have good friends from high school (although they live out of state) and have recently decided to call them and get back in touch. There isn’t as much pressure with them as with new adult friends. I’ve been in a friendless funk the last couple of years. It’s a constant work in progress for me."

Syracuse,ff4hy02,t3_erkp1r,1579564043.0,"Daniella’s Steakhouse is really good. It’s my favorite place for a romantic dinner. Just make sure you make a reservation.  

Lemon Grass is excellent. The Pad Thai is very good. It’s hard to eat it at other places once you’ve had it there. Excellent seafood too.

I’ve been to Prime Steakhouse, which was decent though very pricey. I would expect to have one of the best meals of my life for what they charge. A lot of celebrities go there I guess. They have pictures of Bon Jovi and some other stars eating there. 

I second Francesca’s. Everything we had there was excellent. The staff was very attentive. You can’t go wrong.

I’ve also heard Scotch and Sirloin is terrific, but I’ve never been there myself. I think they require a jacket."

SuicideWatch,fcom9m8,t3_ei7ecz,1577835786.0,"I don’t come to this sub often but please don’t lose hope. I don’t know you personally, so don’t want to compare your trauma with mine but I was abused as a child, for my entire childhood. Trauma, no matter your age, impacts you as a person from that moment forward and for the rest of your life. Every day and on some days, it feels like every second of every day.

But you survived. This makes you strong and brave. I know you may not feel strong and brave but you are. You are a survivor. Have you considered how strong this makes you?"
SuicideWatch,fcolqri,t3_ei81d8,1577835410.0,"Depression can make you feel alone even in a crowd of people. One of the worst ways it works is to make you believe the dark thoughts are yours—if that makes any sense.

Weddings can be incredibly stressful. Please, please do not lose hope over this. I know how important it seems right now but your feelings are too important to not share with your fiancé. Does he/she know how you feel?"
SuicideWatch,fcokyby,t3_ei8o6e,1577834848.0,"I’ve been there, many, many times. This might sound kind of crazy but it’s a good place to be—hear me out. First, you have right to your feelings. 

Being stuck, at least for me, as horribly frustrating as it can be, can also be what makes you want to change, to fight for yourself, for your life. It’s a sign that some part of you has some fight left in you. I realize it may not feel that way at all—that’s ok. 

I think it’s super important that everyone acknowledge their feelings. Feelings can shape our reality. Feeling stuck is frustrating and if you feel it day after day it becomes exhausting, right? It did/does for me anyway. Though it may seem very difficult at this moment, you don’t have to stay this way. You can find your way back our, I promise. I did. It took years for me. Please don’t give up."

He trusted me so we all went for a walk together (he’d only let me walk him up til then). By walking him together with my husband, I think it reinforced the pack mentality. He did a 180 and let my husband walk him the next day, which was huge. He now likes my husband more than me! 

I can’t say enough about the importance of daily exercise for your beagle. Ours can be less than pleasant when he doesn’t get a least one walk a day. Walk yours everyday without fail and he will come around. Skip a day and you’ll notice his behavior change. They get restless."

You are young and beautiful and remember, even though it may feel like you are alone, you are not. You belong here. Your life has worth."
depression,fc6z7ke,t3_eghf5q,1577493309.0,"Your post sounds as if it was pulled straight from one of my journals, word for word. I’m not a therapist (and you should have one or a doctor diagnose you) but I do have major depressive disorder and what you describe are symptoms of depression.

I was born with MDD and didn’t get diagnosed until 16. It is in remission now. Antidepressants (the right one) can alleviate a lot of your symptoms, if it’s depression. 

My parents were dismissive as well, until I couldn’t get out of bed or take a shower. I couldn’t move some days. My friends were supportive at first but they were teenagers and my depression was very severe and unrelenting. It’s hard to be around someone that is miserable all the time. Many people don’t understand and don’t know how to respond. 

If you are in school (you mentioned class) make an appointment with your school counselor. Mention you want to see the crisis counselor. Read your post to the counselor or tell them how you are feeling. 

Depression can be brought on by circumstances (a breakup, abuse in the home, a death) or you can be like me and have messed up brain chemistry. 

Please know you have a right to your feelings, that these feelings, if they are depressive symptoms, do not make you any less of a person than anyone else. It is not something to be ashamed of but it is something to take seriously. And do it now, please, before it gets to where you can’t get up out of bed. Depression is one of those things that can always get worse. What you consider the worst now, if left untreated, could bring you to your knees a year from now. Finding your way out of it will become hard and harder. Good luck."
