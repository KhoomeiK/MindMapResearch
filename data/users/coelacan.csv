Bitcoin,fcatsgt,t1_fcal920,1577576463.0,"This conversation has drifted off the rails a bit, but I'll take a few more steps down this path.

You're presuming stealing/marauding are products of mental illness and show a ""failure to solve problems effectively,"" but in many cases throughout history these methods were elegant solutions to systemic issues and in some cases brought tremendous prosperity (e.g. Genghis Khan, Viking culture etc.).

What you're describing (without citation) is not neuroscience and our myriad of needs in no way relates to a computer's electrical draw. Even if I were to accept the premise that ""humans are just complex computers,"" your analogy is still broken. I'm in cryptomining and I can tell you from experience that running a server outside of factory specifications, with some knowledge, can yield desirable results.

You seem like someone who cares about the less fortunate and that's nice, but modern societal pathogens are well out of context in the brutality of the distant past.

Bitcoin,fcaaf85,t1_fca7r1z,1577565609.0,"You're operating from the presumption that people steal only for need and never greed, which is not always the case. You could also substitute ""thieves"" for a marauding neighboring tribe. They may still be attempting to ransack out of desperation, but that doesn't entitle them to the other tribe's labor does it?"
Bitcoin,fca2yop,t1_fc9ui70,1577562315.0,"It's pretty accurate. The earliest evidence of trade over great distances was nearly 20,000 years ago[1](https://books.google.ca/books?id=025dGjEwwcMC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=earliest+evidence+of+exchange+new+guinea+17,000+BCE&source=bl&ots=Lh2XXYx3xC&sig=ACfU3U1-sZcWXYscc1UZK6rjegIyA9Y6dw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjI2d2mitnmAhXWHjQIHVaiAUsQ6AEwD3oECBoQAQ#v=onepage&q=earliest%20evidence%20of%20exchange%20new%20guinea%2017%2C000%20BCE&f=false). To pre-date inter or even intra-tribal bartering you need to go back impossibly far.   


>it certainly is a primitive idea to try to take more than you need and then hold it ransom to those who do need it.

That's a bizarre characterization of the utility of exchange. Unless you're drawing-up biblical notions of a garden of Eden, surplus was maintained to stave-off famine. However, once accumulated it needed protection from thieves and an economy spirals outward from there."
