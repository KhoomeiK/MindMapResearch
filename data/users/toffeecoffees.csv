relationship_advice,fdsbpfs,t1_fdru6ig,1578698930.0,"That’s true, it doesn’t really help but it’s the most recent one I can recall since it happened today. He said that when he’s cleaning or doing something I say comments that make him think that I think he doesn’t know what he’s doing. He says that I make him feel like a 15 year old. I didn’t realize I did that. There are things that he does with leaving food in pots or pans and then putting them in the sink full of water, and we don’t have a garbage disposal, so I’ve mentioned to him multiple times to please throw the food away first before putting it in the sink and he says okay each time but then he keeps doing it. Maybe that’s what he’s referring to."
relationship_advice,fdsbgic,t1_fds5rgo,1578698765.0,"We both don’t really have any friends haha. We had friends in our old state but we moved to a new state last year and I haven’t really been able to make any good friends yet and neither has he. I know definitely I need to be on medication and therapy 100% and hopefully I’ll be getting insurance next month. He also wants to go back to therapy as well. 

I’ll talk to him again and asks why he feels like he thinks that I think he’s dumb. This is literally the only issue we’ve had in our relationship so far. Normally we communicate our feelings really well but lately it just feels like I can’t say anything without upsetting him. I have a brother here but I’m not close enough with him to warrant staying with him, I would feel way too awkward. 

I’m not sure if it’s the age difference and he suddenly feels aware of it and that’s why he feels this way suddenly. He does drink and well often smoke weed together but I haven’t noticed that causing an issue. When we smoke together we have lots of giggles and a good time, but I do worry that sometimes he self medicates with it too much. I really appreciate your comment, it gives me a lot to consider."
relationship_advice,fdrovg0,t1_fdri27r,1578687565.0,"He is, we’re both emotional people that have been through a lot before we met each other. Men are allowed to have emotions and experience things like this. I just need to understand what I can do to do better and help him understand that I’m not trying to be malicious."
fatlogic,fcyvihx,t1_fcybd04,1578087987.0,I mean they did find traces of heroin and cocaine in her system when she passed and that definitely can’t be good for the heart.
AskReddit,fcy7wxz,t3_ejdlbw,1578076023.0,"I got my first real boyfriend my freshmen year of high school. I was over the moon and absolutely adored him. We were in the halls before class and i was talking about Pokémon and he stopped me and said “could you not talk about that in public? It’s embarrassing.” We were 15 & 14 years old, how tf is that embarrassing?

When I was 18 and about to attempt suicide I called someone I thought was a good friend, I was crying and upset and he answered the phone and i said his name and was about to ask if he could talk and all he said was “oh I can’t deal with this right now” and hung up. 

Was at a party when I was 17 and was a bit overweight at the time and a friend my best friend was seeing told me that I have a cute face but I’d be cuter if i lost weight. 

A friend i dated briefly while I was 17 told me that he only wanted to date me after hearing a rumor that i put out."

Your appearance won’t change besides a lil food baby :)"

tipofmytongue,fc7m5fa,t3_egmwow,1577511964.0,"I also remember one of their album covers being white with the word Girls written on it, and they had another album cover that was a soft pink. I’ve tried looking up the band The Girls but it was not them."
agedlikemilk,fbcspk6,t1_fbbixob,1576732613.0,"I mean if we think about it on a smaller scale and say this is a friend group and one friend suddenly accuses another friend of doing some terrible shit, the third friend in the group is gonna be grossed out and probably lash out at the accused friend. I feel like a lot of people have been their and when they hear the full story they’re like “oh my bad”. It’s just different when it’s drawn out to this larger scale. It’s dumb, petty drama that is completely irrelevant in life."
