AskReddit,fgfsf97,t3_exvrzj,1580746573.0,"In middle school one of our assistant principals was a power hungry dick. He would suspend kids for a week if they didn’t have a hall pass, forge student signatures saying we were informed of detention (just to suspend us for not going), etc. It was hard to stand him from the way he talked down to everyone to the way he would intentionally stand in doorways just to not let people through (forcing them to take another exit). Those were my 6th and 7th grade years. 8th grade, I get some kid (6th grade) in my band class who happens to have the same last name. Ends up, he and his sister were transferred to our school because they’re principal dickhead’s kids. The son is cool and we all figure the dad is a dick to him too. A few weeks down the road we all find out he’s been telling the dad what’s going on when teachers/administration isn’t around, basically snitching. At the same time we find out, this kid’s sister completely changes her attitude and starts acting like she’s too good for anybody, starts the usual “my dad is the principal” and “you wouldn’t understand, you’re too poor” kind of attitude (at a very low income school). Now, all the students had always noticed and for years had rumors that principal dickhead was jerking off in an empty science classroom storage room during that teacher’s off period. I end up getting suspended for the principal’s scheme and then told by the daughter the same day something along the lines of “Don’t worry, it’s just what happens to hood rats.” I was pissed. I ended up sneaking a note into the courtesy’s stack of papers when I got back from suspension. It was a fake note from the dad to his kids to meet him in the science storage room to help him move things. I ended up finding some reason to take longer than needed in the office because I wanted to be near the classroom when the kids either got in trouble or caught their dad in the act. Well... they caught him in the act alright. He was having an affair with the science teacher who was about half his age in the store room. The kids had to go to therapy, the principal got divorced and lost his job, the science teacher got some huge severance package and left the district. I never told anybody I was the one who did it though.

Make a list of things you’d need to do every day no matter what to be successful. An example would be; make 50 cold calls, call 10 existing customers, send 20 emails, sell 3 products. When that becomes doable every day with time to spare, add to it. Continue to do this until that list becomes law for you and you learn to push unimportant things out of the way."

Then the behavior score is always “highly varied.” Why even have a behavior score then? Why did I work toward a 10k behavior score then?

AskReddit,ffu5pzf,t3_ev5zdg,1580235053.0,"About 2 months ago. I was driving myself crazy studying about 12hrs/day for a university physics class (one of my last courses). I felt so dumb because I went to an exam and did so bad I left halfway through the exam and texted my professor “I feel like I’m wasting your and my time, I’m sorry but I won’t be taking the final, I have another class I need to focus on.” He was actually helping me regularly and I was doing everything but the exams were something else. My drive home should only take about 8 minutes but I didn’t get home for 45 minutes. I cried in the car, I went to a gas station for stress eating food, cried at the gas station, then went home and when my wife gave me a hug I cried again. I think I scared her but I explained everything and apologized (We’re trying to move on with our lives to have kids and me failing a class would push that all over), she reassured me it was ok and we’d figure it out. She said we would hire a tutor if we needed to or whatever else we needed. I felt horrible.

Just two weeks ago I checked my grades just to see what happened with my other course. To by surprise, I got a B in the physics course. I check the course online page and there’s an explanation. Only 3 students made it through the course past halfway. Out of 40-something originally. He couldn’t give us all A’s so he gave us grades respective to our ranks."
legaladvice,ffsjuxd,t1_ffsjms7,1580183487.0,"He’s never had to have credit, his dad paid for everything until he died. I know it’s a high risk loan but that’s also why I’m asking for the property as collateral."
legaladvice,ffsh2wi,t1_ffsfx6t,1580181540.0,"That’s part of it all, the loan is small(less than 10k USD) but his condo is also not worth much (maybe 50-60kUSD). He doesn’t have an existing mortgage but the discrepancy of how much would be loaned vs. the property value concerns me in that a judge could say the debt to value ratio is way far off. I told him already to expect me to take action if necessary and he knows I want the property so he has little expectation of me just letting the loan go so that’s not an issue."

Why are we getting “highly varied” behavior score matches? Why would I even care to keep my score up if I’m going to just get stuck with people who have names like “Wings of Racism” and “Hitler was right” and do things like go afk in ancient box just because someone took tome? These last updates make me want to quit Dota honestly.
