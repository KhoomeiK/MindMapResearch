She loves her dad to death, but she only gets to see him a few times a year. I've only met him once in the 4 years my girlfriend and I have been together. He became a Jehovah's Witness when he met his new wife (who my GF loves), so I didn't know what to expect. He seemed like just a regular guy (duh because he is), but for such a big guy, he had the weakest handshake.

tl;dr My girlfriend's dad has a handshake like a limp, dead fish."
