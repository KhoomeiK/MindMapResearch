> Most life insurance companies declined the extreme climber altogether in our survey. One that didn’t decline quoted a monthly rate of $779.63. Another life insurance company said it would charge a rate of $153.45 per month if future climbs are 20,000 feet or lower in elevation or $603.45 per month for climbs that are 20,001 to 25,000 feet in elevation. If the extreme climber wants to go above 25,000 feet — such as the 29,029-foot-high Mount Everest — he’s unlikely to be able to buy a term life insurance policy at all.


It says most insurance companies apparently just don't offer insurance coverage. I wouldn't insure someone who will be walking by dead bodies."

PeopleBeingJerks,fcac4nl,t1_fca9lo4,1577566537.0,"I live in the US. People here can buy injury insurance, but that's to protect yourself in case you get injured. But you pay into that yourself. There is no requirement for any person to have liability insurance. You only need liability insurance for motor vehicles. 

Let's say I am broke and have no money. I then throw a rock through your window and injure you. You can sue me until you're blue in the face, but if I have no money nor job, you're out of luck. You could then have me tossed in jail I guess. And that could ruin my life and future. But you're not getting any money from me.  Period. 

Can you name the kind of insurance that would allow you to sue it because of my actions as an individual? Maybe they have those where you live. Tell me, what's the nname of the insurance YOU have that would pay someone else in the event they injure you? Also, where do you live that has this?"
