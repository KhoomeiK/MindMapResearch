1. Slovenia. Specifically Lake Bled, hire a bike and bike up to the National park, its a beautiful ride and an absolutely gorgeous park, hire a boat and go to the casle island in the middle, absolutely worth it. 
2. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Absolutely stunning country with some beautiful mountains, Mostar was my favourite place by far. 
3. Ukraine, go to Kiev and explore the wonderful and extremely cheap city and also go to chernobyl for a fascinating trip you will never forget 
4. Iceland. This is fast gaining popularity but still underrated, dont even know where to begin, between the lovely people and the absolutely incredible scenery, waterfalls, glaciers, beaches, the northern lights. Go in the winter AND again in the summer. but VERY expensive, take your own food, avoid alcohol, oh and go to the secret lagoon rather than the touristy one 
5. North Maceonia, especially if you are a history, culture fan. SO much history here but also lots and lots of gorgeous scenery, very cheap aswell."
