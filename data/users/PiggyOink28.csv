If you get inspired but you’re busy, write the idea down somewhere, and come back to it when you’ve finished whatever you’re doing. Don’t just sit scratching your head because you feel like you have to write a certain amount each day. Even if you only add a sentence one day, at least you’re a sentence closer to finishing."

writing,fftzgfh,t3_ev77sr,1580231101.0,"For writing essays about the effect of writing my English teacher taught me PEZZL:           
P= point. Make a statement about whatever you’re writing about.                   
E=evidence. Use a quote from a text.                                  
Z= zoom in. Pick one word from the quote and point it out.                       
Z= zoom out. Explain why that word is important and what effect it has.                   
L= link. Explain what something would mean in the real world (e.g if the author says the charcter has a very pale face, that might mean they’re sick or in pain).                       
A template for this type of essay would be:                    
(Author’s name)’s use of language has an interesting effect on the reader (your point). In the text, it says (insert quote) (your evidence). The use of the word (one word from the quote) (zoomed in) suggests (whatever it suggests) (zoomed out). Generally (specific word) means (what it means). Using this information, the reader can infer that (something they an infer.) (link).            

For other essays, there is PEE:
P=point
E=evidence
E=explain

Hopefully this helps."
