Besides it's such a stupid thing to make a big deal out of. What matters is that you two get along, respect, make eachother happy and all that good stuff. Not your bodies. That is such toxic behavior on their part. I wouldn't necessarily say he needs to stop talking to them (although i personally would if they were trash talking me like that) but setting healthy BOUNDARIES good. So in this case ask for them to drop the nasty commentary or kindly gtfa. You shouldn't have to fear loosing someone you care for because they rather listen to someone who is being hurtful to them. That stunts your growth as a couple. Anyway hope this helps. Sending love your way!"
