Please tell me how you actually justify someone being blamed for trying to get emotional support from a parent who raised them and was with them basically their whole life??  Are you really trying to police how people get support?

insanepeoplefacebook,fga6lou,t1_fga4owa,1580647382.0,Same with oil of oregano. But careful how much you use or you'll smell like pizza for a week. I also use it to kill ear mites in dogs (it works really well) and in a very very veeeryyy diluted amount with coconut oil to brush my dogs teeth occasionally. He had the worst stank breath and it works wonders.

TrueOffMyChest,fg7z2m6,t1_fg7yswr,1580605180.0,Someone else who compared being anorexic to being transgender.
TrueOffMyChest,fg7z0qk,t1_fg7xsbc,1580605139.0,"With anorexia people think they are overweight and don't want to be. They want to be ""skinny"" and it harms their health. With a trans person, they know deep down from a young age that they are the wrong gender and they don't want to be the gender they were born as which is harming their health. They WANT to be the gender they feel like.

Anorexia means they want to harm themselves because they see something that isn't there. Transgender means they want to feel better because they don't see something that they want to see. 

Not the same."
