depression,fdoce5x,t3_emfcl8,1578602618.0,"Good job, I am so happy for you. You will do great and I wish the best for you :)"
depression,fdobh9q,t3_ememb2,1578602175.0,"Sorry about that maybe you can talk to a guidance counselor and just tell them to not tell your parents. Maybe one day you can talk to them, and hopefully they will be helpful. But all I can do is say, you can do it just keep on chugging through and one day it will get better."
depression,fdob6a3,t3_emegns,1578602026.0,"It isn’t your fault, sometimes you make mistakes. You aren’t doing anything wrong. If you need to take some time away from your friends and spend some on yourself, or you could even ask them or a family member or therapist for help. I don’t know everything and I’m not a therapist but I do sincerely hope you feel better. You are fantastic <3 just remember to take things slowly if necessary."
depression,fdoag3i,t3_ememb2,1578601670.0,"Sorry to hear about that, but I don’t think killing yourself is the best thing to do, therapy could help even if you have bad social skills a therapist will listen and try to help. Try getting more active as exercise can help with depression, or maybe just talk to a family member. Even the smallest of leaps could help. I sincerely hope you feel better, best of luck <3"
depression,fdoa1qy,t3_ememxw,1578601472.0,"Sorry to hear about this, don’t know how much I could help since I do not have a family, but try to sit down with your wife and talk about how you feel, as for your kids. That’s a hard one but try not to yell at them as it can hurt their self esteem and such ( speaking from experience from my dad) but if time permits and you have enough funds, maybe go see a therapist it may help with everything going on, and they will probably give better advice than me. But I wish you luck and I hope everything goes well. <3 you are amazing"
depression,fdo9asu,t3_emep7e,1578601115.0,"Sorry to hear that, the only advice I could offer is to try new hobbies and who knows maybe you will talk to someone and make a new friend. I hope everything turns out amazing, best of luck <3"
depression,fdo91hd,t3_emephz,1578600984.0,"Sorry to hear about that, personally I would be impressed to see someone solve a cube that fast since I cannot. I hope it lessens, and you know what those people don’t matter and it would be best to ignore them even though that is nearly impossible sometimes. I hope everything gets better, best of luck <3"
depression,fdo8onn,t3_emesni,1578600812.0,"Sorry to hear about that, I have no idea what else to say."
depression,fdo8gqc,t3_emet3q,1578600704.0,"Good job, you should definitely be proud of yourself for stepping out of your comfort zone to have a chance of feeling better. You are very brave and I wish you the best of luck and you will do great. <3"
depression,fdo809d,t3_emevy4,1578600482.0,"Thank you for writing this and trying to find new hobbies. It’s hard at times, but what matters is that you’re trying, and that is amazing. I hope it gets better, and I hope you find someone. Best of luck <3"
depression,fdo7fjw,t3_emewr4,1578600198.0,If you felt that they were hurting you it was probably for the better. Hope you feel better. <3
depression,fdo77sz,t3_emexyz,1578600093.0,"Go for the trip if you believe if will help you feel better. It will suck if you miss school but it is just one day, do what makes you happy and never give up. You may lose those friends in the future but you will make new ones. Good luck and hope school goes well. <3"
teenagers,fdnz0px,t1_fdnug93,1578595729.0,I heard something about it not too sure tho
depression,fdmcos0,t3_em4l64,1578545700.0,"That really sucks, I doubt I can provide much help, but I know what it feels like to want to be away from your family, and what it feels like when they judge you. All I can really say in terms of support is that you are an amazing person, who will get better someday, even if it takes time, you will get through this. Hope this helps a bit."
depression,fdmc5vq,t3_em3hcy,1578545265.0,"You are not a failure to anyone. You are going through something very tough and I don’t think I’m qualified enough to help much, but do things in your own pace and just take time to breathe. It can be hard to get out of bed at times, but you gotta keep pushing so that one day you will feel better. You are amazing."
