Costco,ff3ecms,t3_erft19,1579539354.0,You'd think it will be easy for Costco to pull up your purchase history and cross reference the SKU for the appropriate info. Good luck with your search!

Frostpunk,fesmcj3,t1_fes93qt,1579366753.0,I hear ya. Suggest if you play again maybe set up an Outpost at Tesla city and you'll get 1 steamcore a day. If you get there early enough you'll have a ton of automatons running your whole city pretty much and you can keep your people in their homes where they'll be warm.
Frostpunk,fer8vzn,t3_eqfgb9,1579351293.0,Only the one automaton? You made that much harder on yourself. Nice job.

personalfinance,fc30y3l,t3_efx7zc,1577378947.0,"You'll find the IRS very happy and willing to make arrangements if you touch base with them. My recollection is you have 10 years from the tax year of default to pay them via a plan, so if that's correct you'd make manageable payments as long as you pay off your debt to them by 2025. Call them. You'll  fee a lot better once you do so."
