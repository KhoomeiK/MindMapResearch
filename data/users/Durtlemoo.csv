lifesucks,fcmdyku,t1_fafuo46,1577771817.0,My mom was never happy with my dad. She felt the same way that you do with your husband. And then she left him and found the perfect man for her. Don't be in a relationship you aren't happy with. Or maybe go to counseling.  Do whatever you have to do to be happy.
lifesucks,fcmdmga,t3_e8t69m,1577771506.0,"Honestly, what I see most people do when someone is shitty in their life like your mom, is that they just kick them out of it. You don't need people like that. Learn not to give a single fuck about what other people think. And your kids? They'll see later on in life what a great mom you are and really appreciate you and everything you've done for them. Your husband? Talk to him...maybe go to counseling if needed. Honey, listen to me. You are amazing. You are a great mother and great wife. Do not let the negative things bring you down. Keep your head up. Keep trying. Do not give up. And remember...nobody controls your happiness but you. You got this! I believe in you! Be the best you that you can be."
