hockeyplayers,ff7t4ma,t1_ff7mfai,1579657720.0,That’s fair.  I probably didn’t give it as much emphasis since it’s much easier to learn than the skating half.  So maybe that’s the amount of effort more than it is the importance of each.
hockeyplayers,ff6gdfo,t3_erhlhz,1579626613.0,"If you know how to skate well, you should be able to accomplish it with oversized skates.  I'm sure if you put a seasoned player in oversized skates, they'd have no issue doing it.  If you're learning how to do something that you've never done before, you're gonna have a hard time doing something like that.  

So yeah, it's probably possible, but you're skating around in oversized skates so you've probably got a whole lot of technique issues across the board and not just related to stopping.  I bet the quality of your edges is weak, your strides need work, etc."
hockeyplayers,ff6g16m,t3_err7gq,1579626401.0,"I honestly think it's more about how you play than what you wear.  We have a weak skater with white gloves...nobody chirps him, probably because he's not a threat and he doesn't play dirty, keeps quiet.  Then on another team we have a super strong player who wears a tinted visor and already draws a ton of attention to himself, yeah people can't shut up about it.  

White cuff is fine but it's gonna get gross and yellow pretty fast, that'd be the only reason I'd pick another color."

hockeyplayers,ff1svtv,t1_ff1pfiy,1579485437.0,"I definitely find that the people that ""have to be on the best team"" are usually the guys that I don't want to play with, personality wise.  In the league I currently play with, my team is somewhere in the middle.  But the team that's almost always in dead last?  That team is FULL and always has a full bench.  They're some of the most fun people I know, and if I needed a team I'd ask to join in a heartbeat.  

Meanwhile the team that went undefeated two seasons ago, had a player kicked out and all of a sudden had to drop to a lower league because they couldn't retain their players. Imagine that!"

hockeyplayers,ff0f92m,t3_er1081,1579468286.0,"There's definitely a HUGE difference, in my experience, in the ""put together"" teams versus the teams that are formed by players.   Even some of the player formed teams at the early levels have this problem as newer players try to figure out where to be.  It's just personalities clashing and you end up on teams with people you'd NEVER voluntarily play with when given the choice.  

I've had some of the ugliest fights take place on the benches of formed teams like you're describing.  People squabbling over ice time, position, getting mad at others for how they play.  It definitely is ridiculous but I can promise you it does get better.  One time a guy got into an argument with me about shift length since I'd asked him to shorten his, and another guy came over and shoved the guy (kinda white knighting, I was the only girl) and they started fighting on our own bench.  Refs didn't know what to do.    Needless to say, that was the last season with that team. 

Nothing is better than finding the right team for you.  It probably won't be the first one you join.  It took me a couple tries before I found my forever team.  My team is competitive BUT we're fine when we lose.  We understand when people have bad days and we talk about issues instead of yelling in the heat of the moment about someone hogging the ice."

hockeyplayers,fepba35,t1_femxovx,1579316335.0,"I tell adults to go 5/8 until they learn how to stop and can confidently shave the ice with both feet consistently and evenly.  Then immediately go back to 1/2 (unless that adult weighs 300 lbs, then go ahead and stay at 5/8).  She MAY have trouble with edgework if you go less sharp, but not necessarily.  Usually when they can't stop well, they aren't exactly edge masters either.  

5/8 for stopping is kinda like training wheels for a bike.  You can definitely learn without them it's just a little bit harder."

hockeyplayers,feklt0a,t1_fekkgqa,1579202716.0,"Yes, I got the little sparx figure skate adapter. You have to play around with it a bit to get it on the right place of a larger toe pick so that the sharpener doesn’t Nick it and the skate has to go in backwards compared to a hockey skate."

hockeyplayers,fek448y,t3_epe4w1,1579192198.0,"We have one at our house and we love it. 2 pairs of hockey skates and 1 pair of figure skates that regularly get sharpened by it and you just can’t beat the convenience or consistency. We NEVER have to worry about an uneven sharpen or anything weird. Our skates always feel just right.  I’ve never assumed that it was cost effective for us, even with all the skates we have, but the only good sharpener in town is like a 30 minute drive so maybe by the time you factor in time and gas, it is.   

Note, over time the sharpener did affect the radius of the figure skates (how round the blade is) so once a year I take them to the professional to have him fix it (it does it in a way that is fixable thankfully).  I haven’t noticed this in Hockey skates but I have to wonder if it isn’t doing the exact same thing, or maybe it’s because it’s built for rounder hockey skates that it does this.  Doesn’t matter, still worth it and I still use it on both.  Not an issue I’m sure any of you care about, but maybe if you have a kid that figure skates as well, something to be aware of since there’s like no information out there about this."
hockeyplayers,fek3jhl,t3_epfsil,1579191852.0,"Sorry to say but the best way to handle this is going to be to make that drive and try them on.  Pretty much everyone starting out ends up in the wrong size or model skates. It’s almost a rite of passage.   Skates are your most important piece of equipment.  This isn’t to say that you can’t skate in bad or poor fitting skates, but you might not be able to overcome the issues with skating ability and it may affect how you learn. 

Don’t blindly trust the Bauer scanner either, try on what they recommend but only you will be able to tell what fits you.  I wear an entire size down from what the scanner recommends to me.  

Insoles like superfeet are often recommended by people but they’re $50.  The good news is that you’re in almost the right size skate, you can move the insoles to whatever skates you end up getting.   You do have to cut them to size so if you’re in the wrong size skate, you could burn through a pair.  I like superfeet for cheaper skates, but higher end skates you may not need them."

BabyBumps,fe4x9vs,t3_enpkh5,1578863668.0,"I had sickness until 15 weeks 5 days, so a little into my second trimester.  I was also terrified it would last my whole pregnancy since it didn't ease up at all when the second trimester began.  The first trimester was HORRIBLE.  Fuck being pregnant.  It's awful, truly awful.  I lost 15 pounds my first trimester because I couldn't eat and everything made me sick.  Just thinking about food made me sick and I always had a horrible taste in my mouth.   Anytime I would read about the ""joy of being pregnant"" I wanted to punch someone.  I think they're all fucking liars. I can't even IMAGINE the women who are doing this while working a full time job or more...I'm sooooo amazed by them.  I was completely nonfunctional for weeks on end.  

My first few weeks I survived on apples peanut butter cheese and crackers.  After awhile I lived on Smoothie King.  Then there were a few days of pickles and popcorn, a few days of cheetos.  I made my husband change his soap and cologne.    There was a day early on that I burst into tears and started googling how to end things early because I thought there was no way I could do this, I was desperate.   Thought I was feeling okay one day and had a steak and was miserable for the next 36 hours until it was out of my system.  

Unisom and b6 taken together at night helped me.  Sea bands helped a little.  Taking my prenatals right before bed also helped.  But I would say that life definitely was awful during that period, even with these things which only take the edge off.

I'm 17 weeks now and things are much better.  I'm not completely back to normal but I'm able to eat better now.  I'm able to have actual meals and eat actual healthy food.  I've limited my meat and dairy and the baby seems to prefer that. My eating habits are radically different from pre pregnancy.  I felt different, more normal, the day my morning sickness went away.  Took it easy at first, eating bland pasta and rice dishes and that worked out okay.  I still eat WAY less quantity than I used to, and I feel like its because my stomach doesn't have as much room as it used to...almost like I had a form of weight loss surgery restricting my stomach capacity.  If I eat too much in one sitting, I definitely get indigestion or heartburn.  My more-pregnant friend said that her indigestion and heartburn got worse during her third trimester so I'm trying to prepare myself for that.  

So I guess what I'm saying...YEAH...this sucks.  The beginning is the fucking worst.  I'm doing much better now than I was...life was hell from 7 weeks to 15 weeks.  But you'll get through it."
BabyBumps,fe4v4o6,t3_enrkj8,1578863098.0,"100% get it.  Your baby can't get protection from those things when it is born anywhere else BUT you getting the shot while pregnant.  Same goes for the flu shot.  You'll pass some immunity on to the baby and help protect it until it's able to get the shots later on.

Your husband should get them too, and you should limit access to the baby to those who haven't had those shots, but I would say those are of lesser importance than you getting them."

instantpot,fdex5h9,t3_el0nq8,1578348463.0,"No.  You'd be pushing the limits in a regular sized IP with that much.  But given that you're in a dorm, I'd still go with that size and just do multiple batches. It cooks quick it won't be that much of a hassle."

stepparents,fdevmu5,t3_ekve8j,1578347540.0,"You'll really need to observe his particular EOWE life tbh before forming too much of an idea about it.  There are SOOO many different kinds of arrangements.  I've been in an EOWE situation with only a single child for a few years now...and I'm a disengaged stepparent.  My SO as long as I've known him has taken the approach of ""Oh I barely have him any time at all so I can't teach him / enforce rules / etc"".    It seems like in this very thread there are different approaches to that though...so it really comes down to how this guy is with his kids.  Does he use those days to try and just be their buddy or does he embrace his parenting role 100%?  Is he too tired after his long work schedule to engage much with the kids?  These are things you'll have to see in action.  

I couldn't see my situation at first, I wasn't a parent and didn't get it.  I stepped back because it didn't seem like any parenting was happening on the weekends when he was around (not that any is happening at the BM's house either).  I tried at first and it was like beating my head against a wall.  I guess I'm in the situation you're envisioning and calling a dealbreaker and I totally get it.  It's frustrating.  On the flip side, it's really not a huge part of my life so it wasn't enough to affect my relationship.  Like you, I loved the man so much...this was just part of the package.  Our life is great.  When it's one of those weekends, there's always some tension but lately we just sort of treat it as their time and my time."
stepparents,fdeueo1,t3_ekr44o,1578346813.0,"Nobody will teach SS14 anything and I'm always the evil stepmonster for suggesting that someone teach him something so that MAYBE someday when he's 47 he might be able to fend for himself.   Yesterday we're at a restaurant and he's trying to cut his waffle.  So he's stabbing at it with a knife in one hand (fork nowhere to be seen) and when this obviously fails, he tries to get away with using his hands.  He has some mild dysgraphia but literally just hasn't been taught to cut his own food.  (When he couldn't tie his shoes at 13, guess what...forcing him to wear lace up shoes for 2 weeks one summer solved that problem..he IS capable of learning things)  When I first came into the picture and we went to Olive Garden one night..he started eating his noodles with his fingers.  Literally sauce splashing all over this face and hair while doing this (he was 11). It was absurd.  So at my urging/glaring, DH gives him a 2 second lesson which clearly isn't enough or remotely thorough enough and he manages to rip off one more bite and then decides he's done with his meal.  (He's not, he's just mad he can't eat it with his hands).

Why do his bio parents not teach him anything or work with him on these basic life skills?  Do they want him to be completely dependent on other people forever?"

I know how to cook but I'm just too lazy to do it often.   But with the pot...I think I've cooked like...4 out of the past 7 days and eaten leftovers on most of those other days?   LIFE CHANGER!  My favorite part is that by the time I'm done making lunch today..the kitchen is super clean instead of covered with a mess! 

(I got a little too bold yesterday and tried to wing it and ended up with a soupy mess, lol.  I gotta watch my liquid to pasta ratios more carefully when I'm winging it)"

It's never going to be ""fair"" which name is given, but both should be considered and discussed."

I think it was day 2 of school and all the upperclassmen started taking people off campus to lunch.  All of a sudden I looked around and realized I was one of 3 freshman girls left sitting there, when the other 20+ had gone off somewhere. 


Thankfully I figured it out and found new, less cool, friends soon after.  Briefly a “goth” only my mom wouldn’t let me wear all black so I wore a black skirt that had flowers on it lmao.  Eventually found my nerd friends."

Just make sure that you are squeaky clean when you make the move to living with them...it's different than if you're just spending time with them.  If there's anything that might be considered dangerous or inappropriate for a kid, make sure it's locked up and that they don't have access to it.  

IANAL so just make sure your SO talks to his lawyer so that you're ahead of anything."
