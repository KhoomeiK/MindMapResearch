The same thing applies to skills. If you live in a place or time period where new clothing is expensive, it makes sense to learn to sew. if you can just buy a new shirt for $10, it's not as important to sew. Your time is better spent on developing other skills (e.g., cooking).

Transportation works the same way. Driving is very important for some people, but it's not very important for others. If you live in a big city like New York, Boston, San Francisco, or Chicago, you rarely need to drive. Even in smaller cities like Pittsburgh or Milwaukee it can be cheaper to just take Ubers and public transportation than to pay for parking. 80% of Americans live in urban areas, so this applies to many people.

Driving is going to become even less useful in the future. We are on the cusp of self-driving cars. Public transportation is going to become even more cost effective over time. And the price/convenience of ride sharing apps is significant. It costs a ton of money to buy a car, pay for parking, insurance, maintenance, etc., only to keep it parked 23 hours a day.

So driving is a skill that is rapidly becoming obsolete. It's going to be up there with horseback riding in a few decades. If you have a car now and you need it regularly, it makes sense to train your kid in using one. But if you are one of the many people who no longer own a car, it's not important.

As a final point, it's not very hard to learn to drive a car as an adult. They can always learn later on their own."

The only people who vote in primaries are the far left and the far right. So candidates tend to be more extreme. Then when the general election rolls around, the candidates tend to move towards the center. Granted, Trump didn't move to the center, but maybe Bernie will. 

If you don't think he will compromise in order to win, you can always vote for someone else. If the Biden/Bloomberg types are too moderate/conservative for you, and you think that the Bernie and Warren types are too progressive to win, you can vote for Yang or Buttigieg, who split the difference between the progressive and moderate wings of the party.

The only way for the Democrats win is if everyone allies behind a single candidate. So far it seems unlikely because the Sanders camp despises Biden, and vice versa. Hillary Clinton said nobody likes Sanders, but she was really only talking about Republicans and moderate Republicans. Either the progressives have to switch to Biden, the moderates have to switch to Sanders, or everyone has to settle for someone in between like Buttigieg. The big question is whether Democrats hate Trump enough to settle."

> I support sending aid to foreign countries who need it, but that's not the same as a mandate to provide for those countries.

Foreign aid implies the US has money and is giving it to foreign countries. In the case of these multinational corporations, they aren't based anywhere in particular. They have offices everywhere. If they are incorporated in the US, it's usually in Delaware, regardless of what city they are typically associated with.

> This is the fundamental issue, there is no wealth redistribution, it's used for infrastructure and social programs. To your point, where ever microsoft operates, they get taxed. If you open a store in Germany you'll pay Germany taxes. This is about Bill Gates' personal capital gains, not Microsofts. I'm sorry but all of this is super ignorant.

Wherever Microsoft operates, it gets taxed. The parts of Microsoft based in Germany are taxed according to Germany. The parts of Microsoft that are in the US are taxed in the US. But now, the goal is to tax Microsoft's entire business in the US, not just the American parts. If the goal is to use it on infrastructure and social programs, why not use it on toilets for the hundreds of millions of people who don't have them? Or on vaccines for people who can't afford those? Or elementary school for people who can't afford it? If your goal is to maximize quality of life for humans, it makes sense to start with the low hanging fruit before giving people extra things. 

In the case of Gates, he could easily move to Singapore, Monaco, London, the Bahamas, etc. But if he does, I'm not sure any of those countries have any claim to his wealth simply because he has citizenship there. And if that applies to them, it should apply to the US as well. Keep in mind that Gates has paid taxes on income already. Now we are talking about a new tax on his existing wealth.

> Does Sanders oppose foreign aid?

It's not a question of ""foreign aid."" A multinational corporation's money doesn't belong to a given country. It belongs to humans around the world. A decade ago, an ""Indian"" car company called Tata Motors bought Land Rover and Jaguar from Ford. It manufactures those cars in Brazil, China, India, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. Jaguar and Land Rover are incorporated in the UK, and the company that owns that company is incorporated in Singapore, and the company that owns that company is incorporated in India. The idea of foreign aid you are describing is if the UK government taxes Jaguar and Land Rover, and then gives the money to the Indian government as foreign aid. It's not their money in the first place.

Oh I know because you've made up a bunch of nonsense, and that's really what it is in ever sense of the word. It doesn't make sense in the least.

I'd agree with you that this stuff is confusing and doesn't often make sense. It requires learning dry details about international law, economics, and business. The legal organization of multinational corporations isn't exactly beach reading. But it hits at the strange nature of globalization, and what makes Sanders's tax plan so unlikely to be effective. It's very easy for a corporation to reincorporate in a tax haven or for a billionaire to relocate their primary residence. The US has benefited from the fact that the richest people in the world have often chosen to make the US their home. But if the taxes in the US become much higher than in another country it's likely that they'll just leave. Just as much as Sanders wants to keep out poor people, he wants to retain rich ones. But it's easier to block people from entering the US than it is to tell an American citizen they aren't allowed to leave."
changemyview,fgqkibp,t1_fgq8ccy,1581025943.0,"> This is from 2012 but based on an average US minimum wage of 7.25 an hour (which it was then) and 40 hour work weeks that is 15000 ish v the ILO figure of 18000 pa. This would clearly not put them in the top 16% of people globally by $ PPP but slightly under average. The data used for this is granted flawed and has gaps but in terms of actual waged positions this is probably not far off.

I think the data is fine for what it is, but it doesn't capture the point I'm making here because of the flaws you mentioned. It only works for salaried employees in a white market. So 90% of American workers are included, but 75% of Indian workers are excluded. India has a population of 1.34 billion humans, so that's a ton of people. This dynamic applies to all developed vs. developing countries. That means the data is inherently weighted towards the high end because it excludes billions of workers in poor countries who aren't being tracked. 

Furthermore, if you look at the 25% of salaried Indian workers who are included, they will tend to be the highest salaries in the country. Only large, competent businesses are able to pay salaries to workers. Small scale enterprises generally don't have the accounting practices in place to be able to do so. They just pay cash ""under the table"" which is why this is called the grey market/black market/informal economy. It's not that they are trying to hide anything, it's just that they don't have the education or fintech infrastructure to pay a salary the way a formal business does. As such, only the top businesses are able to pay salaries, and they tend to pay the most money in a given developing country. So wages are artificially inflated there.

There are a few other flaws/gaps in the study. For example, Nigeria has 190 million people, but is excluded, which raises the overall average salary. The authors of the study made these limitations clear, and it's why you can't apply that metric to the argument I'm making. It's interesting, but it's not quite what I'm talking about here.

I don't think Sanders has changed his view. He's been very consistent in what he believes. A fundamental part of a socialist economic system requires excluding poor foreigners from entering into the system. The more people that enter, the more people you have to share the redistributed wealth with.

The key thing about Sanders is that while he is in favor of closing the border and restricting immigration, he's not interested in locking kids in cages. Not helping people is not the same as actively hurting them. And because Trump is so extreme, it has [enabled Democrats to sidestep internal debates.](https://www.vox.com/2019/7/29/6741801/2020-democrat-presidential-immigration-debate) Sanders can say he is simply going to reverse everything Trump has done and it seems relatively pro-immigrant by comparison.

Bill Gates happens to live in Seattle. He's decided to donate his fortune to help people who are dying of malaria in Africa. If Sanders taxes Gates, much of that money would instead go to the US government and be spent on Americans.

The logic is that Microsoft is a global company that makes most of its revenue from outside the US. It happens to have it's HQ in Redmond, WA but it's truly a global company. If we are going to redistribute it's wealth, who gets it? One arbitrary border is the city of Redmond, WA. So does everyone in Redmond get the money? Why not the people in King County? Why not everyone in the state of Washington? Why not everyone in the United States? Why not everyone in North America. Why not everyone on Earth? Why not only the poorest people on Earth?

What makes the people of the US more deserving of Gates's money than impoverished people of Africa, South America, or Asia? I suppose you could use arguments based on race, religion, nationality, etc. Trump has defined his special group based on arbitrary factors that he favors, and Sanders has defined his based on different factors. But both have a special group who gets to benefit, and hundreds of millions of Americans, and billions of people around the world who are excluded.

You could say that's just how countries work, but it's not a requirement. For every Trump, Sanders, Modi, Netanyahu, Putin, Johnson, Xi, etc. who is looking out for their special group above others, there's a Trudeau, Macron, Merkel, Obama, etc. who are looking out for everyone.

So despite all the rhetoric, Bernie Sanders is taking from the top 0.1% and giving it to the top 1%. In any case, there is someone who is going to pay and someone who is going to benefit. It's not best from a neutral perspective. So the question just comes down to whether you are part of the group that will benefit or the group that will be harmed. The downside to his position from a neutral perspective is that while it shifts around relative wealth, it will lower long term economic growth overall (absolute wealth)."
changemyview,fgq4gmh,t3_ezxddv,1581017689.0,"I'd agree with you, but it depends on why they've set up their HQs or homes in that region. Many multinational corporations choose to set up their HQs in the US (Delaware in particular) because it has very clearly written laws, fast and reliable courts, enforcement of contracts, limited political risk, etc. These things are byproducts of the work that the citizens of a given country contribute.

Citizens should charge as much as possible for providing that service the same way anyone should charge for their services according to the laws of supply and demand. So say the tax rate in a given area is 20%, but it offers efficient legal infrastructure. The company can also choose to go to a place with a tax rate of 10% that offers worse infrastructure. The people in the 20% area should charge as much as they can before the company chooses to relocate. If the company doesn't leave at a 25% tax rate, but would leave at a 26% tax rate, then that 25% represents how much they value the legal infrastructure of a given region.

The only catch is that now many countries around the world are building better legal infrastructure. As the supply of suitable HQs for multinational corporations increases, the amount of tax revenue any given city can extract is going to decline. The supply of global cities is generally thought to be greater than the supply of billion dollar corporations. So the amount of money a given city can charge is going to decline. But in any case, it's still a function of supply and demand the same as any other good or service.

PS: When I say legal infrastructure, I mean all the intangible benefits of being in a given region including access to labor, ease of getting investments, reliability of accounting practices, etc. When I used the 10% vs. 20% tax rate example, it's not just about tax rates.

To put this in context, recognize that both Trump and Sanders are populists. The idea isn't to create a fair system and improve things for everyone. The goal is to find an evil group to demonize, and to redistribute that group's wealth to their own base. In Trump's case, the villains are coastal liberals, brown people (e.g., Mexicans, Muslims), black people on welfare, etc. These people are punished under Trump's plans, and their wealth (or would be wealth) is redistributed to coal workers, factory workers in swing states, farmers, conservative white men, etc. In Sanders's case, the evil people are upper class people and boomers (people who get most of their income from their lifetime of saving for retirement by investing in Wall Street), and their wealth must be redistributed to younger progressives in the form of student loan payoffs, healthcare, etc.

Sanders wants to help his base as much as Trump, but he also excludes many people. For example, Sanders wants to tax billionaires. But he doesn't want to share the wealth with the hundreds of millions of people who live on $2 a day. He instead wants to give it to Americans and ban others from entering the country. He's said that the [US can't have open borders because poor people will come from all over the world.](https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-open-borders-poverty-world-immigration-1388767) His goal is to redistribute money to his working class American base, not people who are exponentially poorer.

Sanders and Trump don't do this. They are already born and know they are part of a certain team. As such, they are trying to stack the deck in favor of their side. If you are a conservative white guy, you have to support Trump because he will take from others and give to you. If you have $50,000 in student loans, you have to vote for Sanders because he will take $50,000 from taxpayers and give it to you.

The same logic applies to the idea of a flat earth. The actual belief isn't a big deal. But if someone doesn't have the critical thinking skills  to see that the Earth is round, it's a big deal.

These extra skills enable people to see that the Earth is round.

Some people just accept the Earth is round because that's what they are told. This is the lowest level of thinking. Some people learn just enough skepticism to not believe what they are told and instead trust what they can observe (that the Earth looks flat). These people are smarter than the first group and often end up as flat Earthers.

Right now schools and society don't teach it as well as they should, which is why so many people end up as flat Earthers. But as this type of education improves, so will the prospects for humanity.

This is similar to the Veterans Affairs system in the US where the US government directly owns the VA hospitals and directly employs the staff.

But other socialized, single-payer health systems in the US (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare) are not vertically integrated. Taxpayers pay for these programs, then the government pays independant hospital systems. Then the hospital systems (hospitals and doctors) spend the money however they want (according to the terms of their contracts). If you sue for malpractice, the hospital is liable, not Medicare or Medicaid.

So in the case of the NHS, the taxpayer is the owner, the worker, and the customer. In the US models, the taxpayer is just the customer. The independant hospital system is the owner and worker. Taxpayers can choose to give them their money or not. The same applies to private health insurance."

Is the vegan responsible for the death of the cow used in that hamburger? You could say yes, but it's very indirect.

The same logic applies to health insurance (socialized or not). You are paying a health insurance company to pay for any care that a doctor deems necessary. The doctor makes the decision. You are just paying for your piece of the care.

The vegan's choice was to buy a vegan sandwich. From then on, they have no authority over what the sandwich maker spends their money on. The insurance buyer or taxpayer's choice is to pay for the expertise of a physician. From then on, they have no authority nor responsibility over what the physician spends the money on.

Both of these deals could be structured differently. The vegan can say they only will buy the sandwich if the sandwich maker doesn't spend the money on meat. Insurance buyers can say they will only pay for insurance if the physician agrees to act in a certain way. But the sandwich maker and physician can refuse to take the deal. Then the vegan gets no sandwich and the insurance buyer gets no healthcare. Physicians (i.e., the American Medical Association) have very adamantly said that they won't tolerate anyone getting in the way of the doctor-patient relationship. 

So it's an all or nothing question. You can become a doctor yourself and do what you want, you can go without formal health insurance, or you can sign the deal where you give the doctor money in exchange for them taking care of you, but you don't have control over how they spend your money. There's way more people who need medical care than there are doctors, so doctors have the power to dictate terms.

1. 14% of the US population consists of immigrants (meaning the last decade or two. Most Americans were originally immigrants from the last century or two.)
2. Only 13% of the immigrants to the US come from Canada or Europe. The rest come primarily from developing countries in South Asia, East Asia, Central America, South America, etc.
3. Since the Trump administration entered office, there has been a decline in the total number of immigrants as a percentage of the total population.

Belgium:

1. Only a small percentage of immigrants to Belgium came from developing countries (e.g., Morocco, the Democratic Republic of Congo). The rest primarily came from wealthy countries, most of which are EU member states (e.g., Italy, France, the Netherlands). [Source.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Belgium#Ethnic_groups)

That's the difference I'm trying to highlight here. Rich countries are happy to allow people from rich countries to immigrate. Poor countries are also happy to allow people from rich countries to immigrate. But rich countries generally don't like allowing people from poor countries to immigrate. The US is the exception. It's a rich country that allows many people from poor countries to immigrate.

The reason is because of the incentives involved with sharing wealth. Say there is $1000 in a country and 100 people. That averages out to $10 per person. Now say you allow in 10 more rich people. That means there is now $1100 divided over $110 people. So everyone ends up with $10 as before. This is largely what Belgium does today.

But say you allow in 10 poor people. That means there's still only about $1000, but it's divided over 110 people. That means each person only gets about $9. This is a short term hit. The catch is that in the long term, the extra poor people will be able to help grow the economy. But it takes time (decades/generations), and individuals don't live that long. Voters don't like this, and tend to avoid doing it.

Now say you are the US. You have a minimal social safety net and allow in immigrants. So there's $1000 split over 100 people. Each person gets $10. Now 10 poor people immigrate. The people before still get $10 because the $1000 is still split over 100 people. The new immigrants don't get any socialized benefits. But they get access to new infrastructure, investments, jobs, legal institutions, etc. So they come out ahead. And in the long term, the $1000 will grow, which benefits the original population. In this way, the incentive is to allow in more immigrants, which leads to greater economic efficiency in the long term.

This isn't being handled well in the US today, but the long term strategy from decades/centuries past was sound. It resulted in the US becoming the richest and most powerful country in the world. Now the US is starting to take on more of a slow-growth declining superpower European model. 

The underlying idea is that when it feels like there is ample growth opportunity, the goal is to recruit more people to help attain the new wealth. It's like if a hunter-gatherer discovers an enormous orchard of unplucked fruit. It makes sense to get more people to help pluck it. On the flipside, when it feels like there is less opportunity on the horizon, people try to get the biggest piece of the existing wealth. It's like there's very little fruit available. If a hunter-gatherer finds one tree, it makes sense to keep it secret and only share it with their family instead of other tribes.

The question is whether you think the US and world has a ton of room for growth or not. For some pockets of developed countries, it seems like there is little room for expansion. If you work for a fossil fuel company or in a developed world factory, then your prospects are dwindling. If you work in tech, then the sky's the limit. In the long term, the rate of innovation suggests that there is ample room for growth, but people haven't adapted yet. It's like when factories were first created. The Luddites thought there was little room for long term growth, but factory workers saw significant opportunity. The factory workers turned out to be right."
changemyview,fgnvzmt,t3_ezk417,1580954098.0,"> The US has a population of 350 million people. 350 million is more or less 30 times the population of Belgium, but they have at least 1000 times the budget of Belgium.

The US is far richer than Belgium because it has traditionally been the most immigrant friendly country in the world. It's inconvenient and unpleasant to move to a new country where you don't speak the language. So the only reason to do it is if you can make far more money in the new place. As a result, the most motivated and productive people moved to the US. They invented things, started businesses, and grew the economy greatly. So a big part of the US's economic growth is because it allows in many people from around the world.

The catch with Belgium is that it's a small country that doesn't allow many immigrants to enter. The reason why is because the more immigrants that come, the more people they have to share their social system with (including healthcare). As a result, it doesn't have more people to share with, but it doesn't experience the same growth as the US (the US's economic growth rate is double that of Belgium).

So if the US adopts a socialized healthcare system, the broader strategy is to block immigrants from entering. If you look at politicians like Bernie Sanders, they are very anti-immigrant, pro-tariff, etc. (obviously not compared to Trump, but compared to most mainstream Democrats). If the US doesn't adopt a socialized healthcare system, the strategy is to allow more people in because they end up paying more taxes than they take out. As a real life example, paying for socialized healthcare for immigrants is the biggest reason why the UK left the EU (David Cameron has discussed it in various interviews).

So that's the tradeoff. If the US adopts a socialized healthcare system, it will result in restrictions on immigration, and a slowing of long term economic growth. Many Europeans countries have a ton of money left over from the days of colonialism so they are set. Belgium took a ton of money from places like Congo, invested it locally, and is now using that money to fund socialized healthcare for ethnic Belgians. But they aren't accepting foreigners.

As a final point, healthcare costs what it costs. Any strategy that socialized healthcare uses to lower the cost of care can also be done without socialized healthcare. The question is about who should pay for it. Socialized healthcare is more about a redistribution of wealth than an intense focus on business efficiency. Sanders and Warren are more known for wanting to tax upper class Americans and give the money to lower class Americans than they are known for a passion for healthcare administration."

You have the right to respect or disrespect anyone you want. So you are free to think that the concept of trans is bad and use whatever terminology you want to refer to a trans person. You don't have to give them respect.

But other people also have those rights. So a trans person can think you are a bigot for holding those views. They can think you are a bad person for not calling them by the name they choose. They can choose not to give you respect.

The catch is that it's not just trans people who think the second way. Many non-trans people think that way too. For whatever reason, the vast majority of society has decided to side with the trans perspective and think that you are the bad person here. It's not just the US. Majorities in Europe, China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, etc. also feel this way. They have the right to their own thoughts, and the right to say that your thoughts are wrong.

You are trying to create an equivalence here. You're saying that trans people want you to ""respect their pronouns,"" and you want them to respect your right not to use their pronouns. But the catch is that no one has to respect anyone. You have no obligation to respect them, which means that no one else has to respect your view to ""identify them as their biological gender."" Ironically, you've adopted the same flawed logic in your title that you're accusing trans people of using.

But there is another way of looking at this, and it revolves around the idea of ""should."" What should people do when encountering someone they disagree with? What are the highest level principles here? I'd say that calling a trans person by their preferred pronoun costs nothing and makes them extremely happy. Meanwhile, respecting your view makes trans people feel bad and doesn't help you much. So to maximize happiness in society, it makes sense to just call them whatever they want.

You could say that there is objective scientific truth underlying this stuff. But the underlying biology is far more complex than simply using the terminology XX or XY. There are a bunch of chromosomal variations (e.g., XO, XXY, XXX). There are many circumstances where an XY person looks and acts like an XX person (e.g., they have testosterone, but the testosterone receptor doesn't work so it's as if they don't have any testosterone at all). There are also many variations in the brain that people don't understand yet that might explain gay people, trans people, etc.

You can call these variations diseases if you want, but they exist and affect millions of people. So we need to come up with some way of deal with it. Disease isn't really the right term because if you have a disease you are unhappy about it. You die of cancer on an deserted island. Meanwhile, gay and trans people are happy about it unless someone else makes them feel badly about it. If you are on a deserted island as a trans person, nothing else will happen to you. But say it's a disease. Then the principle is that it's not a nice thing to make fun of people with a disease. Any way we look at it, it favors supporting trans people."

changemyview,fgnm0q5,t3_ezilkh,1580947757.0,"Buttiegeg was considered the fourth place candidate nationally, so his strong showing in Iowa bodes well for his candidacy. He was just an unknown small town mayor until recently. Most Americans don't know how to pronounce his name, and I still don't know how to spell it. So the fact that he did well in Iowa has an underdog story going for it. Plus, it implies that his problem is that people have never heard of him, not that they don't like him.

Meanwhile, Biden and Sanders are the two heavyweights. Both have been national level career politicians for decades and both have run for president before. If Biden and Sanders don't win, it implies that they are actively disliked by certain voting blocs because everyone has already heard of them. So basically, when a relative unknown ties with an A-tier candidate, it's a big deal. 

Also, before this year, the rules were to just report the national delegates. If that were the case, then Sanders would have been seen as tied with Buttiegeg. But after the 2016 Sanders and Clinton battle, Sanders pushed the state to change the rules and report all figures. The idea was that a progressive like Sanders would get more votes in college towns and cities, so showing the raw votes and state delegate equivalents would look better for him. Meanwhile, more moderate candidates usually win the rural areas so simply reporting the national delegates as tradition dictated would look better for them. 

Ironically, this benefited Buttiegeg because though he would have considered to be tied with the old reporting rules, he is considered the winner under the new ones that Sanders pushed through. As of the most recent figures, Pete is tied in national delegates with Bernie. But he's winning in the extra figures (raw votes and state delegate equivalents). That's the big shocker and is why he's currently considered the winning candidate. Not all results are in yet, so it's possible that Sanders might beat him in the end.

My guess is that this app snafu is going to ultimately benefit Biden and Sanders and hurt Buttigeg. Buttiegeg was strongest in Iowa so the inconclusive nature of this possible win is going to hurt him. Meanwhile, Sanders is strongest in New Hampshire (which is right next to his home state of Vermont), and Biden is strongest in South Carolina and Nevada. Iowa's delegates aren't particularly important, but this is a crucial time for donations.

As a final point, the shakeup of the candidates is that Sanders is the most progressive, Warren is next, Buttiegeg is next after that, and then Biden is aiming a bit more moderate. We can also put Klobuchar and Bloomberg in the more moderate zone. Yang is something a bit different, so I'm not sure where to put him. Buttiegeg is banking on being relatively progressive policy wise, but being able to use his military and McKinsey background to win over moderate Republicans who don't like Trump. The idea is that those people would actively vote for Trump over Sanders or Warren, but would pick Buttiegeg over Trump (or simply not vote). So the other big surprise is that Buttiegeg appealed to a wide range of the state. Sanders and Warren did well where you'd expect them to (e.g., progressive college towns), but Buttiegeg did equally well in more progressive and more moderate places. Of course, [his biggest problem is that he's gay.](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/iowa-caucusgoer-pulls-buttigieg-vote-after-learning-he-s-gay-n1130696) So we'll see how that plays out, especially in more conservative states."
changemyview,fgni7x7,t1_fgnfglu,1580945424.0,"It's a metaphor for urgency and importance of a given problem. No food is a problem, but no oxygen is a much bigger problem. You have to solve the no oxygen problem first before addressing the no food problem. This metaphor is easy to understand because you are a human being. You can remember times when you were hungry, thirsty, and you held your breath underwater. Putting yourself in the shoes of a pro-life person is harder, but that's what's required to understand why your argument doesn't work.

Pro-life people think that poverty, rape, and infanticide are all problems. But solving the abortion aka infanticide problem is priority number 1. Infanticide is inherently a bigger problem than rape or poverty. It's an even bigger problem than the murder of adults. So telling someone who is concerned about a genocide against innocent infants to instead focus on solving serious, but lesser problems isn't convincing.

Plus, state sanctioned infanticide is relatively easy to fix. If you elect the right politicians, and put the right people on the Supreme Court, you can make abortion illegal and solve the entire problem. It's just a choice people make. You can win it by being persuasive and politically organized. Meanwhile, rape and poverty are much tougher problems to solve. You can't solve them simply by talking and changing some rules.

Even if abortion is made illegal, it will still happen. But it would be considered a crime. And it's much worse if a legitimate government does something horrible than if an illegitimate terrorist organization does it. Not in terms of lives lost, but in terms of what it means for everyone else in society. If a terrorist organization from your town kills innocent people, it's a tragedy. If your democratically elected government kills the same innocent people, it's a tragedy that *you are partially responsible for.*

Again, to understand why your argument doesn't work, you really need to think about it from a pro-life perspective. Your argument requires pro-life people to accept that abortion is here to stay and try to mitigate its harm. So it depends on who the ""we"" is in your title. If you mean pro-choice people, it makes sense. Then ""we"" pro-choice people need to force pro-life people to adopt our position and move onto the next set of problem (e.g., rape, poverty). But if you mean ""we"" as in society as a whole, you are including many pro-life people who aren't willing to sacrifice their position. From their point of view, they absolutely need to keep the abortion conversation laser focused on the central problem of state sanctioned (or even sponsored) infanticide."

The US economy is better than ever. Unemployment is extremely low, wages are rapidly rising, the stock market is hitting record heights, formerly impoverished countries like China and India are also becoming richer and are buying products from the US. Trump tried to take credit for this in his State of the Union address last night, but this trend has been happening since 2009, so Obama and even Bush deserve most of the credit.

But say that things are really getting worse over time. If that's the case, then tomorrow is going to be worse than today. So if you don't think you are ready to have a kid, tomorrow will be worse, and you'll be even less ready to have a kid. So having the kid now is the better choice.

Obviously, personal circumstances matter a great deal more than systemic circumstances. If you are 14 years old, you should wait. If you are about to start grad school, it makes sense to wait until the most intense years are over first. But from a broader economic perspective, now is a fine time to have a kid.

As a final point, the US does have affordable childcare, college tuition, housing, and infrastructure relative to what billions of people live with around the world. The handful of small developed countries that have better versions of this stuff (e.g., Japan, parts of Europe) have even lower birth rates.

The best way to tell who is winning is to look at who the other Democratic candidates think are winning in the debates. The best debate strategy is a bit like Mario Kart's blue shell. Everyone attacks the person in the lead. You don't want to waste time taking out a low polling candidate because they will be forced to drop out eventually, and if you're nice to them, you might be able to get their supporters to switch to you.

That poll leader was Biden for a long time, but in November/December, Buttiegeg started to surge/take the lead in the Iowa Polls. So Biden was the main punching bag for months, but once everyone realized Buttigieg was winning, they started to go after him. So that's the simplest way to recognize that Pete was a major candidate.

The reason why this is surprising is because Pete Buttigieg isn't a famous national candidate yet. He was just the mayor of a small town in Indiana who is now running for President. No one has heard of him. Most people can't pronounce his name. I had to look up how to spell it just now, and I'm still not sure. Meanwhile, everyone has heard of the other top candidates like Biden and Sanders because they've both been famous national level politicians for decades who have both run for president in the past. Buttiegeg focused on advertising himself only in Iowa. So everyone in Iowa knew who he was. In this way, Biden and Sanders are trying to get people who have already formed an opinion to change it. Buttiegeg is just trying to raise awareness of his existence. 

But fortunately for Buttiegeg, when Democrats hear about him, they tend to like him. He's a gay guy with progressive policies (compared to Obama. Next to far left candidates like Sanders he's Mussolini). For the moderates Democrats and liberal Republicans, he's a Christian military vet who was a Rhodes Scholar and worked at McKinsey. He's farther left than Biden, but still appeals to Republicans who don't like Trump. His case is centered on the idea that if Sanders won, those Wall Street type Republicans would vote for Trump because he's the less of two evils, or the devil they know. But if Buttiegeg won, those people might choose not to vote, or even vote for Buttiegeg.

For example, Van Halen used to enter into million dollar contracts to perform at various venues. Their ""weird ask"" was to have a bowl of M&M's in the dressing room with all the brown ones removed. If they showed up at a venue and this request wasn't met, they'd exit the contract per the pre-negotiated terms. They'd refuse to play, which would cost the venue hundreds of thousands of dollars in ticket sales.

They had an interesting reason for why they asked this (you should Google it), but it's irrelevant. The simple thing is that they entered into a contract with very specific rules. The venue did not have to sign the contract. They could just shake hands and go their separate ways. But the venue signed the contract, which means they were bound to it.

The same thing applies to cheating. Most people have put a ""cheating clause"" in their marriage contracts. If one partner cheats, the other partner has the option to end the marriage and walk away with sometimes billions of dollars. Fair or not is irrelevant. Big deal or not is irrelevant. All that matters is that the agreed upon contract was violated.

But here's the twist. 84% of Google's revenue (about $116 billion) comes from Google Search. That's essentially the same search engine that Page and Brin put their labor and thought into creating in 1999. So 99,998 workers generated $20 billion in revenue last year, and 2 workers (Page and Brin) generated $58 billion each.

The same sort of thing applies to Amazon. Bezos doesn't deliver the packages himself. There are many companies that deliver packages.

AskReddit,fgh3cx2,t1_fggveln,1580775723.0,"Smarts, grit, and determination are only three of the factors that matter. Others we've discussed include the right idea, the right timing, execution, persuasiveness, and willingness to take on risk. And like I said before, millions of people have a few of these qualities, but very few people have all of them. 

Beyond that, there is a major element of luck. You have to be born in a society where you can actually take advantage of these qualities and build something that helps others. If you were born in a country that was ravaged by colonialism or otherwise has a restrictive government structure, you won't be able to achieve anything. In the 20th century, the world was divided in to a first world, a second world, and a third world. The people born into first world capitalist countries had many opportunities available. The people born into second world communist countries and third world colonized countries had no opportunities. Plus, even in first world countries, you had to be a white man to really have a shot. As Warren Buffet puts it:

> “I mean, Charlie — when we were born the odds were over 30-to-1 against being born in the United States, you know? Just winning that portion of the lottery, enormous plus,”

But once you are in that unique category of top status person in a rich country, the luck part fades out in favor of the other qualities above. Kobe Bryant was amazing at basketball because he was a tall, muscular man. But everyone in the NBA is a tall, muscular man. He had to do other things to set himself apart, such as spending more time practicing, more time watching game films, more time refining his style of play, etc.

So someone else could have been a billionaire. Someone else could be a NBA superstar. Luck matters a lot. But it's not like a lottery ticket. In the lottery, you have to work for an hour to get enough money to buy a lottery ticket. The work comes first, then it's luck. In the case of what these entrepreneurs did, they won the lottery first. They were born as white men in a stable capitalist country. Then they used their talent and effort to build something. The lottery ticket was just the price of admission. The work came afterwards. The same went for Kobe. He was born a tall, muscular man. The work came afterwards.

This website irritates me somewhat because it's filled with people who won the lottery part, but spent their lives earning Reddit Karma instead of building something new (I have 100k+ meaningless internet points so I'm in this boat too). Then the complaint is that those tech billionaires didn't earn what they accomplished, and with just a little bit of luck they could have been Bezos.

This further hints at the idea that their money should be redistributed. If someone just won the lottery, then they don't really ""deserve"" it the same was as anyone else. But then the goal isn't to redistribute it to the billions of people who didn't win the lottery (e.g., they were born in a slum in Rio or Mumbai). It's to redistribute that money and status to themselves. I appreciate the OP for being one of the few people to examine what it would be like to redistribute Bezos money to all of humanity instead of just taxing it and giving it to the 5% of humanity that lives in the US.

In any case, if someone is smart, gritty, and determined, but is restricted in their opportunities because of the genetic lottery (e.g., they were born in a country without freedom), then that's a big problem. But it annoys me to hear people who had the same or better opportunities as Bezos (or Musk or any of these other people) discount his effort. I'm not saying that applies to you, but it's very common on this website. It's a mentality that hangs over people's lives like an albatross."

All that's left is three guitars and a drum set. You can sell them for $10,000.

Say that a couple is happily married. Then the husband and wife are forcibly separated and imprisoned. The husband is then tortured, and the wife is raped. Who is worse off? I'd say that the fair comparison isn't the tortured husband against the raped wife. It would be to a circumstance where they weren't separated, imprisoned, tortured, or raped in the first place.

So say there are a group of Africans. Some were forced to get on a boat and be slaves in European colonies in the New World.

It wasn't just the violence. It was the separation that made things horrible. In the husband wife example, if they were seperated but not tortured/raped, they were still separated. Together they could have had companionship, children, and a happy life. But because they were seperated, they weren't able to accomplish the same things. At a societal level, if a big chunk of the population is separated and taken elsewhere, neither side can accomplish as much as they could have accomplished if they weren't seperated in the first place.

As a final point, we are using Africans as an example here, but the same thing applies to many other groups that endured genocide, slavery, and colonialism. In the case of the Holocaust, the Nazis who did it didn't leave their home country. They did [their atrocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mass_Grave_at_Bergen-Belsen_concentration_camp_-_Fritz_Klein_-_IWM_BU4260.jpg
) locally. Meanwhile, the English were so focused on beating the Germans, they took took every bit of food they could get out of India and created their own [atrocity.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/90/Dead_or_dying_children_on_a_Calcutta_street_%28The_Statesman_22_August_1943%29.jpg)

> You can also demonstrate to me in some way that African-Americans would be better off returning to those nations in some way, if you believe to the contrary of my view.

This is a ""white seperatist"" argument that says that black people would be better off in their lands and white people would be better off in their own land. But the problem is that an African and and African-American are no longer the same people, even if they can trace their family lineage to the same region. Black Americans are Americans, just like any other American. In Castaway, when Tom Hanks's character went home, he realized his wife had moved on. He wasn't her husband anymore. They were different people. The same logic applies in my husband wife example above (because they were seperated for decades), and the African and African-American example (because they were seperated for centuries). 

More importantly, the entire world is mixing together. So now people from South America can go to North America, North Americans can go to Asia, Asians can go to Africa, etc. The old boundaries are dying because people can fly to the other side of the planet in a few hours, and talk online in real time. And instead of people solely going to other parts of the world to steal, kill, rape, etc., nowadays, people are starting to go to help, build, marry, etc."
changemyview,fggbrvp,t3_eybg5j,1580758520.0,"About 44% of American households pay $0 in federal income tax. Many people in this group also receive government benefits such as Medicaid today, and would receive other benefits such as college education under Sanders tomorrow. This means there are already hundreds of millions of people who pay taxes for decades for government benefits they will never receive. That's the whole idea behind progressive taxation and a socialist economic system as a whole. Richer people pay more taxes than they get in benefits, and poorer people get more benefits than they pay in taxes. So pointing out that some people will pay taxes for 4 years before receiving a benefit is misguided. The whole idea is to set up a system where rich people will always pay for things they never benefit from, and poor people will always withdraw from the system that they they never pay into.

This is a bit confusing for people because most people (Democrats and Republicans included) don't understand the difference between welfare and entitlements. Plus, it's confusing because Medicare is an entitlement program, Medicaid is a welfare program, and Medicare-for-all is often advertised as an entitlement program, but it's really a welfare program.

**Entitlement program:**

Say you go to a coffee shop, and you buy the person in front of you a coffee. Then the person behind you buys you a coffee. Then they person behind them buys them a coffee. That's how Medicare and Social Security work. A portion of your wages are taken out of your check and given to elderly people on Social Security and Medicare today. The idea is that in the future, you will be old and can't work so you won't pay into those systems. But some young person who is in good health will pay a portion of their wages to cover you. You are entitled to this money regardless of how rich you are because you paid into it over your lifetime. So a billionaire gets Social Security and Medicare the same as anyone else. The idea behind fairness comes because everyone has to pay at some point and everyone benefits at some point.

**Welfare program:**

Say a homeless guy is sitting on the corner outside. You go to a coffee shop and buy him a sandwich. You never expect him to pay you back. You also never expect anyone else to give you a free sandwich in the same way either. The idea behind fairness is that you are rich and you want to help someone who is poor. Medicaid and Medicare-for-all work this way.

So someone paying an extra 4 years of taxes for a benefit they won't receive isn't a flaw in this plan. It's the whole idea behind it. There isn't enough money to fund Medicare for all simply by taxing billionaires, even at 100%. So the money has to come from somewhere. If you directly raise taxes on people, they tend to be unhappy. But if you just allow some people to pay 4 extra years of taxes without getting benefits, they tend not to notice or mind as much. This is the basis of Jean-Baptiste Colbert's classic quote from 17th century France:

> The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to procure the largest quantity of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing.

In this way, you are realizing that you are in line at the coffee shop. You paid for the person in front of you to get coffee. But now instead of someone paying for your coffee, you are paying for your own coffee, and the person behind you too. Sooner or later, the richest people who walk into the coffee shop after you will start paying for the coffee of the poorer people behind them. But you are in a strange transition time. But that's what it takes to be part of a socialist revolution. Like a game of musical chairs, someone has to be standing when the music stops. That's what it takes to end the game and switch to a new one. It's not a bug, it's a feature."

In all your examples, other people besides the state can do them. For example, farmers can grow and sell food even if the government doesn't give them corn subsidies. Meanwhile, only the state is allowed to use violence. If anyone else illegitimately uses violence, they can be killed by the state. If anyone else, legitimately uses violence, they are a separate state.

In this way, a state could spend 100% of its money on military spending, and it would be a state. But if it spent 0% of it's spending on military and police, it wouldn't be one.

I think all humans are equal. I think it's wrong to say that some humans are special based on race, religion, nationality, etc. I can understand inequality if one person does a lot more good in the world than someone else (e.g, a doctor does more valuable work than a fast food worker), but I can't understand why an American doctor makes so much more than a Rwandan doctor, or an American food worker makes so much more than a Nigerian one. 

So this very directly means something to me. It's completely takes the wind out of the first world socialist ""help the poor"" argument because it points out that most of them simply want to tax the rich and give to themselves, instead of taxing themselves and giving to the billions of humans who are exponentially worse off.

You have no money in your pocket, but you also have no debt. Your net worth is $0. Using Oxfam's methodology, you are $200,000 richer than me. 

There are many other problems with that statistic too. For example, it looks at raw numbers instead of weighting for cost of living. It only looks at the formal economy (money stored in banks, stocks, etc.) instead of the [informal economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_economy), etc. 

The biggest thing is that it says that a handful of billionaires have more money than the bottom 50%. That's true, but a big reason why is because the bottom 50% has almost nothing. Say there are 50 people with $0. Simply having $1 is enough to be richer than all 50 of those people. And in this way, the American lower middle class has exponentially more wealth than the bottom 50% of humanity too.

Consumption rates and standard of living matter most. Say Jeff Bezos owns 100 Ferraris. I have used Toyota. You have nothing. The difference between 0 car and 1 car is enormous. The practical difference between 1 used cars and 100 nice cars is tiny. Say Bezos has a mansion. I rent a small apartment. You are homeless. The jump is between homelessness and an apartment, not apartment and a big penthouse. Or say healthcare is too expensive and you die of diabetes at 70 years old. That's not very different from a rich person dying of a heart attack at 80. But it's very different from an impoverished person dying of an easily prevented infectious disease at 5.

My argument is similar to when people criticize alt-righters as /r/SelfAwarewolves. They are almost able to figure out the problem with their view, but stop just short of it. Most progressive Americans care about the poor. But their policies don't actually help poor people. They simply take from the rich and give to the slightly less rich (themselves). I could say this is based on selfishness, but more likely it's based on ignorance. Aside from watching a movie like Slumdog Millionaire once in a while, Americans don't see abject poverty. The homeless in the US are homeless because of mental illness, drug/alcohol use, and temporary changes in life circumstances (e.g., their parents kick them out of the house for being gay). Meanwhile, billions of humans are homeless not because there is something that went wrong. That's just how things are for them. They just lost the birth lottery and ended up completely screwed."

changemyview,fg343hx,t3_ewirrf,1580469434.0,"You can dislike both or say one is better than the other, but liberals and conservatives are very different in this respect, even if the deficit is exactly the same.

First we need to know how this process works and what these terms mean. I've simplified the terms and rounded the numbers:

1. Americans citizens do a bunch of work. The total amount of work American citizens do is called the gross domestic product or GDP. This is about $20 trillion a year right now.
2. The US government collects taxes on money. Right now it's about $3 trillion.
3. The US government spends money. Right now it's about $4 trillion.
4. The deficit when you take tax revenue ($3 trillion) minus spending ($4 trillion). This amounts to negative $1 trillion.
5. To cover this, the US issues government debt. You can go to treasurydirect.gov and loan the US money today. They'll pay you back with interest later.
6. The US is confident in its ability to pay back debt both because the US has a strong economy, but also because the US issues debt in dollars. And the magic thing about being the US government is that can make new dollars out of thin air. So if the US government wanted, it could just print a trillion dollars and pay off all debt. This would cause a major problem called hyperinflation and destroy the economy, but it's an option that's available to the government.

So what's the difference between liberals and conservatives?

* Liberals generally raise taxes and spend more. So hypothetically, there's $20 trillion in GDP. Liberals would hypothetically raise $4 trillion in taxes and spend $4.5 trillion. The deficit would be $0.5 trillion. But the catch is that American citizens would only get to keep $16 trillion.

* Conservatives like generally cut taxes and spend less on social programs. So say there's $20 trillion in GDP. They would raise $3 trillion and would spend $4 trillion. The deficit is $1 trillion. But the catch is that American citizens would get to keep $17 trillion. Even though the deficit is higher, the total spending is less.

So say you are in charge of buying food for your roommates. Do you want a roommate who eats 2000 calories and doesn't exercise. Or do you want a roommate who eats 2500 calories, but burns 500 calories a day exercising. Both of them have the same caloric deficit/surplus (0 calories in either direction). But the second roommate consumes more food.

There is more nuance to this idea because everything is interconnected:

1. It's better for all American citizens if there are less taxes.
2. It's better for all American citizens if there are more high quality social programs.
3. Governments are extremely inefficient with money. If there is food program in schools, half the money might be wasted to bureaucracy, government contracts to lobbyists, useless infrastructures projects that create jobs in the politician's home districts, etc. Only a small percentage of the money actually makes it to the kids.
4. Governments often invest in stupid ideas that lose money instead of make money. The Vietnam Wars was insanely expensive and the US left without much to show for it. 
5. The government sometimes invests in amazing ideas that make a ton of money. NASA, the National Institutes of Health, etc. all come to mind.
6. About half of American households pay taxes. The poorer half don't pay any taxes. So raising taxes hurts the rich more.
7. Some government programs benefit everyone, but many only benefit the poor (e.g., Medicaid). So more government spending is generally better for the poor.
8. More debt is better for Americans today, but is worse for future generations.
9. Lower taxes are better for Americans today, and if it results in greater economic growth, it's better for Americans in the future too.

The key thing to keep in mind is that over time, tax rates should always be falling unless new government programs are implemented. Say the US has a GDP of 20 trillion, and spends $5 trillion a year. For the deficit to be 0, there has to be a 25% tax rate. Now say that the US economy grows and the GDP doules to $40 trillion. If the cost of government is still only $5 trillion, that means there only has to be a 12.5% tax rate. This idea is called economy of scale. If the government keeps the tax rate at 25% and doesn't raise spending, that means there would be $15 trillion a year going to pay off the national debt.

As one more nuance, debt isn't necessarily good or bad. If you get a $200,000 loan to go to medical school, you almost certainly will come out ahead in the long term. If you get a $200,000 loan to buy a Ferrari, drive it around and sell it for $100,000, you lost $100,000 that you can't get back. In the same way, if the US government invests in something like education that leads to Americans being more productive in the future, it would make everyone better off in the long run. But if the US spends on healthcare for an elderly person, it helps that person in the short term. But it won't help society in the long term because there is no corresponding increase in productivity.

So to bring it back to your original point, I don't think Trump can be blamed for increasing the deficit because he did so by lowering tax revenue. On the other hand, Bush lowered taxes and spent a ton of money on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He very directly raised the deficit. On the other hand, Clinton and Obama actually decreased the deficit compared to their predecessors (though they still added to the overall national debt). But they did so by not lowering taxes as would be expected given the increased economy of scale.

Ultimately a budget is a budget. It's a reality for all politicians regardless of their political views. So there isn't that much room to deviate, which is the point of your view. But within the confines of the budget, there is a big difference in how both sides operate. Because of how long national debt lasts (the US government is still paying off debt from the American Civil War), and the long term nature of economic cycles and climate change, it's hard to tell what's good and bad unless you're an economic historian in the year 2200.

As a final point, there are distinctions between liberals and progressives (progressives are more willing to spend and take on debt), and fiscal conservatives and neocons (the neocons spent a ton of money on wars). But that's another story."

Well, yeah. That's the nature of being alive. Everyone dies eventually, and everyone risks death in the short term. We make these trade offs all the time. And we don't even maximize safety above all. Accidents are the third leading cause of death in the US. Road accidents alone are the 8th leading cause of death on Earth. If we banned cars, we'd completely eliminate this risk. But we'd lose all the benefits of cars. We've collectively done a cost benefit calculation and determined that cars are worth it, even if there is a solid chance that our families could be killed in one. We take reasonable steps to avoid risk, but there is a risk-benefit ratio that we are willing to live with.

There is something called the law of diminishing returns. Say it costs $100 for 2000 calories of food today. I'd spend the $100. But I wouldn't spend $1000 for 20,000 calories of food today. On the flipside, if I was starving, I'd spend $1000 for just 500 calories of food.

In this way, say I'd take a 0.1% chance of death tomorrow for $10,000 as you listed above. But the price for me to be willing to risk a 10% chance of death would be exponentially greater, not linearly as you described. So I'd want $100 billion in exchange for a 10% chance of death, not 10 million as you suggested. They key thing here is that people vote on the rates for a given level of risk. Also, even 0.1% is an insanely high risk. The real life figures for car crashes (or helicopter crashes for that matter) are far smaller.

When I get there, all the disabled spaces are taken and many of them by the people who are not disabled. How should this be compensated to me? Do I get a compensation from the company that runs the place? Do I get it only if I actually show up at that place, or do I get in mail a portion of the fees collected from non-disabled parkers in those spots? If the former, the result can be that I start farming the system, ie. I drive around the city finding disabled parking spots taken by non-disabled people and go to demand a compensation for the harm.

Any one of these payment options are fine. It can be a monthly check to all disabled people, or it can be a one off check for anyone who tries to get a spot. As for who pays, it would primarily be the person who choose to park in the spot. But it could also partially be the store owner for not having enough parking spots available. Next, if you can successfully farm the system, then good for you. It raises the cost of someone parking in a disabled spot and people will do it less often. This is similar to the idea of deterrence, but it's more directly set based on local circumstances (e.g., how busy the area is on a given day).

That's what happens when one well meaning government bureaucrat tries to set standardized rules for everyone instead of using a democratic crowdsourcing model of decision making.

If something is outright unacceptable (e.g., murder), then there shouldn't be fines at all. We use fines for low level ""crimes."" But I don't think most of these things should crimes at all. If I leave an empty bottle on a park bench, it's a crime (littering) that is punished with a fine. But if I leave an empty bottle in a table in a bar, it's not a crime. I just pay someone to clean it up for me.

We could do the same thing in parks. You can litter, but you have to pay for someone to clean your mess. And if there is only a 10% chance you get caught, then you have to pay for the cleaning fees for 10 separate littering instances.

This is better in a democracy because there are all sorts of people with different views. Right now there is a system where a majority group decide what is right and wrong, and a minority group that is forced to follow those rules. What I'm proposing involves the majority group setting a price where they would be ok with the minority group doing a given negative action. Then anyone who wants to do that negative action can simply pay the price to do it. There's no judgement on any given action, just a negotiated price to do it. That way, everyone is happier. Either no negative action happens, or you know you are getting paid if it does. And on the other side, you aren't demonized for doing something you want to do that others dislike. You simply pay for it.

To bring it back to the original point, I don't think that the majority cares about low level ""crimes"" that are punished via fines. There is a price at which everyone is happy with a given system and unhappy with a given system. For example, people don't like gambling. But they are ok with a lottery system as long as the state gets most of the money. People don't like marijuana use, but they are ok if the state gets a large chunk of tax revenue from it's sale. As long a person who does a perceived negative action pays to cover the overall cost of cleanup, inconvenience, etc. the majority is generally fine with it.

> That extra is to deter them from doing the math of how much does it cost to compensate the harm and instead avoid doing the harm in the first place.

Yes, that's the whole point of what I'm saying. If someone ""harms"" me, but then also compensates me to my satisfaction, I don't mind it at all. From my perspective it's the same. The only difference is that they get to be happy too.

> So, that's why the compensation model doesn't directly work with the fines where the money goes to everyone, not just the ones who are most affected. The deterrence model still works as it will deter people from doing the negative things and this benefits exactly to those would be negatively affected by the negative things.

Deterrence benefits everyone except the person who wants to do something considered a crime, but the fines are paid to the state. In the compensation model, the ""criminal"" pays the people who are affected, weighted by how much they are affected. That way everyone remains at their neutral standard position.

> There's no way to compensate the death caused by driving the same way as there is for 10 minute delay by letting the people who want to pay for empty road go first. 

Sure there is. This is the whole purpose of the insurance industry. You can [even get a PhD in it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science) The simplest thing to do is to charge people who take on greater risk extra, and give that money to people who take less risk. That way the total risk stays the same, it's just distributed less evenly.

As a final point, you are thinking about this in very old fashioned terms. Technology has made the process of tracking risk at an individual level much easier. Instead of generalizing that young men in red sports cars drive worse than others and deserve a higher insurance rate, you can directly track their driving habits with a GPS and accelerometer in their cars. Car insurance companies have been doing this for over a decade. You might say that no one wants to have big brother watching over their shoulder about how well they are driving, but it's a voluntary process. People put these trackers in their cars to prove they are low risk drivers and get lower car insurance rates.

Overall, there are times when people need to do things that other people don't like. Instead of outright criminalizing most things, it's better to set things up to be flexible. So instead of banning babies from airplanes because they cry, a parent can pass out earplugs to their nearby passengers and buy them each a drink. That kind of thing helps some people a great deal and compensates others for their losses."

There's no such thing as right or wrong in court. There isn't even a test to find if someone is innocent. There is only guilty or not guilty. You are innocent until proven guilty, and if you are found not guilty, you can't be retried for the same crime because it would be double jeopardy. Unless God tells you whether you were right or wrong, it's impossible to gauge whether something is actually right or not.

> It has occurred to me after seeing many court cases where prosecutors are more motivated just to get another notch on their belt (perhaps to show they are effective in their role) rather than whether or not the person they are trying is actually guilty or not.

That's not a bug, it's a feature. The US judicial system was designed from the start to be an adversarial system. The prosecutor's sole job is to convict you. Your defense attorney's sole job is to get you off. They don't decide whether you are guilty or not. They just present the most one-sided view of the facts they can to the jury. The jury's job is to weigh the two one-sided presentations and actually determine guilt. Furthermore, the jury is stacked in favor of finding people not guilty. So the prosecutor really can't pull punches. Their whole job is to be as harsh as possible. Their job is purposefully designed to be win-at-all costs.

> Another chief motivation for this win-at-all-costs pursuit, from what I've long observed, seem to be using their record as prosecutor to help them win higher political offices, typically using the common ""tough on crime"" angle. This is one of the biggest reasons there are sometimes false convictions.

You have this backwards. Prosecutors only move forward with a case if they think they have enough evidence to get a jury to convict someone. If they care about being elected, the incentive is to try fewer cases. That way the overall cost of the judicial system goes down which makes taxpayers happier. More importantly, it keeps their conviction rates higher (which is like a kill death ratio in a first person shooter). 

So say that there are three murder cases. In one case, there isn't enough evidence to convict. So the prosecutor has to assume they are innocent and let them go unless more evidence comes up. In the next case, there is a ton of evidence and it's an open and shut case. The prosecutor presents the case to the grand jury and they convict the killer. The last case is the interesting one. There is maybe enough evidence to convict, but it would be a tough case. If the prosecutor has political ambitions, the smart thing to do is not prosecute the case because if they lose they look bad, and if they win, they still risk looking bad. So politically motivated prosecutors have the incentive to let guilty people go, not falsely convict innocent people."

Compare this to home squeezed orange juice, or orange juice squeezed fresh at fancy grocery stores. The local non-factory machines can't strain out all the pulp. They can mostly just make normal pulp orange juice. But they can get the juice into your mouth within 24-48 hours as opposed to over 72 hours. And this makes all the difference because there is a turning point for orange juice where it goes from being absolutely sweet, tart, and delicious to tasting flat and sour. It happens around the three day mark.

So even if you dislike pulp, the ranking goes: 0-3 day old orange juice with no pulp, then 0-3 day old orange juice with pulp. Then there is a big drop in quality. Then it goes 3+ day old orange juice with no pulp, which tastes pretty much the same as 3+ day old orange juice with pulp. Unless you work at an orange juice factory that has the fancy machines, there is no way to get pulpless orange juice before it turns at the 3 day mark. The only way to get freshly squeezed orange juice before it loses its flavor is to get the kind with pulp in it and drink it quickly before it tastes the same as any other factory produced brand of orange juice. Again, there is nothing wrong with the factory juice, it's just that they can't put it in your hands quickly enough.

Edit: I really can't express how much better the 0-72 hour juice tastes than regular orange juice. I don't particularly like orange juice regularly (especially because it's just as bad for you as a soda), but the freshly squeezed stuff is amazing. I tried it at a grocery store that juices it on site, and it makes a huge difference. If you buy it and take it home, it's still good for day or so. But after 3 days, it starts to taste like any other mainstream brand of not from concentrate orange juice (e.g., Tropicana or Florida's Natural). Also, don't get me started on concentrated orange juice, which is even worse than 3+ day orange juice."

changemyview,fg0a00w,t1_fg00b0j,1580403401.0,"I understand the deterrence argument, but I think it's based on an outdated view of government from the days of monarchies. Say I'm Henry XIII of England. As king, I set the laws for everyone else in society. I control what is acceptable and what isn't, as well as how much I value a given law. As such, I can fine people as a deterrence against breaking one of my laws.

The issue is that now many societies have become democracies. There is no monarch that determines what is acceptable and what isn't. Democracies exist through the collective agreement of their citizens. So instead of a single entity making decisions for all, there are a bunch of citizens negotiating the positive and negative value of a given action. When the state gets revenue from fines, it's not to line the pockets of a single ruler. It's distributed to every other citizen, (if not directly or in the form of benefits, then in the form of slightly lower taxes than would otherwise be needed).

So let's just pick a type of fine and examine how this could work. Say there is a beautiful lake. On one side, there is a tourist town. On the other side there's a factory. Say the factory pollutes the lake, which ruins it for swimming, fishing, etc.. How much should the fine be? If we go with the old monarchy style view, the king could say that it's priceless and that the fine should be proportional to the person's ability to pay. But in the democracy style view, the society should determine a collective value for the lake and apply it in advance.

So say there is only one lake and it's the only food source on the planet. If it's polluted for fishing, then everyone starves. If that's the case, then the lake truly is priceless. But say there are thousands of lakes and plenty of other food sources. Then that particular lake might be worth billions of dollars, but it's not absolutely priceless. It has a set high end value that everyone can agree on (e.g., $100 billion).

At that point, the factory can make a choice. If they think that they can make $200 billion dollars of money from the lake, they should buy it from everyone else and pollute it. Everyone would be the same because they valued the lake at $100 billion and they got that much money. There wouldn't be a fine against an offense to the king, just a set price for the lake listed in advance. That way people would make choices in advance of their action. 

Note this hypothetical $100 billion includes all value to the townspeople, the environment, future generations, etc. I'd even include the cost of relocating/saving the animals in the lake. And the $200 billion value means it's only worth polluting the lake if it means developing the cure for cancer or something that exceeds the high value of the lake.

In this way, fines are no longer judgement calls based on someone's opinion. There are no more correct and incorrect actions. Just a democratically set price for a given action based on how much it helps or hurts others. So if speeding causes X amount of risk, you can choose to speed if it's worth it to you (e.g,. you are late for an important meeting). We can also pay drivers who choose to drive more slowly in the right lane.

You could say that this means rich people can just violate the rules whenever they want. But the price for this action would be democratically set high enough that everyone else would want them to ""break the rules."" In fact, it wouldn't even be characterized as breaking the rules, just a legal set price for a given action (e.g,. speeding, drug use, polluting, etc.) And these extra negative actions would be counteracted with positive ones from people who value the money that comes from counteracting the action (e.g,. driving slower, caring for drug users, picking up litter, etc.)

This is a behavioral psychology and behavioral economics inspired approach to governing, instead of the classic crime and punishment model. And it's already being implemented in small ways. For example, airlines used to just kick people off of overbooked flights. Now they pay people who volunteer to take the next flight. Overall, I think this is a much more fair way of pricing things for people than for an authority figure (the king or majority group in society) deciding certain actions are bad, and then charging fines as punishment or deterrence."
changemyview,fg01dxx,t3_ew6dt8,1580398051.0,"> My mother has a serious mental illness and is currently institutionalized. My father retired early but doesn’t have enough money to support himself. I’m not complaining about any of this, rather I just don’t see the privilege in it. 

Would you say that someone whose mother didn't have mental illness was privileged compared to you in that respect? Would you say that someone's whose parents were extremely wealthy is privileged compared to you?

There are many different kinds of societal privilege. For example, you can be privileged in a given society based on social class, age, education, religion, gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. You can be privileged in some ways, but worse off in others.

For example, take someone like Malia Obama. She is a black woman. She doesn't have white privilege or gender privilege. But she has privilege based on socioeconomic status, education, sexual orientation, etc. She is more privileged than you and almost every straight white man on this website. But if she was in the exact same situation, but was also a white man, she'd be slightly better off.

In your case, you have some kinds of privilege, but not others. But if your situation was exactly the same, but you were also not white, you'd be slightly worse off than now. Hence you have white privilege, but are missing out on other types of privilege.

The problem that people make is that they pick and choose which privileges they want to focus on, and it's usually the ones they don't have. So a rich white woman might focus on gender inequality, and a poor white man might focus on wealth inequality. The thing about privilege is that people who have it generally don't realize they benefit from it. It's like the episode of Friends where they fight about money. 

> Ross: Okay, well, I guess I just never think of money as an issue.

> Rachel: That's because you have it.

So at the end of the day, you do have white privilege. It's not obvious to you, but it's obvious to every non-white person in America. But you have certain disadvantages that aren't obvious to other people either. After weighting everything together, you might be better off or worse off than someone else. And the mistake people make is focusing on a single factor instead of the bigger picture. But that is a problem with the people making the claim, not a problem with the concept itself. So a presumptuous person can make a baseless generalization about you using white privilege as their justification. But that's their mistake, not a problem with the overall idea. 

Ultimately, if you can recognize certain kinds of privilege in others (e.g., Malia Obama), then you understand how other people can recognize certain types of privilege in you. It's not really about criticizing people based on it. It's just about being aware of people's varying circumstances."

The first one you like because it's a labor union and the second you dislike because it's an evil corporate monopoly. But they're fundamentally the same thing.

The difference between what I'm saying and what you're saying is that my positions come from behind a veil of ignorance. The veil is an idea by the philosopher John Rawls where you imagine where you a soul that is about to be born into society, but you don't know where. How would you set things up fairly? If you stack the deck in one group's favor, that's great if you are born into that group. But if you happen to be born in the other group, you'd be screwed. So the trick is to create a society that is fair to all. 

Your position on the other hand comes from a place where you already know your socioeconomic status. You are now trying to change the rules so that they benefit your group in particular. Billionaires are evil and you'll never become one. First world warehouse workers are good because you are in that class already. You're now trying to stack the deck in favor of your already determined side, not set things up in a neutral manner.

In the pharma example, you are alive today so you want cheaper drug prices today, even if it means there are fewer drugs discovered for humans in future generations. In the first world worker example, you want American workers to be able to negotiate a living wage. Yet if you are a high school dropout turned single parent of 3 who works 40 hours a week at minimum wage, you are in the top 16% of humanity. If you earned what you have termed a ""living wage"" ($15/hour), you'd be in the top 1% of humanity. Even if you're homeless in America, you have twice the carbon footprint of an average human being. 

Without resorting to arguments based on race, religion, nationality, etc. I can't understand why an American deserves so much more than anyone born in Asia, South America, or Africa. If you actually cared about the poor instead of just yourself, you'd tax billionaires and yourself and give it to the hundreds of millions of people who can't even afford toilets and who live on less than $2 a day. You might say that the cost of living is lower in poorer countries, but all the figures I listed are already adjusted for purchasing power parity (i.e., cost of living)."

Beyond that, if there is a monopsony in your field, it makes sense to leave that field. Say you're a pharmaceutical company that cures diabetes. It cures 30 million Americans and saves the US hundreds of billions of dollars. But because it's such an important cure, you can't charge much for it without everyone hating you. On the other hand, say you invent the cure for male pattern baldness. You can charge whatever you want because people think of it as an unimportant cosmetic procedure for vain old men. Because of this, more companies focus on curing baldness than diabetes.

Maybe some people are noble and care about diabetes. But most people don't care about diabetes in particular. They'd rather invest their career in something that is good for humanity, but that is also profitable. For example, if you go into tech, you can do good things, but also make a ton of money. The long term result is that the price of existing drugs will be capped, but fewer people will want to make new drugs in the future. This dynamic is why there haven't been any new insulins or antibiotics discovered in many years. It's just far more profitable to try to cure less important diseases."

changemyview,ffzeo2a,t3_evvp4p,1580375241.0,"> Growing the crops for plant-based food results in the deaths of many other animals to protect the crops from being eaten by wildlife. So are we really changing/achieving anything at all if we have to kill other animals to grow that crop?

According to the [ecological pyramid,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_pyramid#/media/File:Ecological_Pyramid.svg
) only 10% of the calories an animal eats is available to the carnivore who eats that animal. So say you grow 100 plants. If you feed 100 plants to 100 people, you kill 100 plants and the animals who would try to eat 100 plants. Now say you grow 1000 plants. You feed 100 animals. Then 100 humans eat 100 animals. The second situation requires killing 10 times as many plants as before. It requires killing 10 times as many wild animals who would eat that crop. 

> Animals killing other animals for food is unfortunately embedded in the world's nature. Some vegans absolutely shame you into thinking you're an awful person for eating meat, whilst caressing a cat/dog who are carnivorous and only eat meat, and would gladly rip up and torture an animal if it meant them getting their meal. Look at nature, look at wildlife. Why one thing for humans and another for animals?

The ethical principle is to cause as little harm as you can. A lion has to eat meat to live. So the least harm they can do is to kill prey. Humans have a choice to eat plants directly, or grow 10 times as many plants, feed them to animals, and then then kill the animal. In doing so, humans make the most harmful choice.

Predators frequently engage in surplus killing. They kill more than they can immediately eat. But this isn't killing just for fun (although I'm sure they enjoy it.) The idea is to either leave a carcass they can return to eat later, or to eat the healthiest parts of the prey. They want quantity and quality of food. 

This doesn't apply to humans. On the cache side, we get far more quantity of food if we eat plants directly. On the quality side, plant based foods are far healthier than meat. Whether it's most of South Asia or Loma Linda, CA, vegetarians live far longer than people who eat meat. The only other diet that has similar longevity is the Mediterranean diet where people also add a tiny amount of fish, chicken, and eggs. Around the world, consumption of red meat is associated with a  much earlier death. In this way, the principal benefit of eating meat isn't to get higher quality food, but simply because people like the taste. Mouth pleasure is hard to justify given the ethical, environmental, and health consequences of eating meat.

> If we didn't breed animals for food, they wouldn't have had any life at all. The sole reason that they exist is because a human has bred them for food. So maybe it's a good thing that they exist in the first place to then enjoy life?

I'm not having sex right now. I'm not procreating. So a potential child is not coming into the world. The net effect is that the human population remains the same. Do you think choosing not to have a child is the same as if I had a child and then murdered it? In the grand scheme of things the net effect on the population is the same. And you could argue that a few years of life beats no life at all. But we tend to make a big ethical distinction between murder and not breeding in the first place."

It makes sense that I should pay you $1000 to replace your TV. Now say Bill Gates comes over to your house and breaks your TV. Should he have to pay $10,000 because his income is so much greater than ours? Or should he just pay the $1000 to replace the TV? 

Fines and damages should be based on the actual value of the harm being perpetrated. They shouldn't be used just to control people's behavior. If someone litters on the ground, it causes the same amount of harm to society regardless of whether they person who litters is rich or poor. The purpose of fining people for littering isn't to force them to behave according to our wishes. It's to make them pay for the full cost of their action. The fine should be enough to cover the cost of the cleanup, weighted by the likelihood of being caught. 

So say I cause $10 of reversible damage to the environment, and I have a 10% chance of getting caught. Then my fine should be $100 because that's the amount of money that I have to pay to cover the negative consequences of my actions. That's the amount of money that brings my impact back to neutral. We can even add in a fee to account for the amount of time it actually takes to find and clean the litter too. And as for you armed robbery example, the punishment should be prison, not a fine. It should be the same regardless of the socioeconomic status of the perpetrator. Poor people shouldn't be disproportionately punished relative to rich people and vice versa.

All the problems you talk about make perfect sense. But the solution you propose has some twisted side effects. For example, consider the idea of forced labor in prisons. During the Jim Crow era, white Americans used to arrest black Americans, put them in prison, and make them work on farms and other places as forced labor. The idea was to make criminals do something productive, but it devolved into slavery 2.0. In the same way, if you fine wealthy people more money to defray the cost of public defenders for the poor, the incentive is to arrest wealthy people more often to reduce taxes for everyone else. We already see excessive ticketing in cities with speed traps. I think it the goal is to build a better criminal justice system, the goal should be to cut costs across the board and stop using fines for superfluous non-violent ""crimes"" such as ""loitering"" as a means of raising revenue. Or if we believe in all the laws currently on the books, then it's much more fair to simply tax everyone upfront and honestly. A well functioning legal system is as much a public good as a fire department or military."

It's just a matter of how you spin it.

changemyview,ffvrw19,t3_evcqvb,1580271507.0,"There are a few ways to govern choice: 

1. You want your kid to eat something healthy for dinner. If you say ""Eat your vegetables!"" they don't want to do it. But if you ask them ""Do you want to eat your carrots first, or your broccoli first?"" then they think they have a choice and make a good one. 
2. Or instead of asking them what toy they want, you ask them if they want a book or a puzzle. They think they are getting to pick, even though you've narrowed down their options to two acceptable outcomes.
3. Or you can offer seemingly unlimited choices, but in reality, there is only one option. You can offer one good choice and a bunch of terrible ones. This is similar to how magicians force a card, where they say ""Pick a card, any card."" but get you to choose something that is acceptable to them.
3. Or you can offer Hobson's choice which is a free choice where only one thing is offered. ""Take it, or leave it.""

In all of these situations, the chooser technically made the choice. But their options were limited by someone else. The same thing happens with food choice in the US, and this happens to be the perfect time to remind ourselves of why.

1. Unhealthy food is dirt cheap and convenient in the US, and healthy food is extremely expensive and inconvenient. Why buy fresh veggies and cook dinner when you can just go to McDonald's and buy a burger? Why buy fresh fruit that spoils quickly, when you can store a bunch of high fructose syrup laden snack bars in your house? Fresh veggies cost a ton of money at places like farmer's markets and Whole Foods. Meanwhile, many poor Americans don't have a grocery store within an hour or two of their house. These areas are called food deserts.

2. This doesn't make sense. Based on the basic laws of ecology, veggies are always 10 times cheaper than meat. This is because only 1% of the energy from the sun that hits a leaf is absorbed by plants. Then only 10% of the energy in a plant is eaten by the animal that eats the planet. Then only 10% of that energy is eaten by the animal that eats that animal, and so on. This is called the [ecological pyramid.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_pyramid#/media/File:Ecological_Pyramid.svg)

3. There is another explanation. Storing and transporting food is expensive. It's easier to freeze or refrigerate a bunch of burgers and transport them than to move fresh fruits and vegetables. But this doesn't explain everything for two reasons. The first is that it's easy to freeze, can, refrigerate, or otherwise store fruits and veggies. The second is that Amazon and Walmart became successful companies by making supply chains more efficient. If they can transport meat without it rotting, they can also transport veggies.

4. The big difference is price. When cigarettes are cheap, people smoke more. But when governments added a bunch of taxes to them, people choose to smoke less. Meanwhile, meat, booze, and high fructose laden junk food continue to be dirt cheap.

5. You might think that I'm going to say we should add sin taxes to junk food, which isn't a very libertarian friendly idea. It doesn't really address your question either. That implies that people prefer unhealthy choices unless the government forces them to not make that choice. But that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that instead of taxing unhealthy food, the US simply needs to stop subsidizing junk food.

6. The US offers a guaranteed price minimum for corn. So say consumers are sick of corn and want to buy spinach. In a free market, some farmers would switch to spinach because they'll make greater profit off of it. But because of the subsidies, the risk adjusted returns aren't worth it. Best case, you make a little bit more with spinach. Worst case, you lose a ton of money. So why grow spinach? It makes sense to stick with corn.

7. This excess corn supply means that animal feed, ethanol, and high fructose corn syrup are dirt cheap. So the things that are made with corn are expensive including meat, booze, and sweetened junk food. The low spinach supply means that spinach is relatively expensive. As a result, any individual American now has to choose between something cheap, convenient, and tasty and something expensive, inconvenient, and bland. We think we have the choice, but it's been made for us.

8. So why does this happen? The answer is because of this coming Monday. The first state that votes in any presidential primary is Iowa. Iowa grows a ton of corn. So politicians who want to be president gave Iowa corn farmers subsidies to ensure their votes. Even the ones that want to get rid of the subsidies can't because it means taking away something corn farmers expect.

9. But beyond the corn farmers themselves, the real lobbying force is the companies that buy corn. Pepsi, McDonald's, Tyson Foods, and the entire liquor industry all depend on dirt cheap corn to make their products cost effective. They lobby the government to give special subsidies to their businesses.

10. I'll take it one step further and point out that Illinois just passed a bill capping the price of insulin at $100. It was on /r/UpliftingNews. But this isn't uplifting at all. Capping the price of insulin screws over pharmaceutical companies and helps people with diabetes. But people only have diabetes because government the government regularly gives money to farmers and companies that make junk food in the first place. So indirectly, this means taking money from pharmaceutical companies and handing it to junk food companies. But in the meantime, 10% of Americans have diabetes, which is a highly preventable illness.

There was a study about rats and drugs. They were trapped in a small cage with a button. If they pushed the button, a little bit of cocaine came out. As you can imagine, they smashed that button liked crazy until they died. But the follow up study put the rats in in a big fun open area where they had many different things to do. The rats stopped using the cocaine as much. Americans are like that when it comes to food. Because of the American government's agricultural policy, junk food is cheaper, easier, and tastier than healthy food. It makes perfect sense for people to ""choose"" to be fat. But if we switched back to a free market where people paid the actual price for junk and healthy food, people would make far better choices. 

I'll close by saying that if 99 people make a good decision and 1 person makes a stupid one, it's probably that individual's fault. But if 70 people make bad decisions, and only 30 make good ones, that's a systemic problem. In the US, 70% of Americans are overweight or obese. Our ancestors weren't obese. Other countries aren't obese. But there is something about living in the US over the past 70 or so years that has resulted in Americans becoming fat. It doesn't matter if your parents came from England, Germany, Italy, Japan, India, Mexico, etc. As soon as you move to the US, you get fat. And there is a demonstrated trend that the more foreign countries import food from the US, the fatter they get. To me, this suggests a systemic problem, not a matter of individuals making bad choices."

What makes American workers special? 

* If you are a high school dropout in the US who works 40 hours a week at minimum wage while supporting 3 kids, you are in the top 16% of humanity. 
* If you are a single person who just graduated from college and make about $34,000 a year, you are in the global 1%. 
* If you are a homeless person in the US, you have twice the carbon footprint of the average human being.

You could say that the cost of living is lower in places like China or India. That's true, but all the figures I listed already adjust for cost of living.

Every person on Earth should be paid as little as possible. If you have some unique skill that very few other people develop, I can understand paying you more. It makes sense that a doctor makes more than a plumber. Not from a moral stance, but because of basic supply and demand. But if two humans are equally skilled, they should be paid the same.

Right now, there are billions of humans who have a high school level education. If they happened to be born in the US, they can get a minimum wage job that pays extremely well by international standards. If they are born in most of Asia, Africa, or South America, they have to make due with far less. Without resorting to arguments based on race, religion, or nationality, I don't see why a high school dropout in the US deserves a higher salary than a doctor in a poor country. 

So I can buy one of two arguments:

1. Capitalism: There should be no wealth distribution at all. Everyone is in it for themselves.
2. Communism: Everyone should pay all their money into a common pool, and all money should be redistributed evenly.

Both of these views are morally consistent with their ideologies. But what I can't stand is capitalism for me, and communism for thee arguments. And ""first world socialists"" are the undisputed kings of this argument (they edge out people who took government bailouts during the financial crisis) People are happy to tax the rich, but don't like to acknowledge that they are part of the rich. They want to tax the American 1%, but not the global 1% because many of them are part of the global 1%. Furthermore, when people think of taxing global corporations based in the US, they imagine giving all the money to Americans only. They want to tax people slightly richer than themselves, and give to themselves. They don't want to tax themselves and give to the hundreds of millions of people living in abject poverty. 

Minimum wage, tariffs, protectionism, tax cuts, government subsidies, blocking outsourcing, etc. are all part of this take from one person and give to another mechanism. If you are Donald Trump, you want to take from evil liberals and foreigners and give money to your base (factory workers, coal miners, lower middle class white men, etc.) If you are Bernie Sanders, you want to do the exact same thing except your base is mostly white liberals, college graduates, millennials, etc. Sanders in particular wants to raise the minimum wage for American workers, but also wants strict borders so that poor people from other countries can't get access to those high wages. That artificially raises American wages, and suppresses foreign ones.

Ultimately, a 15 dollar an hour ""living wage"" is enough money to be in the top 1% of humanity. I can't remotely understand why someone would consider that to be a living wage, when 10% of humanity lives on $2 a day. If you care about redistributing wealth instead of just raising your own standard of living, then every American should be taxed and their money should be distributed to them.

How are these things hedonism? Hedonism means ""the pursuit of pleasure; sensual self-indulgence."" That's not the same as the issues you listed. For example, take gay men. The conservative stereotype is a bunch of men on drugs having unprotected sex with strangers in a club. But the real life version of this is someone like Pete Buttiegeg or Neil Patrick Harris getting married, working regular jobs, adopting kids, and living their lives just like any other family. Being gay can mean hedonism, but it can mean no hedonism either. The same goes for the other ideas you mentioned.

If you are a ""culturally Christian"" person, it makes sense to feel like you are losing the culture wars to minorities, feminists, atheists, homosexuals, and all the other non-Christian people of the world. That's something we can observe across American society and the world. But saying those other worldviews are hedonistic in general is an extremely misleading statement. Just as many non-Christians aren't hedonists, many culturally Christian heroes are extremely hedonistic people. For every Pope Francis, there's a Joel Osteen. For every Martin Luther King, there's a Donald Trump.

Together, these ideas form a 4 box square. There's Christian hedonists and Christian non-hedonists. There's non-Christian hedonists and non-Christian non-hedonists. Hedonism gets a bad rap, so it makes sense to try to say your enemy are hedonists, but it's observably not true.

There's other arguments here. We could say that hedonoism isn't a bad thing. It's a focus on pleasure, which is inherently a good thing. It's only bad when it causes other problems. Plus, it's far better than the traditional American approach of harming perceived enemies. We could also say that there are other much bigger problems in the US (e.g., bigotry and intolerance). But the biggest thing that stuck out to me about your argument is that it associates perceived negative idea (hedonism) with a group that isn't uniquely or particularly associated with it. This is a classic propaganda strategy that has been used for thousands of years. We have to use critical thinking when we see it."

Fring lived quietly. He went to work everyday to be the owner/manager of a chicken restaurant. He was a major supporter of the DEA and law enforcement to the point where they never suspected him. He was screwed over by a Mexican cartel, but remained outwardly loyal before he quietly murdered all of them. He ran a highly efficient, well controlled meth operation and set Walter up for success. He was kind to his employees (as kind as a drug kingpin could be) and earned loyalty. It was Walter and Jessie who screwed the whole thing up (from their own perspective.) But in any case, Fring maintained power and authority for decades and every day he was in control, the trains ran perfectly.

White, on the other hand, created a spectacular meth empire built not on efficiency, but on the sheer quality of his product. He killed many potential supporters in a cruel and cutthroat manner. As a result, he was only able to maintain his empire for a few months/years before he lost his empire and died. His closest friends/family (his brother-in-law, his partner/assistant, his own son) turned on him. Federal agents knew exactly who he was and were constantly on the lookout for him. A band of incompetent idiots took over his business. He had to spend his final months in isolation before he went out in a blaze of glory.

In my opinion, Fring was the better drug kingpin. He took control, ran things efficiently, built loyalty, killed his enemies, amassed wealth, lived simply, and retained power for decades. White took control, pissed everyone off, and lost power within a few years. Then the entire thing collapsed after him. White didn't just destroy his own meth empire. He ruined the meth market for years to come.

Julius Caesar is more like White than Fring. He took power, irritated everyone else, and was killed about 5 years after he took over. He was only 55 when he died. And afterwards, Rome fell into a series of civil wars. Any idiot can get on a bull. Only a great bull rider can stay on as the animal tries to kick him off.

But the majority aren't willing to move/change/adapt and they continue to make the same amount of money as they did the previous year. But because everyone else is better off, they are relatively poor compared to before.

So why should the people who are willing to change be forced to give money to the people who don't change? The growth rate in India and China are around 7%. Some Americans go out of their way to do business in those places, despite the inconvenience. They don't even have to permanently move. They just go online and make business contacts with people in other countries. As a result, a large part of their revenue comes from a country growing at 6-7% instead of 1-2%. They then bring that money back to the US, which averages out the US growth rate to 2-3%.

It's not particularly hard. It just requires going out of your comfort zone. But instead of making even small adjustments, people prefer to stay put and then whine when they aren't making as much money others who did adapt. It's common with both the political right and political left in the US. For example, conservatives put a ton of effort into saving fossil fuel jobs. Meanwhile, clean tech workers are making a ton of money. Or instead of moving away from luxury places like New York City to cheaper up and coming cities, progressives prefer to stay in place and complain about gentrification. Instead of taking advantage of global growth, conservatives prefer to put in ""America First"" policies. Instead of seeing that corporations are way more efficient than small businesses and simply buying stocks (a $1 investment last year in the S&P 500 would be worth about $1.30 cents today), progressives complain that corporations are taking their jobs.

The world is changing. Some people see the blatantly obvious signs and adapt. Others keep doing the same thing their parents and grandparents did 50 years ago, and get frustrated when they don't get the same results. Annual ""cost of living"" wage increases are a way for the people who aren't adapting to siphon off money from the people who are stepping out of their comfort zones and changing the way they think and act. Maybe it's worth it in order to help people transition to the new global economy. But it definitely shouldn't be mandatory or expected.

But recently, researchers have done research about the idea of ""good"" bacteria. There are bacteria that live in our gut that don't hurt us. They just eat a little bit of the food we eat, make vitamin K for us, and just hang out in our gut. Other bacteria live in our mouth, on our skin, on/in our genitals, etc. This idea is broadly called the [human microbiome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_microbiome) Here's a [South Park clip about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfNPYolYC50)


Researchers have also started doing research about the [human virome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_virome) It's the same idea except for viruses instead of bacteria. The various human herpesviruses are part of this virome. We are talking about human herpesvirus 1 here, but human herpesvirus 6 and 7 were found in 98% of humans in one of the studies described in that Wikipedia article.

Now scientists and regular people are excited about the prospect of treating diabetes and cancer with poop transplants. The idea is that ""good bacteria"" can help us or at least be neutral. If a neutral bacteria doesn't help us, at least it can take up space so bad bacteria can't move in. For example, many people go to the hospital when they are sick. They take antibiotics, which kills the bad bacteria, but it kills all the good bacteria too, which allows bad bacteria (e.g., Clostridium difficile) to move in. There's a chance that viruses work the same way.

But even if all viruses are bad, we have to distinguish between viruses that cause horrible diseases and ones that don't really do anything. HHV-1 doesn't cause that many problems. It can be deadly for newborns, but it doesn't do anything in most people. Worst case scenario it just gives you a cold sore for a few days every few months. Considering that many other viruses cause death, a minor cosmetic issue in a minority of the population isn't a big deal.

As a broader point, it doesn't really matter what we humans think. The human microbiome and human virome are just part of life.

You are afraid of ""biological assault"" during sex, but it's entirely possible you got it when you drank from someone else's water bottle in a basketball game, or had a sip of Communion wine at church. Again, there's a 27% chance you got HSV-1 before you turned 14 and have been spreading to other people since. Unless you get tested (which doctors generally refuse to do because it's considered a waste of money), you'll never know your status for sure.

The exact same thing applies to HSV-1. Two-thirds of humans under the age of 50 have it. It's estimated that just under 100% of elderly humans have it. The only way you don't get it is if you die young before you have a chance to get it. In this way, it's not a deal breaker for most humans. We accept HSV-1 in the same way we accept the fact that there are more bacteria in our bodies than human cells. You're the one doing something weird here by not being ok with it.

Most people dislike HSV-1 because they think of herpes as a sexually transmitted disease. But it's transferred by saliva. You can get it from kissing, but more likely you get it from sipping other people's drinks, sharing spoons, etc. For this reason lots of little kids have it. Plus, no one knows they have it because it doesn't cause any symptoms in most people.

The irony of your post is that more likely than not, you already have HSV-1. You probably got it when you were a little kid because you tasted another kid's juice box. Maybe you watched the Seinfeld episode about double dipping and stopped afterwards, but most humans are first exposed between the ages of 1 and 5 when they stick everything they find in their mouth.

As a final point, there are 8 different herpes viruses. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is also called human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1). Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is also called human herpesvirus 2 (HHV-2). But then the other herpes viruses get better names. For example, varicella zoster virus is human herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3), and causes the chickenpox. Epstein-Barr virus is human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), and cause mono. Somehow people don't think it's disgusting to get chickenpox, but they think it's weird to get HSV-1, even though both of them are a type of herpes. Or mono is the ""kissing disease"" and is a common plot point on wholesome American sitcoms. Meanwhile, HSV-1, is a disgusting disease you're warned about in health class even though it's spread the same way (saliva). You might think that HSV-1 is different because it lasts your whole life, but so do the others. That's why people who have gotten the chickenpox can get shingles when they are older. HHV-3 lives in their body their whole life, just like HHV-1.

Ultimately, I think you have learned just enough about this disease to be grossed out by it, but not enough where you don't think it's a big deal.

Heroin involves injecting, snorting, or smoking a drug. It immediately gets into your bloodstream and you feel the effects all at once. Then it quickly fades away and you crash.

Meanwhile, if you take methadone (either by swallowing it or putting it under your tongue), it takes a while to start working and slowly maintains a minimal level in your body all day. You never feel high, but you never feel a crash either. You get the minimum amount of drug to avoid withdrawal symptoms, but not enough to feel a rush.

More importantly, people get heroin off the street and take as much as they want/can access/can afford. Over time, people want more and more. Meanwhile with methadone, a doctor is giving it to you. They carefully control your dose so you never get too much, too fast. They work with you to slowly taper you off.

If you can quit and can control your cravings, that's the best case scenario. But if you slip up and go back to heroin, that's terrible. Methadone is a little bit worse than not needing any opioids at all, but far better than slipping back into heroin or another drug. If your life on methadone means spending time with your family, working a job, and doing all the positive things then everyone else does, then the biggest difference is the inconvenience of having to go to a methadone clinic everyday.

As a final point, some people become ""more addicted"" than others. For one person their best case scenario is being on methadone forever because their only other choice is to be constantly addicted to heroin. For another person, they can start using heroin, switch to methadone, taper off, and then quit completely. Some people can just detox completely and go straight from heroin to nothing.

Now farmers who use all these tools can grow 100 units of food on an acre of land. The only issue is that while some farmers have adopted all the tools, most people aren't using them yet. Globalization has put tractors in farmers hands so their productivity has doubled from 1 unit to 2. But there is still significant room for growth. Billions of farmers can still go from 2 to 100.

You might say that she didn't do anything to build Amazon. But neither does anyone else who buys stock in Amazon. If you bought $500 of Amazon shares when it went public, you'd have over $600,000 today without doing anything (assuming you didn't sell it). If you didn't buy Amazon shares and put the money under your mattress, you'd have $500 cash today (which would be worth far less due to inflation).

The point I'm making is that MacKenzie Bezos was the very first investor in Amazon. She bought and held stock when it was absolutely worthless. If she had put the money under her mattress, she'd have nothing. But she invested in something that appreciated in value, and still owns that thing. So this has nothing to do with ""deserve."" She has a contract that says she owns something (shares of Amazon) that other people value at billions of dollars. Just because she gets a divorce doesn't mean she still doesn't own her own property."
PoliticalDiscussion,ffggp39,t3_etbq3p,1579905833.0,"Instead of implementing a new tax on unhealthy foods, why not simply stop subsidizing it in the first place? The US government ensures a guaranteed minimum price for corn. As a result of these farm subsidies, farmers choose to produce corn instead of spinach, even if consumers prefer spinach. Why take the risk? This massive supply of corn drives down prices for high fructose corn syrup, animal feed, and ethanol. As a result, soda, meat, and booze is dirt cheap in the US. Meanwhile, fruit, vegetables, and nuts are extra expensive.

One of the fundamental problems with tariffs, subsidies, regulation, protectionism, etc. is that politicians selectively control who and what gets taxed. So the trick is to tax everyone, but then selectively give your base or your buddy an exception to the tariff (especially in exchange for votes or donations). It's not just Trump. Pretty much every politician from every state and from every party does this. It happens even more often outside the US.

It's not all evil. When people were starving to death, it made sense to subsidize food that makes people fat. But not food production is far higher than before. No on starves to death anymore, even in the poorest places of Africa (or whatever place you imagine). There is plenty of growth stunting and malnutrition, but it's based on quality, not quantity of food."
changemyview,ffg6uzc,t3_etfmvs,1579899725.0,"There are two big problems with your argument.

1. 50 years ago, the US used to be outrageously rich and China was dirt poor. So it was way cheaper to make things in China. Now the average wage in China has gone way up so it's not as cost-effective to manufacture goods there. As a result, manufacturing is leaving China for places like India, Vietnam, etc. If it's 60 degrees in one room and 80 degrees in another, the equilibrium is that both room reach 70 degrees. The 80 degree room will never drop down to 69 degrees. In the same way, if there is ever a point where labor costs are the same around the world, manufacturing will be distributed around the world because it cuts down on shipping costs. So the US will never fall below a given floor. Otherwise, China will outsource to the US.

2. Do you want Pepsi to win or Coke to win? If you buy stock in both, you don't want either to kill the other. You want them to make money by cutting supply costs, shipping costs, increasing sales, etc. Do you want British doctors to win the Nobel Prize in Medicine or American doctors? Since you get a cure for a disease either way, you don't care who discovered it. You win no matter what. In the same way, Americans own stock in Chinese companies and vice versa. For $1 you can invest in thousands of companies spread out around the world including the US and China. At that point, you are rooting for both countries because you make money either way. Even if you don't buy stock, the better the other country does, the most suppliers, customers, investors, etc. you have. In this way, you are looking at the world like a NFL player who is trying to win the Superbowl instead of like an NFL owner who wants to make as much money as possible. The owner wants to win games, but more importantly, they want the value of the league to increase because that will result in more money. Humans often focus on relative wealth instead of absolute wealth. But if you think about it logically instead of emotionally, it's far better to have 10% of $100 than to have 50% of $2."

Then once the country did finally expel the colonial empire, many people realized that the quickest way to money, power, and prestige was to simply take over the existing structure. Instead of money and resources being extracted for some autocrat in Europe, why not take over as a local autocrat? All the infrastructure was already in place. The only difference was that the new throne/office was closer to home. And even if the old European ruler couldn't have full control, they were happy to support the new local ruler in exchange for a percentage of the resources they used to control. 

This happened to varying degrees in many countries around the world including India, South Africa, Iran, most of South America, most of Africa, etc. It's one of the ideas behind the [resource curse.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse) A big advantage of extracting resources is that you can invest it in better schools and making smarter people. As such, most of Western Europe educated people to become smarter leaders compared to places like Venezuela. 

The upside for those countries is that ideas travel free. So even though a bunch of Enlightenment-era philosophers in Europe invented ideas like democracy, everyone else in the world was able to learn from them and start to apply them locally. Nowadays, many former third world countries are leading the world in growth rates and economic development. China used to be the place you went to in order to get dirt cheap workers for your factory. Now Shenzhen is the only place on Earth where 1000 advanced electronics factories are next door to each other, and you can build a prototype device in two days. Places like India, Brazil, South Africa, etc. are similarly growing. 

Colonialism was horrible, and you're absolutely right that it's replacement with completely incompetent (or outright genocidal) local leaders was nearly as bad. But many of these countries seem to have cleared the hump and are starting to see rapid economic growth. China, India, and even Rwanda have 6-7% growth rates. Meanwhile, the US has a 2.3% growth rate. Europe is happy to get over a 1% growth rate. Part of this is that you can't improve much when things are already good, but part of it is being able to build the latest and greatest stuff from scratch."
changemyview,ffb9reh,t1_ffb44x8,1579756495.0,"You're asking me about a hypothetical alternative reality, so there's no way to know for sure. But the simplest answer is that globalization has always been inevitable for humanity. I am a person. I can interact with my mother, father, sister, brother, wife, husband, daughter, son, etc. The next level out is if I interact with my neighbor. The next level out is if me and my neighbors interact with the neighborhood next to ours. Then our community can interact with the next one over. Then our region can interact with the next one over. This grows until every human interacts with every other human. 

The limit before was how far I can walk and how loud I can yell. In a globalized world where I can talk to someone on the other side of the planet in real time, or fly to the other side of the planet in a day, everyone is my neighbor. The limitations now aren't travel times, but language and cultural differences.

Colonialism is like stealing your neighbor's food. Globalization is like making friends with them and starting a business together. So to really get at your question, the question is whether humans usually choose to make friends with their neighbors first, or if our first instinct is to kill and rob them. 

Most people have some cynical or idealistic answer, but I think it depends on the economy. If you feel like there's plenty of resources and opportunity, you make friends. If you feel like there isn't enough to go around, then it makes sense to kill and take. 

The problem is that humans (and all living things) are very short term focused on what's immediately in front of them. The twist with humanity is that we have the capacity to innovate. We can create value out of nothing. There wasn't much food on Earth, but we learned how to farm. Then farms didn't produce that much food, but we learned how to create fire, the wheel, tractors, fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation systems, GMOs, crop rotations, sustainability systems, etc. As a result, we can now produce 100 times as much food on a given amount of land as we could a few centuries ago. As a result, Earth can now support billions of humans instead of just a few million in centuries past. Innovation and efficiency have improved the standard of living for everyone on the planet.

So to get back to your question, it's possible that globalization could have happened first. But it's also possible that colonialism would happen first (especially because that's what actually happened). It depended on the economic circumstances of the time, and the short or long termism of the people who happened to happened to expand their global reach first. 

As a final point, I think that the people who decided to pursue colonialism were violent stupid idiots. But we are talking about humans centuries or millennia ago. War and violence was what they knew. Ideas like democracy, capitalism, communism, globalization, civil rights, human rights, etc. weren't invented until relatively recently. So in the hypothetical question you posed, humans had to discover/invent the idea of equal rights for other humans before they discovered/invented the ability to build a better ship or weapon. In this reality, the weapons were discovered first, but not by much."

But the government can't police people's thoughts. Many Americans discriminated against black people in areas like housing and hiring for decades after Martin Luther King was killed.

So to make an evenish comparison, we'd have to compare American black people to broke immigrants coming to the US today and in the recent past.

Furthermore, any tax revenue that was collected was spent on building infrastructure for free (white) citizens, not black slaves. Even if you think a bunch of corrupt politicians stole the tax money instead of spending it on citizens, that still represents money that was produced by black slaves and used by white politicians. Black slaves did work. All of their money was taken by white slave owners. Part of their money was taxed by the government. Part of that money went to white citizens, and part of that money went to corrupt white politicians. 

In this way, all three of those groups of white people benefitted off the work of slaves, and were able to invest that money over centuries. None of the profit or value that black slaves produced actually went to black slaves. So by the time black people were able to take advantage of their own labor and ingenuity, they were centuries of compounding interest behind white people."

In the end, even though I just stole a dollar, and eventually returned it to you, I end with $35,740.76. You end with $2.59. The moral of the story is that a dollar stolen a long time ago is worth way more than the same amount stolen today.

This is the reason why slavery has caused black Americans to continue to be in poverty 150 years after slavery ended. Slave owners took a dollar of their slave's labor and invested it for about 2 to 400ish years years. That dollar compounded over many years and become worth an insane amount of money. They then gave that money to their descendants. Meanwhile, slaves didn't have that money. They couldn't invest it for many years. Even today if black people got some huge reparations payout, it wouldn't be worth a fraction of what they would have had if they had that dollar (the product of their labor) several hundreds years ago.

This explains why most developing countries in Asia, Africa, and South America are still dirt poor even though colonialism ended many decades ago. They are improving rapidly, but it's not enough to make up for the centuries of lost investment returns on their stolen labor and resources."
PoliticalDiscussion,ffaizdu,t3_es7sf5,1579736888.0,"It's going to help Sanders in the short term because it outrages his supporters. Then it's going to blow over. But it's a reminder that a ton of center-left Democrats can't stand Sanders. The upside for Sanders is that they are less likely to vote in the primary compared to far-left Democrats. The downside is that it's going to be harder to win in the general election. Even in the event of his election, it's going to be hard to convince Republicans (or even moderate Democrats) to support his proposals. On the flipside, Biden is going to have a hard time winning the primary, but would have an easier time winning the general election and getting bills passed.

Despite everyone's focus on individuals, it's always more about policies in the long term. Moderate-left proposals aren't as dramatic as progressives like but they more closely reflect the will of the overall US population. Said differently, moderate-left policies are easier to pass, but aren't as ideologically pure as progressive ones.

The wrench in this classic logic is that the far-right has played hardball and has been able to take control of the Republican party from moderate-right Republicans. So maybe Sanders could take complete control of the Democratic party too. The only catch is that Trump was able to dominate all aspects of government for a while. He had control of the Senate, House, Supreme Court, most governors mansions, and the White House. He lost the House, but still has control elsewhere. Sanders can only execute on his vision if he takes full control of all aspects of government the way that Trump did. Otherwise he'll be blocked at every turn. 

That's theoretically possible, but now going to be impossible to take the judiciary because Trump put in enough lifelong Supreme Court justices to lock it down. More importantly, the Republicans have been laying the foundation for this dominance for 20 or so years. They used big money donations to win local races, gerrymander districts, and stack the deck in their favor. By winning a bunch of small elections, they could change the rules that made it easier to win big ones too. Now they are reaping the rewards. Meanwhile, the Democrats have only recently caught on to this strategy. I'm not sure if it'll be enough to help Sanders or not.

So the most likely outcome is that if Sanders wins, he won't be able to pass his proposed legislation because Republicans will block him. He'll either get stuck with nothing, or will have to pass compromised tit for tat versions of his bills. The compromised bills won't be well planned as if they were written in a bipartisan manner from the start.

Ultimately, Clinton's comments aren't just about the election, but about the long term ability of the Democrats to pass progressive or liberal bills. Sanders infuriates his opponents just as much as he excites his supporters. It's similar to Trump's divisive hate him or love him persona. The only problem is that Sanders doesn't have the complete backing of the Democrats the way that Trump has with the Republicans. Biden aims for more boring or less ideologically pure policy goals, but at the very least his election would undo many of the Republicans far-right positions and add in a few lightly progressive positions."

In globalization, two countries or cultures merge, suffer in the short term, and improve in the long term. In colonialism, one country gets an advantage over the other and extracts everything from the the losing country for centuries.

> When two countries face off and beat the tar out of each other, they’re physically devastated in the short term and people die, but those people will grow back and those buildings repaired.

In colonialism, the people don't grow back and the buildings aren't repaired. The whole point is to maintain a constant rate of extraction. One team gets a small advantage over the other, then takes everything from the losing team. Then the losing team has no resources to rebuild.

For example, in the NFL, two teams play each other in the Superbowl. Then the losing team has a year to regroup, retrain, and then compete again in the future. That's a good thing. But in colonialism, it's like if one team wins the Superbowl, and then takes everything of value from the losing team. They take the best players, the stadium, the TV contracts and other sources of revenue, etc. If they do that, the owner, manager, and coach will never be able to rebuild. If they ever partially rebuild and put together a weak team, they'll immediately lose to the extra strong team the next year. The goal of colonialism is not just to build your side up, but to also keep the other side down so you can keep extracting resources.

The irony is that in the long term, this is bad for both teams, including the winning one. No one wants to watch a sport where one team is completely dominant over all the others. You are only as good as the teams you play against, so if a winning team is never challenged, they can't improve very much. By suppressing everyone in an colonized country, you lose out on every innovation they might otherwise have made. For example, the US's greatest accomplishment was arguably the moon landing, which was only possible because two of the US's worst enemies (Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia) created aerospace technology that the US was able to build upon.

In this way, imperialism and colonialism are terrible economic structures in the long term. They completely screw over the victimized country, but also cap the long term growth of the colonizing country. Plus, they lead to far more violence and wars in the long term. Even if you make a huge economic stride by colonizing someone today, it's not worth much if your country is bombed tomorrow.

3. When it comes to energy, you have to take the full cost into account.

It would be claimed that the productivity of minimum wage workers has not kept pace with average productivity growth, so that it would not be feasible for minimum wage workers to earn pay that rises in step with average productivity growth.

This is the fundamental problem with this argument. Say you and me are farmers. We each grow 10 units of food on 10 acres of land. You invent a tractor and now grow 20 units of food. The average productivity is now 15 units of food per person. But you would get all the money. I'd continue to make the same amount as before. That's what's happening today with tech companies.

The productivity of any individual worker is determined not just by their skills and technology, but also by the institutional structure we put in place. In a world without patent and copyright monopolies, the skills of bio-technicians and software designers would likely be much less valuable than they are today.

The issue is that now many once impoverished countries around the world have now put a great institutional structure in place too. Between 1990 and 2010, a billion people were elevated out of poverty worldwide. US workers did insanely well in the 1950s because all of Europe was bombed out and the rest of the world was still reeling from colonialism. There was huge global demand and very few workers to match. So those American workers made a ton of money. Then in the 1970s Japan and Germany rose and the US worker hit hard times. Now billions of equally skilled people around the world are willing to do the same work as Americans for a fraction of the cost. Unless you think Americans are special based on race, religion, nationality, etc. there's no reason why an equally skilled person in China, India, Brazil, etc. can't replace an American worker.

As a final point, most of the growth is in these developing countries. American corporations are happy to go and do business abroad and take advantage of 7% growth rates in places like India and China. Meanwhile American workers don't leave the US and are stuck with a 2% growth rate.

Ultimately, American workers aren't taking advantage of globalization, automation, and the rising fortunes of once impoverished countries. Capital can easily move around the world, but labor can't (especially because of tariffs, closed borders, protectionism, etc.). As a result, American workers are stagnating.
