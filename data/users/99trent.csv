Theres so many little and big pleasures of life, you cant let your anxiety or depression stop you from living. It is hard but worth it. Eating good to feel good, working out. Going out, seeing friends, talking to people about the weather. its really the small things that release dopamine so when people stay in doors for sake of routine maybe like; wake up; work inside; go home; indoors. 

thats why you should implement new habits to try and become self aware of your bad ones."

13 things mentally strong people dont do - Amy Morin 
4 hour work week - Timothy Ferris 
Models - Mark Manson
also theres so much information on subreddits like these. Id recommend getting into lifting weights aswell, theres something about feeling yourself get stronger. Dopamine that is naturally obtained, rather than the quick fix."
selfimprovement,fc72t2w,t1_fc410ct,1577496021.0,"hey sorry, only just got back onto this Lol, i think i what i was trying to say, 

ive experienced lows, but yeah definitely it helped with those problems. Incorporating a routine, hitting the gym consistently. You see results, results make you feel better about yourself. If you start setting daily targets; +3 push ups today; then actually beat that target. You’ll feel amazing, set many targets and hit them!  its just you have to get yourself out your comfort zone and experience it."
selfimprovement,fc3khr7,t3_efzgmn,1577391816.0,"thank you for sharing this, i agree with many points made. I too have been on a self improvement discovery / journey over the past 8 months following a break up. 

Ive changed so many habits, used the previous 8 months to really get into detail about what i like about myself and what i dont like. 

i find changing habits comes with time and is usually a small change before it becomes regular, eg, eating breakfast, drinking water instead of a soda; an array of juices if you want something other than water. 

The advancement in technology has changed so many things in our behaviour and instant gratification has never been easier to consume, however im still very grateful for the internet as the progress i have made in these last 8 months range from, 

-cutting body fat down to 16%, 
-getting back into reading 
-financial knowledge 
-help with an eating disorder
-cutting out porn 
-cutting out cigarettes / smoking weed 

these changes i have implemented and so much more, i have never felt more energized and great. 

I have suffered from anxiety since i was a child and ive experienced suicidal thoughts and depression. I just wanted to share my story as im so grateful to subreddits and users like you that post intriguing theories that reinforce this type of postive behaviour 

the information is so vast and waiting for you - you just need to take care of what you spend time reading and doing whilst connected to the internet"
