AskPhotography,ff6qmes,t1_ff69gez,1579632837.0,"Charging a proper rate is super important especially if you plan on transitioning to full time at some point. It's easy for part timers to charge less than they're worth because their full time gigs subsidize the cost of running a photography business but you end up devaluing the market as a whole especially if you're halfway decent. On top of that, if you transition to full time you're going to have raise your rates to afford the cost of doing business which makes it awkward for any existing client relationships."

But I just wanted to also say fuck the section that runs through Chatham-kent county. They're too cheap to widen it past 2 lanes even though everything else up to Toronto is at least 3. Yet it's busy enough that you always get stuck for kilometers behind two semis trying to pass each other. On top of that it's always littered with cops radaring from underpasses."

AskReddit,felg0fy,t1_fel7awn,1579221299.0,"This is a common thing with a lot of fruit in stores in my province and I imagine in many parts of North America. Fruit is grown in regions that are more accommodating and plucked before peak ripeness and shipped across the country in temperature controlled trucks. If they were picked later they wouldn't make the trip and rot in stores quicker but they also never fully ripen. For this reason I hate buying strawberries unless they're local and in season. Imported strawberries are a third the price but they taste like nothing.

I've had dragonfruit while in Vietnam and it's amazing."

From a legal copyright standpoint, that's not how it works at all. The new work has to be transformative in some way to be considered a new piece of work or fit the factors for fair-use otherwise it's just a derivative of the original creator's. (Of course copyright law varies from country to country though)

Lightroom,fcsttlt,t3_eipdd7,1577924937.0,"Have you tried going to Preferences>Presets>Reset all default develop settings? That'll make sure you don't have any presets applied at import. From your screenshot, you're viewing an embedded preview from the library module, this is always going to be different to the develop module in varying degrees. During import are you building any previews or converting to DNG

Up until a few versions ago Lightroom didn't make use of embedded previews so you could be seeing a difference as a result of that. Try building standard previews on import or for the files you have imported already and you should see a closer match between the two modules.

Tbh aside from the cropping issue it doesn't look like Adobe is doing anything to your files besides applying it's colour profiles. The difference in the two screenshots is simply RAW vs the embedded JPEG preview. Select a neutral or camera matching colour profile if you want it to match your JPEG preview better. Also make sure your camera isn't set to crop."

PersonalFinanceCanada,fcr2cq7,t1_fcpk520,1577895772.0,"Be very thorough here, a new number doesn't automatically guarantee you're safe. If you forget to update any accounts with your new number hackers can use it to access your other accounts. If they gain access to any account of yours they'll try that same username password combination on everything. A common attack vector is to find email addresses that are being used as recovery emails but that are no longer active (think old Yahoo and AOL accounts) — hackers then re-register that account if it's not longer in use then gain access to their victim. 

So make absolutely sure none of your accounts share the same username password combination. You mentioned they're variations of each other, that's fine but make sure it's not a simple word and different numbers. Passwords can be brute forced using a simple dictionary attack and combinations of."
