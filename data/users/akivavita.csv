creepyPMs,fffr9xa,t3_et1q1i,1579890077.0,Guys online expect saintly replies from women just because they managed to ask gross questions without being entirely vulgar in the process.
thatHappened,ffdjic2,t3_eszc4x,1579822199.0,Who even thinks up this shit?
asexuality,ffdjgvg,t1_ffdjby9,1579822173.0,The fact the book’s editors thought to make that change is what’s more concerning than your professor’s using it. We should be moving toward inclusivity as a profession. It annoys and hurts me to see people drawing lines like this where none was either there before or in any way necessary.
asexuality,ffdj644,t1_ffdha12,1579821987.0,Wow. That’s depressing. We’re moving backwards without the help of a time machine. 😑
cringepics,ffddzz3,t1_ffcisgj,1579818887.0,“Now watch me make any chance of my getting a girlfriend... DISAPPEAR!”
cringepics,ffddwus,t3_esv7dy,1579818836.0,Don’t give the smug little bastard satisfaction of so much as a glance. That face screams “Mommy never payed attention to me and now I’ve got attachment issues and seek any form of attention I can get.”
Tinderpickuplines,ffddkj2,t3_esqgno,1579818633.0,I would just tell her that I think her earring is really dope. Cause her earring is really dope.

CreepyPM,ffdcr16,t3_eswvi3,1579818124.0,"You read him the riot act, girl! Way to go!!"
asexuality,ffdcf6s,t3_essdbl,1579817917.0,I have never seen Maslow’s Hierarchy mention sex. Only ever blanket “intimacy” (or sometimes “romantic intimacy”). That must be an old textbook.
creepyPMs,ffc4ih0,t1_ffc410k,1579791331.0,"My guess is when he didn’t get a response from the first message he was “testing” to see if the explicit message got him a reply faster. It’s happened to me on dating apps before, too. Instead of considering the much more logical option that someone is just busy and obviously sending a second message means the time you wait between the first or the second and the other person’s reply will be shorter, not that the contents of the second somehow made the person reply faster."
NobodyAsked,ffc45t8,t1_ffc277y,1579791091.0,Okay. Thanks for the advisement!
NobodyAsked,ffb9zlq,t1_ffb2n8g,1579756781.0,"Okay. Yeah, I hear you. Is there a subreddit you know of where this maybe would be more appropriate? (Just off the top of your head. Not trying to put you to work but just picking your brain as I’m still new to the format of this site. Thanks!)"

NobodyAsked,ff9yzt0,t1_ff9y74d,1579724529.0,Cool! Thank you for your help! :)
rareinsults,ff9y2pg,t3_esg5k1,1579723989.0,Is Sia in concert?
NobodyAsked,ff9xsim,t1_ff9xevm,1579723818.0,"Okay. I appreciate the input! There’s a flare that’s “kind of asked” that I could add, if you think that would avoid similar confusion from others?  🤔 But yeah I think he was just trying to stroke his own ego either way. Either to set an example for me or just for himself - who knows."
meme,ff9xaai,t3_es9hqh,1579723513.0,It’s a cover up.
NobodyAsked,ff9wwv1,t1_ff9wrob,1579723283.0,Still learning Reddit. If this violates I’ll delete. Felt like the guy was name dropping artists rather than actually trying to engage with me about my work.
creepyPMs,ff7ybqs,t1_ff5uaox,1579661264.0,Mostly just makes me want to lose my lunch

insaneparents,fcktuje,t3_ehig4f,1577733062.0,The best is when enablers get mad at you for not assisting them in continuing to enable an abuser.
