I drove an old Olds Ciera that was pretty long in the tooth. Had some faded areas but being white, it was not obvious, but I did have a ding in the bumper (thumb size) and if you got under it had the common Illinois Cancer - undercarriage rust inside wheel wells and under quarter panels. It looked ok, although by looking at the style it was obviously a 20 year old model if you paid attention to those things. 

I got the same thing only not in writing, they wanted plausible deniability if I complained to any employment law or regulating entity. The partner who pulled the short straw pried just like the douche in the letter. I told him that it ran perfectly, it had only 80,000 miles as it sat in a garage for years, I had no payment to add to my bills, I had a fuck-ton of medical bills to pay, and I wasn‚Äôt fucking taking on a $300-700 payment because the partners wanted me to. And I didn‚Äôt, but there were a lot of shitty remarks and glares forever after till I finally HAD to get something newer. The undercarriage rust? After a few years it had spread into frame. My son took it to his shop and put it up. The frame was a hairsbreadth from snapping whilst driving. If it hadn‚Äôt, I would have driven it longer."

But wait - there is a worse weaponized toilet device! I am sure you have seen those ‚Äúfancy‚Äù wooden seats (why?). Do you know what happens when they get some wear? My rental house years ago had one. At a certain point of wear, the patterned oak strips or seams the seat has, get loose. You cannot see this. It looks like the seat is just great. Till you sit down. The pressure of your ass makes the worn seam or seams part just a little. You do not feel this. Till you get up. As you rise, as the weight of your ass lightens, the separated area snaps shut like a bear trap. You scream as you feel the agony of a piece of your butt cheek is pinched in the unforgiving jaws of solid wood. You leave the toilet either missing a chunk of ass and bleeding, in agony, or with a big long, narrow hematoma (bruise) that is equally painful just not bleeding.

They DID kill dogs here with contaminated treats that they shipped here, they DO give a huge market to rhino poachers because they believe ground rhino horn is a version of viagra, feeding the wholesale killing of a fragile species, and they DID poison their own babies by cutting formula with melamine for some ignorant bid to up profit on the product. The above does not even include the dangerous and poisonous levels of lead they send us in some of the toys they make for import here. 

It isn‚Äôt racist to say they help support the poaching of animals who are dwindling quickly, because they do. It isn‚Äôt racist to say they poisoned our dogs, because they DID. And it isn‚Äôt racist to point out they harmed and poisoned THEIR OWN CHILDREN with the adulterated formula just to up the profit margin, and then there is the lead which I would imagine is not only in some of our imported toys, but the toys that their kids get as well. How is a laying out of facts, not superstition, not blatant racism, but actual facts, racist?? It would be racist if I said all Chinese carried typhoid, or all Chinese were of subnormal intelligence because those are blanket untruths or superstition. Saying they did what they actually DID is just fact."

The boys‚Äô all made their maiden video game voyage with Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto - Vice City. None of them are serial killers of hookers, cop killers, nor car thieves.

Keep in mind, this is a video make by an older fellow who lost all the friends he was trying to lead out of the fire on THE ONLY ROAD OUT of Paradise. A little shaky, but you will get the enormity. There are a couple spots it gets black for a few seconds, not censored just operator error (the poor older guy). He shows his friends‚Äô skeletons in the cars where they died. It was heavily redacted but Inside Edition showed a bit of it. The guy‚Äôs nephew (? I think - a relative anyway) posted it. He said his uncle thought everybody needed to see the reality. Inside Edition‚Äôs cut is on YouTube too, and it includes a short interview with nephew and a quote from fire chief in answer to the pearl-clutching blossoms. He said the horrific nature is exactly why people NEED to see this. This is a catastrophic fire. Not something to fuck around evacuating."
Iamactuallyverybadass,fekp6mi,t1_feklksi,1579204726.0,"I will see if I can find it. It made a huge stink when he put it up. Maybe YouTube? I just read the story wherever I had found it right after the tragedy, and it had his video, he was shaking and seemed to be crying as he panned over skeletons half out of their cars, caught by the massive inferno. Burned out cars, many with people still in them just as they were caught, too late. Skeletons on the road. It was brutal. It received a lot of outrage from the delicate blossoms, and what little played outside of that original video, was shortened considerably and so heavily edited it really didn‚Äôt have much of the effect. People should have seen it. PGE is paying out a fortune to the families of the dead. So many dead, the fire decimated the whole town for the most part. People died in their homes and driveways, it came so fast."

Actual stoner hippie slacker types wore raggedy bell bottoms, tee shirts (extra popular were the band or concert  shirts), flannel shirts or vest type things over, and a prominent, unmistakeable, fog of weed smoke aroma anywhere within 10 feet of said stoner.

He was on that road and when he realized he was going to be incinerated, he bailed and rolled/ran down a little ravine and laid in a creek. A CREEK, not a 6‚Äô+ deep concrete pool, and lived through it. That fire went right over him in that creek, he received some burns from the heat passing over him, but he was not seriously hurt. He emerged and walked down this Hell Road, where all there was was death and destruction. Now THAT is truly Bad-Ass. I saw the phone video he took later, walking that road.
