When I worked at a restaurant we just wiped down the tables with a watered down cleaning solution and called it a day. Took maybe two minutes. The tables aren't actually clean, they just have to appear that way.

He did tell Diana that her apartment reminded him of the first time he got divorced. I agree though, his main motivation for seeing Diana was to grieve over Rachel."
