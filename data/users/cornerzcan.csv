YouShouldKnow,ff9x6ww,t1_ff9v992,1579723455.0,"One thing to note about your comment is that the 110% traction number you mention is from the ASTM standard that defines what a winter tire is. So, an All Weather tire is a winter tire that is deemed by the manufacturer as being suitable for year round service. 

Using availability of tires sizes as a means of determining if All Weather tires would be a distinct category doesn’t seem sound, given the restricted sizes of summer tires that are available - both summer and all weather tire sizes are dictated by market forces. 

Using Tire Rack as the denominator of relevance of the All Weather designation isn’t particularly accurate. Perhaps a look at [Michelin](https://www.michelin.ca/en/browse-all-tires/)  or [Canadian Tire’s](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/automotive/tires-wheels/tires.html?adlocation=LOL_TiresSCLP_MegaNavAuto_19309_en)  websites, or a Scandinavian vendor would elicit a better source, as the relevance of such a tire in those markets is much greater. Both Michelin Canada and Canadian Tire subdivide All Weather tires as a separate category. 

But in the end, All Weather tires are distinct from Summer, all season, and winter tires in that they are deemed suitable by manufacturers for use all year, which is a unique capability from the other categories mentioned."

The gel can be either milky or clear and is often mixed with other water heater deposits such as scale, rust, or tiny sediment particles.”

If my neighbour decides to, as an extreme example, pave their entire lot except the house, this will change how water is shed from their lot, and adjoining lots would need to cope with that surplus water.

YouShouldKnow,ff6wqps,t3_erx82t,1579636466.0,"Additional electric (edit - also gas and oil powered units as well as I’ve learned today) hot water heater maintenance tip- replace the sacrificial anode in your tank regularly and your hot water heater may last literally forever. 

  Electric heaters are equipped with replaceable sacrificial anodes that, due to the properties of the metals used, create a situation where the anode corrodes before any other metals in the tank. This prevents your tank from rising out.  Most of the sediment that you flush from an electric heater are the corrosion by products from the anode . 

Once these anodes are fully corroded, then the tank will start to corrode. These anodes cost around $25, and are usually located at the top of the tank. Removing them yourself can usually be done with a long wrench or breaker bar and socket. 

  It’s best to not drain all the water from the tank, but you do need to relieve the pressure and drain enough water that it doesn’t pour out the top. Having the tank 90% full means it’s heavy and won’t move around as easily when you remove the anode. 

Once the anode is replaced, then flush the tank as recommended."

Step two - wait for the oil to shimmer. You will notice the oil start to move in the pan on it's own.

Step three - crack the egg and let it sit.

Step four - make sure the area of the pan the egg is getting flipper onto is oiled. Use a metal flipper, and work around the edges. If it's sticking, again, add some oil.

Step five - flip gently.

Then serve when done to your desired level. To clean, I just use a plastic brush and some water. if it's horribly stuck, a low heat and some water will loosen it up.

Check out r/castiron for more info. Just don't be afraid to use the pan. Soap won't hurt it. Rust won't kill you. And there are dozens of acceptable oils to season a pan with."
castiron,ff4jt9z,t3_ergb7o,1579565333.0,Maybe add a bit of oil to the pan before the flip of the egg. Mine does this when I've not got enough oil in the pan.
Justrolledintotheshop,ff4h2g8,t1_ff4fpnm,1579563437.0,"Personally, no. But one of my family members is actually the local  service coordinator for an international rental company.  They certainly expect you to follow proper service procedures. Cracking the bleeder while compressing the caliper piston is the proper service procedure. Forcing fluid backwards through the ABS pump isn’t a good idea."
Justrolledintotheshop,ff4fkry,t1_ff4efvw,1579562420.0,So you do the job wrong? I mean the brake fluid is covered under shop supplies?
Justrolledintotheshop,ff4eefj,t3_erjga3,1579561632.0,Any reason why you didn’t crack the bleeder and bleed the old fluid out of the calipers instead of pushing it backwards through the system?
CanadianForces,ff4bj8f,t1_ff3ys2g,1579559756.0,"I agree with you. The hard part is that the CF should also be staffed and funded to do this.  With manpower and finding in place, it would remove the ad hoc minor taskings that are needed to pull people together. 

It’s almost like we need the civil assistance units that were one part of the plan but never came to be."

Also, since the holidays are over and we are watching network television again, the tv is displaying its limitations with up scaling content to 4k. It’s hard to ignore the jumps in the image as the processor tries to keep up. 

Hopefully this gets fixed in the next few weeks, or Costco will be getting this television back."

Using a vessel to block and force a course change of an opposing vessel is a less hostile action when you consider the use of force spectrum that military and paramilitary units generally follow."

For those who aren’t aware, heating the zinc gasifies it, and breathing that in can cause metal fume fever which can be fatal."
