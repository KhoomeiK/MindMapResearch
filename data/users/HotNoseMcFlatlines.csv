wikipedia,fcypake,t1_fcyodeh,1578084338.0,"> We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes.

It's worth noting that as someone with bipolar disorder, under the [same law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Sterilization_Act_of_1924) I might have been sterilized too as a ""mental defective.""
