Are we supposed to respect the scientists who work for the Olympics, or are they full of shit? I'm fiercely confused."
neoliberal,fffzj8q,t1_fffytsn,1579895216.0,">You are certainly aware that the Olympics etc divides sports by sex because woman are not as fast and strong.

Uhh. Something like that...

If we're going to offload our reasoning onto the Olympic committee--which I'm totally fine with as I'm not a sports expert--then it'd be nice to also point out that their latest official ruling on trans athletes is [*permissive*](https://stillmed.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2015-11_ioc_consensus_meeting_on_sex_reassignment_and_hyperandrogenism-en.pdf). 

Their most recent attempts to tighten the restrictions on trans athletes have stalled due to disagreement.

Strictly speaking, flash pods were adjusted in Iceborne so that there's no longer a hunt-long resistance to them, either, it's just that you can only flash a monster once per zone whereas before you could flash a few times but the monster would build a resistance for the rest of the hunt."
MonsterHunterWorld,ffex9gz,t3_et9kj1,1579869204.0,Brightmoss has always existed to knock down flying monsters. It used to require aiming for the head (to 'blind it') but since Iceborne I'm noticing it's much more lenient now with where you hit on the monster.
