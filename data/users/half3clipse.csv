Lots of people go out and even buy the stuff needed to learn an instrument, but lack the motivation to stick with it and learn, since their desire is less than the hurdle needed to get there. And of course in both cases when people reach that hurdle they often get discouraged or feel like it's something they can't develop the knowledge to do and drop back into their default.

your partner might intellectually be happy to help, but not be very good at organizing their cleaning or keeping track of what needs to be done.  

My point is more that when you ask partner to develop that skill, you're asking them to step well outside of their norm and do something for your benefit. Your not quite asking them for a favor (since it's a reasonable thing to ask them to do), but you're still asking them to extend effort they wouldn't otherwise, and you need to communicate what you want to get like an adult.  

For most things in a relationship, it's pretty uncontroversial that positive encouragement is the best way to communicate about your needs, and have your own contributions acknowledged. But for cleaning (and childcare), the default is shame and condescension. Any other topic and that would be treated as some pretty textbook emotional abuse instead of normal."

No it's a matter of giving the person a reason to learn the skill. 

Women are more sensitive to uncleanliness not because women are taught to clean and men aren't, but because  any  uncleanliness is considered an utter and complete moral failing on behalf of whatever woman is adjacent to it at that time. That social programming creates a huge incentive to learn in order to avoid getting shit on and shamed. 

Men don't get that same form of basically abusive programming. You'll get shitheels that expect women to do the cleaning, yes, but more often they don't expect the cleaning to be done at all, they just don't care. 

Which means you want your partner to start doing something that they don't care about. And that's fair to expect, a functioning relationship is based on that kind of compromise. But quite often women try to use the same 'teaching methods' that got used for them, eg. passive aggressive shaming and condescension, cause that's what they spent 20+ years getting thrown at them on a constant basis so clearly their partners problem is actually just a moral failing, right?

You have this problem because you're insisting on parenting your guy like he's some sort of unruly toddler, rather than just working with the fact he's more inclined to let household chores sit. 

Women are more likely to be sensitive towards that  not because men don't know how to clean or refuse to clean, but because you as a woman have gotten 20+ years of programming that says if your place is untidy it is a utter moral failure of you as a person, where when men are a bit cluttered it's just...accepted.

The more you insist on parenting him rather than acting like an actual adult, the worse your problem will get.  Your asking for him to do something you want, which he doesn't care about.

Yes. As long as you're within the atmosphere the only effect is to increase or decrease your speed relative to the rotational speed of your starting latitude.

That sideways motion causes wind resistance that opposes to the motion. That has the effect of slowing you down. Once it slows you down sufficiently that your airspeed relative to the rotation of the earth is 0, the  Coriolis force disappears. The atmosphere does the work. Similarly when you go in the other direction, the atmosphere does the work of accelerating you. In both cases there is work being done, but it's being done by the atmosphere.

Capitalism  is an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit. 

Trade and industry in China is controlled by private owners for profit, although there is also a heavy dominance of state power.


an oligarchy is power structure in which power rests with a small number of people. Quite often that small number of people are within family groups, and power is inherited within the family. 

After Mao dropped dead, political power in China passed into the hands of the so called 'Eight Elders'. Deng Xiaoping,Chen Yun,Li Xiannian,Peng Zhen,Yang Shangkun,Bo Yibo,Wang Zhen and Song Renqiong. Thanks to them and their blatant nepotism and cronyism, much of the political power, as well as control of state corporations became concentrated in the hands of their descendants and others extremely close to them. Their decedents, as well as those of a handful of other people of political prominace in china today make up much of the poltical elite of China and are collectively referred to as 'Princelings'. Everyone's least favorite winnie the pooh cosplayer Xi Jinping  is one of them. 

A feudal society  is more loosely defined, but it's historically characterized by a set of obligations among the warrior nobility, specifically between lords, vassals and control of fiefs, as well as the obligations between the three estates of the realm.  Neo-feudalism generally dispenses of some of that, specifically the 'warrior' part of the warrior nobility, and largely just tosses the clergy out the window, leaving just the nobility and the peasantry. It also tends to not be concerned with control of land, but more modern measures of wealth and  economic power (eg corporations). 

China very much has a functional noble class, that jealously guards it's position and power. Advancement through the political ranks in China is accomplished by way of patronage, service and reward, exactly as with the historical system of lords and vassals. Loyalty is rewarded by being given control of modern analogues of fifes, such as powerful positions in state corporations. For a handful of elites they find themselves in powerful political offices where even those corporations need to pay subservience to them.

explainlikeimfive,ff8e6b8,t3_ertczx,1579674710.0,"OK so, I'm going to try to make this as ELI5 as as possible, but since this is quantum mechanics...hold on to your hats and asses cause it's a long way down. 

  Within the quantum realm, the concept of something have a definite position does not exist. By the same extent, the idea of 'motion' in the classical sense does not exist (motion in the classical sense is change in position). there's not a little sub atomic ping pong ball bouncing around, and F = ma just goes right out the window. 

When dealing with quantum mechanics, the analogue of Newton's law is Schrödinger's equation. Just as F=MA can be used to  predict how a classical  system will evolve over time following a set of known initial conditions, Schrödinger's equation allows you to do the same for a quantum system. 

However as mentioned, we do away with classical concepts like position, and instead deal with the quantum state of the system. Getting into what makes up a quantum state is probably like a bit much, but just as in classical physics, there are certain quantities that (coupled with the laws of physics) allow you to predict how the system will change. 

An example of a classical system is a single ball in a room. The position and momentum of the ball describe the state of the system, and if you know the state of the system and you know your physics, you can tell how that state will change. eg, if it will bounce off a wall and what direction it will go in after that, and etc. A quantum state is more complicated to deal with, but the same concept. If you know all the appropriate quantities and you know your quantum physics, you can predict how the quantum state will change through space and over time.  

The quantum state of a particle is given by the wave function. However the wave function by itself is difficult to work with. The value of the wave function at any point point in space and time, but it's a bit difficult to work with. instead we often work with the square of the wave function, which gets rid of the complex numbers you deal with when working with the wave function.  It can be shown that 
 (at least for ELI5 purposes) the square of the wave function is proportional to the probability of interacting with the particle at any given point in space. This gives you the probability density function of the particle. 

If the the quantum state changes over time, the  probability of interacting with the particle at some point in space may change, which is how motion works in a quantum sense. As said it's not a little subatomic ping pong ball: As you watch an electron move from one point to another, you'll find that at first it has a quite high probability of interacting with something at the starting point and a very low probability at the final point, and then later it has a very low probability of interacting with something at the starting point and a very high  probability at the final point. And intuitively this *is* obviously motion, the electron is clearly moving through space, but it's not motion in the classical sense of ""it was at exactly point x,y,z and is now at point a,b,c"". 

When an electron is in an atomic orbital, it's probability density function  is *independent* of time.  Around the atom, the probability of finding the electron at some point is always the same. IF you could some how stop anything from interacting with the atom, it doesn't matter if you observe the probability density right now, one second from now or 40 years from now, it would be exactly the same. There is no motion in anything close to the classic sense. 


One of the things that trips people up is the difference between talking about the wave function and talking about the probability density function. As said the  probability density function is stationary and does not change, so if we're is talking about the electron in terms of the probability density function,we describe stable atomic electron states as ""stationary states"". If you're question is something like ""so if I take a measurement, where do I find the electron"", that's just fine. The electron even acts like it's spread through that space. It's charge isn't localized to one point, but smooshed out over the region of space.  

However if we're talking about the wave function of the atomic electron it's more complicated, and at that point any classical sense of motion completely goes out the window. The wave function still vibrates and the more energy it has, the more it vibrates (zero vibration means zero energy and that only happens if the electron is destroyed). That vibration is still a change in the quantum state over time, and just as change in a classical state over time is motion, the change in quantum state over time is motion. But in that case they're talking about the vibration of the wave function and not anything like the classical sense of ""change in position""."
explainlikeimfive,ff89m6a,t1_ff84sm3,1579670079.0,"It's a wave in the electron field. It's not an analogy, the exact mathematical description of an electron's probability distribution is given by the wave function. For a free electron, the wave function is dependent on both space and time because the electrons quantum state evolves over time.  If you've dealt with plane waves in the past, go look up the time dependent Schrodinger equation for one spatial dimension. You'll recognize the math. 


When you do the analysis for an electron located around an atom, you find that the wave function is independent of time. A wave where it's value at any point in space is independent of time is a standing wave."

Given a choice between a longer flight, when you basically have your own armchair in a small room, vs a shorter flight where you're in a cramped and loud aircraft, people mostly picked the slightly longer flight. especially post 9/11, where the flight time is now less of your total trip time anyways except on extremely long flights. Same reason those people people will pick being driven around in a Rolls over being driven around in a Ferrari basically


That kinda left Concorde without a market. Couple with the increases costs of operating it and... the Concorde was on lifesupport towards the end. The crash in 2000 finally killed it."
AmItheAsshole,feve4rk,t1_feucelu,1579396388.0,"> waiting until marriage statistically increases your chances of staying happily married 

you mean the study deliberately conducted by a research at Brigham  with a whole bunch of statistical bullshit designed to force that result? Sex before or after marriage has little impact on long term relationship.  The divorce rate has gone up because society no longer forces people to stay in shitty relationships. 

The closest anyone has shown to any real effect, is demonstrating that when people have a relationship for the purpose of having sex, it's probably not going to be a relationship you keep for life. Which is obvious, you're there to fuck, not have a life partner. This also has little bearing on how happy a person is with their life. Fine if  you don't want to have a relationship with someone just to have fuckbuddy, but you're not having a happier relationship for it. 

Also something to note: at this point, almost no newly wed couples are virgins. Like less than 5%. When you do comparison studies with only younger cohorts...the effect shows no increase. The arrow of causality goes the other way.  People who take relationships less seriously are more likely to have premarital sex, and have less stable relationships. 

> Kids not taking sex seriously leads to teenage pregnancy and stds.

Purity culture bullshit guarantees increased rates of teenage pregnancy and stds. If you want you kid to get knocked up at 15, it's probably one of the better ways you can do that (being poor also helps). As a sexual philosophy, it is littrealy the single worst one for dealing with that.

Also  yea, calling it a massive hypocrite peddling abusive bullshit to minors has everything to do with OPs post. Frankly he'd be NTA if he through that shit up on every billboard across from the church let alone on facebook"

That's not the issue people are taking here. 


A slur is still a slur. Some other gay woman who has zero interest in 'reclaiming' the word should not have to be exposed to it. Any LGBT person should not have to be exposed to those sort of slurs in gerneal unless they've explicitly chosen to engage in that same reclamation. The environments in which reclamatory usage is acceptable are relatively small and generally quite personal. And while you could have a whole discussion about what environments are appropriate, the workplace absolutely is not one of them."

The issue people have here is that she's gone full evangelical, and wants to lead a 'sexual purity-themed retreat for the church youth group.'


Evangelical purity culture is straight up abusive, that views women as disposable after sex, and every guy as a barely constrained rapist. It's shitty horrible propaganda that has a long history of fucking people up. 

She's TA for doing that *at all*. The fact she's doing that, but also lying to make herself appear to be a paragon of 'sexual purity' compounds that further. 

She can go be a born again virgin in the privacy of her own home. Pedaling that fuckery to minors is inexcusable."

Anyone who wants to lead a 'sexual purity-themed retreat for the church youth group' is by default TA, and deserves to get dragged on general principle. Anyone who wants to do that, while also blatantly lying about their own activities in order to make themselves out as a paragon of that 'sexual purity' deserves to be roasted over it until a nice char develops."
RedditLaqueristas,fetsobk,t1_fetk74b,1579379601.0,"So they're particularly looking for easy removal. Like for some people in the group they need to be off in anywhere from 6 to 48 hours, and they're going to go through like a dozen sets each over the course of a couple of weeks (short version since it's supposed to be a secret and people know my reddit account: theater thing). Bit of a concern that the repeated glue->removal with that frequency will do bad things to peoples nails. 

Also when looking for nail glue, there don't seem to be any products that are meant to be temporary. Lots and lots that tout how they'll last for a week/s, but not many that are 'yea this will come off really easy after an evening' 

Someone else mentioned a peel off base coat, and it sounds like the current plan might be to experiment with that and also some liquid latex. Which also means making sure to find a nail glue that won't react weirdly with the latex/base coat."

When you don't make your mac out of kraft dinner it has a fair bit of structural consistency to it, especially after it's cooled a bit because there's enough cheese to glue it together. If your arteries need to be put in their place, you can actually slice cold mac and cheese (yes slice) and then pan fry them. Also better quality pasta goes a fair ways, since the starch out of the pasta also helps hold it together. 

It's no harder to eat than any 'loose' sandwich. If you can manage pulled pork, or tuna salad you can manage this. It is an absurd amount of caloric content, but that's rather the point. 

Also if your going to give pretzel buns shit....just go sit in a corner and be wrong. The only better burger delivery substance is brioche, and then only some time.s"
