aww,fdzr135,t1_fdxm02q,1578793822.0,"There were some American guys in a Bad prison in Mexico for drug charges. They got beat up until their parents paid off the prison. Finally the guy escaped in a dress and implicated them. This was in around 1974. The movie ""Escape"" covers it. I went to Med. School in Mexico in the early Eighties but I'm not proud of it. Also visited Acapulco twice in that timeframe. I refuse-in principle-to ever go back. They like your money down there...but they don't like YOU."

AskReddit,fbgteov,t3_ed8irn,1576858165.0,"The most important thing we can do, IMHO...even if this Does not happen-is to breed a race of midget humans. I mean-THINK about it-if we are all Tom Thumb-one foot tall and 15 pounds-we use up Much less resources. We can travel in electric toy cars, and 5000 of us can fit on one Transoceanic 787. Less goods hauled in the Walmart trucks.  Climate Change would still be an issue from the cumulative decades of CO2 already in the air. Growing crops would be the most important issue. Raising cotton and lambswool and weaving clothes are important, too. We would have to dip into our Scientific knowledge to recreate prescription drugs.  In reality-there are very few infectious agents that could cause such an Epidemic. Conditions don't exist for The  Black Death anymore, and it's treatable with antibiotics. If we had all been Bisexual or shared needles, we WOULD have all Died of AIDS a Generation ago, before it was treatable.
