Because it has nothing to do with the topic of discussion. Again, being able to keep the discussion on topic is one of the reasons I want to do it in writing.

>How can I control what a wolf does?

You could capture it to physically prevent it from doing things you don't want it to do, or you could simply kill it. Like I said, that's what we do to prevent them and other predators from threatening us, we simply remove them from existence.

>I'm against using and commodifying animals. I can only control what I do.

And yet a few posts ago you were talking about abolishing the wool industry and wiping out all domesticated sheep. Sounds to me like you want to control a lot more than just your own actions.

>I would like to stop predators from using other animals. It's still not a logical entailment of my position though. I don't think that not killing predators results in me having a propositional-logic contradiction with my position on the matter. 

It kinda does. You want to kill sheep to prevent them from suffering, yet you don't want to kill wolves that cause such suffering? I can't say I really follow your logic.

>It sounded like you were saying it was impossible to do but it turns out it is possible. I was attacking the idea that it was impossible to do.

A lot of things are technically possible that are not realistically feasible. If you thought I was saying it was literally physically impossible, you misunderstood (and it must've taken you a lot of effort too).

>Tell me where I said slave owners justified it. 

Do you not know what a rhetorical question is and what purpose it serves? Because either you do, in which case you're being disingenuous now, or you don't, in which case you're shockingly ignorant and there's no point having a discussion with you until you learn the basics of how discussions work.

>Ye. I know. I asked ""Is it ok to enslave them?"" to find out your position on the matter and you dodged it completely. Maybe you missed it.

Because it's again irrelevant to the question at hand. You keep trying to derail this, which indicates to me you have no argument.

>That's fine. I'm a patient person. The people in the discord server I participate in give people all the time in the world to respond. We understand questions might take some time to answer, especially if the other person hasn't thought about it, and we won't harp on them for taking time. They just have to do it on voice chat. It separates the men from the children.

That's a very childish view.

>Not bringing sheep into existence is not removing them. 

You said they should be made to die out by preventing them from multiplying or even outright culled if necessary. Lying about what we said again, are we? Continuing this discussion seems more and more pointless with every reply, since most of my responses are now just calling you out on your attempts to derail.

>What I want to find out is whether or not me performing the action of running a Guatemalan child meat farm would be morally acceptable under your moral system.

If you don't consider ""no"" to be a clear enough answer to that, that's your problem.

Honestly, you asked this question, I gave you a clear answer. You asked it again, I called you out on repeatedly asking until you get an answer you like. And here you are, asking again. And you insinuate that *I'm* the child in this discussion? Bitch please."

Because there are a lot of farms.

>Is it something about the job? Does it attract sickos? Does the job itself make people this way?

A little bit of everything, I guess. If the job involves hurting animals (such as killing lab rats or chucking baby chickens into a macerator), people totally do become desentisized to it. And I'm sure some sickos are attracted to these jobs, same as some abusive assholes are attracted to becoming cops.

>Why cant the people just spend hours waiting for the sheep to relax so that way they can be shorn?

Plenty of videos exist of that too. Well, not the waiting, that would be boring, but humane and gentle shearing. Good news is not news, it doesn't get any clicks.

>Does this work in a human context as well? Do you see any difference between a human getting slaughtered by a human compared to getting eaten by a wolf? ""So from the point of view of the animal there is no difference."" Same with a 1 year old Guatemalan. They dont see a difference.

That would be why we don't let people get eaten by wolves, primarily by removing wolves from our vicinity by killing them.

>It seems with this I get to justify anything done to anyone so long as they get to live in civilization. Do I get to justify everything?

Depends on what you mean by ""justify"". From your point of view, yes, you can totally write any sentence along the lines of ""because of X, Y is justified"". From the point of view of others, whether they accept your justification or not, that depends on their own views on the items you include in that.

>Why is this a point you are focused on?

Because that's the point you were focused on when you thought you had an argument there. Now that it's turned out you don't, you're trying to move away from it.

>Let's say all the sheep that currently existed right now disappear except for 2. How does this influence your position on whether or not it is morally acceptable to breed sheep into existence to be used as a product?

That's again moving away from the topic of what to do with individual sheep in a world that includes lots of sheep.

>We can provide for as many sheep and other farmed animals as possible and euthanize the others if it came down to it and then from there we never breed any animal into existence again. You are fine with them having their throats slashed. I can't imagine you'd have a problem with them being euthanized.

That's not euthanasia, that's culling. And I'm unconvinced by your logic of preventing animal killing by killing all the animals so that there are no animals to kill.

>Individual items..? Whether the package overall is good or bad..? What are you talking about? How does this point even relate to your position? I'm so confused. Can you write this point out in a complete sentence or a different way and also include how it relates to your position?

I'm talking about the point you brought up, that some slave owners justified their slavery by saying they 'civilized' the slaves and provided a 'better life' for them, which you compared to me making a similar point about animals. You expected me to balk at that and admit how wrong I was, but when I rightly pointed out that some of the slaves did agree with that view, you got stumped. So now you're acting like you don't know what this is about.

>That's not even a logical entailment of my position. Im against the use and commodification of animals. How does a wolf hunting a sheep mean that I'm commodifying or using an animal?

What, wolves are allowed to use sheep but we aren't? Why?

>If people cared about non-humans to the point where they didn't treat them like objects then we would be the ones paying for those supplies. Or rather a mixture of some people paying for the care and some actually providing the care. We already do all that shit to begin with. At that point people would be donating time. We can also subsidize it.

I mean, yeah, we could do this one thing. But there's a whole lot of other things worth doing as well, and we can't do them all. What you're asking is abandoning all the other worthwhile stuff in favor of your own pet idea. Also, by ""subsidizing"", I assume you mean with tax money? Taken from other people by (a threat of) force? Careful, you true colors are showing.

>What does that even mean? Are you saying it would be an immoral act? Are you saying you wouldnt like the sound of it but aren't gonna do a thing about it? You think you are being clear with some of your responses but you aren't

That obviously means ""no"". Which is what you asked for, a yes or no answer, so I pointed out that I had given it to you before. And ""no"" is as clear as it gets. If it seems vague to you, that's on you. I'm done answering this question, I'm not going to repeat myself again.

>In regards to a comment you responded to earlier you didn't even explicitly say no when I asked if it was ok to enslave black people. It sounded like you justified it instead. 

No, you said some slave owners justified it, and I agreed that they did, and pointed out that some slaves agreed with them. I said nothing about my own position on the matter. See, this is exactly why I wanted this in writing, because whenever people are pushed into a corner, they try to weasel their way out by lying about what was or wasn't said. This way I can just scroll up to check and call that BS right out.

>I have a feeling you are biting bullets to stay consistent with your position. I want to ask you questions in real time to see if you freeze up and to be able to hear your tone and how exactly you respond.

If by ""biting bullets"" you mean actually giving things some thought, yeah, I am. I consider giving things some thought to be a virtue. And yeah, I'd totally freeze up, because I'd be giving things some thought. What you really want is to be able to rush me and get me to misspeak so that you can go ""gotcha!"", and that's exactly why I'm not going to allow you to do that.

>If it were the case that you don't think being a different species is the reason that it is morally acceptable to do what we do to animals like sheep then I'm trying to figure out what you think the reason is because it sounds like the reason you think what we do to them is morally acceptable is because you think it is fair. I disagree with that notion. So do you hold that position or some other position?

I don't know that I'd describe it as ""fair"", it's more that it's no worse than what animals do to each other. You said you're a deontologist, I'm very much a consequentialist. And I don't think we make the lives of our animals any worse than they would be otherwise, on the contrary. The slavers' argument holds water in the case of animals, because their lives are improved by domestication and they have no concept of liberty and bondage, so the downside isn't there.

You seem to think that we should end suffering by removing the things that suffer, which is a very Peta way of looking at it. I still haven't killed myself, so I obviously think that life is preferable to no life. Even if it ends in death anyway, possibly quite a painful one. There's no guarantee that I won't get hit by a drunk driver and spend a whole night lying in a ditch in excruciating pain before expiring. Am I going to remove myself from existence to prevent that from happening? Hell no. You don't seem to have done that to yourself either. So why should we do it to sheep?"

Again, you could just as easily point to a few videos of cops beating (or hell, *shooting*) innocent people and conclude from that that we should abolish the police. That's literally your logic here. That ""so?"" is entirely appropriate, and I remain unconvinced by your logic.

>I didn't say destined to die. I said destined to be slaughtered. A slaughterer slaughters someone. In the case of farm animals and sheep the human is the slaughterer. You said die as if it's the same thing. There is a difference. Nobody chooses to be slaughtered. The sheep don't want to be slaughtered; no one does. They are being killed against their will. 

Very few choose to die at all. And accoring to you, no animals. So from the point of view of the animal there is no difference. I see no difference between being slaughered by a human or eaten by a wolf, other than that the human usually tries to make it as painless as possible, whereas the wolf doesn't give a shit and eats its prey while it's still alive. If you want to prevent people from slaughering animals because the animals don't want to be slaughtered, shouldn't you also want to prevent predators from hunting? Which is to say exterminate them, because there is no other way to accomplish that? I'm 100% confident in saying no sheep has ever chosen to be eaten by a wolf, so grab your rifle and let's go hunting some howlers. Point is, your viewpoint is self-contradictory.

>Uhh...what are you saying?? Why would the truthfulness of a claim depend on how much they value freedom? If the claim is they were treated better than africans then it's either true that they were treated better than africans or they were not treated better than africans. What does valuing freedom have to do with this?

Well because depriving someone of their liberty is pretty poor treatment... buuuuut you get to live in civilization in return. You're getting a package deal, good and bad, and whether the package overall is good or bad depends on how good or bad the invidual items are, which is a matter of opinion.

>What we could do is stop putting them in scenarios where they can breed. We could separate the males from females, or neuter and spay them and then there wont be any sheep thrown in the wilderness because the domestic species will stop existing. 

I guess, but that's not addressing the point of what to do with an individual sheep that is not profitable anymore.

>We could also not throw a sheep into the wilderness and instead provide them with food and water until they die naturally, not by a knife.

We could not, because someone would have to pay for that food and water and shelter, of which there is a limited supply. It's that pesky entropy again, I'm afraid.

>Ye I can.

I didn't think I had to explicitly say ""without making yourself look like a hypocrite"", I thought that part could remain unspoken, but I guess not.

>it's morally acceptable for me to farm Guatemalan 1 year olds according to your moral system, right?

What part of ""I wouldn't approve"" did you not understand? Or did you just not like that answer, so you're asking again hoping for a different one?

>Your morality system leads to some interesting reductios.

No, your ridiculous caricature of it does.

>we can debate on discord using voice chat. This text stuff takes too long

>Is it it not the case that they are destined to be slaughtered once they come into existence? 

Yes, of course. Every living thing is destined to die, most of them by being eaten alive. Humans are one of the few animals that actually kill their food, a lion or an eagle is perfectly happy to tear bits of flesh off its prey and eat them while it's still very much alive and struggling. So, y'know, I don't think we're *that* bad, all things considered. Though you're probably going to respond with a video of some asian guys putting a monkey's head in a vise, cutting it open, and eating its living brain with a spoon.

>Make sure to watch the parts of the videos where the sheep are humanely stabbed in the throat. 

If I could choose the way I'm eventually going to die, that one would be pretty high up on the list. Instant loss of blood pressure to the brain and therefore a very quick loss of consciousness? Sure, compared to a lot of the other possible ways of dying, some of which include *days* of excruciating pain, that one doesn't sound so bad.

>So could I use this same exact justification to start a humane free-range Guatemalan child meat farm?

I wouldn't approve, but I can't stop you, so I guess you could.

>Non-human animals are comparable to children in intelligence. How many human children (like 3-8 years old) per year neck themselves? 

A brief google search shows that quite a lot, apparently suicide is anywhere between the 2nd and 4th leading cause of death in chlidren, even very young ones (first graders), depending on which source you believe. And apparently they also understand death pretty well by that point.

>Any and all forms of the life that arent human

That's not quite true, sheep for one would suffer a lot since they depend on humans for a lot of their needs and protection. From an evolutionary point of view, becoming domesticated by us is an excellent survival strategy for a species. It would also be very bad for literally all life on Earth in the very long run, since we're already halfway through the Sun's lifespan, at the end of which it's going to expand and incinerate the planet unless we do something about it (which we totally can, see Isaac Arthur's futurology channel on youtube for details).

>They might not stop producing wool but thats not what is important though is it? What is important is whether or not the cash produced from selling the wool is greater than the cash expended keeping them alive, right? And surely the profit also has to reach a certain point or else it isnt worth it (they could farm something else or someone else). And perhaps it's the case that as they get older they produce less and less wool. Maybe a few coats worth but less and less nonetheless.

I mean, I guess? So? If you don't produce, earn money, and pay your rent, you're going to be tossed out too. Nobody's going to kill you, of course, but throwing a sheep out into the wilderness is a death sentence anyway, so might as well spare it the suffering of being eaten alive by a predator.

>I bet some black people were treated better than the ones in Africa. Is it ok to enslave them? Do you think a slave master ever used that kind of justification before that you just used? ""Well they are treated better than these ones""

Of course they did say that. Was it true? Depends on how much you value freedom, I guess. Some slaves did agree with that, to the point where that became a whole character archetype (Unlce Tom). BTW, who do you think actually enslaved people in Africa? Whites? Hell no, they couldn't be arsed to actually go inland and snatch people, they just bought the black slaves from *other blacks.* So, y'know, not such a black-and-white issue (heh).

If you look at any individual piece, sure. But overall, on average, statistically speaking, plastics kill lots of animals (and likely humans, but again, no research). Same as air pollution, where we do actually have numbers on how many hundreds of thousands of deaths each year it causes, even though each particular puff of smoke from a coal-fired power plant seems harmless on its own.

>There does not need to be any animals brought into existence to be used so that way a plastic product can be created. There NEEDS to be a sheep in order for wool to be created.

I mean, sure, but that sheep is not being harmed by being used. I can see the argument for meat animals, where using them means killing them, but not really for sheep. And sure, that sheep didn't ask to be brought into existence, but then neither did I or any other living thing in the history of life. If its existence really was unbearable suffering, it could choose to cease to be, same as you or me. If you've ever had a pet die from a serious illness, you know animals can do that, they'll stop eating and moving and just wait for the end to come.

>It would be a net positive if all humans burned in hellfire and died.

Net positive for whom?

>Some farmer jacks off a male or uses a machine to do that and then collects the semen and then forces that semen inside a female. You really think farmers are waiting around for a male and female to fuck...? Time is money.

Artificial insemination is mostly used in cattle and pigs, where yeah, like 80% are artificially inseminated. It was used a lot like sixty years ago in some regions of the world (Eastern Europe), but even there it's been mostly phased out. This comes back to the difference between sheep and meat animals. Yeah, if you're constantly killing off your animals and you need replacements on a schedule, you don't have time to wait around. With sheep you're not in a rush.

>So even you admit a plastic product being created will not guarantee an animal dies. It all depends on certain factors. And just a little bonus to think about, it's totally possible to never throw away a plastic product, right? 

Yeah, just like it's totally possible to never commit a crime, but I'm sure you'd object if your country decided to abolish its police force. I'm a realist, I look at what's most likely to happen, not the absolute best possible scenario. The reality is that plastic being produced means plastic being thrown away and that in turn means animals dying from it.

>What do you think happens to a sheep when the sheep doesnt produce a profit? Do you think the farmer a) wastes money keeping the sheep alive or b) kills them for a little bit more profit?

Eventually yeah, I guess, though I don't really know if sheep ever go bald with age and stop producing wool. I still think their lives are overall much better and longer than those of their cousins living in the wild."

Depends on where that plastic ends up. If they ingest large bits of it, yeah, they can easily die from that. And we still don't know what health effects exactly microplastics have (hint: probably not very good)."

That's an economist's view, which mistakenly assumes human beings are rational and logical. In reality there's all kinds of ways people can be made to pay for things they hate, from propaganda (i.e. advertising) to addiction-causing mechanisms (e.g. loot boxes, slot machines, etc.). The result is that the most successful companies in capitalism are not those that produce the best quality and value for the consumer but rather those who are best able to influence or trick people into paying for sub-par stuff (that's why planned obsolescence exists and cheap knock-offs tend to be more successful than high-quality originals in many industries)."
