grammar,fehiwc7,t1_fehdg90,1579117459.0,"I'm one of those people who reads, speaks, and writes English based on how I *feel*, if you know what I mean. 

And for some reason, to me, the first one seems to mean something entirely different than what the writer wants to say. Only the second one sounds right to me. Not more right, but the only one right.

Is there an explanation? Or should I just stop being a noob and learn actual grammar? Thanks in advance."

pcmasterrace,fdxqqkn,t1_fdwmj4e,1578771933.0,"Ikr. I played the game very seriously and really got into it as if it was me who wes stranded on that planet. So when *spoilers* the weapon was disabled and the rocket was ready, there was just no reason to stay, as much as I wanted to stay and explore more.

After the rocket was ready, I did try to just roam around a bit but it just felt so weird putting my life at risk when I could just leave. I know it's a game but it's more fun when you get immersed into it."
