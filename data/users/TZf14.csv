They do have their market, but my point is that most of them are overpriced and a lot (not all) people buy them because they are apple. And people trust apple. I like apple, (I have an iphone) and I wasn't attacking anyone who uses them. The only reason I am commenting here is because you said macs were for professionals. They aren't. Apple doesn't make macs for pros. Macs aren't bad, but a professional can get better products that can do more for cheaper if they got a PC. i never said the mac was shitty. seems you were just butthurt that I have a personal prefrence for PCs and disagreed with you. With every good argument I made, you didn't strike with one back. Unlike other people, YOU didn't give a reason to use a mac. this is my last post in this comment thread because honestly  I have other things to do then argue about a Mac.

Apple sells products for way more then they are worth. ""Pro"" isn't really ""pro"" because its the only one so that argument makes no sense. And you shouldn't be paying for a mac with some of that pricing being the way it is because they have retail stores that most people won't go to.

While some artists use it because they can't sing, a lot of artists use it as a creative effect. You may not like the sound, but that doesn't make it bad. Some artists can sing but use autotune for creative purposes or to fix small mistakes that could have been fixed by singing, but autotune was used to save time. Even if either of those are sometimes a problem doesn't make the entirety of music in the past decade bad. Not everything is a top 40 hit."
unpopularopinion,ff1u9cb,t1_ff1qs7n,1579486318.0,"Really? Good Faith was my album of the year (2nd album of decade behind worlds). 2nd album of the decade. Adventure didn't feel like a really great album, it felt like a great collection of singles. good faith was a great album. It had a full focus with a concrete beginning middle and end. With adventure I think you could have shuffled all the songs around and (besides the intro feeling out of place) it wouldn't make a difference. Good Faith Improves on that. It also is just way more enjoyable for me with better melodies and production. But hey, just my opinion. (I kinda went into mini review mode) But it's nice to see someone else agreeing."

porterrobinson,fep4o0l,t1_feod6w0,1579312050.0,not necessarily. That is mastering quality.

\-The album's slow progression and sometimes sluggish feel  
\-The sudden transition from the pop and intense EP's to vertigo's slow vibe kinda threw a lot of people off.  
\-It was kind of forgettable.   
\-the lyrics weren't as good as I wanted them to be.  


Of course I have a lot of things to praise about it, like it's amazing and genius production in songs like crash, or the aggressive and truly emotional singing in Take care, and the experimental production in float, to the surprisingly uplifting and energetic love (not wrong), but vertigo was a first attempt for a new EDEN sound which Jon hadn't fully got the hang of."
porterrobinson,fep3d2s,t1_feo9zeg,1579311219.0,porter just needs to get it pressed somewhere else. But that will never happen sadly. you just gotta deal with the pops and enjoy the mastering. Sea of Voices has a MUCH better and less compressed master on the Vinyl record for example.
porterrobinson,feo5jtq,t1_feo2tlh,1579295422.0,"The popular opinion and experience is that the mastering was really good but the pressing was bad. I had Sea of voices, Natural light, and fresh static snow with problems. Everything else was at least ok."
