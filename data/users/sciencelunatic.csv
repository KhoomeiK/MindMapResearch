Anxiety,ffpt2a8,t1_ffp277n,1580104664.0,"You know, as much as I appreciate this comment... if only it was this simple. I don't really eat junk. I overeat on healthy food when I have panic attacks. Like chicken breast that I have meal prepped for the next 2 days. I counted my calories as an experiment without restricting and it turns out I ate 3500-4500 calories every day. Healthy food is also bad for you in excessive amounts.

I was able to lose 20 kgs when I restricted my calories to 1800 a day. It's not even the 1200 a lot of people do with cico. I needed to go 20 kgs more. But I was only able to do it when I took a break from uni and had my boyfriend physically restrain me whenever it happened. I had 20 kgs more to go. Studying is one of the biggest stressors for me. And this September, I am going back for 2 more years and then a PhD. I love academia and I love teaching too. I realized I wanted to be a researcher and it would not happen without a degree.

A lot has happened since then, for example I was finally diagnosed with ADHD and finally had an explanation for certain things I was struggling with that seemed easy for others. I eat food during my hyperactive episodes. I remember using food during high school as a way to stay focused for hours to be able to finish my homework and prepare for my exams.

I used to go to a psychologist who specialised in weight related issues. She broke up with me recently and it was devastating. It happened during a really bad time. I was in a really dark place and when I opened up about it she said that she can't handle the issues I have. It's devastating because I went to many psychiatrists and psychologists before her and none of them clicked. I don't think I'm ready to start over again.

So, yea. I would really appreciate advice on my issues, not just a generic 'don't eat junk food'."

I do not believe in bad luck or that wishing for someone to suffer will actually lead to any results, however it sounds like you do, so think about it this way: if karma is real, it knows the whole truth. If bad people wish bad things on good people, you know who it's going to go after. :)

vim,fdl13al,t3_elxhb3,1578515201.0,"I love vim and I suck at it. I still mix up and use the arrow keys instead of hjkl. I will press j 10 times instead of typing 10j... Don't even get me started on people typing 8$&$!#-#gsbeifuekai and it turns javascript into python or some shit. I just turned on set mouse=a and syntax on, added some plugins like youcompleteme and I use vim like I use any GUI ide. It's great for sshing into machines and having your IDE up and running. I have my vim config on github so it is super easy to get started on a new server. It's also great because it is minimalistic and I love using the terminal too."
socialskills,fdkzo1p,t3_elwuu2,1578514442.0,"You try to hang out with them more. You ask them personal questions about their life, you bring up deep subjects, emotions, family issues. You also share the same things about yourself with them. You support them when they are going through a rough time and in turn ask for support when you need it. The other person will pick up on your bond strengthening over time. It's emotional intimacy. People who share their good and bad times together end up together a lot of times. I see a lot of people getting it wrong by either not letting the other person share or by not sharing themselves. It is a balance, both sides are equally important so the relationship doesn't feel intrusive to any one of the people."
