I should an ""equal treatment"" example and, as you've pointed out, it's not a realistic solution at all.

> they want their children to have an advantage.
> 
> Is that wrong of them? I'll bring up an argument I made elsewhere: How is this any different than a public school kid receiving private tutoring? He's benefitting from public funds, but he has now also paid for the privilege of receiving a better education than his peers.

I don't want to fund a private school to give ""in groups"" an advantage over ""out groups"". That's a publically funded avenue to segregation of society along certain lines (race, religion, what-have-you).

Public money comes from everyone, so it belongs to everyone. That's the socialist aspect of pooling resources in a nut shell. I want to fund public schools because I want educated citizens. They're more able to deal with the complexities inherent in living as a citizen of a nation over the member of a tribe.

Public funds for private tutoring in a public school is different because public school boards are elected offices, so people have a democratic say in who gets what.

Also, I actually have ZERO objection to the existence of private schools. I just don't want a single cent of my taxes funding them. If you want to send your kid to a private school, you pay for it, 100%. Not me. I'll pay for everybody else. You take your kid out of a public school, then my tax dollar goes farther. Also, YOUR tax dollar still goes to funding public schools. That's a world where, if you want to claim privilege of wealth, you can't complain about how much things cost."
moderatepolitics,ffc8jfe,t1_ffbz4ae,1579793985.0,"I would go along with your view but certain problems would have to be addressed first before I'd buy that.

First, all schools have to be funded equally. Period. Full stop.

If you're not willing to fund absolute funding equality, then you are arguing FOR some sort of discrimination, not against. There's no way around this.

So, a school that takes public funds AND accepts private funds, in the form of tuition, corporate money, or religious money is funded better than a school that only received public funds.

To solve this, you first have to establish a ""per student"" funding baseline. No school *of any sort* can be funded below this line.

Once this is established, you have a way to enforce this equality. The state, in concert with a survey of all schools that accept private funding, will establish the ""per student"" rate. Schools that are funded only by public funds will receive this amount. Schools that accept private funding will have their public funds reduced until they receive this aggregate amount. Schools who's private funding exceeds this amount, will be taxed and the money they are taxed goes into public funds for education.

In addition, schools are not free to reject students. They're free to teach whatever religious value they want, but they are not free to exclude students.

And there you have equality.

Which is NOT what people running religious schools want at all. They want their schools to be elite. They want their students to be special. Elite private schools and the parents that send their children there don't want to be equal, they want their children to have an advantage.

Kavanaugh's argument completely fail because the whole point of private schools, no matter what, is to give ""certain"" children an advantage over others. The whole point is to further inequality.

I don't think public funds should be used to produce greater inequality in opportunity.

Life (or God if you prefer) equally distributes talent, but not equally distribute opportunity. Private schools are a way for those who lack talent to succeed through increased opportunity."

Did they allow guns at Trump rallies before he was President (of course they don't now due to the Secret Service).

I know they don't allow guns at CPAC.

Protest all you want, just follow the same rules as a Trump rally: scream and shout, but *you* can't shoot. Let the police provide security because they'll be there in force, apparently."

Of the millions of people who spend tons of money on skiing, but don't win anything, or spend money on World Of Warcraft and don't win anything, or spend money on painting supplies but never sell a painting, or spend money on a piano but never make a dime from playing the piano.

These people just like the activity. It doesn't matter to them that they win no money and there is no monetary gain.
