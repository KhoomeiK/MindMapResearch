SuicideWatch,ffdy80v,t3_et3ee9,1579831891.0,"There is more than one way to leave it all behind. Peace corps, military, mission trips, moving, university. It may feel like you're our of options. Often there are many we just can't see. You might think it's not worth trying, but what do you have to lose?"
SuicideWatch,ff4wziy,t3_ero13a,1579574457.0,"Depression tricks you into thinking your worthless and that you don't deserve Better life. And it is a hard fucker to beat. Sometimes you just need little wins. To feel better for a few minutes. Then you might get a day or two. And eventually, you may get weeks. For me, the music I chose always brought me back in. It's like I wanted to be miserable. If exercising gave you those moments, hold on to them. If it didn't, try a different hobby.

Remember that bettering yourself doesn't mean get stronger, get smarter. It means acceptance, it means doing things for yourself, doing things that give you those moments."
SuicideWatch,ff4vejc,t3_ernqpv,1579573365.0,"If you're posting this I think it means you haven't told them how bad it is for you. If you think it's bad for them now it will be so much worse after. 
If you haven't, read r/SuicideBereavement/

Guilt from that subreddit isn't a reason to live. I'm hoping it becomes reason to find a reason. There are so many things in life that might give you a chuckle or a smile. When you feel miserable sometimes that's as good as it gets. You try for one or two moments, then maybe an hour without crying or feeling terrible. But if you try hard and get lucky it turns into a day or maybe a week. 

It sounds stupid, but have you tried reading the book the Martian? It's not a self help book. It's just funny and a good way to spend a few hours. If you have a few hours give it a shot. My goto line is ""what do you really have to lose?"""
SuicideWatch,ff1sqj4,t1_ff1qvzc,1579485343.0,"Sounds like it's time to change therapists then. Most people find it difficult to find the right therapist. If you don't trust them it's likely a waste of time. Don't feel bad about trying 2 or 3. It's like dating, but with no sex and it's 4x as akward.

*it's not a waste of time, it's just not going to be as easy. I can't tell you how many times I reread these hoping they say something helpful in the right way."
SuicideWatch,ff1rnd5,t1_ff1pndo,1579484659.0,"Everybody is different. Many of the people here who post more than ""don't do it, think about your loved ones"" have been through their own version. My guess is quite a few found someway to cope. 

I've been depressed most of my life. Played Russian roulette, had my stomach pumped from ODing on anti depressants. I was in Iraq in 2007, and helped drop bombs and launch troop in contact missions against people who really just wanted a better life for themselves and their kids.

It's sounds stupid, but a funny book like the Martian helped me. Just something to help take my mind off my problems for a few hours. Then it became the thing I was excited to get back to. That doesn't work for everybody, but what do you have to lose?

If you already read The Martian, and you didn't laugh you may be doomed"
SuicideWatch,ff1qc5s,t3_er5csm,1579483831.0,"No one blames you, and you shouldn't blame yourself. You won't feel better until you believe that. 

Ptsd is tough, but giving in will add one more victim. We are here for you, but you will need more than anonymous redditers. Do you have more than us to talk to? 

Is it pretty in Norway now? The sunsets there are some of the best. I lived in Drøbak for a year and I'm not sure I will ever live anywhere as beautiful."

SuicideWatch,ff1opiv,t3_er5j4u,1579482794.0,"For many it comes in waves. From alright to awful and back. No one can look from your perspective. They can only do their best to guess. When everything feels terrible the best you can do is hold on to fleeting moments. It's not always enough, but they are usually there if you look for them. 

I would recommend you look at r/SuicideBereavement to see what peoples perspective is like after a friend or family members suicide."
SuicideWatch,ff1luzs,t3_er4r0m,1579481312.0,"The truth is you decide that. No one gives your life true meaning. You could try to find a few happy moments where you can get them. Once you get a few moments look for an hour or two of happiness. It comes back slowly, if you choose to look. 

 Are you into books at all? Try reading the Martian if you haven't already. It's not an inspirational book, just a fun read."
SuicideWatch,ff1jr10,t3_er4r4j,1579480299.0,"It's your choice, but wouldn't it be more fun to just up and start a new life? Join the military, the peace corps, volunteer for mission work, go to college. There are a lot of ways to leave it all behind, some involve just moving to a new place."
SuicideWatch,ff1j94r,t3_er4rdc,1579480083.0,"Hopefully the future version of you is the person replying to people, trying to help them find some hope.

 Not many come back and explain they are better because they aren't sure it will last. Or the change was so gradual that they don't even realize they don't need this place, they just stop posting. Never give up hope"

All other people want is for life to go back to normal. For the pain of loss to just be forgotten. But it doesn't"
SuicideWatch,ff1hdfi,t1_ff1cau6,1579479248.0,Good luck. It'll be tough. Write down things before you call if you think it will help.
SuicideWatch,ff1cy5o,t3_er49sm,1579477577.0, You might want to seek out a male therapist to help you. Sex and professional accomplishment are not intertwined.
SuicideWatch,ff18j0h,t3_er42n5,1579476302.0,"Not sure who told you to reevaluate your choices, but you should ask yourself if you get up in the morning to impress them. Live your life and be proud you made it through the difficult times. It's not easy."
SuicideWatch,ff110g3,t3_er3g2j,1579474172.0,"It sounds like you are being pretty hard on yourself. It's not always easy to find new friends, but a good way to find them is to pick up new hobbies. People really get into model making, wood working, video games, board games, dungeon and dragons, or geocaching. Look for local clubs and go a few times. It's going to be awkward at first, but hopefully fun. 

It also sounds like communication can be difficult. When it's something difficult to talk about you could try writing things down first. It gives you a chance to work out what's important and keep you on topic. Really successful people keep a notebook with them and write down and read from notes all the time, even at home with friends. 

And you may want to consider leaving your girlfriend. If she's toxic it could be worth letting her go. That might sound scary, but if she makes you feel worse. Be sure to talk to her first! Tell her how you feel. Even if it's over text message. If you are too hard on yourself you may have stopped yourself from some fun without realizing it."
SuicideWatch,ff0k6hm,t3_er25ut,1579469624.0,"I think money will be the least of her issues. It's terrible to read through, but there is r/SuicideBereavement

Have you told her how hard things are? Often the people we hide from are the ones we should talk to. It gets to the point we convince ourselves that it wouldn't help, but in situations like this what do you really have to lose?"
SuicideWatch,fezvpm4,t1_feztjst,1579462272.0,"You have plenty of time. Lots of people change as they go. You should think about it now though. You might be able to find a project to join and could provide a fun goal. For brushing your teeth, you could bring your toothbrush in the shower. I turn the water on and just sit in the shower until the hot water runs out. It's not so hard to brush when you don't have to stand up."
SuicideWatch,fezpym6,t1_fezo8yk,1579460192.0,"What do you want to do after uni? Video games, Robotics, database, security? I got my CS degree and didn't realize how many different jobs there were."

SuicideWatch,fezlr77,t3_eqze8x,1579458741.0,Some Dr's suck. Same with some dentists. Find a new one. Write the issues down. Consider keeping a journal with descriptions of pain and locations. It may be easier to get the issues addressed that way. Mouth pain is absolutely miserable

SuicideWatch,fezi6bt,t1_fezf5i5,1579457634.0,"I'm not sure of your situation, but moving out might be a good move. Join the military, goto college, volunteer with the peace corps, ask an aunt, uncle, grandparents, cousin, friends family if you could stay with them.

I picked up 2 jobs so I was only home to sleep. Not possible for everyone and had its own issues, but you have almost infinite options. Some should lead to a better life.

SuicideWatch,fezcyxv,t3_eqyh3h,1579456035.0,"Have you ever read books about existentialism? There are a lot of YouTube videos too. It really only makes more questions, but it made me feel better for some reason. A few of the books describe life as completely absurd and pointless, but it also gives you a new sense of freedom. You could try the stranger by Camut or maybe Bojack horseman on Netflix if you are interested"
SuicideWatch,feza8mg,t3_eqyjcd,1579455272.0,"Anyone who answers lived through it, either because they found a reason to stop, they did it wrong, or someone saved them.

I think a better question is what little things can you do to find some happiness. Just moments of happiness, until they work their way into hours of happiness. I don't know if you are in to books, but try reading the Martian. It's not a self help book, but it's funny and a good way to spend a few hours. If that helps any, then pick a new book or look into a new hobby. It's the little stuff that gives life some happiness"
SuicideWatch,fez4p6i,t3_eqynnf,1579453828.0,"The universe doesn't care if you are miserable or happy. There probably isn't an overall meaning. Life is, in the end, pretty absurd. It also means in some ways you get to choose how you feel about it. It is a sort of freedom."
SuicideWatch,fevzc85,t3_eqq92n,1579403380.0,"It's probably time to stop then. New music, no gory videos. It's a feedback loop that will drive you further in. No one can stop you though. You have to choose. 

It sounds stupid, but try watching PS I love you, the time traveler's wife, children of men, the fountain. Read books that deal with existentialism. It's got a different feel, but it can fill that drive in a new way."
SuicideWatch,fevx27k,t3_eqq9wf,1579402559.0,"It's incredibly hard to do it, but you need to tell someone how you feel. Someone close to you. If you haven't already then you are not in a corner with only one way out."
SuicideWatch,fevw7g8,t3_eqqb5b,1579402205.0,"BPD isn't easy, but it isn't always a curse. Many people get lucky and find a way to use their focus and determination to throw themselves into something they care about. Their anger is fuel towards success. It doesn't solve everything, but holding out to watch one more movie, to wait for one more birthday, or to read one more book is waiting to see if things change. You will have more chances to become happier if you go looking for things that make you feel that way. Also consider Bob Ross videos, they help me when I'm so angry my chest hurts"
SuicideWatch,fevsecv,t3_eqqe2r,1579400882.0,You won't know unless you try. You will have to try and fix the issue and try out each new day. Not everyday will be better.  look for good moments when good days are hard to come by
ElizabethWarren,fefuoxa,t1_fefszgw,1579065784.0,"I feel Bernie and his followers (among many others) have done a lot of good establishing ground work and have developed previous platforms that made it possible for Warren and others to campaign with a similar messages with less backlash.

HomeImprovement,fdqcq9o,t3_emqsrx,1578663147.0,I think you need more information. Is the window installed with a nailing fin? If so is the siding easy to remove around the window. Does code require impact resistant windows in your area? I would expect a window install to cost between $300 and $1000 including the window. Lead time could be a few weeks waiting for the window to arrive if not in stock plus a few weeks if there's a queue. Call home depot or Lowes if you want other quotes. I find they are pretty reasonable.
HomeImprovement,fdqbp6g,t3_emq2v1,1578662264.0,"Try something simple like WD40, if it doesn't make things easier you should consider moving or dremeling the plate.
