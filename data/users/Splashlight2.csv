disability,ffdp3mh,t3_esuqps,1579825623.0,I feel disabled physically and mentally. After my suicide attempt I now feel like I'm too slow to be a good worker. I have balance issues added on. The only thing keeping me going is waiting for my service dog to get here.

unpopularopinion,fdx1h0d,t3_en52cm,1578764319.0,"Well I'm very extreme in my thoughts. Its hard to find people online who agree with all my views, or as vehemently as I do. IRL I'm the only one, my husband thinks I'm way too extreme. 🤷🏻‍♀️my friends can't even believe me."
unpopularopinion,fdwz246,t1_fdvm7a0,1578763719.0,"That's my old best friend. She'd be so anxious she couldn't shower when her dad was awake bc she was scared he'd be mad at the noise.... He's never yelled at her. She was terrified of everything. She wouldn't go inside my house bc it's haunted. Even though all my other friends do. She cried when she went to an Asian festival with me bc she felt that everyone was staring at her bc she's white. They weren't. At my grandma's funeral, she wouldn't stop talking about how upset she was that she was white and my family wasn't and that they were probably staring at her. So I spent the whole funeral comforting her. There's a ton more examples, but basically, I told her she has generalized anxiety disorder and to talk to a psychiatrist but she said she wasn't ""that"" anxious & ""it's not like I'm in an asylum."" We're not friends anymore because she's racist towards her black boyfriend. When he first asked her out she said she wasn't sure if she could date him bc he's black, & then she asked me if the Bible approved of interracial couples. She's not religious at all btw. She doesn't even know the story of Adam and Eve. But anyway, she kept talking to this black guy & finally he asked her out again and she said ""ok because ur not like all the other black guys."" Tf?! and he's always fingering her & eating her out but she's never even seen his dick, and definitely never touched it. They were dating for a few months but immediately after that, he barely came around anymore, & now he's cut off all contact with her for going on 2 years, and she says it's bc he's getting a new phone but I don't think so. He did this with his ex too. He's too scared to tell the ladies when hes done."

antinatalism,fdu380s,t3_emxn1w,1578726730.0,"I am rooting climate change bc I'm pro extinction of everything bc everything feels pain. Animals moreso than humans. & Since I like them more than us, id naturally want to save them from pain more than us.

Saving the planet for me means complete & utter peace, which we can only attain once everything is gone.

I don't give a shit about human progress. I just want it all gone.

I'm an efilist and a promortalist.

I think everything is pointless. Its just pain & more pain, & then death. I consider myself a humanist though, bc thru all this, I just want the best for everything. And I'm a huge animal lover."

DebateAVegan,fdpniqa,t3_emicad,1578633756.0,"Cons legal, vegan.

It should be illegal so that it saves animals from murder & torture. The PACT act should have included hunting & factory farming. It states that cruelty — specifically crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, impaling or sexual exploitation — in or affecting interstate commerce or within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States a federal crime. Yet among its numerous exemptions are “customary and normal” agricultural and veterinary practices as well as slaughtering animals for food. 🙄 Hm ok. But humans don't need meat to live so really the laws are based only on taste buds. Killing an animal should be no different than killing a human."
promortalism,fdll7y1,t3_e5a5b1,1578526537.0,Promortalism is saying to actively go out & kill yourself. Efilism says that it sucks that ur here but u should try to deal. I'm a promortalist. I'm only alive bc my service dog is coming.

Psychic,fdkrmcz,t1_fdi336h,1578509708.0,"No psychedelics help more than antidepressants. That's why they're slowly getting legalized. Like MDMA cures PTSD while other drugs just alleviate symptoms. Same with ketamine. Being illegal doesn't = dangerous. Alcohol is more dangerous for your health than heroin for example. Drugs being illegal is based on institutional racism, not science or medicine."

Psychic,fdi2rzt,t1_fdhp9x0,1578434703.0,No ketamine fixes the brain permanently. It connects wires in the brain unlike any other drug. So in that way a person has the building blocks to getting their lives back on track! I bought 1 gram for $40.

Having a child is always selfish bc the child will never be benefited, only harmed. If you truly love ur child, why would you hurt them? Cause them to experience death? How are you able to do something like that w/o the child's consent? Would you have sex with a person who's passed out, just bc you can't get consent, so technically it's okay? No. So how is it ok to do something like that to a child? This is not about me. This is about every individual soul that has to suffer."
