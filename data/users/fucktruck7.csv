I wish you the best and you are not alone. There is and always will be hope"

offmychest,fdqn0js,t3_eml4h2,1578670516.0,It saddens me to think that a child so young felt that way. I didn’t start having serious emotional problems until I was 15. And at 19 they have still are a prominent part of my life and I truly wish that others having these issues are able to get help and make progress towards feeling better. I’m not there yet and I have been needing to look in to talking with a professional but when I have in the past they made me feel stupid for not being a typical easy to identify patient. My anxiety and on/off depression aren’t very common symptom wise and it’s very hard to assess when these feelings will hit me. When I become a parent my main goal is to be completely transparent with my child about the realities of mental health and make sure they don’t suffer the way I have.
