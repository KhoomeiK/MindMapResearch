History lesson: Veterans returning from WW2 got among other things educational benefits (the GI Bill) and VA loan benefits via the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944.  These were CRITICAL in creating a giant postwar middle class of upwardly-mobile veteran *families*, the children of which were the Baby Boomers.

It is thanks to these programs that the returning vets were able to build the generational wealth that set the Boomers up for success.

But they key here is that *you only benefited from these programs if you were white* which meant Blacks were specifically and intentionally denied the opportunity to climb the ladder and get a leg up.

Now: Nobody here is talking about Viet fucking Nam, and nobody is mistaking Baby fucking Boomers for their World War Fucking II veteran parents.

So if someone introduces you to Elon Musk or the ambassador from Spain you don’t just stick out your mitt, that’s something equals do or superiors do to put their inferiors at ease.

We have and continue to do this to women too: you’re not a “real woman” unless you’re “feminine” or “beautiful” or have kids. And if you’re not a *real woman* then suddenly people can do all kinds of nasty things to you, because what we’re really saying is you’re not *real*, period.

spaceporn,fdd65y4,t1_fdcv8mq,1578296512.0,"Well, I’m not a physicist, but: gravity is subject to something called the “Inverse Square Law” which says that the rate the force diminishes as you move away is relative not to the distance, but the *square* of the distance.  This means that the pull gravity exerts on you falls off rather quickly as you move away.  The corollary is that as you move closer to something, the force exerted increases sharply.

When you have something like a black hole, with extreme gravity, this means that as you fall towards it, the pull in your feet can become MUCH greater than the pull on your head, even though they’re not very far apart. It’s just that your feet are marginally closer to the singularity, but because of the inverse square law, that little distance results in a difference so great that you will at some point be torn in half.

And then your halves get pulled in half, and then all of those pieces get torn in half, and so on and so forth until you are just a long strand of particles being slurped up like a piece of spaghetti.

So, “spaghettification.”

Edit: as for how it feels, probably extremely painful, but you won’t have very long to experience it.  I read online that for a black hole with 10 times the mass of our sun, you would cross from the event horizon to the singularity in about 15 milliseconds (although you’d be spaghettified long before you hit the event horizon), while for the super massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, you could actually cross the event horizon intact and spend the next 16 seconds falling towards the singularity, during which you’d be ripped apart.  Spooky stuff, right?"
