fatlogic,fcihiqz,t1_fcie3hl,1577662641.0,That’s exactly what it is. They’re disappointed by the simple answer.
fatlogic,fcieo1d,t3_ehb9jz,1577661409.0,"They’re not necessarily wrong about the fact that “dieting” causes raised cortisol levels and that “yo-yo dieting” is unhealthy. 

Cutting out too many calories at once and going from doing nothing to doing ridiculous amounts of cardio is going to stress anyone out. Also, with yo-yo dieting, because many yo-yo dieters crash diet and don’t do strength training, they lose muscle and gain fat with every diet attempt, making them unhealthier than they were to start with. 

But the answer to this is simple: Don’t crash diet. Don’t do excessive cardio. Eat healthy. Exercise appropriately. Sleep enough. Learn proper stress management skills instead of turning to food or veging out on the couch. Build up these habits over time and you’ll see the real, healthy weight loss the original writer of the post doesn’t think exists. It’s hard and takes time, but it works. 

Of course, we already know this. That’s why we’re here."
fatlogic,fcapjtr,t1_fc93zi6,1577574012.0,"“Intersectionality” as a term came about in I think the 70s/80s, and was created by an African-American woman who used it to described how racism and sexism compound together to create a host of unique issues for women of colour that white women and men of colour just don’t have. Since then it’s been adopted by people of other minorities/oppressed groups like LGBT+, disabled people, etc., and has finally made its way into the Fat Acceptance community. 

It wasn’t a buzz term to begin with, but it sure as hell is now."
