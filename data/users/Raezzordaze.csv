Truckers,ffh3mc9,t3_etitzy,1579922201.0,"So, this sounds cleared up but for future reference an accident is only considered DOT Recordable/Reportable if one of the following three happens:  
A) Someone died.  
B) Someone was towed.  
C) Someone was treated away from the scene of the accident.

Oh, and someone has to call police to make the report of course. If you hit a wall on private property and get towed to the shop/yard and police never make an accident report there's no mechanism for DOT/FMCSA to ever hear about it.

Fault doesn't factor into whether something is DOT reportable, or even preventable. Fault mostly has to do with insurance, preventable is what safety departments care about.

As for your accident that sounds 100% like non-preventable to me and as long as your DAC has an accurate accounting of it, then it shouldn't be a hindrance at all to future employment. Best of luck!"

Truckers,ffchkzq,t1_ffbxp93,1579799623.0,"Basically that just says that the time spent on PC can't constitute the majority of your break and you still need to have plenty of time to get a good night's/day's sleep during your 10. It's worded a bit vaguely but honestly that's good for us since it gives us a lot of wiggle room.

Now some may argue that ""required rest"" means 8 hours consecutive sleeper but that's only required when doing the split sleeper provision. The regulations on the 10 hour break simply state that it must consist of 10 hours of off duty time, 10 hours of sleeper berth time, or any combination of the two as long as it totals 10 hours consecutive.

The problem you are running into is that on completion of your second break all time up to and including the end of your first break is what falls off your clocks. Any time after that first break still count including the 2nd break if it's not an 8 hour or more consecutive sleeper berth time. If you drive 5 hours, take a 2 hour break, then driver another 5 hours and take an 8 hour sleeper break you don't have your full 11/14 back.

Truckers,feimcba,t1_fei65ja,1579141888.0,"Well, yes and no. Generally, when you get per diem when you are paid mileage they pay you at a lower rate to begin with but give you extra as your per diem reimbursement. So say you normally would get 50 cpm, on per diem you might get ""paid"" 35 cpm but also receive 15 cpm as per diem. Some companies actually pay you less per mile because they are doing you a ""favor"" by handling all the paper work for the per diem for you. Ya, it's bullshit, but there you go.

You could also receive a straight per diem rate per night if you are paid otherwise. In that case it should be a straight ""bonus"" added onto your normal pay rate.

As someone else said getting per diem this way will fuck your finances up as well. Per diem is a reimbursement and is NOT considered income for tax and other financial purposes. While that will lower your tax burden it will also lower your income for purposes of social security, worker's comp, loan consideration, etc."

Some workers  normally report to a number of jobsites each day as part of their  duties; all such time is compensable. If the worker does not have to  report back to the main office after finishing at the last jobsite, but  instead returns directly home, the time spent returning home is not  compensable. 

From [here](https://twc.texas.gov/news/efte/h_travel_time.html). Basically by reporting to the main office you are starting the work day. Traveling to the work location should then be considered compensable time. However, if they allowed you to take the vehicle home and you drove directly to the work location it most likely wouldn't be. I'd at least ask an employment/labor lawyer for a quick consult to make sure and take appropriate action with the Texas Dept. of Labor if needed."
