insanepeoplefacebook,ffr3xzs,t1_ffq7c10,1580149929.0,"Wow surprised to wake up to so many upvotes.  I had surgery years ago then IUDS have been managing it.  I actually have an ultrasound in a few days to see if my IUD moved/ displaced.  I've also been nervous it's dietary.  I've been getting conflicting advice from dietitians about soy.  I'm vegan and live almost entirely off soy. I've had one dietian say this is great and I've heard others say it's not.  It's hard to find a reliable dietian when you've got multiple issues.  So meh.  

I did a CBD bath bomb last night and I'll hopefully get answers in a couple days when I get my ultrasound."

TalesFromRetail,fduj8u2,t1_fdui4b3,1578733916.0,"You have to be 18 to set up a phone plan 21 to buy alcohol. (May vary by state). How can you accept ID that do not have age listed if age is a requirement? If you need to verify address that needs to be there.  I have a list of addresses I'm allowed to accept at my work. They're allowed because they are A. Provided by the government B. Provide necessary information. When I turn customers away for not having proper identification im not being a dick. I have to follow the law. One reason the law is there is identity theft, fraud, and for customer privacy. You have no idea how often people are doing the ""oh it's really my account"" scam without an ID to get into their ex's account to find various bits of information when someone's trying to get out of an abusive relationship. I have a lot of homeless customers and I do my absolute best to point them toward resources to help them get their IDs if I can't help them without.  I had one that broke my heart and i tried for months to help him. But without that piece of plastic my hands are in fact tied."
TalesFromRetail,fdug5g8,t1_fdu8k8d,1578732473.0,"Government ID and legal state ID are different just as state vs federal ID are different. You can't set up financing (ie a phone plan outside of prepaid), buy alcohol,  etc without a legal state ID. People who make exceptions and break said law can be fired more seriously than you would think."
TalesFromRetail,fduf153,t3_en3q2o,1578732148.0,That's pretty standard here.  We point them to DMV to get a state ID.
