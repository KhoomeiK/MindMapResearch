If every human came from Africa, originally, then every place humans live, now, was , at some remove, colonized by Africans.

I still struggle with myself, when it comes to how I view the world, and the tendency to make bad choices.
If your childhood was bad, you have to acknowledge that, and acknowledge that you are going to tend to make bad choices.
