dogs,fehzfpk,t3_ep5jpm,1579126989.0,So sorry Emily and you are going through this.   Sending good thoughts your way.  And hope that’s it’s easy and peaceful for you both.
dogs,fehrldz,t1_fehp3la,1579122482.0,"Yes shocked, her parents and siblings are huge.  I was expecting her to be at least 85 lbs.  Thats what the breeder told us when we picked out of the litter.  
Yes sick to my stomach, worried that I didn’t something to impede her growth.  
There’s no need to learn how to love her.  She’s loved to the moon and back by every member of our family.  A little spoiled too. 
Sorry my post bothered you enough to come across so rude."
dogs,fegd8kh,t3_eoxvm5,1579088517.0,Thank you everyone.  Appreciate your positive thoughts.  It was so much easier those first few months when you could see how fast she was growing.  She’s been such a great addition to our family.  And I know that’s the important thing.  Again thanks for the kind words and advice.
