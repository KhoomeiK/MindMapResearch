aww,fe3tnld,t3_eni7zm,1578852732.0,Dealing with that exact cat and the pounds of fur she has. Doppelgänger cats.
Hedgehogs,fe3ntl0,t1_fe3mic9,1578851168.0,That’s why I love them so much they are grumpy little munchkins. Once you crack her she will be your best friend. She is still a baby and needs time. My guy is Lionel and I can lay down with him and take a nap he stays right with me. I also forgot to mention that they can’t see at all! Their sense of smell gets them through their world. Be sure to use your voice a lot around her. The internet is full of wrong info so find a credible site that understands the biology of the animal. If she is brand new it’s also helpful to let them be in their cage mostly for about 5 days so they can learn their new environment. If you just got her that may be the biggest problem. Let her get used to her new home. So much information to share!
