Same difference, I just said map because you can't see players by looking at the world map.

What's your definition of an instance?"
todayilearned,ffjymky,t1_ffjp654,1580010553.0,"> 12 track album

That's the problem right there. If it was back in the day when people had the CD and listened to the whole album or most/part of it, then 2c per track makes (some) sense. These days is so easy to listen to a single track then flick to another. Lots of people listen to playlists on Spotify so you're lucky to get a song in, never mind a full album. Your model assumes people listen to music on Spotify the way they used to listen to music on CD, which doesn't work."

Guildwars2,ffjkr95,t1_ffj2suh,1580000477.0,I am literally seeing how many people are in a map at any one time. How is it distorted? Why does their physical location make a difference? If anything having everyone separated is going to give you a distorted view of how many people are playing the game.

That study was flawed (one of the authors admitted this) because they only considered transport in action (cars/planes on the road) v farm to fork and not taking into consideration the production of transport vehicles and it's infrastructure maintenance.
