nutrition,ffb6bbq,t3_esnfyz,1579752953.0,"Miralax is just an osmotic that draws water into your system so your best bet to better poop is lots of fiber (psyllium or oats, prunes, veggies, chia seeds are all great) and drink a LOT of water."
EatingIntuitively,ffb61w2,t3_eshoe9,1579752753.0,Everyone in my office is on keto. üôÑ
My600lbLife,ffa4q33,t3_esgz2n,1579727843.0,"I read an interesting article about how spending and eating habits are related. Like if you can think through why you wouldn‚Äôt blow all your money at once, you can also understand why you would not just eat everything because you can. Plus there are the ones like Sean who blow enormous amounts of money on food."
fuckeatingdisorders,ff994br,t3_es5mav,1579707686.0,"Are you me?? Wow, so many parallels to my struggles. I‚Äôm 38 and an engineer, work FT and spend all of my free time compulsive exercising and I restrict and eat all my calories within a 3 hour window. I‚Äôm not underweight and I feel like such a phony but at the same time I absolutely hate my life. I have ruined my intestines with lax abuse and I will never shit normally again. I want help but I feel so hopeless, like I‚Äôm just broken. I‚Äôve had these patterns so long that I honestly don‚Äôt know how to fix them."
EDAnonymous,ff6cw8g,t3_erunje,1579624448.0,I‚Äôm 38 and never got pregnant because I didn‚Äôt think I was capable of not affecting my child with ED problems. I am also terrified of losing control of my body and I think I‚Äôm just better off having pets.
My600lbLife,ff63fq9,t3_ern2a6,1579618165.0,I feel like a jerk when I watch the show and think ‚Äúwhat stress do they have? I have a job and family; they literally just eat and sleep all day‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more to it but really? Stress?
fuckeatingdisorders,ff534hf,t3_ermrmg,1579578928.0,Raw carrots are okay but cooked ones aren‚Äôt. Canned soup is fine if it‚Äôs less than 80 calories a serving but not fine if it‚Äôs 90.
EDAnonymous,ff52yrx,t3_ermdfg,1579578803.0,"When I got diagnosed as AN, my mom told me about her BED and how she felt like a failed bulimic. She was the only person in my life who ever really ‚Äúgot‚Äù what I was going through."
nutrition,ff315e9,t3_erblx3,1579530906.0,"That if you eat low carb/keto, you will lose weight even if you eat too many calories. It doesn‚Äôt work that way."
EDAnonymous,ff1t51n,t3_eqwsm4,1579485598.0,My grandma said they used to do this with sweetened condensed milk. My bet is that that tastes WAY better than almond milk. Lol.
EDAnonymous,ff1szhe,t3_eqx3ko,1579485501.0,Yep. I get so hungry after getting to my LW that I pig out and gain an instant 5lbs.
nutrition,ff1sr88,t3_er4vwu,1579485356.0,The magic of fiber. I can eat a lot more calories if it contains a lot of fiber and not gain weight. I‚Äôm almost wondering if the roughage helps us to not absorb more of the calories.
fatlogic,ff16f2b,t3_eqvvrb,1579475661.0,I buy this‚Äî I definitely underestimated my calories when I was fat. I would eat like 4000 calories a day but assumed I was eating 2000 and the reason I couldn‚Äôt lose weight was my metabolism.
EDAnonymous,few56un,t3_eqo50p,1579405561.0,I make air popped popcorn and put a lot of those Kernel season stuff on it. It‚Äôs not zero calories but it does satisfy me more than say chips.
EatingIntuitively,fefpt6p,t3_eowzlc,1579061796.0,The same reason our ‚Äúpresident‚Äù is a reality TV star.
fuckeatingdisorders,fefpgjt,t3_eopy32,1579061539.0,I was obese and started behaviors. Within about 8 months I was ‚Äútoo skinny‚Äù and people just then started worrying. And by then I was full on into it. I think a lot of us start out overweight or obese.
EDAnonymous,fedjb57,t3_eoimik,1579012967.0,I never am skinny in the morning because I usually binge at night and wake up bloated as hell.
EDAnonymous,fdn7k8n,t3_em54w0,1578579438.0,Yes. My husband steals food off my plate and I wouldn‚Äôt be as upset if he would take the same food from the original container. What is on my plate is mine dammit!
antidiet,fdm9lub,t3_elx8wh,1578543251.0,"I will subscribe and watch all your videos! I love seeing people on t

EDAnonymous,fdj2hbs,t3_elknca,1578456727.0," Yep I totally do this, I weigh myself about three different times in three different spots in the bathroom to make sure that the weight is right. I‚Äôm also a huge dork and I calibrate it with a 10 pound dumbbell before I weigh myself."
fuckeatingdisorders,fdc7a4y,t3_ekkq7v,1578268496.0,"I noticed mainly that I felt better, although I did sleep more too. I had to wear forgiving clothes otherwise I really got triggered by tight pants. Also, my weight went to my stomach first and then my butt and legs later so I looked really weird for a bit."
childfree,fd6z1hi,t3_ek3dhv,1578197484.0,"I know a couple who would not adopt because they didn‚Äôt want a ‚Äúproblem child‚Äù. Their words, not mine. Not like their spawn was anything all that great."
EDAnonymous,fd5xa12,t3_ejwy0v,1578182660.0,Self check FTW. I only buy Miralax now but that‚Äôs embarrassing enough.
fatlogic,fd5wmk8,t3_ek3b3c,1578182425.0,"LifebyJen, a YouTuber who weighs 550-some pounds did an HONEST what I eat in a day and it was like 4500 some calories for not a whole lot of food. She said it really opened her eyes as to what she was really eating."
fuckeatingdisorders,fd00qa6,t3_ejownx,1578111891.0,Not sure what you eat currently or if you purge but doing it on your own can be fatal if you get refeeding syndrome.  You really should be under the care of a team.
fatlogic,fczzzci,t1_fcqf2lk,1578111552.0,Yeah they are. Fortified foods are made with vitamins that are made in a lab. By people. Vitamins that you find in plants and whole grains and meat etc are the same chemically speaking but you also got the phytonutrients and antioxidants you miss in the processed foods.
antidiet,fcwet9b,t3_ej01db,1578023802.0,"When I was obese and losing weight, I had a doctor appointment when I was in the normal BMI range and my doctor said ‚Äú you could lose more for aesthetics but you are technically healthy weight I guess ‚Äú. Why are doctors encouraging that unnecessary weight loss??"
fatlogic,fcweit8,t3_ej6o9x,1578023599.0,I have a history of an eating disorder and seeing my weight does stress me out BUT I get that my doctor needs to know it. The solution? Ask for a blind weight. They have never not been accommodating.
fatlogic,fcp6nkh,t3_ei5j3b,1577852228.0,I once had a lady tell me my arms were like toothpicks and asked if I ever ate. Then she told me to walk to the Burger King down the street and get a Whopper. Like...that‚Äôs totally not okay.
fatlogic,fcp6hh1,t3_eibhqb,1577852064.0,"This isn‚Äôt totally wrong. Those foods do have nutrition, but most of it is fortified with man made vitamins and minerals and are not as good as what you‚Äôd get from naturally occurring vitamins."
My600lbLife,fcp67gr,t3_ei5ce2,1577851793.0,When I was obese I seriously thought I ate 2500 calories a day max. Then I kept a real food log and looked up the calories for everything and it was like 4000 a day. I was gaining at the time but I wasn‚Äôt 300 lbs yet. I think if you are honest it‚Äôs easier to change.
EDAnonymous,fckgoo0,t3_ehjzsv,1577724925.0,I studied biochemistry and microbiology and know more about nutrition than most of my dietitians. It infuriated me when they would lie to me about stuff and tell me I just had to be okay with my body at it‚Äôs set point which was ‚Äúlikely in the higher weight range‚Äù. Like WTF.
fatlogic,fcixr5g,t3_eh89po,1577672354.0,"Food IS meant to be pleasurable. The problem is that most ‚Äúfood‚Äù these days is not real food. Processed food is a mix of corn, oil, sugar, and preservatives to make it last. It‚Äôs good to eat(I guess) but it‚Äôs really not food in my opinion."
antidiet,fcixim8,t3_ehf50g,1577672188.0,I like that opinion. And lots of people who eat Uber healthy all the time still die early from other things.
nutrition,fcixdmr,t3_ehdvsf,1577672093.0,Cholecalciferol is what they use in supplements and it‚Äôs also what they add to milk so it‚Äôs equivalent biologically. The issue comes with how much you take at once because you can only absorb so much at once.
fuckeatingdisorders,fcix2mw,t3_ehdo0y,1577671884.0,"Oh no I am sorry. How awful. This disease sucks, I‚Äôm sorry."
EDAnonymous,fcbxvx5,t3_egrim6,1577592195.0,Yeah every time I eat. Thanks effed up digestive tract.
EDAnonymous,fcbxqqb,t3_egtqaq,1577592148.0,"She was really underfat for a long time and she did change really fast. It will take her some time to get used to her new body, but I‚Äôm sure she has a bit of body image issues considering so many influencers are tiny and shredded."
EDAnonymous,fcbwsir,t3_egw4md,1577591839.0,I stay off the scale this week because I know it‚Äôll fuck with my head. I‚Äôm sure mines mostly water weight too. Lol.
EDAnonymous,fc7gc5b,t3_egiu8u,1577506593.0,It‚Äôs always some 17 year old who was underweight for 2 months and then put IP and is normal again after gaining back the weight. Talk to me after you‚Äôve had 3 or 4 iterations of ED and been suffering 20 years bitches.
fuckeatingdisorders,fc4d0y0,t3_eg4b7g,1577413126.0,Oh yeah I‚Äôm sorry you have an idiot too. My doctor told me to just start eating eggs like that will magically cure me. And when I opened up to her about abusing laxatives in the past she said ‚ÄúWhy would you do something that stupid?‚Äù Gotta love it.
nutrition,fc4cule,t3_eg32kh,1577412982.0,Phosphoric acid and the caramel color in them are really awful for your teeth and will stain and weaken them. Plus sugar if you choose the regular and artificial sweeteners if you choose the diet...nothing at all good in them.
EDAnonymous,fc1a2m1,t3_efkyzj,1577312603.0,It‚Äôs frightening how easily I could crush that 10000 calories challenge. It would not even be hard.
EDAnonymous,fc0uj1y,t3_effpgb,1577300006.0,I had my physical exam on Friday and my doctor was like ‚Äúyou have no fat on your breasts at all and I can feel your intestines. How do you not see that you are very skinny?‚Äù She is a very sweet lady and very direct but yeah...my fat meaty legs throw me off every time.
EDAnonymous,fc0u75a,t3_efj5m1,1577299797.0,I‚Äôm lucky-my husband got me a gift card and told me to get anything I want. He knows how pissed I get when I get stuff that‚Äôs the wrong size.
EDAnonymous,fc0tea4,t3_efiwy9,1577299211.0,My issue is that I took two days off from my full workouts and I feel guilty as hell for not doing them and I keep thinking I will gain a million pounds from this. I freaking hate that I can‚Äôt enjoy Christmas.
EDAnonymous,fc0t5u2,t3_efggcl,1577299067.0,Me!!!! I have such thick stumpy legs that when I‚Äôm a healthy weight they just look massive. Also my belly is huge and I have no boobs. So if I woke up looking like Charlize Theron but weighing 209 lbs I would totally be okay with that.
EDAnonymous,fc0syv8,t3_efh0yu,1577298948.0,For real. This disease has made me do some seriously dumb shit.
fuckeatingdisorders,fc0stty,t3_efc4ne,1577298862.0,Oh wow how triggering. I try to ignore people like that but when it‚Äôs family and you have to spend Christmas around them it‚Äôs hard.
fuckeatingdisorders,fc0sc5i,t3_efi06x,1577298502.0,Me too. Plus I‚Äôm always terrified my little nieces are going to pick up on my behaviors and that is the last thing I need.
fatlogic,fbzgwku,t1_fbzf55j,1577246293.0,Personal experience. I was fat shamed by my grandma and all it did was make me angry at her for being such a bitch. Saying someone looks like a water heater isn‚Äôt a nice honest way of telling them the truth. I did lose weight but only when I had a doctor tell me that my PCOS was probably going to be lessened if I lost some weight. Big difference.
