I'll do you one more solid though, regarding trump's spiritual advisor, the one calling for ""miscarriages of ""satanic pregnancies"", the one who says: ‘To say ‘no’ to President Trump would be saying ‘no’ to God, and I won’t do that’. Another disturbing one, one that shows her greed off quite well is this: 

>**""I want you to hear from God. God already spoke to me what I'm going to write out. You're going to write your checks to Paula White Ministries,"" White preached. ""If God tells you to give $12.99, do it. Whatever the Holy Spirit speaks to you. If you need to give by credit card, do so.""
White regularly urges those in her pews to donate to her ministry, promising that God will bless them with wealth and ""visions"" in return. She sometimes warns her followers that *their ""dream will die"" if they don't.*""**

I hope you read some of these.

I'd count the 13 year old girl he raped as pedophilia as well. 25 women have come forward.

Seriously, this is the president of the United States. Name calling, just like the super insecure bullies that don't think they're worth a shit, so they try to drag others down to their level. 

Absolutely pathetic. 

Even more pathetic? The brainless sheep who cheer for it. How sad must their lives be to have decided that trump, of alllll the people in the world, is who they want to hitch their wagon to? He treats his followers like they are the dumbest people in America. He got that right, at least. He literally lies to them a dozen or more times a day, constantly gaslighting them, and yet... they cheer. Rick Sanchez said it best; ""Your boos mean nothing; I've seen what makes you cheer"". It speaks volumes to the character of these MAGAts that they'd support a monster like trump. Pitiful. It's sad and it's sick. I'm glad they wear those ugly red hats, so the good and sane people of the world know to steer clear of those bottom feeders."
