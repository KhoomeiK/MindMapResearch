todayilearned,ffe9k4q,t3_et3iro,1579840461.0,"You may find trying to hold a burger in the suggested way is painful.  That's because it requires putting your ringfinger and your pinkie into drastically different positions, one above and one below the burger, and the tendons, muscles, and nerves that control them aren't very good at holding them in opposing positions (there's some vestigial shared infrastructure between those two fingers, dating back to when our ancestor species didn't have as many fingers as we do and those were just one finger).  If you have this problem, try changing the suggested grip to just 2 fingers above, not 3, by having your ringfinger on the bottom, next to the pinkie, so they don't have to be doing contradictory things from each other.

An example of this shared infrastructure between pinkie and ringfinger:  Try to curl your index finger down to your palm while holding the other 3 fingers straight.  Pretty easy.  Now try with the middle finger.  Pretty easy.  Now the ring finger.  A bit harder but still doable.  Now try with the pinkie.  Feel how you can't help but curl the ringfinger along with it when you curl the pinkie?  That's from the vestigial way the tendons and muscles are hooked up, with the same muscle being attached to tendons in both the pinkie and ringfinger."

This is what was so wrong about the ""travel ban from Muslim countries"".

books,ff5msyw,t3_ercxjc,1579600734.0,"It's hard for me to judge whether my waning enjoyment was due to the series getting worse, or due to me learning more as I got older, given that I only read the series slowly one or two books a year, as their availability at my local public library was sporadic and I was trying not to read them out of order.

But I definitely remember that in the first book, as a child, I vaguely noticed a bit of Christian phrasing here and there but it wasn't that important so I just kind of ignored it and enjoyed the story.  (i.e. the frequent use of the phrase ""Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve"" when what it really meant was just ""people from Earth instead of from Narnia"".  It was a very very \*weird\* way to say that, but I could mostly ignore that weirdness and move on.)

But by The Last Battle, several books later, and a few years more schooled, thus aware of several world religions I was not a member of (one of which was Christianity), I was more than just not enjoying it anymore.  I was actively frustrated and mad at what it was claiming.  I was only continuing to read it so I could say I had completed it, not wanting to give up after getting this far along in the series.  A lot of the books made some analogies between Astlan-followers and Christianity, but The Last Battle \*really\* poured it on thick with an End-Times kind of story, that portrays unbelievers as the bad guys.  As someone well on my way to becoming an unbeliever myself at the time, I found that message deeply disturbing.  Not because I thought it was true, but because it disturbed me that this viewpoint was being \*taught\* by a children's book.

But the books \*before\* The Last Battle aren't so bad.  They have Christian allegory, but it's mild and not really going to offend anyone.  The Last Battle, on the other hand, is on a whole different level.  It doesn't mask a thing, and it goes on the offensive."

todayilearned,ff5kry1,t1_ff5ebcj,1579597634.0,"The title of this reddit post was \*written\* badly.  The problem probably wasn't reading comprehension.  It was failing to read further into the article itself. From just the title alone, it gives the opposite meaning to what the article said.  When shifting to 8:30 means you are shifting further forward on the timeline (i.e. later), then shifting to 8:30 isn't a shift backward in time.  It's a shift forward in time.  But the title \*said\* it was a ""shift back to"" 8:30.

Only after reading further into the article and seeing that it contradicted the title was I able to read the title again a few times and see a possible second ambiguous meaning, that maybe ""shift back to"" meant ""return it to the way it had previously been"" rather than ""back"" being the \*direction\* of the shift.  From the title alone, with no further context (and not having a kid of high school age to know the high school schedules myself), it definitely looks like the title means the current time is later than 8:30 and 8:30 is a shift back in time to an earlier time of day."

When you do that, they will come back together again on the opposite side of the earth.

Hypothetically if you did that starting above longitude 0 on Earth when you start drifting way, at longitude 90 you will be the farthest away, then start coming back and meet the shuttle again at longitude 180, then if you miss it and go past, you'll go the other way and be farthest away at longitude 270, then meet again at longitude 0.

Kos,feocwfj,t3_epvenq,1579298353.0,"It may be quite hard to force C into kRISC.  One reason being that kRISC is implemented on top of C#, and is often just a wrapper around .Net Classes.  (i.e. list manipulation is just calling .Net's LIST<> type, and string manipulation is just calling .Net's String type, etc.)

One effect this has is that managed memory with orphaning to ""get rid of"" memory is the pattern kRISC assumes the higher level language on top of it (kerboscript) has.  C's direct pointer manipulation would be pretty hard to implement on top of that.

There's a reason kRISC ended up that way.  It's because kOS, and kerboscript actually came first, with kRISC coming \*later\*, being shoved 'underneath' kerbscript to change how it was implemented.

In the original implementation of kOS by Kevin Nivekk, there was no compiler, and the ""language"" was not really parsed with a proper grammar one could express with BNF or anything like that.  Instead the ""language"" was more like a macro system where it would read one line of text, play with regexes to figure what pattern it fit into, and then execute that line of text, then end the current FixedUpdate.  It was one line of script text per FixedUpdate, read on the fly as it goes.  That meant executing was very slow, even slower than one would expect for a script language because of that ""one line of text per FixedUpdate"" pattern, and the cost of interpreting was paid again and again each iteration of a loop.  Also the language had weird inconsistencies like the order of operations being different for some commands than for others, and some commands accepting math expressions while other ones only accepted single variable identifiers.  This all came from each command being a macro with its own regex rule, and they weren't all written quite the same.

Then a dev, Mariano Appendino, forked kOS to make kRISC, designed to insert a proper parser step in there, and compile down into something a bit more fine-grain so it can split up FixedUpdates into finer-grain chunks, and thus the IPU concept was born.  Erendrake had sort of unofficially taken over kOS at that point and he and I and a few others had started to add new features that weren't there yet in Mariano's original fork.   Erendrake worked with  Mariano to merge their codebases back together rather than fork a different project for kRISC that would run faster but be missing the newer features, and that's when kOS got kRISC under it, and a proper compiler.  This all happened at about the time I had joined the project, and now I'm the one sort of managing it with many others having moved on.

So yeah, kRISC was deliberately invented with the goal of supporting kerboscript in mind, rather than with the goal of being a very generic machine.

I had toyed with the idea of a simple assembler for kRISC so people could drop down to writing directly in that instead of kerboscript, or even embed that inside kerboscript with a compiler directive.  But I backed down from that idea when I realized it would mean having to turn kRISC into a ""public promise"", i.e. an API we plan to keep unchanged so people's assembly code wouldn't break in future updates.  Contrast that with how at the moment, kRISC is free to be altered at will as needed to support new things in kerbscript, because nobody writes in kRISC directly.  All we have to do is issue a warning with the update that says ""recompile your KSM files after this update because kRISC changed a bit.""

I find what you did impressive.  But you are correct about the ""wall"" you hit with kRISC looking like it was designed to only support kerboscript, because that's sort of how it came to be in the first place.  It would be neat to make it support more, but that would probably take some large overhauls."

It \*cannot\* be given a proper scientific definition without first being willing to redefine which things we call continents.  It's the same as the ""pluto planet"" problem.  You can't find a scientific definition that gives us only 9 planets.  If Pluto is included, then so are lots of other bodies.  If you don't want to include those other bodies, then any definition that excludes them excludes Pluto too.  It's not possible to pick an objective, hard definition that still will keep the same bodies ""planets"" as we had before.  The only way to make a more hard definition is to change which things historically got called planets.  As long as we want to keep the same 9 things as planets, no more no less, no good definition does that and the word would have to remain subjective fuzzy nonsense."
gaming,fdh01km,t1_fdeqkzf,1578412413.0,"I'm a programmer.  I'm aware of this.  It's just wrong.  Hint, the word ""programmer"" doesn't just refer to the programmer using an API like ""DisplayMessage(""string"");""  It also applies to the person who WROTE that API.  And what I'm saying is that ""Ok"" for a single-button message box is a terrible default for the API to use because it's not as generic as other choices would have been.  It's wrong because the word ""Dismiss"" or ""Close"" or ""Acknowledge"" is correct 100% of the time for a one-button dialog.  There is no choice, so don't use ""Ok"" like the user is giving consent.  All they have the power to do in a one-button dialog is to let you know ""message received, you can close the box now"".  ""Ok"" is only correct a portion of the time.  So if you have one generic thing every one-button box uses, it makes more sense to make that be the thing that works in 100% of the cases you're going to use it.  If there's two buttons, call them Ok and Cancel.  If there's only one button, call it Acknowledge.  That generic system would always sound correct, rather than just sound correct a portion of the time.

I've always found it annoying ever since it first started appearing, before it ended up becoming a standard (sadly).  I think the real reason is far far lazier than your explanation.  I think the real reason is that for the ""ok/cancel"" dialogs they already had built an ""ok button"" and a ""cancel button"" routine, and so the for the one-button dialogs they wanted to re-use one of them rather than make a third one with a new word."

Save the word ""Ok"" for dialog boxes where there's a choice between ""Ok"" and ""Cancel"" and thus you are actually asking for consent.
