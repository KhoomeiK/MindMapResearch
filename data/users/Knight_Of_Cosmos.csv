aww,fgfv2d0,t3_ey5y55,1580748245.0,"I do this with my golden all the time. I ask him if he ""wants to fight"" and we do exactly this, snarls and everything. Sometimes I'll snarl back and it makes him more excited. I always know he is playing around cause he sneezes, which dogs do when they play as a way to say ""jk man we ain't killing each other for real"". Whenever I say ""ok mean time over"" he stops and goes back to doing whatever he was doing. 

Even when he does chomp my arm, it doesn't hurt because he knows bite inhibition and has a soft mouth generally anyways lol"

Not gunna lie... Doing something like that? He deserves this."

I'm sending him a little fan mail today! There's even a little surprise in it, I sketched a picture of him playing the guitar. I really wanna know how he reacts, I'm so excited!!"
ptsd,fg5bowy,t3_ewrmr3,1580523275.0,"hey! I have a service dog, and part of his job is helping me with my PTSD. It sounds like what you are describing is more of a psychiatric service dog! 

An ESA would not be able to go anywhere with you, nor are they required to be trained. In fact, their presence is for making you feel better. That's about it. A psychiatric service dog however is task trained to help you with these things, such as panic. They would be with you, but you would have to train them to be able to cope in public. 

I can give more information or answer questions about this if this is the route you'd want to take!"
Assistance,fg4yo25,t3_ewo24a,1580514084.0,Posted on my personal Facebook and in my college's classifieds group. Will try and send some mail as well!! :) Your father is an absolute blessing. Made me tear up a couple times from how wholesome he is!!!
BanPitBulls,fg296by,t1_fg1xywb,1580440751.0,So glad I am getting my conceal carry soon.
BanPitBulls,fg2933u,t3_ewdmmq,1580440711.0,"Oh my god I wanna throw up, I cannot handle that poor dog crying for help. That hurts my heart so much. I hope it is alive :("
BanPitBulls,fg19c39,t3_ew0yfr,1580423128.0,"""after training almost a month to get Lucia certified"" 

there is no certification or registration

also only a month??? really??? that's almost the dumbest thing I've read all week. It takes more like two years for service dog training."
dogswithjobs,ffzqdq3,t1_ffzcypu,1580389807.0,"I answered in depth on here somewhere, but he is an all around multipurpose service dog! He does psych, medical alert, and mobility tasks (not too many as his bones are still growin')!"
dogswithjobs,ffzq79e,t1_ffzcta6,1580389644.0,"In terms of heart rate, they can smell it usually! When your heart rate increases a lot you produce more of the hormone cortisol (and adrenaline sometimes), which dogs can smell. You know how people say dogs know when you're scared? They can smell it! 

As for migraines I'm actually not quite sure what he's picking up! I've been told by his trainer it's a very discreet scent change, but I don't know a lot about what is produced when you get a migraine! 

He is a golden retriever though, yep! The fluffiest boy around!"
dogswithjobs,ffyx73c,t1_ffyvor8,1580357417.0,"This is a good question! Thank you for asking! I, personally, don't mind when folks say it in passing to like, a friend or parent or someone like that. Especially kids. It would definitely be different if you loudly exclaimed it (which is rude and obnoxious) as opposed to say, telling a friend in a normal tone of voice ""hey a cute working dog!"" 

I guess it really depends on what you say or do too? For example, some people gasp or squeal when they see him and that usually gets a lot of people's attention. That's definitely rude imo and feels really awkward. 

I suppose the best answer is to just not make a huge deal about seeing a service dog. A lot of people really overreact and act like they've never seen a dog in their entire life, but treating the handler like it's no big deal makes a world of difference. 

I hope that kind of answered the question! It was a really great question to ask! :)"
dogswithjobs,ffyuw31,t1_ffyt867,1580355743.0,"Oh most definitely! Every day after class he gets to do his zoomies and we let everyone love on him. Sometimes I'll take him to the lake on campus so he can watch the ducks and swim. 

Definitely spoiled rotten!"
