I wouldn't let this guy cause you to give up on offering a service that other Spanish speakers might be really grateful to have.  

I understand that you want to be culturally sensitive, and that's the reason you are even bothering to learn Spanish, which is really awesome, by the way!    I usually have good experiences when I speak Spanish to people.  One possibility is that the guy has experienced a lot of racism, and therefore didn't know how to properly interpret your help.  The reason I asked about your state is because I have found in western states, I almost always get great reception and enthusiasm for any attempt to speak Spanish.  Whereas in southern states it has more potential to be taken as an insult or seen as a way to insinuate that the person can't speak English.  If that is the case, one way to lessen the onus of it, might be to mention that you are learning Spanish and so it is useful for you to have the practice.  

That said it sounds like it wasn't just that he was uncomfortable,  but that he was the one being unkind and insensitive.   I don't think you caused it.  You offered him a service, and you offered it kindly."

offmychest,fedzf6m,t3_eofjg7,1579023119.0,"It sounds like you liked your work and feel like you will kind of miss it, apart from the one manager, is that right?

I think you did great in bringing this to another manager, and dealing with a hostile work environment. And the good news is you have this under your belt as experience. You now have the experience of protecting yourself, and asking for what you need. Some people never learn to do that. You also have the experience that you had some personal power given back to you by the manager who was willing to make changes. This experience is invaluable, because you have learned your value as an employee, and now you know that the terms of employment are always negotiable.

If the work isn't the best thing for you, you shouldn't feel guilty about leaving it. If your life is a ship, you are the captain and are responsible for always doing what is best for the ship and the crew (meaning yourself), once they are taken care of, then you can help others. Sure you should help others when you can, but not when it is to the detriment of the ship, because your primary responsibilities are to yourself, not to how people outside feel as a result of what you do.  I am not saying don't consider them at all, you did the right thing by giving two weeks notice, that considered them. But you have to put what you want to do with your life before what is convenient for others. You should not feel guilty about that, it is a healthy thing to do.

It is very important to take care of yourself. Like on an airplane they tell you to always put your own oxygen mask on first, before helping others-- that is true for helping others as well. You have to take care of you, get the rest you need, eat well, take time to feel centered. Only then can you really have your true self to give. That is a good reason to quit your job, or lower your hours.

If you are actually still want to work there, but for less hours a week, and they can arrange for you never to have to work with the bad supervisor, then perhaps you might want to just re-negotiate your hours. It's okay to go back and say I've thought about your offer, and if you could make 'x' happen, I'd like to stay.

If you just don't want to disappoint them, then try to take a step back and look at yourself as if you were a friend. What advice would you give a friend who told you about what was happening? How would you talk to a friend who was going through this? You would probably tell her to worry about herself first, right? Because you care about your friend, right?

Best of luck to you.  It sounds like you are doing a pretty dang good job in the choices you are making!"

Spanish,feczomb,t3_eoew9o,1578991421.0,"I think a common mistake we make as foreigners is to say things exactly as we would say them in English.  I think that the best thing a person can do is learn the reflexive really well, because it is one of the very most used ways of speaking, and it is sometimes under-emphasized in Spanish classes, or not taught at all.  It isn't a way that we speak in English, so translating directly word for word we end up saying things in a more cumbersome way.  IN doing so, we end up having to use a lot of extra pors and paras that the reflexive eliminates the need for.  

A second common mistake, while technically correct, would be the use of estoy + geriundo, which native speakers tend to use more for interrupted action, or to emphasize that they are in the middle of something.  So a native speaker being asked in a store ""Can I help you find something?"" ""is more likely to respond with ""Busco almendras,"" where as an English speaker will almost always say ""Estoy buscando almendras."""

The other event in the past is either specifically stated, or implied.  So for example, if you are already talking about your childhood, then the qualifier ""when I was a child"" is implied and doesn't need to be re-stated.

offmychest,fe4hyh0,t3_enknog,1578859525.0,"Great that you will report this to the police! This is extreme behavior and you could save lives with your report-- either your own, or the lives of others, by raising this guys profile on police suspects lists. Surely, this is not this guy's first time. This is kidnapping behavior. I suggest doing it as soon as possible, while video surveillance both in-store and of the parking lot is still available. As an additional precaution against accidental deletion, l suggest a written request to Target that they save in-store and parking lot tapes for the time period as well as earlier and later in the day. Who knows what the police could learn.

I think you have a great head on your shoulders. I suggest avoiding going anywhere alone for a while. In case this guy saw your license plate as you left, or in case he has been tracking you for a while and this was his first approach.

If you carry mace, I suggest you do a practice spray, so you know how it comes out, of the cannister.  Some streams from different manufacturers come out differently, I am talking about how the product itself sprays, not how you press the trigger.  Having done a practice spray will greatly improve aim if ever you ever actually need to use it.

I used to carry pepper spray when I went out. My dad gave me this advice, when he gave me my first can of pepper spray: ""Daughter,"" he said, ""this spray will only be of use to you if you can get to it to use it, so 1.) never let anyone know you have it, no matter how much you trust them \[even guys you think you really know, you you could end up needing to use it on\]. And, it is that much harder to get to, if someone knows you have it 2.) Don't let your girlfriends know you have it because they might trust someone and mention it 3.) keep it someplace you can get it fast""

I followed that advice to the letter. Even when talking to a guy who advised me to carry spray, I'd still say, ""yeah, that's a great idea, I should do that.""

This is how I kept my spray on me: the spray had a safety lock and spray button at one end, and a little ring at the other end. I took a luggage tie from an airport tag-- those little white elastic bands that come off with a hard yank-- I connected the end ring to a safety pin via the luggage tag elastic, and I safety pinned it under my skirt or shirt on the side of my dominant hand, so that it was about 2-3 inches up from the hem. If I needed it, with one hard yank it would be in my hand and ready to go.

So once you are as safe as you can be--try to put this out of your mind. Have your plan, but then let it go. See yourself as safe.

I am careful to drop the pasta through the oil spot on the top of the water, and stir as it goes in. I stir once or twice more, about 2 minutes (essential) and 4 minutes in.   I also rinse my pasta very lightly and very fast in cold water as soon as it has been drained.  Just a small rinse takes care of sticking and isn't enough to cool down the pasta.  I use cold running water and see that the stream of water goes over all parts of the colander,  probably 2-3 seconds in total.

I know that lots of cooking shows claim the world will fall apart if you rinse pasta, but I find rinsing it this way doesn't take off all the starch, and the sauce still clings nicely.  Yes, you can over-rinse pasta and it will be watery and not stick well. However, that doesn't really happen with a quick rinse.  I think un-rinsed pasta tastes gross.  I have tried to like it--- especially after seeing a rave from someone like Scott Conditt who says that rinsing ruins pasta, then I have tried it again un-rinsed several times,   just trying to see what I am missing. Each time, I am reminded, nope, completely un-rinsed pasta just tastes gross to me.  I Even tried it after huge amount of water cooking-- I decided not to rinse.  IT was still gross, and that is the last time I tried it because it ruined a beautiful bowl of pasta and sauce.  Is anyone else out there like me?

PressureCooking,fdb1ly6,t3_ccpz7p,1578252666.0,"I bought the Yedi and it is great. I am imagine they likely have UK version. The reason I chose it over the instant pot was because it gives a two year guarantee over the one year for Instant Pot, it cost less than the IP, and it came with accessories, and it has a stainless seal inner pot, which was important to me. It turns out they have great old-fashioned style customer service.  

Which brings me to another point-- if you are bringing the pot you buy with you to Hong Kong, I suggest as soon as you buy it you do a couple tests. I say this because I live abroad, and It is not infrequent for new items to have glitches, right out of the box, and you want to find this out before you transport it to Hong Kong. Identifying glitches ahead of time is essential. I suggest you not only test the pressure cooking function (with the cup of water like the instructions for these types of pots suggest before first use), but that you also test other functions like ""slow cook"" etc. (but with more water, obviously). 

I ordered my first Yedi and it was fantastic. I ordered a second because I needed two! The second had a factory glitch. The build of the product seems pretty solid, and there can be a few products that fail in any brand. When my second pot came I tested the pressure cooking function with water as recommended in the instructions. Then I boxed it back up until I was ready to start using it. A month or two went by, then I got it out to use for the first time. This cooker did not slow cook properly. The slow cooker function would pressurize. I contacted customer service and they gave me a refund. It was so painless and they were really helpful.

My point is though, whichever pot you buy, if you are taking it to Hong Kong yourself first use water to test it on the several functions, or at least those you think will be most important to your friend."
instantpot,fdaukb3,t3_ek03uy,1578250368.0,"In my opinion a lot of the things like ""manufacture says absolutely not"" are purely based on living in an extremely litigious society. One can can in any pressure cooker that is able to maintain the pressure needed, and has adequate head space above the jars.

These multipot cookers are usually pretty short, so one needs a minimum of a 6 quart, and this requires using short jars-- like nothing taller than a pint. Basically it needs to fit on a trivet in the pot or canning type disk, with water covering to just below the sealing band. The water would need to be below the max fill line for pressure, and the rims would need to be below the regular max fill line.

It's important to have a short trivet, or disk, or basket so that the cans do not come into direct contact with the bottom of the pot. Otherwise air-bubbles from boiling get between and pot bottom and jars and can cause breakage or weakness in the jars when they hit the bottom of the pot.

One comment says that the instant pot only gets to 11.6 PSI and therefore isn't safe to can in. Hmmm. Among my several canning books they all call for 10 PSI, so sounds perfect to me! In fact, most my books state, canning at 15 PSI is not recommended because at the time they were written the FDA had not yet completed studies on that. Canning at 10 PSI has longer canning times than canning at 15 PSI, and as far as I know 10 PSI is still pretty much the standard.

I haven't canned in my pot yet, however, that is because I did not know what PSI it reaches. The other night I had to can just three small pints and I had to drag out the big ol' pressure canner-- the pot would have been perfect!!  A quick internet search tells me that PSI varies with pot model as well with as manufacturer. I suspect those must be PSI at high pressure. I will be researching mine, which is a Yedi, and if it reaches 11.6, I will be using it to can small pint jars!!!! 

To me, the idea that the FDA would be needed to see if canning in one brand of pressure cooker over another still works, is ridiculous. As long as the pressure is over 10 PSI and you are using timing for 10 PSI, it will work the same as any other PC that goes to 10 PSI. How silly! In fact I think that the manufactures statement ""Absolutely not because it only goes to 11.6,"" is rather a ""Yes, it gets hotter than what you need, but we are going to cover ourselves and say no against you damaging the machine."" Which BTW due to the shortness of the pots, there is the risk that if the customer might put jars in the pot that were tall enough to rise above the max fill line, which then might interfere with closing of the pot, potential damage to the pot and/or lack of proper seal, etc.

My canning books all say 10 PSI for canning things like low acid items such as meat etc.. I personally, will not be shy about using my pot as a 10 PSI canner.

One poster mentions trouble with Jam, which really only needs a boiling water bath and could likely be done using the sauté function. While it isn't stated what the jam malfunction was, I suspect it was boil-over. Boil over could happen due to user-error with any pressure cooker. Pressure canning requires a bit of study to learn things like how not to get boil over (one doesn't release the pressure too fast, and then lets cans sit in the water for 10 mins after pressure is released). 

If one has never pressure canned before there is definitely a learning curve and one should read up on it before starting. A site that I think is particularly good to get you started, and that has a great article on flat-sour to boot is this one:

I am glad I saw this thread, it has inspired me to see if I can turn my pot into a mini-canner!!"
Frugal,fd7ow7s,t1_fd7nycs,1578207804.0,"I should also mention a cat eating meat eats less than what they eat in regular pet-food because there are no corn and grain fillers which make them eat more. And since they are carnivores their elimination system is a lot more efficient when eating meat.  They poop less, it is smaller, and it does not stink like it did on cat-food. They poop less because they are better able to utilize the nutrition in the food."

Chicken, for example, cats can eat wing bones and smaller.  I take the leg thigh and breast meat off the bone and cut it into big strips.  I leave small parts like ribs and cartilage attached.  I separate it into one meal- worth portion, and freeze.  Then I de-thaw rapidly (just that meal's worth) in a bowl of water till the meat is room temperature as cats aren't supposed to eat cold. They are also supposed to have a bit of fat and skin-- so I leave that on when I cut it up into strips."
Frugal,fd6wb6h,t3_ej98mn,1578196540.0,"People have suggesting talking to her about her long term goals, and using that as a jumping board for getting her to understand what decisions she would have to make financially in order to achieve those goals.  And also what choices you would have to make to achieve yours.  It seems that finances might not be a real concrete thing to her.  If you do talk about those goals, both hers and yours, you should run numbers and show her actual break downs.  In terms of day to day, month to month, year to year, what would be required based on your current salaries to meet those goals, listing all your expenses including what you alot for entertainment and dining out.  Also talk to her about the emotional stress of being over extended.  

When you live with your parents there is no doubt about having a roof over your head.  It is just a given that it will be there.  However, as you know, when you are supporting yourself, then there is always that risk of becoming homeless if you over extend.  Heck, even if you plan, an unexpected medical issue, can land you in difficulties.  Who wants to plan for life in a way that could leave yourself in such a situation? WHile she sees you not giving her what she wants, she may not realize the stress involved in over-spending due to risk of homelessness. 

Even is she agreed to be your safety net against homelessness, you would then 1.) become dependent on the relationship working out leading to lower authenticity between you, and 2.) become non-equals in your relationship.  Anytime one person becomes dependent on another the dependent person has a lesser amount of power in the relationship-- no longer equal.

Frugal,fd6pnf6,t3_ejl3nf,1578194193.0,"Okay, I realize that this will likely be unpopular-- but here's what I suggest -- my vets have strongly recommended grain-free food and raw food. First time we did raw we were grinding it up and mixing it and making recipies. We did it for a few years, then we eventually gave it up due to it being so much work.

Then our cats got some health problems caused mostly by poor oral health. Our new vet (new due to our relocation) also suggested we feed raw as a solution to our cat's severe tartar problem. We winced and told him the grinding was too much work, and he said, ""What do you mean grinding? No, No. It should be given whole. They need the chewing action to clean the tartar off their teeth.""

Since the cat who needed dental cleaning the most could not be put under anesthesia, and therefor could not have his teeth cleaned by any other means, we decided to follow the advice. He had some teeth that were entirely covered in hard yellow tartar. We were told that poor oral health is the gateway to disease in cats. According to the vet's recommendations we started giving them something like 75% whole meat pieces (think chicken wings, or strips of meat, NO pork), 15% organ meats, and 5% veggies. Raw meat has to be super fresh.

Amazingly in about three months there was no tartar. I couldn't believe it!! Whats more all my cats got a new lease on life. They got more energy and became more active, and I forgot they were old farts. They are 14 and had begun to start showing their age. Now I think they might make it to 20."

I would not have initially interpreted it the way I mentioned in my post.  Rather, that is from my experience when I have attended schools that say that.  So far, 100% of the time they have had teachers who did no planning, and the ""lessons"" were a real waste of time.  

There are good schools who do planning, but in my experience they are few and far between, and so worth it when they can be found.

LifeProTips,fd5wxin,t1_fcwu2pd,1578182532.0,"Theoretically you could also celebrate New Years Day week earlier or later too. For some people moving the date of Valentines Day will be good, for others not, they have a vision -- just like someone else's New Years Eve vision. For example, I have a friend, who if she can't see the count-down happening on TV, New Years Eve feels ruined to her, like she missed it. My friend was at a New Years Eve Party but the party didn't show the TV count down, so she kinda felt like she missed New Years.  That count down, or even being up for New Years, isn't important to me.  So my point regarding Valentines Day being on the exact day, the fact that to some people that is important, I don't think that it necessarily means the person is shallow, nor the relationship doomed."

I don't think there is anything wrong with Valentines Day being important to someone.  I don't think it is a reflection on the quality of the relationship. What I do think is important, is that the couple talks about it, and if it is important to one of the couple, then celebrate it.

Spanish,fcw99dw,t3_ej5uji,1578020078.0,"I think that it is a good idea, and I think it depends on who your audience is. I think that the type of Spanish student who specifically wants a lower cost, over a tourist area, tend to be learners who already know a bit of Spanish, and are therefore comfortable with the greater degree of immersion. Those type of learners, as well as expats already living in said non-tourist area, might make up a significant proportion of your probable audience.

I think those types of students in particular, are likely to want a school that offers instruction at advanced levels. Obviously expats in tourist areas tend to have a low level of Spanish. But the level goes up rather quickly for those living in non-touristed non-expat areas.

Frankly it is very difficult to find schools that offer advanced instruction, or that do it well. While many schools say they offer advanced classes, advertising that they ""tailor classes to meet the needs of the individual student,"" so often, it really means is ""we don't bother making lesson plans, and we are going to pretend that this is an asset to the student-- someone with almost no teaching qualification or skill will just talk off the top of their head, and we call that 'tailored to the student'.""

As an expat who has lived in Latin America for many years, in both touristed and non-touristed areas I have attended a number of Spanish schools as well as hired private tutors.  I find schools (or tutors) who offer this lack of lesson planning for their advanced classes worthless. Most students who are at an advanced level have friendships that consist of native Spanish speakers. So, the on-the-fly conversational method is something we can easily get for free with language exchange partners.

Advanced classes are really hard to find. And good advanced classes are even harder to find. So my suggestion, if you do start the school, is one way to set yourself apart would be to offer really good high-level classes. While they may be less in demand overall, they could really drive the lower end market to you as well, because people who want to learn will always ask those they consider to be advanced non-native speakers where to learn and how to learn.

If you were do do this aspect well, and market yourself correctly, it could potentially make your school a destination learning institution and a big name in the business in relatively short order comparatively speaking."

Frugal,fcagnvv,t3_djo2w6,1577568907.0,"For me rice with frozen peas is really satisfying. I think, like beans, it completes proteins. Added bonus, you don't need a second pot. Just add the peas on top of the rice for the last few minutes of cooking.

Another thing that spices up rice is tuna sauce over rice, which we used to eat when we were kids, back when tuna was an uber cheap to buy item. I don't know how much tuna costs these days, but tuna or canned meat like chicken, or whatever you might have access to (from a food bank) can go into the same sauce. Basically you make a roux and then add milk, salt and pepper, and then the tuna, with juice to taste.  

I will give recipies details incase they might be useful to you. So the ratio is 2-3 Tablespoons flour per cup of milk depending on how thick you like your sauces. I tend to go with the 3T per cup of liquid, because I like a thicker sauce. SO basically to make a roux you mix a fat or oil and flour, cook it for a bit (over medium heat), then slowly add cold liquid. stirring in what cold liquid you add little by little before adding more to avoid lumps. Then you add your cooked meat, and season it with salt and pepper then add any other spices you like or that go with the particular meat you've used. Some idea for spices: celery salt or poultry seasoning, or a dash of hot-sauce, really any spices you like depending on your tastes. A little hunk of strong-tasting cheese instead of meat with a little seasoning salt, will give you cheese sauce.  

The best tip I will give you in making a palatable sauce, is to properly cook the flour. Yes liquid should be cold, and roux hot. Generally people use equal parts fat and flour, but you can do 1 1/2T fat per 2T flour if you want, and it will still work. The important thing for a good sauce, is one many people skip, which is cooking the roux for atleat 2-3 minutes (stirring constantly) before adding milk. This cooks the flour, (raw flour doesn’t taste good), and builds flavor. The longer you cook the flour, before addding milk the richer the flavor that is imparted to the sauce. 

You can also just use this base as a white sauce, maybe add a good amount of garlic, (add garlic towards end of roux cooking and before milk), and eat it over pasta.  

So Tuna sauce (2 cups) would be: 3T fat, 4t white flour, 2 cup milk, 1 can tuna, salt, pepper

Meat and gravy (2 cups) might: be 3T fat, 2 T white flour, 3/4cup juice from meat, 1 ¼ cup milk, salt, pepper, celery salt, poultry seasoning

Pasta sauce (1 cup) might be: 2T fat, 2T flour, minced garlic. 2 cups milk, salt, pepper, thyme, mixed veggies.

A lot of people suggest dry beans, and that is a good idea, however, if you have an electric stove in an area with high utuility rates, It might not turn out to be very economical. This is the don’t drive and spend $2 in gas in order to save  .50 cents principle. If you don’t normally cook beans, a useful tip: to shorten cooking times and turn out good beans is to never salt beans untill fully cooked. Salting before hand toughens the husks and increases cooking time by hours. Also you can soak over night first, or if you are short on time, you can cheat-soak by bringing to a boil on the stove for a full minute at a rolling boil, then letting cool for an hour before starting cooking. A way to see if beans are fully soaked is to cut one open shortwise. A fuly soaked bean will show uniform color inside. If not there will be a core that you can see hasn’t yet abosrbed the water fully. Also be sure to add all the water at the beginning usually 6 water to 1 beans. If you need to add water during cooking make it boiling water. Cold water shuts down the cooking processs of the beans it hits first, and causes uneven bean cookage."

If turning off the breaker in your house actually turned off their lights that would mean it is downstream of the meter and costing you money.  You said the second time it did not turn off their lights.  I have lived in countries where power theft is more common than it is in the US.  People who steal power in those countries generally have the stolen power going only to part of their house, and still use their own electricity in most of their house.  They, for example will run the stolen power line to run cost heavy things like a washer and dryer, while other circuits are run off their own power.  If that were the case, it could explain why their lights went out the first time, but not the second.  It would also indicate they realized you did the test.  You should locate your electric meter near the street that measures the power that goes into your house.  Once you see the meter visually follow the wires.  From the meter there will be a wire bundle that goes back to the street, and a wire bundle that goes to your house.  If the ""janky"" connection is between the power meter and your house, you have a problem and I suggest you photograph it and go down to the power company."

Like half the price the printer, for one small cartridge.  I have an Epson L380.  It's out of date, but if you google it you will see that it has ink reservoirs that are filled with replacement bottles of ink for $5 that have five times the ink of a $45 cartridge.  I am sure you can find a current model that is similar.  If buying a printer, in addition to pricing ink cartridges or refills, also check to see that it includes the cables you need to hook it up, as some come without the cable and you have to buy a sometimes expensive cable after your printer purchase

If you plan to do cooking I suggest a Yedi Pot.  Similar to a InstantPot, but less expensive, has a better guarantee, and includes many extra accessories that you have to buy separately with InstantPot.  So these pots can serve as slow cookers (meals cook while you are in class), or pressure cookers (last minute meals in no time).  They make fantastic boiled eggs.   They have a saute function to be used like a regular cooking pan, and quite a few other features.  some people actually bake in them.
