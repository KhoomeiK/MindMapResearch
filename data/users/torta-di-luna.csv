AskReddit,fghm2bo,t3_ey9qbh,1580787914.0,"Uncut fucking Gems. The opening scene with the African miners caught my attention, but after that I hated it before the first half hour was over. It mostly consisted of a bunch of men literally just yelling over each other for minutes on end (which was extremely unpleasant and jarring), Adam Sandler being a creepy old skeez, Adam Sandler being a fucking idiot, Adam Sandler saying some form of “fuck” every third word, and Adam Sandler with his airheaded girlfriend who is probably only with him because he’s in the gem business. I was relieved when he got shot in the head. It was the only interesting or exciting part aside from the opening scene. Aside from all that, the plot was incredibly weak and hardly anything actually happened. In my opinion, this movie is the embodiment of a headache. 
And apparently critics loved it in part because it was “Adam Sandler’s best work,” which is probably true, but really not saying much. 
Worst movie I’ve seen in a while."

AskWomen,fdg9j94,t3_ekvi2h,1578385877.0,"My name is Billie. I’ve never really loved it, especially because I’ve sometimes gotten stupid comments like “Isn’t that a guys’ name?” (And once when I was little, some fucking Karen actually said “What’s your REAL name, sweetie?”) But anyway, I honestly get compliments more often than that stuff. Another thing that really bothers me for some reason is when people spell it “Billy,” which is a HELL of a lot. Like, Billy is short for William. Billy is a 12-year-old boy in the 1950s who plays baseball. Do you seriously think someone would give that name to a girl?? It’s an I. E. Oh, and of course nowadays, I sometimes get “Ohh, like Billie Eilish?!” Please. No."
