AskReddit,ff30qlv,t1_ff2yngd,1579530577.0,"Growing up for my friend was pretty tough. He was adopted by a blind couple that were verbally abusive and basically treated him as a slave. After elementary school I didn't see much of him. 

In my early twenties I was watching the news and there was a stand off at one of the larger intersections at the time. A ~~black S10~~ pickup sat in the middle with damn near the whole police force surrounding it. After some time had passed, the officers began to approach the truck since there was no activity within the cab. My friend sat up with a gun to his head. The standoff continued a bit further until he turned the gun on an officer. 

After the shootout they said the gun was unloaded. They did show recorded video up until shots were fired.
