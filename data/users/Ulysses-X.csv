compsci,ff3z5ve,t1_ff3vg95,1579552044.0,I've seen quite a few unis do it actually. One nutjob professor even had his students implement OOP in C for a Data Structures class
Nootropics,ff3p1ic,t1_ff34vhe,1579545780.0,"Huh, TIL, thanks for the tip. I've only ever heard it's anti inflammatory properties touted."
Nootropics,ff1vule,t1_ff1v0re,1579487335.0,"Yeah neglecting food on adderall makes it way less effective. I would give some anti oxidants / anti inflammatories like curcumin a shot. You could also tweak your diet, you have the 'gluten intolerant' crowd and lots of people swear by eliminating dairy. If you can it can also really help to get general bloodwork done."
Nootropics,ff1up7w,t1_ff1tqr9,1579486601.0,"That's the trick, when you have SIBO those prebiotics foods will actually make it worse, the critters are supposed to be in your colon but build up in the small intestine.

I had never even heard of it but I got lucky and had a decent gastroenterologist I was seeing for apocalyptic digestive problems. They put me on a two week round of xifaxin that worked wonders, I still take a couple supplements for maintenance as well. Also self treated for candida overgrowth which seems to be a real thing.

Yeah I was skeptical on the whole brain gut connection but very quickly became a true believer. Aside from neurotransmitter production the prevailing theory seems to be that too much and the wrong kinds of micro fauna in the small intestine dump all kinds of crap into your blood causing all kinds of issues. 

Sounds like you have a good diet though, do you have any gut problems? Also any brain fog?"
Nootropics,ff1tc4u,t3_er4yen,1579485723.0,I actually have had similar experiences with ritalin / adderall and found it to be tied to liver and gut functionality (and probably inflammation but I'm reluctant on the science behind it). Treating SIBO in the gut and trying to not stress out my liver temporarily made the ritalin go from not doing anything to having me bouncing off the walls. It still works better than before I improved my gut and diet.
news,ff0fo95,t1_ff0aoqy,1579468444.0,Depends on the anxiety. Generally speaking it would be good for low level anxiety but probably wouldn't have the kick for advanced anxiety disorders.
news,ff065zo,t1_fezto6p,1579465639.0,CBD has basically no psychoactive effect without THC. So for instance if you were taking it for PTSD or anxiety you would want a small amount of THC with a high amount of CBD.
