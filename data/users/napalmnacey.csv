Keep in mind you’re looking at a badly lit photo rather than the real thing. The real thing is very dimensional, the blue daylight has flattened the colours and enhanced the blues.

ETA: I have always struggled to do meditations due to my ADHD, and this is one of the only techniques that worked for me. It opened me up to other meditation techniques because it helped me get into the relaxation zone in my brain easier."

I use Matisse brand paints, but I have also used Chromacryl, Atelier, Golden, Liquitex, Jo Sonja - a lot. Universally I’ve found that you rob your highlights of luminance if you paint over darker colours, no matter what you do, because like skin, paint is multilayered. Personal preference and observation, of course."

ArtistLounge,fffmm09,t3_et8kgv,1579887219.0,"1. paint retarder. Make sure it’s the same brand as your paints or it might not work right.
2. a misting spray bottle with water in it. Spritz your canvas on hot days.
3. keep your paints moist on the palette. My palette is always a plastic tray with a very moist layer of Chux superwipes with a layer of Glad brand baking paper on top. The acrylic paints go on the baking paper.
4. work quick
5. Get a good soft blending brush and layer the paints gradually."
ArtistLounge,fffm9kp,t1_fffe2fh,1579887006.0,"I never, ever paint dark paints where my lighter colours are going to be, because any light colour layering over dark ones just look dead, I think. I hatch things out in a mid tone, then darken the shadows before blending into the lighter tones gradually, preserving as much as I can to sustain luminosity."

ArtistLounge,fffkem9,t1_fff4umf,1579885869.0,"Wet-on-wet. Formulaic, but very fun for beginners. Traditional painting abandons symbolic thinking entirely, which Bob Ross’ technique does not. He was helpful for me to relax and enjoy landscape painting, but I had to see other painters to really get a good understanding of colour, composition etc.

I heartily recommend “Your Brush With Nature” by Heiner Hertling. Excellent painter and a totally hilariously German dude too."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fffirg9,t1_fffeudk,1579884850.0,"It’s such a damned rush. My boyfriend and I used to walk around a nearby lake, and there was a leaflet detailing the bird species there. We decided to try to see every bird species on the list. There was one last one, elusive - chestnut teal. Well, one day while I was taking photos at the lake on my own, I saw some in the distance. I took photos but felt so sad, because my boyfriend wasn’t there to see them. So when I saw him later, I pretended I didn’t see it, and let him look at the photos I took that day. Well, he spotted the chestnut teals in the photo and was so excited, and I acted like I  hadn’t realised they were there. A couple of days later, we both saw them on the lake in person, together. I still never told him I fibbed about the first sighting, but I just didn’t want to miss the moment, ya know?"
