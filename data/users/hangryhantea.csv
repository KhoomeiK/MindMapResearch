AskReddit,fcp90dw,t3_eic8yl,1577854553.0,"The extra experience would be nice, but I don’t think I would. My life would be completely different. I would be stuck in some really nasty relationships, and I would be so paranoid about messing up my own future. The small chance of figuring out a career earlier/getting rich is not worth the chance of me not meeting all my friends and my husband and not getting my cat. The life I have now is way too precious to jeopardize on such a small chance. Even with all I’ve suffered, and it feels really good to say that. What an interesting thing to think about OP, thanks for posting!"
AskReddit,fcp8mfk,t3_ei9bm3,1577854157.0,"I see a lot of people in this thread talking about being single/widowed and feeling that need for touch.. I get that even with having a super loving husband who loves cuddling. I feel like society has kind of failed us by making us believe that comforting touch/cuddling can only be from a significant other. I love my husband but I get really sad when I haven’t had any sort of physical interaction like hugs/cuddling with friends. My one friend that I would always cuddle with is across the country, and the only other friend I’m comfortable with cuddling we just don’t anymore our relationship is different now. It’s really hard for me because I’m a physical person and I love really strongly, but I’m so worried about pushing other people’s boundaries that I never even come close to the line. It kinda sucks feeling like I’m closing off a part of myself from people I love, but I also want to be respectful. When I’m feeling real bad I cuddle my fave stuffed animal and try to get cuddles from my cat or husband. I just wish we could all be more open and chill with each other you know? Society/culture is weird man"

Gut reaction would be that you are TA, but looking at the situation from both points of view  changes things. Children are near and dear to everyone’s hearts, but think of this from your wife’s point of view. Without her, your daughter wouldn’t exist! Your daughter is a part of both of you, which is a beautiful thing. But saying you love your daughter more than anything insinuates that you put your child above your wife, who is half the reason the child exists and will hopefully be the reason future children of yours exist. I did premarital counseling with my husband, and one of the big things that stuck with me was being told that you SHOULDNT  say the exact thing you did to your child. A healthy family starts with a healthy marriage (or healthy parent) first as a foundation. Your wife did the right thing to remove herself from the situation when your comment upset her, because telling you how she felt in front of your daughter could have escalated to a really emotional and stressful situation. You obviously didn’t mean it in a hurtful way, but the deeper meaning to your words is truly hurtful. Sit down and have a calm conversation with her, listen to what she has to say, and respond kindly. I hope things workout for you OP"
