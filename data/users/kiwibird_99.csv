college,fet6r4f,t3_eqj4r9,1579372283.0,"I'm working with a chemical engineer in my lab right now, and she says she'd like to work in biological conservation, like cleaning up oil spills and stuff.  I'm sure you could find something that appeals to you in your field.  Being a chem. Engineer is a really great and expansive field to be in.  You're making a good decision career-worst, but you do have to be happy with what you're learning right now."
college,fet5wmv,t3_eqi2lh,1579372124.0,"I absolutely hate paying for lab books.  It's the biggest waste of money by far.  My advice is always check amazon for rentals, check for free online pdfs, get on your college Facebook and try to find a textbook swap forum, and check Ebay just to be sure."
AmItheAsshole,fdxaj9x,t3_en6jau,1578766898.0,"NTA.  Her actions could, and most likely will, have life-long consequences for that girl.  In my opinion, banning her from all parties is completely warranted but keeping her from prom is a teensy bit harsh.  If she keeps up this selfish, self-pitying attitude, then by all means keep her from prom.  However, if she begins to show genuine remorse for her actions, please allow her to go to prom."
AmItheAsshole,fdotud5,t3_emd9ip,1578612736.0,"NTA.  The only way you can be TA in White Elephant is if you take a gift from a child and you're an adult.  It happened at my family's White Elephant and my mom and I were shocked, though the little girl was travelling by plane in 2 days so I'm sure her mom was secretly grateful.  Still, the guy who stole it from her looked like a real ass."
DoesAnybodyElse,fdot94i,t3_em48ao,1578612362.0,"God, yes.  I have a hard time putting on fake emotions, and putting a fake smile on is one of the hardest to do.  I'm so not photogenic because of it.  My dad's the same."
college,fdosf1j,t3_emcq4e,1578611837.0,"Ours are huge, fat, and red.  They look nothing like squirrels I've seen everywhere else.  They're still wary of people but if you have food they may just come closer to you to eat."
JUSTNOMIL,fcj9sfv,t1_fcj86fo,1577680834.0,"I'm trying to be civil about the situation and keep up a good relationship with all parties, for all parties.  I dont want to just freak out in the middle of a family gathering over some eye rolling I caught.  But I will put the offending party aside and tell them that I saw their nasty behavior."
JUSTNOMIL,fcj0kcf,t1_fcix6zr,1577674285.0,"I could do that in a private way, but doing that in front of the rest of the family seems a bit petty.  Plus they could deny it in front of everyone"
AmItheButtface,fcj0es5,t1_fcixrps,1577674175.0,"Yeah, tbh you've got a point there"
AmItheButtface,fciaqgj,t1_fcgo8sz,1577659845.0,"That's definitely something I was worried about, telling her off and making it worse.  I thinking talking to my dad is the next step"
JUSTNOMIL,fciais0,t1_fchq5l7,1577659766.0,"Dont worry, I'm with my mom 100%.  I think my next ""step"" is to talk to my dad about it and get him to notice his mom's behavior."
AmItheButtface,fci8u30,t1_fchkppa,1577659153.0,"I agree, a bad present would be one thing.  But no, I assure you there's way more disrespectful things that she has done, most of them having occurred before I was born."
JUSTNOMIL,fcgc8wy,t1_fcg72bg,1577638534.0,"I'm still considered a kid by the family even tho I'm almost done with college, so I dont think picking her would work, but it was a good suggestion.  But you're right, maybe explaining what she wants more (even tho I did that this year) and maybe even getting the present for them using their money (they do that a lot) would ensure my mom has a good present.  Thanks!!"
AmItheButtface,fcg008w,t1_fcf8dfb,1577635241.0,"Sorry, I'm sure its confusingly written.  I'm not an English major.  I'll try and talk to my dad."
AmItheButtface,fcfzqv4,t1_fcejznz,1577635184.0,"College age.  I have talked to him recently, but my dad tends to be a neutral party.  He's not going to call out his mom and he's not going to protect my mom against passive aggressiveness unless it's against physical violence (and even that's a maybe).  But if you think it could help maybe it's worth a shot to talk to him more"
FamilyIssues,fcfyf1t,t1_fceavbw,1577634814.0,Ha!  She will never see that she is losing.  She thinks she's always winning.  I keep telling my mom it'll only end when she finally gets dementia (I can totally see the onset)
FamilyIssues,fcfxvqk,t1_fccpvhx,1577634723.0,"I think she just didn't want to just give my mom a giftcard because it doesn't look like a nice enough present.  She never gives people giftcards unless it's in a large quantity (me this year, she gave me 4 in a ""creative"" box)."
FamilyIssues,fcfwssw,t1_fcclzix,1577634443.0,Thanks!!
FamilyIssues,fcceu7x,t1_fccedwy,1577597585.0,"Yeah when she insulted him it was kind of quick, so I didn't really process it until later.  But from now on I need to be in the mindset of clocking that shit whenever possible"
FamilyIssues,fcca51e,t1_fcc828x,1577596072.0,"Yeah I definitely can.  The only issue is that the actually hide it pretty well.  My Granny insults her husband quite openly but my mom she insults in more subtle ways, so it's hard to really call her out without bringing my moms feeling into the conversation.  But this is a great suggestion, I will work on doing this.  Thanks!"
