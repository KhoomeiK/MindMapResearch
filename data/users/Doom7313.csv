darksouls,fffhh62,t3_et4x1z,1579884056.0,"Depends on the point of view.



From your point of view, there isn’t really a “bad guy”. You’re just following your destiny. Yes that means you gotta kill everyone, but still, your just fulfilling a ancient prophecy




From the normal enemies and most of the bosses, you’re a complete monster. I mean, they’re just minding their own business and you come through and kill em all."
RandomActsofCards,ffff71o,t3_et9k5c,1579882646.0,I would like #4! I’m always talking to myself!

darksouls,ffcy5vr,t1_ffcvy7k,1579809695.0,Oh I’ll enjoy it
darksouls,ffcu3kg,t1_ffctxpy,1579807286.0,"Damn didn’t even think about that, seems really obvious now"
darksouls,ffcf960,t1_ffcd7t9,1579798192.0,"Just doing some research, I would go with the notched whip if possible, because as you stated, the whips are generally just spiky balls on a chain. Firebombs and throwing knives are good. Issue comes with the stopwatch and the cross/boomerang. I was thinking Iron Flesh for the stopwatch, although it slows you down and not your enemies. But I mean it’s a huge defense boost so it might be like your enemies are slower cause you can tank hits with relatively low damage while inflicting your full damage on the enemy. But the cross/ boomerang is gonna be trouble. Nothing in DS1 comes back to you after throwing it, and at least not to my knowledge

Edit:I’m going off of Simon’s arsenal in the original Castlevania

Nother edit: Not sure if I should just use a battle axe in place of the throwing axe, or if I should look for something else"

darksouls,ffcaicu,t1_ffca14w,1579795233.0,But which shields?
darksouls,ffcadsg,t3_esp1qq,1579795156.0,"Quick comment on parrying


A parry has 3 stages. 



1. Prep

This is when you first hit L2. Your character, depending on the shield or weapon being used, will either bring the shield over to their right side (for medium shields and most small shields) or bring the shield up to their top right (Buckler, Target Shield, Parry Dagger). Other weapons have weird parry animations (scimitar is one, idk how that even counts as a parry but ok), but all have a small amount of time, usually around 3(?) frames before the parry frames start. 



2. Parry

This is when your parry frames are active. This IS NOT when you see your shield swing off to the left, but right before that animation. Medium and most small shields have 6 frames where a parry is possible. The Buckler, Target Shield, and Parry Dagger have 8 parry frames. This is when your shield is at its rightmost point. 



3. Recovery

This is the swinging animation you see when you parry. This is not part of the parry frames, but rather a recovery animation. 


So if you’ve been using the swinging animation to parry, try parrying a second earlier. It takes practice, but it gets amazingly easy one you know how to do it. I practiced on Hollows in the Burg, and I was able to start parrying almost all the enemies in the game."
darksouls,ffc8zha,t1_ffbpqbm,1579794275.0,Holy shit honestly I was gonna say something similar but you’ve covered all of it. Nicely done sir!
darksouls,ffc4qlo,t3_esp580,1579791486.0,"Ok if we’re being real, almost everyone hates the Anor Londo Archers. They’re just artificial difficulty in a area that’s already difficult enough. Putting the Bat Wing Demons on the ledge wasn’t the best design choice. But other than that, Anor Londo is pretty much perfect. Yes O+S are a bitch to beat. It’s a gank. Ganks always suck. Ornstein is fast as fuck and can stunlock you, letting Smough get close enough to splatter you into the floor. But a big problem I generally see is that some new players *aren’t aggressive enough*. Playing the fight too passively will result in you eventually fucking up and getting wombo-comboed into nothing. But if you use the pillars properly, you can keep one boss stuck on a pillar while smacking the other boss. I get why you don’t enjoy the fight. It’s hella difficult and it’s hard to keep track of 2 bosses at the same time. And bugged? Other than Ornstein getting stuck on pretty much anything, I don’t see how it’s buggy. If that’s the only bug you can point out, I can’t see how the fight is bugged. And Ornstein randomly dodging attacks? Enemies do this all the time. Hollow Soldiers don’t always dodge attacks, but they do from time to time. So why say that Ornstein is bullshit for dodging randomly when other enemies do the same thing and you don’t complain about them. Also, why record every single time you died on supposedly your first play through? Did you intend to complain about the game afterwards or did you just decided to do it cause why not? I get why your frustrated by the game, but what you precive as bugs are simply either game mechanics that aren’t implemented in the best way, or it’s a symptom of the game being 13 years old. Yes collision detection problems exist in the game. But a lot of this is just frustration at a game that didn’t let you breeze through. Calling everything that’s not optimized for the game by 2020 standards isn’t fair to a game that’s over a decade old. So yes, I understand your frustration. But not everything is broken just because you don’t agree with the way the game is made."
