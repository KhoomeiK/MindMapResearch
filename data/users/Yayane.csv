socialanxiety,feeu7yk,t3_enw3su,1579041315.0,"When I was in pre school. My teachers told my mother that i never interacted with the other children and would just sit there. I've always been labeled shy despite having friends but it wasn't until senior year in high school when someone said, ""I'm convinced you dont talk to us because you dont like us"" after I did an energetic presentation. I'm doing better now, but I never realized I had an issue until like 3 years ago."
socialanxiety,feets44,t3_enk0w2,1579041043.0,Ignore those people. Speaking up when you have social anxiety is a great step and you shouldn't let idiots ruin that for you. You're doing great.
socialanxiety,feet19c,t3_envgmo,1579040588.0,What a great start! This is just the beginning.
socialanxiety,feerrv9,t1_feer2jk,1579039821.0,"Just remember that you aren't annoying. When I feel anxious it's usually because I worry how I'm gonna come off as. Dont worry about that, if you are concerned about being annoying then odds are you arent annoying. 

Even if you do feel like you are, still send it. Not sending it means anxiety wins. You must defeat the beast!"
socialanxiety,feeqx0b,t3_eonio0,1579039308.0,"Ask her questions. I've noticed talking about myself is hard, but asking questions is a bit easier. It's a good start."
socialanxiety,feeqqdk,t3_eoo4w0,1579039201.0,"Stuff like that isn't exactly preventable it's just your bodies way of being anxious. Its embarrassing and sucks but you just have to work on not being nervous. This is the hard part, but doable. I've practically conquered it without therapy so I think it's possible it just depends on the person. You just have to take baby steps. Make a doable social goal for yourself and try your best to achieve it. You will fail at first, but eventually if you keep at it. You'll get better. It's a hard process but possible."
socialanxiety,feepxha,t3_eolqyh,1579038736.0,"Dont stare but looking down can make you seem vulnerable, just glance at them and keep on going."
socialanxiety,feepog3,t3_eopo9m,1579038594.0,"I used to feel the same way. One day, I told myself I'm gonna say hello to one person today or I'm gonna interject one time in a group setting. You will fail alot, but you will get better. It was around your age i started this so it's not too late for you to become a decently social person. Itll be hard but you can do it, I believe in you!"
socialanxiety,feep3ox,t3_eorkxw,1579038262.0,"This is gonna sound crazy but the best way is by talking to people. I get it, easier than it sounds, however, it's really the only way. Start with a goal in mind, I'm going to say hello to one person today. You may not succeed at first but keep trying until you do. Then increase it gradually. 

In a group setting? Make a goal to interject at least one time. Even if it's the only thing you say the whole time. It won't work all the time, you will fail at times. But you WILL get better. Trust me, I was super socially anxious too. You can do this!"
socialanxiety,feeoequ,t3_eom81l,1579037859.0,"Ahhh... cancelling plans. Easy to do, but you often have regrets afterwards. When I feel the urge to cancel, I do everything I can to fight it. Social anxiety is a beast to fight and can be overpowering but one step at a time, it can be overcome. You just have to resist the urges."
socialanxiety,feeo79m,t3_eopups,1579037738.0,"It doesn't make you selfish. Keep in touch is the hardest thing for me, however, if you want to get better at it then it's not too late to start. It may even help you with your social anxiety"
socialanxiety,feenyz1,t3_eolajg,1579037603.0,An important step is identifying why you feel anxious. What makes you cry when you come from school?
socialanxiety,feena4g,t3_eoqdc8,1579037205.0,"Me as well, dont think about it too much though. The fact is, you are not dumb which leaves plenty of opportunities to prove them wrong."
socialanxiety,feen0qt,t3_eopzlt,1579037057.0,"I'm really sorry that anxiety won today, but remember that it doesn't mean you are a lost cause. The fact is that the only way to get past social anxiety is to put yourself in these situations. It's hard and scary but possible. Remember that you are great and qualified and deserve a great job that will make you happy. Next time you get an interview, know that you can do it and resist cancelling it even though that's the easier route. Nothing worth doing is easy. You can do this! 

Sincerely, a fellow anxious person."
90DayFiance,feekcms,t1_fedb6lu,1579035503.0,"I see where you're coming from but just like you said, you're not introverted or have social anxiety, therefore it is difficult to understand why someone can behave in such a way. 

Shy and socially anxious are two very different things. This is coming from a person who at one point had extreme social anxiety. Jasmine shows behaviors that mirror social anxiety, it can make you seem disinterested and deadpan. It can be very difficult to say anything, even doing something as simple as responding to a question. I'm not saying that her behavior isn't a problem because anxiety isn't a good thing to have in general, but it isn't easy to stop those behaviors. 

The annoying thing is that you're saying it takes more effort to be like Jasmine than it is to interact socially but that is a close minded opinion to have. The fact is not everyone is extroverted or social like you, so dont assume it is so easy."
AskReddit,fd3cyij,t3_ejro6w,1578157027.0,When my great uncle sat and had a real conversation with me. I've always been really quiet and felt like everyone had always ignored me but for the first time someone really tried with me. We spoke about everything and I discovered feelings and opinions I had that I had never realized before. He died a few months later from cancer he was battling for a few years. I wish I told him how much I appreciated that conversation before he died.
AskReddit,fca2iru,t3_egqchb,1577562098.0,I would gain about 30 pounds which wouldn't be good because I'm super short.
MSLGame,f6p6gei,t1_f6oowzh,1573048761.0,Ohhhh. Thanks.
