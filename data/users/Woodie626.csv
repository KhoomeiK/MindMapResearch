No, the party that let Net Neutrality die is not the same as the party trying to save it.
No, the party that has been trying to privatize Medicare for the past half decade is not the same as the party flirting with Medicare For All.
No, the party that immediately set to detoothing and neutering the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Bill is not the same as the party that passed it.
No, the party that held the middle class hostage to defend Bush era tax cuts is not the same as the party that begged to raise taxes on the top 1%.
No, the party that included a provision in tax reform to raise taxes on college students is not the same as the party trying to make college debt free.  
No, the party that is trying to pass a $1,500,000,000,000 ($1.5 trillion with a T) tax cut for millionaires and billionaires is not the same as the party opposing it.
No, the party that has spent the past eight years doing everything in their power to destroy the Affordable Care Act is not the same as the party protecting it.
No, the party that regularly and loudly speak out against the very existence of a minimum wage is not the same as the party trying to raise it to $12-$15 per hour.
No, the party that fear mongered about “What happens if a woman gets her period during a firefight!?” is not the same as the party working to give women equal roles in combat.
No, the party passing trap laws and requiring Doctors to perform medically unnecessary transvaginal ultrasounds is not the same as the party fighting for a woman’s right to choose.
No, the party that wants to pass a constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between one man and one woman is not the same as the party fighting to protect gay rights.
No, the party that is going out of their way at the state and federal level to make voting harder to do is not the same as the party fighting for more polling places and longer early voting.
No, the party that believes “Climate change is a Chinese hoax” and “God promised Noah he would never flood the earth again” and “Look, I have a snowball” is not the same as the party that believes in science.

I didn’t mention one single party name in that list, but you, dear reader, you knew exactly who I was talking about.

Still don’t believe me that the parties aren’t the same? Okay, riddle me this, do you know which party is which in the examples I listed above? Because unless you think that Democrats have been fighting to overturn Roe vs Wade, and Republicans are trying to raise the minimum wage, then you have no excuse for believing the “they’re the same!” talking point. 

Yeah, there is some shit that the parties line up on, policies that both parties support like CHIP (Until this year, when Republicans let it die) or the Violence Against Women Act (Until Republicans almost let it lapse during the Obama years), or raising the debt ceiling (Until tea party Republicans almost didn’t raise it), but those commonalities are father and father between, and hardly reflect the reality of modern American politics.
