This is NOT an 'art' subreddit despite those three letters in 'artisan'.  This is not the place to spam your mixtape or whatever category of thing you've decided is art.  ""But it's my OC"", ""I own the copyrights to this"", and ""BUT IT'S ART!"" are not an excuse when this entire type of post isn't allowed.
