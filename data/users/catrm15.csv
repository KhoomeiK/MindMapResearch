survivinginfidelity,fgjclj7,t3_eyok5b,1580841227.0,I NEEDED THIS. I decided to make my own list of mistakes vs choice. The very first time he hungout with her was a mistake. Everytime after that was a choice
survivinginfidelity,fg85jc3,t1_fg84j2v,1580610086.0,I actually started reading it earlier today! I'm definitely going to read the whole thing. Thank you!
survivinginfidelity,fg84fnu,t1_fg833wu,1580609261.0,"Thank you for this and thank you for actually taking the time to read my other posts. You're absolutely 100% right. If I don't get my confidence back that he destroyed, I'll get sucked right back in. I actually decided to get out of bed and am going out to the bar with some friends. I imagine that's a first step towards healing, deciding to go do shit instead of laying in bed depressed"
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fg5kje6,t1_fg4yyh3,1580530000.0,"LOL drove past his house and he had a girl over! Called him and he answered whispering, I asked who was at his house, he refused to tell me saying ""I don't have to tell you that"" I threatened to go back to his house and in a high whisper he told me not to. Needless to say, I blocked him on everything and I'm fucking done. This was a blessing in disguise!"
AsOneAfterInfidelity,fg5c5lz,t1_fg4yyh3,1580523609.0,"Thank you for your response. I think it's number 1 based on the discussion we had tonight. I did end things. Obviously deep down I hope he changes and comes back to me a new man but I know the chances are slim. I will definitely check that book out, anything to help me get through this"
