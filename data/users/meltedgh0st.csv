TrueFilm,ffiogj9,t1_ffi5hna,1579978765.0,"didn't want to show affection, or physically couldn't do it ?  there are things i've wanted to express in my past relationships, but literally just could not do it. even with therapy. there are things i'm capable of now that i wish i had been able to do in relationships from years ago. it just wasn't the right time. i feel for her character. she reminds me of a very young version of myself."
TrueFilm,ffio6t5,t3_ethejn,1579978584.0,"this is a beautiful analogy, i don't think you're reading too much into it. it seems like it was put into the film on purpose to illustrate these parallels. nice catch!"
LetsNotMeet,ffinvc6,t3_etpfik,1579978367.0,"Let's Not Meet was recently mentioned in a No Sleep Podcast story. that might have something to do with it ?   my ears perked up when they mentioned the sub & i figured something like this might happen.  it will probably stop after a couple of weeks, or the posters will realize what the sub is actually for."

AskMen,ffdpn2r,t3_esruuu,1579825964.0,Not a guy but as a woman I don’t really care about something like that. It seems weird and untrustworthy to care. I don’t like jewelry either so I think it would be annoying having something always on my hand & unfair to expect someone else to wear something all the time to show that I “own”(?) them (?!)

insaneparents,ffa543d,t1_ffa08k4,1579728061.0,"Insane. lmfao sounds like both of my parents. I had anorexia (triggered by their behaviors) from age 9-19, then tried recovery & they said I looked “great” when I gained 20lbs (was still underweight) but when I gained more (pregnancy) at age 21 they told me I looked like a whale & said they would “pray for me” that the “blubber” melted off. I lost weight after childbirth and they acted concerned and said they hoped I wasn’t “puking” again (not something I ever did, I just restricted) - needless to say I stopped speaking to my dad before he died & don’t plan on speaking with my mom again, ever. Toxic pieces of garbage. I feel so bad for this girl because I know how she feels."
