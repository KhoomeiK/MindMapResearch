Guitar,ff20yfk,t1_ff1y453,1579490874.0,Damn gotta get that protein somehow I guess.
college,fen8nv2,t1_fen155z,1579279384.0,No. I actually prefer the smell of sprouted mung beans to the stench of this man.
college,femwamk,t1_femtslt,1579271287.0,"Yeah but it’s not like he’s doing it maliciously. He’s probably just depressed or doesn’t know better.

Who hurt you"
college,femtbew,t1_femioxm,1579269010.0,"Jesus man. Th be a little too far. He’s a nicer kid and all, just smells bad."
college,fekxqmy,t1_fekussk,1579209782.0,"It is much cheaper to live out of the frat. The thing is to join you gotta sign a contract that says that they have the right to force you to live in for 2 years and if you don’t they can charge you for it anyways. It’s fucked but I love living there besides the roommate. 

I disagree though. I think he can be however unhygienic he wants, until the point where it starts negatively effecting other people. Like no one in the house wants to be near him bc of it."
college,fekpzqf,t1_fekns6k,1579205210.0,He weighed a solid 150lb less when he got a bid. It’s only gotten worse
college,fekpxb1,t1_fekp4yg,1579205170.0,Nope. Funny though because he loves post Malone
college,fejpyd0,t1_fejpkdz,1579182851.0,"Not the case. He has tons of laundry stuff, never seen him touch it. Idek where he keeps his laundry. 

The kid is loaded, he should at least be able to Afford a laundry service like 90% of my house does. 

I think that’s what I’m gonna have to do. It’s so frustrating bc I’m afraid to have anyone in my room bc I don’t want them to think I smell like that."
KGATLW,fehx3tw,t3_eowosh,1579125598.0,All you got on me is the joint. Check mate
msu,fe46sss,t1_fe46n09,1578856302.0,It was a loose leaf and they don’t allow it after it’s open
msu,fe45s44,t3_ennyhh,1578856089.0,Well I wish I saw this 2 days ago. There goes $250
msu,fdiaylo,t3_elji4l,1578438935.0,You can just google requirements for any major. But yes
educationalgifs,fdh5obv,t1_fdgv1x0,1578415921.0,"Well I’m assuming what’s in your hair is it’s metabolites, and I don’t really know much about their chemistry. Them degrading is the only reasonable explanation I can think of for why it lasts so short in your hair. If that is what it is, sitting in the sun and showering would help it all degrade and get it out of your hair faster."
educationalgifs,fdglo11,t1_fdgckch,1578401500.0,"LSD is a very unstable molecule. It degrades easily with light, heat, and water. So I’m assuming that’s what it is."
RedHotChiliPeppers,fc61kb3,t1_fc5em19,1577470188.0,This is true
RedHotChiliPeppers,fc5czix,t1_fc51b4q,1577453766.0,Nah Bssm is my favorite. Just never heard any of my friends talking about this one
Songwriting,fc4exxg,t3_eg4pz9,1577414699.0,"Yeah that kind of stuff works. If I do something like that, I usually like to add effects or change the tone of my guitar, or maybe switch instruments, but that is by no means necessary.  As long as you feel it has the emotion you want in it, it is perfect"
Songwriting,fc3tlnp,t1_fc3tbfr,1577398299.0,For sure thank you! I’ll check that out. Some practice at composing would probably really improve some of my writing so thank you
sciences,fb55e2g,t1_fb54f1b,1576521302.0,"One modern theory is that life started on volcanic ducts on the sea floor. The ducts provided heat and minerals, which allowed for life to form. I may be incorrect on this last part, but I believe the first step in life was self-replicating RNA molecules (RNA is an essential part of all life for those who’re unaware). I also remember hearing that some chemical coming out of the ducts allowed for cell membranes to form, but I don’t remember clearly on that one."
