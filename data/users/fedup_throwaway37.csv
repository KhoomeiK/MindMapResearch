If you really just want to get the physical part done, there are women who do it for money, some will even give the GFE and make it at least FEEL genuine and authentic.

God has a different plan for me? Or the programmers, aliens, whatever? Well here’s my middle finger for them to see, as I tell them “FUCK YOU!” 

You’re going to try to control my life as an all powerful entity, I’m at least not going to cooperate and accept it like a little beta bitch. 

Send me to Hell? Bitch please, I’m already there, Earth is Hell, or at least society? I don’t know.

I’m no ones beta bitch cuck, not even God’s, or the programmers of this simulation, or aliens watching over this zoo (Google alien zoo theory) or whatever the fuck the truth may be. I won’t cooperate with their plan for me. If they are still able to stop me from ultimately getting what I desire, I at least won’t give them the satisfaction of being happy about it and thanking them for the bs life they gave me.

I thought God was supposed to give everybody freewill? Not have plans for us that are out of our control.

God didn’t save me from my dad drinking, from bullying in school, from what happened to me to make me have to stay in a psychiatric hospital, from being stuck at home and then almost becoming homeless when I tried to get out and become independent (and me getting robbed and almost beaten during that), and a step dad who has been more abusive SOBER than my dad ever was DRUNK?

selfimprovement,ffa6luv,t1_ff92h97,1579728889.0,"A lot of people on Reddit say Jordan Peterson is an incel, is he or no?

Also, are you saying most women will leave a man who loses it to her in general? Or just because of my current state?

That reinforces how bad it is for me to have zero experience at my age? Should I pay a pro? I feel that may make me feel even worse though, and what if I can never get laid without paying, and just can’t connect with anyone? That’s not much better than being a complete foreveralone virgin.

Is it just inevitable that I have to start these things even later, because I’m so behind and life is demanding I catch up in other aspects first?

For the immediate future, I at least want to know that it’s physically possible for a woman to be willing to have sex with me without paying.

I highly doubt you know how I feel.

Even if I end up on my own making good money at 30 (I DO NOT want to enter my 30s still as a foreveralone virgin, so much youth, just gone, it’s not something to joke about, it’s just sad) won’t my inexperience be a turnoff? Like, would Steve Carrel’s Andy the 40 Year Old Virgin have a real chance in real life without having to pay a prostitute?

Sure, having my own place to play all the videogames I want would be cool, but it’d get lonely, and I biologically crave intimacy. It’d be awful to lose my libido and never even had sex, but I’d probably kill myself before that point, or most certainly after.

selfimprovement,ff8nqn6,t1_ff8mg0k,1579687801.0,"I actually have been thinking about deleting all the social media (excepting Reddit accounts for entertainment/fantheories, and FaceBook since thats for old friends/family and I virtually never even use it).

I have been in a psychiatric ward, but I was a teenager.

I actually explained what I meant, but I did type a sea of text, I had no way of getting into town (it was a rural/remote area) and my parents (mostly just my mom because my parents divorced and step dad was gone for months at a time) wouldn’t drive me into town to try and get a job. 

And yes, I did try walking and bicycling into town, it was just physically too much for my body, 3 hours and I still wasn’t in town. I got a ride, BACK HOME! The place that kept me!

I probably sound ridiculous, well being shacked up like that 24/7 ate away a lot if my mind. 

I’d say it had lasting effects. I’ve considered seeing psychics to tell me the future (one time I just happened to walk by one, I had escaped home, but quickly ended up broke so I couldn’t afford it, other family took me in, and my parents moved into the city a few months later so I moved back to escape the hick town where everybody ganged up on me and ruined my reputation before I even had one!).

And I literally today, just thought of finding a psychic to tell me if I am doomed to a life of loneliness and celibacy.

Yeah, I’m getting that desperate, I’m not going to accept my fate this early on in life without going to desperate measures (desperate times call for desperate measures).

Besides, the possibility that psychics can see the future would be a lot more logical than BLIND FAITH.

I still remember the day when my brain had a permanent change, it was when my rage started (I’m in medication for that now, it’s been pretty effective). I had these really vivid dreams that I still remember, which is pretty freaky. That was the day I stood up to my dad (blow up, I could have been arrested if they called the cops, I’ve somehow still never been arrested, and I’ve had other rage outbursts, medication seems to have blocked them though!)

If this is true, I’m going to be checking out soon, I’m not going through life as a lonely celibate loser, I’ll just fall into the incel trap, I’m not living this way!

If I don’t kill myself, I’m going to become an alcoholic and/or a drug addict, alcoholism runs in my family.

If doing what society says you’re supposed to do doesn’t provide the rewards, it’s a waste of time playing.

I know the future! Well, based on MY past, and other people’s present, it feels like it’s confirmed fo be my future. I can prevent myself from suffering this fate, it’s in MY HANDS! 

This is the only thing I TRULY wanted in life, without love and sex (paid or hookup sex won’t fill the hole) everything else is meaningless.

I just wanted to be part of the human experience.

This is why we have TEENAGERS already wanting to die for being foreveralone virgins, and some becoming incels, because of the bleak future of older people who just confirm our fears.

Usually when I see comments like yours, I find a ton of incel bs in the users post history, but surprisingly, you seem to be clean, maybe you’re just a lurker, or maybe you’re just a genuine nice guy who is a victim to “fate”, a “cosmic plaything”, I feel I’m a “cosmic plaything” myself.

GODDAMIT, I’ve been losing sleep over this bullshit, it’s distracting me from schoolwork too. But really, what is the point of getting a degree and a good career if I’m just going to be long-term/lifetime lonely and celibate?

virgin,ff5jt6z,t3_eroi7r,1579596246.0,"You’re only 18, probably just graduating high school this spring?

If you go to college, there’s your chance. If not, it’s still better in general after high school, those girls are generally immature and overly superficial anyway. 

But 18 is WAY too young to decide you’ll be a virgin for life, you haven’t even spent any time as a real adult yet! 

You just became a LEGAL adult (really not a biological adult), you can’t declare stuff like this already, honestly I think it’s good that you’re still a Virgin at 18 years old. 

When you’re nearing 25, like me, it’ll be more of a real concern, hopefully you won’t still have that problem.

Also, when/if anyone asks if you’re a virgin (I made the same mistake of telling some guys who weren’t really my friends too) YOU CAN LIE! They won’t know! If they don’t believe you, they likely won’t care enough to keep talking about it. But you can just insist you did it with a girlfriend or friend or whatever, just say they don’t live in your town or city or whatever, they won’t be able to fact check it.

sex,ff4xtc6,t1_ff4m6wm,1579575030.0,"So, I should lie and maybe just say “I haven’t done it in awhile”? Or something like that?

I definitely don’t want to be a dom, I want a domme, The kind of actual relationship I want is a gentlefemdom dynamic, it’s just what I’m into. I guess it’s like, my sexuality (which can’t be changed).

I don’t know if sexuality is the right term, but it’s a part of my sexuality, I guess? And sexuality is not a choice, and kinks and fetishes are just a part of us as sexuality. I actually remember having my fetishes since I was a small child, they were just innocent and weren’t sexual before puberty, now they’re a sexual thing.

It’s a real shame I never got to explore my sexuality with any girls/women, and I’m not close to being in a life position to now. Now I need to be financially independent, have my own place, have a career lined up (or at least a decent full time job), or at least be able to start these things in the near if not immediate future.

Due to circumstances which weren’t necessarily my fault, I’m just starting community college at 24 years old (now I qualify for financial aid, some I don’t even have to pay back!) living with my parents, bagging groceries when I should be in a career and renting my own apartment, and taking Uber everywhere when my parents can’t drive, because I just got over the fear of driving (really I just decided it’s better to live and risk getting in a wreck than just sit at home) but can’t practice on a weekly basis!

Honestly, the fear of driving has been a HUGE life cripple, it’s why I couldn’t leave the house for two years out in the country (and my parents refused to drive me).

It’s a shame that the majority of women follow that traditional gender crap, wanting the men to be dominant, or just being vanilla and not kinky at all.

I’m cursed, I’m into such niche things, and I’m already widely considered physically unattractive, which spills over into hurting mental health and personality.

Hopelessness grows saying “The odds of a normal person who’s on schedule in life have a low chance at finding this, what chance does your late blooming ass have, it only gets harder and harder....”

Maybe I need to ultimately move to a more progressive/liberal place?

I don’t want to be that man who takes control of everything and does the dominating, maybe switch roles on OCCASION (she could even MAKE me fuck her from top, to keep it still femdom) but I do not have that “traditional personality”. 

I could never be with a submissive woman, and just vanilla no kink at all? Boring.

I hope what I’m into won’t prevent me from truly connecting with someone, even if that someone is a woman with a mommy domme personality. I still want to connect, not a relationship that’s ONLY about kink. I still want raw PIV too, but she can be dominant for that too, maybe switching roles on occasion....
