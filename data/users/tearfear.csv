AdviceAnimals,ffhvms4,t3_etn1zi,1579955982.0,I think because historically dentistry was considered a trade and not a medical subfield. Dentistry and medicine have remained separate out of tradition mostly - although I have heard it argued that not having to go through the fray of med school allows dentists to specialize more intensively. Could the same not be said for every subfield though? Moreover should we not expect every specialist to be as informed about their area as dentists? And all doctors to be at least somewhat informed about teeth?

There is a lot I could respond to in your comment, but I will be somewhat selective: Trump making decisions which have gotten many killed? Er such as? (And if you want to suggest Iran shooting down that plane, do you not think Iran bears any responsibility? Was it not America's fault when they shot down Iran Air 655 in 1988?) In regards to racism, you sort of leave a door open which I will walk through. I do not think that Trump himself is a racist in any meaningful way. But I do also think that he is a race-baiter, and while I myself believe that issues of race are vastly overstated in contemporary politics (just my opinion), I think Trump does make it harder to achieve a post-race society with some of his rhetoric. So yes I will grant you that point, but it's a half-way point, because I still don't think Trump himself is an actual racist (would an actual racist have people of colour in his cabinet? Would an actual racist use low black unemployment as a point of achievement? People who are actual racists (like David Duke) say that Trump has done nothing for them). 

Here is the real issue I take however, what I was trying to say in my first point. You are essentially doubling down on the cons without even touching the pros. We're talking about a trade off: there are items on both sides, and you can choose which items are more persuasive. Your effort would be much better spent arguing against the pros than it would against the cons, because the question really isn't ""is taking children away from their parents justifiable?"" It is ""are other things Trump has done significant enough for people to ignore taking children from their parents?"" Nobody thought it was a good idea (and it wasn't Trump's idea either, and when they realized how badly it was going he put a stop to it; and now both Jeff Sessions and John Kelly, the two people primarily responsible, have been fired). But if you want to talk about the improved relations with North Korea, the economic showdown with China (tariffs are bad short term; an economic relationship with China would be hugely beneficial to both countries in the long run); the withdrawing of troops in the middle east, or any of the other points that I made as to why people actually like Trump, be my guest.

As a specific point, I don't have so much of a problem with people who don't like Trump as I do with people who think any support of him is wholly unjustifiable. Let's go through the list:

Cons:

\- Challenging personality

\- Alienates allies who could help him achieve his goals more expediently (e.g. EU, Iraq)

\- Separation of children from parents at border

\- Tax policy (if that's a big issue for you)

\- Questionable legal standing (emphasis on questionable).

Pros:

\- Reducing America's military presence internationally (e.g. Iraq, Afghanistan)

\- Opening ties with North Korea

\- Bringing China to the trade table

\- New NAFTA

\-  Focus on border security (it needs to happen, for the long term stability of legal immigration in America also)

\- Historical low unemployment, including African American unemployment.

You can say that the cons are more persuasive. You can say that the pros are more persuasive. But what you can't say is that anyone who takes one side of a trade off is an evil human being. Just because people disagree with you, even if you're right, it doesn't necessarily make them wrong. It may just mean they are looking at the issue from a different perspective."

TumblrInAction,fey7mqp,t3_eqrnht,1579441833.0,"There is definitely more to diversity than race, sexuality, or gender. Human beings are extremely diversified, depending on their professions, personalities, life experiences, and countlessly many other factors. Diversity in this way is extremely beneficial in ways that merely hiring the ""best"" candidate might not be. There is a synergistic value in having a diverse range of opinions on hand that may be missed by simply hiring the best (according to some likely arbitrary metric).

I think to focus so strongly on notions of race, gender, and sexuality misses the true beauty of diversity... that people bear a fantastic array of different perspectives, many of which are valuable in and of themselves. Obviously merit still rules, but there is some flexibility as to what it means to merit a position. Having a specific perspective could be seen as legitimate merit."

Most however are going to places like Vietnam or Bangladesh, which doesn't quite solve the problem of outsourcing, but does solve one problem in weakening China's stance in relation to the United States. 

You don't believe any president could stop China's IP theft and yet Trump's economic retaliations are bringing China to the table. So... maybe some American president could do something to stop China's delinquency after all. But even still it's about more than manufacturing... low-level manufacturing jobs are likely gone from America forever in large part. But that doesn't change the fact that America is still the largest economy in the world and is the world's 2nd largest producer of goods (after guess who?). The current dynamic has China stealing more in IP theft from the US than their entire net purchasing from America. That is a crisis! And Trump is the first president who has done anything to stop it. China should want a solution because having American goods readily available can propel their economy. China is cutting off their nose to spite their face, and it would be a real shame is some other (Democratic) president would renege on the tariffs and give China back everything they want without asking anything in return.

Not like you need my blessing for your views but I do think your opinion is reasonable. Trump is a huckster yes, but his foreign policy in particular has many impressive components, and the question people are asking is: does the chance of a better life promised by say, better economic relations with China and fewer troops in the middle east - is that worth having a huckster (liar/sexual deviant/etc) as president?

Three million people are off food stamps. And yes, even this hottest topic of late, killing a terrorist general who was planning on bombing the US embassy in Baghdad is a preemptive strike that saved Americans - and given that both Trump and Iran respect reciprocal military action, has *prevented* a war rather than started one.

When it comes to hard work - it is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. As Thomas Sowell said, Bill Gates might have more money than some countries, but he's also created more wealth than some countries. The reality is, what is seen by the have-nots as exploitation is seen by the haves as the creation of wealth. And no, that's not fair all of the time, like when it comes to the actual exploitation of workers. 

But here's the thing about working hard. Not only is it the thing that every single successful person cites as the reason for their success (maybe there's something to that, eh?) - but hard work is also fundamentally the only thing in this world that you can control. If you are saying to society: O you are so advanced and yet you provide nothing to me for free? Replies society: I give you the tools of modern technology and free enterprise to make your way as far as you can. We all want progress, we all want development; those take resources and they take work. How are we supposed to push the dial and create a better society if we aren't willing to work as hard as we can to make it happen? 

This has applications any way you look at it. On the governmental or global scale, for corporations, in your community, in your family, or just for yourself. Working for development is the thing that successful people do to make themselves successful. I'm not exactly sure what Jeff Bezos is up to on a Tuesday afternoon... but I can guarantee you that the CEO of let's say American Airlines is not the CEO because he floated his way to the top. People who consistently make good decisions wind up in advantageous places because the deck is stacked against people who are not successful. This is a reality of evolution. It is a law of nature. 

Here's one final (of many) ways of looking at it. My first boss always told me: work smarter, not harder. The most successful people are the ones who are working the smartest, not necessarily the hardest. When it comes to economic capacity and ability to create wealth (especially in an increasingly tech-based economy), the ability to work smart is becoming all the more crucial."

AdviceAnimals,fdev3k2,t1_fdefr2u,1578347224.0,"It's not that he's so stupid he'll do anything - Trump's actions are not at all erratic, only his rhetoric. Case in point: a few months ago he called off a strike that would have killed around 115 Iranian civilians as reciprocation for Iran having shot down an unarmed US drone. Trump said that he didn't feel such a strike would be a proportionate response, and wanted to avoid a loss of life if he could. This was against the advice of his military leadership, and in my opinion was absolutely the right decision (or to put it another way, striking Iran would have been a catastrophically wrong decision, and Trump was the only one who seemed to realize it). 

Trump has commented that being erratic and contradictory like this has served him quite well over his career/s. I can see why, because it's obviously frustrating to work with and makes people acquiesce to him so they don't have to see what's behind door #2. Part of the reason this works is because the US military and economy are the strongest in the world and so there is a credible threat when he says that he will rain hellfire upon a country, even though this makes the American public and media shit its pants every single time.

In terms of what Iran's response will be, it's pointless to speculate on hypotheticals. Part of what made 9/11 so significant was it was not targeted at American interests all over the world: it was targeted at American interests in America. I just make this distinction because it is hard to conceive of a 9/11-type scenario that is not a direct attack on the United States, as 9/11 was. But moreover - insanity, not stupidity. What does the Islamic Republic have to gain from perpetrating this? If they did this every country in NATO would immediately be at war with them. The regime would be changed over night. Even more to the point, the reason for them wanting a nuke has more to do with threatening Saudi Arabia and Israel than it does the United States - so again, Trump's single bullet point that Iran cannot have a nuke is for exactly the same kind of reason that you are describing - ditto killing Soleimani - it is so that Iran has a lesser chance of committing crimes like this, not greater."

It is news to nobody that people have strong opinions about it, so while it makes me raise am eyebrow, I don't think I can really say anything definitive about it beyond what I believe already. 

When I read Trump's tweet yesterday about the 52 targets the first thing that went through my mind was: I've seen this movie before. Trump's #1 accomplishment to date for me has been his defrosting of ties with North Korea. Meeting Kim Jong-un was something I thought Obama should have done, and seeing Trump do it was a major reason why my opinion of him has changed over his presidency. But prancing across the DMZ together began with fire and fury! Donald Trump's rhetoric - explosive and irresponsible! - brought two nations much closer together in a very important way. 

It is a difficult argument to make, and I'm not trying to make you agree, only to see it from the other perspective... I think it is genius by insanity. The Iranians, the North Koreans (by which I mean their leaders) are absolutely insane, there's little denying that. But they aren't stupid. Trump is the same way, an insane genius... And he is speaking their language right back at them. Is he crazy enough to target 52 sites in Iran? So thinks Iran: maybe he is, he already killed our general! Will Iran risk this? Is Trump insane enough?

Iran's economy and military is 40 years out of date. They do not presently have a nuclear weapon. They are crippled by international sanctions and their people despise their government. A war with the United States is a decisive loss for Iran. They know this. Their options are risk the loss of everything they have, or cooperate with Trump and solidify their legitimacy with the country who has already extended opened arms (literally) with another nuclear power that has cooperated with them. If the Islamic Republic wants anything except complete destruction of their country, they will cooperate. That is 4D chess as far as I'm concerned."

The Iran deal, whether Iran was or wasn't actually adhering to it, was not a long term solution. Obama signed it because he knew he wasn't going to get a better deal without going to war. That's all well and good, but even Obama knew that future presidents would need to renegotiate if Iran was actually going to be non-nuclear in the long term. Now I have said earlier in this thread that if I was the president I would not have abandoned the treaty, ok? Chalk that up to a disagreement I have with Trump, an agreement I have with you! Take a victory on this point... WE AGREE, OK?! 

Now on the issue about what Trump's objectives are, I think it is very clear. He has said expressly and clearly that he isn't interested in regime change, he doesn't want Iran to have a nuke. Why should I not believe this? The crucial component is that Iran deal - in the estimation of the president and his administration (among many others) - DID NOT BELIEVE THE IRAN DEAL WAS GOING TO PREVENT IRAN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR BOMB. OK? Don't call me stupid, this is a nuanced point. The diplomatic option Obama signed was a short term deal and not a long term solution. It was not going to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear, and Trump tore it up for *precisely* that reason. 

Don't defend the Islamic Republic. Killing a terrorist is a war crime? Even if it is, is this really the hill you want to die on? How dare the president kill an active terrorist acting as part of an authoritarian theocratic fascist regime. This conversation started with you being afraid this would precipitate war. Now it is a war crime to assassinate a terrorist? I don't think you're being altogether consistent.

I wouldn't say it's unreasonable if you blame Trump for marring the US-Iraq relationship over this, but I do think there's a bigger picture here. 

You have to understand that the Islamic Republic of Iran is barely a legitimate government if at all. The government is in contempt of the people and the nation - effectively holding them hostage in order to build a nuke. How much room is there to negotiate around this? What is the diplomatic option for a terrorist with command over a large sector of the Iranian military? Obama tried already to be diplomatic with Iran, and the Iran deal did basically nothing to ensure that Iran would be a long term non-nuclear power. 

Trump has a crystal clear objective. Iran cannot have a nuke. It is not about regime change per se... I 100% support regime change in Iran, but I think that it should be brought about by the Iranian people and not by foreign governments. Eventually - and I think Obama thought this too when he signed the Iran deal - eventually the Iranian people will remove the Islamic Republic from power. But until that happens, I have very little sympathy for diplomatic overreaches or what have you. Am I supposed to feel sorry for Iran because Soleimani was killed?

This isn't the first time we've seen technology rapidly replacing obsolete jobs, as it did in the industrial revolution. Moreover history should tell us that new technology is an indicator of new opportunities much more than it is of lost ones.

Who benefited from this was whoever set the wage and earned the benefits of the productivity growth. As I suggested, too low a minimum wage can make employers undercut the value of labour if there are not adequate protections or a diversified enough economy to prevent this from occurring. Since the US is increasingly becoming industry-by-monopoly; and especially since so much labour has been outsourced to the developing world, the expected wage growth is happening in China, not America.

I have supported improved access to mental health and addictions treatment in my own country (Canada), so I'm not about to argue against something I strongly agree with.
