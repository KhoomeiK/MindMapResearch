The problems largely stem from Apple's side.

If I want to develop an app for android, I just need a computer and about $25. You can download the development kits, dev environments, emulators, basically everything for free. Java is a very commonly known programming language that is right up there with Python as everyone's first programming language. You can install an app you compile to your own phone without red tape. I've never actually uploaded an app, but from what I've heard the fee to upload to the google play store is a one time $25 fee.

If I want to develop an app for ios, I will need a Mac, $100 per year, and additional education. I took a college course in app development for ios with the xcode environment and objective C, a weird programming language that Apple pushed on devs until they moved to Swift-which I never bothered to learn because of how annoying it is to develop for ios in general. You have to register your phone as a development device in order to download your app on your own phone without uploading. You also have to pay $100 a year to have permission to upload and maintain apps on the store.

Now, there ARE toolkits to develop cross-platform apps, but it's generally only easy to do these things from the start.

Tl;dr: Apple's obsession with exclusivity extends to development where they prefer you to get caught in their proprietary framework and ensnare you as a fulltime ios shop."

IsItBullshit,fes6yyz,t3_eqbjdj,1579362036.0,"I will try to get back once I double-check. I work in an office at a HVAC laboratory so I can probe for a better answer. I am unfortunately not an HVAC engineer myself, but I get some secondhand info. It's not as simple as all these armchair high school physicists are claiming it is, there are a lot of curvy graphs involved.

For now I will say not **always** bullshit.

You will have to take into account the size of the unit, the insulation in your home, duration that you are gone, weather, etc.

The ""off is more efficient"" response is a bit oversimplified and basically assumes perfect heat rejection and terrible insulation.

Heat rejection tech is imperfect. Cooling efficiency is going to decrease as the heat builds up in the condenser. You get better cooling efficiency if your condenser stays cooler, and cooling in small quantities with time in between (or, if you have a variable frequency compressor, running part load) is going to keep the average temperature of the condenser lower while you cool.

That said, then you have to consider the insulation in your home. Poor insulation is going to let a lot of heat in, making the unit run more when you are out.

Overall, in a simplified home with an A/C unit and insulation, lets say that hypothetically cooling over the day with the thermostat up cools on average at 3x the efficiency than just cooling all at once when you get home. If it takes an hour to cool all at once to your desired temperature, then that means running the light load is going to be worse if you are out for over 3 hours.

It's also worth noting somewhere in here that if you have decent insulation and you turn your thermostat up high enough, your unit may not even kick on at all while you are away, which makes turning up vs turning off 6 of one, half a dozen the other.

Overall, though, if you really care about power consumption you will want better insulation, a more efficient unit, and a smart device."

IsItBullshit,fdfewzw,t3_ekxgdg,1578360090.0,"Some US colleges offer credits for scoring well on AP tests.

I entered college with 28 credits. Had it not been for a huge depressive episode where I failed some classes junior year, I would have graduated an entire year early without even having to ""overload"" on coursework (which requires approval from the dean or something). I still managed to finish a semester early, though.

That said, there are a few asterisks to take into consideration when taking AP credit. The first thing is it can hurt your GPA, since it locks you out of some low level courses you are familiar with. My sister qualified for almost as many AP credits as I did. She decided to reject the credit and retake those courses, which was a strong first step toward her ultimately becoming valedictorian. 

Additionally, you still have to get the requirements for your degree. In my case, I think I got 2 truly elective courses (in accounting) off the beaten path for my major and ""core"" requirements. None of the AP credit I got for physics, chemistry, and German really applied to a degree in computer science. Calculus helped, at least.

Overall, it really depends what you are looking for from college. If you just want to rush it and get your degree as quickly and cheaply as possible, go balls in on AP credit. (It's also worth pointing out that grinding AP coursework is likely to get you more attention for scholarships)

If you want to ""experience"" college, AP credit may not be for you. In addition to narrowing the funnel to your major, it can also reduce how much you connect with your class on a social level. People seem to mostly make friends in their first or second semester, so if you spend a lot of time in classes with upperclassmen you may not form as many connections.

tl;dr: if you are paying for your own college, take the AP credit."

The situation basically lands me in a spot where I primarily hang out in subs like unpopularopinion.

Basically, you'll get banned from radical feminist subs for posting in subs critical of radical feminism...

That quantity can deter a small set of travelers from buying. You might find 12 customers willing to pay for 2 bottles at that price faster than you will find 1 customer for 24 (and if that 1 customer comes up they can just buy the lot anyways).

I mostly avoid politics outside this sub. It's still a bit circlejerky, but it's not one of those subs that ban you for posting in other subs so there are at least opportunities to converse with people. I like to watch some political subs without engaging for situational awareness, though.

I do agree the downvote is important. The issue with facebook is the like count has almost no meaning. An awful post on facebook can get a thousand likes if 100 thousand see it and 1% like it. On reddit, the 25K people who dislike can disapprove without commenting.

That all said, I think social media has facilitated the surge in collectivist and authoritarian beliefs that have come out. Individualists, moderates, and apolitical types don't see their political identities as this massive obligatory push to influence the masses, it's herding cats. You can get collectivists and radicals to brigade like hell, though, since they are obsessed with expanding influence and will just upvote/downvote and game the algorithm to put their beliefs in front of everyone. I think one of the biggest mistakes reddit did were the default subs because they wound up filled with this behavior.

It may sound like a great plan, but understand the people in these communities have to drive to work and are already getting what they need at stops on the commute home. That's why it's better to open a store close to a highway exit or high traffic zone instead - you wind up servicing dozens of these communities in a 3-5 mile radius at a bottleneck they all pass through."

AskReddit,fc0745l,t1_fc00su3,1577281404.0,"You have to realize that these residential areas are not close to any of those things. 

I live in Pennsylvania, most neighborhoods outside of the city do not have stores or businesses in or near them. A lot of new developed residential areas are old farms that get bought up and subdivided into as many quarter acres as possible. The only thing in walking distance is the other homes, and odds are you don't know anyone else there. When these areas *do* have sidewalks, they're typically only for joggers and dog walkers, and there is nothing for the sidewalk to connect to outside the neighborhood. Even a lot of older neighborhoods just do not have sidewalks, and there is nothing to walk to. A lot of neighborhoods are even explicitly zoned to exclude shops to reduce traffic.

I live at the edge of a small city of about 100K... I think the sidewalk ends 500-600 yards west of my place. 

Foot traffic is just kind of uncommon outside of areas where cars become impractical."

I know I come off a bit hard on management, but I don't have as many issues with them as it sounds. I'm fairly certain it's one of those deals where if I were to suddenly replace my manager, day one would be a bunch of people in suits sitting me down and giving me info that changes my whole perspective on how the company runs. I at least know things are the way they are for a reason and we can make improvements to the process, but from a realistic perspective there is a bottom line that people have been keeping up for decades.

Even the QA guy I sympathize with a bit. He's mediocre at his actual job, but his work ethic is decent.

A lot of the situation is still inherently frustrating, but I think my influence in the workplace is starting to grow to a point where I might have a chance to improve some things."

AskHR,fbwkl1f,t1_fbvmabe,1577152392.0,"WARNING: This turned into a disorganized rant. Not even sure if it relates to HR anymore, but there were questions I felt like answering.

The company is incredibly dysfunctional and almost unpredictable when it comes to management. I guess you're right that it's not entirely an HR problem I mentioned, but I kind of lumped HR in because I have absolutely no idea what management/HR are up to at any given time. I just know my manager/lead has enough seniority to basically be immune from criticism and that numbers are reported to people who wouldn't have any understanding of what they actually mean. 

Ultimately, the reason I got moved is because my manager gave me a bad review last year since I wasn't picking and choosing work to look good (for example, you get 0 credit for fixing other people's bugs), and he seemingly based most of his review off of some arbitrary numbers he queried. The bad review triggered automatic HR action that required them to put me on some sort of ""improvement plan"", which my manager/boss didn't feel like doing. I think the insulting part was that they were completely unaware of this, which implies they gave the QA guy a satisfactory review. That said, I think they were also aware that I take constructive criticism better than most people.

Meanwhile, in my performance review- which makes up pretty much 75% of the contact I have with my manager in the year- the whole conversation amounted to my manager saying ""you need to start doing X"" and me saying ""I've been doing X for 6+ months"" a few times.

Anyways, they found a loophole to put me somewhere else so they didn't have to retrain me. 

Right before I got shifted, they started actually tracking bugs and found out that I both made the fewest and fixed the most bugs in pretty much any given span of time. Additionally, I was becoming somewhat of a de facto leader when some senior/lead devs left, and I really wanted to keep the QA guy from trying to run the show. People seemed ok with me running meetings so I just sort of ran with it.

Speaking of that QA guy... One big issue in the company is that there seems to always be some issue where we aren't allowed to hire new people. Vacancies go for years without being filled. Basically, the choice is whether we keep a guy doing a lousy job, or we have nobody doing it at all. To put things in perspective, a guy didn't show up for work for several weeks before he got fired, and his position is approaching 3 years of being unfilled.

Anyways, now I'm in a different project and the more individual nature of the work I do makes it much more obvious what I am and am not doing. People seem to really like what they see so far.

Meanwhile on the old team, the incompetent QA guy is apparently trying to lead the group and they've released some pretty nasty bugs over the past few months.

As for why I don't leave is twofold:
First of all, I would have to move to have any chance of getting another job in my field in a timely fashion. Software devs may be in demand, but not so much out in the sticks where I belong. The other thing is that I really don't mind what I currently do. It's kind of interesting, and people seem to support what I do.

Tl:dr; I think you may be right on it largely being unrelated to HR, except for the improvement plan thing."
