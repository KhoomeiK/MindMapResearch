SquaredCircle,ffjscgt,t3_eu050y,1580005630.0,"Vickie was a great heel, she was so good at getting heat despite her circumstances. One of my favorite moments is after she was throwned into the mud by Stephanie McMahon, she attacks her and does the the Eddie wiggle. The pop was so hard, and it was one of the few instances where we truly witness Face Vickie."

SquaredCircle,ffjnclv,t1_ffjfamh,1580002240.0,"Yeah, all belts have velcro now apparently. I understand it's easier for wrestlers, and allows for a possibly better fit, but there's something disheartening and cheap about knowing that the major championship zip with the same materials I used for my shoes when I didn't know how to tie them."

It seems to be the most efficient choice no matter what angle you're looking at, but I still have my doubts whether they would do it. Only because they don't want to seem like piggybacking of off WM.



Now imagine if suddenly AEW announces they'll be holding the episode in the Jaguars stadium."
SquaredCircle,ffjcg05,t1_ffj79y4,1579995370.0,"While a cool idea, they still need to run a Dynamite for the Wednesday during Mania week, and a lot of their midcard talent will probably work some shows during Mania week (particularly Joey Janela)."

SquaredCircle,fffloqy,t1_ffen7e6,1579886657.0,"I like it. But not everyone needs to point. They could try different things while still alluding to WM. One of my favorite moments was between Triple H and The Undertaker where they just stare down at each other and then looked at the wrestlemania sign. Boom, the match was made and it was awesome."
SquaredCircle,fffkzrr,t1_ffem8ik,1579886230.0,"People defend Unity? It's not even that old. It's in the middle and was really bad.

SquaredCircle,ffeea5w,t1_ffcdkdo,1579844791.0,"Yeah, the rules of the draft were stated back on S1. Winner would get the first 3 draft picks if I'm not mistaken. Woods just conviniently forgot. Now he calls himself the King of UUDD, and calls someone else his champion while Breeze holds the belt. He's the true heel."
SquaredCircle,ffe78oc,t1_ffd26o4,1579838572.0,">I think that's due to him going right into the fast and furious movies

I wouldn't say right into, that was basically the second coming of his career. Dwayne distanced himself from his wrestling persona, and that's how he ended up acting in all those family movies. Once he embraced being a wrestler again did he started doing action movies and became the megastar we see today."
SquaredCircle,ffe72oq,t1_ffcxmi6,1579838441.0,"In part is because his rise to fame back when he started being labeled as ""franchise steroids"" was after he embraced his wrestling persona again, after denying it for a lot of years. To some, he'll always be Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, but now Dwayne seems okay with that being part of his legacy."

SquaredCircle,ffb383v,t1_ffb03qh,1579750647.0,"Yeah honestly I don't want them to do the show on cruise on the Cruise next year. Scenery wise it looked awesome, but the constant censoring of the show killed a few moments for me. It's a crowd full of drunk people so I don't think they can figure out a way to stop them either."
SquaredCircle,ffb2sda,t1_ffb1nnu,1579750341.0,"I didn't mind the sound, but rather the chants performed. They were cursing so it got heavily censored, which made for an awkward viewing experience."

SquaredCircle,ff88l39,t1_ff7lf5w,1579669153.0,"Weird that out of six matches taped, they went with 2 and 4 for each episode instead of 3 and 3. Especially since I'm guessing Dark Order and Sabian matches are going to be squashes and the Table match and Fenix could main event an episode."

Also, I was surprised to see that Marko and El Lindaman were basically the same height, yet I didn't notice before, nor have seen any complaints about him not being believable. I guess it's because he's jacked. I love Marko, but he could use some muscle, at least so they don't keep him in the rag dolled spot of tag team matches."

However, I expect Dark (or at least Dark as we know it) to leave YT eventually when it moves to TNT. If Dark is on TV then they wouldn't give the show away on YT anyway, so this is the best next thing.

Maybe they'll get a deal with ITV to also show Dark, that remains to be seen."

I think Nielsen also has social engagement metrics, so as long as you're tweeting/reacting on the internet, and they are able to point to you being on the US, then It will count towards the rating.
