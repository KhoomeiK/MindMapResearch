depression,fe2pk9p,t3_engd6e,1578841508.0,"I've been hesitant to watch. I don't know how I'll take it, in the state that I'm currently in"
depression,fdzh8ov,t3_en2qbu,1578790216.0,"I'm stuck in this point, as well. I have no... goal. No purpose. Existing doesn't seem like enough but that just feels like that's all there is. I try to enjoy things, but it's more forced than true enjoyment. Video games, reading, tv shows, the like... I like doing those things, but I have nothing that I actually ENJOY. And that's where I'm at. A sense of nothingness."
depression,fdx4ftq,t3_en7336,1578765229.0,"Ok, so I'm not trippin when I feel this way (granted, obviously not a healthy thought) but still... I definitely understand this. I'm getting help right and at the same time I think... should I even bother?"
depression,fdqmj9q,t3_emnl5m,1578670203.0,"This hits so close to home, it ain't even funny. I've wished for literally anything but this goddamn mental struggle"
depression,fdawvsl,t1_fd9wtu4,1578251325.0,"I'm horrified of that scenario. Did they at least be amicable, or did she abandon you because she couldn't deal? I'm sorry you've ever had to experience that, as well"
depression,fd9vo3w,t3_ekby0j,1578238620.0,"One of my biggest fears, for my girlfriend to be done with me because of my inability to do things because of my depression. I'm so sorry you're going thru this."

MortalKombat,fciewea,t3_eh68ip,1577661504.0,"That fight was incredibly satisfying. That Kabal combo into the fatal blow dropped my jaw, but you gave as much as you took in round 3. Plus, it's nice to see someone play with Frost and not nerf moves with her."
