TravelHacks,fdmd29b,t1_fdmcnui,1578546021.0,Thank you! I will. I called the Seattle store and they don’t carry the one I want so I’m just gonna order it from the Canadian supplier and return it if I don’t like it. But I’m pretty confident I will like it haha.
TravelHacks,fdm85if,t1_fdlxk8d,1578542174.0,I would be taking the ferry. But thanks. I got it all figured out. I do appreciate your reply though!!:)
AskMen,fdivwrj,t3_elacu8,1578452236.0,I’m 6’3/4” and I Always say I’m 6’1. 3/4” you fucking kidding me? Saying that would just seem insecure. Or like when you ask a little kid how old they are and they say 5 and a half! Like it matters. 6’1 is better imo and it’s only 1/4” away from the truth.
