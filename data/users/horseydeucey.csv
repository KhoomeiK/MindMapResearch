Or did you sign one of those NDA's where you can hint at things, play 'hot or cold,' or pantomime them... as long as you don't say a particular string of specific words?  
Because those don't exist."

I'm generally a cynical fella, but if you have evidence to back up that claim, I'd love to see it."

But this new information isn't helping.  
Did Shahlai ""have to die because he was a bad man"" like Soleimani? If so, can the 'bad men' of the world expect drone strikes courtesy of the U.S. any time, anywhere? And if ""threat-immenence"" is a qualifying factor for drone strikes, why not target the Mexican drug cartels, or Kim?  
I think Trump has gotten away with the Soleimani assassination, in large part because we thought it was a singular event.  
But now we find out there were multiple, concurrent operations in two different countries against Iranian officials? I'm not asking if we can get away with it (because we did... except it sounds like Shahlai got away, too). I'm asking if this is right.  
And how do these actions jibe with Reagan's EO 12333? (No person employed by or acting on the behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination).  
Has this EO been superseded? Have the lawyers reinterpreted it?"

Congress authorizes War (yes, even 'war'). That's the long and short of it."

Not, Sanders tweeted, ""I wouldn't pull troops out of Iraq.""
