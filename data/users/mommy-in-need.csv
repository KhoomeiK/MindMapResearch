depression,ff4bvdn,t3_ererwo,1579559969.0,"This is my life. My only joy is going to bed at night because nothing is expected of me. I can surrender to the non-stop exhaustion. No excruciating work, no fake smiles, no pretending I don't wish I was dead. If I didn't have a child, (like I'm any kind of mother in this condition), I would walk right out into traffic. Multiple shrinks and a plethora of meds haven't fixed me. I'm scared nothing ever will."
