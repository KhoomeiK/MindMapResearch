Don't say 'I'm too hard working, or something made up like that. Think of an actual weakness you have, then explain how you have worked to deal with that. For example, I usually say that I can get overwhelmed by juggling many tasks, but as a result of this I have become great at planning and constantly revising my to-do list to deal with new and unexpected tasks."

There is a blatant disregard for transparency and the people's right to know what is going on. It is certainly a problem of Boris Johnson, but as I see it, it is part of a slow and global trend toward populism and decreasing democracy in many countries in the EU and beyond."
