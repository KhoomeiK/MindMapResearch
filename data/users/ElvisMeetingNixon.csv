But if you really think other crimes aren't associated with these things, you're an idiot. Why do you think most women are becoming prostitutes? It wasn't just because things weren't working out down at the Waffle House. It's because they need money to feed addictions. These women who are sometimes the sole providers to children are putting themselves in dangerous situations and cheating their children out of parents. Yes, heroin and meth addicts should have a ""right"" to do heroin and meth. But what happens when they're constantly overdosing without insurance and costing the time and money of EMTs and firemen who respond? What happens when they need more money to feed their addictions? They turn to begging and petty crime, which ruins already poor and working class neighborhoods. This is what I don't get about things labeled as ""progressive,"" like prostitution and drug use being legal; the root of the word is progress. Who are we trying to make progress in regards to? For the junkie who refuses help for years or the people trying to make a go at life the proper way who are having their neighborhoods ruined by addiction and vagrancy."

Not every asshole, but I’ve noticed it happen. I don’t drink at work and assholes often are so used to receiving the abuse back that they really can’t process when I just stand there and make them explain the things they’re saying.

If you choose to replace your drinking with exercising and clean eating, good for you. Seriously.
