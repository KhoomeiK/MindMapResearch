instantpot,fehhng9,t1_feflgfq,1579116727.0,Just proteins to be honest...I hadn’t considered supplements. I’d like simple recipes i can make that wont spoil too quickly but i do want to be cognizant of making sure Holland gets all the vitamins he needs. Have you considered anything?
blackladies,fehhhrw,t1_fegzor2,1579116635.0,"I can relate. She’s been adamant about not going to talk to someone; however, expressed interest once in trying online counseling. She’s not exactly internet savvy so i was very skeptical it would take; however, i was eager to jump on the opening. Paid for a monthly program and ended up losing the money because she didn’t like that  the counselor didn’t respond right away. I can tell she’s burdened because it overflows whenever she starts talking about well pretty much anything these days. I’ve had to distance myself on and off for my health and sanity as well...always get pulled back in because of guilt and the fear of her being so lonely."
blackladies,fehgwlg,t1_fecul5d,1579116292.0,"Not anyone she would listen to or trust for that matter. She says going to church is her therapy and that’s all well and good but if you have a broken leg, most are not going to church for it to heal. Behavioral health is no different than a real medical issue.  I’ve tried explaining it that way and it was a no go."

BlackHair,fdcdhcp,t1_fdc23xw,1578272233.0,"First and foremost, “super Saiyan hair” is probably one of the best/interesting compliments I’ve heard and I lived in Japan for 2 years. Kind of jealous LOL

Secondly, I thoroughly enjoyed reading your responses to the forceful nature of the other comments. Too often we (the royal we on the internet) dissolve into name calling and pettiness. I completely agree how the opinions of others in our own community can cage us. There’s so much anger these days; there’s no room for any attempt at understanding."
BlackHair,fda3gmr,t3_ek7mv0,1578241220.0,Meh; if they ask first I’m ok with it. To understand you must first be educated so I take the opportunity to explain hair differences. “It’s so weird” though was unacceptable
