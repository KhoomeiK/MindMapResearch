 I spent nearly a year in the South Pacific and whilst in some places you wade ashore through plastic bags and all kinds of shit (Honiara on Guadalcanal for example where even the streams and ditches are choked with it, like landfill), other places are definitely make and mend with zero waste but their quality of life is pretty poor.
It's actually made worse for them because they are aware of what the developed world has and, understandably they want it too.

To bring all these people up to a level where they feel they are satisfied and have a ""modern"" life is a ticking time bomb for waste and pollution because their wants will be satisfied before the infrastructure to handle the fallout is in place.
I can only see the pollution in the Pacific getting worse for decades as China, especially, pushes more of its cheap output into the Islands.

This involved a cross country walk and just as I was just getting close to an underpass I had to go under the world started spinning and everything went multicoloured, like looking through a kaleidoscope, red and green with yellow and black flashes. I knew I was going down; couldn't breath, sweat pouring off me, heart going like a hammer, roaring in my ears, vision closing in.

I thought, this is it, this is how I die. I hit the ground and remember putting myself into the recovery position thinking that's all I can give myself. Then blacked out.

I came too, I don't know how long later. Could have been fifteen minutes, could have been three hours. I'd nearly bitten through the side of my tongue and my back and legs felt like I'd been on the rack so I'd obviously had a seizure whilst unconscious. It scared the f... out of me because I was obviously in a shit state coming round and being alone, covered in mud and barely able to walk. I was actually afraid of someone coming along and seeing me like that, the shame of being seen to be a wreck of a human being really filled me with fear. I must have looked like a walking corpse but I lived.

Years later I had to have an MRI scan and the doctor asked me if I had ever had a seizure. She showed me a black blob on my brain scan (quite interesting to see your own brain actually). Some part of my brain had burst or bled and the damage is still there. 

As another poster had commented, it's the getting close to death that is scary and realising the absolute fuck up you've made letting everyone who you love down. I actually didn't care about myself at that point but the guilt just before you go under, knowing that you might not come out is heart rending."
