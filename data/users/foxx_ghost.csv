childfree,fffvp43,t1_fffun7j,1579892823.0,"I’ve started blasting music in the bathroom of my unit, the bathroom is the thinnest of the walls. Sometimes I’ll feel like they’re in there with me. So I started blasting all kinds of music, aggressively heavy rock, to metal, if I get to hear their horrible child SCREAMING at 1 am. They can suffer through my loud music at 6 am because I need to keep myself awake. One day I went into the bathroom yelled “I wish that damn kid would shut the hell up” 
I did all this after calmly talking to both parents, saying how it’s effecting my sleep and they said other units have mentioned it too. They both look really sorry and embarrassed. 
It got better for a day or so. 

I even asked my own mother if screaming like this is “normal” for a kid who is 3-4 she said I never did anything like that."
