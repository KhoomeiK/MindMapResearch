scifi,ff1tmr6,t3_eqzstw,1579485910.0,If you look into any artist pre 1980 they were all pretty shitty and I don't think much has changed. But yeah Asimov was an asshole and not just for the stuff with women. But i do like his irobot trilogy. Lovecraft was a huge racist but I do like mountain of madness and the quatermass movies BBC did in the 6os and 70s based on his stuff. I've been thinking recently that every fan will forgive their favorite artists for doing terrible things but if they are indifferent to the artist then they want their head on a stick. A modern version of this is i think time cruise is batshit crazy and one of 2 heads of a horrific cult. (Well its a religion because the leader died and it continued which really is the only difference embetween a religion and a cult) but when he has a new mission impossible or damn near any other movie ( jack reacher 2 was weak) coming out ill end up seeing it in theaters because 9 times out of 10 they are the great. My dad hates woody allen but really likes his movies.

Im a 33 year old white guy but I'm really just a nerd and i live in a mostly black neighborhood but the kids costumes at halloween was eye opening. After that new power rangers movie every little bro was dressed up like the blue ranger, then it was Anthony Mackie as falcon, and then it was tchalla. When i was a kid I always thought comic book super heroes transcended race, sex, creed, religion... But the majority of them are white. Representation is important. Jon Stewart for life... Also any nerd parents with nerdy kids check out static shock... Also no one ever told me growing up how much brothers love dragonballz. Nerd recognizes nerd."
