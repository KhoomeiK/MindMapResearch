Saddam once gassed one of his own towns because he thought they were conspiring against him, and 5000 people died with another 10000 injured. Of his own people. And the US invaded because the government was apparently linked to terrorists and developing weapons of mass destruction. And yeah, it seems like those were mostly lies but still, Iraq was a mess and in a way i respect the US for trying to clean it up, but idk"
TeenAmIUgly,fcycs2k,t3_ejjjqq,1578078164.0,"You legitimately don't look that bad lol, 5/10. Maybe try to smile more, and your neck is a bit long but that's the only thing i can find tbh"
teenagerpolitics,fcxwjn7,t1_fcxw042,1578071487.0,"Yup, like i said before it seems like barely any 'normal' people run for any important political roles and it's pretty sad"
teenagerpolitics,fcxw1u8,t1_fcxvkuy,1578071326.0,"Well you can hope lol. And yeah you'll definitely do some good. Maybe start small at city council or something, I'm sure you'll be popular as a veteran, then work your way up i guess. Good luck!"
teenagerpolitics,fcxvha6,t1_fcxukwg,1578071085.0,"Ya know I reckon you'd make a really good politician judging from the way you act, not even joking lol"
teenagerpolitics,fcxvcfl,t1_fcxukwg,1578071001.0,"I think most democrats are trying to 'ease in slowly' without radical concepts to the stereotypical Southern republican, for instance equality, acceptance of LGBTQA+ people and not treating people like shit for things they either can't control or have no reason to control in the first place. Ya know, mad stuff. I'm sure you'll eventually get a president who isn't a straight white male, just unfortunately there are still those who aren't ready i guess. But no judgement obviously, there are racist ignorant idiots everywhere ngl"
teenagerpolitics,fcxu2mi,t1_fcxtw4r,1578070495.0,"I've got my money on Pete Buttigieg tbh, he seems pretty good to me at least"
teenagerpolitics,fcxtnyf,t1_fcxskhu,1578070250.0,"Yeah that's what it seems like nowadays, it's really sad. Like, the UK parliament is literally a joke (i won't even include examples just look up any video, it's insanity). The US senate is at least calmer from what i know at least, but the election runs are just crazy to watch ngl. People should vote for you because they agree with your views, and not even necessarily that, at least you think they'll help create a better country for not only you but for people in general, both in your country and out. People shouldn't vote for you cos you're good at roasting people ffs, it's crazy to me lol

Also this is probably just me but does it seem like most politicians are a bit insane, i legit can't think of any politicians that seem.... normal. It's like the majority of people in the world could do a better job than those who actually end up trying to get elected. Weird :/"
teenagerpolitics,fcxs7fb,t1_fcxquvr,1578069642.0,"That's actually a very good point, i didn't think about that. Even if America is relatively stable now there is absolutely no guarantee that will last and as you say the Hong Kong protests are a great example of that. Also the civil war in Libya is a similar thing, there's loads of rebels who started with literally nothing against a well equipped army, they fought with harpoon guns and kitchen knives and still do, the only guns they have are looted from the soldiers that they manage to get. 

So yeah, you have yourself a new supporter i guess lol :) though I'm still a bit skeptical about guns falling into the wrong hands but oh well, no systems perfect"
teenagerpolitics,fcxqaz4,t3_ej1mzu,1578068922.0,"The thing is tho, the entire argument behind people arming themselves to protect from other armed people seems really fucking stupid. The only reason people are armed is to protect from... other armed people?? You do realise that you could have just never legalised firearms without proper training/reasons, and this entire gun control situation never would have happened

And yes i realise there are a lot of flaws with this argument, ofc the second amendment was made law in 1791 so it's not like it's because of this generation kinda, but it seems like a dumb outdated idea in the first place tbh. And another flaw is that there will always be guns that illegally enter countries and are used by terrorists, criminals or any kind of other person who might get a gun, idk really etc, and that's a obviously huge problem in virtually every modern country. You either arm civilians or basically run a police state to keep civilians safe, and to me they both seem shit. But the police system works fine... granted, sometimes it takes time for police to be dispatched to a location, which is not ideal, but really...

I mean look at the London bridge terror attack that happened recently in the UK. Until the police arrived nobody had firearms, but people attacked the terrorist with a frickin narwhal tusk pulled from a nearby restaurant and it worked fine lmao. So i just don't get it.. it seems like the cons hugely outweigh the pros but I'm probably missing some stuff, so correct me if I'm wrong"
teenagerpolitics,fcxp2dh,t3_ejgwwq,1578068147.0,"Yeah this is totally fucked ngl. Idk what trump was thinking when he ordered the strike (without any authorization from literally anywhere btw). Yes, the general was a piece of shit and kinda had it coming, but why would you do this now, while there are huge tensions between the middle east and the west? The people of Iran live in an oppressive regime that has been openly hostile towards Western countries such as the US before with barely any provocation as far as i understand it, so it seems like a silly idea to me tbh. 

Also, fun fact, the Iraqi parliamentary leader was also killed in the blast as he was visiting for some reason, which is a huuuuge violation of the terms Iraq set out for the US fighting in their country. Actually, now Iraq is pushing for thousands of US troops to leave and some Iraqi politicians are now denouncing the strike, especially because the US probably knew about the parliamentary leader visiting

But yeah, that's just my view on things, and I'm not the most well informed person in the world so apologies if i got things wrong. And ik i seem a bit opinionated, I'm just actually terrified about what's going to happen next so sorry about lmao

Anyway, if anybody disagrees/agrees i would love to hear what you all have to say about this :)"
lonely,fcxdu5n,t3_ejamud,1578060281.0,"You're not pathetic at all, you're in a really shitty situation that isn't your fault and you're reacting normally. Trust me :)

You should do what you feel would be the best. Staying in a loveless relationship is painful ofc but if that's what you really need to finish your degree... actually even then i think it's a bad idea. It might feel like you're losing out but you still have time lmao, and breaking up with your bf and i think trying to maybe even distance yourself from your family would be what i would try

I'm so sorry, this isn't helpful at all. I really hope this clears up for you soon tho :) good luck with whatever route you choose

Btw on reading it again, you should absolutely break up with your bf, he's a piece of shit. Don't believe what he says, promise me, things will get better. I know people say that a lot and it sounds like bs. But seriously, the situation you're trapped it is fixable, just take the steps to do it. We'll all be here to support you if you need it :) good luck"
lonely,fcxdej5,t3_ej7hio,1578059927.0,"Congrats OP!! Seriously this is a great thing, I'm really glad. Happy new year!"
lonely,fcxd7r8,t3_ejcfb7,1578059772.0,"Hey OP, I'm really sorry that you're in this crappy situation. I think you did make a bit of a mistake but literally everybody does now and then, it's not remotely your fault honestly. From what i can tell, your bf was abusive and most probably manipulative and got you to abandon college, something important in your life, just for him, which is ofc a shitty move to pull.

If you want advice, i would firstly recommend contacting a professional, probably a psychiatrist. Depending on where you live this can be easy or hard, and if your financial situation isn't great then you might have some trouble, but there are options, free online services and phone lines if you think you could manage something like that

And as for getting out of loneliness, well that's difficult, especially when you have depression. You might be able to think of ways to meet people but you have no motivation to do them, or at least that's how i feel. So the hard part is keeping hope that you will eventually get people. You seem like a really nice person and I'm sure you won't have any problem finding people who will like you so try not to worry and keep motivation. You know there are literally tens of thousands of people in a similar situation, and you're just one of them. You're not whatever your mind tells you that you are, cos depression lies to you, seriously. You have to learn not to trust yourself in a way and that's really horrible, i know it's hard for me but don't lose hope OP, you'll get through this.

If you're struggling for ideas, i would recommend joining a club. There's a million things you could do, maybe cooking, maybe reading, maybe just trying to find like minded people who enjoy things that you enjoy or at least share interests with you. That's the way that everybody meets people for most of their lives, and no matter what you think, it is the same for you, you have the same chance and the same opportunities. I promise you :)

Yeah i might have gone a bit overboard lol sorry, but it really applies, i hate seeing people suffer like this

Happy new year! I know that this year is gonna be a good one, trust me :)"
lonely,fcxcbj8,t3_ejdv3s,1578059015.0,"Happens to me all the time lol, once i got a text and i was really happy, then i realised it was the post office telling me that a package has been rerouted. Twice. Then i got another one and it was EE telling me i ran out of data. So yeah that really sucks lol. 

You shouldn't lose hope though, judging from how you thought someone texted you, there are clearly people who are willing to text to and you at least have some relationship with, so I'd try starting some convos with them :) it can be terrifying a lot of the time, but trust me no matter how worthless or awkward you feel, you do deserve friends. Everybody does and you seem pretty nice, so yeah. If you want then seeing as it's the new year then you could try texting people happy new year, asking them if they have any new years resolutions and maybe a conversation will naturally come up, just persevere with it. Trust me I'm literally in the situation you are in right now, but it's not too late for you, and you should definitely give it a go, just try your hardest, cos that's all you can do.

Happy new year btw! I hope your year gets better, really :)"
teenagerpolitics,fcxbriq,t1_fcxbj4b,1578058536.0,"Yea, for England it's literally just the US name with royal before it. Royal marines, royal navy, royal air force etc. Cos i guess the Queen is still a thing (even though she literally has no power or control over anything at all, she just eats like a hundred million quid of tax payer money so yeah. England's soooo great :) )"
teenagerpolitics,fcxbhwk,t1_fcxbg1w,1578058297.0,It's the RAF (royal air force) and I'm 14 so I'm not sure that would go down too well....

teenagerpolitics,fcxarsz,t1_fcxa4zt,1578057643.0,"Fair enough, and there would definitely be some benefits to the strike if Iran wasn't the country that it was tbh. They've been openly extremely hostile to the west before with not much provocation, and the people of Iran are governed under a brutal regime that is currently technically in a state of peace, granted, but nevertheless it was extremely volatile in the first place, and this sort of violent response seems like it may have severe consequences not only for Iraq and Iran and the middle east in general, but also the West. 

Not only that, but the strike also killed the Iraq parliamentary leader, which is a huge breach of the Iraq mandate for the US. They're meant to fight Islamic state in Iraq, not Iraq itself and this killing has already sparked anger from Iraqi officials, and Iraq is actually pushing 5000 US troops to leave Iraq now, and this combined with the obvious Iran hostility seems like a terrible combo to me at least"
teenagerpolitics,fcx9zoz,t3_eje78n,1578056899.0,"Well that could be a good idea but realistically keeping every single politician in check (or at least at the federal level, not local city councils and stuff) would take up a massive amount of personnel and resources so it's not very practical imo

And let's be honest most high ranking politicians are probably under surveillance by the CIA or NSA or maybe even the DoD already, just in case they become a threat to national security or something like that, as you say they can be damn powerful, like trump ordering the airstrike on the Iranian guy, like bruh... what was going through your head when you thought ""you know what will be a good idea? assasinating the second most major Iranian politician cuz.... reasons"" 

But yeah it's a good idea if we could i guess :)"
teenagerpolitics,fcvvo84,t3_ej0knj,1578011145.0,"I saw your post on r/teenagers and tbh this sub seems like a really good idea and it's a real shame it's been inactive recently, but you still need to prepare for the inevitable sh*tposters who are gonna come here and make communism jokes"
teenagers,fcvriy8,t1_fcvr6us,1578008472.0,"Exactly, it's really annoying for me when you're told to grow up and be independent and just act like an adult, but the same people still act like you're a kid and don't let you do what they want you to do...... like wat. But hey, i guess being a teenager just sucks like that huh"
AmItheAsshole,fcvpz1i,t3_eizz56,1578007475.0,"YTA
This is massively fucked up, especially effectively insulting a kid for having a mental illness that you clearly have an extremely basic understanding of. Calling social anxiety ""being antisocial"" is like calling cancer ""having your hair fall out"". It's incredibly ignorant and disrespectful in so many ways. I mean.. i can't even. Other commenters have explained this way better than i ever could lmao, but i just feel like i have to add this for the bot. Just.... seriously, this is really bad. 


Apologise to your sister for being a complete bitch and insulting her child, and if she doesn't accept your apology, that's not surprising. You've majorly fucked up"

I guess if you want you could try starting a skincare kind of thing to feel better but hey, you're a teenager and trust me even if it doesn't seem like it, there are pretty much no teenagers who are actually secure about their appearance, even ones who look fine like yourself.

teenagers,fc3vi8v,t3_eg1x42,1577399691.0,"Hi there
I am so sorry this has happened to you, nobody deserves to have things like that happen to them. I personally used to have a dad who was a really crappy person, and he hit our family dog a lot. It made me feel like shit that i couldn't do anything. He's out of the house now and my dog is getting on great

Also, my mum's a cop in England, and idk where you live but i actually asked her and she said it's really unlikely that animal control services would take the dog away unless it could be proved that even without your stepdad not hurting it, it would be dangerous. I'm really not sure, but I'd suggest looking up animal control policy in your area, and hopefully you'll get the info you need.

Again I'm so sorry this is happening, and i really hope that this gets solved :)"
