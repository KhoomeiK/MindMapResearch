selfimprovement,ff5jfcf,t3_erp72h,1579595695.0,"I was in a very similar situation here at 29 also other than I'm with parents again after a relationship split. I learned to drive and failed my test but almost there! I also hit the gym and sorted my diet accordingly. If you're consistent with the gym, you won't want to ruin it with drinking and poor sleep so the benefits really do run deep. Just remember that this is quite a bit to take on at once so don't stress if you stumble. Pick yourself up and go again. Embrace the struggle as it'll make you feel alive again. Best of luck my friend."

penpals,fer9tio,t3_emeh5w,1579351530.0,"Hey!

29/Male/UK (specifically North West England) with a deep sense of wanderlust and the intention of road-tripping round the states in my thirties.

I'm from a grey industrial town but I try and find beauty in everything on a daily basis and I abandoned negative thought patterns last year. I think life is a somewhat crazy, magical ride and the more we can engage with the present and roll with the good and the bad, the more we can enjoy that ride.

I used to play a lot of video games but more recently that's been replaced with books, hikes, working out and drinking coffee. I'm also into craft beer and I can make some pretty good cocktails. Do I sound hipster enough yet?

Also currently cycling a tropical fish tank ready for either a betta or some shrimpies. Will decide a bit further down the line but I'm excited for either. I have had coldwater fish in the past but I am far more knowledgeable now. I do also love dogs and hope to have one once I have settled down in a home with a big enough garden to let one loose in.

I like a bit of history and mythology. The area I come from isn't far from some seriously amazing, very old and very enchanting places and I would be thrilled to share my experience of these places. I already talk to some people stateside via discord and love to wax lyrical about how beautiful my country is when you peel back the layers.

Finally, I definitely want to snail mail as I have a lovely new fountain pen and I'm trying to work on my handwriting. I also like the idea of the wait and anticipation for receiving mail.

Feel free to reply or shoot me a message. Have a good one!"
selfimprovement,feetute,t1_fed9nwf,1579041088.0,30 in July. Also screwed up a major relationship last year. Also stopped gaming and found new hobbies. Also hit the gym. Hello friend! Ha
bettafish,fdlqp1e,t1_fdkviku,1578530211.0,Other side of the proverbial pond but thank you for the offer friend!
bettafish,fdlqlb0,t1_fdktige,1578530139.0,Yes. I don't have any friends who keep fish to my knowledge but I'll try the stores when I'm shopping for bits! It did already cross my mind.Thanks
bettafish,fdlqgsy,t1_fdksbe6,1578530054.0,Really appreciate this. I am aware of a few places locally which have the frozen foods although I'm not sure of their brand. The rooibos tea is an easy one. I'll get some tomorrow. Stressguard should be available on Amazon if not nearby so I'll get some of that too as I fear he's been through the wars recently. Thanks and enjoy the rest of your week.
bettafish,fdkxzbv,t3_elwi0k,1578513470.0,"Wow. Thanks so much for all of the extra info. I should add that I live in the UK and we have stricter laws on the sale of fish here, I believe (no tiny cups. Goldfish banned as funfair prizes etc). To be honest, I have already spent much more than I could actually afford on the little guy (again, believing it to be a less expensive fish to take care of) but I feel somewhat indebted to the little fella. Rooibos tea is easy to get hold of here and I happen to like it so I'll go grab some of that. The fasting I already know about but the food recommendations will be very useful. I've already got him some frozen bloodworm treats as a protein source as I know these dudes eat bugs. I'm watching the tank like a hawk when I can. On a personal level this is making me grow and I'm very glad to join an awesome community. I look forward to giving positive updates. My friend is so inquisitive and seems to love his new home already. Thank you all."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcyarn3,t3_ejbmul,1578077293.0,"Deal breaker. Keep them both blocked and continue moving forward, as you say. I find with this sort of situation, the worse the pain is, the stronger the version of yourself you'll find on the other side. Best of luck my friend."
