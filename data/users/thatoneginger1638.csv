raisedbynarcissists,ffb3bls,t3_esj7i0,1579750715.0,You did a really brave thing. You wouldn't have made this choice if you didnt have a good reason. You are not responsible for your mothers feelings. Let her feel what she needs to. Focus on you. You are free. I know you're feeling a lot right now but just take it one step at a time. Its okay to be confused and stressed. Just remember that you made the right choice and for good reasons. You are supported here. You can do this!

Please update if he does anything, he sounds like a piece of work."
Anxiety,ff3bocd,t3_ere28v,1579538008.0,"Something similar happened to my partner. He was in between jobs for 3 months and then when he started his new job (which he really enjoys) he, very suddenly, became a nervous wreck. He was in tears before almost every shift. For no particular reason. He saw his GP and got a low dose anti anxiety medication. It appears to have helped, though I still think it would be beneficial for him to talk to a therapist but he wont make an appointment. His anxiety is abated by the medication so I dont press the issue. 
No idea what happened. Still not sure. Good luck. Just try to be patient and talk him through it when it's at its worst. Anxiety can be a monster to deal with and can really affect your life, if it gets worse, suggest he go to his doctor to talk to SOMEONE about what's happening."

relationships,fdyd8rd,t3_ena2pl,1578778514.0,"Dont do it. I dont think you will ever really forgive her, especially since hair can be weird and not grow back the same way. She is doing this because she wants to have power. That's really terrible, I'm really sorry. Disinviting you from her wedding is shallow and immature. I understand her wanting to have a uniform bridal party, disallowing that is brutal enough, but it's her day. Disinviting you completely....over something she KNOWS matters to you, is just tragic. I'm so sorry, but please, dont cut your hair."
AmItheAsshole,fdr7aps,t3_emr755,1578680501.0,"NTA- my friend has 2 kids from a failed iud w/ failed condom and the other from failed pill w/ failed condom. It's rare enough that you should still use protection but it happens. Even if it was 100% his, it's still your body and you get the final say"
NoStupidQuestions,fdnrmf9,t1_fdnrbgt,1578591452.0,They arent actually flushable but it's good you dont have a septic tank because if those fuck up your septic a lot of times insurance policies wont cover it. Get like a diaper genie or something.

TwoXChromosomes,fdltnbs,t3_eluwox,1578532222.0,"You should absolutely report your GP. That was wildly unprofessional. I'm serious, even if nothing initially comes of it, it will be noted and if it happens again there will be a trail. I'm sorry your doc was an ass and, obviously, an ill informed idiot"
LifeProTips,fdkh2sa,t1_fdjva0v,1578503731.0,"You're right. That is very true. Kids are inconsistent but I think the main point is that they should not be ignored or forced to be close with someone they are uncomfortable with. You are also right in the fact that a lot of people can be in close relationships with their abusers.  
I'm sorry for what you went through with your cousin. I know I'm sorry's dont change what happened but that's horrible. 
I think the takeaway should be dont invalidate your child's fears but dont assume every person or thing your child is afraid of wary of is a monster, just be vigilant."
LifeProTips,fdjagqt,t1_fdiuwwm,1578463244.0,"I think that's a valid point but you should never just dismiss a kids words because ""you know better"". Either be more vigilant or ask follow up questions, ""why dont you want to be around so and so?"" Usually kids can articulate when given the opportunity.  If the answer is ""his beard is scary"" then okay you know your child doesnt like beards. If the answer is ""his beard is scratchy on my privates"" then something is amiss"
AmItheAsshole,fdfyntr,t3_ekvy1l,1578373932.0,I would've blocked him in. Had it towed when I saw the notes.  Called him and been like pick it up from x impound lot because you're a prick. He should not have parked in your driveway. He has NO right to be short or rude to you. NTA

confessions,fdewdha,t3_ekzrqr,1578347980.0,"You loved and cared for that little girl, even though you didnt want to. You were a good dad. Her life was cut short, which is always tragic, but now you get to do what you WANT to do. It's okay to feel some kind of relief, even happiness. You already grieved. Her memory is in no way tarnished by you being happy. Be happy. Live your life the way you want to. If you had somehow contributed to her death deliberately, itd be different. You stepped up when you really did not have to, you're a good guy."
JUSTNOMIL,fdb1pi5,t3_ekd2zg,1578252704.0,"She did not deserve grace and composure. It does not matter the stories she will tell, you know the truth. You were right. You are protecting your daughter. This wont give her a path back to you. We are with you."
morbidquestions,fdauzp9,t3_ek7kes,1578250541.0,"Even in the US getting away with things like kidnap, rape, and murder are fairly easy if you pick the right place. Distrust of law enforcement and lack of awareness is a huge factor. Hundreds of missing black girls are never reported or, if they are, taken seriously. Its unfortunate but can really happen anywhere."
confessions,fda6t8v,t3_ekbd1m,1578242396.0,The government doesnt represent all US people either. Most of us do not want to go to war. I think the memes are a way of coping but also a way to show teenagers and other people who may not pay attention to world news that bad things are happening
TwoXChromosomes,fd5qpjt,t3_ejyuic,1578180412.0,"Hey sweetheart, I know you feel all kinds of guilt and shame, that's totally normal, but really unnecessary. I know that this is painful and difficult, and unimaginably lonely but you are not alone. You made an extremely difficult decision. You are strong, you are brave, and you are absolutely not alone. Just try and remind yourself that this was the best choice for you right now, regardless of what made it.  I wish I knew you in person, so I could be there to help, but I dont so I cant so all I can do is give you lots of internet hugs."

relationships,fc4h01o,t3_eg156p,1577416393.0,"Tbh, she is probably out of control because of the entire environment. My sister has 3 kids, lives above her moms garage, and her oldest is practically the mom...the youngest is a nightmare. Kids NEED routine and discipline but...from their parents. I dont tolerate ANY of my niblings acting out, they get reprimanded (appropriately). You are not an asshole, frankly, because she isnt your kid. If you were beating the snot out of her then they'd be different but she lacks discipline because her mom cant be bothered. Kids without routine and discipline typically act out, as I'm sure you know. Good luck with saving up, I believe in you!"

confessions,fc3zh08,t1_fc3yj29,1577402640.0,"Yes and no. He tries to understand but, at the end of the day, it really stresses him out so the things he ends up saying come out worse than they're supposed to. I appreciate the sentiment. I hate feeling this way but after 10+ antidepressants and about the same amount of therapists just telling me to ""talk about it"" is exhausting. I do talk about it. I'm very open about my anxiety and depression. I've tried a bunch of CBT techniques and none have really helped. I dont want to feel like this...but its weighing on me"
NoStupidQuestions,fc1sxvb,t3_efn7u5,1577328714.0,"Because, in public school, no one gives a shit. The teachers are paid between 50,000 and 60,000 dollars per year to deal with fucking monsters. And if that kid sucks, imagine his parents?? We except our teachers and administrators to give a fuck about the kids they watch but we dont pay them enough to live, causing many to have multiple jobs so they cant focus on the most important one. But on top of that kids parents are the ABSOLUTE worst. Their kid is an innocent angel and if you say otherwise ""I'll get you fired"". So yeah they literally are not paid enough to care. I quit Target loss prevention because I wasnt getting paid enough to get assaulted every day, I cant imagine how teachers feel.
Edited: fixed the salary and this is from an American stand point in case that was unclear."
