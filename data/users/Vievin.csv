ffxiv,feqx732,t1_feqms9r,1579347100.0,"Basically, you have to collect three different seals for Divination so it dives the biggest damage boost. Ranged/Melee cards vaguely matter, but the bigger thing is the seal, since in content that actually matters, you have 4 DPS and there's bound to be both melee and ranged. Once you have those three seals, you don't want any more seals. So you ""blow"" the cards you get on Minor Arcana, since a MA'd card doesn't generate seals.

A simple flowchart: Do you have three different seals? If yes, turn all subsequent cards into Minor Arcana until Divination comes up. If no, redraw until you get the correct card so you have more different seals. If you mess up and get two of the same, remember that Playing a card pushes it to the right side of the ""seal queue"" and pushes the leftmost card off. (You can see the seal the card will generate on the top of the card: Sun, Moon or Full Moon. Full Moon is supposed to be Star or something but I don't buy it.)

WritingPrompts,fe466jz,t3_enkvbn,1578856161.0,"""Dei, I'm afraid,"" Sera whispered as she sat in my lap. She had snuck into my room after our parents tucked us in, after a thorough scolding. *You shouldn't be up this late, you know the rules*, they said, but we never had an official bedtime. They were just mad we listened in to their secret monster hunter meeting. 

Mom and Dad are monster hunters. And we are monsters.

""Dei, I'm a vampire,"" Sera started crying again. I resumed stroking the top of her head, relishing the feeling of her silk-soft blonde hair. ""And you're a werewolf. I checked on the internet and the moon is going to be full next Friday. Mom and Dad are going to find out.""

I froze, looking up at the sky. It was cloudy, but I could see the faint outline of the moon. It looked to be around half-full, making a D shape in the sky. I gulped. I've read up on werewolf lore extensively. Transformation sounded painful, and inevitable.

""Don't worry, Sera,"" I murmured. ""We will... do something."" I wasn't sure what, though. My boyfriend still lived with his parents, and I didn't want to expose him to either of us. I still haven't told him. And any family friends were connected with our parents. We didn't have anywhere to go. Except... But before I could think things through, I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. Gasping, I turned and saw Sera biting at my collarbone. Her eyes were flashing from her own bright blue to a bright red and black. Oh no. *Oh no.* The attack happened two days ago, and Sera hasn't eaten a bit of food since. I knew our parents were starting to ger worried. But she hasn't drunk any blood either. 

""Sera..."" I started apprehensively. ""Are you hungry for blood?"" She flinched a bittle, casting her flickering eyes down. A tiny nod. I bit my lip - not hard enough to draw blood - as I thought. We needed to do something, and we needed to do it *now*. Guess I'm that desperate now, I thought as I fished out a piece of paper from my pocket. There was a nine-digit number on it. I found it on the last night of full moon, after the werewolf attack that had turned me. I didn't know if it was placed beside my body intentionally or if it had just fallen out of his pocket or something, but it was my only clue of their identity. With one hand, the other keeping Sera's now constantly nipping teeth away from my shoulder and neck, I dialed the number.

It picked up on the fourth ring.

""Hello?"" a male voice rang out. It sounded similar enough to the growling I heard as I was mauled that it *could* be the same person. If I had to guesstimate, I would've said he was around thirty or so. 

""It's, ugh, me,"" I said, just as uncertain as the other man was. I drew a deep breath. Sera's eyes were now flickering fast, and I needed help quick. Here's hoping Twilight got the whole ""vampires and werewolves are mortal enemies"" thing wrong. ""You were the one who turned me, right?""

There was a silence on the other side of the line. I could hear my heartbeat as I waited for his answer. It suddenly occurred to me that he could be a monster hunter, same as my parents. I would be *screwed*.

""Do you happen to be a boy around eighteen if I had to spitball, shortish, blonde hair? Was in Tiamat Alley three weeks back? Screams kind of quietly?"" My mouth went dry.

""It's you,"" I breathed into the line. ""I mean, it's me. Yes. My name is Dei. And I need your help."""
