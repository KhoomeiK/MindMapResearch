newborns,ffa8nnq,t1_ffa8hd1,1579730031.0,"Just adding, if you're more than a couple hours drive, you're going to want to stop every 2 hours or so to let yourself and the baby stretch, change the diaper, feed the baby, etc."
newborns,ffa8hd1,t3_esiffo,1579729934.0,"I have a five month old, and when she was 3.5 months, we took her on a road trip. It really depends on how your kid is in the car. If they scream, assume they're gonna scream the whole time. So maybe limit distance in that case. Make sure you have sunscreen and a comfortable place for the baby to nap. Hope this helps and you guys have fun!"
gatekeeping,ff9qi5m,t3_es76xm,1579718742.0,"Thanks for this, made me laugh"
sex,ff9i2rc,t3_esejzf,1579713480.0,"Have you talked to her about how distant you feel? If you feel the need to move on, then do the honorable thing and divorce her. But if you want to try to save it, you need to talk to her."
ChoosingBeggars,ff9g3tn,t3_es600r,1579712274.0,"""would have used the time differently"" is probably code for ""I dicked around making small talk and trying to hit on her, preventing work from getting done."""
sexualhealth,ff9f47w,t3_es6vvg,1579711668.0,"Could be a zit, or an ingrown hair. Might just be a red bump (human skin is weird). My advice? Take a shower and gently clean it, then leave it the hell alone for a few days. Probably goes away all by itself. If it doesn't, or if you're super worried about it, go see a doctor."
garden_maintenance,ff9ejb1,t3_eseb02,1579711303.0,"Could try a sign that says ""Smile, you're on camera."" Even if you don't have a camera, it might curtail pickers"
JUSTNOMIL,ff98hyx,t3_es83fa,1579707289.0,"""Are you calling me a liar?""
""Yes. Want some cake? It's chocolate.""

This put a smile on my face."
TwoXChromosomes,ff97lyk,t3_es9hed,1579706715.0,Can someone please ELI5? How is it a nuisance if there was an actual crime?
JUSTNOMIL,ff1vrm1,t3_er5hla,1579487279.0,"Please don't feel guilty, you are entitled to space. You've gone thru some very dramatic changes, you need time to rest and heal and to get to know LO. But later, find some time to talk to you SO about the changes."
rickandmorty,fewn5dd,t1_fewho1f,1579415396.0,Very nice
depression,fewhsba,t3_eqs3m3,1579410818.0,"Hey you're not alone. It seems dark right now, I get that. I'm trying not to slip into that myself. It's like crawling through jello. 

Something that I'm trying to do to keep myself afloat is to identify how I feel. For example, when I locked my keys in my car this morning, I felt angry and frustrated. It helps me to be able to name the emotions that I'm feeling, like once they have names, I can deal with them better.

It's something that helps me, it might not help you, and that's ok. But you're not alone. And I would miss you."
rickandmorty,fewgunk,t3_eqs3qk,1579410363.0,"It looks cool. The painting and the spray can are like one piece together, right? What's the medium, like it's out all spray paint?"
AskReddit,fej2bcv,t3_epf2uf,1579154283.0,"Poopy diaper, people think babies don't have stinky poops, and I've even had some friends tell me that they never gagged. I'm happy for them, I'm just not one of them. My kid is cute but that's definitely concentrated evil coming out the back of her."
BDSMcommunity,fej1z5c,t3_epf35r,1579153964.0,"I mean I really don't tell a while lot of people about it. I did tell my parents once, my dad said he didn't want to know that and I think I said ""oh shit, sorry."" And changed the subject."
JUSTNOMIL,fefmlvw,t1_feepvp9,1579059597.0,Your kids (should you have any) will be much better prepared in regards to navigating their own heads simply because you're aware of what you went through and you can help them. At least that's what I feel myself when I look at my 4 month old.
JUSTNOMIL,feeh62r,t1_feedf1w,1579033667.0,I struggle with point 2 with my own mom. Please at least talk to your fianc√© about what she's doing and how it makes you feel.
fatlogic,fd0chzz,t1_fcxbwe7,1578116873.0,"Right? Like, can someone please explain how racism is anti-fat? As a fat white person, I feel like there's a lot of people like me."
JUSTNOMIL,fd03ynh,t3_ejkir4,1578113278.0,"Any time you mention breastfeeding to her, or she brings it up, just say, ""I know, I know, I'm SUCH a masochist."" Then change the subject. If she continues to push, tell her the pain feels good."
fatlogic,fcwp5o8,t1_fcwbyi8,1578032305.0,"Seriously, the doctor always seems way more uncomfortable about the talk than I do."
fatlogic,fcwp1so,t1_fcweit8,1578032196.0,I seriously didn't know this was a thing that could be requested.
fatlogic,fcwoyk1,t1_fcwgev2,1578032105.0,"Right? Like, you're gonna go to the doctor and then tell the doctor what's healthy? Why?"
fatlogic,fcwolvn,t3_ej6o9x,1578031755.0,"Wtf? I've never felt fat shamed by the ""hey, you know you're great, right?"" conversation that doctors wanna have. Like, they seem more self-conscious about the whole thing than me. But seriously it goes:

Doc: Yo dude, you know you're fat, right?

Me: yeah dude, I know. Real talk tho, most of the time I'm too fucking sad to eat a salad.

Doc: oh man, maybe talk to a specialist about that sadness thing tho.

Me: totes dude, I got a specialist for that shit tho.

Doc: cool cool cool. Do do you like, exercise bruh?

Me: yeah, kinda. Like, maybe once a week. Babies make everything a difficulty level of ten tho lolz.

Doc: ok, well try for like 30 min a day tho. Ok fam?

Me: Will do."

facepalm,fcvcq1d,t1_fcvbatn,1577999353.0,Omg! Thank you
JUSTNOMIL,fccf147,t3_eh1c28,1577597647.0,"Start by telling her how her actions make you feel. Be firm, respectful and kind. Don't apologize. It's not about what you did, it's about what she did. Just don't yell or name-call either. 

If she can have a conversation about her behavior, you might be able to help her."
JUSTNOMIL,faqs96e,t1_faolrqm,1576307413.0,Yes!. Absolutely fight passive aggressive bullshit with directness.
