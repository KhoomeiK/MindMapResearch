No, your reading comprehension is just very poor. I was clearly saying that it's absurd to expect data from a survey of millions of people. That's why the next sentence was about polling. 99 out of 100 people would have understood that, but it's okay to need a little extra help.

You are an absolute clown. Neither CNN nor Axios performed those polls. They are just reporting the results.

>You don't care about being correct, you want to be ""right"".

Correct and right are the same thing. This is a really stupid semantics argument.

>You'd rather blindly go on thinking you were right instead of keeping an open mind and being correct. You get to be right if you stick your fingers in your ears and hum when any other information comes at you! Can't be true if I can't hear you!

Okay, let's put that to the test. I said most because it's most. There is polling data to support that, like [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/08/17/politics/trump-approvers-never-stop-approving-poll/index.html&ved=2ahUKEwih-qvnmvfmAhUJGs0KHbCYCxAQFjAAegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw37f1VFM8RmACEJdRWBGZBw&ampcf=1) and [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.axios.com/monmouth-poll-trump-approval-a05b8144-1d1b-4296-a0d4-6ca0390b05ee.html). There is no bias you goofball, just data. It's not ""millions"" of people because that's absurd. That isn't how polling works.

It's funny that you'd call me blind when you're the ignorant one who is so convinced that you're correct that you didn't even bother to look into it before you made this stupidly arrogant post.
