>Many states already ban 10 round magazines and that quite frankly might as well be banning all guns. 95% of handguns have more than 10 round in a magazine and somebody who is interested in crime isn't going to have a problem with modifying ""limited"" ones.

There is so much wrong here I can't even begin. 8 states ban high capacity magazines. Magazines are detachable, I could make a 100 million round magazines if I had a desire (and strong enough floor), so your 95% figure is just moronic (let's not even start that you forgot revolvers). Yes criminals can and will break laws (that's what makes them criminals), but if they are forced to manufacture a magazine with 10+ rounds less criminals will have them then if they could go to Walmart and buy one.
