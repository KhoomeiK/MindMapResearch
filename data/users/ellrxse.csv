bulletjournal,fdrrxot,t1_fdrkztq,1578688872.0,"I do the exact same thing haha! Collage is your best friend when you're a bit of a perfectionist, hey. Well either way, awesome work!"
bulletjournal,fdr6aty,t3_emuems,1578680120.0,"Ah this is awesome, in love with your aesthetic!"
bulletjournal,fdr277k,t1_fdqw59h,1578678451.0,"Aw you're so kind, thank you!"
bulletjournal,fdquliz,t1_fdqtgf7,1578675146.0,Thanks! I attached the strings to the booklets before sticking them to the page to avoid this problem! I also cover most of my pages with black card or brown paper so it's not an issue ‚ò∫Ô∏è
bulletjournal,fdqu6la,t1_fdqsupv,1578674951.0,"To me, regular journaling involves making artistic pages as standalone pieces of art, whereas I use this to do all of the exact same things that are done in a bullet journal. I just decorate it differently. This is just how I personally organise my shit to get stuff done. I feel that bullet journals sometimes alienate those who aren't minimalists or 'neat,' so this was simply my way of taking a different route with it, as the ""typical"" bullet journal isn't personally functional for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è You could try r/bujo though, they seem to have a lot of really awesome spreads that you may like!"
bulletjournal,fdqsvna,t1_fdqs9cf,1578674162.0,"Aw that's so kind of you to say, thank you! You should give something like this a go, I'm sure you could do it!"
bulletjournal,fdqsbgx,t1_fdqkrbh,1578673818.0,Thanks a lot! ü§òüèª
bulletjournal,fdqg0we,t3_empf01,1578665735.0,"This looks great! You're definitely good at art, in my opinion! Such a creative way to do a to-do list. Are you going to be 'ticking' them off, or colouring them in when you've completed them?"
bulletjournal,fdqftgx,t3_empgqr,1578665585.0,Aw I love the colours you've used! And it's sooo neat!
bulletjournal,fdqf3rq,t1_fdqds92,1578665041.0,"The journal's getting a bit bulky, I'll admit, but it's nothing an elastic cord can't keep closed! Plus I personally love journals and sketchbooks that are bursting at the seams üòÖ It's practical for me, yes, because I'm one of those 'organised chaos' type of people - my brain just doesn't respond to clean, neat layouts, and in the past I ended up abandoning 2 attempted bullet journals because I was trying to stick to that aesthetic. By making my journal more collaged and interactive, it forces me to be organised because I enjoy interacting with it so much! It's all personal taste, I guess ‚ò∫Ô∏è but I totally get that it wouldn't be ideal for some people!"
bulletjournal,fdqed98,t1_fdqbtnc,1578664471.0,"You're so sweet, thank you!"

bulletjournal,fdotmr8,t3_emetrw,1578612599.0,"Never seen a mood tracker done with tea bags before, looks awesome!"
bulletjournal,fdotkgm,t3_emga9m,1578612560.0,Hahaha best use of calligraphy I've ever seen. There are waaaay too many people in the world who need this tattooed in their forehead üòÖ
bulletjournal,fdotegg,t3_emc7c5,1578612455.0,"This is such a sick idea, keep with it!!"

bulletjournal,fdosp6c,t1_fdohksv,1578612012.0,Hahaha I just fart-laughed through my nose
bulletjournal,fdoslbv,t1_fdoawgz,1578611946.0,"I like that phrase, straight off the dome! If I'm understanding it right then yeah, it came out of my own head - I'm always doing little projects like this. But I'm sure there was something I saw once upon a time that allowed me to think it up in the first place. All art is imitation, as the saying goes ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
bulletjournal,fdo1o5x,t1_fdnxq9x,1578597251.0,Aw thank you!
