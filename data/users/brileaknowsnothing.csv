insaneparents,ffaz83r,t1_ffapr39,1579747915.0,"Insulin resistance is at the heart of PCOS. I don't support weight loss surgery, it's a mutilation of the body that can kill you, which I've seen first hand. However, any overweight person with PCOS can drastically mitigate their condition through reduction of carbs and BMI"

Some have kind hearts and an ability to connect. Then there are the 'bad'. Some are monstrous, just looking for an excuse to abuse and perhaps even kill. Some are walking caricatures of ineptitude, some are just really fucking dumb and completely unaware of how dumb they are. You? You fall in that last one, 100%."

You tried to just flip the same insult back around, which doesn't work very well when one of us is highly educated and the other can't grasp basic concepts. In reality, you should be familiar with at least the idea of metaphors even if you never went to school at all."

Your house gets broken into, they rush over immediately, dust for prints, conduct a long and difficult investigation, and convict the bad guy in the end? You're delusional, they'll show up two hours later, write a half assed report which you can pay for a copy of later in the week, and leave, without your case ever crossing their mind again"
menwritingwomen,ff5ysyr,t1_ff552tp,1579614601.0,Is the '[snip]' thing being used in place of a basic ellipsis?
dontyouknowwhoiam,ff538l2,t1_ff2xkb2,1579579013.0,It'd be a lot simpler to just not allow elective feticide at ANY point in the human life cycle.
dontyouknowwhoiam,ff53448,t1_ff3435h,1579578920.0,"It'd be cool if we spent less time arguing which semantics are best suited to the purpose of homicidal dehumanization, and more time fighting for the right to life, without which no other human rights can exist."

dontyouknowwhoiam,ff52wqx,t3_er8dcp,1579578761.0,Isn't this the woman who brags about all the feticides she commits? A woman who makes a living killing the children of other women. Now THAT is internalized misogyny.

And you people eat it the fuck up, for breakfast lunch and dinner. Absolutely obsessed, and completely ignorant / apathetic to those in actual power, and to the actual workings and intentions of the government. It's sad as hell but you can't really expect most people to think for themselves, the propaganda (of which he is such an integral piece) is too strong. Meant to shut down your mind and lord has it worked. The disgusting part is that you don't even try to do better, you don't even try to look beyond the superficial theatrics because you truly enjoy the obsession, you come up with dumb shit like what you just said and somehow feel clever.
