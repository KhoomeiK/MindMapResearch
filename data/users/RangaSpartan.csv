tifu,fee5ocv,t3_eomyn9,1579026917.0,"I accidentally did “B... uh... Bee!!” And there was just silence on the end of the phone till I went “like a bumble bee?” And they went “Ooooooh!” 

I was so embarrassed!"
AskWomen,fed5liq,t1_fecw9nj,1579000008.0,"Are you me?! I did like, exactly the same thing. I think I actually watched it 3 times in one day.... It's just so good!"
fatlogic,fdgdt70,t1_fdg4pov,1578392027.0,"Oh wow, I had no idea that was a thing. I think I knew that you're not meant to guzzle water after being severely dehydrated (but to be fair I only knew that because I read a load of pirate story books which all seemed to involve a shipwreck...), but I didn't know it was for food as well. That's really interesting!"
fatlogic,fdgdqf2,t1_fdfnk3n,1578391917.0,"15 years! Wow, I actually had no idea it went away at higher BMIs as well, that's so interesting. Do you know why that would be? Or is it due to your specific hormone imbalance as you mentioned?"
progresspics,fcx64m6,t3_eje2vv,1578052810.0,"45kg?! Holy crap, that's amazing!  You look so good, I hope you're very proud of what you've achieved :)"
progresspics,fcx63br,t3_ejeelq,1578052771.0,"Amazing progress, you look so good! Also, I love the new hair colour :)"
progresspics,fcx61v7,t3_ejef4q,1578052724.0,You look great! I hope you're very proud of yourself :)

xxfitness,fcx3fye,t3_ejdhor,1578049538.0,"Did legs this morning, first time since the holiday break, and I think I might actually be dead. I can't get up out of my chair without making the most horrendous groaning, and my colleagues keep laughing at me :("
1200isfineIGUESSugh,fcx1qma,t1_fcuyew7,1578047345.0,"I think it's very easy for us to be harsh on ourselves - We can sometimes see an accidental cheat meal as a moral failing, rather than just an ""Oops, that was probably a bit higher calorie than I would have liked!"" I know I've definitely been guilty of this in the past. Are you maintaining or losing at the moment?"
fatlogic,fcx1hmg,t1_fcx12ow,1578047020.0,That's really interesting - I wonder why there's such a difference!
fatlogic,fcwxyni,t1_fcwfew1,1578042421.0,"Completely off-topic, but I have the radio on and eye of the tiger came on, and I read your comment just as they did the chorus. Felt very strange for a second!"
fatlogic,fcwx2cg,t1_fcwvb7o,1578041293.0,"That's what I was just thinking! I live in the UK, so medical practises might be different than the US, but I only go to the doctor once or twice a year. Also, I'm pretty sure the last time I was weighed at a doctors' was about 6 or 7 years ago, when I went to go and get the contraceptive pill - I think they need to weigh you for that to make sure the dose is right."
1200isfineIGUESSugh,fcuhkvm,t1_fctq5i2,1577981136.0,"Awh sweetheart, do remember to be kind to yourself. I don't mean to stick my beak in, but something in the way you wrote your post just struck a bit of a chord with me, so I wanted to check in. I know we all get so focused on our Ultimate Goal Weight^(tm), and getting there as quick as possible, but we have the rest of our lives ahead of us. So what if your goal gets set back a few weeks - it was Christmas! And I'm sure you enjoyed everything you ate, so at the end of the day who cares!"

That's what I get for 3 hours sleep!!"
britishproblems,fctu3d6,t1_fctosod,1577959585.0,"Whatever do you mean - It's my favourite part of the day, being able to bark ""Stand on the left"" to people on the escalators on the tube! The adrenaline keeps me fuelled for the rest of the week.

edit: I meant 'right' instead of 'left' arghhh!"
britishproblems,fcttpq0,t3_eiog5x,1577959020.0,Sat in the office running on 3 hours sleep because I couldn't drift off for love nor money. I've announced to the office that 3pm today is nap time.

TalesFromYourServer,fckqc1p,t1_fckoedo,1577730899.0,"My hometown friendship group have a big dinner each Christmas, about 35-40 of us, and this year we had two parallel tables in a back room. It was so much fun, we could swivel and talk to the other table! So much better than one long one, or even an ‘L’ shape."
AskReddit,fagmywp,t1_fag0vbg,1576063696.0,"Holy shit, the way you wrote this... I felt like I was there! My heart was pounding by the end of it. I'm a hugely nervous flier, I'm so glad you were okay."
