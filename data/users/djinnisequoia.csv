If someone is doing that to you, that is not ""disrespect,"" it is an attack. Of course people become cynical (wary,  mistrustful of others' motives) if they are repeatedly attacked.

But if we're talking about actual social disrespect -- people being shitty or insulting or imperious or rude to you -- then, as I said, it's useful to remember that they have only damaged your pride, not your dignity. Your dignity is what enables you to enter your next encounter with someone without expecting them to be a shithead too."

bestof,ffisoel,t1_ffi6qjp,1579981732.0,"Thank you so much for this explanation. It gives me so much more insight into the rural perspective than I ever had before.

You must remember that, just like country people, to those born in the city, that's all they know. I live in California, and let me tell you, there are definitely landlords who don't fix anything. I have had to learn how to do plumbing and electrical work and how to patch, spackle & paint. There's a lot more poor people in the city than rich people, and poor urban people don't hate rural people at all. I dunno, around here it seems like nobody hates anybody. EXCEPT for class issues. Rich people look down on poor people everywhere.

It sounds to me like rural folks are confusing city liberals with RICH liberals, which are two completely different things."

(they say that the distance between the nucleus of an atom and its electron shell is roughly proportionate to the distance between the Earth and Sun)
