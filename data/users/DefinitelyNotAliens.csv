AskMen,ffeg2tg,t1_ffefiit,1579846642.0,"My cousin is a judge, her husband is a computer engineer. She considers them both to be pretty smart people. They had date night and he got excited as they walked through a park near the restaurant and found an old tetherball pole srt up to play. He ran over yelling that he used to play all the time. Maybe mid to late thirties at the time. Punches straight on at the ball and it slips sideways and he just ends up punching the pole.

He says he think he broke his hand (spoiler: he did) and should go to the hospital. She drives him over and thinks nothing of the face he has his ring on. He not only punched a pole but also thinks nothing of the face his ring is on. Doesn't think abour it until he realizes his whole hand minus one finger hurts and realizes blood flow is cut off.

Get to the hospital and the ER staff has to cut his wedding ring off, after a very helpful doctor says, 'if this doesn't work we can always cut off your finger and reattach it.'

He was very panicked. Maybe it was a poorly timed joke? I can't imagine they cut off fingers if rings get stuck and cut off bloodflow and can't cut the ring off.

But yeah- silicone wedding rings. Good idea."

aww,ffe7d9w,t1_ffdmdmk,1579838673.0,"My family surrendered a dog. We had a large yard and another dog to keep her company. We gave her lots of walks, affection, worked with her for months.

But without fail- if we left her alone when I was in class and my parents were at work she'd chew at drywall or dig up the yard. She had toys and regular walks.

Simply put though, she needed people- not another animal friend. We were not the right home. As a golden retriever mix her behavior was outside the norm and we gave her almost a year to settle before we decided she was just not happy with us.

We found an adoption group and she stayed with us as a foster but paid for her medical care and food in that time and were very honest she was both high energy and needed a person home with her. Good with cats and children and other dogs.

We found a family with one stay at home mom, a small dog and two kids. Kids wanted another dog and mom wanted a dog for her mile plus long runs in the morning. She was home most days and we were honest she was destructive when left alone too much and what her needs were and found a home that could manage her.

The shelter we got her from said she was high energy and thought walks and another dog in a yard big enough to run and play in would keep her happy- but we didn't know it was anxiety and loneliness that were her real issues. Found a home that was a much, much better fit and she'd be happier. It's not fun giving away a dog but she wasn't her happiest with us. Needed a person around with her.

Really, she was a good dog when we were around so it was hard to let her go but she was clearly unhappy when we were gone and we couldn't be with her in the day. She had about six hours on her own and that was too much."
realtors,ffe5pjp,t1_ffdoekl,1579837387.0,"You can use websites that rank cost of living versus income. Even if your income is high it'll effect schools (because of low property taxes), political climate and general livability.

Find an area with a decent balance, especially since you may want to leave your job later. A low cost of living isn't great because maybe they have a really, really low average income. Low cost of living does not mean affordability.

Check overall school performace- even if you don't have kids better schools= better resale later.

Check hospital access/ healthcare options. Some swaths of the US have very little in the way of hospitals. Some states don't have level one trauma centers. Don't want to use them but if you need one... you may want one relatively nearby.

Do you need an international airport? How far is the nearest one?

College towns tend to have decent nightlife and more events than non-college towns. Even a small college will have more art shows/ plays/ music events than a town without them. Don't need a major college to have just a little more than average.

What do you like? Beer? Wine? Kayaks? Hiking? Hunting? Are there hobbies or activities you'd need local access to? An acting troupe, hiking trails, corgi enthusiast group, local brew pubs to try out, wineries, frisbee golf... whatever you like to do, is it available there?"

Sundays have such big viewership numbers for football because of that. If Saturday was better the NFL would've taken Saturdays back from college ball ages ago. During playoffs when they have Saturday games the viewership is lower.

Playoff games aren't regular- and if you have two playoff games on Saturday and Sunday- Saturday has lower views.

The Super Bowl would have lower views on Saturday because so many people will do a watch parties because they don't have other plans.

If you have plans... all those viewers who don't normally tune in will be more likely to skip. There isn't competition from other programs or from other parties. Change to Saturday and those odds of conflict are more likely."

Last downsize two months back there was also about 1/3 of a set of silver that nobody will try to finish because most of the forks are missing- thus it's useless- and I'm holding onto it and will sell it when silver goes up because it's at the bottom. Set isn't popular so it's value is that of the silver content. Cash will go back to my parents whenever I decide silver is up enough to cash it out. I'm holding to make sure they get the money when the market swings up for precious metals.

You don't see Tesla faking gear shifts. Your Honda or Subie or Nissan doesn't need to, either. Direct electric drive and CVTs don't gave gear shift points. Straight acceleration from 0-60 should be a selling point.

Explain the CVT is gearless and always has you in the best power band all the time and doesn't need shift points. It's not a sports car- it's a Civic, Sentra or base Impreza.

Gear shifts will die along with the gasoline engine. Gas is dying and electric won't mimic it for people. Let the CVT be a CVT while gas dies out."

In terms of solar failing- I was refering to nuclear meltdowns like Chernobyl or natural disasters like Fukushima causing containment breeches of their nuclear materials. Solar and wind can't fail on that scale and both those disasters were recent enough to where people are scared of nuclear. Nobody wants nuclear in their backyard. Stick one in the midwest- tornados. Stick on on the west coast- earthquakes. Stick one on the east coast- hurricanes. Nobody wants one. Aside from the initial cost they're unpopular. Nobody wants one in their backyard. Engineer for catastrophe all you want- it's a fact we cannot control nature and another Fukushima is always a risk- however small- and nobody wants it it their backyard.

That means it get shuffled somewhere people can't block it which means we put them in the sticks and you run into an issue of finding qualified engineers. Huge pay and moving bonuses will be the only way to get staffing.

If you want to know why nuclear isn't in the Green New Deal... it's a matter of optics- because nobody wants to have nuclear built near them- and cost.

Wind and solar are cheaper. Hydroelectric doesn't terrify people. Geothermal and tidal are getting more attention.

I never said nuclear was evil or that solar was a be-all, end-all for power generation. Nuclear has a bad reputation, high start-up cost, is politically unpopular and requires better engineers to run than solar or windfarms.

That is why it's not in any Green New Deal proposals. It's not that it isn't a reasonable option- but it's the least popular. It's a reason- not argument for or against."
worldnews,ff73ydn,t1_ff73hee,1579640641.0,"Well, of part of the Green New Deal is long-term economic gain then nuclear doesn't have to be a part of it. Whether carbon taxes are introduced is another point altogether but nuclear is expensive, has a long downtime between start to up and running and is less publicly backed because of issues like Fukushima and Chernobyl. It's not like all risks aren't a real (albiet small) risk. It's not strange they ignore nuclear considering it's expensive and requires a much higher degree of specialist to operate.

Major cities don't want nuclear nearby. It means a remote location with a lot of college educated people. That doesn't exist- thus, you have to pay enough to make them move. It's a lot more complex than building a plant.

Wind and solar? Not so much an issue."
worldnews,ff73gou,t1_ff72wbg,1579640362.0,"Nuclear costs more than wind and solar to produce and wind and solar take less time to install and allow a decentralization of the power grid. Some of the biggest vulnerabilities the US has for terror attacks are power generation and communications systems. We'd be crippled. You can have one plant power an entire state, it costs more twice as much to build, has a decade long process for permits, training for employees and building the plant.

Or you build a lot of less expensive solar and wind farms all over and spread the grid out. Solar is around $46 per mwh for a large utility scale system and wind $30 while nuclear is more than $100.

We have a lot of options to expand other systems that aren't that expensive, or will fall with time. Wind and solar are economically viable compared to nuclear."

The average cost per MWH for a new nuclear site is 112 dollars versus 46 for solar or 30 for wind.

There's also the fact that a solar and wind farm can be fully insured, wind tends to pick up when solar falls and nuclear is more expensive to insure. You've got several large scale failures of nuclear plants. You've never heard of solar plants failing. The solar maintenance and wind maintenance are less over time and don't require the same level of engineer to run.

Nuclear is not really economically viable- even against renewables. It's not even the risk of failure. It's cost/ benefit. More solar and wind is less $$$. Dollars and cents."

Dude is not answering so I find stubborn butt up on my brother's bed. This diva has tucked himself into bed. He is under the covers with his head up on the pillow. ""Loki, buddy, go poop before bed."" He can come right back in. He just needs to go outside to use the facilities.

Dog lifts his head up, 'Nope.' Puts his head right back down. This big, fluffybutt jerk looked right at me and ignored me.

Not to be stopped by a dog that is nearly my own body weight I go over and *grab his collar*. Not the polar bear my brother confused for a dog- his collar.

He starts yelping and crying and runs off like I hurt him. I stared that dog down and he dragged his feet down the hall. Stopped on the first landing to scratch. Loki- dude.

Background- this big baby was adopted by my brother before he left the litter. His friends adopted a dog off a mountainside and she was half starved and had eleven surprise puppies for them. They had too many and my brother literally bottle fed this dog and helped give him shots and cuddled him from like two weeks old and this is his baby.

awfuleverything,ff402xv,t1_ff3wg01,1579552613.0,"That's factually wrong. I studied this in college. Look, Africa had empires. Africa had art and culture and large scale governments. Africa developed. Africa had industrialized farming, to some degree. Not western levels.

And you know why? Because their crops were different, they had lower rainfall and did not have large beast of burden animals the way Europeans did. Horses and oxen could be easily domesticated. Those animals didn't exist in large swaths of Africa and thus the development of the large scale industrialization didn't exist the way it did in Europe. The parts it did have those in were less suited to farming due to heat and water supplies but did have large scale civilizations along the Mediterranean.

Further south tribes were still largely hunter gatherer in the interior and the larger civilizations rimmed the coast. Why? Because again- large scale farming requires heavy animals they didn't have, clearing of dense forests and scatter crops. They're the first crops you develop in early civilization. Wheat, corn, quinoa. Crops you throw on the ground and they grow. Not common in southern Africa. Lack of abundant staple crops contributed. But we'll come back.

What was different on the coasts? Fishing access. They didn't have to store as much of staple crops due to fishing access. Year round massive food supplies.

Now, interior of Africa. A good hunter-gatherer will only really actively work 4-6 hours a day. Far less than a farm laborer. Now, why would you quit this to work harder to farm? If your area won't support the population you have to. But the area did support them. They developed exactly to where they needed to be for their area and population. They had it good. Adapted to environment.

AND THEN THE WHITE MAN ARRIVED. We had warfare on levels unseen by Africa. Showed up with gold and silk and spices and cannons and gunpowder and heavy artillery. Steamrollered the little guys and took over. And they did not care what they stripped. They deforested swaths of previously forested lands. Countries that had trees and scrub got devestated because Europeans who wanted wood for repairs to ships or building their style of buildings stripped the lands and fragile ecosystems that worked before got stripped and never recovered and they're still trying to replant.

Some more powerful African nations saw the writing on the wall and the rich sold the poor. Literally. They sent out hunting parties and captured rival tribes on the fringes and sold them as slaves. And yes- slavery existed in Africa but not the way Europeans did it. There was no chattle slavery and children of slaves were not always slaves themselves. It was more a Roman idea of slavery where you could get freedom.

And the rich stripped their countries wealth for powerful outsiders.

Then came more Europeans and they slowly moved down the continent. And all economic and societal development ground to a halt. Gold, oil, jewels, people- they stripped it all. Europe was building empires and colleges and democracies while Africa was told to produce, produce, produces and all the wealth was funneled north to whatever state controlled that area. No colleges built, no local businesses to grow into international conglomerates. Balance was gone.

And we talk about Mao. Stalin. Hitler. Killed a lot of people. You know who you don't hear about? He killed more than Hitler during the Holocaust and we never talk about King Leopold II of Belgium. He ordered the slaughter of millions of Congolese when he decided he wanted an empire and not a nation. The cartridge rifle was expensive and many stilled used muzzle loaders for this reason. But he used the cartridge and told soldiers to cut off the left hand of a Congolese for every round spent to account for munitions use which meant not onlu did he kill somewhere around 10-15 million people he ordered the torture and mutilations of millions more.

If you want a reason for so many failed states in Africa- look at hundreds of years of systemic abuses and stripping of all resources that halted development followed by a rapid withdrawal of European nations following the Second World War which lead to massive power grabs by whichever businessman with a private army benefited the most during the Age of Imperialism."

news,ff2b6qc,t1_ff23spa,1579499368.0,"I'm not sure where this guy is basing his experiences. I've worked with the homeless and at-risk populations via volunteer work with an organization run by my older sister.

There are organizations that do require a lot out of the participants and have curfews and drug testing requirements as a part of their programs. They're usually more of a halfway home. It's not really controlling- it's a simple fact that when working with homeless populations that drug abuse and mental health issues are rampant.

If you're going to be a program with some of them they need to see work towards program completion. The chronically homeless are different than short-term homeless. A short term homeless may be employed or recently become unemployed. The chronically homeless are different.

The programs don't usually differentiate between the short and long-term homeless. Because of this, some of the short-term homeless find the programs to be restrictive and draconian. Except the rules are more for the chronically homeless. When you've been removed from society from some time it really is difficult to come back into things, at times. Hence very strict rules because if they can't manage to be up and showered by six-thirty for breakfast and stick to rigid schedules and be back by ten PM and complete drug testing and jobs training they are likely be unable to graduate the program and handle a boss five days a week. A part of it is to make sure you can handle a micro managing boss and finances and everything else others deal with day to day.

It's also to get rid of the ones that are more difficult to help. Some want just want food and shelter with no forward self-progress and it's a hard truth but if you can help fifteen people- you want fifteen who will hopefully leave and be okay afterwards and not two who graduate and thirteen addicts and mentally ill who refuse treatment for those other issues. Limited resources means you sometimes pick who you help and pick the easiest to help and most likely to thrive. Food kitchens don't restrict access and neither do some emergency shelters.

Strict rules are usually for a more intensive program. Ones with counselors and jobs help.

Lastly- the only homeless who are ever held hostage are those under arrest or on a 51-50. The workers at shelters of course get favorites that they invite back to volunteer to talk to current program attendees to prove they can better their lives. But they don't have pets. They're people. They keep track of some of their former clients and check in and make sure they're still doing okay.

Doesn't make them pets. The social workers recognize humanity in those they help- and even the ones they have to turn away. It's a matter of limited help and resources. Some agencies have to turn some down while others are designed to help on a broader scope. It's just how they are designed to function."

As much fun as it is to point to big government as the bad guh it seems to me it was the supervisor or spotter who failed, not the pre-planned process. Either a supervisor didn't explain they had to do visual checks or failed to ensure it happened or the spotter knew and chose to ignore process.

The machine operator was told to go ahead. Somebody did attempt to maintain safety for the homeless and it fell apart on the ground. A check was supposed to happen and for whatever reason this guy didn't answer. Maybe he thought it was police and he'd be arrested for squatting and tried to keep quiet. Maybe he didn't speak English and was scared. Maybe he was on drugs and melting into the ground. Maybe he was mentally ill and there's no reason that makes sense to anyone but him in that moment. Whatever it was- the spotter failed to properly check and told the machine operator to go ahead.

Despite that- the presence of a spotter says somebody did want to check on the homeless and it fell apart at the end.

The city is near me and what I'd consider a little trashy anyways. Not the nicest place to live. Not high crime but... not nice either. I guess it'd make sense the 'nice' neighborhood isn't all that nice.

Driving through there- a new subdivision that was supposed to be upper middle class- and seeing people have rotting cars in lawns, weeds calf high and terrible attempts to paint garage doors to make your home interesting? It was the first time I got why people sometimes like HOAs.

You buy a new house in a neighborhood being built and there's really nothing stopping the place from going from nice to trashy in under fifteen years.

I was so confused. The stuff really did bring down the whole neighborhood. Other than trash, lawns as driveways, weeds, dead plants, kids toys all over and some bizarre color palettes it should have been a nice, upper middle class neighborhood.

Then again, where I grew up was new construction with no HOAs and it's still fine. Other remedy is to buy established neighborhoods and check to see if anyone has that hot rod they're gonna fix up growing out of their weeds. Less likely to tank if there's a lot of homeowners who don't put inside furniture directly on the lawn and hang out like that.

It was the first and only time I realized why somebody would want an HOA. Good homeowners mildly suffer but it saves them from the truly terrible neighbors."

During the day I don't even really use my lights. Rather have the blinds open for soft natural light and not have artificial lights.

It's okay for a bedroom to be a quiet spot and have TVs in communal spots."

I just recognize that if ADA compliance requires a small business to spend 200% of their yearly income to make compliance and shut down for weeks and lower the later income due to table spacing that maybe there should be a deferred action or minimal action because Walmart versus the little guy should have differing compliance *if the bathroom had been there prior to ADA.* They didn't build it out of compliance. They built before compliance existed and it ran them out of business.

That's unreasonable and we don't live in a black and white dichotomy."

Netflix settled and agreed to do CC and their agreement ran out but continue to do so. Amazon Prime chooses to do so- likely for people that leave them on due to watching while eating crunchy snacks as I chose the believe there are crunchy snack eaters like myself that want normal volume and dialouge than deaf. Crunchy snacks like tortilla chips and dip are great.

However, as purely web-based services with no federal funding or license they do not have to caption. YouTube started to offer AI captioning that's hilariously bad but were not required to, either.

Pornhub has no obligation to caption videos."

news,femzt4n,t1_femqqzv,1579273761.0,"It wasn't eff their right to taxpayer funded education. The videos and audio are available to students, still. Berkeley supports their students with ADA compliance.

The complaint came from Galludet University staff. Galludet is a deaf university back east. They offer a lot more comprehensive deaf studies programs and such. Maybe they were trying to access lectures by other professors? Students from their classes realized they could watch the videos or read a transcript of the podcast?

The complaint came from outside the university. You could have no connection and watch a lecture on theoretical physics or philosophy or art from UC Berkeley staff.

This was a repository for students that happened to be open to the public. DOJ got a complaint from the public. Instead if implementing a plan- captions, ect on all new content and retro everything over five years- Berkeley shut it down over funding they didn't have.

It was never about access to education. It was access to another university's system so they cut outside access."
