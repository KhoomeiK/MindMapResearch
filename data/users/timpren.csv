EarthPorn,fewm4td,t3_eqqvvz,1579414293.0,"This is where I was based when I worked two summers in Yellowstone. Truly one of the most spectacular canyons in America and one of the most beautiful and majestic waterfalls in the world. Canyon Village is the name of the “town” nearby where all the lodging, facilities and restaurants are. I used to hike frequently down to the ledge just to the right of the top of the falls. If you zoom in you can see a whole lot of people standing there. One night a bunch of us even dragged our sleeping bags down and slept on that ledge. Not a good decision. The roar of the falls didn’t turn into white noise...it just remained a roar and we were soaking wet from the updraft spray that would engulf us. Still a memorable night and a spectacular experience when I was 18-19 years old."

OldSchoolCool,femakc8,t1_felan9m,1579246087.0,Can’t be. Those are coconut palms in the background and coconut palms do not grow anywhere in California.

This cannot be California.

The world is smack dab in the middle of its most statistically peaceful period in modern history and probably in recorded history since the population of the planet is now about 7 billion people. Fewer people are dying due to warfare now then ever before. Now that’s not to say that we don’t live in a violent, unfair, dangerous world. And this Pax Humana may actually not last much longer due to the vast migrations that are anticipated as the world warms and water resources become scarce.  Vast uncontrolled human migrations driven by climate change and water resource scarcity will lead to violent and deadly wars and upheaval...but for now, at this moment, this is statistically considered a very peaceful time as measured by human deaths due to warfare.

When he didn’t like something Wikipedia said about his regime (what wiki said was true by the way) he censored and blocked Wikipedia from being available within Turkey. He arranged a fake coup a few years ago so that he could consolidate his power by locking up his legal opposition made up of liberals and intellects and university professors and other members of Turkey’s social structure and military leadership that he views as potential trouble for his political standing. He’s making deals with Islamists just like the Americans did with the religious right so that he can get their backing...which comes at great cost to secular freedoms in Turkey. He has a tight grip on Turkey and what was once a promising, growing and vital democracy is in clear retrograde. This is how it happens. You elect a charming, well dressed charismatic leader who promises all kinds of democratic progress and reforms and then he tightens his grip while undermining the very democracy that elected him.
