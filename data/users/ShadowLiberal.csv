Tesla themselves has listed the Prius among the 5 most commonly traded in cars for a Tesla.

What this really shows to me is Toyota messed up BIG by not investing in an EV version of their Prius. Toyota's Prius owners just wanted an EV (both for environmental reasons, and because EV's save a lot on fuel & maintenance), but Toyota refused to give it to them, so now those people are buying Tesla's instead. 

I honestly think when people look back a decade from now, Toyota's failure to make an EV version of the Prius will go down as one of the most long term costly mistakes in the auto industry. Toyota had plenty of market share and money to stop Tesla in their tracks before they took off, by beating them to the punch at making a good EV. But they didn't, and now Toyota will be paying for that mistake for decades."

It depends upon how long your time horizon is. If you have 10+ years you should go for more dividend growth stocks, that have a history of raising their dividend at least 5% a year, and still have room to grow their dividends. Overtime you'll get higher dividend yields from those stocks by holding them for a number of years.

Back when Toyota unintended acceleration stories were a thing there was one somewhat famous 'unintended acceleration' story that popped up after the media was already talking about. A woman was backing out of her driveway, and drove full force into the fence of the neighbor across the street. She blamed it on her Toyota Prius accelerating unintentionally, but a police investigation determined that she slammed hard on the accelerator (and likely mixed it and the brakes up).

And then there's some people who engage in showmanship for other reasons. There was a guy who claimed his Prius was unintentionally accelerating rapidly on the high way, who in a 15 minute 'police chase' managed to 'stop' it and swore he'd never drive another Prius again. It got a bunch of headlines at the time as another example of the accelerating Prius. But then Toyota & government investigators determined that the guy was full of BS after studying the car.

investing,feyofb1,t3_eqpxha,1579448257.0,"Ignore the people who say to avoid dividend investing, there's pros and cons to every investing strategy. Just because you don't like dividend investing doesn't mean it's not a proven strategy that works for a lot of people. It's actually best to start dividend investing at a young age like you are, because of how compound interest works for building up a larger dividend income stream.

Yes dividend investing rules out a bunch of non dividend paying stocks that get a bunch of capital appreciation, but investing isn't just about maximizing gains, it's also about capital preservation. Dividend paying companies are often safer more firmly established companies with less future growth potential.

With dividend investing the key to it is sticking with the strategy long term. Dividend paying companies often raise their dividend overtime, which means if you hold their shares for a number of years, your dividend yield on cost will go up overtime. There's dividend investors out there who are getting 10%+ yields on cost in shares in some high quality companies they've held for over 10+ years.

Given how high your dividend yield currently is, I'd suggest looking at companies with lower starting dividend yields, that have higher dividend growth rates. T for example is just going to keep on raising their dividend by 1 penny each year, which is about a 2% dividend raise, i.e. the average rate of inflation. Other companies like JNJ for example often raise their dividend by 5% or so each year, meaning 1) you'll be making more money each year even with inflation, 2) Overtime JNJ will eventually pay you a higher dividend yield then T.

I'm not saying to completely avoid T or other higher dividend yield companies, I'm just saying to have a balance between immediate dividend yield, and long term dividend growth potential.

That said, dividend investing will be slow for a while, but by reinvesting your increasing amount of dividends overtime you'll be able to build it up faster."

* Released the Model X.

* Released the best selling Model 3, in the previously stagnant luxury sedan market, and outsold every other luxury sedan combined. That is a huge success, especially with the profit margins on each 3 sold.

* Made profits in 3 of the last 5 quarters, and are on their way to have their first overall profitable year ever in 2020 (previously Tesla had only 2 profitable quarters). There's a big difference between money losing companies that are going to continue to lose big money, and money losers who are losing less money YoY, and getting closer to overall profitability.

* Built the China Gigafactory in under a year. China is the biggest automarket in the world (bigger than the US), so this is huge, especially with the 25% import duty previously on Tesla's sold in China.

* The Model Y (a more affordable model X) is set to be released in early 2020. Given the success of the Model 3, it'll likely be very successful, especially in the US where people love their SUV's more then sedans.

* They've brought down the cost of batteries (the biggest cost of an EV) significantly over the last 5 years. Experts on the subject think Tesla has a 3 to 4 year lead over their competitors at battery tech.

* The legacy automakers all agree that EV's are the future (as the tech is better, and governments of the world are pushing for it, especially China & EU, the 1st and 3rd largest auto markets). They're sinking billions into it for a reason.

* Experts on the EV tech have found that Tesla has a 3 to 4 year lead over all their competitors at the batteries. Tesla's batteries are simply cheaper to manufacturer, and get more range then their competitors (seriously, compare the battery weight and EV range of a Tesla and non-Tesla. You'll find Tesla's get more range then the non-Tesla's when the battery weights are equal). Battery tech is king in EV's, as batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. The inferior batteries of their competitors forces their competitors to either charge higher prices then Tesla, have less range then them, or lose money on each EV sold.

* There's a reason why Tesla is compared to Apple. They simply have a really good brand & product that creates a lot of rapid fans.

* Google the S curve of technological disruption. Essentially history has shown that adoption of new technologies (like smartphones) often **doesn't** follow a linear curve from 0 to 100%. Instead it starts out slow, until it reaches some 'critical mass' point, and then rapidly shoots up exponentially towards near 100% adoption in a short period of time. If you look at a chart of the history of then innovative disruption technologies (like the original automobile, refrigerators, smartphones) you'll see 1) They've all followed this S curve of adoption, and 2) more recent new technological disruptions (like the smartphones) have been adopted MUCH quicker than older technologies were. Due to how expensive cars are, EV's won't be beating the smartphone's adoption rate, but the S curve evidence says that mass EV adoption will likely happen a lot faster then you might think.

* Look up the history of smartphone adoption. Apple created the first one, and had a dominant market share in it at the beginning. As S curve adoption kicked in and new competitors came into the space Apple lost market share (as a percentage of the market), while still gaining a ton new customers. And yet because of their strong brand and quality products, Apple makes something like 80%+ of the profits in the smartphone manufacturer industry. This is why Tesla bulls are confident in Tesla even after competition finally gets here.

* Part of why the stock price is shooting up now is the media is fanning it, after previously fanning the ""Tesla is going bankrupt"" flames the Tesla shorts were pushing.I imagine Tesla will eventually correct itself, but where and down to what, who knows.

* What is a pair of smartglasses supposed to do better than a smartphone? There's a number of disadvantages to smart glasses I'll explain in the below points.

* From what I gather if you already wear glasses you have to get a custom pair of smart glasses with your eye prescription. This 1) isn't cheap (factoring in a visit to the eye doctor & the new glasses cost), 2) it often takes a week or two for the glasses lens to be made, and 3) your eyes and prescription change overtime, meaning you'd need to throw away a perfectly good device simply because your eyes change. And because it was customized just for you no one else could use it.

* If your prescription glasses are an electronic that needs charged, obviously you can't use your glasses while they're charging. Batteries in phones don't always last all day (especially on older phones, and if you're using very battery hungry apps).

* Wearing glasses **IS NOT** actually as comfortable or easy to adjust to as you might think if you've never worn glasses before. They need to be adjusted properly to rest right on your head (which can be a tricky process for some). For some people (especially those new to wearing glasses) even the tiniest smudge or bit of dust on their glasses will drive them crazy until they wash it off.

That said, unless you're multi-millionaire, I don't see why anyone looking to buy a new SUV would ever pick an ICE car with a $20,000 tax on it. Given how I keep my cars for 10+ years, I'd honestly be terrified that I wouldn't be able to find anywhere to refuel it in 5 to 10+ years time if the government is willing to put a $20,000 tax on ICE SUV's & trucks to speed up the EV transition."

stocks,fcquk5e,t1_fcnjvro,1577892420.0,"Technically federal legalization **wouldn't** legalize Marijuana nationwide. If you're not from the US, and don't know how our system of government works, you might not realize this.

Marijuana was long illegal at both the state & federal level. If the Federal government suddenly legalizes it that **doesn't** repeal Marijuana prohibition laws in states that still haven't legalized it.

Federal law may trump state law when there's a conflict between the two (so yes, marijuana is technically still illegal in the states that 'legalized' it, but the Federal government is creating a legally murky situation by not enforcing the law in those states). But it's long been established precedent that states can outlaws drugs on their own if they want. The Federal government would have to successfully sue the states to nullify their marijuana prohibition laws for it to truly be legal nationwide. While I'm not lawyer, I'm personally very dubious that such a lawsuit would go anywhere. I mean heck, there's a number of areas where the sale of alcohol is still illegal over a half a century after prohibition was repealed."

Large conglomerates have the problem of being difficult to value properly when they get too big and too diverse. But at the end of the day, regardless of it things like Youtube are a separate corporation owned by Google, or another division within one giant Google corporation, investors still have to understand it all in order to properly value Google as a whole."
stocks,fcoy6xy,t1_fcou7fe,1577844854.0,"Honestly, I still don't get why they did that. To this day pretty much everyone still calls them Google and not Alphabet, despite the name change occurring years ago.

You'd think that a company that's found to have the 2nd or 3rd most valuable brand in the world (depending upon who you ask, [Link](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/12/google-amazon-apple-among-100-most-valuable-brands-in-the-world/40279509/)) would want to stick that name on everything they own, not hide it on most of their products.

As stupid as it sounds, if I didn't know that Waymo was owned by Google I'd be much less likely to get into one of their self driving cars, because I have decades of trust in the Google brand, and none with the Waymo brand."

A number of state still 'ban' atheists from holding public office, even though the courts long ago struck that down (and would smack down any state who dared try to enforce it today)."
