thanksimcured,ffmg5do,t1_ffmey1i,1580054232.0,Damn i think you're right! Either way it cracked me up a few times. I wont be surprised if that post is running around somewhere in genuine Christian groups unfortunately.
thanksimcured,ffmftng,t1_ffm9amp,1580054090.0,I hate reading some replies people leave as condolences. How is telling someone about how God wanted a beautiful flower for his garden or something  going to make them feel better?
