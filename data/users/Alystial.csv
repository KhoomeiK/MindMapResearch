intermittentfasting,ffjq3mi,t3_etzo31,1580004093.0,"I do 20/4 with a 5:30-930 eating window. It's been almost a year and it works really well. Im rarely hungry during the day now and being able to decline office treats is an added bonus.  I replaced eating lunch with a daily walk,  so it's really enjoyable from all aspects."
intermittentfasting,ffj31ho,t1_ffiydek,1579989126.0,No problem. It's honestly such an overwhelming process when it comes to finding the right information!
fatlogic,ffj2ymj,t1_ffijjqf,1579989070.0,"Yeah this is kind of opposite my point. I was actually surprised by this metric in my results.  I spent most of my adult life being obese (227 lbs). Once I hit puberty, as my grandmother put it- I started looking porky. ""Oh well, being ""big boned"" runs in the family"" I was told.  For a long time,  and  lot of failed attempts, I thought that I was fighting against my genes.  

Yet these results suggest the complete opposite of that and further shows that lifestyle really is the biggest factor. There is no ""based on genetics"" here,  if there were I would have theoretically been ""naturally skinny"" or just slightly on the heavier side with lifestyle factored in, which was not the case at all. I realize what I'm saying is anecdotal, but I think it's pretty clear that weight is 100% lifestyle."
intermittentfasting,ffiuim1,t1_ffityhu,1579983056.0,I should also add that make sure to calculate your TDEE on sedentary as well even if you excercise.
intermittentfasting,ffiu9qg,t1_ffityhu,1579982879.0,"It's not. Subtract 500 cal per day to lose 1 lb/ week.  But at 400 lbs, you could safely do more like 1000 cal/ day deficit (2 lbs / week lost),  just know that as your size decreases,  so will your TDEE and then the 500 cal deficit will be a more sustainable option. Every 20 lbs lost or so,  recalculate TDEE."
intermittentfasting,ffituw5,t1_ffik55c,1579982582.0,"Yep.  Ordered pizza last night.  Scale is up .6 lbs today,  presumably extra water considering the high amount of sodium.

intermittentfasting,ffitjee,t3_etvblv,1579982351.0,Cronometer lets you do it manually.  Also I would suggest calculating your TDEE and going with their calorie recommendations to ensure you're at a deficit.
fatlogic,ffi6pur,t3_ets22v,1579966541.0,"I would bet good money that you, in fact,  do NOT eat 1800 cal/ day."
fatlogic,ffgfda8,t3_etgmzb,1579904986.0,I actually find it very helpful.  We're ordering pizza tonight and I learned that I can't eat more than 3 pieces of pizza if I want to keep my calorie deficit for today.
fatlogic,ffeyrei,t3_et76a7,1579870680.0,"I don't think this is so much fat logic as it is unrealistic expectations. In my experience, ""like typically dates like"". Obviously it does happen where you have an opposite attract scenario,  but typically ""birds of a feather flock together""."

There is no difference with this scenario than a recovering alcoholic seeing a picture of themselves drunk and expressing embarrassment and regret over that time in their life.  Being unhealthy doesn't feel good."

fatlogic,ffcu5j7,t3_esxa1y,1579807318.0,"The food examples are misleading. By showing that you need to eat 14 snickers or 6 big mac's to gain one lb, most people are not going to relate to that.  It fails to show the correlation between energy burned vs energy consumed.

 The overall message of this info graphic is that average is ok, *eventhough* that height and weight for a female is OVERWEIGHT, fat isn't that bad and oh look,  you'd need to eat six burgers to gain anything.  It feeds right into fat logic perfectly."

You might be able to persuade a slim person who has never struggled with their weight that it's genetics, set points, PCOS, slow metabolisms etc.  But those of us who have been there,  struggled and finally committed to changing and succeeded- you can't fool us.  We *know* the reason you're fat is because you eat too much, so of course we're your worst enemy because we know the truth."
fatlogic,ff7wtoe,t1_ff6u08n,1579660238.0,The point still remains that BMI is *only* flawed when it comes to persons who are fit and muscular. It's not flawed the other direction which is my point.  The people who would be wise to follow to the BMI recommendations are the ones on their soap box spouting about its inaccuracies.
loseit,ff7jcqe,t3_es35jw,1579650919.0,"Good news! Its likely the excercise. You just started a new routine,  and often when this happens the body will retain water.  So stick to your deficit and your workout and be patient!

intermittentfasting,feppqy0,t3_eqbmju,1579327216.0,"Real talk: it takes awhile to adapt. You'll have good days and some bad.  It took me about 6-8 weeks to get to the point where I felt totally normal (energized even) when I was fasting. 

Some tips:

Water, water, water!  

Remember that hunger pangs are fleeting and that they do not get more severe the longer into your fast you get.  They just *are*. So, if you've got them coming at you in a fierce way,  get busy.  Go for a walk,  do a chore, etc. 

Don't underestimate electrolytes in the beginning.  I don't need them anymore,  but in the beginning I was adding pink Himalayan salt to my water with each refill and taking magnesium citrate every evening- this helped significantly with headaches and the super tired/ groggy feeling I'd get coming into to the end of my fast.  

Lastly,  just understand that your body is adapting to a lot of changes right now and that takes a little time.  It does get sooooo much easier. Im almost a year in now, and it doesn't phase me at all,  but the first month or two definitely took some discipline and just pushing through."

It was the calorie reduction from the IF that resulted in weightloss. So my response is usually ""calorie restriction. I started tracking my food and eating less than I burn"".

intermittentfasting,femun0j,t1_fem00or,1579270053.0,"Not necessarily.  I tend to agree with this advice,  but 10 days is too little amount of time to make that assessment.

You don't necessarily need to be rigid from here going forward with the calorie counting- you can use it for a few days to get a baseline and learn what's putting you over.

intermittentfasting,fek9mt8,t3_eplt8h,1579195483.0,"I think the other factor worth noting,  is that all of Patrick's knowledge is based on Satchin Panda's work which is on circadian fasting.  

Circadian fasts are quite a bit different from what is practiced on this sub.  In a circadian fast, the fast is a max of 16 hours,  with Satchin referring to the ""sweet spot"" for metabolic benefits to be a 9 hour eating window. Circadian fasts also require that the eating times are during daylight hours to align with circadian rhythm. 

So all that said,  I am a fan of Patrick's work,  but when she talks about fasting,  she largely ignores that most people practicing IF are fasting for 16+ hours. 

And I agree,  much more research is needed,  especially peer reviewed,  controlled human trials."

This idea of self regulation via hunger cues works really well on tiny humans.  But at some point,  through bad habits and a ""you *need* to eat mentally"" we wind up overriding those hunger cues and we need to actively restrict what we eat to reset those hunger cues.

 There's a large body of evidence pointing to increased leptin and grehlin in obese people,  meaning the cues your super smart body is sending you,  is actually incorrect and purely the result of years of overeating.  Calorie restriction and time restricted eating actually look some what promising in reducing these hormone levels,  suggesting that,  in order to get your body to a place where you can listen to your hunger cues,  you need to practice restriction first."

The key is to make sure you're still in a calorie deficit.  I always factor my alcohol calories in to my target,  so it's never really been an issue.

I wear at Fitbit,  and if I ate at the suggested ""deficit"", I wouldn't have lost anything. 

You can calculate your TDEE on sedentary (https://tdeecalculator.net/), then subtract 500 cal from this number, which allows for a calorie deficit that should yield 1 lb loss per week. 

Also, if you're not using a food scale,  I reccomend that as well.
