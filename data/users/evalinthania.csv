asktransgender,fcb78cd,t3_egweex,1577583268.0,"Like, The Cis, The Straights, The Men, The Whites, and such are things people say to punch up and help empower themselves. In no way has it ever actually harmed any group en masse/systematically the way they harm by punching down. You're essentially saying punching up should be looked down on. Like... why??? Respectability politics????"
