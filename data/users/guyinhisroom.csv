college,ff354ti,t3_er2k2d,1579533909.0,"If you have a solid plan to follow instead of college, then do that. College is a load of BS in most cases. Just explain to your parents your reasons why you think it would be better to join the police academy and if they have a problem with it then that's their problem."

I took a machine learning class last semester though, and I was wondering whether we'll eventually just be able to give an AI all of our stems and then have it produce the best possible mix based on millions of other mixes that it has analyzed. I'm sure we'll eventually be able to do that, but I wonder if it'll be sooner than we think."
college,feh76ih,t1_feh58e7,1579110569.0,Yup. I'm planning on moving South after graduation because I refuse to live half of every year like this for the rest of my life.
college,fegzpzc,t3_eo5gcl,1579106103.0,"I'm going into my final semester of college and the last few years have been very difficult, but I'm glad to have suffered through them. I know quite a few people who have not had a great time in college. You're not alone. Just invest in building yourself up in this time and think of it as a hero's journey where you are enduring suffering so that you can achieve a better life for yourself."
college,fegze9l,t3_eomxga,1579105903.0,"If you have an interest in CS then go for it. It's a pretty damn difficult major, but at the same time it is probably the best bang-for-your-buck in terms of time invested vs salaries (you can make 6 figures out of college)."
college,fegz6tn,t3_eou9m1,1579105777.0,"Think about your actual reasons for going to college. If you are going for a major that you don't think will benefit you, and you think that you would be better suited working towards something else besides college, then go for that. However, if you are going towards a major that you think will benefit your life greatly after graduation, then keep that in mind and you will be able to push through any suffering that comes your way. Trust me, I understand. I'm studying computer science and the last few years have been the most difficult of my life, but I am really glad that I stuck with it and I will be finishing soon. I actually nearly dropped out the first year."

college,fegytai,t3_eow0xd,1579105546.0,"Lots of people drop out or transfer during or after the first year. You need to learn how to be adaptive and independent, so this may actually be a good thing. Join a club or organization. Go to lots of events. Go outside your comfort zone to meet people and you will find that you will emerge a much stronger person."

college,fegyghu,t3_eovpy3,1579105325.0,"You need to learn how to be independent and alone. It's okay to be sad about your friend leaving, but things usually don't go how they were planned, so you need to adapt to your new circumstances and figure out how you can make the best of it. I'd join a club/organization."

college,fegy37y,t3_ep2kt3,1579105095.0,"I'd bring your laptop, a notebook, and writing materials. You probably won't do much for the first week though. I would not buy the textbook unless the instructor specifically says that all of the work will be done in the book and that it is absolutely essential. Even then, search online to try to find a free pdf of it because many times if you just type ""<textbook name> pdf"" then you will get a free pdf as the first result."

People are also always backstabbing one another. Not saying that I'm never egotistical, but I've gotten much better since starting meditation and learning more about how to be self-awareness in general."

It's not about winning a match, it's about getting to the best outcome for all. We're all in this together you dumbasses."
AskAnAmerican,fdjz5qi,t1_fdj5m09,1578491953.0,Its so fucked up how the media nowadays focuses more on sending people into hysterics than it does on giving people accurate and well thought-out information.

AskMen,fd2mmhs,t1_fd0lt92,1578149382.0,The only bars I generally enjoy going to as a more introverted person are bars with live music. I think it's a good alternative to the standard bar if you are introverted because there's something obvious to talk about with people and a lot of the people are more introverted.
AskMen,fd2lytw,t3_ehmkp5,1578149118.0,"The good: Started learning music production and released some tracks. Also, played my first full set of original music with my band. Finally found a good living situation in my senior year of school and I am good friends with my roommate.

The bad: Parents constantly arguing whenever I am home."
college,fd2jyu4,t3_ejveqg,1578148314.0,"Take this time to focus on bettering yourself. You will probably end up making friends if you work on building a life that is fun even all alone.
