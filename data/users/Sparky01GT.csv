Music,ffhg0t5,t1_ffhfaqb,1579933673.0,"I mean I didn't pull it out of my butt. It's even on their wiki page. I'm not a fan of trying to divide music up into a bunch of subjective little sub genres though. Even then, one album or song by a band may fit one genre and another album or song may not."
Music,ffhem24,t1_ffhebdm,1579932065.0,"Lol, that is some serious splitting of hairs. Stoner but DEFINITELY not groove? Lol"
Music,ffhebhd,t1_ffhe50f,1579931748.0,I think Nola is a banger from start to finish.
Music,ffh9w3o,t1_ffh9k93,1579927367.0,"Yeah, looks like the rest of the lineup hasn't changed."
Music,ffh9fca,t1_ffh98g0,1579926948.0,"Was. It's a guy named Patrick Bruder now, who was previously in Crowbar. I didn't know either until I looked at the wiki before i posted to make sure I knew what I was talking about."
Music,ffh8x8x,t1_ffgrisp,1579926507.0,"Check out a band called Down, it is a supergroup with Phil from Pantera and guys from other great bands. They qualify as groove metal I think."
GameStop,ffh7ybr,t1_ffh4tm2,1579925677.0,What games are actually on the floor at GameStop?
gaming,ffecgt3,t1_ffe4k7w,1579843047.0,"Except you can use the gift card to buy digital currency, like Steam, or PS/Xbox. Of which they don't see a dime."
gaming,ffec7ph,t1_ffe4etl,1579842815.0,I'm pretty sure you can't trade in more than 4 of the same SKU.
relationship_advice,ff8bxhn,t3_erzvnf,1579672319.0,"Well, you've certainly got the upper hand here. i would just hold tight until she realizes she's got your face on her back and her options are limited, lol."
trashy,ff88ln5,t3_es06zv,1579669167.0,I can't believe someone in HR signed that garbage
whatisthisthing,ff6ovcx,t1_ff6o8vq,1579631793.0,"Excellent question. If I had to guess, it's because she was too tired to bang the 2 or 3 guys she might have ran into on the way there."
sports,ff5dquh,t3_eroqwh,1579588605.0,"I think it's awesome! Gender and sexual preference have nothing to do with your ability to teach, and she is proving it. I just wish that commercial with her yelling ""Let's go, run it again. Run it again, let's go"" hadn't basically ruined her for me."
metroidvania,ff1tntq,t3_er1h0s,1579485930.0,The newly rumored 2D Metroid supposedly coming this year. I kick-started Monster Sanctuary and that should be coming out this year.
whenitgoesin,ff1sd4z,t1_fezukl8,1579485110.0,Yup. Looks close enough for my purposes.
whatisthisthing,ff0lf64,t1_ff0jqie,1579469963.0,"Not very long by that point. And not much longer afterwards. It wasn't the normal ""don't want to poop in front of the new love"", this was whacky. She did the same with regular bathrooms.  She was also terrified of birds, which if you've been to key West, it's not a great  place for that, lol."
whatisthisthing,fezzlkp,t1_fezlodg,1579463593.0,"I stayed at a hotel in Key West where the bathroom ""door"" was a set of those ""saloon style"" swinging doors, didn't go all the way to the floor or the ceiling. And my girlfriend at the time was terrified of me ever hearing her do any bathroom stuff.  She woke me from a dead sleep at 3am to leave the room so she could take a leak."
AskReddit,feyjd68,t1_feww15l,1579446253.0,"It was a pop culture reference and corny joke for over a decade. The flashing zeros on your vcr, etc."
snes,fepm0xm,t3_eq7aph,1579324050.0,Hard to go back to that one after playing Super or Turbo though. It feels like it's moving at half speed.
gamecollecting,fepltz8,t1_feph05c,1579323899.0,I don't think this was an option back when I did mine. I used ActionReplay. Which also comes with an SD to memory card adapter.
gamecollecting,fem224h,t1_fem1xrh,1579237204.0,"Also a couple strange ones like Contact and Electroplankton.  I like to collect offbeat games. Even if I never play them, I like have a collection that's not just the same stuff as everyone else. That's what I like about yours too."
