Fighting the politicians is just fighting the symptoms. The disease is the people's voting habits.

Instead of telling them you get anxiety, since they might not have a good understanding of what that's like. But everyone understands pain, and people don't want to cause others pain, generally. So I find it's a quick way to short-circuit the conversation. 

Me: ""please don't touch me""

Them: ""why?""

Me: ""Because it causes me physical pain, there's nothing I can do about it, it doesn't matter who touches me.""

80% of the time, that above phrase is enough to stop people dead in their tracks from touching me. Even if it's not the whole truth, it's usually enough to get them to stop. And if it's a person you might want to touch you eventually, you can give them a more in-depth explanation. 

The 20% that don't listen is still a problem though. I've broken down crying so many times because people refuse to respect my request for them not to touch me.

And if you can't tell the difference between the political parties, you're severely underinformed. There's a million miles of difference between them.

We can also tell what bills came from what parties more than 95% of the time because they are so so different. 

But uniformed people such as yourself can't see that. You only have a surface understanding of the parties, so they seem the same to you.

But I imagine someone with more knowledge of sports will find my comment laughable.

aww,fdigkut,t1_fdi3290,1578442430.0,"> with a randomized timer

Not with randomized timers he doesn't. They don't create the superposition necessary for Schrödinger's thought experiment to be valid. You need to have an unstable isotope on the verge of emitting some form of radiation.

The thought experiment isn't about it being random. Rather, he was making fun of the concept of superposition. I'm simplifying everything, but you can have an atom that simultaneously released radiation and did not release radiation. Both scenarios are equally valid and can be described as happening simultaneously. Schrödinger's cat asked what if that superposition can go beyond the atom and encompass a detector, a vial of poison, a box, and a cat inside that box. If superposition was an accurate reflection of reality, than it would mean the cat inside the box is alive AND dead at the exact same time. Both realities are equally true. And the superposition only collapses to just one reality when you open it. (And another question is, when you open the box and find the cat alive, was another universe just created where you found it dead? Where does the other reality go when the superposition collapses? Since it was just as valid as the reality you observe.)

So you see, it's not at all about randomness. Randomness doesn't matter, and a random timer wouldn't do it. You need a process that uses quantum mechanics so a superposition can be created. Although in reality, the detector would collapse the superposition so you could never get one this large. But it's a fun ""what if"" scenario that really makes you realize how weird the universe actually is."

At least there doesn't appear to be any differences to me, someone who never watches any sports at all and can't name a single player from anything. But to a sports fan, I imagine my opinion is laughable. That's how ""both sides are the same"" people sound. It's like they're saying, ""all ball/net based sports are exactly the same!"""

Science starts with a lot of explanations but that all come down to one as we get closer to the truth. 

Fictional stories start with one explanation but usually grow to many explanations as new authors add to the story and expand things. 

Fact goes from many possibility to one truth. Fiction goes from one possibility to many. Funny enough, religion acts just like a fictional story and not anything like a fact. 

Also, sorry to hear what happened to you. Shit sucks, but you survived and you can ensure any kids you may have will never experience the horrors you have.

And when you do this from inside a mission, you don't have to pay any of the business fees.

The nightclub is the best to do this with as it has recharge times that can take up to 36 hours. Doing it once every 24 hours nets you more money than waiting the full time though. But when you need to own businesses to buy the nightclub. But as long as you own one business and the nightclub, you can use it to make money while afk. Then use the money it makes you to buy more businesses and upgrading the nightclub. It takes a while, but the actual work required is like 10 minutes a day."

gaming,fc1rfts,t1_fc1p6dc,1577327358.0,"This is called the [Null Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis) and is the backbone of all of science. For any given proposition, the default assumption is null. To put that in another way, assume every factual claim you ever hear is false, until you get evidence otherwise. That's why the burden of proof isn't on the person saying a claim is wrong. Because that's the default position. It doesn't require proof, for obvious reasons. 

You can't prove a thing doesn't exist. I could say I have a dragon in my backyard, according to you, refuting my claim requires evidence. So what evidence can you collect to disprove my claim about a dragon being in my backyard? Well you could look, but my dragon is invisible. Well you could feel for it, but my dragon can walk through walls. You could see if it eats anything, but my dragon doesn't need food. And so on. You see the problem? Suddenly every claim is true, and any attempt to disprove them can be explained away. 

That's why we have the null hypothesis. I claim I have a dragon in my backyard, the default position you take is null, or no I don't and you ask me for evidence. What was once impossible to disprove now is impossible to prove as I have no dragon to get evidence from. 

Just think of all the crazy things you've heard that can't actually be disproven, but obviously aren't true. The Harry Potter books actually being a documentary is my favorite. (I mean, that's why she can't make anything else good, and keeps messing up the canon. She just recorded what happened!)"

> so I'm gonna use it as e-money

That's just so weird to me. I always thought of it as a dragon's hoard thing. And never thought it can actually be ""spent."" It's just a giant pile of crap not usable to you, for you to look at and say, ""yup I have that."" Anything else, including thinking you can ""spend"" it, just feels like you're giving it too much thought. 

But I guess we all view karma differently ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
