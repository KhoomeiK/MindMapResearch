Posture,ffvmgv8,t1_ffvlddo,1580267598.0,"So I didn't mean that I was asking about TOS or scap winging and that the nervous system stuff was just a side note. The nervous system component is big. Say you do have scap winging and TOS, those are just words that describe a cluster of physical characteristics. It doesn't describe the mechanisms contributing to your issues. That's why I asked about the nervous system stuff. Dominant sympathetic nervous system, chest breathing, neck & upper shoulder tension are all tied together and can reinforce each other. I'm suggesting that you take a look at your SYSTEM. How far you get will be limited with standard MD's because they're usually looking to diagnose a localized THING, or at least just know when to refer to a physio. A good physio would be able to help, as long as they spend enough time with you. What I'm talking about isn't an issue of strength or lack of strength, it's the coordination of your lifestyle and nervous system.

Any kind of exercise is a stressor; the more intense, the more of a toll.

How is the quality of your rest? How much time do you *actually* spend genuinely relaxed?

Do you ever take some time to belly breathe in a relaxed position, or do you spend most of your time breathing with your upper chest & neck? When you say your back is strong, does that include your mid/low traps? And no scapular winging? (or do you have scap winging along with your forward head/shoulders?)

When you're at the top, not only are you flexing your hips but you also have to find that balance point. Maybe you're using your glutes to help find that balance point, maybe you perceive that you'd tip over if you piked anymore.. something like that might make your hamstrings less willing to stretch.

You are supposed to let your core relax when you belly breath. Belly breathing is a way to tell your nervous system that you're not in any danger right now, that you're free to let your muscles and body relax.

It's not that chest breathing is WRONG-- it's definitely appropriate when you NEED to maintain core integrity but still be able to breath lol (like when you're exercising). If you try to belly breath with an engaged core, you won't be able to take a deep inhale with your diaphragm."

flexibility,ffrl5r4,t3_eusuvt,1580160292.0,"This is pretty common! The stress component of tightness would benefit a lot from doing more somatic-type work.

Things like finding a position, not necessarily a STRETCH, that seems to feel like it feels RIGHT at the time.

Some people have trouble tuning in to their bodies enough to feel tightness or when something feels right-- a lot of us have learned a very ""mind over matter"" approach and have powered through the messages being sent from our bodies to the point that the only messages that get through are basic needs like hunger, thirst, going to the bathroom, etc.

Shoulders are def a common issue going from sitting at a desk to working out, especially overhead work! It's the most mobile joint in the body, which means there are a lot of ways its mechanics can get thrown off.

What I've seen a lot of, is that we're so used to controlling our arms with our necks & upper chest/shoulders in a forward position, that it takes away from our ability to connect with the other parts of our shoulders. The neck & upper chest also work a lot because people tend to only ever chest-breath, instead of connecting to the diaphragm and letting that muscle do the breathing once in a while.

The silver lining is that improving the way you move your shoulder, will ultimately increase your potential for training! It's a big up-front investment, but totally worth it."

beginnerfitness,ffrbs8d,t3_euqfvc,1580154776.0,"Hey there--

You should take 1 full day off once a week from your evening routine. Right now, there's no time for your body to recover. Eventually, you'd get to the point where you're in the red when you start; injuries are always the weakest link so you run the risk of one of your old injuries flaring up.

Lastly, don't go by how you perceive the intensity that you're working at.

Partner acro is THE HARDEST for me. I have trouble staying tight in one independent little open-chain bubble, and being manhandled (lol literally) wasn't helping.

For silks, try not to do too much sinking in to your passive flex, especially if you have to wrestle your way out of it. For things like drops, make sure you know them realllyyyyy fucking well. For things that involve momentum, try to work on each individual part without any dynamic component first. In general, make sure you're stabilization appropriately, especially shoulders-- don't sink into things like your back rounding, going ragdoll, etc. (Anyway, stabilization is how people look effortless!)

Anyway-- work on increasing your movement efficiency! For a lot of people, that means things like... knowing how to use your deep core to stabilize your pelvis & spine so that other muscles are free to do their jobs, i.e., moving parts of your body! Can you stabilize your pelvis enough so that your hip flexors have a strong anchor to pull on? Do you know how to isolate the movement of your legs in your hips, instead of dragging the pelvis along? (like butt winks when you're squatting & a good hip hinge) Do you know how to re-distribute the load of your breathing, or do you only breathe with your chest and upper neck? Do you know how to stabilize your shoulders and maximize the use of all your shoulder stabilizers, so that your arms aren't hanging off your neck?

I will def try and put up a post on training with hypermobility! And really, I appreciate it but no need for gold, I'm satisfied enough when it genuinely helps people :)  I've been thinking about it anyways, but I guess the main thing stopping me is that I know we all have different degrees of hypermobility and I would feel so bad if it were exclusionary. I will try & come up with something!"
Hypermobility,ffqv86d,t1_ffq70dm,1580144401.0,"I actually do more Pilates and bodyweightfitness-related training (circus arts).

In addition to training, recovering & eating enough protein-- for hypermobility, you may want to check out videos of Functional Range Conditioning (also associated with Kinstretch). It's not that their work is _unique_, it's just that it's nicely packaged. They work on developing end-range control. I haven't done the FRC training, but several friends have.

Pilates is similar in that the focus is on control, maximizing your stabilization in the appropriate places, moving from the appropriate places, all for the sake of movement efficiency.

There are more general versions of this type of work; it usually gets lumped under ""mobility training"". Also, working on returning balance to areas-- like if you have forward shoulders from sitting a lot.

Lastly! Because our joints are so loose, our nervous systems tend to keep areas of our muscles clenched. We actually have a lot of muscle tightness, but because other structures give way when we stretch, it LOOKS like we're still flexible and not tight. Mobility tools like foam rollers, massage balls, peanuts are suupeerrr helpful. They will buy you some time because its effects aren't permanent, so I usually like doing it before a mobility workout. Check out cirquephysio on IG-- actually, she's doing a hypermobility series! Her typical content targets circus artists, which involves a lot of moving at end ranges (like going into the splits) but she advocates for ACTIVE work, so it's totally stuff applicable for us too, since we already have that range. We gotta learn how to own it!"
bodyweightfitness,ffqo7vg,t1_ffqmz4b,1580139735.0,"Well, I will say that shoulder impingement is somewhat common in people who have tight shoulders that go into things like too much overhead work without enough technique and/or too much volume

The rehab for that takes however long it needs to build better movement patterns. It’d prob be a minimum of 6-8 weeks (think it took me a few months, I can’t remember) but on the bright side, this is a chance to improve your potential!"
