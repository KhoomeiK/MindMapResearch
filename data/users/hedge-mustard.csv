EDAnonymous,ffe2ffl,t1_ffe25ek,1579834940.0,"Though I obviously cannot officially diagnose you, that sounds like body dysmorphia - I can almost guarantee you that at a BMI of 15 you look underweight (edit: this is *not* a good thing!) - and besides, appearance is no guarantee of health. If you are underweight, you are not healthy, especially if you have become that severely underweight through disordered eating habits. Another thing to keep in mind is that people with EDs often have a level of denial about the severity of their problem, which is another component of the disorder."

I hate to be the person who says it *just requires discipline*, but it’s true. You have to be ready to make the changes you want to, and you have to be ready to commit to sticking to them even when there are bumps in the road. If you’re relapsing the next day, that’s not putting it behind you. Diet changes are really lifestyle changes, which are unfortunately very hard (for anyone!) to make.

KindVoice,ff13idq,t3_eqzmlm,1579474812.0,"Hitting rock bottom means you’ve finally found solid footing. You might not have anything, but you know what you don’t have that you want to have. There are things in your life that you enjoy and still find worthwhile. Even the most mundane things like cheap coffee can bring you warmth and comfort. 

Having a degree in the arts means that you have the discipline required to get a college degree, even if the title of your degree isn’t “applicable” to many job postings. You have the skills to work hard at a job, whether if it’s menial tasks or skilled labor. If McDonald’s didn’t hire you, then it’s their loss and the Burger King down the street will be happy to have you. 

The fact that your situation upsets you and makes you stressed out signifies that you do very much enjoy living, because you want a better life than what your life is right now. Furthermore, it’s clear that you are capable of and willing to work for the life that you want.

Plan ahead for what’s to come - save what you can, apply for jobs, look ahead for temporary housing that can get you through this time until you can get settled. Keep in mind that there’s only so much planning one can do before it overtakes their every waking thought and becomes unproductive and unbearable. Take comfort in the small things that you can, and cherish them. Tough times will inevitably get better; spring will always follow winter, and we just have to keep chopping firewood in the meantime until it comes. 

Last, please stick around to see it get better. I’d miss you missing it."
