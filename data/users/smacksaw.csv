UBI is a huge deal because it allows us to streamline government. Bernie has to listen to people who want a leaner, meaner government, but still *want* effective government.

askcarsales,ffpngjp,t3_euc453,1580099511.0,"All I can say is this:

Say shit goes sideways with your car. The dealership who sold it to you has more of an incentive to keep a relationship with you. 

I had a Ram that was a lemon and it would just die in traffic. Wherever I was in the GVRD, they would only tow it to the nearest dealership. This happened over 100 times (no lemon laws in Canada), so I got to know every single dealership in Vancouver quite well. Hell, the people at the 800 # knew me by my voice and kept my VIN written down. That bad.

Carter Dodge in Burnaby fought like mad for me. I didn't buy it from them. They forced Chrysler to send someone from Windsor to come figure out what in the fuck was wrong with that POS.

Destination, who I bought it from? Could not have given two fucks less. Management changed and I was a nobody to them after that.

Maple Ridge? They sucked ass. Total shitshow.

Langley? Fucking clueless. Both dealerships there. Same with Richmond. Both of them. 

Marine and Eagle Ridge? Both were great. 

Let me put it to you like this: if you don't want to buy from a local dealer, chances are you don't want to get it serviced, there, either. Incompetence is institutional. 

Funny story, when I broke down in Bellingham, there was a Jeep-only dealer and they were the one who best took care of me to get me back home. When I got a Liberty (also a lemon), they really helped me quite a bit. 

Just depends on the dealership."

If you're going to get a nice case, don't go half-assed like he did.

Spend up and get glass panels. 

Seriously, plexiglass cases are way overpriced and once you've reached a certain price threshold, you're better off spending up and getting one that has real glass panels. Not only that, they have much better cages, better airflow, etc. 

Like for me, there's cases under $50 and then ones over $150. I mean, more or less, YMMV and sales/rebates, but you get the point.

A $100 case is basically a hoopty $30 case a lot of times, but a $150+ case is a marvel of engineering and quality materials.

It's like saying we should get rid of prayer because it doesn't heal cancer.

Prayer is just part of a holistic organism. It's there to give people strength in times of need. 

Science is there to save people.

Capitalism has become a philosophy, a dogma, a religion, a way of life.

Capitalism is just a tool. And until someone comes up with a better tool, it's the default.

But it isn't the raison d'etre. Capitalism is like science or prayer in that organism. It has it's role. Sometimes it's the primary role. People need to eat. And sometimes it needs to take a back seat. People need clean air and water. 

I see very little difference between people who worship slavishly at the altar of capitalism and the people who blame it for all ills in the world. 

Capitalism is like a knife. In the hands of a psychopath, it's murderous. In the hands of an artist, it carves the most beautiful woodworking. In the hands of a child, it cuts their food into pieces. 

You can use the knife for whatever you want. Don't blame the knife. Blame the psychopaths at the top abusing capitalism, communism, socialism or any other ism.
