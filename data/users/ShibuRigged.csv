This is what's important here. Unintentional weight loss is a cardinal sign for things like cancer, depression, autoimmune/GI diseases, etc. It is a red flag. I don't disagree with what was originally posted. If it was something like an FA posting about how you should never compliment weight loss, sure. But there's none of that context here and people should be aware of the above, because they can all contribute to unintentional weight loss and are important things to look out for"

Like, I'm going to be a bit more pragmatic than most in that I am aware there is a separation between the two types of law. Because they're related but not the same thing. But a 17-year-old is still a child. Even if they are 17 and 364 days old, they are not conferred the rights of adulthood and being treated as full adult until they are 18.

Similarly, when he’s off season, or now that he’s moved on, his bf% is clearly around 10-12% with clear definition, but some fluff.

On its own, yeah. A low mood doesn’t indicate depression. Especially when it is in short bouts. But combined with other things, it tends towards a diagnosis of depression. This is not to take away from your mood, I’m just repeating clinical criteria.

I don't want to pry but unless the thing that was withheld was something truly necessary for healthy development then they really need to let it go.

It's not insensitive at all. I've told him this plenty of times that it's petty as fuck because it's the past and it's done, he gets defensive, and that also leads to projecting through his kids by spoiling them to the point they can sometimes be out of control and then heavy handedly trying to rescind it when they invariably go wild (combined with those high expectations and it leads to the venting and mental health issues my nephews already have that I touched on earlier). I don't really care at this point because that's how he is. But just shows that kids can and will hold on to these things, for decades, well into adulthood, and across generations. By comparison, I had a very fulfilling childhood, am arguably the most successful person in my family, have the healthiest relationship with my parents to the point where I'm the only one that has cheeky banter with them, and that's what has partly informed my views. Whereas my brother is still bitter as fuck about perceived injustices as a child, even when he got a paid private education vs my borderline state school. My brother's wife said I'm like a hero to my now 8 and 10 year old nephews of this brother. And that's because I was the uncle they had something in common with, an adult they had some degree of parity with and understanding of things they're interested in and to the point where they listened to me more than my older brother and his wife. They do as I say because there's some degree of mutual respect. Lauding over somebody as an unreasonable totem does not command respect.

> Nothing he said suggests that he's trying to keep his kids from learning about Fortnight. 

OP has said he thinks it is inappropriate and by 'enforcing PEGI ratings', Fortnite is PEGI12 and by enforcing the rating, they're banning them from it, which is fine, but the kids have obviously got a problem with it, otherwise there would be no need for OP to vent here. OP's going about it in the same way a lot of parents do with things they do not understand and that's by banning it from the small realm they control, which is mostly ineffective. I know it's ineffective because I have seen it personally and you see it time and time again online. The kids will continue to complain and play it elsewhere. OP is just pieing off having to deal with it themselves by banning it in the tiny area they have control of. They're venting here because this is their outlet. And when you take a step back, these are the ages that kids go to friends houses quite often, so they're not doing anything by banning it.

They talk about the other activities they're doing, and if they were frequent and fulfilling enough, there would again, be no reason to post this in the first place. From experience with other branches of my family, particularly with middle-class children than have full timetables and that do lots of activities that are not screen based and almost always **with** their parents, tend not to care because the parents are extremely pragmatic and proactive with getting involved with their kids lives and activities. They barely know these things exist because there simply isn't time for it.

>I'm also not sold on the idea that just because there friends play it they should be allowed to as well. 

That's fine, but that obviously isn't working for the OP. The kids are obviously nagging at him, otherwise again, he would not need to make this post at all. Give them a worthy substitute and they won't nag. There would be no need to make this type of post. Actively engage with them, but in a pragmatic way so they don't feel as if it's unfair with it being taken away from them so they get their dose of Fortnite, and are satisfied with it. There is no need for this post. Tell them why you don't want them playing Fortnite or why it isn't appropriate for them in a way they can understand and at the very least, they won't nag to the point it's intolerable.

With regards to OP's kids. They've been exposed to Fortnite anyway. It's done. Hiding away and complete restriction from it is not going to do jack shit because they will play at other people's houses and potentially grow resentful because of it. One of my siblings still resents my parents for stuff they had taken from them, that other kids had, at the age of 4, and this is someone closing in on their 40s. Similarly, my nephews have shown signs of growing resent at being restricted in ways that other kids seemingly aren't. At this point, it's just talking to your kids and telling them why you don't want them playing in a way the kids understand (OP hasn't done this, otherwise there would be no problem and the kids would not care about Fortnite and this post would never have existed), or finding a way to get them to play it in controlled exposure, so while you may not find it entirely appropriate, you make it appropriate as possible. The cat is out of the bag, pretending it doesn't exist won't work. Controlling and managing it, will. Carpet banning them at home won't work at this point because it is perceived as being unfair. But it is perfectly possible in managing a kid's expectations and talking them out of something, especially if you have a replacement activity, which again, OP does not if Fortnite is a problem for all their claims; it would not be a problem if it was adequately substituted. I also know plenty of kids, from another branch of my family, with whom games like Fortnite are not a problem because the kids have extremely full timetables in other ways.

They've obviously not done this, otherwise they would not be posting here to vent. Their kids obviously have a problem with playing Fortnite, and OP's probably had a recent issue with them playing longer than they're allowed to or complaining about it, especially with them mentioning other parents and their children having different rules. So I wouldn't be shocked if the kid(s) pulled out the old ""BUT SO AND SO'S PARENTS LET THEM"" chestnut, as kids always do, that led to this post and OP mentioning other families. If they weren't having problems, they would not be venting.  OP has responded in the same way many parents do, by saying something to the effect of ""I don't care what other people do, my house, my rules"""

These people don't give a fuck, many think they're above the law or their minor infractions aren't worthy of punishment, probably because ""everyone else does it too"" or something like that.

It's like people who speed and think it's their right because of the above and because ""I have a job to get to"", as if they are the only employed person in the country."
britishproblems,fexntst,t1_fexmyfd,1579433718.0,"Because some kids walk to and from school. Sometimes kids play outside and not in sight. Sometimes, a kid might need to get in touch with you because there is an emergency. Sometimes that grandparent, friend, uncle, whatever, may be a bit more lax than you would like them to be. Sometimes things take longer than they should and you might start to worry. 

Being able to ping their location doesn't affect their life. Having a way to call them isn't a big impact either. Giving them something to look after and knowing that gadgets aren't disposable isn't the worst thing to do.

Although, I will say that one caveat to this is that it's probably counter-productive for over-protective parents that will panic ping their kids every 30 seconds and has the potential to cause a lot of anxiety in the wrong people. It's a nice failsafe if you're mentally sound."
britishproblems,fexlmgv,t1_fexkqzo,1579433011.0,"Not at all. I meant like forcing them to do activities think should be fun because you wish you'd done it when you were younger, instead of partaking. Like a parent who screams at their kids to do something ""fun"" because they found it ""fun"" when they were younger and don't have an understanding of why kids don't like things, because it isn't of their generation, or because they suck at it and most people tend not to like something until they are good at it. You get involved, you learn why they like something and try to enjoy it with them. When you're involved, it doesn't feel like as much of a big deal to tell them to stop when you are also stopping with them. When trying something new, telling them to enjoy it doesn't mean as much as showing them why you enjoy it or how they can get better with some patience and learn to enjoy it. And if you want an absolute restriction, explain to them why instead of taking it away from them. Like, it's not hard to tell a kid why you don't want them to play or watch something if you've actually tried to understand why they want to play or watch it in the first place.

I have three nephews, two of whom I spent a lot of time with when they were in the 3-8 age range. Funnily, they respected me a lot more than their parents, vented to me about their mental health issues (which no kid should have, but they did because their parents were viewed as oppressors that were unfair and unreasonable and how that made them want to run away and disappear) due to the pressures they were having from their parents. It was never a chore for me to look after them because they were involved with me from playing games, to cooking, or even if I had to do something like rugby training, they came with and I got them involved. Even with shit they didn't want to do, they didn't mind so much because there was some degree of parity and if they had to do something they didn't want to do, I let them know of something I had to give up; which fit in with a recent study that was shared on r/science that detailed that children get an understanding of what is and is not fair at around the age of 4-6. Even when I had my nephews' friends around, not a problem, because again, I was actively involved with their interests, managed restrictions by showing them I was giving up something to, for some sense of parity and still managed to show them new things."
britishproblems,fexjow4,t1_fexf59x,1579432083.0,"Or you know, engage with your kids. It gives you something to bond over, for a start. Then knowing that you're playing with them, it gives them a tangible association with that activity, so when you stop playing, they see it as fair game for them to stop playing. What a lot of people don't understand is that kids have a good sense of what is fair at a pretty early age, like 4-6, and an adult screaming and shouting at them for what seems like little or no reason does not come across well to them.

Being an overlord is not helpful. Being completely hands off is not helpful. Actually spending quality time with your kid, doing things they want to do in a productive manner, and not what you want them to do, is far healthier.

If you want them to do other activities, get it drilled into them, again, by engaging with them that other things can be fun, and show them that it can be fun rather than pressing ideals onto a kid about what you think they should be doing to have fun and forcing them to do it."
britishproblems,fexj453,t1_fex91r6,1579431825.0,"And yet little green army men are still a popular toy for kids. Lots of other ""age appropriate"" games, like Minecraft, involve the use of weapons, nerf guns are more popular than ever, laser tag is still a thing. We take kids out to medieval castles to learn about, and possibly partake in a bit of sword fighting. Kids at the age of 7 are generally going to WWII and WWI museums and learning about some of the most horrible things humanity has ever done.

Hiding it away from a kid is going to do fuck all. Because you can't control every moment of their lives, as much as wannabe controlling parents like to imagine and their kids aren't under their supervision at all times.

One of the best things to do is to be a big more pragmatic and proactive. If they're going to be playing a game, play with them, teach them why a video game is just that, a game. Why it is fantasy and that it does not extend to real life. Especially in an era of mostly online games, they need additional supervision with regards to communications and knowing to avoid stranger danger on these platforms. You engage with them, so that they have the faculties in the future to deal with things better.

And if anything having some set time to do the same activity as your child, gives them a more tangible boundary. If you're playing a game with them, and having fun. Once you're done, it feels fair that they should stop playing too, which gives them a better grasp of limiting play time rather than an overbearing adult shouting at them for what, to the kid seems unreasonable."
britishproblems,fexi5ra,t1_fewxukj,1579431396.0,"Restrictions mean fuck all. Did you listen to every thing your parents said as a kid or teenager? If you think you did, you're most likely lying to yourself.

Kids are going to do shit that you don't want them to, regardless. It is just the nature of the game. Hiding away, sticking your fingers in your ears, putting your head in the sand, and pretending that a few artificial limits are going to do anything is folly. Teaching them to balance these things, that they are not real life, giving them the tools and pro-actively engaging with them, why they like these things, and why too much is a bad thing not productive in the long run. And kids also have a sense of fairness at that age too, so you have to show them that you're limiting yourself in some way too. Like, too many times I've seen parents scream at their kids to cut down on screen time, but then will crack out phones themselves within a minute of doing so. If you get your kids to give something up, you have to give something up too.

And if they're at an age where they're using social media, they're working around any restrictions you impose within an hour anyway. With social media, pretending it doesn't exist or that it only exists for a set amount of time is unrealistic. Understanding the pitfalls of social media, making sure your kids know that spending too much time on social media is unproductive and that they are often highlight reels that paint unrealistic expectations of ourselves and society as a whole, is probably a lot more productive. Being aware of these things and having your hand in it too, is far better than just being restrictive because of what appears to the kids, as being an arbitrary reason"
britishproblems,fexhsxf,t1_fexfq93,1579431224.0,"No different from laser tag, nerf guns, playing Cowboys & Indians (or whatever it's called these days). Fuck, we glorify medieval era combat to our kids, we teach them how knights of old used weapons and ""age appropriate"" franchises like Minecraft actively sell branded weapons kids can use to hit each other with.

So long as you teach kids it is a fantasy, it is fiction, and not reality, so that they have a firm grasp of what is fun and play, and that it should not be with harmful intent, then it is not an issue. Doubly so when there have literally been lots of studies over the years that prove there is no association between video games and increasing violence. It's shitty attitudes that lead people to being violent.

And it's no worse than how we glorify the army, how the news constantly shows us images of war and struggle."
britishproblems,fexh9kd,t1_fex78hd,1579430985.0,"I mean, it's a potential tracking device that you can monitor your kids with. They don't need a brand new one, but there's no harm in giving them something that is heavily restricted, allows you to dial in their location, and if they're at a friends house or need emergency contact with you at some point, it is on hand."
britishproblems,fexh5dk,t1_fexg2wd,1579430926.0,"> What’s important is to teach them right from wrong, the difference between reality and games and not let them become totally obsessed.

Ding ding. And this is what OP is missing out on. He/she is so obsessed with being protective and what is age appropriate, as many parents do, they don't realise that their kids are going to be exposed to this anyway. The best thing to do, is to be a bit pragmatic and proactive. Engage with the kids, Fortnite is very much a fantasy and far more cartoony than a lot of the edgy games we had in the 90s and 00s. Teach kids that it is fantasy, that it's not real (because if obviously isn't), make sure they know to be safe online and give them the tools to empower them to learn. 

Fuck, it's probably better to engage and play Fortnite with them, it being a multi-platform game and all. The cat is out of the bag and pretending it doesn't exist won't work. Not only does it give OP something to bond with their kids over, when you have a set play time, the kids will not feel aggrieved if they're forced to stop playing. Like, kids develop a good sense of fairness around the ages of 4-6 (from personal experience and having seen a study about it on r/science recently), so an adult that comes crashing in, screaming NO MORE SCREEN TIME, will not feel fair to them. Of course, it's the right thing to do, but people need to understand things from the kids perspective. So if you engage and play with them, if you're stopping play, it feels more fair for them to be told to stop. Who knows, you might also have a little bit of fun at the same time. Doubly so when a parent screams NO MORE SCREEN TIME then proceeds to whack out their phone.

And if you want them to try something else, try with them. Learn, show them that other things can be fun. And if they suck at it and are discouraged, don't be afraid to suck at it too, because I know from personal experience again, that many parents like to give this image to their kids that they are perfect and infallible, when there's a lot to be gained from being human and failing. Fuck, I spent a lot of time with my nephews when they were that age, and doing things like playing games with them , telling them that I'm done and moving on to do something else, encouraged them to do the same. Even if I had to cook for them, I'd get them involved in that rather than leave them to the TV or whatever else so that we were still engaged in an activity that wasn't a video game and something new to them. I was productive and didn't have to worry about feeding them on time, they'd learn a little about cooking every time they were over, it got them away from a screen and never felt like much of a chore. Video games should not be something you need to repress and restrict if you genuinely have a hold of things and have plenty of other fun activities to replace it with. The fact that these kids are obviously clamouring for Fortnite and probably using the time tested failure of an excuse ""but so and so's parents let them play"", to which every parent responds ""I don't care what so and so's parents do, this is my house and my rules"", suggests that despite OP's claims, there's a big Fortnite shaped void to be filled and they haven't found a way to manage or fill it besides restriction and trying to stop them from playing it at home when they're going to play it elsewhere anyway."
britishproblems,fexgtwv,t3_eqtj5z,1579430767.0,"Fortnite is fine, video games are fine. Reinforcing positive associations with limited screen time and letting them know it is absolute fantasy so that they can differentiate between fantasy and reality, is a good thing.

These things aren't going to go away and hiding them from your child will only mean that they will encounter it elsewhere, not under your auspices and supervision, so they will have to learn themselves. 

If you are not proactive and pragmatic, they will not learn from you."
