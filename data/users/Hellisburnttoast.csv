bridezillas,ffcnus7,t1_ffccmuc,1579803434.0,"Your wedding sounds like it was fun because it was about you and your husband both bringing something you liked into your special day.  I may be being a hypocrite here though,  I did insist my bridesmaids wore the same style ballet flats on the day, only allowing my one bridesmaid to change into her Dr Martens for the reception.  She did change the laces to ribbons to match the colour of her dress and cut a fine figure on the dance floor in her custom docs and puffy sleeved dress,  with huge bow (it was the nineties).  She could also belch and say ""bollocks"" at the same time.  She's still my best friend today."
bridezillas,ffc5zje,t1_ffc5pmw,1579792327.0,Hope you have a wonderful day and wish you many years of happiness xx
bridezillas,ffc25yf,t1_ffc05s0,1579789655.0,"Weddings sound completely bonkers to me,  these days.  Colour scheme???  Aesthetics??  Glad I married years ago,  in simpler times.  When everyone wore their hair however they damn well wanted because it was their hair and no one should dictate how it should look for ONE day."
mildlyinfuriating,ffbkcse,t1_ffbjuz3,1579769442.0,I have heard the legends of tidy Primarks.  I think we have over eager shoppers where I live
mildlyinfuriating,ffbivdi,t1_ffbakul,1579767363.0,"I have Primark near me.  If I go there,  it has to be immediately after opening,  because that's the only time the aisles are clear enough to walk through.  It's not long before the clothes are pulled from the racks and dumped. I see the assistants frantically refolding sometimes and they do it without complaining. Only for their hard work to be undone minutes later.  I hope Primark pays their employees well."

TalesFromTheCustomer,ff2ixvt,t1_ff2hcut,1579508196.0,"I was wondering if there was some legal action to this. It is a very serious lie to make out of pure pettiness.  Who knows what the next accusation will be,  if that's the starting point."
TrueOffMyChest,ff2iax1,t1_ff2h36z,1579507364.0,"So sorry that happened to you.  Felt angry just reading it,  experiencing that level of pig-ignorance must have been so soul destroying. Hope you threw that tea in her face"

TalesFromYourServer,ff2hdc1,t3_er53go,1579506193.0,"I often wonder if servers have a fantasy of shoving food right into the customers faces. Really grinding it in,  so some goes up their nostrils. Then making a witty remark and flouncing off."
IDontWorkHereLady,ff2h2qx,t3_er6vg2,1579505833.0,"My husband repairs domestic appliances.  His well meaning parents used to give out our home number to their friends offering them cheaper repairs on their washing machine even though he works for a company, not himself and I would often end up taking people's details then phoning them through to him. One evening,  when my children were little,  an old lady kept ringing every few minutes and asking for my husband and I kept telling her he was still at work.  She said no every time I asked if I could take her details,  she wanted to talk to him.  After about the fifth time in half an hour she rang again,  to find he was still not home and grumpily said ""this is no way to run a business!! "" I politely informed her we were not a business,  she was ringing a private,  ex-directory home number and I was his wife, trying to cook a meal for my young children."

AmItheAsshole,fex7rrs,t3_eqqgby,1579426372.0,"No one seems to be able to behave in a cinema these days.  If I have paid stupid money to see a film,  it's because I want to see and hear it.  I did not pay to listen to a crying child,  a telephone conversation,  or the incessant rustling and crunching of someone eating an endless bag of noisy crisps."
AmItheAsshole,fem9iff,t1_feltfjj,1579244778.0,"Definitely follow this advice.  This manipulative behaviour needs to be stopped.  SIL should be apologizing,  not you.  If you reach out to her,  she's got the upper hand.  Make sure your husband knows if anything happens to that desk,  there will be blood spilled.  And it won't be yours."
AmItheAsshole,fejut59,t3_epirbk,1579186348.0,Jeez.  That poor girl probably has PTSD.  not one person close to her supported her in one of the most frightening times of her life.  Then she basically gets told it's all her own fault. Hope karma slaps the op good and hard in the face.

I couldn't imagine being as cruel and controlling  as some of the JustNoM and JustNoMILs are.  Don't parents want their children to go out into the world as free spirits and live their best lives??? Thank goodness for the ones who show their shiny spine and put these JustNos in their place"
britishproblems,fe6tekn,t1_fe6rhxu,1578904591.0,Not just the front pages either.  Carried on for at least five or six in the paper I looked through in the Chinese takeaway. Five or six pages on a couple making a decision to move away.  No wonder I turn to Twitter for the things that really matter

mildlyinfuriating,fe24cro,t3_eneebc,1578834365.0,"I went to a daytime showing of Doctor Sleep (don't judge me).  I never take more than a sneaky bag of sweets in with me.  The  mess and debris left by three teenage lads who sat several rows in front of us was disgusting.  It looked like they had only eaten half of the piles of stuff they had brought in and tipped the rest on the floor.  I gave my commiserations to the poor young girl who had come in to clean up.  She had the resigned look of someone who had seen it all before. In my opinion,  cinema staff do not get paid enough for what they have to put up with now. I get laid more and I don't have to tidy up someone's filth."

AmItheAsshole,fdud73g,t3_emw6xl,1578731335.0,I worked in unemployment benefits many years ago.  I remember several times sorting benefits out for men who had lost their jobs/business and their wives had immediately walked out.
insaneparents,fdu9jgv,t3_emxkgb,1578729922.0,"She could always choose not to look at the woman who is breastfeeding.  There are lots of different directions to look in.  This was proven by the time I was in the park and had to find a quiet place to breastfeed my daughter.  A group of teenage lads came walking past,  so not such a quiet place.  They managed to look in every direction but at me.  So,  it can be done."
JUSTNOMIL,fdd8863,t3_eknozz,1578299260.0,"Oh the memories.  My firstborn screamed all the time for the first three months.  Could never find the reason.  Went to see doctor,  the little did smiled and giggled the whole time we were there.  Came to the conclusion that she cried to make sure she was cuddled.  The hell eventually stopped and I could go out in public without being stared at."
AmItheAsshole,fdd7v72,t3_ekkjwl,1578298757.0,"NTA.  In fact,  although I am the mother,  I feel like I should set these boundaries for me.  I have been trying to practice yoga for some time but get interrupted frequently.  My family is lovely but thinks nothing of yelling for me to ask all sorts of things or charge into the room.  If the phone rings,  they will still bring it in to me.  Sounds like you have the best arrangements with your family and they are worth trying in my house"

insaneparents,fcxhn5c,t3_ej79he,1578063156.0,"Two of the students I work with are pretty much taking care of their younger siblings.  As a result,  they are both very behind where they could be with their studies and have bad anxiety.  One misses a lot of his lessons because he is always babysitting,  the other is very anxious and easily upset.  The first is always hungry because he never eats properly.  No one is looking after his needs.  The other spends her weekends taking her younger siblings to swimming lessons and any parties they have been invited to,  making it impossible for her to socialise herself.  I get so mad for them,  the poor kids have no childhood."
happy,fcxfpg0,t3_ejdo1q,1578061734.0,I kind of get what you are saying.  My daughter was premature and spent two weeks in Special Care.  She seemed so fragile and tiny to be left.  She's a beautiful twenty three year old woman now and I have been truly blessed with the best of memories.  I wish this for you too.  The future is full of joy
toastme,fcrsopi,t3_eigh2g,1577906099.0,You must be here for a reason because it's obvious you are truly loved.  Cats don't just love anyone and your cat clearly loves deeply.
AmItheAsshole,fcnr243,t3_ei3eco,1577816825.0,"Had  a similar thing one NYE,  many years ago.  It was the tipping point that made me start to distance myself.

AmItheAsshole,fbvqjfi,t3_eejyso,1577134620.0,I had a miscarriage before going on to have two beautiful daughters.  No one where I work knows because I have never mentioned it.  I think about it occasionally but don't feel the need to bring it up all the time.  You are NTA.
