teaching,fesc5gc,t3_eqg72a,1579363750.0,"I’ve found this with a BME child in the class I work with, and I’m wondering if Christmas/ other religious/cultural events triggers something. This child has participated in all the activities and festivities towards the end of last term- despite not actually celebrating the season or being religiously associated with it (they are Hindu). One thing I’ve tried to do is just be more aware, I love religious education and teach it when I cover, so whatever I’m teaching to do with this, I always make a point of asking their opinion from their own perspective. Eg. We were discussing creation from a Christian standpoint, obvs lots of opinions (8/9yos) so I asked him what Hindus believe. I actually asked him one on one, not spotlight for the class to hear- and a couple of pupils around started asking questions. I asked him if he was happy to share and he was, and the class sat and listened to his views. He seemed happy to be the one sharing the knowledge, and more bright and animated than I’d seen him in a while. Sorry for the long story, I think what I’m trying to say is by turning perceived difference into a point of learning where the student gets to tell his/her own story and own it can go a long way to making them feel included when they are the minority, especially if they have autonomy and are respectfully heard.

Edit: forgot to add, we only have about 4-5 BME students in our school and from experience my perspective is the focus on culture and religion that they don’t belong to, especially things like Christmas that tend to take over for a while dulls their sense of individuality, they get swept along with all the associated activities and become a part of something that isn’t theirs, and they know they don’t “belong”. I wonder also if for younger children especially this evokes an unintended sense of (and forgive me if I’m not wording this right) almost disregard for their own culture and religion from the perspective of their white teachers and fellow pupils? 
Really interested in hearing people’s views on this comment thread. I’m doing a PhD in Education and Social Justice with a huge focus on inclusion as a whole."

ChoosingBeggars,fdwpy3z,t3_en6it8,1578761256.0,"Oh my gosh- wedddings bring out the ugly don’t they! Sort of similar experience happened to me but it was one of the bridesmaids. I’m also not qualified, do it as a hobby, apparently am pretty reasonable at the skill and do friends/my gf. Anyway, gfs friend who I am also sorta friendly with wanted me to do her wedding make up and 3 bridesmaids. Ok no problem. She asked me about what I would charge and was willing to pay me the going rate in my area as she’s seen many of my looks before on nights out and had confidence I’d do her a good job- I said consider it a wedding gift (bride wasn’t exactly flush with money and was trying to keep costs down which I knew). Bride was thrilled- we were also invited to the wedding before this- until we bumped into her and one of her bridesmaids on a night out. Myself and my gf had full on glam looks going on, bride was showing bridesmaids who I was. Bridesmaid immediately said she’s not coming near my face if she isn’t qualified, I can find someone to do better  how do you know she’s any good etc etc. Bride was horrified, and immediately called her out, pointing out my face and my gfs, bridesmaid still stood her ground. I said fine, your face your choice but you’ll have to pay someone else to do it and she was mortified when she found out it would have been free. Long story short, bridesmaid ended up not in the wedding party. Not just for this but other related reasons, I.e she was a massive bitch."

makeupflatlays,fcu9ht3,t3_eiywf1,1577975720.0,"Left to right- 
Asteroid, Star Dust, Luna and Supernova.

I love these eyeshadow toppers and have repurchased. Available in Superdrug and Tesco (uk) they are very affordable (£4.99).

They work great over eyeshadow (duh) and don’t disturb or remove colour. I also use them for adhering pressed glitter or pigments, they work really well for this.

My only moan with these is that they appear to have reformulated Supernova- my favourite shade. It’s a bit thinner than previously, still works but just different to what it used to be. I can’t tell if I’ve purchased a dud one as they had no testers available but when I run out I’ll repurchase again anyhow. 
Well worth the money and don’t dry out!"
makeupflatlays,fcu7o7s,t1_fctimbq,1577974502.0,Lick and lash are a fairly newish indie brand from the UK- can’t say I’ve tried anything else from them but I definitely will in the future!

PanPorn,fct8xf3,t1_fct6lba,1577936034.0,"Honestly you’re friend is very lucky haha, it’s a great addition for someone who loves black eyeshadow. I was gifted this too by my gf, and tbh even though I love UD and premium beauty, I probably wouldn’t have purchased this myself because, well, it’s just a black eyeshadow and basic colours like that just don’t catch my eye- at premium prices I’m looking for the wow factor. It’s quality really does speak for itself though,  I’ve really managed to upgrade my smokey eye looks and will definitely repurchase again it’s totally worth the price tag!"

PanPorn,fcsa6x1,t1_fcs9jug,1577913666.0,"It’s the blackest black I’ve ever tried, imho nothing else compares in terms of colour density. If I’m going for a dramatic smokey look I won’t even bother with any other blacks but this one- unless I’m using them as transition shades as compared to blackout all the others I own just don’t reach that depth of colour."
makeupflatlays,fcrv62n,t3_eimebw,1577907047.0,"Top left- Sample Beauty the Hydrographic Palette. Love love love this palette! So easy to blend, highly pigmented and stunning colours 

Top right- BH Cosmetics Take me Back to Brazil eyeshadow palette. Think this was one of my first “proper” colour palettes and now it’s a bit of a veteran in my collection but I love it nevertheless. I mainly use the greens and blues, and of course the yellow with the pan but it’s very pigmented and easy to blend. Can’t say I really use the highlighters but i quite like the black shade!

Bottom left- Lick and Lash Beauty Playful Palette. Wow this palette. Pan sizes are huge, colours very blendable. I also like that it has a pressed pigment/glitter type shade (Athena, middle bottom row) as if I’m travelling I don’t need to pack an additional pot of pigment

Bottom right- Jolie Beauty Proud Palette. Love the concept and this palette as a whole. Received this as a gift and had never tried anything from this brand before. Also as I’d seen it advertised on Instagram I would not have purchased this myself as I was sceptical it would be one of the cheap low quality ones constantly peddled in the advertisements. Large pans, 3 rows of very pigmented shadows with complementing glitters. The green glitter layered over black is my all time favourite addition to a green smokey eye. Great palette with a good cause!"
makeupflatlays,fcrsj5p,t3_eilyo9,1577906042.0,"L’Oréal shake and glow setting spray. honestly don’t love this but don’t hate it either. Prefer MUR setting sprays but would repurchase

Kiko Milano Dark Treasure Diamond Perfecting Fluid- got this on the latest Kiko sale. Gutted it’s limited edition, I really like this as a primer. Contains HA and gives a slightly tacky finish which personally I prefer

Lancôme La Base Pro- HG primer. Used this for years and honestly does the job. Alternate this with Kiko as it has a better longevity but a more siliconey feel

Lancôme Teint Idole ultra wear foundation in shade 008. HG foundation. I only wear this, or doublewear. I mix this with doublewear with a ration of 3:1. Honestly could not be happier with this foundation, gives a lovely luminous finish. I only mix it with DW to appease my difficult and changeable undertones 

Estée Lauder Doublewear foundation in 2N1 Deser Beige. As explained above I mix to adjust to my undertones which are changeable depending on seasons. I also have a slightly darker forehead so this helps even out my face shade

Collection Lasting Perfection 16 hour concealer. Drugstore but I honestly prefer this to all high end concealers I’ve tried as it performs the best on my skin. I apply it with a concealer brush dampened in setting spray and to conceal under my brows.

Urban Decay Primer Potion in Minor Sin. Bought before I knew they had reformulated this, won’t even go there about how different it is to the original formula but I intend to use it up as it’s done for shimmers and neutrals I wear for work. Wouldn’t even touch it for more dramatic eye looks requiring a lot of blending though!

Milani Baked Powder blush in Dolce Pink. Milani is a recently new addition to Boots in the UK previously was hard to get hold as I don’t live near any other stores that stock it, and nothing I’ve seen on the website has wowed me enough to buy blind. I don’t love this as for a baked blush I have to work very hard to get the pigment I’m wanting, but the colour is perfect for my skintone (pretty pale)

Kiko Milano shade Fusion Trio Blush in 04. Now this surprised me. When I first opened it, I was. Not. Impressed. The colours looked too pale and it didn’t look at all like it would pack a punch but it actually applies nicely without too much hard work and is very buildable. Gives me a nice natural flush which I often struggle to achieve with my skin tone 

Makeup Revolution Pro Brow Pomade in Blonde. Works great, used it for years. Can’t really compare to high end brow pomades such as ABH because honestly it’s so hit and miss for me with brow products as a lot pull very orange/red on me. This does the job and is affordable, and I was able to swatch first as I can get it from many stores around me

Bourjois Volume Clubbing Ultra Black mascara. Used to wear this years ago then moved to high end, UD Perversion and Lancôme mascaras were usually my go to as I had forgotten how well this performs. Honestly more impressed with this than UD troublemaker as it has a more wet feel, imho very comparable to a mini Perversion with the brush 

Kiko Milano Falae Lashes Concentrate building base mascara. Works well, pretty happy with this as I use it with a heated eyelash curler before mascara and it doesn’t all melt away with the heat 

Catrice Better than Gold Baked Highlighter palette. Oh my. I love this! I also have the Better than Platinum version. I picked these up in Malta as to my knowledge Catrice isn’t sold in stores in the UK. Buildable, lovely shades and can also give that blinding highlight when layered. I paid about £10 I think for each, would totally recommend

Essence Be Royal Not Cute eyeshadow palette. Again another buy from Malta as the selection of Essence products in the UK is very limited. Can only buy from one store (Wilkos) and the products are not up to date with the latest releases. This palette is lovely, 12 shimmers and 5 mattes all in nude berry shades. I tend to lean towards the more nude/champagne shades for work but I’m not going to lie I do pull this out for more special occasion make up when I’m going for a cranberry eye look more so than some high end palettes I own. Think I paid roughly £14 for this but would definitely repurchase if I planned it, would probably even go so far to have it shipped to the UK and pay the extortionate taxes."

MakeupEducation,fcrkryj,t3_eih1uh,1577903108.0,"Same kind of eyeshape as you described, personally I always use primer as I find the application of eyeshadows much smoother and nicer to blend. Day to day I use UD primer potion (I’m not the biggest fan of the reformulation) as I tend to wear only neutral shimmers for work. For more dramatic looks I use eyeliner as a primer and base. For example for a smokey/dramatic look where I’m blending a lot of black I will use Estee Lauder doublewear eyeliner pencil. Apply where I want the black shadow to go, and smudge/blend before eyeshadow. Gives a greater depth to the black and prevents patchiness especially around the outer area of my eye. Also works for other colours too, I have a lot of the UD 24/7 liners in different colours so I use those as a base."

They also work as adhesive for pressed glitter- it just melts into the shadow topper without the gritty appearance that can happen with some glitter adhesives.

Also Collection concealers, last ages and better than some high end imho."
