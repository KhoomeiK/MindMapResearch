thelastofusfactions,ff8mmjn,t1_ff7urlb,1579686089.0,That’s why this game is so great. It’s impossible to master and every game is so different
thelastofusfactions,ff8maav,t1_ff7r3ke,1579685554.0,I’ve been playing this game solidly for five years. What the hell is aim assist?!
thelastofusfactions,ff8m9b1,t3_es1mah,1579685512.0,skill!
thelastofusfactions,ff76at9,t3_es08ia,1579641969.0,Support. I still think it’s the best
thelastofusfactions,ff769ja,t1_ff75yvu,1579641949.0,because I don’t understand how it takes skill? You don’t have to aim with much accuracy and you can down someone with one shot before they have a chance of retaliating.

nathanforyou,ff4khil,t3_erezpj,1579565802.0,I hope this is true! She’s very lovely looking. I hope they’re happy!
thelastofusfactions,ff4kax9,t1_ff4k7vi,1579565674.0,I was just unsure as you veered from seeming proud to backtracking and saying the other players mistakes were the madness. I’ve just got a personal hatred for the shotgun.
thelastofusfactions,ff4k08a,t1_ff3zpmb,1579565465.0,No idea why this is so downvoted. No skill on display here.  I’m sure OP is good but this clip ain’t upload worthy. Shotgun is dreadful.
thelastofusfactions,ff4jwcn,t3_ergx2p,1579565390.0,How can you be proud of using a shotgun?
aww,ff3lagw,t1_ff3grn0,1579543464.0,That must feel so weird! I wonder what those people get out of it :/
thelastofusfactions,ff3l8tx,t1_ff3gv3j,1579543435.0,It’s quite funny in a way
thelastofusfactions,ff2vzv5,t1_ff2jpkc,1579526271.0,I’ve never understood why people bother about the whole camp thing after a while. I just play to win a game.

ExNoContact,ff2vwy2,t3_er6bwc,1579526185.0,"I kinda feel that however good your friendships may be, everyone is busy and wrapped up in their own shit. If you’ve been in a relationship with someone you love and who loves you it’s amazing, you never feel alone. Having that taken away is really rough. Some of us can only fully relax around that special someone so it’s like a part of our personality dies when they go"

nathanforyou,fey2nx2,t3_eqlj8l,1579439945.0,Why would you make stuff up? It was a decent enough story without that
aww,fev61tq,t1_feu7x95,1579393471.0,Actually surprised and relieved to see it IS your cat. Was ready to get snarky
nathanforyou,fev5ojf,t1_fev5kg4,1579393424.0,"I actually was just too stoned to be honest. You could totally mock someone for this in a very nice, non douchy way."
nathanforyou,feuyfya,t1_feu340j,1579391172.0,It seems so out of character for him to mock someone. Unless he did a very good act

socialanxiety,fensq3c,t1_fenqetb,1579290153.0,By doing it again and again and getting better at it. I think it is that simple. And by being confident that you have a lot of stuff to say and I think that comes from being really interested in a lot of stuff and being interested in people.
socialanxiety,fenjgnq,t1_fenixr2,1579286004.0,Equally by getting used to it you can grow stronger and give less fucks. And people will probably respond positively to you being looser
beginnerfitness,femzzr9,t1_femp4wq,1579273883.0,This! I realised recently that I’m greedy as fuck. I’ll see other people eat far smaller portions than I. You can recondition your cravings and your portion size. When I quit sugar for a week the urge to eat it disappeared. When you eat less the urge to eat a lot disappears. It’s just consistency
HighStrangeness,femzrmc,t1_femzokc,1579273733.0,I understand that expecting answers from “official sources” is naive but at the same time expecting it to be some sort of conspiracy could be equally naive.
HighStrangeness,femz0kn,t1_femyp7d,1579273215.0,Wiki page is very dismissive of it
beginnerfitness,femc0t5,t1_fembw2d,1579247933.0,"Yes. The liver eventually burns fat as a fuel source rather than sugar. But don’t take my word for it, look it up and people will explain it far better. It worked wonders for me when I did it for just two months.  Cut out soda. Try and find a way of living that’s sustainable, rather than diving into something you’ll give up after a few weeks. 

And walking is fine,jogging is cool. Whatever you can do! It doesn’t have to be horrible too. And weight training you can do without any equipment if you find a good guide. 

Please keep us updated!"
beginnerfitness,fembhae,t3_epvywu,1579247240.0,"I’d say taking on a low carb, high protein, high fat diet (aka keto). It’s surprisingly easy and the only diet I’d ever want to stick to. It makes your body shed fat. 

That combined with 30 mins of incline walking on a treadmill (you can watch Netflix and it’s not too exhausting, win win) and weight training would make a massive difference. You can do it man!"
ExNoContact,femb8kc,t1_fem5juu,1579246928.0,I’m really sorry! It’s really awful. The only conclusion I can come to is a cliche one - we deserve better!
nosurf,feklo61,t3_epigdp,1579202634.0,I like to post things for my own personal memory but fuck seeing other people’s shit. Selfish maybe but I genuinely don’t need that in my life for obvious reasons
JoeRogan,fek7skl,t1_fdhczdo,1579194395.0,I’m amazed that people think they’re funny just repeating the same dead shit over and over
JoeRogan,fek6n74,t1_fdgoswv,1579193710.0,How come? It’s my first episode with him on and he barely talks? It’s a Joe monologue. Enjoyed it but he may as well not be there
JoeRogan,fek4ltx,t1_fdg0bn6,1579192494.0,By not talking? He barely said anything
RelationshipAdviceNow,fejnuxy,t3_ephi6k,1579181109.0,"Talk to her, ask her what she needs. Do what she needs."
ExNoContact,fejmer0,t3_epiu66,1579179797.0,"I would also add that I’m doing all of this for me. Not to try and get her back. There’s zero hoping that she’s going to see sense and come around (though part of me thinks she’s made a massive mistake and I do want her to realise, though that’s probably the worse sides of my ego talking there). You do all this for you, to become a better, stronger, more emotionally in-tune, wiser person. Don’t try and get your ex back unless YOU really fucked it up. If they hurt you then move the fuck on."

ExNoContact,feho4vf,t3_ep6aq5,1579120491.0,"Damn. Here’s hoping we all get there. It IS the best, no matter what some people may try and tell you about being happy alone or how love always fails or some bullshit. There’s a reason why people say love makes the world go round"
ExNoContact,fehc7y3,t1_fegyygx,1579113569.0,I hope his mum schools him
ExNoContact,fegv4kk,t1_feguy7k,1579103222.0,They may have done but he effectively cheated on you and left you. You could have been there for him when stuff went bad so he doesn’t really deserve sympathy. Good on you.

Also - I feel his story about being miserable and wanting you back was probably a bit bullshit. Please don’t take that the wrong way but people are capable of such deception and if he was a genuine guy he would never have done what he did."

classicalpiano,fef619n,t3_eos6od,1579049019.0,Hi! The Brahms exercises are fantastic. As are the first few Dochyani. Also don’t underestimate the power of making your own up based on what you want to improve. Or taking sections of pieces and working through the challenges they represent.
ExNoContact,feea98z,t1_fee9jsz,1579029614.0,"Yeah, you’re worth more. My ex did loads of damage to me, but it’s ok because I acted honourably the whole way through and gave my all, so no regrets and it’s truly her loss"
ExNoContact,fee7vvo,t1_fee6mn7,1579028219.0,I think you can do a lot better and I hope you know that

Edit - I didn’t get to the last two - I don’t think they’re helpful sorry. Hoping they start to care is counterproductive. I’m convinced my ex made a dreadful mistake but ruminating on that is a total waste of time. The best way to do this is to shut of all hope and attachment. If they get in contact you don’t lose out - you either get back together forever or you don’t care about them anymore."

Sometimes people want to know their problem isn’t super unique to them, it’s nice knowing other people have experienced what you have and are doing ok but bloody hell. So many people just talk about their experience and don’t just let you talk. It’s really frustrating to be on the receiving end of this"

thelastofusfactions,fe5yrnc,t1_fe5tob5,1578877942.0,"I played only as support for about 5 years until about 6 months ago when I wanted to try the Bow. I sucked at it so I tried covert too to see what it’s like. I get about the same success rate as I did before BUT the idea of going back to Supply is a bit intimidating. Covert IS a crutch. I never camp and I’m always moving and trying to find an angle and I have plenty of face to face encounters but still. Being able to slip into covert is so damn easy at times. There’s always going to be something that gives people an advantage - I hate any type of shotgun and I despise the crossbow with all my soul but yeah, going back to supply is gonna test me"
