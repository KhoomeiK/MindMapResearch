depression,ff6rb2h,t3_ersyw1,1579633243.0,"Yup.  And more so because, these are people who think they “know us” when it couldn’t be farther from the truth.  Makes me lonelier and would rather just be alone, or with a professional with an objective perspective of my situation."
MandelaEffect,feonyy4,t1_fegivo3,1579302769.0,"This!   I’ve even stumbled upon YouTube video titles with peoples names who I am thinking about in the recommended section.  Even someone I was flat out insecure about at the time (Yeah I know lol).  But I’ve given up on trying to keep any “thought privacy” in my head, and basically narrate my life.  And act if I was Jim in The Office and look in “the camera” sometimes when things around me are dumb.  If ANYTHING is watching/listening to me, might as well give them a good show.  So don’t let it get to you.  Instead, give them a nice big show.  

My biggest thing about phones trying to control us/read our minds is the fact that, once, I was whispering to myself about something.  I was alone and my house was quiet like I like it.   But I started to whisper to myself about a few things going on, and my phone that was inches away at the table, suddenly lit up.  (I have the iPhone XR).  It was the craziest thing since I was a good deal away and the house was otherwise quiet.  Why was my Siri trying to pick up on this?   Almost as if it wanted to listen to whatever I was being quiet about.  I don’t know.  Some freaky shit is going down for sure."
collapse,fedbfpu,t3_eo9gsd,1579006597.0,"East coast here.  Yeah, I told the person I was with, “Enjoy this right now, cause this is just a short term pleasure to something that’s going to SUCK in the long term.”"
twinflames,feclvjo,t3_eobebi,1578977132.0,I really like the second to last line.  Relatable.
childfree,fdrept5,t3_emnsg0,1578683523.0,"Wait till you meet the satanist guys, lol.  There’s a BUNCH of weird ass dudes out there..."
MandelaEffect,fdrbci6,t3_emlbrw,1578682046.0,"Reality is trippy, I’ve had SO many experiences that would classify me as a nutter if I spoke out about them.  But I agree, it’s like things since that year are kind of being “forced” I mean if you look at the amount of memes/posts about suicide, anxiety and depression these days, a lot of people are silent sufferers and still pushing themselves to go to work/school and be a part of this sick society.  Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/qkAFY6y9SFo) on a school where 6 students committed suicide last year.   I remember it used to be that it was one kid per school, if any.  Anyway, it’s like we can all collectively agree shit sucks but *at least it’s not dying of small pox* right?  But mental illness is more rampant than it was 100 years ago.  So while we have advanced technologically... people are still suffering.  Just in a different way, there’s not vaccines against mental illnesses."
YouOnLifetime,fdpoq1p,t3_emhzli,1578634886.0,"I mean, we wanted him to stop killing, right?"
YouOnLifetime,fdop6mo,t3_emat8n,1578609776.0,"Penn is trying his best, but fangirls (especially any girls who have issues at home or whatever) will find a way to romanticize him.  I look at them as the same kind of girls that could land in these situations, since they’re so sympathizing.  Abusive relationships are not all that uncommon for a reason."
Adulting,fdonnw6,t3_emep5h,1578608857.0,Amazing!
Paranormal,fdon6mu,t3_em0mt3,1578608568.0,"Thank you for this story.  Often times when the paranormal is discussed, it’s usually dark stuff and you forget that there’s a whole other side of things."

socialanxiety,fdm5hjw,t1_fdls79b,1578540275.0,"Oh my god, so much this."
MandelaEffect,fdfpajp,t1_fdd7xk9,1578366963.0,"Yeah.  I think at the very least, it marked the end of an epoch.  Still very eerie, and maybe the God particle being discovered is a part of it.  My feelings are much about feeling like the world is hanging by a thread.  Like, we’re here but we’re not *supposed* to be here anymore."
MandelaEffect,fdd0rlq,t3_ekpcwn,1578290280.0,"Oh, you guys are  *definitely* not the only ones.  I basically measure my whole life as being “pre-2012” and “post-2012” because that year.... that year did something alright.  I have not stopped having that feeling too of something have shifted for the worst."
collapse,fdcxblt,t3_eklalz,1578287060.0,"No more humans, the environment will regenerate, allowing for a new, more superior species to flourish.   Humanity will be the new Dinosaurs, our bones and technology will be discovered and studied by the aliens that come by our planet a few years after the mass extinction event. 

So, I’m leaving behind a bunch of cool memes and things for them to study."
WikiLeaks,fd4tzp4,t3_ejwzt2,1578171094.0,I had my doubts about this guy but whoa.
depression,fd2x9sf,t3_ejvcf6,1578152575.0,24 and my teen years were traumatic as hell.  I actually had a dream I was back in HS last night and woke up relieved as hell to be back in the real world.
socialanxiety,fcwglf1,t1_fcwc01l,1578025091.0,"I’m sorry to hear that.  Well, if you want therapy then you have to tell your parents.  But if they’re the type that would get offended, it’ll only exasperate the problem for you.  It’s up to you to gauge.  I think community centers sometimes have low cost therapists, try to see if yours does. 

This isn’t a substitute for therapy, but there are some apps that are about mindfulness and mental health...  apps like Shine, Sanity & Self, or Betterhelp might help.  Some of them have free features, but the actual counselors and people you can talk to on there cost money.  The premium memberships are pricey, but if it’s out of your budget, take advantage of the free trial period even if it’s only for like a week.  Listen to some of the podcasts on there, they have all kinds of stuff for different issues you may be facing!  (As well as the actual people you can message about things). 

I think your feelings are valid, and if it’s starting to get in the way of your day to day life, seek that professional help.  I wish I had better advice but I also struggle with anxiety and these are some of the things that help me."
socialanxiety,fcwbcro,t3_ej8ox1,1578021472.0,"It sounds like the beginning of a bigger issue.  Definitely seek that help out if you feel you need it.  Especially if you’re young, don’t waste any more time!  It’s hard to ask for help, but maybe dropping by your school counselor may be able to find you the local resources you need."
childfree,fcvb5ez,t1_fcu7rvo,1577998419.0,"This!!  Poor things don’t even know they have other options than behaving the ways they do, but their brain dead parents don’t know how to even begin parenting them.  Most frustrating because you’re just expected to be okay with them being shitty parents."
twinflames,fcv0gi2,t1_fctna1d,1577992133.0,"The invisible string is the perfect analogy.  That’s how it feels.  For me it was very overwhelming having all these feelings and things for them, and even this closeness for their family I’ve never met, making me feel crazy.  Getting in the way of my own life, almost.  All in all it’s been for the best to have that space."
antiMLM,fcuunbd,t1_fckwiar,1577988865.0,"I remember getting caught up by one and ended up buying this nail cleaning kit that was like $70.  The girl went on and on about how amazing it was, etc. 

Years later, I found one of the products at the drugstore for like $3 (nail buffer/polisher).  At least I can say I was a kid when this happened but sheesh.  The scams are real."
Pessimism,fctmu5v,t3_eitms9,1577949374.0,Yes.
twinflames,fctlqct,t3_eitmpo,1577948008.0,"Right?  It takes a while, but eventually you realize it’s okay to be apart too.  I mean, is love all about possession these days?  No.  They are their own person as well, despite the *intense* connection they may have with us."
DepressionRecovery,fctfc3m,t3_eisudh,1577941455.0,The planner community is pretty nice.
