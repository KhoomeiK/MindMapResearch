The use of the word ""female"" alone isn't what makes some people creepy - it's a number of factors, one of which being their adamant refusal to call someone a ""woman"".

I only get gross vibes from it when someone says ""Men and females/Guys and females."" or ""You females are confusing. Us men can't keep up"" etc etc. Other than that it's somewhat irritating to be called female outside of military/scientific/medical environments because it's a clinical and YES dehumanizing word. 

Female can be used to describe so many other things. Animals, insects, fish, plants, door latches, the end of an HDMI cable. Those last two are simply describing the HOLE THE MALE END CONNECTS TO FFS. Female can be almost anything but woman is reserved for mature female human. Insisting on the clinical term because science and the military says you're right is what can often come across as creepy to the women who want to be seen as human.

The whole thing is only mildly irritating however because the only people insisting on it in my own life are my doctor and people I'm trying to avoid conversation with anyway so whatev's."
