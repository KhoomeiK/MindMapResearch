vegetarian,fcqhzn6,t3_eicxgy,1577886334.0,"I think if you just go right into it, don’t hesitate or slow down on meats. Just buy some vegetarian food, try and see what you like (and trust me when I first started I hated a lot of it because it just wasn’t what I wanted but now I’m in love with it) it takes time to find exactly what you like. So just experiment, try new things you never would have before!"

Wiccan,fcn3c3w,t1_fcjf2gt,1577802110.0,"Sure thing! For the good luck spell you’ll need a green candle and that’s it, so first light the green candle, then clear your mind and think/ imagine yourself with the good luck that you want. After you feel you’ve done that enough, Chant the following 3 or more times:
“From this very moment, on this very day, I need good luck to come this way”
(Side note if you’re doing this spell for someone else just do these steps but think of them with the good luck and finish the Chant in “I need good luck to go his/her way”)

For the good luck charm, make a circle around the object you wish to enchant (I personally used rocks for the circle, but you could use the elements, good luck crystals or anything like that). Next focus your energy, into light (good) or dark (bad). As you’re thinking Of that, also think of what you want this good luck charm to help you with. While thinking of all of these things stare into the candle for a while until you feel you should stop. Lastly snuff the candle out and I think it’s better if you let the object sit over night and then wear it or carry it around the next day!"
