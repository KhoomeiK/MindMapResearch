Him and his wife loved their children and were usually far more worried about them than anything else, which is made clear by how they allowed rasputin to scandalize and sexually assult their family all because he was able to save their hemophiliac son. It is belived the reason nicholas did not put up much of a fight because they belived they could go into exile with their family England after the war. 

Sadly they were all executed by firing squad by order of the Bolsheviks, they were all brought into a small room and the squad began firing, they killed the parents first, and the children survived the first round of bullets due to their Jewelry and had to be shot again.

In my opinion though, the best game ever made is Wii sports. Everyone has played wii sports, its fun even if you dont like video games, anyone can pick it up and play it, there aren't any major bugs and its a work out.

 Wii sports is a pure, simple basic video game. It does everything it will and does it perfectly. It took a gimmicky console and turned it into a must have device for almost everyone in America.
