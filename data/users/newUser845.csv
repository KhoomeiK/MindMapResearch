dubai,fesxqo1,t3_eqfwkd,1579370007.0,"I've had a few near misses, majority by others, but haven't had a crash yet. I'd like to give you a few tips.

First of all, you need to keep a safe distance at all times and be prepared to stop every single moment you aren't pressing the brake. If there's less stopping distance (like when traffic is crawling, or in a fast lane where too much space will aggravate those behind - you should avoid fast lane as a beginner though) then you need to be concentrating even more as there's a much higher risk. You also need to be very mentally aware and awake to be able to start stopping almost instantly, if that's not the case then leave even more stopping distance or move to a slower lane.

For your case, paying attention to every car (even if parked) and pedestrian that is within a few metres of your lane would have allowed you to start stopping quicker and avoid needing to slam the brakes. 

Lastly, also be prepared to beep if someone looks like they're going to cross into your lane from the side. Happens often especially with intense sunlight and/or dark tints"
