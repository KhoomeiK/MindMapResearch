Biochemistry,ffd3weo,t3_esxfzq,1579812923.0,"I would say PCR and cell culturing are extremely universal in the biochemistry/bio/neuro worlds. Kept seeing these two techniques pop up over and over and over again when I was applying to research jobs.

Also, knowing how to make buffers/ solutions will be clutch knowledge as well."

neuroscience,fecsc8k,t3_eocvga,1578982751.0,"Not sure if it interest you, but if you get a neuroscience PhD you’ll get a stipend of like $30,000 per year at a lot of places on top of paid tuition.

Edit: lots of people seem to think $30,000 is over shooting the amount you’d actually get but I’m getting my neuro PhD at OHSU right now and my stipend is almost exactly $30,000"

research,fdngcc1,t1_fdmfvr7,1578585214.0,"I really like what this comment said, but I want to add that just because this research experience didn’t go so well doesn’t mean all of them are like that. Research would be much more interesting and exciting if you had a supervisor who actually helped you get through the project. Maybe give it another try with a professor who’s adamant about helping students succeed."
