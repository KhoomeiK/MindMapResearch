He would come in every night when he had got a few coins together and buy a single can of beer to enjoy and we would chat a little. Sometimes I used to have to lock up the shop at night by myself and it wasn't in the best of neighbourhoods so he would insist on walking me to my car to make sure I got home safely and would never allow me to give him money for doing it. He said it was just the right thing to do as a fellow human being. I managed to pay him back in my small ways by bringing him blankets and warm clothes in the winter and cans of food to eat. He was such a nice guy, just down on his luck."

You didn't ruin the experience, you weren't having any fun so that ruined it for you. She should have stopped as soon  as you told her to. As soon as you said your safe word. That's the whole point of having one.
You may not want to go the whole way and say that she assaulted you but that's what she did. You told her to stop and she didnt. That's rape. Non consensual sexual activity

They told Evans that they had found her and he confessed to killing her. In his mind, he was responsible because he had told Mr Christie to go ahead and ""perform the abortion"".

Tell him how much you love him and how much you love his passions but how much they are taking over your lives. Show him in black and white how much they are costing you both and then tell him what else you could do this year with even half that money.

However, it can also be extremely dangerous when it comes to mental illness. 

A good friend of mine killed himself after becoming a weed user and the doctors said it was because it brought on psychosis. He was hearing voices and was convinced that people were out to kill him.

Serial killers have their own set of psychological traits and behaviours that you don't see in Mass Murderers. They are two distinct types of killer in my view. A serial killer will plan, fantasise and dream about his crimes for years before hand and relive it for weeks afterwards. Mass Murderers don't. They have a specific goal e.g getting the money out of an elderly boarder. Once they have killed and gained that, they just move on. There is no lingering over the kill, no trophies or sexual arousal, just moving on to the next victim with money. To me, that is completely different to a serial killer."

Please never believe that it was your fault. Even if you had gone out in the most revealing clothes, got drunk and gone home with a stranger. It still doesn't give them the right to violate your body against your will. Evil men do these things to vulnerable women and if you keep believing that you are to blame then he wins.

Hopefully she will forgive your lapse in common sense and forgive you.

I wouldn't worry about the blackmailer too much. You have done what you can, you have deactivated your account and you have informed the police. These kinds of schemes rarely go any further because as soon as the blackmailer decides to send the pictures out, the police can catch him.

I have got experience with this type of blackmailer but I did not pay them any money at all and it went no further as soon as he worked out that he wasn't getting any from me."
entitledparents,fdkiihk,t1_fdke66z,1578504509.0,"Im so glad its working for you. I have a similar path to you. Mine started around the same time and I was getting 2 or 3 a week. I also went through every medication on the market but when I tried the Topiramate that worked for me. If it ever stops, I might try the Botox as it sounds great."
relationship_advice,fdki5fz,t3_eltyx1,1578504328.0,"No, you can't help what attracts you. Just tell her, be honest about how you feel"
unpopularopinion,fdk7vor,t1_fdjxc8w,1578498089.0,"This is exactly the reason that I see them as heroes. I could easily see myself as a truck driver but I could never see myself as someone who says people are trying to kill us, let me go forward and try and stop them, even if it means laying down my own life to do that.

I have the same level of respect for policemen, firemen and nurses. They are out there every day doing thankless jobs that need doing for which they get abused and assaulted but they still come back day after day."
TalesFromYourServer,fdk4wy3,t3_ellnvg,1578496131.0,"Your dog is gorgeous!.. Trust me when I say that you asking for assistance is not being a Karen. You are not being entitled or precious about anything. You genuinely need assistance and I am sure that if you were asking someone that is not a member of staff, they would not object to helping you or just pointing you in the direction of a staff member."
entitledparents,fdk4n2p,t1_fdk3vcn,1578495944.0,How odd. Its been a lifesaver for me. Ive never tried Botox but I have heard that they are very effective. Let me know how you get on.
entitledparents,fdjtvz5,t1_fdji7rd,1578487328.0,"I know how you feel with migraines. People don't seem to understand that they are not ""just a headache"" either. I suffered badly with them for many years and no amount of painkillers could help me. A Neurologist prescribed me Topiromate which is an anti seizure medication for Epilepsy and it has been brilliant. I take it every day and my migraines have gone from weekly to three or four a year and I now no longer get the cluster headaches in between either."

relationship_advice,fdgtlcv,t1_fdgaxts,1578407990.0,"This is how my relationship with my SO is. He is a mechanic and I have absolutely no idea how a car functions at all. I can put fuel in it but thats my lot. So when he talks to me about wokr, 99% of it goes right over my head but I like to sit and listen to him talk about it anyway as its his passion and it makes him happy. He is in a similar position to me as I work in Finance and he has no idea really what it is that I do for a living but he lets me talk anyway. I'm picking up some terms about cars and he likes that I am able to give him an outside the box perspective on his problems. 

Just because you are in completely different fields doesn't mean that you can't find common ground. Just listen to each other and you will soon pick up what she is on about and be able to talk to her about her work."
CasualConversation,fdgspfn,t3_el7or2,1578407337.0,"When I moved house, it took me about a month of packing to get all my stuff together, packing in the evenings and weekends and would never expect someone else to help pack up my stuff. One friend did show up one night and volunteered to help me pack in exchange for pizza and he also showed up to help me put up shelves and curtains at the new house but he volunteered, I didn't ask him to help me at all."
rapecounseling,fdgebn4,t3_el7fjx,1578392756.0,"Have you spoken to your dad about the assault? I think your dad would take it better than you think. You describe him as being loving and wonderful in your post so I am sure that he will only react with concern and kindness with you. Talking about it together and helping him to understand how you feel at the moment may mean that he is able to help you get over not only the assault itself but also your feeling around him.

I would also suggest getting yourself some therapy as it will be very useful in helping you deal with the whole situation."
serialkillers,fdes7op,t1_fde0wx5,1578345513.0,"Problem he had was that he was killing and dumping his victims at the same time as 2 other killers on the same stretch of highway. They were all nicknamed the ""Freeway Killer"". Randy Kraft and William Bonin just became more famous than him and he got forgotten about."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fddwctl,t1_fdckaev,1578325587.0,Now that is perfect. She wants it.. she's got it..
serialkillers,fda4daf,t3_ek2q0b,1578241479.0,"I would recommend Angel of Darkness by Dennis MacDougal. It is about Randy Kraft and is a brilliant read. 
I would also recommend Perfect Victim by Carla Norton which is the story of Colleen Stan who was kept captive for 7 years. It's not a serial killer book but it's a great true crime book."
