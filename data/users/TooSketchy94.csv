PAstudent,ffp7yxf,t1_ffp1bqf,1580088495.0,"The short answer is yes. 

The long answer is - it really depends on the program. 

My program, and the university during my h see grad, was very technology heavy. However, some of my professors hated using technology in general and would go analog for a lot. I got by just fine with my iPad, MacBook, and 1 singular folder of scrap paper. :)"

Idk, I guess to me it’s harder to keep a recurring villain around than it is a “good” character. Though I suppose it’s possible if you look at the Reverse Flash on The Flash.

BatwomanTV,ffjgzgy,t1_ffjf2ti,1579998037.0,"I think it’ll be a straight up show down where Kate has to decide between letting Alice kill the new Beth or killing Alice to save the new Beth. It makes the most sense and would certainly make Kate a “haunted” type character similar to the Bruce Wayne we saw in the crossover. He even says “after your first kill, it changes” - so I could see that kill being her set up of a self-redemption arc similar to Oliver Queen over the seasons of Arrow."

I even posted about how the promotional material and incel-type fans (minority) initially turned me off to it. 

Even the new promo material still isn’t as good as the show is. Definitely think they should get someone else to do their promo material lol."
PAstudent,ffg9hxk,t3_etgqiq,1579901356.0,"A business card? 

I’ve honestly never had this experience... and haven’t heard of anyone in my program coming across it. I’ve had plenty of “Are you on linked-in?” And “Do you have a copy of your resume/CV?” But never asked about a business card. 

If you want to move forward with one, I suppose you could have whatever your bachelors was in “BS - Biology” and “PA-S” if you wanted? Plus of course all your contact information. I don’t really see a point when you’re going to be changing “S” to “C” in a relatively short amount of time. I guess I’d be concerned it made you look pretentious to have cards made up for your clinical rotations??

Just my thoughts."

Me and your dad are a lot alike, when we are scared and see those we love scared, our brains turn to logic - as that is what we understand best. We shut down the emotional part of ourselves and do our best to provide support by means of solutions. It's how we show support, but we know it isn't always what you need  and we try our best to do more, yet we fall short more times than not.

Let him know it's okay to just sit in silence while you cry, and that a hug and his presence is enough. Let him know he doesn't need to come up with a solution to every problem or be optimistic at all times. He'll appreciate the information, trust me.

I am so very sorry you're going through this, and I am SO glad you went to your GP to investigate this further. It is 100% OK to be scared, and to let others know you're scared. Something is in your body that shouldn't be and that's a fucking scary thing! You are normal and you are doing a damn fine job facing this new obstacle. You have already been so brave taking the first step of  investigating it, that I know you'll face anything else that comes, just as brave. Remember, we are here for support. It's okay to be scared, it's okay to be angry, but whatever you do - don't bottle it up!

HUGE HUGS Sib, you've got this <3"
physicianassistant,ffak3dj,t3_eskelw,1579737704.0,You’re using the ones I’ve heard of but I would also suggest Indeed and Zip Recruiter. Quite a few recruiters post to there. Also.

Usually, joining alliances helps a ton as they'll give random boosts or earn a boosted item of sorts. I typically load them onto my iPad rather than my phone so I can have it open while I'm working on other crap to prod it along. I try and avoid the ""reach X level fortress"" games because I get burnt out, lol. I typically do the games that are ""play X amount of rounds"" and do them as quickly as possible and delete the app.

hawks,fekq83a,t1_feko87s,1579205348.0,"The PK has gotten significantly better these last few games.

I would argue the PP has gotten better too, even if the score sheet doesn't reflect it. The puck is moving more, they are taking more chances from the blue line, going up the middle of the ice, all in all I think it looks better.

The defense in general looked really good last night. I know Montreal is a little offensively weak, but even so. Boq looked awesome last night, Gus didn't fuck up, and even Slater had, what I would argue as, his best game of the season! If the defense keeps it up, I'm confident when everyone is healthy - this run will continue."

hawks,feenztc,t3_eooyrj,1579037617.0,"Why not keep the A/B rotation alive?

I get he doesn’t want to be a back up but being an equal can’t be a bad move for him considering his play level this season and injury history. I have to imagine his agent will have a coming to Jesus talk with him that taking a semi-reduced contract to play A/B style with Lehner here in Chicago where he’s been for so long, is a good option. Short of a catastrophic injury, I don’t see teams chomping at the bit for him to replace their starter at a high salary. Not with his recent play level and certainly not with his concussion history.

I hope for his sake we finish decent in the standings this year and he gets what he wants from Stan Bo or somewhere else. We have to spend the funds on Lehner and I’m sad that Crow doesn’t seem open to doing what everyone else sees as the best move for his career."

I wish our PP would stop being so soft. We need a more consistent offense, to say the least. I know it gets said all the time, but we just need to be okay with shooting the puck and getting physical to get the rebounds. It seems like we hesitate to shoot for fear of giving up possession but getting pucks to the net is how you get those off hand bounce ins that games like tonight, we needed.

Personally, I think he’s more productive than Slater K on D and obviously on the score sheet. If he can’t get his shit together by the end of the season, I see him being a send off for prospects/future picks. Can’t ignore we need a stronger defensive presence and a more consistent offense and dropping Gus for some future options in the off season may be the best move to get those things accomplished."

Moviesinthemaking,fdhyr5n,t1_fdhxyjd,1578432604.0,"Really? I agree with you about the ending in general. It’s tough to get the explanation behind their ending, someone recommended a book that literally explains it - which I want to check out soon. 

I thought Matt Damon’s character made a lot of sense in turning evil. It’s been a little bit since I’ve seen the film but I remember thinking it makes total sense for him to want to save himself, and be heralded a hero, so he set a trap and executed it to near perfection. Not to mention what being isolated like that does to someone’s psyche. It was like if his character from the Martian went the complete other way in terms of sanity, which I liked. I also liked how it felt completely out of nowhere because he was that convincing in his lies. 

I have to disagree with sacrificing everything to save everyone compared to sacrificing half of everyone to secure half the future being unrealistic. I think the more as time goes on, people are more apt to choose what they consider the less selfish option of making a last ditch effort rather to save everyone than certainly dooming a select group in hopes of saving the other group. Just my personal view on future generations and current generation public views."

As far as things to look at, I wish I would’ve known more antibiotics off the top of my head. Not even dose, just coverage of all of them in general.

My program is kind of toxic as far as people being competitive about grades and faculty pretending they give a shit just to call you in and say “try harder”. 

My GPA currently, before clinical grades, is a 3.28. I’ve heard from many people you can save your GPA in clinical year but remember, nobody cares as long as you pass. Don’t put pressure on yourself to get a 3.8 or whatever. Passing is passing and no matter what you get on your EORs, you’re sitting for the PANCE just like everyone else. 

I also do way better in the clinical setting and it’s been noticed. I’ve had 2 rotations, and with those, 2 job offers. You know your strengths and it’s OK it isn’t taking tests. Mine isn’t either and yet I’m confident I will be a good provider, just like you should be. Maybe shake up your study habits?

Did they do something stupid? Absolutely. Who hasn’t done something stupid during their teenage years? I’d argue on the scale of stupidity, this ranks pretty low compared to what they could’ve done and certainly compared to what other teenagers are currently doing out in the world. 

I think it’s fair to say the homeowner is the one who demanded they come back as he mentions they have a teenage daughter who told them after the fact of the damages incurred. It could be he didn’t specify that the daughter was the one that demanded they come and get the fish out, but I’m betting it was a pissed off father of a teenage girl who’s done her own stupid shit and thought this would both teach the kids a lesson and get him off the hook of paying for someone to professionally catch the fish or worse, doing it himself. I think the moment he invited them onto the property to retrieve the fish, he accepted some form of liability. Also, as some other posters have mentioned - where were the parents? Did the homeowner actually supervise this retrieval or were the kids and these strangers left to their own devices? 

In my mind, the homeowner - short of video footage, can’t prove damage to the fountain/sprinkler post catfish retrieval was done by the kids. Had he not had them come back to the property, he could’ve broke it his damn self and then claimed the kids broke it putting the fish in it originally, but now that they have proof, phone records/messages (I’m assuming), that they were invited to the property and they are all witnesses to their being more than just them there - in the pond hunting for the fish, I think it’s a tough case for the homeowner. 

I hope the teenagers were dumb enough to attempt to Snapchat or post on Instagram the retrieval mission because then there is proof in video/picture of others on the scene and hopefully, of the intact fountain when they are near it. I don’t think felony vandalism is necessary, but I completely support a civil suit where the homeowner attempts to recoup damages from the parties parents or from the strangers if it comes to light they are the ones who broke those items. I’m curious if the strangers were neighbors and the homeowner wasn’t real sure who they were either so he’s going after the teens he does know through his daughter."

I’m concerned if Nylander puts on weight, he’ll lose one of his few redeeming factors of speed. Thoughts?"
hawks,fcohc3w,t1_fcoa212,1577832237.0,"I’m sad he hasn’t been able to really capitalize on any of it. I thought for sure after that sweet goal from the Kane feed, he’d take off. Yet he fizzled out quite a bit more. Even Pat and Eddy talk about it during the broadcasts."

I know it doesn’t mean much, but I’m sharing everything I can to keep exposure on the fires as high as possible. Hoping aide and able bodied volunteers come to you guys as soon as possible. 

I can’t even imagine. Thinking of you guys always."
beermoney,fcnwo1g,t3_ei4owg,1577819940.0,All is fine with mine here in the Midwest (US). Wonder what that’s about? Was hoping to get another cash out before they decide to close shop all together. Wish there were more driving apps like it!
beermoney,fcnuk23,t1_fcnrgzr,1577818706.0,Exactly how I feel. I went out and bought one of those little coupon holder accordion things for $1 and it’s been a life saver. I have it organized by the apps that need the receipts the soonest first to the ones that need it last. It’s a safe place for all my receipts to go and keeps me organized to maximize earnings. Highly recommend!
beermoney,fcnq16n,t1_fcnme64,1577816273.0,"It’s NCP ReCap. I had never heard of it till I saw it mentioned on this sub a few times yesterday. I uploaded 10 receipts (the max for the week) and it credited all of them by this morning. They just have to be within the last 14 days. Which is the same time frame as fetch so I just scanned the ones I had for fetch, and it worked great. Haven’t gotten to cash out yet as it’s a 5,000 point cash out with a max of 500 a week. Has the opportunity to make more if your purchases trigger a survey. Figured it’s just as “slow” as an earner as all my receipt apps and decided to add it to my list.

Edit: forgot to address the app issues. I saw those issues reported too and I haven’t had any problems. I’m on the latest iOS on an iPhone 7 and it worked really smooth. Seem to have ironed out the bugs."
beermoney,fcnb1ce,t1_fcmzmr1,1577807763.0,"Ahh makes sense. I didn’t even realize how old the comment was. Searched the sub for “coinout” cause I noticed when I tried to cash out today, they changed it from once per week to one per 2 weeks."
beermoney,fcmyb54,t1_f6nyvjw,1577797474.0,"I’ve seen a bunch of people mention not getting to $25 on coinout. Why does anyone want to get that high? I set the limit for myself at $1 and as soon as I hit that, I transfer it to my high interest savings account specifically set up for BeerMoney funds. I’m on iOS, if that makes a difference."
beermoney,fcmy871,t1_f6pjeho,1577797383.0,"Surveys are based on purchases. 

I get them constantly for alcohol and energy drink purchases! It makes cashing out much faster. I cash out receipt hog at least twice a month."
beermoney,fcmxwiu,t1_fckvlv9,1577797032.0,"Exactly this.

I use Receipt Hog, Receipt Pal, Fetch, Ibotta, CoinOut, and now NCP - just keep track of dates. Receipt hog, fetch, and Coinout all accept within 14 days where as Receipt Pal and Ibotta are more like within the last 7 days."
beermoney,fcmxsfu,t1_fckn4e3,1577796908.0,"It is on iOS. I downloaded it yesterday and uploaded the 10 receipt max for the week - it accepted and credited all of them no problem. 

Looks like 1,000 = $1, need 5,000 to cash out. Max of 500 points a week. Bit of a slow earner, just like all the receipt apps - so I’m happy to add this one to my receipt cycle."

Flipping,fckgi1d,t3_ehlalz,1577724809.0,"Listed my first 2 items on eBay today!

Hoping they sell quickly! I went ahead and selected eBay to calculate my shipping costs and charge accordingly. I remembered from this sub that USPS offers free shipping supplies for priority mail items. After a quick google search, I see I can't just use those boxes for any kind of USPS shipping - am I correct in that? I went ahead and selected the cheapest option for shipping through eBay so I'm going to use boxes I have around the house from the holidays, if my items sell. Just want to make sure I'm not sleeping on free boxes. 

Any other general shipping tips are appreciated as well!"
hockey,fcj1dso,t1_fcj0ge8,1577674854.0,"Agree with all of it.

I’m also a hawks fan and I wasn’t aware they didn’t get time put back on - I didn’t catch the whistle. That’s honestly, shitty on the leagues end. While we can’t know if the Hawks would’ve played the exact same way with that extra 1.1 seconds put back on but, if they did - CBJ wins the game and keep their goalie. 

I’m happy we got the 2 points and Lehner can finally feel a bit better about shoot outs. But. It doesn’t feel good to win this way, and for CBJ to lose a player to boot. :\"
hawks,fciqcc1,t1_fcip24v,1577667303.0,I said that to my wife too. Near the 1-1:20 mark they were just sitting on the puck and it felt like they thought they could take the SO W. That didn’t work out well for them.
