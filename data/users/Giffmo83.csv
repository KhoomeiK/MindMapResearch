You can feel the sound in your chest and it's momentarily terrifying."
Whatcouldgowrong,ffss26f,t1_ffslwmf,1580190403.0,"It wasn't a car horn. It was an air horn, used for trains, sometimes ambulances, etc
They are INSANELY loud. A car horn isn't even a vague comparison. 
You can absolutely suffer hearing loss from them.
People that use them are always behind them and usually have something between the horn bad them as well. This was pointed at her face and just a couple feet away. 
Fuck this guy."
todayilearned,fds51qt,t1_fdrptne,1578694516.0,"Maybe, but that sounds like it could be a other things too. (Less likely things, obviously) The scenario is a plane if cardiologists. They're sticklers."
todayilearned,fdrlial,t1_fdrixua,1578686300.0,"More than nurses. 
And, again, no application to those who aren't healthcare providers."
todayilearned,fdr8bhe,t1_fdr3xur,1578680881.0,"Although it isn't always clear on search, the AHA website clearly states that ACLS is for healthcare professionals. 
The requirements also states that it requires the recognition of EKG rhythms. 
When I went through paramedic school, we spent 5 months learning that, and many students were still shaky at that point. 

Additionally, the medications taught in ACLS are powerful and can be dangerous if improperly used. Respectfully, I *am* an ""expert"" and can assure you in no uncertain terms that someone could never be authorized to use them after a 2-3 day class."
todayilearned,fdr27is,t1_fdqt1mm,1578678457.0,Not correct. Flight attendants cannot administer medications because they are not licensed to do so. ACLS certification is not the same as being a licensed healthcare provider.
todayilearned,fdqzc9z,t1_fdqoy02,1578677295.0,"That sounds nice, but it's bullshit. No ""drips"" will treat ""control"" an MI. They likely gave saline."
todayilearned,fdqwsh4,t1_fdqvaav,1578676000.0,"Your point further process my point. Layperson CPR and an AED were the important functions there. 

While Epi is still standard practice, it's highly controversial because, among other reasons, there's no evidence of any benefit from epi during cardiac arrest."
todayilearned,fdqv08c,t1_fdqtwbr,1578675207.0,"Honestly those docs would likely do aspirin and good luck. 
The AED has it's purpose, but my comments were and are about a *heart attack*. 
Which cannot be diagnosed on a plane full of cardiologists. And cannot be treated any more effectively. 

It makes for a nice story. That's about it. 

If someone codes from an untreated heart attack, it's unlikely the have a realistic chance if recovery. And *if* they do, their chance lies in effective compressions which doctors aren't any more qualified to do than any CPR trained bystander."
todayilearned,fdqtq35,t1_fdqt6nl,1578674677.0,"Ok, you've got one lead. Probably lead II. Congratulations. 
That absolutely cannot identify literally any infarction, and very questionable ability to determine any other rhythm."
todayilearned,fdqt7fg,t1_fdqrl57,1578674362.0,None of which contradict my point.
todayilearned,fdqt1k2,t1_fdqseak,1578674262.0,"1) I was responding to the specifics you listed. 
2) you're no longer talking about treating an MI, are you? 
3) on what basis are you interpreting these rhythms? There's no way of knowing what rhythm they are in."
todayilearned,fdqqx1i,t1_fdqp1u7,1578672962.0,"Hey, look, someone is paying attention. Thanks."
todayilearned,fdqqthu,t1_fdqpljg,1578672902.0,All useless for myocardial infarction aka heart attack.
todayilearned,fdqqpfr,t1_fdqp5n5,1578672832.0,"An AED might help if she dies, but useless for the heart attack."
todayilearned,fdqqmxc,t1_fdqofqq,1578672791.0,"Without an EKG or blood work, they'd really still be speculating that it's *probably* a heart attack."
dataisbeautiful,f7fmtz1,t1_f7flb5a,1573682826.0,"Well you make it easy for me to point out your ignorance. 

But maybe you'll get better once you're out of high school. One can hope."
