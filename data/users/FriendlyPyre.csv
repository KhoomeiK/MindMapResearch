It really does seem like from what you're saying, it IS adjustment issues; though it seems rather severe compared to the ""usual"".

&#x200B;

Also your post isn't very informative; could you clarify:

1. Do you mean you enlisted and then got medical leave on the third day of enlistment? i.e. you haven't spent a week in camp let alone a weekend?
2. When you met the MO and counsellor, did you mention your suicidal thoughts?

Also, further questions to understand you:

1. What's your education background? (i.e. ITE/Poly/JC/IB)
2. Ever failed a paper or had to repeat a module/subject?

Lastly, on what you can do/consider right now:

1. get used to a 7 hour sleep cycle, this is normal for the military at large; even if you downpes, this remains a **constant.**
2. Find a hobby to anchor your in reality so that when you book in, you have something to look forward to; reading, writing, drawing, watching movies, etc.
3. Prepare yourself to head back into camp when your medical leave expires; if you're not chao geng, it will naturally be obvious to your PS/PC. Just do as required, don't think too much or too far; if you have the ""days to ORD"" App installed on your phone, get rid of it. Bottom line: Don't think about the end when you're at the start.
4. BMT is only a relatively short time, designed to break you down and build you up stronger; after your BMT you will find ways to get more rest (on the sly or otherwise). 
5. Talk to your buddy about it when you get back to camp; you'll be counting on each other during BMT, count on him and  let him be comfortable to count on you.

&#x200B;

>He wakes the whole barracks and calls his battle buddy's, our female drill had just put her 4yr down for the night, and the call wakes her up, who for affectionate terms well call baby drill, 

Duty DS gets the Barracks to wake up; the random ""battle buddy's"" is ambiguous but should be the female DS. 

Next part, ""call wakes her up""; seems to be the baby of the DS that was relieved by the ""current"" Duty DS.

After which the jarring entry of ""mama drill"" and ""baby drill""; mama being the female drill and baby being her kid. (Aka too much random detail that doesn't add to the story and just confuses)

>while he wait on the other drills, the duty drill secured a spot lite on the spider,

Secured a spotlight, aka ""spider"" was likely told to stay up there on the wall and a spotlight was illuminating her.

> the females were then taken out by mama and baby drill for a smoke session lead by baby drill, 

to smoke/to beast/to tekan: generally involves screaming, shouting, intimidation, (some times) punishments in order to instil discipline through breaking down and building up of a person.

>while mama drill is educationing the wemon on policing of there battle buddy's, seems later our spider had meant accidents in the shower.

Female DS told recruits to keep their own battle buddies in line; bathroom justice dealt to ""spider"" by relevant recruits.

>My wife enlisted back in 2000, at the start her battle buddy was a girl (for ref, **Spider**) she didn't get along with; Though she managed to get her DS(for ref, **DS Smokey**) to switch her battle buddy. Some time after, **Spider** was caught climbing the barracks wall.  
>  
>What had happened was, **DS Smokey** had gone for a smoke break during his Duty Shift and happened to look up; catching **Spider** in the act of climbing up to the men's bunks on the 2nd floor, presumably to fraternise with one of the male enlistees.  
>  
>**DS Smokey** assembles the enlistees and sends for the other DSes. Whilst waiting on the other DSes, **DS Smokey** secures a spotlight and illuminates **Spider**; who was still up on the wall. The Female enlistees were soon taken out by a Female DS, smoked, and told to keep their battle buddies in line; All this whilst holding her 4 year old who had been waken up by the muster.   
>  
>Some time after the incident, **Spider** was dealt barracks justice; Predictably, **Spider** did not make it due to her failure to adapt.

If you're speaking of the combat usage, likely none since you'd prefer to maintain your energy and speed; unless of course you happen to be Maverick and want to ""slam on the brakes so they fly right by"". Then maybe it might hold some use."

No punishment though. Unlike all other countries."
