Wake at 7, but get out of bed at 7:15. Take my morning poo which I take too long to do cuz I’m scrolling through Reddit. Realize I’m running late and try to scramble and get out the apartment and go to work. Get to work at like 8:40 and get home around 5:30. 

Take my after work poo, chill, hydrate and go to gym at 6 and return at 7. Drink protein shake, shower and eat dinner. Prolly watch an ep on Netflix and hop on Xbox and bed by 11:30."

I miss the college lifestyle with great flexibility and freedom but my mental health ranked those four years. Now my weeks have way more routine which consist of work, gym, and a couple hours of Xbox before bedtime. It kinda sucks but I’m in a much better place mentally. I make the most of my weekends and plan out when I can take a week or two off where I can travel or do stuff."
