PMDD,ffn2as9,t3_eu4gx1,1580061217.0,"FWIW, I'm 25 and my mother was also abusive- she has Munchausens by proxy. 

The first question I want to ask is if the psych ward helped or if it made things worse. Psych wards are great places to seek safety when you no longer feel mentally safe, but they're not the answer for everyone. Did your mom lie because YOU didn't like the psych ward or because SHE didn't?

Second, I agree that you should tell your psychiatrist next time you see them - but make sure you tell them why you weren't truthful last time. Your doctor needs to know that your mother asked you to lie. She interfered with your healthcare.

From there, if you're the one with concerns about the psych ward, bring up those concerns - there are more comfortable treatment options/psych facilities not tied to a general hospital, and if these are local, you may have access to them. Ask about residential treatment centers (they're usually a couple of weeks to a couple of months long, and they're less intense than a psych ward while still providing many hours of treatment and constant safety). Somr places even have respite centers where you can go and seek safe shelter in a mental health crisis - they're not medical facilities. Something to look into if your struggle is exclusively PMDD, as it's like a place to decompress for a night or two.

If you do want to go to the psych ward, will your psychiatrist arrange for transport or will your mom have to bring you? If that responsibility falls on your mom and she won't bring you, do you have a friend or a friend's parent who can? If you do choose the psych ward, I cannot stress this enough: TELL THEM THAT YOU DO NOT FEEL MENTALLY SAFE AT HOME. If your mom's abuse is contributing to your worsening mental health, they can help you - potentially arrange for you to stay with a relative. 

I'm so glad you've chosen to seek help despite your mom, and I wish you luck. My inbox is open if you have questions or need to talk <3"

I have BPD, PMDD and PTSD and my birth control was prescribed for mental health. Forgot to list that I also take fish oil. I did spend 8 weeks in residential and transitional living treatment in 2019, where they did genetic testing and concluded that the way I metabolize medications (of all kinds - I had to stop a genetic condition treatment when I was a kid, too) was part of the reason I was having some debilitating mental health issues, like needing 12 hours of sleep but being tired all day. Makes sense seeing as I was previously prescribed and yanked off of maybe a dozen MH meds, 2-3 endocrinology meds and even some antibiotics.

They had me on Zoloft but said it can't be long term anymore. Saw a psychiatrist on the outside who was similarly concerned- she wanted to see me use the skills I learned in treatment all these years instead. So I haven't been on a traditional psych med in a few months whereas I had spent 10 years on them before. I really thought I had everything under control, but honestly I haven't really exercised since being unmedicated. So I guess I hadn't actually tried to put myself under physical stress.

I'm currently looking into chamomile supplements or tea for anxiety attacks along with reviewing everything I learned. Also haven't tried CBD yet. Just nervous to see a psychiatrist again when the obvious suggestion would be medication, but medication has routinely made my life unmanageable by keeping me out of work and stuck in bed.

It's not the fault of the religious texts for the way people think. For every religious teaching that promotes hate, there's another that promotes love. Over the years, people have stuck to the teachings that confirm their existing hatred - almost everyone with hateful views has a reason beyond religion for having them.

But people are already changing with the times. I think you'll find that there are more loving Christians than hateful, more Muslims who detest terrorism than those who don't, more Jews who would want a circumcision performed in a hospital, or at least not have the rabbi suck the blood out. Those who do want circumcision have been told there are health benefits to it (and that's not a Jewish teaching - that's something all US parents have been taught at some point). Hell, look at Judaism - there are so many interpretations of the teachings that there's hardly a ""right"" way to be a Jew. These religions and their people ARE evolving.

mentalhealth,fen8dq3,t3_eps8f3,1579279211.0,"I'm really glad you had a positive experience as it's pretty rare. I was so traumatized by my stay that I wound up going to residential treatment.

I was treated like a prisoner, like I committed a crime. I later learned that prisoners in maximum security prisons have more privileges and services than mental health hospital patients. Yelled at every time I asked questions like ""may I ask what the purpose of this blood test is"" and even had my wheelchair taken away from me despite not being able to walk for another few weeks (fractured and dislocated ankle plus surgery) because I was ""faking it"" and ""needed the exercise."" A patient stabbed another patient while I was there and the nurses were trying to correct how I told my dad. When he arrived, police were on site and told him the story exactly as I told him. Another patient ODd while I was there.

No nice showers, comfy beds, or phone detox could make up for that treatment, and I'm not alone. A study just came out saying that if you go to a hospital for self harm, you are 57 TIMES more likely to die by suicide the following year - 34 times more likely if you went for suicidal thoughts.

If it's the only thing in the area, by all means go because it's safer than being left to your own devices. A lot of US cities are actually opening up respite centers that aren't hospitals - they're simply safe places to go in crisis. As they aren't medical facilities, you might not even encounter bills. I told myself that I would rather die than go back to the hospital, so I'm glad these places are opening up.

I grew up in an affluent area. Working after college, the military, and trade schools were not seen as options in my community- you were seen as a failure if you took those routes. The same for community college. Not only was it seen as a sign of poverty and a last-ditch effort if you couldn't get into college, but the school sucked. After high school, you were to go to a 4-year school. The teachers didn't acknowledge other options. We all went to college because parents and teachers were all on board.

A good number of people dropped out because school was not for them. The kids whose parents forced college wound up jobless and degreeless. Others are in crippling debt because they can't get a job with their ""lucrative"" degree. The kids we all saw as failures for not going to college now make far more than us. Teachers want you to work hard to not become the garbage man, but won't tell you that the garbage man makes twice as much as them.

The school system fails when it doesn't recognize other options and doesn't work within a student's strengths. You're basing success on going to college, but a student can succeed in a school system if they're taught to use their strengths to be productive in society. But as long as the school systems and teachers don't recognize all work as success, students can't embrace their definition of smart"

The issue here is that you're associating these things with masculinity, as though femininity doesn't allow for that. It's got nothing to do with your masculinity. It has to do with being handy, being good at sports, or hitting the gym.

The toxicity here is that if these things are masculine, the opposite must be feminine. You say you're not looking down on men who don't do these things, but in saying they make you masculine, you're also saying they make other men not masculine if they don't do them.

I think we're just afraid to admit that these things are some people's realities. Bringing it to light and actually describing a situation thorugh literature isn't normalizing it - it's framing it in a way that makes you realize that it isn't acceptable or normal. Since we're talking about how gross it is to equate a 12-year-old's sobs with an orgasm, this passage succeeded at addressing the issue.

We can also ask what ""normal"" means and whether or not normal equals acceptable. I can think of a lot of situations that many kids find themselves in that maybe shouldn't be acceptable, yet are still ""normal"" in that most people have experienced it. But that's a separate issue"

How do we decide what's okay to write about and what isn't? This author is portraying a seriously fucked up situation, but how do we know that wasn't the point? This is page 4. We have no further context here that talks about why they were so explicit.

Not every book is going to tell you how you should feel about an event; you have to keep reading to see how it affects the characters. Does the brother realize he fucked up? Does the girl develop maladaptive coping skills or struggle after this? Does she go on to think it's normal until the very end? Do other characters notice anything?

I just think there's a very thick line between a purposefully erotic passage and one with sexual elements. Getting deep into the mind of an abuser or victim and briefly stepping in their shoes shouldn't be off-limits because the situation is fucked up.
