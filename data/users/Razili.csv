cats,fdirilk,t1_fdiqecc,1578449423.0,Can you rehome some of the cats?  If you don’t have the space for the litter boxes then you can’t reasonably keep your cats healthy and happy.  Also tell your extended family to keep their cats at home as you don’t have the space.

I switched to a hardwood pellets (like you use in a pellet furnace).  Both my cats like it and in my area I can get a 40# bag for about 6 dollars."
