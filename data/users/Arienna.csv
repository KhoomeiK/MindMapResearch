Then he would make us write an explanation for how we'd convinced ourselves our answer was correct.

AmItheAsshole,fecvn11,t1_fecnd4b,1578986416.0,"Let me tell you a story about roller derby! Roller derby is a full contact sport played in roller skates and we spend the whooooole time in a squat position for stability  reasons. So my friend and I (both girls) were at the boys' practice. We were doing an exercise where everyone was skating in a paceline and the person in the back of the line would sprint up, hit the person in the front and take their place. After she hit me and got in front of me, I noticed she'd split the seam of her pants, right square at her backside. So I told her, real quick, and she stood bolt upright, clapping her hands over her exposed bottom

...which is right when the next guy plowed into her.

I felt like a monster but she thanked me for telling her and we briefly tried to improvise a solution that involved stuffing a sock down her pants until someone found a spare pair of shorts.

explainlikeimfive,fecsyoc,t1_fecsfci,1578983412.0,"Yes xD On my spinning wheels! I usually deal with already washed and carded/combed wool but there's a traditional competition called ""Sheep to Shawl"" where teams of craftspeople take freshly sheared fleeces, card, spin, and weave it into a shawl in a few hours. The shawls are then judged and we usually auction them off for charity. 

The fleeces aren't washed yet so, depending on the breed, they can have a lot of lanolin in them. That's where lanolin comes from, sheep ooze it just like humans get greasy hair. It gives them waterproofing, temperature control, repel insects and probably a bunch of other stuff. 

Fun fact: the world gets most of it's vitamin D3 from processing lanolin. If you take vitamins you're probably ingesting sheep ooze."

Not entirely because if how he dressed but because he broke many unspoken rules of appropriate behavior - conforming to the dress code was only one if those rules. He would stare too long at women, invite himself into situations he wasn't wanted in. Wearing suits did not coincide with regularly dry cleaning the suits so there was a slightly sloppy and unpleasant smell. He was generally pretty creepy and unsettling.

AmItheAsshole,fcq1uhd,t1_fcptbzw,1577876917.0,"For a few reasons! But here's a couple big ones for addicts:

An addict presented with an ultimatum doesn't actually want to get clean, they just want to avoid the consequences. Sort of like telling a kid if they don't clean their room they'll get grounded. This doesn't make the kid want to clean their room, so they'll probably push the mess under the bed or in a closet instead of doing the work. If you present an addict with an ultimatum there's a very good chance they'll just get sneakier about their use so they can keep using and avoid the consequences.

If the addict *does* try to get clean for the person who's placed the ultimatum, their sobriety now revolves around that person. What happens if you have to start doing something awful, like clean the toilet with your toothbrush because your mom said if you don't, you'll never see her again. And then one day your mom disappears even though you've been doing it the whole time... Are you going to keep cleaning the toilet with your toothbrush?"

It's very hard, when you're an adult to try something that's so difficult and takes years of practice that you have to do in front of people. I mean, you have to be bad and amateur in front of people. Big oof.

My family loves that I play cello so when I visit I take my instrument and show my dad what I've been working on. I'm shy about it so I play in the other room. But my dad likes to listen to me. So I said I was going to to go practice and my boyfriend of nine months *put his fingers in his ears* and grinned at me. He absolutely meant it as a joke but it was incredibly hurtful. I told him I don't have room for jokes on such a sensitive subject and he apologized immediately.

But it's still a hurt. I don't practice around him. I don't invite him to my recitals. I worry too much when he's around that he hates my playing. It is an insecurity now. But he's genuinely remorseful and a kind, thoughtful partner who regrets hurting my feelings so he's worth keeping. We'll get over this in time when I'm less anxious about my music.

Talk to your partner about your feelings. If he's genuinely remorseful to have hurt you, he will apologize and try to soothe the damage his carelessness has caused. If he ignores your hurt to protect his right to make mean jokes think about that very carefully before you marry him."
