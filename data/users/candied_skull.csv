It's possibly a cure to the ""FEV Sample"" also added by that mod? Or could be a leveled list conflict? You can always drop it, although it looks like quite a valuable (therefore potentially economy unbalancing)

It you want to make a patch to it, open it up it XEdit and it's under SuperMutantRedux>Misc Item>SMR\_MISC\_SuperMutantCure02\_New, as well as one another one that is ""Fev Cure, battered"" under SuperMutantRedux>Misc Item>SMR\_MISC\_SuperMutantCure02\_Rusty and you can just adjust the value or whatever in a patch. Or edit a level list if you don't want it appearing?

Nothing has to necessary be permanent, but imagine him having to take that injury into account and struggling with his identity as ""the cook"" if he can't fulfill all his duties.
