todayilearned,ffzj7ya,t1_ffzgp3s,1580381862.0,Some people are unbelievably stubborn. Their hate drives all of their rhetoric. The lend lease program and US contribution in materials and lives during WW2 is heavily documented and not disputed.

tooktoomuch,ffscgp6,t1_ffsaogz,1580178409.0,Thank you for saying that. I guess I did pick the wrong sub to make my point. The more I saw OP's  posts the sadder I got. Sorry guys.
tooktoomuch,ffs9o7r,t1_ffs6z5s,1580176540.0,Genetics? I really wish drug addiction would be protected like any other disability. I can see from this post that it will never happen. Thanks for making me see the stigma lives on. I'm sure I was born this way doesn't hold any weight for the LBGTQ+ community either. Double standards abound.

Edit: Just saying it's a little Overkill at this point. I'm a former addict and can get a little bitter that everyone else is protected but we are shit on even though medical professionals have recognized it as a disease."

nfl,ffrm65d,t1_ffr0uwe,1580160907.0,"I love how it's an easy karma grab when it pertains to the Steelers. It was just reported and OP posted it.

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffgo3hc,t1_ffcsphj,1579910779.0,"Probably because you can't cash a check at any bank without matching funds. That was dumb of the bank manager to disclose his balance. If you hope for that, enjoy all the fees they will pass on to you. The bank will never take a loss."

atheism,ff1xuz8,t1_ff0xoqi,1579488665.0,Nice edit. I have never required anything to believe in to be a good person. All I am saying is what is the harm of me personally  thinking the people I love and myself will meet again? As long as I don't belong to one of your hated churches and try to love everyone I meet!
