funkopop,ffi9gx6,t3_etqshb,1579968507.0,Deku would definitely browse this sub irl!
AskReddit,ffgu2v2,t1_fffjld5,1579915080.0,"Kebab shop employees earned their right to say boss. Thank you for your kebabs, sir."
japanlife,ffgtxb9,t1_ffgod3l,1579914967.0,"I’d be interested in this too if you get more info, thanks."
japanlife,ffgr1hl,t1_ffgiuxo,1579912874.0,"Gotcha good to know, thank you!"
japanlife,ffgionu,t1_ffg4ren,1579907125.0,As a soon to be grad who speaks good Japanese...is this extremely common? Cause if so I’m about to reach out to recruiters there and hope I get lucky. I’m interested in IT but don’t have an IT related major.
ChoosingBeggars,fffmuv9,t3_et5j3h,1579887371.0,I do my siblings laundry as a favor and they do the same to me. Smh
Tinder,fffbt5t,t1_ffetrkv,1579880503.0,Like the other guy says dating apps are shallow. Irl you’ll see guys of various heights with women so it’s not that big of a deal.
unpopularopinion,fffak1m,t3_et1i5i,1579879703.0,Some middle aged lady picked a fight with my dad when he said yes ma’am in response to a question she asked. I guess it made her feel older than she is but it’s a title of respect how do people get offended by being respected. I didn’t get the logic in that.
unpopularopinion,fffaavr,t1_ffev9us,1579879541.0,Enlisted is rank + last name! Officers are sir/ma’am.
funkopop,ffeorw1,t1_ffeoevb,1579857841.0,As Funko Pops create more things from different shows/movies/games I think we’ll slowly get more collectors and casual buyers ending up here! For example I’m new here only because I found out there were My Hero Academia funkos!
funkopop,ffeopon,t3_emo0xw,1579857748.0,I got 13 coming in the mail from the MHA series...!
funkopop,ffeoa98,t3_et7n86,1579857092.0,"Sorry, I’m not sure about the mystery boxes or subscription boxes. But I wanted to comment to say I agree with wishing there were more posts! It’s fun seeing everyone’s collections and how they’ve organized them! Best thing about this sub is seeing the variety of pops available - some which I’d never even see if it weren’t for this sub!"
povertyfinance,ffe2soq,t3_esv6lr,1579835213.0,"Yeah, but my parents worked extremely hard raising us and tbh I would be sad if they didn’t accept my help. I’m hoping to give them a comfortable in their older age so they can finally relax once they retire."
funkopop,ffe0vfh,t1_ffddqqx,1579833807.0,As he should be lol
u_Andromeda321,ffdd2lz,t3_eszo1v,1579818324.0,Thank you!
funkopop,ffdcwae,t1_ffdby73,1579818215.0,I’m guilty of paying a little extra for faster delivery too haha. Thanks for the reply! I’m starting a collection of this series too so I’ve been  curious what each normally go for!
funkopop,ffdb47m,t3_esxd6s,1579817059.0,Sweet! mind sharing how much you paid for each? At least the Mei and Mirio I’m curious about!
funkopop,ffdauz9,t3_esxtnw,1579816889.0,Is that... the ape titan?
japanlife,ffbxj8f,t3_esr15s,1579785977.0,Classes are the best route and more exposure to English at home from media would also help a lot once she finds herself at an okay level. But with someone who doesn’t know any English at all then English classes are the best option from here in my opinion.
japanlife,ffbh6ba,t1_ffbgvug,1579765109.0,Thank you for the replies! That makes more sense to assess the language level of an applicant. Thanks again for sharing that info and for giving me some hope.
japanlife,ffbgoaa,t1_ffbggld,1579764475.0,"Interesting, so there is a chance. May I ask if JLPT certification even mattered when you applied?"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,ffbgjko,t3_esfvfj,1579764311.0,Found out I might graduate sooner than I thought and am now in a frenzy trying to think of jobs I should be applying for!? It’s so difficult not being able to ask anyone in real life. But I’ll be the first in my family to get a degree so that’s pretty awesome.
japanlife,ffbg7nn,t1_ffay9vr,1579763895.0,Oh wow first I’ve heard of this service! I’ve got N2 certification and really want to work in Japan but I’m majoring in public health and highly doubt I’d be able to find some sort of entry level position at an office with this degree. But I’m still going to try! Hopefully some company could use a bilingual person in HR/other administrative role.
funkopop,ffbfr7h,t3_eso5nh,1579763330.0,"I see All Might, I’ve got to upvote. I’m just getting into this and I’m almost as crazy as you. Except you’ve got 1 more funko than me so far!"
funkopop,ffbfobn,t3_esp4r9,1579763234.0,I feel so patriotic just looking at that! What are those sealed boxes underneath in the bottom shelf by the way?
funkopop,ffbfmbr,t3_espfmf,1579763166.0,Which pop is it?
JapanTravel,ffb92lq,t1_ff9350m,1579755655.0,Thank you! I’ll be saving up more and planning what I’ll be doing accordingly once I get a better idea of my budget. Lodging is really the biggest issue. I wish I had family around there or something and this wouldn’t have been as big of a deal!
malelivingspace,ff9ha3w,t1_ff9dd6d,1579712994.0,It’ll just be dudes like me who use a box for a coffee table posting here.
JapanTravel,ff85cxn,t1_ff85520,1579666434.0,Oh yeah I just edited my post a couple seconds after you commented. Ik even capsule hotels are probably going to go for $100 a night. I’m sort of new to all this so I just automatically assumed I’d stay in Tokyo since my classes are there but didn’t think of finding lodging in like Saitama city or other nearby places.
