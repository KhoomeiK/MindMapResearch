I have been offered bread rolls by waiters walking by and, although I didn’t order it, I assume is part of the service and I take a second or two to pick one I like. It is not complimentary; its cost is included in the price of the dish. The bread is expected.
Now, if the fruit is unexpected, a treat, then I’d be grateful and say thanks. If it is standard practice, I would not consider the waiter’s words polite. I wouldn’t go batshit Karen on him (nobody deserves that) but I would say that this is something I look forward to as part of the meal and that I want to choose one I like.

He did a walk through in five minutes, explained to me a few things about the code, replaced one outlet in two minutes, and charged his hourly fee, which was not cheap.

woodworking,fed0soj,t1_fec1wz3,1578992960.0,"I am sorry but I disagree with your math. If the artisan is doing the work him or herself, there are no wages involved. It makes no sense to compute wages and profits for a single-person enterprise. There are fixed costs (tools, space),  variable  costs (materials), and labor. Or are you going to compute the opportunity cost of making the product, pricing this cost as a market rate hourly wage at a job that the artisan can realistically work at? 
Unless this person makes $10 at another job, that is not what his time is worth (adding or subtracting the value of pleasure into the rate).
Without an investor of some sort (which may invest in non-monetary ways), there is no profit.

Edit: make the hourly rate $1000 and the argument still holds. This is microeconomic theory. But that is assuming a rational decision-maker. I see people every day not understand what maximizing utility/satisfaction vs profit means. And no, not everyone wants to be a capitalist. Some people enjoy and prefer self-employment."

For the comparison to the Lion King, what made the show far far far superior to the film was the use of Indonesian puppetry for the sake of spectacle.
