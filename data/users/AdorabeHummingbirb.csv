Also, you seem to have a wrong idea of how feminists use “toxic masculinity”. To advocate for oppression is sexist, it should be a genderless term, women can and do it too [personally I find the term “toxic masculinity” itself scum, and anyone you uses it un ironically ], let me “mansplain” you, why I have issues with the term. I see this a lot but I need to focus on one event to show the issue: I was reading a conversation on R/feminism once, some case of f on m violence showed up and they were talking about male victims of domestic violence, no one talked about the abuser and one feminist suggested that due to “toxic masculinity” men do not speak about abuse, soon, a lot of women started pitching into that comment and the discussion turned about asshole abusive men, we went from this to that. Now, if it were a *female*, *woman* victim of abuse, here’s what I’ve seen happen; they actually talk about the abuser, how vile he is, wish harm upon him, and say that abuse makes you less likely to speak up. I see similar themes and lines of thinking all over, and everything reeks of it. 

Once in trollX, women were complaining (it was meme posted, and some comment said what I am approx. quoting) “a man can just get out the door, walk to his car and drive away, I need to be scared the moment I step out to not be raped or murdered”, to which some dude replied, “men get killed on the streets too” and within several minutes her raked in over a 100 dvs. On another instance where some feminist showed a similar sentiment a man replied “men get killed on the streets as much as women” to which she replied “but that’s by other men”.

See that last quote above? they put me in the same basket as rapists and murderers. And then they want men to be able to be as emotionally open and talk freely about their issues as women, and what’s holding us back is apparently “Patriarchy”. If you look at the worst men, and what their idea of masculinity is, and then call it “toxic masculinity” you’re scum. It’s like looking at a rapist and howling “toxic man! toxic man!” but worse, since masculinity is a gendered term. It’s a coy way of being sexist, and that’s not considering the ways in which feminists use the word itself, which I described in my first paragraph, in addition to cases like boys doing bad at school, male depression and suicide, I could speak on these topics as well for a feminist will listen, not that anyone will read this. :)

And I should add that we need “feminism” stupid gender roles which keep women back and sexism is despicable, but this ted talk is not about that."
WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,fe040j0,t1_fe026ru,1578802526.0,"Yep, and you know what. I recently got banned from relationship advice for calling a woman a slut and a whore. 

Now, for context, the post was made by the guy, he said that his complaint to his partner that she’s not affectionate enough started an argument/fight which made her say in anger - and I think if I could quote the post from memory it’d be much better than any paraphrasing but that’s all I’ve got - something along the lines of “the other men I was with sexually satisfied me more”. So this slut shamed him for not stacking up to the the other men, I commented that she’s a whore and has no respect for you, this slut will probably cheat.  - Banned. 

The thing is, women sexually shame men like this, even in general let alone on a case by case basis. I have literally seen a woman on ask women say “yeah we trashtalk men for catharsis”.

Society is skewed and making men bend to this toxicity LOL"
WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,fe01n08,t1_fdvhn8r,1578800838.0,Isn’t that nice. Most women lie about it. If they’re honest we can steer clear and be with someone who doesn’t just fuck anyone
WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,fe01jnq,t1_fdxfjfn,1578800777.0,It will remain warped when you’re with her. She’ll probably cheat on you
marriagestrike,fdzzxj3,t1_fdzerdd,1578799759.0,"Seems like you have someone who doesn’t mind doing most of the work, good for you!

Also, don’t act like women and feminism doesn’t actively vilify men. Feminists, those in family courts, social workers, “support groups” etc do a lot to attack men."
marriagestrike,fdzrp9x,t1_fd7b0jq,1578794226.0,"What’s the point? I am new to this sub and what do men stand to gain by not wanting marriage, or in some cases it seems, by not wanting companionship altogether? Shouldn’t we try to change laws and stuff so that a man doesn’t stand to lose everything when the marriage goes bad rather than just quitting."
HistoryPorn,fdzq3lb,t1_fdzpyff,1578793208.0,Exactly my thoughts. Not that I can do that
HistoryPorn,fdzp7gt,t3_enf0yk,1578792729.0,Ohh man. Stuff like this makes me wish I was rich
