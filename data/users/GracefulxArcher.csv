politics,fgi43xq,t1_fgi3yqr,1580804601.0,"The program used to vote, by my understanding, was electronic, wasn't it?  Owned by a private company.  That has no prior experience in vote counting.

Or have I got it wrong?

If I'm right, wouldn't it be pretty simple to have a central server that tallies results as they come through?"
politics,fgi3om3,t1_fgi3fli,1580804031.0,"Wouldn't they have the information live, as caucuses conclude?

Being a private company, I have no doubt they could have been bought."
politics,fgi302v,t1_fgi2q0f,1580803142.0,"No, I specifically don't think it's a technical fuck up. I think results are being held until someone can think of a spin to make his win not count, or less impactful.

I specifically think that there are a group of people in power who (despite your objections) have the ability to directly control information and are doing so to minimise the chance of Bernie's victory.

That said, as I already admitted, I'm biased."
politics,fgi2crj,t1_fgi25uo,1580802334.0,"As a Brit, and therefore basically a neutral party, my prediction is that Bernie won so there's attempts to find some way of avoiding making it official.

I get how conspiratorial it sounds, but I've just got 100% faith that politics in general is *that* corrupt.

The reason I think it's Bernie they are trying to cover up is, granted, probably because of reddits bias.  We will see by tomorrow."
education,fgfbwkl,t3_ey0pp9,1580733826.0,"Make the blank walls a feature on day one: ""This is our classroom to decorate"".  Make the first week (partly) about decorating your room however the children want - they can make streamers or paintings.

It is a good opportunity for them to demonstrate craft skills, and you can begin dropping in the words for things in different languages.

You can then continue it by using the children's work to decorate the walls as you continue through the years.  Especially writing- kids love having their writing up, especially if it's because they did particularly well.

In terms of management, always give them a clear choice - you can write with us, or you can read a book, but then you will be writing while the others play.  This freedom of choice is particularly important for traumatised children, but they need to understand there are consequences.

If someone is aggressive towards you or other children, focus on the behaviour, and separate it from the child.  ""Hitting someone is unacceptable behaviour"" not ""You are not showing acceptable behaviour""."

awfuleverything,fg0k5dx,t1_fg0j174,1580409427.0,"Personally, I don't see going to prison as a punishment for the act itself, since all laws are subjective.

Prison is for people who knowingly, with intent, break laws.  Whatever the law is.  Otherwise, the law becomes hazy and you can just say ""this man doesn't deserve to go to jail because I don't think X y and z should be illegal""."

As for the others:

""While Pakistani speakers of English use idioms peculiar to their homeland (often literal translations of words and phrases from their native languages), this is far less common in proficient speakers, and grammar tends to be quite close to that of Standard English but exhibiting some features of American English.

Pakistani English phonology follows that of British English. It may be rhotic or non-rhotic. Rahman provides a broad introduction to the phonology of Pakistani English.""


And so on.

Americans often think that they are the centre of the universe, but it's us Brits who colonised every continent."

MakeMeSuffer,ffqv67a,t1_ffnt5hl,1580144366.0,Yeah. Let's start with you.
education,ffquvnq,t1_ffqrxhw,1580144176.0,"Firstly: He doesn't *want* to fail you.  It may seem that way, because you feel like he is making demands that you don't feel you can meet, but every failed student makes him look worse as a professional.  He wants you to succeed, if only to make himself look good (of course, normally there's more reason than that).

Secondly: it sounds from what you have said that you want a chance to move on to the next year, despite being behind on all your work.  If that were to happen, it is possible you could catch up and, by the time the end of the year comes, graduate normally...  But it's much more likely (statistically speaking, if you ignore the holistic knowledge this man has of you) that you will not pass, and will end up failing (and therefore looking bad).

Someone dropping out after their first year is much less impactful on school standings than failing in your second year - I can explain why if you're interested, but it's complicated.  It is in both of your best interests for you to leave school and do something more appropriate to your living arrangements.

If you are unwell, take time off and find a balance that allows you to keep a consistent schedule.  If you can never keep a consistent schedule, due to whatever reason, then mainstream school isn't for you and you should look into alternatives."
criticalrole,ffo3wpr,t1_ffo24xr,1580073858.0,Yeah...  It's a running joke from earlier in the campaign.

nextfuckinglevel,fflrywr,t1_fflpiou,1580043305.0,"Reddit admin team, cavallinorosa, and fenix_L"
MakeMeSuffer,fflqfs4,t1_fflpcbh,1580042756.0,"Yeah.  If someone is unsafe, they need to be seperated from society.  There's a difference between supporting people and letting them get away with anti social behaviour.  

Not all people who want to rape actually do so, because they understand societies rules.  Shit happens because the people who do it don't understand, or don't agree, with societies rules.  If it's the former, we need to help them and if it's the latter, we need to find out why and either fix it, or in extreme circumstances seperate the person.

""Do not kink shame"" applies to any situation where the kink is amongst consenting adults.  If you want to argue that we don't consent to seeing this woman wear a tail in public, the same could be said for hats...  If I don't want to see people wearing hats, they should be banned?

  If you cant see anything suggestive, I don't see the problem. People are just getting obnoxious in this thread because of their own personal views on the matter."

MakeMeSuffer,ffkqqri,t1_ffk70ke,1580027234.0,"By this argument, it's unfair to do anything that makes anyone uncomfortable, ever.  Theres nothing inherently wrong about being naked in public, just as there's nothing wrong with disliking the naked body being displayed in public.  Why do you get the authority to say that one uncomfortableness is more important than another?

I've always thought people have a weird obsession with not seeing anyone naked.  As if the human body is shocking and new, or knowing what someone looks like naked is forbidden knowledge.

Clothes aren't natural.  We are the only species ashamed of ourselves."
