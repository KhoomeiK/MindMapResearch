Exactly this. I use hemp/weed to both calm me down, alter my perception while doing *some* types of therapy work (cptsd). At the right dosage, it help really aid my CPT therapy, but too much and the fear floor it installs hinders some of the processing."

OpenChristian,ff3l4a6,t3_er6kkl,1579543357.0,"What sort of being Jesus is/was isn't easy to answer, esp as we don't have a systematic theology from God. (Thanks, God.)

1) There are bits in the NT where he is described as the firstborn among creation.  

2) There is the whole monotheism thing (If the Father is God and Jesus is God, but Jesus =\= the Father, then there are 2 things you are calling God).  

3) Then there's the whole theophany thing (where God shows up as an angel, or a bush, etc).  

4) Then there's the whole divine council thing in the OT, where YHWH evolves in Jewish thought (as recorded in the OT) from being a local chief, to the head chief of the gods, to the only god.'

5) Then there's the whole divine adoption thing. The baptism of Jesus can be contextually read as a // with Augustus being adopted by Julias.  Writers of the NT often drew such // with the overarching message of Jesus is God, not the Emperor.   This is bolstered by the fact that Greco-Roman culture was rife with divine adoptions. Humans are empowered by the gods to do amazing shit and because they are humans doing the work of the gods (they are breaking the natural order) there's the cost, which is often a brutal death.

6) Early Christians wrestled with the question.  You have the [Gospel of Peter](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelpeter.html), a hugely popular 2nd century text, taking the divine adoption view (or at least some form of [doceticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docetism), we only have the ending).  You also have the [Infancy Gospel of Thomas](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/infancythomas-a-roberts.html) which speculated on what a god-child would be like.

So, I can easily sympathize, though I disagree as a trinitarian, with people who have a hard time it. The opening of John kinda does it for me."

MMJ,feoiohw,t1_fenesus,1579300724.0,"The only proviso (and it is important, at least for me), is that when I'm doing my CPT worksheets, narratives, etc it works a little too well.  After my therapist suggested not using either while working on this stuff, I gave it a try.  She doesn't want me to use it at all, but knows I'm going to for good reasons.

I noticed that using either hemp or MMJ kept my emotional floor up high enough that that little connection between the PFC and the amygdala wasn't being rewired. Or rather, my PFC didn't need to calm my amygdala down during those times b/c the MMJ was already doing that.
