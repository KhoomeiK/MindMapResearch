writing,fdl63y4,t1_fdl1ywi,1578517683.0,"He gave us six months deadline because he wanted to stay as far away from the story as possible. And they only took less than two extra months to get back to him. They gave him their words (probably o should’ve added this bit in the OP). And that’s why I asked him to wait for the feedback. My friend told me he’d already edited it to death, and that he needed fresh eyes.

He trusted those beta readers. A little faith in them when they gave him their words could’ve probably made the difference."

Fantasy,fdazkwf,t3_ekd9yv,1578252077.0,Haha. Had the same feeling about graphic novels. I read Sandman first. Then I started looking into more graphic novels from around the world. I read the Korean Manhwa “Bastard” and was feeling emotionally drained for a few days afterwards. The twists and turns broke my back. It was a hell of a read. Now I’m reading the Japanese manga “Berserk.” It’s been great so far!
