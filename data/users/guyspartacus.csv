facepalm,ff5khvp,t3_errw37,1579597232.0,What’s wrong with that? Track pumps like that are capable of filling bicycle tires to 120+ PSI. Perfectly reasonable to get 30PSI in a car tire

So say you were getting a serving of Som Tam - they’d put it in a polystyrene dish, put that in a bag, then in another bag put a plastic spork thing and a napkin then put both those bags in a bigger bag"

Took it fairly seriously in my 20s and got some (relatively) decent numbers on the platform (220kg dead, 190kg squat, 150kg bench)

sarmssourcetalk,fdgfp8p,t1_fdgflon,1578394684.0,The bench definitely is - I think there’s more squat with the security of a spotter. OHP is a double and deadlift I don’t like to push too far because of a fragile lower back. But all fairly comfortable.
