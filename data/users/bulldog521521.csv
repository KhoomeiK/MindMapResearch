phenibut,ffjt0q7,t3_eu042h,1580006146.0,That's how it is for me. I've only taken moderate doses though. I'm sure it does enhance the actual quality if you take enough.

AskReddit,ffgwps6,t1_ffgp99j,1579917001.0,"Absolutely. Brené Brown has done great research on this. She interviewed hundreds of men from all over the place and I'm pretty sure every single man who didn't lead a wholehearted life (basically if they've succumbed to toxic masculinity as a lifestyle) said that anger was the only emotion that they ever fully expressed. Any other emotion registered as weakness to them. 

So yeah, it's definitely a thing. Society expects men to bottle up all of their emotions and be ""the strong one,"" all the time. If you don't push through and tough it out no matter what, you're a failure."

socialanxiety,fdrgn9l,t1_fdpvmum,1578684229.0,"The type of Ashwagandha actually does play a huge part. The particular type that was tested and shown to treat anxiety/depression is KSM-66 in particular. It's possible that the kind that you tried previously wasn't KSM-66, so it wouldn't have been as effective. 

I think therapy is a great option as well. It does highly depend on how good your particular therapist is though because some are definitely better or worse than others. It doesn't have much to do with credentials because they all require the same education (at least in the USA). Some people can get the certification, but just don't have the level of empathy or creative problem solving to help with complex issues like anxiety. Once you find a therapist that really clicks with you, it can make a huge difference. 

As far as antidepressants go, I don't really know much about them. They're very hit or miss, so some level of experimentation is usually required to find which one works for you. It's probably best that they're only used as a last resort since they have the largest trade-off of all the treatment options for anxiety. They could work great for you though. You'll never know until you try."
socialanxiety,fdpiscz,t1_fdoeszv,1578629754.0,"I've recently started taking [Ashwagandha](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inner-source/201401/ashwagandha-anxiety) and it's actually done wonders. It's only been a few days since I started taking it, but I already notice a huge drop in anxiety/depression levels and I just feel really good overall. It's fairly well researched and there are no recorded negative side effects. 

I would recommend looking into [adaptogens](https://nootropicsdepot.com/articles/ultimate-guide-to-nootropics-part-4-adaptogens/) in general. It's a class of herbs that have been shown to relax you when you're under high stress and also energize you when you're under normal circumstances. Ashwagandha is apart of that family. It's probably the most well-researched of them all and has the most diverse benefits, ranging from reduced anxiety/depression symptoms to increased libido and better focus. 

The particular type I use is the KSM-66 from [Nootropics Depot](https://nootropicsdepot.com/ksm-66-ashwagandha-extract-300mg-capsules/?gclid=CjwKCAiAu9vwBRAEEiwAzvjq-2vgKuwZtLwpQWhhRpPg7Skv_BIRh7yBdDRgPRfCFBpEjOqh1lHafhoCzxYQAvD_BwE). I've tried several nootropics from them and they're all very high quality. I'm also about to try rhodiola rosea and gotu kola, which are fairly similar to Ashwagandha but have a few different benefits. 

I can't remember where I read it, but there was a study that tested and compared certain adaptogens to prescription antidepressants, and the adaptogens showed strikingly similar reductions in anxiety/depression with no side effects. The side effects are by far the worst part of traditional antidepressants, so I would highly recommend trying ahwagandha, rhodiola rosea, and gotu kola before you try those since they have no risk associated with them (unless you're on medication to reduce blood pressure because the combined effect could drop it more than needed)."
socialanxiety,fdos8vz,t1_fdnryc5,1578611730.0,"I agree. I like it when people make me feel like I'm allowed to be an anxious wreck and they won't judge me. A big part of my anxiety is having to pretend like I'm not anxious and put on a show, which makes me way more anxious."
socialanxiety,fdnvihh,t1_fdnp8jg,1578593690.0,"Exactly. A lot of people confuse nervousness with anxiety. *Nervousness* is totally normal and everyone probably feels it on a regular basis. It's not the funnest thing to feel, but it's not unhealthy in any way. The key difference with anxiety is that it triggers your fight-or-flight response, which is extremely unhealthy. 

Fight or flight is something that's built into almost every animal's brain by default as a means of protection against danger. It's only supposed to kick in when you're genuinely in a situation where your safety or your life are threatened and you need to either fight or run away as quickly as possible (flight) in order to survive. That's when anxiety disorders come into the picture. 

I'm not an expert on it, but what happens is that this response floods you with adrenaline and sends your amygdala (the part of your brain responsible for feelings of fear) into overdrive so that you have the physical and mental resources to save yourself. That's all fine and dandy when your life is actually at stake, but it's completely immobilizing and does you no good if it happens in a situation where you need to be calm. 

When you have an anxiety disorder, you perceive normal everyday situations as genuine, life-threatening danger (not by choice, obviously). They've sorted it into separate disorders based on the triggers, like social phobia, generalized anxiety, agoraphobia etc. But ultimately, the root cause of all of them is having a fight-or-flight response to something that does not realistically call for that. 

That's the thing that neurotypical people don't understand. We literally feel like we are going to die when faced with certain everyday situations. We have no control over it in the conscious mind; your subconscious decides when it happens. That's why we can't simply ""breathe and have positive thoughts"" to make it go away. The only way to get rid of it is to completely rebuild your subconscious mind to stop perceiving these things as danger, which is extremely difficult to do and no one really knows for sure how to do it yet. 

Anyway, this is more for anyone who reads this that doesn't understand anxiety than for you specifically lol"
socialanxiety,fdly8z2,t1_fdjppgi,1578535358.0,I laugh at so many things that I shouldn't out of sheer anxiety. It ends up with a lot of people thinking that I'm either deranged or an asshole.
socialanxiety,fdlxyug,t3_elr8ce,1578535165.0,"In grade school, I would just say *yes* or *no* at random when I didn't hear a question in hopes that it was the right answer. It almost never was. I got a lot of people saying that *that literally makes no sense* and I would just laugh like an idiot and then confirm that it indeed makes no sense. It usually ended with the person giving me a very confused but also concerned expression and then slowly turning away and we pretended like it never happened.

So yeah, I didn't handle my anxiety very well lol. Ugh, school was the worst."
phenibut,fdj0wre,t1_fdh1djg,1578455623.0,"It fucks my stomach up sooo bad, ugh. I guess it's kind of a good thing because it motivates me to only take it when I *really* need it. It works out though because while I'm on it, I'm far less scared to use a public restroom."

Anxiety,fcugj4v,t3_eit1wh,1577980422.0,"My anxiety *has* been the downfall of pretty much all of my relationships (platonic at least). I have a boyfriend now though and while I don't think it will be the ""downfall"" of our relationship, it definitely causes a lot of issues. He's a major extrovert that has absolutely no social anxiety and by nature he loves big social events and get-togethers, while I'm not only a major introvert but also extremely socially anxious. I honestly think I have agoraphobia more than social phobia. 

But yeah, it kinda sucks for both of us sometimes because I'm always wishing that I could enjoy myself in social situations, and he's always wishing the same thing lol. I also have panic attacks all the time and it causes us to fight sometimes because they keep me from being able to do basic things that he has no problem doing. So maybe not the downfall, but definitely the biggest point of contention."

AskReddit,fcj48v4,t1_fcgsuqx,1577676884.0,"It also has a lot to do with the THC to CBD ratio. CBD lessens the psychoactive effect of THC and is calming, so if you're prone to anxiety, higher CBD strains are definitely the better option."
AskReddit,fcj2fu8,t1_fcgq1as,1577675605.0,"I definitely notice this. I've been smoking daily for almost a year and I pretty much don't dream anymore. I honestly like it though because I've always had issues with night terrors and I'm finding that my sleep is far less interrupted now that they're gone. My dreams have always been very vivid and were rarely about anything good. Some of the scariest things I've ever experienced have been nightmares.

Needless to say, I do not miss dreaming at all."
AskReddit,fcj0skf,t1_fci2gqp,1577674445.0,"I'm just now realizing that this is how I did it too. Idk if I would've made it through my last bout of suicidal depression without weed. My depression was so overwhelming, I couldn't think about anything else at all. Weed allowed me to forget about it for a little bit and let my brain just wander aimlessly. 

Thankfully, after a dose of psilocybin and Brené Brown's books, depression is far less of an issue for me now. Weed is honestly insanely better now that depression isn't in the driver's seat. It's so much more euphoric and energizing than it ever was when I was depressed."
AskReddit,fcj00nj,t1_fci8y8l,1577673904.0,"Being high feels very different depending on how depressed I am. When I'm going through a really bad bout, weed only makes me forget about my pain and doesn't really feel good. But when I'm doing good, the high is euphoric and super fun. It's quite interesting. But my motivation levels are definitely more linked to my depression than how much weed I smoke."
AskReddit,fciljbz,t1_fci7zjd,1577664583.0,"I'm so the opposite lol. I get so chatty and more emotionally open when I'm high.

phenibut,fc9nbv5,t1_fc9int4,1577555273.0,"I'm not an expert or anything, but I don't see how taking it three times a day almost every day would even work. Phenibut builds tolerance very quickly. I don't feel anything at all even just taking it two days in a row. 

To consistently reap the most benefits from it without building tolerance, I would recommend as little as once a week. Even then I would also recommend taking a couple weeks off every now and then to prevent habit forming, which can also lead to addiction. 

All signs point to Phenibut being just as addictive as benzos, so I would treat it with the same care as them. The main difference is that Phenibut really only works recreationally because it takes much longer to kick in than benzos (takes about two hours to peak, but lasts anywhere from 3-8 hours in my experience). I only take it to go to big social events, which I do very rarely because I'm a socially anxious introvert."
