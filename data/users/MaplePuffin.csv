Not allowed to show emotion or talk about mental health is deemed 'unmanly' really takes a toll on ones body and soul and whenever I hear about how men have tried to open up emotionally and talk about their feelings only to be shot down it breaks my heart. You're human just like us women and should be allowed to talk and share their feelings without being ridiculed. Sadly, toxic masculinity is prevalent in today's society, even way back in the old days. I know I can't press a button and make these issues all better but I can offer a kind voice if you ever need to vent about your feelings or just talk about your day, no matter how bad or good it was.

The disabled and mentally ill can only do so much and while I agree we should help those with a mental illness so they can have a better future, many still cast them to the side.

For example, my Mum worked in a hotel but events happened which caused her to develop PTSD and severe anxiety and depression and she had to quit her job. We live off money from the Canadian government and AISH which gives a bit of financial support for those who can't work.
