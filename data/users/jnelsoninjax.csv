I really love it when karma comes back and bitch slaps Karen so hard that she can't even speak! The problem seems to be that more and more of these 'Karen's' are showing up and  rearing their ugly little heads, one might wonder if they are the product of /r/entitledkids"

I love those entitled asshole drivers ,who drive big cars because they are lacking size in another certain area, get revenged on.  About 2 years ago my sister and myself were riding our bicycles home from work (around 0:00) so the streets were deserted and we were riding side by side, and would move over as soon as a vehicle approached. Well one asshole in a truck zoomed up and was riding our tale, swerves into the other lane and yells at us to GTFO the street. Not even 2 minutes later we come up to a red light, and who happens to be there? The asshole! I of course laughed at him (his window was down) and said, you were so impatient and could not wait to get past us, now look, you are stuck at the same light we are! Then as soon as the traffic was clear, I shot threw the intersection, laughing at him the entire time! My sister realized what was happening and followed suit!"
