offmychest,fe6g11e,t1_fe6fp36,1578889784.0,Yeah they won't with me either. But due to being on blood thinners because of this I don't see the point really. It's probably for the best when you reacted as hard as you did. I think they suggested surgery in my case but im not sure.

I'd also be careful depending on what type of birth control you're getting because I got the worst side effect you can get from them and im paying for that now and will for ages.

offmychest,fduwyo2,t3_en5jli,1578740266.0,"I just want to say that there's such a big difference between therapy not working and a specific therapist not doing their job. Same with medication. I went through over 15 different psychologists and about 22 different types of medication before I found a combo that worked for me and made a difference. A lot of people also insist that therapy doesn't work because they tried it, listened to everything that was said, but didn't actually work on it themselves. Therapy is a two way model and a therapist can't always help by just telling someone what's wrong. 

Price wise I completely understand that not everyone can afford it. I wouldn't have been able to if it had cost me anything where I live, but it's a part of free health care for me.

Telling someone to ""get help"" alone isn't right, in my opinion, because I know how difficult that can be. But ive also experienced that so many either haven't thought of it, or feel like their issues doesn't warrant therapy because 'others have it worse'. There's nothing wrong in suggesting it when people ask for advice, but it's important to remember that a type of medication or a specific therapist doesn't necessarily work on the first try. My first types of medications made me a walking zombie. I was less depressed, but I also stopped caring about anything happening around me. 

But then again, it doesn't work for absolutely everyone with the 'try something different' model. Therapy can be a lot of different things. In my case it was Cipralex and volunteering in an animal shelter."
