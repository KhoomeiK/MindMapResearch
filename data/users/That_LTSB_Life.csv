gaming,ffe0slr,t1_ffdl7z9,1579833750.0,"I'll have to point out that when [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/cn36ab/more_transformation_shit/) was posted to Reddit, he proved even more popular... I can't comment on this being due to him being attractive as this brave new world of Social Media turning out to be a way of glamorising mean-spirited, low-effort 'contributions' not unlike yours actually provoked me several years ago to pursue extreme means of supressing all my hormones so as to be able to escape the sort of inate emotionally and psychologically unpleasant responses that behaviouralists believe leaves non-dullards facing the choice of being experience regular bouts of unhappiness and depression, or unwillingly undergoing reformations of their otherwise perfectly adequate personalities in order for them to become the kind of person who tacitly approved of the 'intellectual validity' and 'apositeness' of this new wave of ne-plus-duller and inescapably regressive social behaviour."

gadgets,fet8iyt,t1_feshb7a,1579372760.0,"RDNA at 2ghz isn't happening - certainly not on an APU with a restricted TDP. 

The best, largest custom color designs with dedicated power subsystems the RX5700xt get around 1900ghz. APUs are big but filled with all sorts of other blocks... all that heat has to go somewhere, all that power has to come from somewhere. A 2Ghz RDNA 8 Zen core PC will use as much as 300w. I don't see how that is doable with a PS4 style package.  


My guess is that the dev kit GPUs feature something  along the lines of a modified GCN  with a throughput of \~10FTflops (Circa Vega 64 type performance). This will translate to a 44-56 core RDNA GPU in the APU found in the product that reaches consumers : More compute cores than the 5700xt, but clocked lower due to practical design limitations. On the plus side, eschewing the DGPU paradigm of maximum clocks for maximum available performance allows the designers to deliver a product where the silicon works closer to peak efficiency."
aww,feoghoz,t3_eq0rbm,1579299840.0,Labralove = best love (usually a bit smelly and hot tho)

Subscription with free tasters (or at the very least, much, much wider device support) must come so very soon, or it's going to look like they are quietly OK with it failing."

Games,fcnxuor,t1_fcn1dte,1577820559.0,"It appears the aim is to find reviews that you agree with. You're a bit rich in using the term critique, as exposure to criticism is fundamentally meant to expose the flaws and limitations in our understanding of things. To shield yourself from views because you decided you probably don't agree with the critic is to defeat the purpose of criticism. 

It's the kind of behaviour that has people wondering where the hell popular philosophy went wrong. All people like you have learned is to use the sort of phrases used in intellectual discourse to justify your existing choices, and it's awfully glaring and disheartening when they are wheeled out to justify your choice to remain ignorant.

It's pretty bad stuff, I really die a little on the inside when I am reminded how prevelant this trend to corrupt and devalue concepts and terms fundamental to intellectual progress in western civilisation is.

The frustration with criticism was always that of being able to lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. These days it feels like the horse is likely to turn round and tell you it has no need for water, having had a drink at the most a couple of days ago, and then turn to another horse and make a joke about humans living in echo chambers where they mutually reinforce the stereotypically pre-post-colonialist view that horses share their need to drink water or die.

Will you not just take a fucking drink?"
Games,fcnw41a,t1_fcmsgdd,1577819614.0,Shaping your media consumption because you don't want to hear different views is a great recipe for staying dumb. Doing it on the basis of you not liking one single VG? Wow.
movies,fch1zfv,t3_eh71gy,1577646506.0,"LOL, way to prove people really like hating Ad Astra. I think it might be a James Gray thing.

Anyway, in the spirit of Circlejerk and bullying...

'I was physically sick upon reading you gave this NOT A SCI FI film one point more than the objectively better, cultural event of the year, 'Ultra Marvel Sequel The Second!!"" Everyone I know in real life messaged me to say the same thing; you should obviously be ashamed and never ever think you know ANYTHING about movies or anything I hope you never sleep again.

But srsly, a great list and that always means disagreeing on something. Picked out a couple already that I'd overlooked. How to repay the man who has seen everything? I was going to recommend Birds Of Paradise but I guess that's 2018. If you've missed it, you might like Episode 6 of the Watchmen Series. It's one of the best examples of good direction and editing I've seen in quite some time."
AskReddit,fbyjjrl,t1_fbyabsk,1577218508.0,"Not really that funny. People were told how to use the site for the best - downvote is not to be used simply because you disagree - but the vast majority decided not to, and they're now busy misleading each other.

The amount of corrosively cynicical attitudes and desperately unappy world-views I've come accross has really increased over time. I worry people mistake hearing what they like for what it true, and it removes the possibility that there are things they need to hear that they don't want to, and they can expect that they might hear them any or every day, and it could be from any source. Instead, there is a worrying tendancy that some people expect that the streams of information they intake should respond to their preferences.

It took me some time to sort out that I had at some point lost my core interpersonal value, that I started to be concerned mostly with trying to win arguments and defend my positions, rather than remembering that no position or view is worth sacrificing the fundamental need to be FAIR to people. And you can't always be fair to everyone, hence the need to know when to look away and genuinely disregard views and behaviour... which is what I was always told, don't reward unsociable attitudes and behaviour with attention - the idea is to ignore it. It's something many of us were taught as youngsters, it was revised for the internet (do not feed the 'trolls'), and it's more important than ever now.

Don't get involved - the unhapiness and confusion will only spread to you, and you will lose the ability to think and react creatively and constructively to the problems, questions, contradictions of the world, and the needs of the people in it.

(I'm only really saying this to remind myself!)"
