Metroid,ff8wahw,t3_es3iot,1579698208.0,Just played AM2R myself and I have to say I thought it was amazing.  More enjoyable than fusion for sure.  I still like SM and Zero Mission better.  But AM2R is easily right behind them.
Metroid,ff8w2v5,t3_es5rrb,1579698017.0,"This isn't helpful to your question at all, but play AM2R.  It's a much more honest remake.  It's also incredibly fun.  In most Metroid games there's a bit of learning curve in getting a feel for Samus.  Not really the case in AM2R.  Samus just feels comfy in that game."

People with cleft palettes probably deal with that insecurity every fucking day of their lives.  If you're going to broach a subject like that, you do it sensitively and carefully.  This haphazard bullshit is ignorant.  So I'd have to probably agree with you that she meant no harm, but unfortunately that's not always good enough.  Do better."
