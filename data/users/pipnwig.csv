mildlyinfuriating,fe5z5k1,t1_fe5ocii,1578878185.0,Actually r/trashy tends to go the literal direction pretty often. Trash is pretty trashy. Especially people who trash our planet. They're the trashiest.
oddlysatisfying,fdvgm6a,t1_fduuis5,1578747176.0,Front tumbling is actually harder for women because our center of balance is in our hips. That means this one (a front walkover) is generally harder than the original (a back walkover). Obviously ymmv.
SkincareAddiction,fdria0y,t1_fdr7zug,1578684919.0,Yeah I honestly find it easier to handle than the safety. It's good for long stretches of skin and it doesn't get clogged if you let your leg hair grow out (which I doooooo). I find myself accidentally scooping the skin out of my shin with the safety razor but I've never cut myself with my straight and I've had it for about 5 years now :)
SkincareAddiction,fdovxvv,t1_fdo66a8,1578614105.0,"Also in that camp. Now I use a straight razor. The farther I got from multi-blade razors, the happier my skin was :) Still use my safety for my pits and it's the best."

bi_irl,fdle93t,t1_fdkv60m,1578522149.0,"Yeah I suppose it's more this statement I take issue with:

>A literalÂ dictionary definitionÂ ofÂ bisexuality, due to the prefixÂ bi-, is sexual or romantic attraction to twoÂ sexesÂ (malesÂ andÂ females), or to twoÂ gendersÂ (menÂ andÂ women).[8][9][15]Â Pansexuality, however, composed with the prefixÂ pan-, is the sexual attraction to a person of any sex or gender.Â "
bi_irl,fdks5j1,t1_fdkmaah,1578510027.0,"It also says:

>Because pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictlyÂ menÂ orÂ women, and pansexuality therefore rejects theÂ gender binary,[3][7]Â it is often considered a more inclusive term thanÂ bisexual.

Which is why I said what I did and why I said the ""accepted"" definition bothers me and I prefer to reject it."

Merrick sells ""corporal kneecaps"" on Amazon in a box of 50 and that was something we always kept stocked around the house.

oddlysatisfying,fcx3vwk,t1_fcwxyvt,1578050093.0,"It is very cool but as a homeowner I'd never buy a house with a room constructed like this because it would mean I couldn't use the room in a way I needed to use it without paying out the ass to have this dismantled. You'd be surprised how old and stodgy you get when you're making a purchase that's that expensive. You want to be able to use every inch of the space you paid for in whatever way you need it most... Not how someone else envisioned it. 

My assumption is that this is a family home that the guy has just decided the family will likely grow up and die in. When you have that many kids, you're probably ready to stop moving, maybe forever."
