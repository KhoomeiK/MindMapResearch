houston,ffdbdli,t3_esysl7,1579817235.0,Please ignore the people saying not to bother.  Talk to a lawyer.  There's literally no harm in just talking to someone about the specifics of your problem.  At the very least they can point you towards administrative remedies that might be cheaper than litigation like a report to the attorney general's office.
AskEngineers,ff9p1xb,t1_ff8743g,1579717701.0,"That's interesting because it looks like l near term the EIA is only reporting normalized cost parity in the next 5 years or so.  


I also wonder what the market outlook is going to be when all the non-dispatchable generation market share is consumed by renewables.  I don't really see where the baseload generation is going to come from.  

Don't get me wrong, I think we're going to transition to mostly renewables eventually we only disagree on the timing.  I think it'll take a major coalition of countries agreeing on a carbon taxing framework to make renewables economics finally work economically.  Until then you're going to be dependent on consumers who can afford to do so specifically asking for renewable energy and paying a higher price for it.  Or something similar.  And you need a clean energy solution for the developing world."
AskEngineers,ff7a8k9,t3_erv11k,1579644441.0,"Don't get me wrong, renewables are where we're heading as a society but they're not really they're yet as an industry.  

These projects and industries exist but there's a pretty big question about how viable they are when renewable isn't a focus by the government.  So in the US this translates to a market where your livelihood is essentially decided by whether federal incentives exist or not.  

Raise that by going into this sector you're going to significantly limit your ability to progress during your career.  Both economically and professionally.  It's your call and there are good reasons for focusing on this particular area but just be cognizant that renewables are gaining marketshare but they remain very unstable and significantly less profitable than fossil fuels."

Pathfinder_RPG,fe9qjoe,t1_fe9i6am,1578940585.0,Fair to say. I guess I just get frustrated when people try to make Pathfinder work for something it wasn't meant to when there's hundreds of other games out there with a few that okay do exactly what you want them to do.  Good luck.
Pathfinder_RPG,fe986f5,t3_eo1p6v,1578935233.0,"Everytime you think to yourself, I want to solve a problem in Pathfinder by completely changing a core mechanic you should ask yourself why you're not have finding a different rule system.  

What you're proposing would be much better done in a rule system that is designed with firearms in mind, not trying to hack Pathfinder to do what you want.

The benefit of Pathfinder is that it's relatively balanced, or at least it's unbalanced in known ways.  When you retool a mechanic like this it's absolutely going to be imbalanced in unintuitive ways because of the depth of the Pathfinder system."

AskEngineers,fe6ouvu,t3_envyg2,1578898621.0,"Do not go to a university that is not accredited.  How do you know that the University will actually get their accreditation? The answer is that you don't.

It's in the universities best interest to tell people they're seeking accreditation, but there's all sorts of things that could cause them to not get it.  Then you'll have enrolled and paid tuition and moved etc.  

You only effectively have one option here.

Edit: realize that accreditation is not like a spectrum.  Where schools with accreditation are better and there's a range of somewhat worse schools that either don't have accreditation or are in the process of getting it.  It's a binary.  If a school is unaccredited, you will not get an engineering degree.  Certification boards and most employers will see this as you effectively having no degree at all."
Foodforthought,fdpt92f,t1_fdpjzyq,1578639578.0,"Good question.

My first psych was a university medical center doctor and the University system takes upwards of three months to process records requests.  My second doctor was part of a large psychiatric hospital that went bankrupt and nobody returns calls anymore.  My third doctor died and there were no continuity plans.  

I did get the University records to my second doctor eventually but he said that he'd still rather see how CBT worked for me now as they were being discouraged from prescribing stimulants."
Foodforthought,fdorzr0,t3_emc55o,1578611572.0,"Because many doctors are assholes.  

I have ADHD.  I've been in the same meds for the past 10 years with only small changes in dosage here or there as I've lost and gained weight.  

Everytime I move I get the wonderful opportunity to engage with the raging dumpster fire that is our mental healthcare system.  So first you have to find a list of places that accept your flavor of insurance, then you have to double check them to see if they actually take your insurance.  The first step might yield 100 providers if you're willing to drive a ways.  The second step will reduce that list to 10-20 providers.

Then you have to go to their website and see if those providers are part of a practice that doesn't believe in prescribing stimulants (that's me specifically but there's any number of supposedly legitimate mental healthcare providers that tie some weird ideology to their treatment that you have to accept to get care).  This will usually drop you down to 5-10 providers.  

That's the easy work done.  Now you have to see if any of them are accepting new patients.  If they are does the provider specialize in a demographic that you're not a part of?  Good luck with that.

Then you get to actually go to an appointment.  You get to explain your medical history 2-3 times in addition to filling out a form on the website and a paper form in the office.  Then you have to graciously accept that the doctor would like you to try some form of CBT and life coach training before they'll prescribe the medication that you've been taking without issue for a decade.  

Then when that doesn't work, which you knew it wouldn't because you've been forced to try whatever non medical intervention of the day several times over the years, you get to try any number of other medications because they're ""not as addictive"".  You know why they're not as addictive? Because they don't work as well.  

Then finally they'll give you the prescription and now you get the wonderful opportunity to interact with a pharmacist.  You'll get to convince the pharmacist that the script is real.  They'll want to call your doctor to verify and if your doctor isn't available sorry you'll have to wait until they hear back from the doc.  

Etc etc etc.  

And this is for a thing that I know I have.  That I know the effective treatment for. And that's been well handled for a decade.  I can't imagine what it's like trying to navigate this system with an active mental health problem that you haven't had diagnosed and which might not have a good treatment."

For reference the pH scale is a log scale so small differences are actually really big.

Pathfinder_RPG,fde5rtg,t1_fde4j3e,1578331791.0,"Oh absolutely.  A dragon would never put itself in a position to where it would need to fly but it's one of those things that I'd imagine they'd learn over the many years it takes for a dragon to get to that size, always have an exit strategy.  

But the other thing is most people expect a dragon to fly if you're going to fight it.  So many GM's end up bungling this part because the fly rules are pretty fiddly and easy to overlook.  I'd honestly be fine with just giving the dragon a special ability that lets it ignore fly checks entirely or just gives them a blanket +20 modifier."
Pathfinder_RPG,fde4o40,t1_fde45kk,1578331099.0,"That's a good question.  You only really need to be able to reliably hit a 15 or 20.  I'd think you'd take the hit on something like sense motive, bluff, or intimidate?"
Pathfinder_RPG,fde3dtj,t3_ekvkit,1578330285.0,"I'm always amused when dragons don't put points into fly.  

I guess they gave him the hover feat but this guy is going to fall out of the sky anytime he does anything but hover or fly horizontally.  

I can guarantee that in a fight where the dragon is going to use that flyby attack feat he'll need to do something that will require a fly check.  It's always a little awe-ruining for the colossal epic BBEG dragon to trip over his own feet.  

You'd think dragons would be smarter than that."

todayilearned,fddoiqf,t1_fdd71x2,1578319604.0,Dogs get Salmonella and ecoli just as readily as humans do.  They just end up being asymptomatic mostly.  Although I'd love to see some academic proof that they're somehow bacterially resistant.

todayilearned,fdd2jz3,t1_fdd0qnb,1578292216.0,"Humans are garbage disposals.  Our ability to eat most anything without consequence is actually pretty rare in nature.

Anything a dog can eat a human can eat also.

Edit: Jesus Christ Reddit calm the fuck down.  That said, dogs absolutely get Salmonella from eating raw chicken it just presents different in them.  Some dogs get diahrea whereas some humans die.  But sum total there's a huge proportion of things that humans ""can"" eat that would absolutely kill dogs.  

Also just because you wouldn't eat garbage doesn't mean that people can't eat garbage.  There's a huge homeless population that will tell you that most dumpster food is just fine to eat (given a lack of other options).  When I say that humans can eat something I'm not saying that we would want to, just that we have an enormous capacity to eat things that are literally poison.  

Also, stop letting your dogs eat garbage.  Later taters."

LifeProTips,fclt3c7,t3_ehnjae,1577755801.0,"Here's another LPT.  Refuse to pay.  

Not if you have assets more than a house and a car then this isn't for you.  But if you have a financed car and are renting then this is fine for you.

Also, there's a narrow band where it is better to maybe pay or work out a payment plan or something.  So say more than $2k but less than say $50k.  

But if you're less than $2k or greater than $50k then see what kind of deal they offer when you tell them you're just not going to pay.  Then maybe consider just doing that.  

There are some caveats, if you're on the high side you're going to get sued.  But if that occurs you declare bankruptcy and move on.  If you're on the low side the debt will go to collections and for debts less than a few thousand dollars most places won't bother suing you.  

Now you have to accept that your credit score is going to be crap for awhile.  But the debt will eventually fall off your record.  And if you're in the >100k in debt category then your credit was going to be screwed anyway."
