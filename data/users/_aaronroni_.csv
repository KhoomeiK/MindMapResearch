I suppose I did make some assumptions but the vagueness and matter-of-fact tone make it feel like something personal to you that was drawn from your experience. I said bad and now vague because you only barely and one sidedly described what ""man cold"" is and didn't really answer the question in regards to it's being a meme and it's relevance. If the question was ""what is a ""man cold""?"", you'd have an answer, still one-sided, but an answer nonetheless. As it stands, you don't really answer the question.

In fact, alcohol thins your blood and makes you much more susceptible to hypothermia, even though you may feel warmer. It also reduces how much you shiver, exacerbating the problem. Alcohol and cold is a dangerous and life threatening combination and it is a common misconception that alcohol keeps you warmer. Please, if you drink alcohol and get out in the cold, keep this in mind. Just Google alcohol hypothermia if you want sources, it is well documented.
