SuicideWatch,fcyppuy,t3_ejkctr,1578084570.0,"I know it sounds generic, but it really does matter to people around you, you accomplish so much more when you show the world that it won’t beat you. Fuck the world and it’s problems you’re strong than that. Even if you have to work so hard to get there you’ll show yourself that you can do this."
SuicideWatch,fcypdly,t3_ejg4uv,1578084384.0,"I understand this, I really don’t know exactly why, but I prefer it when it’s just cloudy or rainy or something. It’s almost like I’m mad at the world for being happy when I’m not, I really don’t know."
WhatDoISayNow,fcvwg91,t1_fcvdii9,1578011649.0,"Thanks, i definitely want to have a little more evidence before actually accusing him of anything, but if it is true I won’t let him hurt my mom like that, that’s such a fucked up thing to do"
WhatDoISayNow,fcvbdpg,t1_fculj7n,1577998555.0,"I also hope that I am wrong about my suspicions, I really love my parents but I couldn’t forgive my dad if he did that, I probably wouldn’t tell my mom unless I had solid solid evidence."
WhatDoISayNow,fcvb8pe,t1_fctykzg,1577998473.0,"If it weren’t for the current suspicions, I absolutely love my dad, and I’d to see the relationship get fucked up, but if it’s true than I agree, fuck him. My mom is the last person in the world that deserves that treatment."
WhatDoISayNow,fctqakq,t1_fcticok,1577953993.0,"I mean I get that, but I’ve never seen anything bad in their relationship, they have little bickers but never like full arguing, my dad is always a little stuck up but I really doubt something is wrong with the marriage, but I don’t know I’ve never dealt with anything like this, I don’t want to jump to conclusions it’s just really weird and kind of adds up in my head"
WhatDoISayNow,fctq756,t1_fct59xk,1577953861.0,"I understand, I really don’t want to accuse my dad of something he isn’t doing, but I’d also hate myself if my mom never knew, I won’t jump to conclusions, I’ll figure out what’s actually going on, it’s just all so suspicious with the texting, and being gone so much, it’s not really like him to say those types of things to anyone but friends, and I find the “god” in “god, I love you” a little weird, I want to find out what’s really going on so that I can relax about all this"
WhatDoISayNow,fctq2kf,t1_fct91f6,1577953683.0,"Thanks for the response, and thank you for understanding, I’ve never negatively thought of my dad, I’ve always really looked up to him, the thought of this literally sickens me, I can’t sleep and I haven’t been happy for a while because this thought is haunting me."
SuicideWatch,fct3pcy,t3_eiqazb,1577932070.0,"I feel so much for you, 2019 was terrible, but it feels amazing to say “we’re still here.” We made it, and we CAN keep going!"

depression_help,f94t7bp,t1_f94rikr,1575102197.0,"I’ve been trying hard to do things I like, and when I’m doing them I’m happy. But the second I’m not doing things my mind starts thinking and I can’t sleep, I can’t be happy, I can’t get my mind off of it."
