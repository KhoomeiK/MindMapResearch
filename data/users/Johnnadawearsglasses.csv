NewGreentexts,fffoebt,t1_ffffyks,1579888301.0,"So the literal answer is no and no

The real answer is that JohnNadaWearsGlasses was initially an homage to the main character in the cult classic movie They Live, which is about a working man who discovers the truth.  John Nada literally means John Nothing and is meant to indicate that John is Everyman.  The truth he discovers is who controls the world and he does so by putting on special glasses 

When I thought about my username, it appealed to me in a lot of ways
- I was raised a working man
- I am a firm believer in the power of the truth
- And I think most ailments in the world result from people failing to see the broader truth about themselves and the world

So while They Live was the launching point for my name, the real meaning of the name is Every Man (JohnNada) Should Know the Truth (Wear Glasses). And my purpose for coming to Reddit was to learn more of the truth and help others see the truth.  So my first endeavors here were on advice sites.  Only serendipitously did i come across greentexts.  But as I read them and read the comments about them, I realized they are an interesting vehicle to allow people (Anons and Commenters) to learn and reveal greater truths about themselves, the human condition and the world at large.  Because we are often most honest when we are trying to be funny and / or when we are Anonymous.

This was probably a longer answer than you wanted.

PS - I used to wear glasses but i weaned myself off of them"

NewGreentexts,fff3sbl,t1_fff2wnm,1579874935.0,"I find the whole concept of publicly disclosed karma to be antithetical to the idea of an anonymous ""social media"" platform. To give one user more ""clout"" than another is the exact opposite of what it should be. Karma should be private and only used in a thread to sort the order of the comments using only upvotes from that thread. 

Putting all that aside I find my own karma to be uncomfortable. I never know when someone is responding in a certain way because they agree or like what I said or because they know who I am. I would like to think it's the former and that most people don't even click on the profiles and know the karma. 

Sometimes people ask (given the above) why I don't delete my account. The main answer is that I have many people here that I interact with on a regular basis. The secondary answer is that over time I've found people's reactions to my karma to be an interesting sociology study and so now I find it amusing."

AdviceAnimals,ffey566,t1_ffexjsq,1579870084.0,"We live in a world where intellectual capital and access to financial capital create wealth. And then you compound that wealth through the help of your employees, whose value you leverage into even greater value for yourself. That is how any actual sustainable business works. Otherwise, you are just a worker who happens to work for your customers as opposed to an internal boss. I have no idea what sort of work you do, but until you divorce the idea of ""how many hours am I working"" from ""how much value will I receive"" you will be a lifelong employee of others.

Ps - I enjoy the certainty of redditors on things they have no factual basis for and insufficient information relative to the person they are arguing with. It's comical and reinforces the idea that it's actually quite easy to make money in this world if you have your head on properly. The competition is thin."
