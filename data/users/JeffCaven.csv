Did you watch the entire S1? I also almost gave up after the first half, because despite the occasional interesting moment, such as Aang discovering the bodies of his entire tribe, most episodes were childish and uninteresting. Towards the end of the season characters finally start developing and the Siege of the North is a great arc.

S2 and S3 are definitely much better. There still is occasional childish humor, but a few more mainstay characters are introduced, the first episodes of S2 essentially start one of the best character arcs of all time IMO, and the worldbuilding is amazing to see. Give it a chance."

Regarding production: I think that pluck and 808 could be quite louder. It all sounds so background. Maybe it's the 808 itself, but I think a short but slightly louder one could do better. But great beat overall!

Which doesn't seem like reality to me.

He's not even that good as a pop artist."

DestinyTheGame,fc8j73m,t1_fc8gca9,1577536058.0,"It really isn't. I'll compare Destiny's pass to Apex's pass:


In Apex Legends, I bought a pass in which the mechanics for levelling up were MUCH easier (different kind of challenges give different progressions towards the season pass, from exp to progress a level to a whole entire level). The challenges, while they do limit your playstyle as long as you're trying to do them, usually give 2-3 different paths to completing them, and since challenges don't expire weekly, you'll eventually complete them at some point of the season. It took me about 8-10 hours every week to level up 10 levels, by playing 1 or 2 hours a day, and if I kept playing I could squeeze in a few extra ones. I felt like I had time for other games. The season is long enough that I don't feel too time pressured into completing it as fast as possible. In fact, the pass on Apex is pretty much designed to ""unlock"" a set of challenges every week, limiting how many levels someone can get every new week, but these challenges don't expire, so you can easily catch up if you miss a week. Even so, it does reward playing often and weekly by offering extra levels for completing limited dailies and generally, playing more games. And on top of that, I get 1000 premium currency to buy the next season's pass.

Meanwhile, in Destiny, I'll get 5 free levels a week with the weeklies and 2x bonus, and after that, getting the levels is a DRAG. I have to spend tons of time a week, a lot more than the 8-10 hours I spent in Apex, to hit 10 levels a week, and due to the short seasons, I feel pressured into playing as much as possible to make sure I complete the pass. The bounties are more restrictive, I have to constantly load in and out of the tower to get them, and they give less progression towards levelling (1/20) than Apex challenges do. I pretty much have to be playing Destiny exclusively, just by playing limited bounties, with no way to catch up if I miss them, to reach 100 on the D2 pass.


And it doesn't even reward silver for the time investment."
