politics,fekssps,t1_feks9nr,1579206859.0,If you’ve ever talked to people that we’re adults through Nixon and Vietnam many will talk about how it felt the same. Very defeating and like everything is screwed. Every generation has their hope taken away once in a while. We will get ours back when a progressive becomes prez
politics,feg4wkg,t1_feg4hws,1579077061.0,"Why would a government, comprised of many privileged people, want a system where they can’t leech money from the govt in the name of ‘helping societal welfare’?"
worldnews,fefw4v2,t1_feft8vl,1579067136.0,Yea. Story of my life unfortunately. Leaving for China in a couple weeks. Maybe I should bring them bottled water as courtesy gift BS.
Portland,fefvumb,t1_fedlscg,1579066864.0,"I see people try and play in the waters on the Oregon beaches. Some are clearly able to swim/surf in the summer waves and water. Strong and experienced swimmers. I see others who know to not enter past their knees because the surf goes out so far and intimidating for those who understand the power of the ocean without proper experience. 

Lastly I will see people recklessly walking/swimming into the waves up to chest or neck level. What the hell. If you’ve ever experienced the Atlantic, you can do this no problem. The undercurrent stops being strong after knee depth, unless there is a riptide. But the undercurrent or undertow in the Pacific is this hugeeee range. Goes from like ankle level water all the way up to where you can barely touch. Super dangerous.

I saw a family trying to play with a seal (also questionable for younger kids) and the mother started to get pulled further and further into the ocean! She lived because she grabbed onto a jetty! Very scratched and bleeding. It was such a tense five minutes. 

Also I’ve seen people approach crazy tides in winter with their children or pets. Adults can barely outrun these tides.... typically uphill if you consider Oregon’s dunes and geography.... definitely not beings with small strides! People who are even with or just slightly above water in any way when shits poppin off on the coast, do not understand at all the power of the ocean and how to walk near it in different seasons. 

Sorry about this rant but I have another really scary story. There’s a really cool tide pool place north of Florence OR. Maybe Lincoln city or something. I was there visiting the tides in the late spring so still the rainy season. The tide started coming in so I backed off a little bit but this family did not. A woman came by and was summoning them off the rocks. They had to climb down from the rock tide pool, cross the beach that fills up with water and climb up a dune/rock hill. As they’re being scolded by this woman for the dangers, a huge swell comes in and fills up the entire thing with water. It took only a few minutes for the tide pool rock to be covered with crashing waves. Really fucking crazy experience. Parents seemed really fucking scared."

If I don’t pressure wash it, it looks like I never even renovated the stupid barn because of hay dust and poop. Total shit. But I just pressure wash it three or four times a year and boom! I got a super lovely, dark and juicy color, where stinky animals are kept, for zero repaints after five years."

worldnews,fefb3rm,t1_fefauz5,1579052414.0,The water filters get trashed too fast around here. I used to get it delivered but there isn’t a ‘good source’ to fill up a five gallon anywhere in a 20 mile radius bc I live in the boonies. Basically all comes from Cali. The delivery fees were just stupid. I’m going to go into a five gallon delivery with two of my neighbors so we can all cut down on recyclables but it hasn’t happened yet.
worldnews,fefaki0,t1_fef971d,1579052060.0,Ahh I see. Thank you. Crazy how the housing bubble has crashed a few times over the last 100 years and no one even blinks an eye when it is happening again. Gosh I gotta sell my house lol.
relationship_advice,fef8rjy,t1_fee47tr,1579050864.0,"Happened to me too! Gosh it has been six years and I still think about him. So happy now and I think he is. Glad things worked out the way it did but the porn addiction really left a ‘what if’ feeling after the relationship that I had never experienced before. I felt so shitty in our sex life. Like how much do I have to do just to be ignored or rejected? 

The day I opened his computer after crying my emotional and horny self asleep, I found porn. His search history was FULL of it. I wanted him so bad for so many months/years. I woke him up, confronted him and he said his acne made him not worthy. I snapped a nerve and worked up the courage over the next month to end a once in a lifetime relationship. We were so great together and i thought for so long that ‘what if I just wasn’t a monkey who wanted sex?’  

Really stupid thought because I am a mammal that enjoys sex. But still think about it from time to time. It was the hardest break up of my life, but I absolutely deserved better and I’m glad I was able to realize that. Despite the pain."

worldnews,fef79y1,t1_fef4izs,1579049856.0,How practical is it to send water in a shipping container over long distances? I can’t see how it would make economical sense for China to bring in water but I’m ignorant. A water treatment plant isn’t a crazy investment for a country like China. The treatment technology is really prolific right now as well. Thanks for any info!
worldnews,fef6w78,t1_fef49dm,1579049601.0,I have disgusting water in my town. Can’t drink it. It makes me and my partners stomach hurt if we drink it. It smells like a pool lockerroom. It sucks because the town over has spring water and it’s delicious. I hate spending like $700 a year on water but I always buy from a local spring (earth2o) even thought it’s more expensive. Also made this sick 10x15 ft hanging garden with the gallon jugs.
SkincareAddiction,fedallm,t1_fecxcg7,1579005797.0,Ty so much for the advice. After a long consideration I am going to go with a bath bomb and some chocolate. Maybe wine for the people who host me. I wish I could pick them out good foreign beauty products but the whole process is too set on getting it perfect.
SkincareAddiction,fedac9w,t1_fed3pww,1579005543.0,"I think I’m going to go with some super simple bath bombs, chocolate and wine. It seems like a great co-Ed gift too. TYVM for the help."

SkincareAddiction,fecqrd8,t3_eogoq8,1578981148.0,"I want to bring my friends’ family skincare products back to China as presents. I am not Asian and just use a silly friend-made coconut oil mixture on my face; feel out of my league. I know skincare products can be a terrible idea, but mainland Chinese really like foreign beauty products. I am looking to spend about $50 a person as they are going to be housing me when I’m not working. Both male and female. I’m thinking two items but have no idea.

Does anyone have a recommendation for extremely general skincare products. For example, they’re extremely simple and can irritate no one, or are good for soothing rather than fixing, etc. Or just simple products that anyone would like? thanks soooo much for help."
politics,febp7jg,t1_fea5dru,1578961242.0,"They said in 2016 it was about 600k illegals getting a license across a state of 39 million. I have found absolutely nothing to back up your claim that more people voted in Cali than registered voters. Illegal immigrants getting a license caused a surge in adults that were well.... undocumented. Who would’ve thought? Doesn’t say anything about more votes than registered voters. 

You talk about things being promoted on Reddit and continue with trash facts that are half true or nonexistent. And with such passion! I see how Orange County could be impacted by these voters looking at the election results. However, you should have left it at that because now a possible issue (voter fraud) is being overlooked as readers are going to focus on your stupid shit."
AmItheAsshole,fe63ulo,t1_fe5v9pv,1578881182.0,"At least she gave it to a good cause and people who not only help themselves, but wildlife and homes.

I helped a family out last year. My SO was so against it but they were friends, had kids and needed a place to stay. They ended up being total pieces of shit and costing us a few thousand. We fought about it a bit but it isn’t brought up anymore and we just have an agreement to think twice before my heart gets to me. I might be sinister if there were rules set in place controlling one of my favorite personal qualities (altruism).

Just talk to her why that was weird AF for you and leave it at that. I doubt she will do it again."

AmItheAsshole,fdljz08,t1_fdjsf8z,1578525726.0,"I thought I understood the feeling until it happened to me after my dad wanted to spite me for moving across the country one Christmas. I was 20 but it hurt seeing my horde of younger siblings open like 7k worth of presents and never having to worry about college. I thought my family was normal but it’s clearly not. Also my step mom and I love the shit out of each other so it also confuses me. I think some people are just idiots. My dad doesn’t realize how unfair it is to pay for the siblings full ride to college and not mine. I’m also the only, oldest daughter with five younger bros. Could be sexism idk. Sorry this turned into a rant with no direction but my point was that until you feel that fire in your gut and have experienced it, a lot of people can’t imagine the salty feeling."

insanepeoplefacebook,fdcffco,t1_fdc784r,1578273570.0,"Mostly revolving around selling foreign goods to people through their China version facebooks. People are always trying to drag me in because I’m a foreigner that can access the goods. Companies and solo ‘hotshots’ will get Chinese to sell their goods to other Chinese in bulk or singular items. The ones selling in bulk are usually the ones who sell to the people selling singles; to be fair, it can be more direct in the less MLM style businesses. Finally, it can just repeat forever. The sellers gotta be prepared as sometimes the supplier is far or doesn’t want to meet with you all the time, so the single people,and even the bulk suppliers, have tons of extra stuff that didn’t sell. 

Very predatory but in a lot of ways less so than America. China has a steep tax on foreign luxury items. It is part of their phony ‘we are communist’ scheme. This leads to an almost need for the pyramid scheme whereas America we can access all the MLM items for almost the same price and with selection. It’s funny because in my experience govt officials are the highest consumer of black market luxury items. There are also much more typical MLM setups in China for Chinese vitamin supplements, prayer beads, makeup etc. but they don’t do nearly as well as the foreign goods so there is not comparison."
insanepeoplefacebook,fdc5jcb,t1_fdbquof,1578267520.0,The stay at home parent is rather uncommon in China I have noticed. It’s a place where pyramid schemes can actually work so maybe that’s part of it. Though most of the pyramid scheme-type pusher is younger. Almost all the mothers I know work. It’s the MIL or FIL who is stay at home.
worldnews,fd8bmq1,t1_fd5gk8r,1578216438.0,"Read a WW3 Iran meme last night before going to bed piss ass drunk. It put me over the edge and I had to vomit. I would’ve been fine if I hadn’t clicked on the link. 

I’ve lost about 7k this year from people subtlety draining my US bank account from China under my nose. The bank and I deemed it was from a purchase I linked to another country from my phone. We’re constantly being exploited but I have to say. My smart phone has been great in my dreams towards a sustainable way of living. It is a trade off."
