But there are two notable exceptions:

* Once the vehicle gets past a certain weight, you run into problems with heat dissipation.  All that kinetic energy turns into heat.  So a fully loaded truck needs more time to stop or else the brakes and tires would melt.  This is considered bad.

* If the vehicle is light enough, the rear can lift off the road.  So an empty truck needs longer to stop, or it would faceplant.  This is also considered bad.

That curved lake (The ""Old Danube"") was the original riverbed.  The current one is wider than the original, allowing for more water to flow through without flooding the city.  Then, another channel was added alongside the main channel (The ""New Danube"")

This gives the Danube flowing though Vienna a large volume that it can use during floods, protecting the downtown areas.  And when it isn't flooding, there are large bodies of water and islands available for recreation, separated from ship traffic.

Unfortunately, that isn't the case.  Let me introduce you to VMs...

All Hyper-V VMs use the identifier 00-15-5d.  This only allows for 256^3, or 16.8 million different MAC addresses.  Which means globally, collisions will happen.  But it gets worse.

The next two octets are from the last two octets of the host's first NIC's IPv4 address.  So any one host only has a pool of 256 possible MAC addresses.  And while the last octet of the host's IP likely is well-distributed, how many networks use 192.168.0.x or 1.x?  So the pool before global collisions are likely is more like 256^2, or 65,536 different MAC addresses.  And in larger networks, where VMs can jump around a lot, you *will* run into collisions.  The 257th VM spun up on a host will have a collision with one of the previous ones.

VMWare's allocation is a bit better, using a hash function of the UUID and hostname instead of the NIC, but MAC address collision is still something that needs to be watched for on larger networks.

Thankfully, the IPv6 address generated from the MAC Address is only a link-local address, so you only have to worry about IPv6 collisions within your own network."
