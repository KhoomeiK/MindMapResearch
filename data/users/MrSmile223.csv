>Everyone has the right to an opinion, that doesn't mean it's good or bad

This is bullshit. 

""How can you be mad at me? We clearly just have differing opinions about what is cheating.""

""What we can't be friends just because we disagree on women being people?""

Opinions can be shit.

*And even if they couldn't*, why then are you ragging on this person's *opinion*?"

Showerthoughts,few2lhk,t1_fev4vz2,1579404603.0,"You have it backwards, you already elaborate everything without words. People just 'translate' it into their head language.

A good example is eating food. You don't need words to enjoy the flavor, the feel, and how it was cooked, etc. You *feel* all this, all without words. 

...But then you try to explain why its good to friends, and its *hard*. Because thoughts on the food are abstract and 'bigger' than unpracticed language allows. 

Abstract thinking is like thinking in the 'untranslated' tastes you get while 'eating' experiences."

coaxedintoasnafu,fcl8u48,t1_fcl7vmm,1577742309.0,"Simply holding ideas makes real changes in the real world. (statistically, not individually)

E.g. If you had a choice between something ""made in china"" or not, which would you choose? (multiply that by trillions of transactions. Even if it only affects 1%, that's in the billions).

Sure talking about it online is not as ""useful"" as real action. But they aren't separate entities. One doesn't exist without the other. You *need* 100 people talking about something to get 1 person to do something.

Spreading ideas make little difference to an individual, but *super* important when considering millions of them. (Hence why geopolitical PR exists, or the great firewall of china, etc...)."

You got me there. The witcher is fictional. and she's not really a 'main role'. Plenty of other characters get more screentime.
