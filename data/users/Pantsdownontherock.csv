The statute of limitations to be charged was 6 months and I was charged with only a few days left. My lawyer asked in court when the blood test was submitted as evidence a month later and the magistrate said it was that day, which was outside the 6 month period so was ruled inadmissible and as there was no evidence the case was thrown out. And that's how dumb pre-20 year old me didn't completely fuck his life up."

sydney,fdmc5sy,t3_em1nlt,1578545263.0,"UTS is far far better for engineering, has a better location as far as bars, food and social activities go as it is located in the city itself. It is also located near Central station which is the major train hub and also a bus hub so you open up a lot of places that are cheaper to rent while not taking too long travelwise. 

You can look for a sharehouse in the inner west on www.flatmates.com.au as this will cut down on rent a lot, you will be likely living with people in similar life stages in areas that are also full of bars and restaurants with good public transport to the city."
