Anxiety,ffbz378,t3_est2zx,1579787281.0,"I have an owl. A beanie boo. Call him Hoot. The bf has made things for him like a hat, traveling cloak and a little dagger. If I go somewhere in a car he comes to. I call him my emotional support hoot. He helps when I am having a bad day and when things get really bad I have a bigger Owl to hug on. Other than them I watch funny videos on YouTube, or play a mobile game called Tap Tap Fish. Good to know there are other adults that have stuffed animals for anxiety relief."
