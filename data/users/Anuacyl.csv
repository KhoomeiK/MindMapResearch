I've been coughing and congested since the first cold day here, which never happened when cigarettes weren't in play. 

Maybe we can use the AA thing. They stand up and say ""hello, I'm name, and i don't want to drink anymore""  and maybe they don't mean it at first. Eventually though they mean it, kind of like affirmation. (At least according to a Stephen King book i read, not sure which one.) So..

Shake up your routine so that its more difficult to slip that stick back in there. And a personal advice, replace the oral fixation. Some use gum, tic tacs, toothpick, or drinking from a straw.

You are still young as a smoker, quitting is still more easily attainable. In Terry Pratchett Discworld series, it is said that vampires don't need blood to survive. So there is the blue ribbon league (think alcoholic anonymous), and the addiction to blood is replaced with another addiction. Coffee, light, art, photography, writing, etc.

The last time i tried quitting i used a McDonald's cup (or similar) to simulate the act of smoking (lifting to my mouth, taking a pull) to satisfy the oral fixation bit of smoking, but for the craving i delved into digital coloring via a free image manipulation program until it passed. Something that occupied my attention and distracted me while it passed.

However, the better you do in school, the better grants you can get for college (if such a thing interests you). What school does is offer a general selection of different topics for you to decide if any interest you. It gives you time to decide what you may want to do for profit.

However, life gets harder too. Think of it like a game where each level is harder and requires things that you learned and squired from previous levels to succeed.

You may be happier in later years, but you face other challenges.
