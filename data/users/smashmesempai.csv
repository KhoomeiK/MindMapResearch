MadeMeSmile,ff8uukt,t3_es6cm3,1579696867.0,The white dog looks like my sister's dog
aww,ff6z1wu,t1_ff6rzho,1579637825.0,Admittedly the corgi is the smallest medium dog. So I think you're still good
Tinder,fellxxn,t3_epo0h4,1579225331.0,"I do have an outstanding low kick, I could throw constantly at a good clip for about 40 mins. Plus good pacing and distance management. I guess my answer would be a question, what is the rate of kindergarteners coming at me? I can confidently take 5 kindergarteners per 10 minutes and hour. Probably take on more though, maybe 2 kindergarteners a minute, but that's a pretty fast clip."

nextfuckinglevel,fdwg2re,t3_en0an1,1578758296.0,Damn it's kinda hard finding a good mitt guy too. This kid is so lucky to have that kind of resources so early.
nextfuckinglevel,fdwfbfq,t3_en5oht,1578758143.0,Imma a Photoshop noob but you do need to physically take the bike out or have a second shot without the bike (or her) to clean slate it right?
MadeMeSmile,fdweich,t3_en6y4r,1578757881.0,Damn he's quick on the up take. Either he had planned to do this or his improv top notch.
MadeMeSmile,fdwdwgm,t3_en4o5r,1578757696.0,"Oh he's so cute. I want him to come out like Chad McChaderston with fist pumps and the I beat leukemia at 6 hero face, but he's too cute for that."

MadeMeSmile,fd24xzc,t3_ejrsre,1578141749.0,"What under funded school is this, he doesn't even sit at a legit desk, but some collapsible party table. Real passion right there"
gaming,fd17s8l,t3_ejoaay,1578128406.0,"I played this at launch and my Roach somehow wasn't as lit as everyone else's. I was sorely disappointed at my Roach, but no one tell her that"
MadeMeSmile,fd16uf3,t3_ejq05f,1578128085.0,"Regardless of motive imma still live semi vicariously (not even sure I'm using that word right, just wanted to sound smart) through him, since I never went to prom, and I'm just socially inept (not akward)."
gaming,fd15nm2,t3_ejo8m7,1578127787.0,"Damn, Alanis Morissette. Isn't this coincidence not irony. Writers have been blaming her for the conflation (not saying I am one). Not even hating on anyone but my inner sperg can't keep quiet."
ShittyLifeProTips,fcyyeh9,t3_ejff7h,1578089828.0,"We all joke, but now California has a law limiting people 55 gallons of water (per person). Outside of drought conditions. This is legit a good tip for them."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fch3zsg,t3_eh8fhx,1577647061.0,"Do not get the one originally ported to the PlayStation. There's a weird lag when moving through the menu, and going to the menu. It seems small at first, but does really annoy as time goes on. Make sure to get the Nintendo version!!"

MadeMeSmile,fc62lwn,t1_fc4q7xn,1577470858.0,"My class was the opposite, everyone looked at the person sharpening their pencil like ""damn you don't got another pencil"". Also it was pretty loud. The class trouble maker would use it often during a lesson."
