I don’t know why, but it’s one of the funniest photos of an astronaut I’ve ever seen. Amazing, but equally funny. Why would he do that? Was it planned? Did he look at his team and say, “Hey I’m gonna do it.” Did they try to stop him? Did they show him any restraint? Did they egg him on? Was it a bet? Did they dare him to do it? Like that scene from Finding Nemo: “He touches the butt..!”

Astronauts are wild, man."

AskReddit,fcnfaay,t3_ehtq3g,1577810525.0,"I started collecting screenplays. I’m not too crazy about it but I started as a kid because my parents hated putting subtitles on their movies when we would all watch them, so I either had to watch it on my own and really listen, or remain ignorant of what the characters said. 

With that in mind, I can look up screenplays and be done with it. But more than having physical copies of books, I loooove screenplay paperbacks. 

I have:

Good Will Hunting
Gladiator
The Shawshank Redemption
Before Sunrise
Before Sunset
Before Midnight 
The Grand Budapest Hotel
Airplane 
The Matrix 
Christopher Nolan’s Batman Trilogy 
Inception 


I’d love to have shooting scripts eventually"
