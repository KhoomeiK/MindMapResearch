You don't understand how announcing an investigation into his strongest political rival benefits trump directly?  Wow.  He didn't ask for a real infestation even...haha he just wanted it announced for the headlines.  That's what sondland testified to.  
How can this be about corruption if he didn't even really want them to investigate?  

The aid was withheld. That's against the law as per the gao.  Whether it was released eventually doesn't matter at all.  He failed to faithfully execute congresses order the instant he held it up.  That's abuse of power.  Charge 1.
Ukraine was already cleared to get that money. Any corruption questions has already been settled.

Sad.

I really like how you bring up clinton tho.  I notice right wingers just can't justify trumps behavior so they try the clinton did it too card.  I hope she pays u rent cuz she's living in your head and for all the investigations there has never been one charge against her.

Again you really need to do some research because u just don't get what impeachment is or how it works. 

For instance the wh lawyers don't get to dictate when or if they'll comply with an impeachment inquiry.  
Subpoena literally means under penalty.  Its already been decided by the courts and the constitution itself says the house will have the sole power of impeachment.  It doesn't say ""unless the wh lawyers think dems are unfair""."

""I remember he asked for an investigation into corruption and never brought up any consequences for not doing so""

Not true.  Many people testified ukraine knew that not saying an investigation was being started meant no wh meeting and no money. Your statement here is simply a lie.  Sondland testified trump didn't care if an investigation was started he just wanted it announced.  This blows the ""trump was concerned admit corruption"" argument out of the water.


""Ukrainians didn't even know the money was being held up""

This is also not true.  Multiple people testified they knew.  Again you've used another debunked talking point.

""and Zalinsky came out and said publicly that there was no pressure.""

This is the only thing you've said that is actually true.  However its out of context and Zelenski knows he still has to try to work with trump.  You really think he'd publicly discredit someone who's thumb he is still under?"
