depression,fel0grx,t1_fejraeo,1579211416.0,"Me too. I also am terrified of being hospitalized, and as a minor, this gives me even less control. So, I have in the past been very dishonest about self harm with my family and therapist. I hate having to worry about things like that."
depression,fekyjxi,t3_epiyby,1579210268.0,"I tend to imagine that I find someone special. That I’m with them, or that I’m in the process of being with them. I imagine love and what it would be like, the warm feeling of blissful joy, being blind to anything except the moment where I’m in a state of genuine emotional value. I dream that I’m comfortable, and happy, and that my world functions correctly.

And then I realize that I’m only a dreamer, and that I’m but a folly."
depression,feh9zn8,t3_ep4bw6,1579112237.0,For me that date is coming up; mine was always what u expected to be at the start of college... we’ll see if I can improve or not.
depression,feg15zq,t1_feg10hp,1579072507.0,"Well I think that’s dependent on each situation. I think the study showed most couples, despite the fact that some may have been very happy, still preferred the chocolate TECHNICALLY. However, if asked if they prefer the chocolate or to remain in the relationship, they likely would have chose the relationship. You are right, you shouldn’t be in a relationship you don’t like."

depression,fefoc1m,t1_fefnecn,1579060759.0,"I know that’s true. I really do. I’ve come to that conclusion on my own and realized that I’m depressed, and because I’m depressed, I want to remain depressed. I’ve gotten better and know I can get back, but it’s a slow climb and a long fall if I screw up. I managed to feel great about life over this Pat summer, but during my marching band season (I’m one of those), my band director yelled at me constantly for screwing up. I forgot my music, my lyre, I stood up too soon, whatever. It was at a point where people would make a joke about it, “how many times will he get yelled at this week.” (Not in a bullying sense, oc, as I would also often make light of the situation to calm my nerves). After a while, I’ve become classically conditioned to feel anxious just by walking into the band room. I always think I’m missing something or screwing up. So I stopped enjoying one of the few things that I used to really enjoy and socialize in outside of the few videogames i play. Then, schoolwork got more intense, but at first that was fine as I expected it. It was only after my mom kept on bringing up college, and a future that I would get stressed out of my mind again. I tried to pretend it didn’t exist, and even after I had applied I felt I was totally unprepared. Finally, one day, I just broke down. I laid down in the shower for about 4 hours, and just thought about how I might be bipolar, and then went into another spiral. Since then, I went back to therapy more often (until my therapist recently said that she can no longer help me and so I’m out of a therapist now), and tried to socialize a bit more. I’m getting slowly back out but it’s hard. And sometimes I can’t help but wonder what the point of it all is. Why be alive if life is so cruel? It doesn’t make much sense to me.

In any case, I do have one minor achievement; I’ve managed to not cut myself throughout this latest experience. Hoping to keep it that way. I also pride myself on my resistance to alcohol and drugs; I’ve managed to prevent myself from getting even worse in that sense."
depression,fefmick,t1_fefme8g,1579059532.0,"Yep, New Jersey. The BEST of the states. Our school prides itself on a high college acceptance rate so, my counselors only made my life harder (pressuring me into a math class I didn’t want to take)."
depression,fefmeht,t1_fefm2mc,1579059461.0,"Thank you. I definitely have the same struggles you had, and I also have in the past talked with some teachers. The issue is that I’m in some AP courses, and while with regular courses I can get away with missing assignments and extensions, I absolutely have to do the work for my AP European History course... which is a 4 hour reading. I can’t read books anymore, because like you said, I tend to have to reread a passage over and over despite at one point being far ahead of my class in reading level (way long ago now). I’ve done as much as I really can in terms of making my life a bit easier in coursework, however living in a more wealthy area, I suppose more is expected of me."
depression,fefj7g3,t1_fefj2tf,1579057455.0,"Well the thing is it’s difficult to do that. It’s probably half the battle of depression, so I find it very difficult to get outside of my room when I’m not in school. I’m working on getting better slowly but hanging out with friends a few times a week, but it’s still very difficult."
depression,fefi992,t1_feeud27,1579056878.0,"Yea but if I stop distracting myself, I quickly become depressed. When I’m left alone with my thoughts, I can’t help but become alone and feel despair."
depression,fefhsfn,t1_fefhkqj,1579056599.0,"Honestly, at this point, it doesn’t matter. I’m graduating this year (senior) and the counselors truthfully aren’t helpful. There was a point where I was able to leave class if I used a special pass, but I used it too much and the absences still applied “. I have 2 more marking periods left... I’ll just touch it out and take the 30 or so mental breakdowns I have left."

depression,fedxr99,t3_eomy2w,1579022125.0,"I feel that there are times where the subreddit appears hopeless... but you have to acknowledge that it’s run by extremely depressed people who either just want to vent or are looking for approval from others. Sometimes that’s what a person needs though.

Nevertheless, I’d say that there ARE some posts and such that receive support. There are a lot of depressed people, however on the sub. So you may not always get many responses on a post. 

I would like to offer my support, though, so hang in there man."
depression,fedxfd2,t1_fed4bv8,1579021928.0,I’ve literally become handicapped when it comes to reading. What should be a 3 hour assignment takes me 6 or 7 because of how often I take 10-50 minute breaks. I   c a n n o t   pay attention in class.
depression,fedxa9b,t3_eojiuf,1579021842.0,I have had days where someone won’t respond to a text so I’ll be like “fuckfuckfuck what did I say?” And then the next day they seemingly didn’t even think about it. So basically an anxiety attack for about 10 hours that equates to... nothing.
SuicideWatch,fedx5pt,t1_fedrtwi,1579021766.0,"Yea; I would say that at first when you get a handle on it, it’ll take a few more tries before you really become comfortable with it. Once you do though, it’s always fun to use them. If for nothing else, then to make people you’re eating with slightly impressed with you."
SuicideWatch,feco0p7,t1_fecjx6v,1578978758.0,"I wouldn’t assume; it’s fairly simple to learn though I think. The next time you’re eating Asian food, if you look up “how to use chopsticks” and go to images there’s a few pictures to help out."
SuicideWatch,fecibqz,t1_feci7iy,1578974609.0,"Well, because I was a weeb for a while I learned how to use chopsticks. It’s really fun to watch some of my Asian friends struggle with it while I know how to use them correctly lmao"
SuicideWatch,fecg8zq,t1_fecg0qv,1578973178.0,Im glad that you are able to enjoy your food! I hope you’re able to hold up for a while; at least long enough to try as much sushi as the world can provide.
depression,feam9mo,t1_fe8yu81,1578950248.0,"Yea, I know what you mean. Sometimes if feels pretty hopeless to make others happy if you aren’t getting anything out of it. I guess it’s just that generally when I make others happy, I tend to share a small amount of their joy. Even if only a little. Sometimes that small fraction of joy can at least trick me into thinking it’s worth it."

SuicideWatch,fe78npq,t1_fe6mgjv,1578911495.0,"My dad killed himself. He lived for years without talking to more than 10 people. There were at least 50 people at his funeral. I was shocked because I didn’t remember him having any friends at all. The truth is, no matter the distance, you will be missed. Anything else you tell yourself is a lie to make it seem easier. That being said, I won’t blame you or say it’s your fault if you do. Life is hard. But I feel it’s worth mentioning that the concept of distance only serves to make people feel they shouldn’t have allowed that distance to form to begin with."
SuicideWatch,fe788ey,t3_eo11fr,1578911271.0,"The best way to find it; get outside. Go get food with a friend. Or to the gym. Or a walk through the park. When you are outside, take a deep breath. Feel good while you can, and remember what it’s like. Odds are you’ll feel down again, so you’ll want those memories as proof that you can feel good again when you ARE down."
SuicideWatch,fe780dq,t3_eo17pu,1578911163.0,"You’re not alone. I’m here, and I hear you. The truth is that the world has always had war, and always will have war. It’s a matter of disagreement. Hate is a cruel thing, but for some it can’t be helped, it’s all they know. Still, you’re more valuable alive than dead. You’ve become a recluse, but that doesn’t mean everyone has given up on you. Just find 3 people. 3 people that you can be good friends with. That’s all. I think that’s enough to keep you happy for however long you live."
depression,fe70b1h,t3_eo1yza,1578908365.0,"I also suffered from self harm. Sometimes it’s tough not to unscrew my pencil sharpener, but I know that it’s so much better not to do it. It’s been 2 years-ish since I’ve last REALLY done it. I mean I’ve kinda relapsed, but not really. Good on you for making it this long, you can continue and make it. There are other ways to get dopamine and joy. I hope all works out well :)"

depression,fe6yyac,t1_fe6xs3l,1578907853.0,"(Be honest) have you not had a single day, a single hour, where you felt happiness in the past year? Of course life sucks. You have depression. But you aren’t as alone as you think you are. There is someone, at least one person in your life. I’m sure of it. A family member, a friend, whatever. You just need to make connections with people to feel happy, even if only for a moment. The truth is, we have trouble getting happiness because of our depression. So we have to fight 100 times harder for the same joy a normal person gets. But that also makes that joy 100 times better, doesn’t it?"
depression,fe6y19j,t3_eo1usb,1578907626.0,"If it helps, I can’t even get a part time job. I can’t even do schoolwork. The truth is, I’m at the point where all I have to do is pass English class and I’m done with school. Forever. But I have 7 other classes and I’m constantly stressed. People aren’t always able to understand that, and it’s easier some days then others. You can handle what you can handle. Do your best. Unfortunately, when it comes to other people putting you down, the best you can do is just force yourself to think that they don’t mean what you think they mean. They aren’t making fun of you, even though that’s how it feels. And you just have to deal with how you feel, honestly. You’re doing ok though. You’ve gotten far, and you HAVE a job, which is already better than I can do. Take your time, and try to appreciate as much of life as you’re able."
depression,fe6wwbm,t1_fe6wrfe,1578907025.0,"Well that’s the reason that I suggested general happiness as a way to give your life a meaning. In terms of existential importance, perhaps for many there isn’t much of a reason for existence, but if you are happy, or can provide happiness for someone else, then doesn’t your existence become somewhat more valid?"
depression,fe6t2yf,t1_fe6str7,1578904117.0,"Oc. I know what it’s like to go through a breakdown, and I know it’s tough. I hope you’ll be able to find whatever it is you need and feel better overall."
depression,fe6swyg,t1_fe6sqz2,1578903881.0,"The truth is you have 2 options;

1. Accept your situation and allow depression to consume you

2. Attempt to find a light at the end of the tunnel. 

You could choose the first option, and either spend your whole life slowly rotting away, or end it all. Or you could try option 2 and possible get to a point in time where life makes sense. Where you won’t wake up and feel so groggy. Where you’re truly happy. When you can understand what it’s like to be “normal,” even if only for a day. Option 2 is to fight depression. Option 1 is to become depression. Choose which one you think would be better based on what you want. Do you really WANT to just give up, or do you think happiness is worth it?"
depression,fe6sqz2,t3_eo182v,1578903652.0,It means you find a guy named Depression and beat the crap out of him.
depression,fe6sivx,t3_eo15ye,1578903345.0,"I understand. Breakdowns are hard to deal with. Unfortunately, not everyone understands, and it seems your boyfriend simply doesn’t get it. I would say that if he isn’t able to support you, that he’s not able to function correctly as a boyfriend and that its preferable to try moving on from him anyways, as he can’t treat you in the correct way. If you have any friends, I would cling onto them while you shift into a period without him. One of the biggest downsides to mental illness is how helpless it makes us at times. We sometimes become reliant on others for support, and then because of that, we drain them. Then, we become depressed because we lost someone close to us, and that it was “our fault.” This isn’t necessarily true, but it’s how at least I tend to perceive it. I feel that there are people out there who are able to support you in the way that you need, and that you’d be better trying to find them. Or alternatively, find multiple people who can help you, so that in the case that you don’t think you can go to one person (because you’ve already asked quite a bit from them), you can go to another. Between a therapist, a handful of good friends, and a truly compassionate boyfriend, you should be able to have a well functioning support system."
depression,fe6s5mw,t3_eo173a,1578902850.0,"I feel this. I can’t ever feel normal anymore. It really does feel like there isn’t a way to fix myself anymore. Therapy doesn’t work, I can’t go on medication because I’m 17 and my mom won’t sign off on it, and I’m not even sure if it’ll work. I can’t ever get school work done on time, I try to ignore all conversations about colleges, and I can’t get a job or even drive because the responsibility gives me anxiety. I feel like I have friends, but that it doesn’t matter much because I can’t reciprocate the friendships. I’m not able to buy anyone gifts, or drive people places, or live a normal high school life as a senior. I can’t get a girlfriend, or be honest with people because of my anxiety. I can’t party or socialize either because that’s the worst kind of anxiety. I feel inadequate at everything I do, and I’m not sure exactly what I’m living for."
SuicideWatch,fe6rssh,t3_enz1ux,1578902360.0,"I say do be honest. But not completely or always. I know that if I am totally honest with all of my friends, that they will see me as a morbid nihilist. Even still, if I’m having an exceptionally hard time, I find it’s better to be upfront when someone says “how are you?” They usually don’t expect a “not great, honestly,” or “pretty bad,” but I know that if I keep saying “I’m doing well,” or “I’m fine,” that the dishonesty will only hurt me. Friends and family are there to support you, and so usually they do. For that reason, I am only honest when I really need the support, as it can be a real comfort sometimes to have someone respond to my negative comment with a “well it’ll get better,” or some other useless thought that just shows that I’m cared for. It’s nice to be loved, even if only a little."
SuicideWatch,fe6rh71,t3_enzgqz,1578901926.0,"I think you should tell her you’re depressed and need therapy. When I first became depressed, I let it fester and build up. One day, I just let it go off and told my mom how I felt. Luckily, I wasn’t hospitalized, but I would have a therapist. I think that, especially if this is new (under a year), therapy is the way to go. The only thing is, if course, that you have to actually want to feel better. Part of depression is that you may not feel the motivation to feel better, so you’ll have trouble forcing yourself through that. Hopefully this helps a bit."
SuicideWatch,fe6qx7c,t1_fe6gqoc,1578901193.0,"I am/was in therapy. My therapist kinda gave up on me, so... anyways, it helps. It’s just a matter of how much it helps. If you’re going once a week, and your depression doesn’t make you not wanna go, then it works better then if you go inconsistently. If you have the financial resources to go twice a week, and you actively go, it can be beneficial if you’re severely depressed. Unfortunately, it takes time. Each time, your therapist will dig a little deeper and help you a little more. To open up is hard though, and can take a long time as well. I’m on therapist 3 and going into 4 I think, and I’ve been depressed for 3 years now. I take no medication and would say that my life is held together by a string right now, and if it snaps, I’ll probably breakdown totally. So to summarize; it helps, but it takes time. 
P.S.; from what I’ve heard, it’s best if you take medication while also being in therapy and are on a healthy schedule. But what do I know?"
SuicideWatch,fe6qfmt,t3_enzvp5,1578900568.0,"I suppose I would use those 10 days to try my hardest to find a reason to live. If I knew the exact day that I wanted to do such a thing, I would spend them all searching for a way to feel happy again. Even if I knew I was going to end it all, happy or not, on that 10th day. Just to be able to feel happiness again one more time before hand. But I don’t really know for sure, because I don’t think I would ever commit to a time like that."
depression,fe6plyb,t3_enxqyo,1578899527.0,"Personally, I feel Catholicism is too ceremonious. A lot of what is done in the Catholic Church is ritualistic. Holidays, fasts, confessions, blah blah blah. I’m a Protestant Christian myself, and I do feel my religion HELPS. It grounds myself in a way; gives me a more definitive outcome and reason for life. And it has been proven that religion makes a person happier generally speaking. Unfortunately, with religion comes a great deal of controversy. People will tell you to cling solely to God, or whoever else, and while I feel it is true to an extent, we are on earth. God is separate from Earth, and so he doesn’t just make us feel better if we ask. And there are things out of our control, including the way we feel. That’s not to say that we can’t sort of control how we feel, but at times we really can’t control things such as suicidal thoughts or urges, or feelings of despair, or anxiety, or whatever. My point is that when it comes to religion, interpret it how you want to. Do your own studies, and don’t blindly follow the religion just because it’s tradition, I guess. You yourself can decide if something is selfish, if you can help it at all, and if you are the one at fault. But I personally don’t think you are to blame for those thoughts. Especially if you want to feel better at all, since that shows you don’t necessarily want to feel the way you do."
depression,fe6p489,t3_envt2j,1578898930.0,"Be careful if you do continue. Go slowly so as to not cut too deep, wash your wounds with hydroxide or some other form of cleaner to prevent infection, and consider only doing that on places people won’t see, like your upper arm or on your legs.

depression,fe6ob22,t3_enx6ff,1578897968.0,"My dad killed himself 5 years ago. I wish nothing more than for him to be alive to help me now. He was similar to you, as he didn’t often leave the house or do much. He worked from home, but most of his time was spent watching tv. Even still, he meant the world to me. Just his being there was often comforting to me, and if he was around, he could have helped me to understand better how I feel now. Ultimately, you will tell yourself that you’re useless. That’s part of your mind and how it works. But just being there is likely enough so long as your daughter knows you care for her."
