Except for those characters, POV characters never (permanently) die in their own POV, which until the show passed the books was considered a major hint that Jon would live or be resurrected."
books,ffs9rpc,t1_ffr2eg2,1580176607.0,"> Gene Wolfe’s stories often have some framing device that acts as a kind of lens to view the work through. Book of the New Sun has an Afterword (which is part of the book’s fiction) that explains that Wolfe is not the author of the work, but merely the translator of a found book, and he’s struggled with word choices and such, which adds another layer of unreliability on top of the unreliable layer cake of narratives that is that story. Another features a story written by an anthropologist studying an indigenous alien species of shape shifters, and may himself be one of them who has forgotten that he is.

The usual example given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was imagining you were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you’d tamed the land, invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbours were cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had, you were in a position of near-absolute power and control which your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass . . . when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks come ashore and announce you’ve just been discovered, you’re all subjects of the Emperor now, he’s keen on presents called tax and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests."""
