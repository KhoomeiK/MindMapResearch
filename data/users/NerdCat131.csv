cats,fdnk7zl,t3_em2wx2,1578587538.0,Happy Peggy Sue day!! What a fantastic floof!!
AskReddit,fdjuk1r,t1_fdi7puy,1578487976.0,We had something similar...soak old breadrolls in a mix of milk and eggs...fry off with butter and roll in sugar/cinnamon. Quick and delicious
cats,fdi4let,t1_fdhch5g,1578435634.0,"Most likely...She used to be feral before she decided to move in with us, so we don't really know. Same as her age, we can only guess. We had her for 20 years now but have no idea how old she was when she came to us (had several litters of kittens before we could get her to get neutered)"
cats,fdhsr8n,t1_fdhnw8f,1578429471.0,I did and she sends a loud MEOW back!
cats,fdhsily,t1_fdgvhhv,1578429335.0,"She's always been low maintenance, there's no secret I'm afraid (other than unlimited pets and belly rubs, but that goes without saying). Guess we were just lucky with her!"
cats,fdhs85q,t1_fdgq7qg,1578429173.0,"Only very rarely to be honest. I think in 20 years we brought her to the vet twice...once when she finally had enough trust in us so we could bring her to the vet to get neutered (she was feral before and had quite a few kittens...all in our backyard! We homed the kittens once they were old enough but were running out of friends/family who wanted cats. So that trip to the vet was a blessing, also for her) and then recently when she had an ear infection. Other than that she's in good shape."
cats,fdgzz4b,t1_fdgna68,1578412370.0,"She certainly knows how to strike a good pose! 
You can certainly see she's not a kitten anymore but I just adore that little face"
cats,fdgzqk7,t1_fdgqrnx,1578412217.0,Disgruntled slipper on the floor...I can just picture this! Hehe
cats,fdgulxw,t1_fdgtlnu,1578408722.0,So sorry to hear this! Having to let your kitty go always sucks :/
cats,fdguf6s,t1_fdgtvmw,1578408588.0,"Took it this morning...it's all the belly rubs, it keeps her young apparently :)"
cats,fdgo0ri,t1_fdgnqv5,1578403626.0,Nowadays she's 99% of the time indoors. Preferring the warmth of her favourite spot to the outside
cats,fdgkv0p,t1_fdgk8be,1578400723.0,"She gets a mix of wet and dry food, dry food is for senior cats but nothing special otherwise. We're checking her teeth regularly too.

She used to be a feral cat but is with us now for 20 years. No idea how old she was when she moved in with us"
cats,fdge2lv,t3_el9pdk,1578392395.0,"What a cutie!!

Got a black kitty named Salem too. Such a great name!"
AskReddit,fd0zt0d,t3_ejro6w,1578126005.0,"I live in a different country than my parents. Dad was in bad health for a while and on one of my visits I gave him a kiss abd a long cuddle before leaving.

 Little did I know he'd pass away a month later and even though I immediately rushed to my mum after she told me, I never got to see him again. (He died at home and got picked up. He always wanted to be cremated and then be buried at sea)

I still think about that exact moment when I hugged him and it always makes me cry."
AskReddit,fcoj5v1,t1_fcog20g,1577833532.0,"I agree...just been 'convinced' to playtime by cuteness overload. They really do know how to play us like a fiddle!
Enjoy the mulled wine and give your kitty a chin scratch from me!"
AskReddit,fcofsyz,t1_fcn4i0u,1577831192.0,"Yes!! Exactly this...had a nice dinner, a bottle of wine, some sweets and binging on some Netflix with my cats next to me on the couch."
childfree,fcmtehz,t1_fcmq6ur,1577791366.0,"I second this. I'm in my late 30s and I've been going through the same thing. If it wasn't kids and family then it was their career taking them elsewhere. As Sethra is saying, it's important to be open to new friendships. Go out, do stuff that you like and you'll meet like minded people."
childfree,fcmrbko,t1_fckk0vk,1577788382.0,Furbaby promises are real!
AskReddit,fcjugoj,t1_fcjdh8g,1577705312.0,"I tend to go out alone a lot and I would never leave my drink unattended. However, once I'm pretty sure someone put something in my drink. I was at a club, it was kinda full and I was standing close to the dance floor with my drink next to me on a table. At the same table (it was a long table) were a bunch of guys that I've never seen before there. This was my regular place, I basically knew everyone even if it was just from seeing. 

&#x200B;

Now, before going to this club I was at a concert but only had 1 beer. While I was at the club I started drinking a cider. I was about halfway through that cider when I started to feel nauseous. I'm not a heavy drinker but it would take more than a beer and a cider (over the course of 4+ hours) to make me drunk enough to feel nauseous. 

Luckily I made my way to the next taxi rank and went home. Taxi driver had to stop mid-way so I could puke my guts out. Just about made it to the front door and kept sitting there all night before I even felt well enough to crawl upstairs and into my bed. Felt sick for days afterwards. Still horrifies me to this day...ugh"
misophonia,fcjo6ek,t1_fcj3b9r,1577696203.0,That is disgusting on so many levels..
misophonia,fci1n0x,t1_fcfven3,1577656664.0,Ugh yes! I usually go at odd times when there won't be many ppl about. Been dying to see the new Star Wars and finally decided to go on New Years Day in the morning...obviously hoping there won't be too many people. Keeping my fingers crossed!
Dublin,fadgypo,t1_facafuh,1575971013.0,"Not sure if this is an option for you, but there a few student accommodations around the city centre (and close to the bus routes you're looking for) that still have capacity. Think some of them start with 180/week, all bills included. It;s not a bad deal, especially when you're only staying for a few months. (I'm not sure if there's a minimum stay but if so I don't think it would be more than a semester anyway)"
