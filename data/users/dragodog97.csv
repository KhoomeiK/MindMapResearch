dogs,ff43bmj,t3_erjde5,1579554624.0,"That’s a really well versed post and a nice analysis of dog parks. It also made me realize how different dog parks can be from where I come from, where you eventually know all the dogs and owner at some point so it’s easy to decide if you want to enter or leave depending on who’s there.

Your dogs reaction is nothing to worry about, she’s growing up and gets more comfortable to give feedback. She might still submit to bad behavior from other bullies but in that case she decided to put a stop to it."
dogs,feydg5m,t1_fey8mq9,1579444116.0,You’re right - I confused this term with puppy mills. Backyard breeder is the correct term in this case...
dogs,fexzpc6,t3_eqv3be,1579438860.0,The most important thing would be to figure out when and why these attacks happen and what triggers Peeper to lash out. You mentioned jealously - so maybe you’re giving one dog affection and the other dog gets too close?

Maybe can recognize them on this page. There are better sites like this here: https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/ but you have to continuously click on “Show more” to see all breeds..."

dogs,feqkalg,t3_eqbxi3,1579342852.0,"Some dogs don’t like the barking. My dog has been corrected once by another dog twice her size. It’s a friendly dog otherwise and she has been given her a fair warning before (at which point I should have called my dog back). What she learnt was to never bark at this dog again, didn’t change behavior towards other dogs.

With some dogs this seems to be in their genetic makeup and probably hard to stop by training."
dogs,feknals,t3_epo2jt,1579203603.0,"Talk to their owners - they are the ones that know their dogs and what they would consider normal play and at which point they might feel it’s getting too rough and would rather stop their dogs.

I would also mention the “jealousy” issue.

And there’s no shame in asking these questions, you don’t know these dogs, their owners do. But they seem like responsible owners so that shouldn’t be an issue."
reactivedogs,feklg08,t3_epdlsr,1579202500.0,"Introduce them slowly by taking both dogs on a walk. Both leashed and preferable on neutral ground. At distance at first, maybe alternate who’s walking in the front or back so they both can get accustomed to each others scent. Slowly reduce the distance when both owners feel it’s safe to do so. You don’t necessarily have to force this on your first walk..."
reactivedogs,fekkp0y,t3_epjucn,1579202056.0,"I just want to add that the difference between an obese and a slim dog might just be 10% fewer calories for a couple of months.

And instructions are just guidelines and imo are usually at the upper end of what the average dog might need."
reactivedogs,fehhzq7,t3_eof9au,1579116927.0,"I have a similar dog, super scared as puppy, initially food aggressive towards us but this was easy to fix. He started showing symptoms of resource guarding at around two years when he get’s our attention or when he’s next to us on the coach and our older dog gets too close. She’s mentally much stronger but chooses to shy away from such a confrontation (smart girl) unless he gets furious.

It’s not always like this and seems to correlate with when he had a stressful day and/or is tired.

What really helped a lot was just to tell him to “get off” (when he’s on the coach) or a simple “no” when we were petting him (and obviously stop giving him attention). We trained the “get off” with rewards initially and try to not put too much emotions into these situations.

Interestingly if I call them both to get some pets or on the coach there’s never any bad reaction from him.

Another side note - I sometimes allow both dogs to sleep in my bed and I had to send him off once when he was threatening my other dog. He was really pissed but he never complained again (still happens on the coach occasionally)."
reactivedogs,feh9ztv,t3_eoximu,1579112241.0,If both you and your boyfriend work together on this it might be doable with proper management. Like giving her time to settle in when you move. You should get some time to prepare your dog when he’s having friends over. And make sure all guests are instructed to not approach or interact with your dog.
reactivedogs,feeornh,t3_eobseh,1579038067.0,"Really hard to say, if you ever want to involve a trainer be sure to take some videos of these occurrences, might save a lot of time and money.

You mentioned this now also happens in the yard - is there anything these situations have in common - like a toy involved or when he’s sleepy and lying down?

I would definitely work on getting him more comfortable with being touched, short sequences, reward with treats, etc..."
dogs,fearr7d,t3_eo6jg5,1578951644.0,Not sure how hard-coded your cat’s internal alarm clock is but have you tried to give him a bigger part of his daily amount of food in the evening?
dogs,feainzp,t1_fe9kjbp,1578949279.0,"> One of my really nice neighbors with dogs like this likes to let them outside when I’m walking by because the dogs start barking in the house

Been there - met another dog who was going apeshit, barking, lunging - I thought “thank god he’s leashed” right before the lady let him free..."
reactivedogs,fdxl0de,t3_emk7rj,1578770010.0,"I’ve seen a couple of times how much influence dogs can have on each other - like one of my dogs on new years eve did so much better when she had dogs around her that just didn’t care about the explosions. Or one dog that decides that this jogger running along the fence needs immediate attention and triggers five other dogs that joined him running off and barking (although a couple of them stopped mid track realizing that they are good dogs and they shouldn’t do this).

For me it’s the other way around, adult dog who is just perfect with everyone and a puppy that is reactive. She started to give passing dogs weird looks and correct our reactive puppy (which sounds great in theory but really prevents him from making his own experiences and severely affected my training).

What helped was walking/training them separately."
reactivedogs,fdxdt1k,t3_en3rtj,1578767739.0,"https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/how-to-handle-reactive-dogs

This just sounds like one of my own dogs - not really aggressive, can in theory deal with other dogs or humans off the leash but still has a bad reaction if he’s confined or approached to offensively. Just the regular reactive dog that is shy and a little fearful of the world around him.

The basic idea is to desensitize them to whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by teaching them commands like “look at me” and reward them. And slowly getting them closer to their triggers without freaking out.

One thing I want to add is - try to avoid the situation where your dog gets triggered inside the house or outside the yard, that will just become a bad habit and might affect your training. No idea how to avoid this in your case, maybe partial blinds on the window?"
dogs,fdwzp7s,t1_fdwv0be,1578763817.0,"I might have phrased that badly, it sounded like a weird advice so I wanted to add that you don’t have to get your puppies outside that frequently unless they’re active or you’ve been feeding them."
dogs,fdwp4lo,t1_fdwf37l,1578760988.0,do you set an alarm and wake up your puppy every 20 minutes? with proper management they should be able to sleep for up to three hours.
