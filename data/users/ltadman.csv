AmItheAsshole,ff40p0j,t1_ff3ilf5,1579552996.0,"This is a totally subjective opinion. I love speeches, they’re one of my favourite parts of a wedding. Reddit gets such a bee in their bonnet about wedding costs and speeches, the reason many of these traditions exist is because people *like them*."
fatlogic,fewrnr4,t1_fevut10,1579418476.0,"Of course clothing size has a relation, a UK 16 will never be a US 16. Even if the clothing isn’t totally standardised, that makes a significant difference."
fatlogic,fev5tgx,t1_feskuhb,1579393447.0,Also Britain has different sizing. I’m a British size 8 and an American 2/4.
fatlogic,fev5n34,t1_fes887r,1579393409.0,"This is absolutely not true. I’m surprised no one has pointed out yet that a British 16 is more like an American size 10 or 12.

I’m a UK 8 and can easily fit in to an American size 2."
LoveIslandTV,fepykfj,t1_feo97gt,1579334717.0,"I’m not sure, it’s the same reason people love First Dates so much - you actually get to meet the people *in person*, not just behind a screen"
LoveIslandTV,fempcf6,t1_femfovj,1579265571.0,"I disagree, I think it probably feels a lot like it’s about love when you’re in there. You can hear how protective they are about their couplings already."
dankchristianmemes,fdx7pej,t1_fdwtta5,1578766116.0,I just bought tickets! I am so excited I can’t even explain.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd9mwwu,t1_fd7gh2l,1578235505.0,"I was in ATL airport today too! Soldiers absolutely everywhere, people were besides themselves thanking them all."
AmItheAsshole,fd89nc5,t1_fd75uvd,1578215543.0,I’m sorry that happened to you but OP’s post could not be more different.

asheville,fbh6dv7,t1_fbglhsq,1576866351.0,Thanks!
