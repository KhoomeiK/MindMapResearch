ChoosingBeggars,ff5ucx0,t1_ff5u9ge,1579610553.0,It's just a red flag for now.  OP is just inb4 CB.

offmychest,felisla,t3_epsudm,1579223185.0,"Live every day you can (cause nobodyis perfect everyday) like you could be that person got somebody else, OP. :) It's amazing when we meet people like that and all respect to her for lifting you up instead of pushing you down. Keep it up, stranger, you've got this.

And happy cake day!"

Shredding/cutting could work. Prevent yourself from being able to pull it back out and read it.  And the cease and desist might not work on it's own, but if you can prove that you sent one, it will go further to prove you're being harassed. But it's a lot of work and up to you c:"

justdependathings,fd7onyd,t1_fcwb0qu,1578207700.0,"I disagree.  Not even from a dependa standpoint - I don't think it's healthy to see ""our money"" as a concept.  A married couple can be incredibly happy having separate finances in general.  And if that's uncomfortable, then make the monthly expenses based on income - each person pays a % of the expenses based on income ratios."

justdependathings,fd7ms5y,t3_ejsny4,1578206881.0,"Okay, can i point out, most of these jokes are being made \*by\* military folks (active duty/reserve/guard alike) \*for\* military folks? It's literally how we cope with news like this...  Fuck a dependa for thinking that they get to be offended by the only thing that brings some of us comfort/joy."

Edit: or is r/SubsIFellFor still a thing?"
raisedbyborderlines,fd7kjcb,t3_ek6fbh,1578205928.0,"Keep up the g r e a t work, OP :) You nailed it.  It won't always be so simple, but be true to yourself and you will be awesome!  And if it gets to be too much, tell her to stop and if she doesn't...  Well, you can tell the police you're being harassed, maybe?  If this isn't a realistic option (to get some form of restraining order/court-appointed non-contact), then pardon my ignorance...  But maybe in the future, fuck curiosity and start a fire and toss every letter in before even opening them.  Curiosity can be overwhelming, but...  seriously, burning pieces of paper that cause pain is literally one of the most cathartic things I've done in my life."

offmychest,fd7hhmn,t3_ek6u5r,1578204590.0,"You're amazing for trying to support others despite all of the pain and hardship you're facing right now, OP.  You don't have to be everybody else's rock all the time - you're doing great, getting out there, and killing it.  But thank you. :) This was nice to see...  And if you need anything, let me know!  This is one of my favorite subs thanks to people like you."
PublicFreakout,fcucfrm,t1_fctlskx,1577977713.0,Why are they booing him? He's right.

ChoosingBeggars,fcm4to6,t1_fcm458l,1577764262.0,That was wholesome and kind. Take an upvote.
sadcringe,fbao2z2,t1_fbanzmw,1576682975.0,That's fair. But when a whole group does it?
