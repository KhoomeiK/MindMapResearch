AskReddit,ffwnd4l,t1_ffvgg1a,1580306213.0,"I see what you're saying, but realistically, I don't think most peoples brains work in a way where they can remember absolutely everything they've learned.

For instance, I'm a conceptual learner; I'm very good at looking at the ""big picture"" or the ""underlying theme"" when it comes to learning. I've always been an A/B student and enjoyed learning/reading. I can tell you the gist of the events leading to WWII, who was involved, etc. But if you were to quiz me on it now, asking about specific dates/names, etc, I wouldn't be able to recall if my life depended on it.

I'm currently in law school and I'm still the same way. I wouldn't consider myself a dumbass for not remembering the differences between plant / animal cells or any of the other objectively remedial things we were taught during grade school."

Specifically, I think schools should focus on encouraging and coaching our youth to really help them identify what they are truly good at, and help them figure out what they want to do for their rest of their lives, and help guide them on how to get there practically, instead of just shoving ""go to college"" down our throats."

AskReddit,ffwk778,t1_ffvrd70,1580303645.0,"Fun Fact: My doctor is the brother in-law of the attorney who started that whole mesothelioma ad campaign. Evidently most asbestos companies filed for bankruptcy many years prior in order to evade an initial flood of lawsuits and for a long while mesothelioma personal injury claims were considered the ""bottom of the barrel"" law suits, considering there was little to no money to pursue. Long story short, he found another avenue or some sort of loophole and created the iconic ad that is now forever ingrained into our subconscious. Apparently the dude is freaking loaded from it.

cats,ffqz9x4,t1_ff4v3ix,1580146987.0,"I just want to clarify that I 10/10 do not recommend what I did. 

It was 100% adrenaline-fueled panic and the only reason I risked going back in is because 90% of the fire had been extinguished and I knew there was a strong chance I could make it as long as I kept low and avoided the smoke. It truly was the dumbest (but most rewarding) thing I have ever done. 

Also cats + fire alarms + buckets of water + smoke = A VERY panicked cat on your hands. I have a very trusting relationship with my cat, and he still ended up permanently scaring me. (I have deep scratch mark scars on my stomach and shoulder). 

I just wanted to share my story because I know that fear - and I know the pain I felt thinking I was going to lose Lupe was unbearable. Hands down one of the scariest moments of my life. 

Also one of the most infuriating moments of my life, because my roommate was a irresponsible idiot slob who left a pot of oil on the stove on high for HOURS after frying chicken. Good times."
cats,ffqye1o,t1_ff6b1bw,1580146424.0,"Everyone talks about how they would react in emergency situations, but when it actually happens and you're juggling a flood of adrenaline and fear and time is racing against you, you can only do so much. Please don't weigh yourself with ""could have"" thoughts. 

There is no ""right thing"" in those kind of situations - Objectively, I did the exact thing I wasn't supposed to do to BUNCHES of people. I was very fortunate I lived in a small apartment and that he was the only family member I had to worry about. 

Going back for Lupe was the dumbest thing I have ever done, I'm just lucky I only have a few scars to show from it and that I did not lose my life."
cats,ff3g7th,t3_ere8ga,1579540400.0,"My roommate in college accidentally set fire to my apartment one day. Fortunately I was home sick for work and we were able to put the majority of the fire out with an extinguisher, but the whole apartment was filled with unbearable smoke almost immediately after. Instead of running out of the building, I went back into our apartment for my cat, Lupe. (He too was a high anxiety cat, and I knew he wouldn't make a run for it.) I found him nearly unconscious in my closet, grabbed him, and held him as tight as I could as I ducked under the smoke and fumes and ran out of the apartment. I still have scars on my body from it, but it was worth it. He almost died from the smoke, but we both made it through.  

I know going through a fire is terrifying, and losing family members is even worse. My heart hurts for you. If you need someone to talk to who understands, I am here. Please feel free to message me <3"

CPTSD,fbc4g14,t1_faa2gtf,1576715420.0,"I'm so sorry for the delayed response. 
Naturally this all blew up in the midst of finals and I needed to disappear for a while. 

It's both sad and comforting knowing someone else has been through this. Sad, because I would never wish this upon anyone else, but comforting, because I know that there's someone out there who is pushing through to live their life the best they can, despite the dogshit we're being put through. 

I've come to the understanding that my mom is very ill, along with my sister who almost immediately took up arms against me after hearing the news. I know they were both abused. 

My brothers who are torn / confused I know it's because this is quite simply something that none of us would have ever imagined happening... especially the extent of my mothers lying. 

I've come to peace with the fact that I may not ever have a relationship with my mother or my sister again, but having the awkward weight of being considered a liar or fucking crazy any time I interact with my brothers is really affecting me. I feel like the responsibility of this situation has once again been placed on my shoulders and I don't know if I can handle it. 

I don't know if I should just walk away from my family entirely at this point (aside from my father) and just wait for the truth to come out."
