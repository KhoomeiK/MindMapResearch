raspberry_pi,fgnykr1,t3_ezi718,1580955745.0,Yeah so why did you use telnet instead of ssh...?
SwordOrSheath,fgljktu,t3_ez1bw6,1580901005.0,This is one of the more truly ambiguous ones one here
todayilearned,fginpo8,t1_fgilgk1,1580826689.0,I already addressed that that is a separate case
RoleReversal,fgihrg3,t3_eyi1fe,1580822017.0,I wouldn't really call this RR but it is cute
SwordOrSheath,fgiho1t,t1_fgieo0c,1580821936.0,Way to stereotype
gaming,fgifwv2,t1_fgidfp9,1580820353.0,"That shit was a badge of honor. Back in the OG Counterstrike days my brother was legit. He would intentionally use the shittiest weapons   just for fun.

I remember one match this guy was trying to toast him.

Asshole: ""You're probably a virgin and still live with your mom""

Chad younger brother: ""Your right. I'm 12 and beating you"""
todayilearned,fgieb6m,t1_fgibkty,1580818765.0,"Except you didn't because that isn't how math works? I mean if they jack up the price first and then give you a ""discount"" on a jacked up price that's something else. How is 50% off of two phones not a discount."
todayilearned,fgib9ol,t1_fgi77op,1580815164.0,So you bought two phones at 50% then? I mean it's still a significant discount......
todayilearned,fgib6a8,t1_fgi898j,1580815037.0,This is even more common outside of North America/Europe. A large percentage of the world still can't justify spending money on a PC and/or conventional internet service is shit. But phone service is ubiquitous pretty much everywhere in the world at this point.

raspberry_pi,fg3ybc5,t1_fg3xp03,1580492259.0,Security reasons
guns,fg3wfpi,t3_ewi358,1580491128.0,I don't really get the point of magnum revolvers with such short barrels. A large percentage of the powder goes unburnt which seems like it defeats the purpose of such a high powered round.
liberalgunowners,fg3bf3d,t3_ewa3r4,1580476975.0,I would try and strip their strawman away. White supremacists and racist assholes aren't the ones who are truly concerned about gun rights.
RoleReversal,ffuos7b,t3_ev41hw,1580246415.0,"Even better, check out the face on the dude in the back with the bannana"
Firearms,ffq3rgq,t3_euee5h,1580118822.0,"I read that as one thing since there's no ""and"". Like these are guns that shoot tobacco liquor."
todayilearned,ffg7s6l,t1_fffx27u,1579900299.0,I mean your already racing a person vs a horse. You can't be too exact here
Firearms,fffile5,t1_ffeyb0h,1579884747.0,"I don't think pointing to royalty is an especially good idea. They made a lot of incredibly poor decisions and often acted like children well into later life.

I don't think apprenticeships really made anyone mature either. They just provided for a marketable skill. You needed a marketable skill earlier in life because of both society expected it, and it was just nessesary for survival. Life was harder and people were expected to start work earlier.

I just don't think that really proves anything about actual personal maturity."
Firearms,ffewv3o,t1_ffew6xz,1579868794.0,"I disagree with your assessment of ""allowing our children to be children too long"" kind of thing. Brain development is what it is and it has nothing to do with upbringing. 

The other part I completely agree with though. There shouldn't be two opposed legal definitions of adulthood. Legally you should be considered an adult or not. I just think it's exploitative that the government can send you to war and also not honor your right to bear arms."
Firearms,ffewpi6,t1_ffew9br,1579868634.0,Pretty much my point. You shouldn't be able to be drafted and also unable to fully exercise a constitutional right
ATBGE,ffew39k,t1_ffeuisx,1579867975.0,Exactly. Strawman argument
Firearms,ffepvtw,t3_esyhpd,1579859523.0,The BHP was really his landmark pistol and the 1911 never really worked out exactly like he hoped anyways. Come fight me boomers.

techwearclothing,ffbmwsw,t1_ffbbeya,1579773346.0,It's pretty unfortunate that the Nazis had such good looking uniforms tbh.

Pauper,fejdiik,t1_feiobw5,1579168703.0,"The thing about storm or other combo decks that actually win is that the game gets to end and you get to move on with your life to the next game/thing.

Fog Tron laughs at your decks attempt to win and then spits in your face by making you stick around to watch it kill you in slow agony. It doesn't want to win it just wants to not lose."
gaming,feh5bfi,t3_ep0vqg,1579109450.0,"It always amazes me that Geralt hates portals so much that he would literally take several days of travel over instantaneous travel.

Real world equivalent would be like driving from San Francisco to New York because you have an irrational fear of flying."
patientgamers,fdnmsq0,t1_fdlg537,1578589057.0,"My two biggest complaints are the ""arena"" shooter gameplay aspect, which is a personal preference, and the way they completely wasted the boys of silence as an enemy type. But holy crap. When you get Songbirds code tune and get to use it? Holy shit. One of my top ""spine tingle"" moments in gaming. There are few things that I can compare to watching Songbird rip through a zepplin as a living weapon."
magicTCG,fcz7sze,t3_ejldpl,1578095404.0,"The wording on the second section seems weird, and certainly not like previous cards. Is it x from all graveyards? Is it x number total among any number of graveyards?"
