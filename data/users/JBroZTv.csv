AskReddit,fe6cjat,t1_fdzmnfh,1578886979.0,Exactly! When writer's hear you have to make your character's flawed in ways that don't correctly correlate with the real world they make them dumbasses with no common sense. Bravo üëèüëèüëè to a true intellectual.
AskReddit,fe6c2po,t1_fdzm0x0,1578886634.0,It's starting to annoy me that there's littarly a love interest for everything. The second you see the opposite sex walk into the room that isn't the protagonist's close friend or family you know what's happening.
depression,fcpwflf,t3_ei9s4u,1577873612.0,"No your not a failure, far from it. I am sorry to hear about your situation It's just unfair. Don't let depression consume you please, I know you might think it's acceptable to just feel sorry for yourself & do nothing. But the longer you wait the more painful & vulnerable you become. Save yourself."
depression,fcpvaj5,t3_eifvc0,1577872894.0,"I understand where your coming from.
I've felt like shit for so long through out my time being in a depressed state, I've had so many different outlooks on life. Some optimistic others negative, but I feel like I've come full circle and anything else I say to myself at this point will just be on repeat. I wanna do something different for once even I don't have any true motive behind it."

CODZombies,fco4s9j,t3_ehor9k,1577824074.0,"I'm pretty sure it was because... well you know,
But also probably because we moved on from just Nazi's
& since Chronicles sorta seemed like the end it would be more wholesome to just call it Call of Duty Zombies"
CODZombies,fco47y7,t1_fcniu1e,1577823770.0,"I think you can only have up to 12 players in a custom match in Blackout. Also it still covers the three main crews Ultimis, Primis & Victis"
