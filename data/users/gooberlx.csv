Denver,ff5g259,t3_er8ln9,1579591297.0,"I have a family member who had a ""break"" of sorts. Combination of a several days long manic episode (bi-polar), exacerbated by cocaine. They also have a seizure disorder triggered by physical and mental exhaustion. Petit mal seizures can look like a person zoned out; like they're just gone for a minute. Thousand yard stare and all that.

Honestly, I'm surprised the ER didn't place a 72-hour hold, or at least admit and medicate. (Or did they?) My family member was placed on a hold and medicated through the mania. Followed up with help over at the depression center at University, but if you’re all on Kaiser it’ll likely have to be through their system."
hiking,ff5ajvf,t1_ff4g2tf,1579585288.0,"Rescue insurance exists, but isn’t a common thing in the US. Unless you’re breaking the law or doing something egregiously dumb, SAR isn’t generally charged to those needing rescue, as it might discourage people from calling for help. Fishing and hunting licenses do help to pay for rescue services (probably inadequately). 

It’s more likely your regular medical insurance would cover the cost of your medevac."
coloradohikers,fepjiv6,t1_fen2jka,1579322124.0,"I was gonna say there are dispersed sites right at treeline on the way up South Mt Elbert trail. But, no water that I remember, so you'll have to be a camel."
14ers,fepiqcl,t1_fenma52,1579321538.0,"In addition to those mentioned, there's also [Colorado Trail Explorer (COTREX)](https://trails.colorado.gov), which is released by Colorado Parks and Wildlife. It's pretty good."
Ultralight,fdsmbrj,t3_emzdj9,1578705068.0,"I guessed right on each one. IMO, the Fuji is clearly the better picture, even on mobile. There seems to be greater depth in tonality, and of course Fuji’s color science is famously good.

That being said, especially when shooting RAW, the latest generation phones produce fantastic images. They don’t compete, yet, on resolution, dynamic range or flexibility; but they’re more then adequate for most people.

Nowadays if I’m just dayhiking and taking snaps for Facebook or whatever, my phone will do. Otherwise I bring my Pentax for more serious endeavors."
photography,fdfv1ik,t1_fdcce7o,1578370961.0,"I’ll chime in. The weathersealing on my K7 and K3 kits are reliable and tough as nails, and have saved my bacon more than once. I have absolutely no concerns about shooting in extreme in conditions. The unique features (i.e Astrotracer) and IQ are a generally great value relative to the rest of the market. The ergonomics and hand feel are fantastic, if heavy.

All that said, Fuji is today what Pentax should have been, IMO, in the APSC format. Pentax hasn’t done anything substantially interesting in years. There’s essentially no third party lens support. They stubbornly refuse to even consider mirrorless, according to interviews and statements. It’s a stale brand with so little market anymore, I honestly don’t know if they’re going to survive and simply can’t recommend them for that reason."
dogs,fc64l1o,t1_fc64fh4,1577472134.0,"Yeah my buddy says they don’t cover GSDs at 90% anymore, so the best he could enroll at was 80% for his new puppy. My girl is grandfathered in then...and I ain’t changing a thing with her policy. They’ve been amazing for us."
dogs,fc6187a,t1_fc5iytd,1577469976.0,"I wasn't aware that Healthy Paws did coverage limits, either lifetime or annual. My policy with them doesn't, but then I suppose options may have changed since I enrolled my animals."
dogs,fc5zmbz,t3_egbn40,1577469107.0,"I think you have it right. You should have reliable funds for typical needs, routine vet stuff, and some emergencies. The concept need not apply to catastrophic emergencies that would cause crippling financial hardship.

That said, nowadays one might consider pet insurance to be one of those basic needs. I do, depending on the breed and lifestyle."
Denver,fc0ccy8,t1_fbzuiov,1577286739.0,Oh didn’t realize. Their website apparently doesn’t list their holiday hours.
Denver,fbzjwtl,t3_efbwk6,1577249190.0,"Doubtful. However, King Soopers sells a holiday kit of a whole Boar's Head Sweet Slicing Ham with a brown sugar & spice glaze for $30 or so. It's pretty awesome. Also doubtful it's in stock at this point, but at least they're open so it's worth looking/calling."
Colorado,fbhj3c7,t1_fbhi5qn,1576874865.0,Best $30 ever spent on Amazon.
