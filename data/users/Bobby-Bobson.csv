And even with these new classes of drugs trickling out - the GABA inhibitors, Xyrem, prohistamines - there’s still plenty of other options that just don’t exist yet. For instance: why use noncompetitive GABA inhibitors when you can use competitive ones (which exist but aren’t used for IH)? What about developing a medicine that attacks the amino acids which are precursors to GABA?

I really wonder if along the GABA theory, that since GABA is formed from proteins, and proteins are developed based on DNA instructions, if the whole thing is caused based on a DNA mutation. Besides for being enough to knock “idiopathic” off the title, that would potentially open the door to gene therapy options. And so on and so on."

If you meant the protons, neutrons, and electrons which make up my body, I’m not sure that’s accurate necessarily either. After all, electrons might be newer having been formed out of positions, or perhaps the neutrons are newer, having been formed from electron capture.

Take carbonate as an example, (CO3)2-. It’s an anion with a 2- charge. If you add a single protium ion to it, you get (HCO3)- which we call hydrogen carbonate in older nomenclature. If you add a second hydrogen, you’ll end up with a neutral compound, which we call carbonic acid. Similarly for phosphate, (PO4)3-, where (HPO4)2- is hydrogen phosphate, (H2PO4)- is dihydrogen phosphate, and H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. 

TLDR you’d be right that it’s hydrogen hydroxide if it remained an ion after you added the hydrogen. Since it’s neutral at that point it would be hydroxic acid, but none of this matters because it’s not an ionic compound and therefore follows a completely different set of nomenclature rules."
