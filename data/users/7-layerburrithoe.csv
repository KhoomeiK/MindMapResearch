offmychest,fetmud3,t1_fesu6oh,1579376985.0,">I think in our modern world, pregnancy and childbirth are no longer seen as particularly dangerous, 

It's still highly dangerous lol."

AskReddit,feou5om,t1_feotru0,1579305574.0,Aye thanks dude (I'm a woman btw lmao forgot to mention that)
CasualConversation,feoqnzm,t1_feomxem,1579304092.0,"Well my first goal is $500, just to start out. Once I have that, I'll be good. It's just *getting* that $500, you know?"
AskReddit,feoqjny,t1_feolvtn,1579304020.0,"I've only ever has like 2 serious girlfriends, any other girl was a fwb. I was a wild child for sure lol but I'm 23 now and I'm a lot more mature. I'm done with the fuckin around, you know?"
AskReddit,feoprpc,t3_eq7ib4,1579303657.0,"Stop allowing everyday citizens to own guns powerful enough to kill 30 people in 10 seconds. Powerful guns like that should only be left to military personnel. Handguns are enough for anyone, and there's a way wider variety. If one needs an AR-15 to defend their home or to look badass, then they suck, sorry not sorry lol.

Also, make selling guns only legal in gun shops with actual authorized people with licenses and experience. Gun shows are iffy because authorized people do sell in them, but they need to be more controlled. Stop selling guns in stores like Walmart, guns don't belong in fucking family grocery stores. Sporting goods stores need to get rid of their gun sections (killing animals for fun isn't a sport, in my opinion. It's demented, but that's irrelevant). 

We should also remind people that this won't 100% stop mass shootings. We know this. Criminals are smart, they find a way around shit. But it shouldn't be easy for them anymore. The selling/buying of firearms in this country is too fucking easy and it's leaving an open opportunity for psychos to take advantage of it."
AskReddit,feom9x7,t3_eq7mpw,1579302042.0,"I have a problem with overthinking a lot. Sometimes it's too the point where I start crying. So one day I took a piece of paper and wrote ""You're just overthinking again, that's all this is. You'll be okay in an hour, just breathe,"" and taped it to my dresser next to my bed. It has helped tremendously.

Edit: corrections"

AskReddit,feoid75,t3_eq1wzh,1579300562.0,To have enough saved up for e-com.
offmychest,feo7jkn,t3_eq0mo8,1579296226.0,This is why I came to the conclusion to stop looking for anything and do it my damn self. You can only get rejected so many times before you've had enough. Relying on other people to give you income is the biggest gimmick that society has taught for millennia.
offmychest,fem1qcc,t1_felkb24,1579236912.0,"Okay, come back to me when you're less emotional."
offmychest,felewt0,t1_fekk3ah,1579220560.0,"Yeah, I didn't expect you to get it lol. 

Women pressure each other to do things because they've been told from a young age that that's how they should look. They get it from the media, tv, ads, corporations, etc *which are mostly run by men*. Men have told women for *millennia* that we need to look a certain way to be deemed as desirable for them, and plastic surgery tops the cake of that. 

Usually, men just take whatever comes at them because they're simple-minded while women know their worth and demand that worth be matched with gifts."
offmychest,feki48e,t1_feke84n,1579200518.0,"Let me map it out:

Society (mostly men): Women need to be slim and small and sexy and shaved and they need to be beautiful more than valuable, they need to be attractive.

Women: \*fall for it and start worrying about our looks\*

Society (mostly men): Lol idk why women are so concerned with their looks."
offmychest,fekhuw2,t3_epjh3s,1579200363.0,"It's not the fact that we need to love ourselves more, it's the fact that these industries need to stop selling us the idea that our natural bodies are something to be tucked and tweezed and slimmed. If these industries (mostly dominated by men), stopped telling us these things, we *would* love ourselves more. That's why they're existing because they profit off of the hatred of our bodies. Women telling each other to love our bodies in such an industry-driven society does nothing if we're not actively working to dismantle it."
offmychest,fekgrfp,t3_epf0mc,1579199714.0,"You were never selfish for being suicidal. It's great that this experience changed you in a positive way and I'm glad you're able to get some breath, but you were never selfish for feeling certain ways."
AskReddit,fe9je9n,t1_fe6lf52,1578938132.0,That's because those people do it the easy way and don't want to research suppliers in their own country. Doing it in your own country saves money and stress you don't need.
AskReddit,fe9j9v2,t1_fe6mbvp,1578938057.0,"Some drop shippers do it, but there are subscriptions you can pay for like Spocket that connects you with wholesale suppliers in your own country."

AskReddit,fe4kaiq,t3_enmbd3,1578860213.0,"I would evolve the reproductive systems and genes in women with the ability to reproduce without sperm, only at will. No more birth control, no more condoms, the child will 100% be genetically yours only (instead of 50/50) and 100% wanted each time."
AskReddit,fe4dg9l,t3_enmbuf,1578858091.0,"Dropshipping. It's basically where you work with suppliers directly and put their shit in your online store for a higher price and when a customer orders something from you, you transfer it to the supplier and they ship it directly to the customer. It's really just a form of order fulfillment where you act as the middleman and pocket the profit. There are people out there who make 7 figures doing this. People say it sounds illegal all the time, but there's an element of dropshipping in almost everything you buy."
