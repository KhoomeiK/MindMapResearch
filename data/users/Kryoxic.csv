oddlysatisfying,fdd9w1w,t1_fdcxmeo,1578301671.0,"With a sharp knife and good technique, it's almost impossible to cut yourself, I'd say. 

It's been drilled into me I'm every kitchen I've worked in to always be using the pinch grip and claw. Now I can easily do all my prep work not even have to look at whatever I'm cutting. 

The only time I've cut myself within the past several years is when I was sleep deprived, going into my 3rd 14 hour shift in a row and letting my technique go."
oddlysatisfying,fdd9n57,t1_fdd4160,1578301304.0,"Yup. I specifically only use Japanese knives with my most expensive one being about ~130 ish because they're made with a harder steel that holds an edge longer. 

Not sure about meat packing plants, but I know most house knives in the commercial kitchens I've worked in have been European or American made, so softer steels, but because they see so much use are sharpened very frequently. This is the balance kitchens usually strike: buy semi decent house knives but send them off to get sharpened/replaced every few days/week."
college,fc19fmj,t1_fc18y78,1577312066.0,"I don't see your point. Most financial aid comes in two forms: grants or loans. With grants, yes, they are heavily subsidized by the taxpayer, but they're still grants. The recipient is free to do with that award however they please because that's simply what a grant implies. And guess what? That student regardless of whether they even graduate or not will most likely end up paying taxes of their own eventually right? 

And then with loans, even federally subsidized, they have to repair back anyways. So really in either case I see it as a non-issue. 

By your logic, if I pay for my own CS degree in full by myself, then why can't I keep my six figure salary to myself in the future instead of paying the taxes that I didn't use for my education? Sure, I'll opt out any day."
college,fc16ufg,t1_fc14vss,1577309931.0,"Why do we have to measure the success of a particular course anyways? Why not measure the success of the institute in terms of the quality of the graduates when they go into their respective industries?

No interviewer has ever cared how I did in freshman chemistry (of which I made an A without ever attending a lecture because the professor wasn't as effective as just reading the book. Guess what his evaluation was regardless of my grade). They have, however, tested me on relevant industry skills like data structures and algorithms - on true mastery over them instead of asking for my grade in their respective classes.

>What you're describing is entertainment, not education

What I'm describing is giving the freedom for adults to select what they want to specialize in and freedom to do with their time what they must/will. I can almost guarantee that I'd be more productive getting assignments done rather than being forced to begrudgingly counting the seconds down until I can leave. 

And yes, part of it is time management. But I'm sure many out there would like the option to also forego a couple lectures in order put more time into another class they're struggling with."
college,fc1423w,t1_fc13804,1577307659.0,"I'd argue that measuring success based solely off of how many people pass a course is a pretty bad way to go about it. Forcing people to attend a class they're not particularly interested might just breed resentment and they might even retain less than if they were left alone to do their own thing.

The best courses I've ever taken didn't even care about attendance. They'd rather have focused on true mastery of the material through well made assessments that didn't just rely on regurgitation. 

One example of where using solely grades might backfire is a Statistics class I just took. The professor was actually forced to deflate our grades because we did too well on the first exam and the rest of the semester was hell because of it for seemingly no reason other than the Math department wanted to ""look harder"""
college,fc0j2cx,t1_fc0hzo4,1577291935.0,"Or, ya know, not care? The tuition and fees have already been paid and these people are grown ass adults. If they choose not to attend for whatever reason and still manage to show up to exams and make the grade, why even care?"
Unexpected,fbr9lns,t1_fbr7lzk,1577040765.0,"Yeah, give it a try. If it starts to hurt, then obviously stop. Though arching your back in a horizontal press shouldn't place as much stress on your lumbar and thoracic spine as much as your cervical spine since that's gonna be the section that'll be primarily flexed throughout the ROM. It also serves the purpose of placing your shoulders in a biomechanically better position by moving your shoulder joints a bit closer to the point of your chest where you're touching the bar so you won't have to worry about your elbows as much.

If you look up pictures of how powerlifters set up during the bench, it'll give you a better idea of how it should look.

Good luck in your training!"
