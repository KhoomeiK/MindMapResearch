AskReddit,fguk46y,t1_fguilr1,1581122795.0,"Yeah, forgot to mention this doesn’t work with people who LOOK for stuff to complain about. 

Then you’re just buying into their game lol."
AskReddit,fgud8pf,t3_f09sex,1581117982.0,"Whininess. Not helplessness, just someone who can do anything they have to but wants to whine a bit first. 

My wife whines all the time. Or complains, synonyms and all that. 

It always gives me a really obvious chance to do nice stuff for her and get brownie points. Really takes any guesswork out of anticipating 90% of her needs. Bad day at work? She’s called me during the 20 minute drive home, I’ve got a hot bath and towels in the drier ready. Started her period? Check it, I’ve got chocolates on standby and have ordered pizza. 

People think of whiners and complainers as annoying, or useless. But I just think of it as an instruction manual to that persons happiness."
books,fgu0lib,t1_fgty7z0,1581111811.0,"I haven’t, and I have to admit that sounds a bit farther out there than anything I’ve ever read, but what else is reading for but a good expanding of boundaries! 

I’ll check it out as soon as I can."
Portland,fgt3p03,t1_fgt1038,1581098388.0,"Lmao thank you, I do have a nice beard! I’m personable and will not bite over belly rubs so I have that over cats."
books,fgt3lsk,t1_fgt2mty,1581098337.0,"The author wrote two other books I think, set in the same universe but not direct sequels or anything, you can read any of them in any order. 

If you’re looking for more female protagonists, I recommend the Mistborn series. 

I know one of the biggest issues with men writing women is how...delusional some authors are about what women think/do, and I think Mr. Sanderson avoids a lot of the pitfalls that men fall into. There’s absolutely zero references to heaving breasts, tingly feelings in people’s nethers, or damsels who can’t help but love the bad boy. 

That being said, romance is a big part of the books, and if you’re not interested in seeing a woman worry over her husband, or her feelings, you’ll probably want to skip them unfortunately. It’s not overwhelming or detrimental to who the protagonist is, in my opinion, but fair warning regardless."
Portland,fgt3427,t1_fgt1m2s,1581098045.0,"Thank you, I’ll take a look anyway, won’t know what’s out there if I don’t try!"
Portland,fgt31dl,t1_fgt1dy0,1581098001.0,"Unfortunately, the only work I’ve ever done has been as a medic. So I can’t exactly use those skills without college/certification. 

Other than that, I’m all soft skills, like communication, leadership, time management, etc."

MovieSuggestions,fgsrkvl,t1_fgsr8iy,1581091156.0,"This is true. One of my favorites, even if it’s a bit cheesy and hamfisted."
nextfuckinglevel,fgspl56,t1_fgsofnt,1581089919.0,"Yeah, but you can’t just soap and water an animals bite normally, was my concern. Are snakes any different, or are they normally treated with antibiotics as a preventive measure?"
nextfuckinglevel,fgso6pv,t1_fgsi3gb,1581089034.0,"Shouldn’t they be really prone to infection, snake bites? I’ve never been in an area with them being common so I’m not sure, but cat bites and dog bites are so dangerous because their teeth deposit some gnarly bacteria in the wounds, and we can’t close the surface up to heal or else risk leaving that infection to fester in the dark. 

Do snakes have cleaner mouths or something?"

books,fgsegrl,t3_f07ko8,1581082075.0,"Ahh yeah interstellar pig was a fun one, there were at least a few books in that little series I think. 

Good times. 

There was another book, umm....Heir Apparent? Which was the first book I ever read with a girl for a protagonist. 

That one was sort of a sci fi RPG setting of a girl playing a VR medieval RPG lol. Good fun mostly."

AskMen,fgs84fl,t1_fgrykk9,1581075959.0,Oh yeah! I have an urban decay membership and preorder all the palettes or buy them day one if I have to so she can always play with the new ones.
houston,fgrfma4,t1_fgqgdhr,1581045621.0,"Isn’t that what all the cop loving conservatives say? 

Just be respectful, just do as they ask, don’t make yourself a threat, blah blah blah."
houston,fgrf19u,t1_fgqdh8p,1581045219.0,Is that an option here? Because I definitely vote that if I have a choice.
PublicFreakout,fgr5bm3,t1_fgr4wm4,1581038524.0,"Not a clue either. And training is vastly different from the fleet, and different work environments vary in terms of level of professionalism too. Working 12 hour shifts in an ER leads to a lot more familiarity than working 8 in family practice, for an example of my own experience."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fgqxesp,t1_fgqx6df,1581033513.0,"I’d say it’s pretty inevitable for any non-conservative moderated sub to eventually turn mostly if not entirely left leaning, considering Reddit’s user base."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fgqucq6,t1_fgqk7kp,1581031675.0,"I don’t think it started out quite so biased, but I was only like 14 or something when I started browsing reddit and wasn’t even gonna pretend to give a fuck about anything but boobs and vidya games."
AskMen,fgqq7bd,t1_fgqi2nz,1581029173.0,"Yep my advice is always the same. Make distance between yourself and that girl if you can’t instantly lose any infatuation you have for her. I’ve embarrassed and made a creep of myself too many times to say it any other way, if you can’t turn it off like a switch, you need to make real distance between you two. Because everything will be going well, y’all will be friendly, but the whole time she’s noticing you’re not just being nice, you’re lingering on hugs, or messaging her too much or too early or too fast, and all it’s doing is making her uncomfortable. 

Then you’ll get drunk or something and really slip up. 

This is how the nice guy meme was born, guys not being able to just say no to their own infatuation."
AskMen,fgqpv58,t1_fgpqxgc,1581028976.0,"Bruh 20% of men is an insane amount of guys to have to be afraid of. 

Honestly, think about that. A woman on tinder for an hour could easily get 100 matches. 20 of them are alarmingly creepy, furious, hateful, or otherwise upsetting to turn away. 

That’s TERRIFYING. I have had maybeeee two women in my life I was genuinely afraid of their responses to rejection. Just two. And I wouldn’t willingly sign up to turn down a third. 

And women have to deal with one out of every five guys they meet like that? Even if that’s a wild overestimation, it’s still exhausting to contemplate."
PublicFreakout,fgqnt83,t1_fgq00mm,1581027780.0,"Yeah no names. Once they liked us (the last week, basically) we called them ST2 or CS1 or whatever, but never any names."
