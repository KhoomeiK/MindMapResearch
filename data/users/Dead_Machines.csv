AskReddit,fer9ppt,t3_eq3ap4,1579351487.0,Country. The nasally voices and not so proper annunciation of certain vowels makes me cringe and want to jump off a bloody bridge. I'm fairly convinced that everyone who says they enjoy country are only lying to themselves.

DragonsDogma,fc9z5dz,t1_fc91t6b,1577560383.0,I'd love some fleshed out lore on the being that takes you when you step in the water. That's always been the biggest mystery for me outside of the lore on neighboring countries
FortniteCompetitive,fbyzabe,t1_fbxyep3,1577230450.0,"The irony of posting this on a competitive subreddit post about being told a specific amount and getting less than the amount told is astounding. It's all about the principle, my dude."
