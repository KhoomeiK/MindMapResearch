AnimalCrossing,fft1sfj,t1_ffsyp0p,1580202464.0,"It's not *that* expensive if you just want to to try it out. Last I checked, some small rods and reels got for $25ish together, a small pack of lures for $5-12, and a fishing license in Texas for a week is $11 last time I got one. It probably varies from state to state, but in my experience you can get all these things at most Walmarts, Academy's, most big sporting goods stores. If you want higher success I recommend live bait. Like any other hobby, 1) do your research, it will save you a lot of headache and 2) it can get expensive once you're hooked(eh? EH?? Eyyyy). For areas you can fish, make sure it's not private, but I've never had to pay for a fishing spot unless I was camping. I'm sure whatever national park or public space will have info if fishing is allowed or not, most will require a fishing license (this goes to support conservation of these natural areas, so it's worth getting even if you wanna just try it once). Overall, for $50 you could come out of there with a good time, even just fishing perch off a dock with a buddy."

I also find it hard to understand why people lack passion for food. The American Midwest lacks flavor, so I think for some folks anything spicier than ketchup is too much to handle. Which is really sad, there's so much flavor to experience, and there's such Joy to be found when someone likes your cooking. It's also an extremely useful skill, and you can feed yourself for cheaper and healthier (easier to watch what you're eating if you're the one who handles it) vs eating out all the time or eating only ready made meals.
