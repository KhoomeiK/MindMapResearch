dogs,ffnqlyd,t3_eu972i,1580069431.0,"My rescue dog has a complicated behaviour where she rubs herself on things and rolls around, huffing and puffing for attention, but also flips onto her back in a submissive gesture. What I’ve realised is that she’s trying to initiate interaction while also telling me she’s not a threat. I wondered if she was telling me to leave her alone but she keeps doing it until I pay her some attention with scratches or rubs. 

A blog by Victoria Stillwell stuck with me, all dog body language has to be taken into context with other sounds and actions they’re making at the time, plus the situation they’re in. A single action by itself does rarely tells you the full story.

“Any signal that is demonstrated by a particular part of the dog’s body must always be read in the context of whatever other body or vocal language the dog is communicating. Similar signals have different meanings in different situations, so the position of the body and other vocal signals will help you understand a dog’s intent and emotional state.”

There was a time Virgin was very oversubscribed in North Bristol, it even made the Bristol Post website etc though I can't find it now unfortunately. It went on for months but eventually settled down. Has been rock solid since late 2012.

bristol,fff3tf3,t1_ffeye80,1579874960.0,"Depends how big your house is, how many walls you have, how thick they are, which technology you want to use to repeat the signal elsewhere (if at all), how fast your connection to the premises is, how many devices you've got connecting to it, and what you want to do with it (e.g. port forwarding, VPN, remote management etc)."

holdmyfeedingtube,fdzcvt1,t3_en0xux,1578789043.0,"I used to work with a guy who ripped his hand to pieces by tripping into an industrial machine. Amazingly, one of the factory workers stood near him grabbed the dangling pieces of his hand (it was in a similar state to this, albeit from mangling rather than an explosive) and held the pieces together with his own bare hands, all the way to the hospital. Didn't let up the pressure until the doctors ordered him to. They were able to save and reconstruct the hand ONLY because of these quick actions. Watching this video, with ten of this  dopes mates stood around doing fuck all, makes me mad."

You gave her something absolutely priceless and you should feel proud of that. Nothing will make you feel better about this except time and reflection, but hold onto the fact that you gave a dying dog happiness in her final days and cared enough to discover she was ill and end her suffering rather than prolonging it. You did good."
