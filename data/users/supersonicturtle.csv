Is this the right word) as present. And also the studies done on this topic don't hold the most scientific merit because of small study size. You will also slowly gain a resistance to your own cat just by being constantly exposed to them.

Believe it or not, Sphinx cats are apparently pretty affectionate and chill. A coworker of mine has one and it'll purr when her toddler is grabbing the poor cat's tail, so don't count out these naked babies either :)"

You're right, sumo deadlifts is multijoint and both the hips and the knees move significantly. Also it works the quads and the calves a lot, which I like a lot.

[here](https://www.elitefts.com/education/the-sumo-deadlift-youre-doing-it-the-wrong-way/) is a hella seasoned and experienced coach yelling about proper form for sumo being unknown and regardless, he's right about form.

And [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZdaOoW2F6w) is our goddess Stef Cohen doing three reps of heavy duty, dreamy sumo squats, mostly for looking purposes because I don't think many of us will watch all 37 minutes of this."

But I'm also unsure if a.goverment so opposed to a person not donating their organs will be too impressed with your sneaky will and apologize/pay rétributions for acting upon what was legally permitted until three days after harvesting when the will was read. Unless this is a brand new system, chances are that someone has already tried this and I'd love to see that court case document."
todayilearned,fem0igy,t1_fel83dd,1579235852.0,"Okay but logical thought process- organ harvesting has to occur within a finite and miniscule amount of time after death or else tissue death occurs and the organ is also dead. Meaning that if on paper, in the hospital, a man is a donor, they harvest. 

Then they read the will *after he dies*and people are like ¯\(°_o)/¯, no? Dude is dead, his heart has probably saved a life by then, and it's too late for that body autonomy to kick in. I feel like that kind of will is comparable to a Facebook post ""I hereby deny Facebook the rights to my data"" where you feel super smart doing it and then in reality someone is looking at you going ""well, that's not gonna work buddy""."
todayilearned,felzume,t1_felibmu,1579235296.0,"I actually have a decent response here. My uncle passed away abruptly a few years ago due to an insane stroke. He was a smoker and a partier, so had this been three years earlier it wouldn't have been as shocking. He'd gotten into shape and was pretty healthy, from what I was told.

So. History of alcohol/probably light drugs, definitely a big smoker. Insane heart attack with multiple blocked arteries. My mom asked the nurse what organs had been harvested and was baffled when the lungs had been listed. The nurse's response was essentially that if your lungs are dying and someone else's lungs would have kept them alive and acceptably healthy, then they're an approved donor. Also lungs clean out ""relatively quickly."" 

My entire family is listed as an organ donor even tho one of them is on intravenous medication once every six weeks to keep her healthy. Don't ask. The collective reasoning is that the doctors are smart and will know if they can harvest our organs or not. To silence your fears, they might not take the liver of an alcoholic man, but his lungs, heart, skin, etc? Probably can."
montreal,fdnyqig,t1_fdnln1a,1578595565.0,"I had no idea why MTL drivers bitched about cyclists until I moved to the plateau lmao

Idfk. My opinion is is kind of that every city has its own element of lawlessness in its driving culture. In Montreal, we'll swerve around a parked car that's half in our own lane and change lanes while we're at it- but without using blinkers. We all know what the car in front of us will do in that situation, so it's fine. The problem with cyclists/drivers is that our lawless habits don't match up (stop signs, red lights, left hand turns but on both sides goddamnit) so we hate each other.

I like the idea of a cycling license with a simple exam that would cut down fines on any tickets acquired during cycling by a huge amount. Then simultaneously increase cyclist policing. Offer the cycling exams in schools for kids. Make it easier access to cycling road laws. Etc."
montreal,fdnxj7l,t1_fdnsubb,1578594866.0,I had to go through that intersection on a bike all summer for work and almost died. Nobody's fault- there's so much going on that cars move fast through it. Jesus. It needs lights.

sir: not your bike, shut up. Go buy a nice manly red or black bike and don't forget to do your bicep curls while you're at it."
