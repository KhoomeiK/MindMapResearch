I think I would like to volunteer at food banks or homeless shelters in the future when I'm in a better position to.  I do try to donate to the food banks at least once a year; I've never had to use one, but some months (especially as a student) it was only by the skin of my teeth so I'm mindful of others who weren't as fortunate."

fatlogic,ffgvydl,t1_ffglxjx,1579916444.0,My neighbour's dog was very particular on this point: she'd only have the primo crunchy stuff from the cat's litter box.  Can't argue with intuitive coprophagia.

Three colloquialisms/memes that indicate the same thing in a row, huh? ""How do you do, fellow kids?"""
fatlogic,ffdwkuf,t1_ffdiyos,1579830715.0,"Oh, I'd hate to have a learned taste aversion to blue cheese, since adult me loves it as much as child me did.  In an odd way, I lucked out because I developed a childhood learned taste aversion to chocolate chip cookies after I was given one on a long family trip and became motion sick in the car soon thereafter --- no loss to me though, since I don't really like sweets and was already ""meh"" on anything chocolate and especially chocolate chip cookies. If you have to come to dislike a food in that way, it's good if it's a food you were already not into."
