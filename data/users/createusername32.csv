ShouldIbuythisgame,ffen15w,t3_et7fwq,1579855240.0,"I recommend starting with Blackflag, it was sort of a fresh start after the original trilogy. And from there you can either go back and play the earlier games or go forward with rogue, unity and syndicate. Good game mechanics, good story and characters, the tropical colonies are a beautiful looking setting.  There’s plenty of good stealthy missions, the flintlock pistols are a fun addition to the combat(especially on ships), the naval stuff is a lot of fun, you attack ships and add them to your fleet or use the materials to upgrade your own ship, treasure hunting in the jungle adds a bit of variety and you can also hunt animals to upgrade all your weapons and tools."
