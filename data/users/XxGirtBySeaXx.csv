I'm not a mum but the most accomplished, organised people I know who get things done and stick to a schedule are mums with a career. I thought I had good time management but they leave me in the dust. Everyone has the same amount of time in a day. How you choose to use it is what differentiates you from others."

BeautyGuruChatter,ff86327,t1_ff5qq18,1579667020.0,Whoa. That's just sad. You eat less calories than you expend if you want to lose weight. It's mostly about what you eat. There is no secret to it. Why people make it theatrical and harder than it needs to be is beyond me.

I mostly get vouchers but the 3 that I have received money from are (if you Google them)
- Pure Profile
- Toluna
- Swagbucks

They can take a few weeks to pay out but if you have free time you can do surveys on your phone and it adds up."
Frugal,felgocg,t3_epkfiq,1579221742.0,"I'm still very much on this journey myself but I can share what has helped me so far. I live on my own, also have medical conditions that impact my abilities and fatigue levels so I am balancing full time work, managing my health, being frugal while also trying to make things easier for myself.

I've got into the habit of writing down how much money I spend each day. I can see it via my banking app but when you're sitting down, accounting for everything you spent, it brings things into focus. I look back at it and identify patterns where I can do better. It's a constant process but it's really helped me. On days where I don't need to spend any money, I feel great.

I also have expensive healthcare costs. I suss out different pharmacies as to where I can get my medication less expensively and where I can get my probiotics and supplements. I also have loyalty cards for just about everywhere I shop and collect points. I don't eat fast food anymore. It seems cheap but it really isn't overall. Once a week I cook up a mince+ spice+onion+garlic taco type mix that I refrigerate and use on tacos, on salads, burritos etc for dinner. It's tacos most nights and its delicious lol. On a bad health day it's easy to prepare these meals when the taco mix is already cooked on a good health day.

Depending on what your health conditions require, I've found that focusing on actual meals and cutting out snacking has saved me money. Depending on where you live, buying seasonal fruit can be less expensive than other types of food.

I also do surveys/market research online for extra money and vouchers that I can use for money off groceries. (Pure Profile, Swagbucks ec.) Re: groceries, it is expensive at the time but if you can buy things in bulk, particularly on sale, the long term savings are worth it.

Libraries are amazing, we don't need as much cutlery and kitchen utensils as we think we do, eat before you leave the house or keep food and water in your bag so you don't get tempted to buy food and water on the go, we buy more at the supermarket when we're hungry so try to avoid that, watch how you're using electricity- don't leave lights on, switch appliances off at the wall, don't be afraid to ask for help from public health services, look at how far you've come and go easy on yourself. You're moving on and taking control of your life and that's amazing. Don't forget that."
Frugal,feldoc7,t1_fel6do3,1579219736.0,"This is exactly what I do and the savings have been so worth it. Plus I love the food. I cook up a mince + taco spice + garlic + onion mix once a week and use it for tacos, nachos, in salads, on wraps. Tacos for dinner lots of nights feels like a treat and saves me money."

BeautyGuruChatter,fel3304,t1_feknjlp,1579213004.0,"Yeah, she was so involved in the artwork, design, product names... I need to learn more to be confident that she is entirely separate from the brand now and everything she created while involved.

Honestly, even then its too much proximity to a Nazi and an anti-vaxxer. For me it's safer to just stay away and hope the brand fades into obscurity."

UnresolvedMysteries,fe5v3fx,t1_fdh2zyv,1578875622.0,"Natasha Ryan in Australia has described why she never came forward after running away from home at age 14, to the point where a serial killer was on trial for her murder and she remained hidden. She didn't expect it to cause the fuss it did with all of the police resources and media attention and completely freaked out. Teens run away all the time without us knowing their names and she didn't know that there was a serial killer operating in the area. The police did and they threw everything at her disappearance. She kept waiting for it to calm down and it didn't. And the longer she stayed away, the more she felt like she couldn't come forward. The pressure only increased with time. In the end she didn't come forward voluntarily, she was found at the same time as the trial for her murder was taking place. Even that didn't make her want to come forward. It made the stakes too high in her eyes.

I don't believe Andrew is alive (or free of his own volition if he is) but similar to Natasha's case, his case blew up and became known so widely. It hasn't calmed down. The posters don't go away, we're all still talking about it. The insight from her very unusual circumstances make it easy to understand why the more time that passes, the less likely someone is likely to come forward. She was also charged and found guilty of Causing a False Police Investigation so there's the very real fear that they'll get in trouble. It isn't always that the police just want to know you're okay, especially when they've spent a massive amount of money searching for you."

UnresolvedMysteries,fdp6fa6,t1_fdoywjg,1578621090.0,"Yeah I remember that too. They were worried he'd tried to seek medical treatment under another name or something and they were saying he was last spotted at a medical centre.
I wonder if it objectively looked like him in the footage or whether we see what we desperately want to see in these situations."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdmh6lo,t1_fdma0v7,1578549772.0,"You said it all so perfectly <3
I'm so glad that it spared you but hate that you got that close. May it continue to stay away. It is amazing how united we are when it comes to helping each other out in the worst times. I hope that part can stay. And you can count me in on the protests. As soon as people and animals have what we need, we have to turn our attention to preventing another leader like this letting it happen this way again. Mich love back to you <3"
BeautyGuruChatter,fdm6qex,t1_fdic3nr,1578541156.0,"This is really relatable. I'm in a safe area too and share the same emotions about this horrifying, unending nightmare and frustrations with leadership. I don't have a YouTube channel but posting anything make-upish on my Instagram feels shallow and irrelevant. Being back at work after the Christmas break, it feels good to be solving problems even if they aren't related to the fires and I do what I can to help in my free time, but at the end of the day when I try to go to sleep there's this guilt that I haven't done enough for my country, I'm not giving enough time and money, I spent time on things that don't seem important, my problems shouldn't feel like problems compared to those in the thick of it, I shouldn't laugh or feel happy while there is so much suffering etc. So many people and animals in so many places need help and of course so many of us want to help them all. I've been through 2 natural disasters, one last year, and I know (to a point) what some of it is like for people.

I'm trying to take my lead from Lisa Messenger (not in the make up community, just a great person) on Instagram who is doing so much, more than I can, to help but makes a point of running into the ocean, playing with her dog, having that short window that you need to fill your heart up. Allowing yourself to experience joy fuels you to keep going, otherwise you'll emotionally burn out and can't help anyone.

I'm really glad that Arna shone a light on this.

Much love to everyone in our beautiful country, wherever you are. International community, thank you for caring about us <3"

UnresolvedMysteries,fdj3ncz,t1_fdh1zmj,1578457575.0,"I was following a missing person's case- Daniel O'Keefe- as his posters appeared in my town and there was a reported sighting here (and in many, many places.) 5 years later and he was found in a remote part of a storage area on his family's property (suicide.) Because his family never relented and his sister quit her job and dedicated herself to the search, his poster was all over Australia and a lot of us saw it. It had more to do with outside forces than the police. I see the Andrew posters as people who haven't lost hope rather than some kind of police breakthrough."
