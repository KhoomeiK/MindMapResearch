Try becoming more solution-oriented. The first step is “What can I do to make my situation a little better?” The answer “I don’t know” is not allowed.

Here’s some thoughts:
* Drop some commitments
* Practice negotiation tactics to ask for raises
* Find a social hobby (meetups)
* Start a side gig

Etc.

Just one little crack in the ice is what it takes to get momentum. Don’t ever give up. Don’t ever say stop pushing forward."

ABoringDystopia,fexfgcv,t1_fex9r32,1579430128.0,"Dude fuck that times 10. When considering a job I think people would definitely benefit from looking at the opportunity cost of a job. One hour mandated lunch, and lucky if you can figure out how to use that time to work on your own goals. Just lunch and commute adds an additional 10 hour weekly burden to a person.

That means a $10/hr job pays $400/week (not including taxes). $400/50hrs is $8hr. Subtract transportation costs, and so on.

Remote work has to be the future, especially once most face-to-face service jobs are automated away..."

Things went well, but when I made moves on her back at my house she turned me down. I explained she does not have to sleep with me, but I paid for her airfare and for a weekend trip we had planned in Paris. She could either deal with my dick or I can put her on a train in the morning to make her own way. She took the dick a bunch of times and we had a great trip.
