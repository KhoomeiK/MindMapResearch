>I’m curious why you think someone needs to be gifted and exceptionally intelligent to work in a professional job.

I don't and I didn't say that. I (loosely) said that the degree doesn't make you gifted or exceptionally intelligent. My arguement is that most jobs that ""require"" degrees can be done by someone without one. 

One of my buddies is a great example for this. He's a building inspector employed by the state. It seems to be a decent paying job and he's absolutely an intelligent individual but he didn't need 4 years of college to prepare him for this career. However, if he didn't have a degree he'd be completely ineligible for the position. See the problem?

Which is the root of my objection. A huge chunk of ""children"" are making massive financial decisions for a piece of paper that society thinks is important.
