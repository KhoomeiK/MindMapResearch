Then 9 days later they said they saw the wreckage. years later documents were leaked and it turns out that they knew the whole time  they sent a search party, 8 minutes after it was shot down, and in the 5 days before they acknowledged the shootdown they not only found the plane but they also searched it and stole the black boxes out of it so no data about what happened could be discovered, then when Korea demanded that the U.S. and Japan be the primary search Parties this gave the U.S. legal grounds to actually fire on soviets if they continued to obstruct the search for the plane that the Russians had already found but refused to give the location to. 

During the search the Russians did the following things to obstruct the search

fake light signals, sending an armed boarding party to threaten to board a U.S.-chartered Japanese auxiliary vessel (blocked by U.S. warship interposition), interfering with a helicopter coming off the USS Elliot (Sept. 7), attempted ramming of rigs used by the South Koreans in their quadrant search, hazardous maneuvering of Gavril Sarychev and near-collision with the USS Callaghan (September 15, 18), removing U.S. sonars, setting false pingers in deep international waters, sending Backfire bombers armed with air-to-surface nuclear-armed missiles to threaten U.S. naval units, criss-crossing in front of U.S. combatant vessels (October 26), cutting and attempted cutting of moorings of Japanese auxiliary vessels, particularly Kaiko Maru III, and radar lock-ons by a Soviet Kara-class cruiser, Petropavlovsk, and a Kashin-class destroyer, Odarennyy, targeting U.S. naval ships and the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Douglas Munro (WHEC-724), USS Towers, escorting USS Conserver, experienced all of the above interference and was involved in a near-collision with Odarennyy (September 23–27).

The wreckage was never found by the U.S. or the Japanese.

I honestly dont know how this event didn't spark a war between the U.S. Japan and Korea against Russia."
