Conservative,ffjgiqv,t1_ffj3wf2,1579997763.0,"Agreed. The media needs clicks and likes to survive, and a good way to ensure that is to create a fairy tale one side is the villian and one side is the hero. I don't have to tell you which side is portraying the villian in this story. Fortunately those who don't live on the internet realize there is no good and bad guy regarding politics. Politics are too complex to have a simple concept like good vs. evil. 

Politicians are garbage people, and they have been for a long, long time. Doesn't matter who or what party they represent. The vast majority are bought and paid for by corporations.

But see, it's too easy to pit the people against their leaders. That's almost expected. So they spin a narrative that puts the people against themselves. Puts people into groups based on trivial nonsense like political identification.

I'm honestly not sure when the tipping point was. I feel like I just woke up one day and half the country hated the other half."
