AskReddit,ffg77y9,t3_etbh0h,1579899949.0,These stories all sound awful. I‚Äôm feeling very lucky to have such wonderful parents.
AskReddit,ffg6nht,t1_ffg5i2l,1579899597.0,I know it‚Äôs unrelated but happy cake day
DestinyTheGame,ffdb9yy,t1_ffdb88t,1579817166.0,Oh they do? I didn‚Äôt realise. Do you happen to have a link to where they said that they know?
DestinyTheGame,ffd8pu3,t1_ffd84zt,1579815612.0,Nope it‚Äôs all bugged
DestinyTheGame,ffd7y9m,t1_ffd4vue,1579815172.0,Neither of them drop the lore
DestinyTheGame,ff9lg8r,t1_ff9lce7,1579715482.0,Well let‚Äôs hope they listen.
DestinyTheGame,ff9leeq,t1_ff9l1s2,1579715452.0,"Man I hope so. But it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt even see them. I respect that it won‚Äôt happen overnight I just want to see it change. I personally do have the time to keep up, but if something were to happen that restricts me I would feel pretty left out"
Neverbrokeabone,feux01p,t3_eqis1p,1579390796.0,Good to see milk coloured appropriately. U.K. milk gang
Neverbrokeabone,feuvhi5,t3_eqgzr7,1579390381.0,Bye lamer
DestinyTheGame,feusdav,t1_feunork,1579389464.0,I don‚Äôt think you understood his reply
memes,feurcz3,t3_eqm9a4,1579389231.0,You have become the very thing you swore to destroy
destinycirclejerk,fetlt9w,t1_fetlp0k,1579376716.0,Ye I guess it was. There are circle jerkers everywhere
destiny2,fetlqgc,t3_eqgmcm,1579376691.0,68 is the highest stat role you can have
destiny2,fetkav2,t3_eqfph4,1579376297.0,Fair to say I sent the whole shipment back to Femchurch
destinycirclejerk,fetidzp,t3_eqkoua,1579375748.0,What a coincidence that you screen shotted my tweet and posted it here.
DestinyTheGame,feti6lh,t3_eqkz4c,1579375671.0,That sucks
DestinyTheGame,fen6bqs,t1_fen69te,1579277936.0,Yup the encounter is ruined by this sort of thing
DestinyTheGame,femrpzj,t3_epyy7w,1579267700.0,It‚Äôs not but it would stop a wipe or two that doesn‚Äôt need to happen
DestinyTheGame,femk43j,t3_epyy7w,1579259615.0,We shouldn‚Äôt have to do that
DestinyTheGame,fejn7t4,t3_epcom0,1579180538.0,"Mate, no one cares"
facepalm,fegy6by,t1_fegg6l6,1579105150.0,"Yup I know a loott as well. Religion really has no place in this argument as religious people, well Christians anyway, should know that humans are capable of bad things and should strive to do better. People who default to the religious people fault  argument are no better than the supposed religious people they are trying to blame. I mean I‚Äôm religious but I know that we need to do something about it."
facepalm,fegxwa4,t1_fegr1cx,1579104975.0,K I‚Äôm waiting for an hour to see as well
facepalm,fegxs4u,t1_fegl6sj,1579104903.0,The plastic waste point is true. But there are a lot of idiots who won‚Äôt use lab grown meat and also a lot who hate electric cars because of reason like ‚ÄúBUt TheYRe NoT as FUn tO dRiVE‚Äù
facepalm,fegxkb6,t1_fegwe9v,1579104769.0,Don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs arson attacks because it isn‚Äôt. That is literally fake news and always was. The bushfires this year are bigger than they ever should be. If you honestly think it was arson attacks and not rising temperatures then you are believing stuff that is many times more false than climate change.
facepalm,fegxavd,t1_fegsb86,1579104605.0,The hell do you mean? There is lots of evidence to suggest climate change and we know that temperatures are rising much faster than they naturally would be. If you deny climate change that shows that you don‚Äôt have much consideration for anyone living in more vulnerable places in the world
facepalm,fegx2us,t1_fegsz90,1579104464.0,No we know a lot about it. We know that temperatures rise and fall but never this fast
facepalm,fegwt0n,t3_ep0tk4,1579104288.0,Yup. People are incredibly retarded and should all die
destinycirclejerk,fe9wyoh,t1_fe9v2sr,1578942206.0,Then honestly these people should play a different game
destinycirclejerk,fe99qs2,t3_eo6w4p,1578935631.0,Ye I mean like I know they weren‚Äôt as incredibly detailed and the shaders weren‚Äôt as variable in D1 but still the armour was so much better somehow
destinycirclejerk,fe98afh,t3_eo4wgk,1578935274.0,Or these people could just join a fucking clan
Neverbrokeabone,fdx09jy,t3_emz03x,1578764016.0,Yup you‚Äôre fine
Neverbrokeabone,fdx07t7,t3_emz18i,1578764001.0,When people tell me they don‚Äôt wear helmets because they think it makes them look bad. I break their skulls
destinycirclejerk,fdwdw9h,t1_fdvvcf9,1578757694.0,Yep the post was literally the biggest waste of 30 seconds of my life ever
ShitPostCrusaders,fdvd39c,t3_en336q,1578746195.0,Is this some sort of late nighter joke that I go to bed too early to understand?
destinycirclejerk,fdmp1cn,t3_em28kk,1578558793.0,Woah no way that‚Äôs so cool. If Bungie doesn‚Äôt add this to the game next season then I won‚Äôt buy the pass. It would be a complete waste as the DRIP FEED of content is really making me feel like a have to play little and often instead of playing these amazing *cough* boring raids all the time. Honestly after playing these games for so long. (And then it escalates) at this point I‚Äôve been putting up with this for too long. It‚Äôs time to stop. *shoots themselves*
DestinyTheGame,fdmom8t,t1_fdlalu9,1578558235.0,I‚Äôve never actually watched a twitch stream before. Who is that?
Showerthoughts,fdkyjgy,t3_elr5u6,1578513799.0,Finally a good thought
DestinyTheGame,fdky3jo,t1_fdkxzco,1578513539.0,"Mainly the new exotic quest, the season pass progression and new seal taking less grind for less dedicated players and everything becoming slightly easier for less active players"
DestinyTheGame,fdkxuo4,t1_fdkxtbd,1578513393.0,Thats a good point actually.
memes,fdhydfq,t1_fdhuvh0,1578432409.0,Before my time
memes,fdhevqn,t3_elas3l,1578421177.0,A good example of how when you think you‚Äôve got it weird. Scotland has it weirder
destiny2,fdheljs,t3_ekynj4,1578421004.0,[UPDATE] for anyone that actually cares. I finally did it using all the help that you guys gave me. A prime example of how great this community is
memes,fdh1tec,t3_elas3l,1578413538.0,I wish dude.
lingling40hrs,fdh1qz0,t1_fdh1mrm,1578413495.0,Ye it‚Äôs like once you get past a certain point it becomes much more enjoyable
okbuddyretard,fdh1phr,t3_el8mgc,1578413468.0,Ah what‚Äôs up bro. This is someone from school that you know
lingling40hrs,fdh1h6i,t1_fdh1csg,1578413323.0,That‚Äôs great. I play piano too. I almost quit actually but I‚Äôm glad I stuck with it.

cursedcomments,fdh073b,t3_el76f4,1578412510.0,It sucks that there is so much misinformation surrounding the fires.
destiny2,fdgzaho,t1_fdgz4dq,1578411933.0,I will try that after I scrape through the WHOLE DUNGEON again. If only I had one more day off school to actually learn how this damn encounter works. Thanks for all the advice though
ShitPostCrusaders,fdg9h8q,t3_ekwox3,1578385802.0,SHIIIIIIZAAAAAA
ShitPostCrusaders,fdg9g6t,t1_fdfflyz,1578385764.0,Well here in Uk that‚Äôs not the case
cursedcomments,fdg91b2,t1_fdg8sl8,1578385214.0,Yes you‚Äôre right. This is much worse than usual and people who don‚Äôt think so are just trying to make themselves feel safe
destiny2,fdep3ys,t1_fdenx55,1578343678.0,Ok. I died when Dul was 1 hp and the last knight killed me. Ive gottem so worked up that I‚Äôve decided to try again after reset after I‚Äôm not so frustrated . I‚Äôm really hoping to finish it all next week
destiny2,fdejm84,t1_fdehvjt,1578340419.0,Thanks for the help. The main thing I‚Äôve been struggling with is damage phase. She keeps deleting me every time I try to shoot her. It sucks that I‚Äôm gonna have to go through Vorgeth again because I‚Äôm not allowed on during the week. üò≠üò≠

OrthodoxChristianity,fde0qtl,t1_fdd7xyc,1578328565.0,This is interesting because my priest just did a service on this topic and I believe the same as you that if people reject God then they will be made uncomfortable by his light.
Christianity,fddrdym,t3_eku7k9,1578321986.0,Ah a fellow orthodox Christian.

dankchristianmemes,fcpz160,t3_eibl02,1577875213.0,I mean I go to a Greek Orthodox Church but I can only understand Greek if it‚Äôs spoken slowly so for all I know people are gossiping and I don‚Äôt understand it.
