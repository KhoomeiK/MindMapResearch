”The Hearing Voices Movement has been criticised for its stance on medication and schizophrenia and for promoting non-medical and non-evidence-based approaches to severe mental illnesses in articles by Susan Inman from the Huffington Post, such as ""People Who Hear Voices Need Science-Based Advice"" in 2013,[86] and ""What You're not Hearing About the Hearing Voices Movement"" in 2015.[87]
Specific criticisms of the hearing voices approach include:

using ideas that don't support science-based ways of understanding illness

undermines people's trust in medical help that might be crucial to their wellbeing

encourages people to focus on their voices when they may be having a hard time differentiating between what's real and what's not real

doesn't recognize the very different needs of people with severe mental illnesses

by failing to differentiate between the needs of people who actually have psychotic disorders and those who don't, HVM poses serious risks

poses real danger for the substantial number of people who lack insight into their psychotic disorder

people struggling with psychotic symptoms shouldn't be advised to emphasize the meaning of auditory hallucinations

polyamory,feeiptv,t1_fdtewgf,1579034558.0,"I meet people everywhere I go and I'm open to any connection that someone may need in the moment. I talk to almost anyone who starts a conversation with me. On the train, at the grocery store, lost tourist on the street have all become dear friends and potential partners. I don't go looking for romance & intimacy as a primary target, those come later after I know we can be friends first. Sex is separate for me. I don't generally enjoy random hookups and one night stands, but I see no reason why friends can't play together without getting romantically involved.  Sex is an activity. Whereas romance and intimacy are more feelings to me. 

I acknowledge that I have an advantage in that my appearance naturally attracts a lot of curiosity, so I don't often have to approach people, they tend to find me.  Nonetheless, most of my time is spent listening, commiserating, and helping these new people in my life. Many develop into lasting friendship, few develop into more.   

I don't have any great resources that aren't the standards listed all over the sub. I listen to the Multiamory podcast, read ethical slut a decade ago. My exposure to relationship anarchy is limited to the subreddit and Google, but I'm learning more as my husband digs deeper in that arena. We've been practicing poly for about a year and a half, though there have been situations going back to the beginning of our relationship 20 years ago. 

I do understand how people get sucked into the PUA circles, I just don't have the energy to do the deprogramming myself. I have no problem with people who have realized the issues and are out of or working away from those ideas. In fact, I'm happy to talk through those things, I'm just not willing to fight about it."

HOWEVER,  I will run far and fast from anyone who uses the lingo of pick-up artists because PUA's aren't concerned with the human on the other end of the sexual transaction. It's about pursuit and conquering, and keeping score.  They tend to be about quantity over quality, and come with a whole host of boundary ignoring behaviors.  
So if you've moved away from those attitudes, it's time to pay attention to your vocabulary.  

You can be a ""respectful playboy"" but you will still have a much much smaller dating pool than the wide wide world of single monogamists.  Look into solo poly and relationship anarchy if you want to dig deeper into the philosophies that may hit some of the same buttons as the PUA communities, but from an ethical perspective instead of a manipulative one.

I (38F) would prefer any new partners of mine to be partnered in some way, just so that I couldn't be 100% of their focus.  However, this leads to my next point, I'm not actively out looking to start something new, because I know the time I have to dedicate to a new relationship is limited.  So you won't find me on dating apps, or out at singles/hookup events. That doesn't mean I wouldn't be open to a relationship if the right person entered my sphere. That said, 'the right person' would be someone who was interesting and empathetic and confident and could work with my schedule."
