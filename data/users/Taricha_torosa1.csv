I can honestly tell you this:
You are not alone, you are loved, and there are alot of people who support you.  There are plenty of organizations that can help you, if you want to reach out to them.  Help is there for those who ask.

Also, you have a great smile!"
toastme,fe6iwg2,t3_enyc2t,1578892338.0,"Exactly 2 years ago this week, I went through a similar relationship situation... it seems a little scary, but you can get through it.

You are smart and strong enough to make your life better,  just focus on yourself.  If you can, surround yourself with supportive friends/family.

2 years ago I broke up with my SO, we were enganged, and it took a miracle for me to realize how unhappy I was.  With a few months left on our apartment lease, I did my best to stay civil but break-ups can be emotional... so I stayed with friends on weekends and sometimes during the week.  I was studying for a certification exam, getting out to a coffee shop or cafe made it easier to focus.

I'm so much happier now and I don't regret my decision for a second.  Trust yourself, work hard, and you will get to a better place in life."
