>He says he is just being caring by saying that. I think he is full of shit.

If there was reason for him to believe you missed your meds (based on history), then his ""just being caring"" MIGHT be valid - but only if you were experiencing irritability that was out of the norm for you while stable and therefore likely a symptom. If he is doing this about healthy, natural emotions and reactions, it seems to me he is invalidating your thoughts and feelings. 

Be careful here - when people have done this to me, they have become increasingly manipulative and abusive, and used my illness to eliminate any credibility on my part, and make me out to be always at fault. I hope this does not happen to you - keep paying attention.

P.S. The period thing is pure sexist bullshit. All people have hormonal fluctuations, all people have varying levels of different emotions. Implying that menstruating women are totally at the mercy of their cycles and unable to control or understand their feelings? This guy might as well diagnose you with Female Hysteria."
bipolar,ff5fmz4,t3_erdyh0,1579590775.0,I haven't gone on eMoods in...(switches over to check last day on app) over a month. I am getting back into it starting now. Thanks for the reminder.

US fair housing laws require landlords to allow ESAs in most situations as long as it does not create an unfair burden on the landlord. But ESAs are not allowed in public places that prohibit pets, while service dogs are. Good luck, pets can be great but also a big commitment."

bipolar,ff5ets7,t3_ergbyh,1579589820.0,"This sounds really cool!  Just a note on the anti-psychotics, it hit me hard too, could hardly move the next day, but it took a few weeks of increasing dose from 50 to 250 before it really started affecting my hypo/mixed episode at the time, I am now at 350 for a few months and doing ok"
bipolar,ff5ekv6,t3_eriu9w,1579589538.0,"Yes to both, but mixed especially. My last really bad episode I had to have music blaring through headphones constantly to attempt to drown it out, plus a near-constant low-level flow of alcohol to slow/quiet it (not recommended)"
bipolar,fewv5ab,t3_eqswcr,1579419975.0,This really hit home. Thanks for sharing
bipolar,fel8201,t3_ep1mo0,1579216074.0,"Just got ""promoted"" - actually I will be doing the exact same type and amount of work, but I will actually getting paid for *most* of the hours I work (rather than half the hours or less), and at a somewhat higher wage ($2 more per hour). 

Although it still isn't quite what I was hoping for, it feels good that they are happy with my work, and there is a good chance of a good-paying, full time job that I really want in a few months."

Parenting,fc21yut,t3_efmw2o,1577337225.0,"A possible solution would be to buy her a small lock-box to keep her medications in.

As someone who takes several important pills daily, it is very helpful for me to keep them somewhere convenient.  For me, I take them at night, so I keep them by my bed - it helps me remember and makes it easy to take them when I should.  

As the parent of a small child, I make this work by keeping my meds in a case with a combination lock.  This was an inexpensive solution to the issue for me.  

If your MIL is doing this for convenience, rather than simply being reckless, buying her a nice lockbox she can keep wherever she wants could fix this problem.  Make sure the lock is easy to use, not too small if she has arthritis for example.  If this doesn't work though, you may have to listen to the other comments...good luck."
