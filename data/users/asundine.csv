bose,ffhmfgy,t1_ffgsdlm,1579942281.0,"The XM3s were terrible out of the box. The EQ was absolutely necessary to make them listenable. 

To give credit where credit is due, I did enjoy them with older music. Blasting The Doors or some Grateful Dead worked well. But that was the only time I felt they shone. 

Part of my bias comes from the fact that I'd had my QCs for a year before the 700s came out lol. I do wish I had an EQ. Fortunately the ""natural"" Bose sound is pretty spot on."
FordExplorer,ffhagql,t3_etiyyp,1579927887.0,PTU (transfer case) and the chain driven water pump in V6s are the two major flaws in this car. My PTU failed 2 years ago and I'm having the water pump done preemptively in a few weeks. 2011 XLT. Other than that it has been 100% problem free. I did a lot of suspension work around 100k but that is to be expected.

bose,ffgpvy5,t3_etb8qi,1579912042.0,"The XM3s are bass heavy, flat, and muffled. Not to sound like a snob but they attract the kind of people who think beats sound good.

I compared the two side by side and preferred my qc35s, but I totally understand why people prefer the 700s. Both are excellent headphones and it comes down to a matter of opinion when choosing between the two."
depression,fferjdj,t1_ffergwu,1579862000.0,see i've tried that and it never did much for me. different strokes for different folks i guess. how exactly do you do it?
confusingperspective,ffdsc0l,t3_ese2hl,1579827701.0,Dw it got me too at first
depression,ff3m9in,t1_ff2nl8n,1579544066.0,"Thanks, but philosophy has never been a thing for me. I'll look into it but I can't see myself coming to terms with death right now. 

I've been in therapy for years. I have a process for dealing with myself when my mental health is in the dumpster like it is now. This post was just a middle of the night thought.

Thank you for your support though. That's why I'm in this group."
depression,ff2ko6s,t1_fex0r8w,1579510570.0,"Square one is going back to suicidal mode. It's not always triggered by relationships. I had issues at work last that put me back in that place. I was away from home for 2 weeks on a work trip 5 months ago that also put me in that place. I'm unable to cope with stress. My first reaction is ""well, might as well just die"". 

I have external success. I lost 80lbs 4 years ago and kept it off. I have a career that I love. I have worked hard to make myself into the man I am today. 26 year old me is so much different than 21 year old me. But yes, a ton of my self worth is tied to relationships. I keep failing at them over and over, and I feel like I've done all I can to make myself into the best partner I can be. Am I constantly getting dealt a shit hand? Am I falling too hard too fast? This last one fell hard for me too, and it felt genuine to me. We said I love you. We talked about our futures. Everything seemed just right. I've had enough relationships in my adult life to detect red flags and there weren't any here. So what the fuck is wrong with me. Why does this keep happening. I'm so fucking lonely. I'm tired of being lonely.

As I was sitting in my car balling my eyes out a few hours ago (she officially broke it off tonight), I found myself shouting out loud at my self. ""I can't take this anymore. I'm so fucking tired of being alone. I will never be happy. It's time to just put a fucking bullet in my brain.""

""But what if I just end up as another hopeless sad sack of shit?""

That thought got me through tonight. I've gotta be up for work in 5 hours. Can't decide if I should grin and bear it or take the easy way out by sitting at home all day drinking, cutting, and crying with my cat."
depression,feznahu,t1_fewrt3z,1579459276.0,Nice dude. I'm working on my friends house today. Not my favorite way to spend a Sunday but at least he pays me.
depression,fewsw9t,t1_fews6hi,1579419000.0,"It's terrifying the first time you do it. I was shaking so hard. It's a good thing I used my duller pocket knife the first time because if I hadn't I would have made some pretty nasty cuts.

But, I focused, did some deep breathing, punctured my skin with the blade and away I went. After that it's quite easy. I didn't have any fear of it moving forward. I enjoy the pain and I love seeing the blood. I get a sort of high from it and I feel a lot better for a few hours after I do it."

subarulegacy,fehtxio,t1_fehr5jg,1579123799.0,"Nice. Auto or Manual?

I replaced my timing belt and valve cover gaskets in 2015 only for it to crack a piston 2 weeks later. I've spent about $12k over the years. I'd say 1/3 of that was on mods though, there's very little that's stock on my car."
depression,fehq4ml,t3_eoxun3,1579121642.0,It never feels right when things are going OK for me. I spend my time waiting for the next inevitable downward spiral. I don't feel like I deserve to be happy either. It's simultaneously miserable and comfortable being depressed.

FordExplorer,fehpvg0,t3_ep3oqa,1579121494.0,It's amazing the kind of work that comes out of dealers sometimes. Can't believe they missed that.
depression,fe6b5h3,t3_enrs4c,1578885953.0,"Yes. All the time. I don't even like saying the words ""mental health"" or ""depression"" out loud, much less talking about my suicide attempt and fantasies. I feel ashamed of it. I tell myself that I am just over reacting, because there are people out there with cancer and here I am a healthy 26 year old who just hates himself. I know In the back of my mind that mental health struggles are very valid, depression is a disease, and it does take lives because it causes people to lose control. And yet... I can't get over the feeling that I'm just a pussy."
subarulegacy,fdkmn0a,t3_eltj4h,1578506717.0,Don't expect to get anywhere near what you've invested in it. I'd say 8k depending on your location. I'm in Portland OR where Subarus fetch a heavy price. Where are you located?
cars,fdih39a,t3_elcxes,1578442765.0,A manual transmission has never stopped me from multitasking while driving and I'm sure it won't stop your son.
OkCupid,fdb3qf3,t3_ek9b65,1578253374.0,"There is nothing wrong with your lack of attraction, but don't tell him. There will be someone else who finds him attractive and it's okay if it's not you. Telling him to lose 20lbs first would be a pretty dickish thing to say. 

In 2018 I broke up with my girlfriend of a year mostly because I wasn't attracted to her anymore. There were other reasons of course but that was the main one. She was becoming pretty overweight and eating a LOT. I didn't have the heart to tell her, so I ended it. I couldn't help the fact that I wasn't interested in sex with her (it was pretty bad anyway). It took me a while to not feel as bad about the way I felt. It's only natural. Physical and sexual attraction matter, and if it's not there then you can't be expected to pursue the relationship."
subarulegacy,fcvivf3,t1_fcvay4r,1578003032.0,The question on everybody's mind. It's a shame that most are auto.
subarulegacy,fc4yxdk,t3_eg7paw,1577434564.0,"It's very Subaru that's for sure. I don't like it, but if it's a GT I'll let it slide. I don't know shit about 5th gens so I can't tell if that's a debadged GT."
AmItheAsshole,fc1pgiu,t3_efks8c,1577325582.0,"YTA. Echo Dots are what, $25 this time of year? They didn't get the memo for some reason, whatever. It seems to me that they legitimately wanted to give you a gift and didn't know what to get you. I don't think it came from a sense of obligation either. Sure, you don't need another Echo Dot. Give it to a friend or something. Why insult your parents like that? They tried, but it sounds like they don't know you very well so they had no clue what to get you. Accept their gift and instead consider establishing a better relationship with your parents instead of having a fit over a $25 Amazon echo.

PS in case you didn't know, you can change the wake word on Amazon devices. I use ""echo"" because Alexa is difficult to say for someone who slurs their speech like I do. Probably too late for grandpa to change things up on him but hey it's worth knowing."
