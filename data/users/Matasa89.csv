*You are always going to matter more to the GOP than the very best of the African American community.*

This is why Nazis dare march in the streets once more."
SandersForPresident,fgl67yg,t1_fgkqbst,1580883401.0,"Please don't do that. Trump's damage to the nation and the world far outstrips whatever damage Clinton could have ever done.

Another four years of Trump and there may be no going back. Vote out Trump and hold the new guy's feet to the fire."

politics,fgl33up,t1_fgl0fbj,1580880507.0,"They'll say that, but not even consider how one side is giving the political equivalent of a middle finger, while the other is full on salting the earth."
politics,fgl30i8,t1_fgkznp7,1580880427.0,"Exactly. People like this are the same as those who condemned those who acted out in defiance to the Nazis because ""they're being uncouth!""

You cannot remain placid in front of evil."
politics,fgl1ke8,t1_fgkzpoi,1580879177.0,"Far right commentator is Richard Spencer the actual Nazi.

worldnews,fgkbgw9,t1_fgk7ib6,1580861694.0,"They don't get anything. If their family hasn't completely abandoned them in the woods or something, they're often just kept at home like some kind of house pet - no dignity, no extra effort, just an extra mouth of feed."
askscience,fgjna82,t1_fgjmm5y,1580847546.0,I think so. You could actually buy new queens for a colony that lost their own as well.

SandersForPresident,fgjlpal,t1_fgiwxfg,1580846619.0,"2nd scenario.

They're already approaching her for that. Better the capitalist that wants to limit you, than the social democrat that wants to kneecap you."
SandersForPresident,fgjl74r,t3_eyqdn0,1580846325.0,"He's a New Yorker at heart alright. He walks like he means business. Don't block his path, he's got places to be, shit to do."
arknights,fgjiq0c,t1_fgip13k,1580844875.0,"I wouldn't call her evil.

I mean, we don't know what Lungmen and Wen did to her. She was obviously a citizen at one point. Her response may be extreme but may not be entirely unwarranted.
