$38.99 is the average wage for a nurse employed by AHS. 

Hospitals operate 24hrs a day 365 days a year.  You will require nursing care round the clock. 

A lot of nursing staff work 12hrs shifts on average and sometimes they do a little over time and some times they even do a 16hrs shift.  

Maybe if you weren't so blinded by partisan politics and a clear disdain for the Alberta Conservative party you could actually go out and look for the answers yourself.  I've provided numbers for employment of nursing staff, the average wage for a nurse employed by AHS, the operating cost to care for patients, and numbers for the top doctors of the board."
alberta,feyolhr,t1_feyhc4r,1579448364.0,"The average wage for an RN, who is a front line worker, is $38.99 and let's say that they work 50hrs a week and they  continue that working schedule for the year.  That would give the average nurse about 90k a year. 

About 10.3 billion dollars goes to actual inpatient care across the board.  

AHS employs about 26000 nurses. 26000 nurses getting an average of 38.99 an hour is about 1 million dollars an hour."

Alberta Health Services president and CEO Dr. Verna Yiu was the health authority’s top paid employee, receiving more than $575,000 in base pay last year along with more than $78,000 in “other” compensation (non-taxable benefits).
Second on the list was Francois Belanger, vice-president and chief medical officer, who earned nearly $503,000 in base compensation and $68,000 in benefits.
The health authority had five people who surpassed the half-million mark in total compensation.

A total of 2,229 AHS employees reached the threshold in 2017 that required them to be included on the sunshine list, down from 2,335 the previous year.
The health authority is by far the province’s largest employer, with more than 100,000 staff on its payroll.
AHS paid out more than $3.2 million in severance in 2017, more than double the $1.4 million from the previous year. The biggest cheque went to Ann Colbourne, the former senior medical director of transformation and innovation, who received more than $309,000 in severance in addition to $320,000 in salary and benefits.
Colbourne is the new board chairwoman of NorQuest College and gave a $1 million donation to the college this week.
Former AHS senior program director David Matear received severance of more than $308,000.
At Covenant Health, president and CEO Patrick Dumelie was paid nearly $539,000 in base compensation in 2017 — a slight drop from the previous year — along with $32,000 in non-taxable benefits.
Dumelie was the only Covenant employee to break the half-million-dollar mark, though the Catholic health agency had five people earn more than $300,000 in total compensation last year.
Editor’s note: This story has been corrected to adjust the threshold salary above which government workers’ compensation is publicly reported for 2017."

alberta,fdoitxe,t3_emb64w,1578606017.0,"Technical term for these is 22° halo. 

There’s an old weather saying: ring around the moon means rain soon. There’s truth to this saying, because high cirrus clouds often come before a storm. Notice in these photos that the sky looks fairly clear. After all, you can see the sun or moon. And yet halos are a sign of high, thin cirrus clouds drifting 20,000 feet or more above our heads.  These clouds contain millions of tiny ice crystals. The halos you see are caused by both refraction, or splitting of light, and also by reflection, or glints of light from these ice crystals. The crystals have to be oriented and positioned just so with respect to your eye, in order for the halo to appear.
That’s why, like rainbows, halos around the sun – or moon – are personal. Everyone sees their own particular halo, made by their own particular ice crystals, which are different from the ice crystals making the halo of the person standing next to you."

meme,fcu3g9a,t3_eite39,1577971446.0,"The Pleistocene Epoch is typically defined as the time period that began about 2.6 million years ago and lasted until about 11,700 years ago. The most recent Ice Age occurred then, as glaciers covered huge parts of the planet Earth.

At the time of the Pleistocene, the continents had moved to their current positions. At one point during the Ice Age, sheets of ice covered all of Antarctica, large parts of Europe, North America, and South America, and small areas in Asia. In North America they stretched over Greenland and Canada and parts of the northern United States. The remains of glaciers of the Ice Age can still be seen in parts of the world, including Greenland and Antarctica.

Global warming or Climate change is happening because we are living during the very end of an Ice age."
