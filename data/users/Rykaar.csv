And this is on top of the fact that most psychological experiments are failing to be reproduced. The field is barely 100 years old and it's still barely got a leg to stand on beyond the biology.

Most people respect the field of psychology more than they should given these problems. Obvious as this problem sounds, most people do not consider the field from the researcher's perspective (and most of us here likely hadn't considered this before today). Psychology is still viewed as expertise, because that's its goal, not its product. It's the best we've got but it's not much, and (the point is) it's not trying the best it could. 

80% of research grants sound like they *could* go overseas, if the funding was in the interest of the field. But it's likely that much of that money is an investment to learn to manipulate the most money out of you by advertising companies. Such is life; what a dismal waste of careers."

The difference between leaving crumbs on the bench for someone else to clean and leaving the economy in ruins and surviving off the taxpayer is simply a matter of position and power (which scales consequence). There are few measures or checks that keep the corrupt out of power, because there are few who actually deserve to be there. Despite the fact that doing so would save trillions of dollars and billions of lives globally.

To conspire is to share the guilt and maintain the secret (even out of compassion). It's voluntary blackmail you get to profit from. It's that easy. Two kids pretending they didn't break something scales up to the GFC and its aftermath.

The conscience is the quietest voice in your head, and it doesn't take long to build a habit of ignoring it, especially when you profit from it short-term.

Christ takes the sins of the world upon himself and is reborn, transcending his unjust mortal suffering. The Buddha becomes enlightened and ends his painful reincarnation to the suffering inherent to life. Interesting though how Christ's rebirth is a phoenix transformation that transcends him from mortal world, but the Buddha's is what ties him to the world and must be stopped for that transcendence.

>I never said killing SHOULDNT be last resort.

But you certainly said that it was a good thing to do, and that thinking otherwise comes from a place of evil. The simple matter is that you shouldn't have let it get to that point. If it gets to that point then you haven't done everything to prevent it, and you should feel bad about being in that position. Society corrupts from the bottom up. If you have to kill a politician, you deserve all that drove you to it because you and everyone else bloody let them get there. 

Russia and China killed more than their leaders, and despite their power, I'll bet you'd never live there, at least in part, for that reason. Your protests in America are just asking someone else to do something about your problems. In the former USSR, you'd be denying the Communist Utopia and sent to a Gulag for dissent. But it was the revolutionary proles that put those murderers in power. And the USSR inevitably fell, and the remnants will fail as much as they cling onto the hubris that put them there.

If you felt smart writing that, re-evaluate. You're rationalising anger. Making excuses for your desire to see others killed.
