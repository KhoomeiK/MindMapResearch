Theyre the cutest kids on TV and they were a joy to watch. I wish them a long and successful career!"
aww,ffh7j7i,t1_ffh6s7h,1579925321.0,"A service animal is specifically trained in certain tasks to aid in a patient's disability (such as guiding a visually impaired patient), unlike therapy dogs/ESA's who provide general comfort/companionship. 

If you do not have a disability, you cannot ""decide"" that an animal is a service animal.

Businesses cannot ""decide"" if you're disabled or not. They may ask if the animal is a service animal and what tasks they are trained for, but they may not ask the nature of your disability, or  proof of a ""certification"" (as no such governing entity or registry exists). 

However, if the animal in question is misbehaving or causes damage, they may request the animal's removal or hold the handler liable for damages."
aww,ffh3ka5,t1_ffh33p6,1579922158.0,"I'm not talking about ESA's. Im talking about service dogs. 

There are many fake websites selling ""certifications"" or dog training ""courses"" and ""service dog exams"" when no such requirement exists under ADA.

There is no certification, exam, or registry for service dogs. In fact, this is a direct violation of ADA.

The other commentor is incorrect in saying that service dogs need to be certified. That is a direct violation of ADA."
Futurology,ffgztg8,t1_ffgc0hc,1579919318.0,Haha good luck when lanes merge or if there's an obstruction on the road.
aww,ffgy63x,t1_ffgvw0u,1579918087.0,"There is no ""certification"" or ""exam"" or ""national registry"" for service animals. This is against the ADA, and incorrect information regarding the changes that the Department of Transportation may be enacting regarding ""emotional support animals"" versus service dogs."
