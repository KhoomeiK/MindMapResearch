MMFB,fd1ke02,t3_ejt55i,1578132461.0,"I'm not sure what you're asking, but I think drinking that much soda and not having energy are closely related. If you haven't been checked for diabetes or pre-diabetes, I would recommend you do so. Also caffeine has a half life of 8 hours, so if you drink it past late afternoon there's a good chance it's interfering with the quality of your sleep. Plus even if it's not strictly speaking a diabetic issue, you're going to have insulin spikes and crashes which can make you tired. 

You can get caffeine withdrawal symptoms, so it might make sense to reduce the amount over a period of time. If you have a sweet tooth, maybe you could try switching to dark chocolate or fruit to get some sweetness."

Sorry for teasing. I've thought there was a radio playing, or that my name was being called when no one else was around. I'd bring it up to your doctor but in my case it wasn't serious"
bipolar,fcc2yui,t3_eh0sko,1577593818.0,"The way I see it, alcohol and bipolar both can lower your inhibitions and ability to control emotions. Also for me and I think generally drinking with bipolar should be done rarely if at all. Substance abuse and bipolar mix together a lot."

bipolar,fcbog1b,t1_fcbo9sl,1577589198.0,Thanks! It feels like one I've heard someplace but I've got no idea where lol
bipolar,fcbl3q2,t1_fcbja4x,1577588124.0,"Not the person you asked, but I have. It might be a sign that your dose was too high, or that you should try other meds. It's been years of trial and error. For almost all meds at almost all doses, I didn't feel like ""my old self"". The few times I've tried going off of them, at first I did, then things spiralled badly. I like to think this story has a happy ending, as I've reduced the number of meds and dosages to a level where I feel pretty ""normal"" by my standards. But most of the past decade it's been pretty hard."
bipolar,fcbjj06,t3_egzxbo,1577587602.0,Wishing you the same

bipolar,fc7qj6v,t3_eggbzr,1577516076.0,"Out of all the meds I've ever taken for my bipolar, vraylar waa the best. But I think everyone can have their own reaction."
bipolar,fc7o31b,t3_eglvgj,1577514006.0,I've gotten into crochet for similar reasons! It's so easy and inexpensive
