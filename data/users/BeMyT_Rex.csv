Bit the biggest issue comes from politics.

The whole left-wing, right-wing issue. Both sides hate each other, as well as the centrists who hate both. If one side supports the science, it would take a damn right miracle for the other 1 or 2 to also side with science. Best example was this year in Australia. One side of it was promising majority electric cars by a certain year in the country as well as hinting he may take climate action(ScuMo has not done anything of the sort). The other ridiculed the idea, and the majority of our media sided with the ridicule because they are run by Murdoch.

Even in the US, a Democrat thinks Climate Change is an issue, the majority of Republican will likely be completely against what they said, simply because they are a Democrat.

Politics have done such a ""good"" job at dividing their nations that it would almost be more efficient to have every country run by a Dictator. Obviously that would suck, looking at Russia(Homophobic), China(obviously), Saudi Arabia(Sneeze in the wrong direction you're dead) and many others."
