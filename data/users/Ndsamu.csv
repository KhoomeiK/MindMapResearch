bestof,ffskj13,t1_ffs63nl,1580183974.0,"Honestly what I need is a summary of everything Trump has done *right* from the opposing side. My parents have lived through many presidencies and I accept their conservative bias but from the way they describe it Trump (no matter how ridiculous he is) supposedly restored the presidential role to what it formerly was. They give the impression that his “make America great again” slogan is actually genuine. I may disagree with most of what he says but even if by accident there has to be a few things he’s done right.

It’s hard to honesty evaluate any presidential candidate because this bipartisan approach has seemingly devolved into a reality tv show. I think most of us would agree. It’s so much less about “here’s what I have to offer” and so much more about “well s/he’s worse than me.” I try to stay out of politics for fear of becoming another blind follower. The problem is the people who become so convinced of their party that it becomes their identity and no matter how far their policies go they will back them. People compromise on their values for sake of their loyalty to their political affiliations."

nextfuckinglevel,ffrb2e8,t1_ffnv845,1580154339.0,"Exactly. There’s such a massive difference between someone who does it right and someone who’s genuinely passionate about what they do. People can accept a mistake here and there but they will not accept an emotionless, dry performance. 

This girl is the embodiment of what children offer the world. That innocent raw passion without fear of any judgement or failure. Pursuing their interests purely for there own self-serving curiosity. The older population often “rests on their lapels” but there’s just as much to be learned from the youth as there is the old and wise. We have to learn that we all fall victim to our own limited perspective on the world. Being open to other world views, no matter how naive, only betters us as people."

Once you become a whole person then the relationship is a nice cherry on top.

On top of that, the media teaches us that facts don’t matter. Whatever makes the biggest headline ends up being the biggest story. Often times these headlines are later proved false.
