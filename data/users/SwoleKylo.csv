depression,femjcu7,t1_femiu9f,1579258548.0,"Honestly, caffeine makes me feel good but I think that's chemical dependence talking. 

I spend my free time weight training (mostly powerlifting, some weightlifting). I've been wanting to compete for a while, but for now I just train to hit personal goals I've set for myself.  I stay motivated because I can numerically and visually see the progress I've made over the last couple years. I feel like I'm improving myself little by little with every workout. My confidence has definitely improved. It's not pseudoscience when people say exercise helps clear your mind. I use my self doubt, anger, and anxiousness to fuel myself even when I'm physically exhausted. 

I also picked up sim racing a bit over a year ago. It's a slippery slope and a real money sink but I love immersing myself in another world to relax. If for just a couple hours I can pretend I'm a race car driver, that's a couple hours I don't feel the crushing weight of irl responsibilities.

I work out and use anger and self hatred as fuel. 

I listen to music probably 70% of the day. Metal, EDM, rock... whatever fits my mood. 

I have hobbies I really enjoy and invest time in. Out of all, my hobbies are probably the most important. I know what I'm doing with my free time so I don't have the opportunity to wallow in self pity.

WritingPrompts,fcmt55q,t3_ei0wu6,1577791001.0,"We call it the flood but it had nothing to do with water. Instead, my city's streets were flooded by human bodies. The teleportation machines were so new and temperamental that something was bound to go wrong, but who could've predicted how horribly. They sent their sick and poor in an attempt to destroy our economy. If only that had been the outcome. 

They must've done very few tests prior to the attack, or maybe they just didn't care. Hundreds of thousands of people were instantly teleported above my city. I don't want to think about the possibility that no calculations went wrong and that this was the true intention. 

I was inside of an office building when it began. Dozing off in front of my computer, I was startled by screams of terror reverberating across the floor. Alert, I shot up from my cubicle to see what had caused the commotion. One look out the window and I shared the same look of shock and panic as my colleagues. They rained down like meteorites, destroying cars and pedestrians alike. They thudded into the glass windows and bounced off, leaving crimson smears. They landed with so much force that they bounced off the concrete. 

Worse than the sight, was the sound. Crunching, squishing, screaming, pounding. The bodies fell for only a few minutes but in that time they piled up high enough that I could've jumped out my 8th storey floor and survived. That was a few days ago. I'm still at work because the corpses are blocking all our exits. There's talk of simply jumping out the window. 

I don't know how much longer I can handle the stench."
