Small victories are not happening and they don't propel change, they extend the status quo.  We need transformative change.

I get your position, and there is a time for that style of politics, but this is not it.  Big changes are already underway, from the LRT/Ontario Line to elimination of wasteful surface parking lots ([example](https://urbantoronto.ca/news/2019/08/23-building-neighbourhood-transform-golden-miles-walmart)) to the City's recent talks on redeveloping 1/3rd of single home neighbourhoods to fill the ""missing middle"" (City website launching soon).  

These are *big* victories that have been talked about for decades not small ones.  

How much money would we save not having to deal with Presto, maintaining gates, fare inspectors, and all the other operational costs of collecting.  Then add in the benefits of having all that mobility without restriction.  You call it bullshit, yet the only argument against it is ""people don't want to pay for taxes""... so why are people getting upset at a fare evader?  He's just one more who doesn't want to pay taxes in the form of user fees.  

Once we have things that are a common good we appreciate them and defend them.  Why is it so hard then to envision a new common good?  Are we really so worried about the top 10% of income earners ability to absorb a tax increase on their million dollar homes?  They're currently paying 22% less than average btw.

T3 is simple, the landlord discontinued gas/water utilities so you're seeking a reduction equal to the worst case scenario for the cost of utilities. (s.130 of the Act)

T2 is for a violation of s.125 of the act and a rebate of any money paid to date.  You did not agree to the discontinuing of ""Water or sewage services, excluding capital work."" - this is your best bet for getting the water back into the landlord's name.

Wuhan is similar, the median age of those who've died is 75, so people are definitely overreacting.  There has only been 1 death of someone who was a healthy adult (36, male), all other deaths were elderly or co-morbidities existed.  

The big difference is the mortality rate.  Excluding Wuhan province cases, the rate is about 0.3% - that would be up to 112,770 Canadian deaths if it became as widespread as influenza. That number rises to 751,800 Canadian deaths if Wuhan province cases are included (~2% mortality rate)
