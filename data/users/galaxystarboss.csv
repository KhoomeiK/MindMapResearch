I always lose fat from around my stomach first, and my butt last.  The only way to reduce the mid section fat (which is likely the last place your body will lose fat from) is just to lower your overall body fat percentage.

Being married to your husband was not a good decision. You weren't happy, and leaving him was the right thing to do.  I think if you'd continue being married, it would have led to resentment and possibly a more bitter divorce down the line.

You persued this new guy, and it didn't work out.  But that doesn't mean that your husband is the right man for you.  You used this new guy as a crutch to get through this divorce, and now that it's ended you realise that you are now alone, which is absolutely terrifying after a long term relationship.  You saught to go back to your husband to have that reassure in your life, but he is not able to provide it.  It's okay.  You will meet someone else, and will likely be happier than either of these two relationships has made you.  Just work on being by yourself and improving your flaws.  Good luck."
