But point is don’t judge a book by its cover. I learned very early I preferred the feeling weed gives me over alcohol. I like drinking, but it makes you constantly have to pee, stumbly(weed will only do that maybe if you drink after, or smoke A LOT) and have a horrible headache and queasiness in the morning. I still DO drink, but weed made me feel better after. And of course, to each their own as long as ur sensible and safe. 

I also knew however I was spending a SHIT TON on student loans and knew that I’d probably be in a HORRIBLE place if I smoked so much that I failed out of school. And I went to a pretty nice college too. 

But yea, there are the obvious ones don’t get me wrong, but there were plenty I knew who had either tried it, did it regularly, or were curious about it that I was like, “waitttt really? You????”

But yea we ALL know the ones who are the lazy stoners haha I’m not doubting that those exist at all lol, just saying there are more than you may have noticed ;)"
science,feev2bw,t1_feerq3h,1579041837.0,"Tbh you’d be surprised about how many smoked and hid it and weren’t obvious, because they were always in class.

This happened to me plenty because I didn’t like being seen as a “lazy stoner” so I only told close friends, but eventually it’d be like I joined on the sessions and they’d be like, “wait YOU smoke????” And it’s like “HELL YEA I just keep it secret because I don’t want the judgement and assumptions”"
gaming,feerdd6,t1_fee6r4m,1579039577.0,I’m gonna need you to get ALL the way off my back about original ideas here!
science,feeqe89,t1_feenmht,1579039004.0,"Being a stoner doesn’t make you lazy. Being lazy makes you lazy.

Sure I DO have less motivation when I smoke, but honestly, normally my mind races and I’m kind of naturally stiff(like my arms don’t naturally relax so I always seem on edge even if I don’t feel that way). Weed allows me to chill out a lot easier and calm my mind. 

Honestly, of course it depends on the person, but I feel extra creative when I smoke :) 

ive been smoking since sophomore year of high school and while freshman year of college was the toughest, I feel it was less me smoking and more being overwhelmed with that college transition.

And to be honest, I’m glad I was an unmotivated pothead than escaping to drinking and becoming an alcoholic, which DOES run in my family, and that would have honestly been the opportune time for the seeds to be planted for me to be.

So I’m glad I chose weed instead :)


And after college, now I’m a paralegal and STILL smoke regularly and actually do a fantastic job(my superiors have told me multiple times directly and indirectly so I’m not just saying that lol)"

science,feepn2h,t1_feen2sz,1579038573.0,"Tbh, I CURE my hangover by smoking. I’m always very hesitant if I don’t have access to weed the next day because it gets rid of that initial headache, AND adds to the hangover appetite.

todayilearned,fee5c7s,t1_fee4t06,1579026716.0,"Billy West’s costars have stated that he does in fact do the script in one recording, not separate sessions.

Many others do them separately, like Hank Azaria on the Simpsons has admitted as such that he has difficulty with his voices blending together if he does them back to back in one session. Nothing wrong with it obviously, but it’s amazing when the actor can do it in one session."
todayilearned,fedwnrv,t1_fedurad,1579021462.0,"It’s enjoyable, but if you’re doing multiple takes, sometimes if the actor isn’t adept enough, the voices begin to blend together.

blender,fedrc1j,t1_fedq15p,1579018223.0,"Valid. 

One of the techniques I’ve seen to make eyes is to take the middle ring of a sphere and protrude it, but I usually see this done with proportional editing.

So making eyes is a good example of needing both functions haha.

But I like that idea, mapping to middle click. I also may just have my mouse to the side for proportional editing, turn off emulate 3 button, and try with middle click on a pen button.

BlenderDoughnuts,fdokgdj,t1_fdl4sn1,1578606951.0,"Long renders are unfortunately part of the job lol.

Pixar takes 24 hours to render a single, fully lit scene, with like, hundreds of computers dedicated to JUST rendering. They do however, have crazy amounts of lights and effects so that does effect it. 

Even Overwatch cinematics, they come out semi often, and it takes like 180 hours to render the few minute shorts.

Hell, Andrew made a tutorial a few years ago(in 2.7, but I’m sure the same thing applies) to speed up Cycles render times."
BlenderDoughnuts,fdok2gq,t3_emelb4,1578606728.0,"The sprinkles are REALLY tiny, in the quick animation, I almost thought you didn’t have them. Maybe have a few differing sizes as life is random and not generated by a particle system ;)

Other than that, the animation is too zippy. Maybe increase the length like 10 or so frames of the donut just sitting there, and it’ll slide in and stop in all it’s glory. 

Right now, like the comment before me said, you can hardly see the details because it’s so fast.

But, animation is an art in itself to get the timing down etc. great first go!"
BlenderDoughnuts,fdjstux,t3_el8z99,1578486253.0,"Only thing I notice to improve the realism is to increase the size of the sprinkles as they seem rather small. I think the next suggestions will be subjective though.

Try playing a bit with the values of the textures on  dough of the doughnut(hide your icing as you’ve been doing to edit so far) and see if you can accomplish different looks. I don’t remember if he said during that part, or at the end, that you could play with the colors and values and get different results like maybe different levels of cooking :) 

Other than that it’s solid, I think a lot of the critique for you right now will be merely artistic, at least until you struggle with the next parts of the tutorial series lol. I think suggestions now can be decided by you to be taken or not at this point because you got the base down, now we will just critique the color and look based on our preference, but that’s what art is isnt it?

Ty for the advice though!"
blender,fd98bdk,t3_ekcequ,1578229812.0,"Unfortunately, as your first project, this seems way to ambitious. Don’t give up on the idea for the future, but without a grasp of the basics, you will get frustrated or give up before any progress is made.

If you notice, a lot of posts here are still images, WIPs, and sometimes short, few second animations.

I’m not saying you HAVE to stick to those things, but the reason why there’s so much of those is because those are the types of things that are typically the easiest to produce. Things like animations and full fledged games, of course take a bit longer to get right.

Don’t give up on your idea though, all of us get started in 3D because of some ambitious and crazy idea we want to emulate, but I just wanna give you this perspective because if you spend too much time on this, without a grasp of the basics, you may not get too far.

I suggest for tutorials you look up Blender Guru beginner tutorial(he has for old and new Blender now), cg boost does a series covering all the basic tools also, and Yansculpts has a basic Blender tutorial AND a basic sculpting tutorial if you wanna get into organic characters. And of course there’s plenty of other beginner tutorials, but those are ones of good quality. 

Best of luck, and feel free to ask questions!"
blender,fd9525h,t1_fd74r2u,1578228555.0,"Thank you! 

I accept that lol. Art, especially sculpting, can be rather horrifying sometimes as you are bunching holes in a skull and slightly editing eye sockets lol.

The only reason why I said the goal wasn’t critique yet is because I didn’t need a bunch of people scrutinizing what I already know still needs plenty of work lol. My goal with this was just to practice with the brushes and get more precise with my tablet, but I was happy I was able to get SOME results, so I got excited and posted the progress lol.

blender,fd6x4y5,t3_ek7kjq,1578196822.0,"Look up what’s new between 2.7 and 2.8. A quick google search also doesn’t hurt. There’s a bunch of videos of the changes and where buttons went. 

Also technically, you don’t NEED to transition to 2.8. I hear many in the community that don’t like it(I love it so I suggest to stick with it) but you just need a bit of learning to get used to 2.8. The tools have only been moved slightly, but the hotkeys are mostly the same.

Best of luck and stick with it! I was in a similar place to you with the depression and the mundanity of my job at the time but when I started to create and conceptualize in 3D, it gave me some more purpose which is just sometimes what we all need.

Any questions feel free to respond here or honestly just ask reddit. Maybe do Blender Guru’s 2.8 donut tutorial or cg boost’s basic 2.8 tutorial where you make a bunch of apples. 

There’s plenty out there and if you’ve done it before. You’ll pick things up again I’m sure! Don’t give up!"
PrequelMemes,fcy1qz0,t3_ejfmp8,1578073546.0,"Look up Life After Pi. It talks about how visual effects are misunderstood and things that should be taking MONTHS to make are sometimes changed like a few weeks before the release, so VFX artists have to rush and put together literal crap.

The reason why it’s called “Life after Pi” is because the studio that worked on that movie, even though the movie was nominated for Oscars, the VFX studio went bankrupt, because although the ENTIRE movie got a bigger budget after a while, the VFX studio didn’t actually see much of that budget increase.

While I agree CGI is going down, it’s not the fault of the VFX studios, as always it’s the corporate bigwigs misunderstanding what it takes to make a movie and convincing visual effects.

Hell, last year we got Thanos, Rocket Raccoon, and Professor Hulk, pretty damn nice effects for Avengers Endgame, and it’s known that FOURTEEN studios worked on all of the effects for that movie!

Also, even if you didn’t like Lion King 2019, those CGI animals were pretty damn good.

So a lot of it is a misunderstanding of what it takes at ALL levels.

Edit: as I thought about this even more for a few hours, I remember that the director for Life of Pi Ang Lee actually was a BIG culprit of misunderstanding what it takes. He criticized that VFX are “too expensive” but those artists have to eat and pay for their lights and roofs over their heads too. During his awards acceptance too, the director actually thanked everyone EXCEPT the VFX studio, and when Rhythm and Hues won best effects, they tried to thank everyone they could and mention the bankruptcy, but they were forced off the stage by the pit orchestra, because they were talking for too long, although Lee won for the SAME picture and talked a lot longer...

TLDR: CGI is amazing, but studios misunderstand what it takes, the time it takes to make it, and the cost it SHOULD be."

Look at anything, cute things have typically rounded shapes and big eyes, evil things/creatures have more angular features, like angled eyebrows signify anger or malicious intent.

Disney has always been the forerunner of “cute”(even if not all of their films are fantastic) and a BIG part of it is the big eyes."
