gaming,fds11s0,t1_fdrxkij,1578692632.0,"Same, though later games I made sure to level all my pokemon equally. The exp all made it trivial to make whole teams too in x/y. Also grew hundreds of leppa berries in that game just to only use 2 in the elite four and never use them again."
gaming,fdr8bud,t1_fdqxohg,1578680887.0,Actually I think lance has 4 of them and could only use two on a single pokemon. This being fire red though idk about original gen 1. Elite four usually being the only place I use these items myself so I think it's pretty fair for them to use them too. You have too much money by the end of every game anyway.
hmmm,fdqzx0l,t1_fdqu4tn,1578677641.0,Yeah I've seen these complaints. Don't remember where though. Hopefully I can buy an index before it comes out for that sweet upgraded hardware.
youtube,fdmevn5,t1_fdmch4g,1578547607.0,Yeah that is a very common complaint. It should fix later. They do this type of stuff sometimes to get feedback about new layouts. If you don't like it make sure you give youtube feedback.

explainlikeimfive,fd3yfam,t1_fd2hkdv,1578162738.0,"Not to mention that the game is PVE. There is really no reason to cheat stuff in if it's not to get one over your opponent. In PVP you can get higher on a scoreboard or a chance to win in a tournament. It doesn't really matter, but people want that recognition at the expense of other people's experience."

patientgamers,fcw3943,t1_fcvncnh,1578016126.0,"Just remember OP if you play Majora's Mask that after you get the ocarina that you can play the song of time backwards to slow down time. Too many people seem to quit the game cause they never found this trick. The first cycle is kinda stressful because you don't know what to do and time moves quick, but after that the time part of the game is easy and is used pretty much for scheduling what to do. I recommend the 3ds version of both Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask for the for the graphics update and some nice gameplay tweaks."

AskReddit,fcoia3b,t1_fcnaph7,1577832890.0,Probably because indie devs would get screwed over by people using stolen credit cards to launder money on key reselling sites. Afterwards they would have to refund all those copies and be in the hole for the transaction fee. I believe the developer of Stardew Valley was quoted in saying that he would rather you pirate his game than you buy it off a key reselling site.
