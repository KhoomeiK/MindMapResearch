What does that even mean? Do you have a list of applications you call ""professional""? What is the definition?"

science,fct86tl,t1_fct7b4z,1577935443.0,"I'm all for going green, I'm just saying the numbers don't add up. If we go green, 30 million more people will be working in energetics and we will pay 1/3 for the energy? THAT MAKES NO SENSE."
science,fct7omz,t1_fcsxsry,1577935056.0,"I live in Europe, so I don't know if it's any different in the US. Here we have free market of energy across the continent and the prices are plummeting. But then there are local subsidies for ""green"" sources and cost of the distribution is going through the roof. The market is not fair since whenever someone builds a renewable power source, the distribution company is obliged to connect him to the network even though it causes issues. There are new huge energy flows going through the net(for example from off-shore wind farms across the continent) and this requires billions in new infrastructure. But this added cost is not considered in any comparison of cost per MWh. The electricity consumption in EU is steadily shrinking(mainly because of outsourcing production to Asia), but the infrastructure is growing. With phase-out of nuclear reactors in Germany, more coal than ever is needed and  a lot of gas power plants are built to serve as a backup for renewables. I don't  advocate fossil fuels, but there are deeper truths behind what the green lobby is claiming.

science,fcsw9rt,t1_fcsitug,1577926718.0,"These numbers don't reflect one very important aspect - reliability. The cost of maintaining the hot-backups, storage facilities and much more complicated distribution networks is now a major part of the utility bill. Renewables like solar and wind might be cheaper per raw MWh, but there are additional costs. I see it in my utility bill every year - my consumption is about the same, the price per kWh is dropping, but the bill is increasing."
