Therefore, if you are conservative, you a are a backwards fucking moron who simply can't adapt, which is whats happening and theyre freaking out. Its why republican office holders are colluding and corrupting democracy in every way to stay afloat. And dont even get me started on fiscal conservatism (which is their only defense nowadays), they have NO idea what the fuck that is. Democrats are the fiscally conservative party, NOT republicans.
