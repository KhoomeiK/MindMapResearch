depression,fekgxee,t3_epm2ch,1579199813.0,"my boyfriend left me a month ago because I started to be a pain in the ass from depression, instead of being the person who cooked for him and washed his clothes. It hurts a lot when someone who is supposed to support you leaves you alone. But at the end of the day, it is best for us that they go to hell. We deserve love and support. They don't deserve shit."
SuicideWatch,fekezkj,t3_epk49c,1579198653.0,"maybe this is somehow selfish but in my ""good"" days i don't read this or the depression subreddit. Makes me feel worse, like maybe i am having a moment of clearness or something like hapiness and the moment i read a post here i remember all the bad stuff that at that moment i am evading, and then i feel sad and suicidal again :("

depression,fc1um76,t1_fc1ty5f,1577330222.0,">Underweight people are definitely judged, think anorexia. No one (aside from anorexic's and maybe modeling companies but they're also starting to glorify being overweight, think Tess Holiday) is gonna glorify being drastically underweight. However the fact remains that obesity is the 3rd leading preventable killer. You wouldn't take the same stance towards alcoholism would you? Just cause a handful of alcoholics can live into there 60-70's drinking 5-7 times a week does not mean that you should then think alcoholism is fine.  
>  
>And before you say that's a bad analogy, nah it ain't. People don't drink everyday cause they love partying and people don't eat themselves to 200kg because they love food. They do it because they feel shit without doing what they do, I get that. It does not mean that it should be considered acceptable and the whole world should learn to love the chronic alcoholic.

That's definitely a bad analogy.    
Think about hypothyroidism, would you judge someone by their weight having that disease? There are people who just can't lose weight. There are people who DO NOT WANT TO. There are people who feel comfortable like that. People with alcoholism, apart from harming themselves, can hurt others. Fat people don't. It is totally incomparable. And he fact that tess holliday has a place in the modeling industry is incredibly empowering, fat women are doubly judged since ALWAYS. That's a win in my book."
depression,fc1tbvq,t1_fc1sf3t,1577329062.0," The fact that being fat is bad for your health (depending on which case, not always) seems to me to be a bit old justification. I don't see that skinny people, models of absolutely all kind of brands of clothing for women, actresses, etc., are judged by their low weight for being harmful to health. You never know why someone is overweight, it can be for different reasons. A fat person can be in perfect health. Someone in ""good shape"" can be very sick.  
Maybe the key is NOT TO JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE'S BODIES. If they are unhealthy, they will know by their own. No one needs a opinion of a stranger about their bodies.

OF COURSE that makes more sense change the whole world."

depression,fc1jyx1,t1_fc1h8pf,1577321023.0,"I don't want to sound rude, but didn't you think that, if it were as easy as saying it, he would have done it already? The solution should not be that he changes his physical appearance because there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is shitty people"

I can no longer please him as before, I was just his comfortable place, now just a nuisance. Thanks, asshole, there is a new reason for me to want to die: even someone i love left me alone! I guess i don't deserve any love."
