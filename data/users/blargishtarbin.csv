But it’s really not that deep. I think the owner is probably aware of the play fight relationship of their pets and simply decided to film it.

I only say this because if a cat wants to hurt something/someone/somedog, by golly that cat will get its licks in.

Edit: nevermind I watched it the first time without audio. After further review, fuck the owner."

This comic very much so reminds me of all of them. Rather than feeling sad and anguish, however, I felt a little bit of joy and warmth. I believe they’re in a better place, pulling the same bamboozling they did on my nana years ago. This post definitely got saved."
