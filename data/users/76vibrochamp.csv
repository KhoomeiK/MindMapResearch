I always took it as a bellwether myself; an automaker that has to discount heavily to move units out the door might just not have the best reputation. For a quality auto, the ""haggle"" room, spread out across the life of a loan, is less than the extended warranty the F&I guy pushes."

PCs and MCMs (mine countermeasure ships) are the only two classes of commissioned vessel with an O-4 in command. Non-commissioned vessels such as riverine craft may have a lower ranking officer as officer in charge, but they are not considered a command.

Destroyers, littoral combat ships and all classes of submarine are an O-5 command billet. Carriers, cruisers, gators (amphibious ships), and submarine tenders are O-6 command billets. A lot of this has to do with crew size (patrol craft have a much smaller crew complement than a destroyer, which has a small complement compared to an aircraft carrier), and prerequisites for command. The commanding officer of a carrier and many amphibious vessels must be a naval aviator, and they do their squadron command tour at the O-5 level. The CO of a tender must have commanded a submarine, again at the O-5 level."
interestingasfuck,fet9aas,t1_fergc2i,1579372906.0,"Finer grain power burns faster. The shape determines the progress of the burn. Spherical powders burn very fast at the beginning, but burn slower once the grains shrink because of the change in surface area. Flat grained powders burn in a roughly linear manner. Rod or stick shaped powders burn progressively, giving a higher pressure late in the burn cycle.

For a real world example of what this can mean, the M16 assault rifle (fires 5.56x45, second from the right) originally used a DuPont IMR stick powder. When DuPont couldn't supply enough powder in the early years of Vietnam, the Army instead switched to a ball powder from Remington. The changes in the pressure curve (a higher pressure immediately after firing, and a lower pressure milliseconds afterwards than the IMR powder) led to a higher rate of fire at full auto, dirtier blowback gases entering the bolt carrier, and a higher rate of failures to fire or eject fired cartridges."

There is no ""whole tape."" There were two separate video recordings. The ""Silly String"" tape was filmed by a news crew contacted by the Routiers. A separate graveside video was recorded by police surveillance. The prosecution turned the second video over to the defense, although they deemed it non-exculpatory. Darlie's own attorneys opted not to show it at the trial, and instead tried to play stupid Fifth Amendment games with the officers who did the recording.

Secondly, it isn't just the Silly String video. Ignoring for the moment, any and all of the forensic evidence collected (which doesn't point towards an intruder, or Darin being downstairs at the time of the murders), Darlie's own friends testified they were horrified by their behavior after the murders. The hospital staff, who deal with grieving people on a daily basis, were disturbed by her lack of interest in her children.
