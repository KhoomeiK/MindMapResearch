oddlyterrifying,fdx6dyc,t1_fdwyu8t,1578765767.0,"Actually, youd be surprised. 
My ex's mom took in her boyfriends dog while he was away on a trip. Damn grumpy dog had fleas and brought them into the house. Then they found their way into a futon where my ex was sleeping, and would bite him all the time, and they hid in the crevices. Only way they got rid of them was buying this weird spray and sprayed it all over the furniture. Killing them all. 

Also, side note.
Dawn soap is great at killing fleas. It's a cheaper more effective alternative than that shitty stuff at the pet store that causes bad allergic/chemical reactions for pets. Just bathe the animal and scrub them with some dawn and the fleas suffocate and die. Its so satisfying

Edit: yes humans cant host fleas. But they can live off them and hide in beds or wherever, and feast when we dont notice. 
Also. My ex's long curly leg hair would entangle them so hed notice when they'd show up and pop them dead."

sexover30,fdl45vp,t1_fdkv1b1,1578516742.0,"Congrats! That's a rarity in most relationships nowadays. With even 20 y/o's having less sex than that. So many of us are working to live. And not living to work. Therefore exhaustion is a major play. Even adding in schedules that dont match, especially those with kids that like to keep one parent at home to be with the kid at all times. Then we have the fear of getting of of this ""loveless"" relationship and risking it all to maybe, possibly find someone who clicks with us the same way and wanting the same thing. Man, the dating pool is limited nowadays. Least that's what I've seen. So many people getting together young. (Not Like I'm to talk Haha)
Yeah....I'm definitely speaking from experience at all. Lol.
10+years to a dying relationship/marriage that I should have left when they cheated the first time. Would have saved time and a lot of heartache and less and less sex over time. Going months without sex."

confessions,fcxmdeg,t3_ej9uar,1578066403.0,"I understand just how hard times can be. I didnt grow up rich. I grew up very poor. I remember times that my parents scrounged around for change in the house just to buy milk. They often went to the food bank as well. I know my father was a proud man and he had grown up poor as well. His fear of having empty cupboards as he did when him and his brothers were growing up, made it so he didnt want the same for his family. And he did the most humble thing he could, and that was going to the foodbank and asking for help. There was times I know he borrowed money from friends to help us stay afloat. All of which he paid back.
My father would even use the money that he kept as collectors items(he wanted to keep them and collect them all so as to have a collection that was worth something in the future). 
You know what I learned from imperfect, but loving parents? I learned that you always try and never give up. Theres always a way to make ends meet by doing what's right. They gave me some of the best memories because of it. I was provided with all necessities and truly learned the value of money. As well as how important it can be to be wise when it comes to grocery shopping and to pay attention to prices. I've learned that money isnt everything and that wonderful and beautiful memories can be made without lots of money.
My father once came across a man in a bank that hed walked into and the man dropped  thousands of dollars of Bills on the floor. The man yelled at my father not to touch it, which he wasnt anyways, but he simply walked away. I'm going through a difficult time right now too. I was at work one day and I discovered over $100 in bills folded up on the floor in a conference room of a office building I was cleaning. (It also has no cameras)It had no regards to whom it belonged to. And I immediately knew I had to put it in an envelope and put it on the managers desk.  It would have gotten me some groceries and gas for sure, both of which I was low on. But I returned it. Knowing, what if it was a payment? What if it was someone's money for supplying necessities for their children? What if it was someone elses gas or food money? What if it was part of  someone's rent?  I returned it and they believed it was a payment to the company. But my boss was so incredibly grateful for my honesty. 
But yeah. I've learned a lot from my poor parents that tried ever so hard to always make ends meet. Hard work, asking for help, and being honest in life is what's needed to make me happy.

Anyways, I'm proud that you saw the wrong even though you wanted it to be right. And that you realized the consequences of these actions could have disastrous effects on you and others around you.  
Take care and keep trying. Never give up my friend! Where theres a will, there is always a way"
BDSMAdvice,fcabqdx,t3_egpmnk,1577566305.0,"Omg hahaha this has me dying. I have often thought of this and I have to really hold back my laughter when this has happened.
