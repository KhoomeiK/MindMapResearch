AskReddit,ffk2w4l,t1_ffids24,1580014135.0,"former 10 year smoker here, havent touched one in \~5 years and never have a desire to go back. The only time an urge would hit would be when an extremely stressful event would occur (see ex's phone number pop up calling you after no contact for many years and ending on bad note, for example) and that was only during the 1st year of being clean, I haven't had an urge in \~4 years

  
The secret? Chantix. Get Chantix. That stuff is magic in pill form.   


Was a pack a day smoker. I took it for 9 months and allowed myself to smoke literally any time I wanted and never tried to argue with myself about having a cig or not. Over those 9 months my cravings slowed to a crawl until I was at 1 cig a day, right before bed. Eventually I decided to go to sleep without one and that began the ""no cig today streak"", and once that was created it just kept going.  


I will say you need to be serious about quitting though. The only downside(s) are A. you get vivid dreams/nightmares (I didn't have nightmares, just really vivid dreams) and B. it makes you feel sick to your stomach for 30 minutes after you take the pill (twice a day)  


Every person I've recommended it to that's tried it has had the exact same result- they take it, their smoking slows down exactly like mine did, then they use the stomach aches/nightmares as an excuse to stop taking it and give up. I'm confident every one of them would have been successful if they didn't give up halfway through."
AskReddit,ffk26ag,t3_ett7fr,1580013511.0,"around 2011 I went through a combination of life events that left me utterly defeated in all aspects (life, income, home, health, emotions, family, etc), around 2 years ago I finally started moving again and now I seem to be not only moving but thriving as I propel towards success. With this came a lot of learning and revelations about who I am, who I was, and what I was doing wrong in life.  


The most important thing I've learned is to live my life for myself, and find value in myself and only myself. I realized I derive personal self worth through my relationships with others (both friends and bf/gf relationships) and it caused major issues when those relationships went south, so I decided to fix it. I identified what I wanted in my own life, what would make me happy, and started taking steps towards whatever I needed to do to accomplish those desires. It's been amazing to see how doing this almost immediately changes your emotional state, world view, and personal happiness."

We went to six flags astroworld (Houston, Tx) when I was a small child, my mom and little brother had never been on a rollercoaster as my mom's terrified of extreme hights and little brother was very young, so when we went on one they would stay behind. Well mom talked herself up into going and the two of them got in line for it, mom was still terrified but trying to swallow it.   


Carts filled up and they wound up being the very next people in line when suddenly the cart they almost got on gets stuck at the very peak of the first loop, entire ride shuts down and people are dangling upside down on the coaster. They hung there for a good while until people were able to get the cart back down, then the passengers had to exit the coaster and slowly walk their way along the track back to the nearest spot they could get off.

story: One of my early jobs was at JC penny, shifts changed every week so you never knew what your next weeks schedule looked like until you had it. One day I saw that I was closing and thus went in at like 5pm. I get there and go to clock in and the clock in machine thing wouldn't take my code and kept throwing an error. 

I went to my supervisor and asked if it's acting up, nope, told her i cant get it to clock me in and she said np she'll take care of it. I go to the registers and start working and in minutes I noticed a copy of the schedule and when looking at it suddenly realized- it doesn't say I was closing, it said I was -opening-

I guess I looked at the date wrong and thus came in like 5-6 hours late for my shift. I started to panic because I immediately realized I just told my supervisor I couldn't clock in and at this very moment she's back there logging me in...shes going to notice the problem and I'm going to be SO screwed.

She never said a thing and literally nothing happened, but there's no way she didn't notice when logging me in im sure. My theory is she saw it but didn't do anything because she was fond of me to the point that I wondered if she actually is attracted to me. I noticed a couple months into the job she started saying things that could be considered flirting, commenting on how good I look in x shirt, complimenting the way I hold myself- ""I bet you're a great dancer"" (I'm not, at all. terrible.), always having me help her do things she clearly doesn't need help for when we're doing the crappier parts of the job, etc

She left a few months later because of a falling out with her vs various other management and later I would find out one of the last things she did was sign me off of my probation period and gave me a fairly large raise without telling me anything about it"
