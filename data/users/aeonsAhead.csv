gamingsuggestions,fedd9ui,t3_eokgws,1579008258.0,"Played Dark Souls for the first time a few days ago. After the intro part, I started running to the skeletons and just got my ass kicked. I heard the game was hard but that was ridiculous. I think it took me maybe an hour until I realized I could take other paths, after which I went to the ones in the water and tried to sprint past them because I couldn't touch them. Found the thing that let me touch them, ran out of it, didn't know what to do again. Found the right path finally, killed the boss, found the bonfire finally, bot not after wrestling with a dragon and a rhino that took all my xp. Anyone seeing any of that would have pegged me for a fucking idiot.

Keep telling yourself the story of how you have low cognition and how it interferes with gaming and your daily life, and eventually you'll start to believe it. There is no reason to create these imaginary limits on yourself, regardless of what real world experience tells you. Maybe online gaming makes you anxious, maybe key mappings in games are different from your intuition, maybe failing makes you more frustrated than others, and maybe even the idea of failing makes you perform poorly. Stop saying this and this immutable fact is why I am the way I am, no one is like that. There are people with 1 hand reaching tops of ladders in competitive games, people with learning disabilities as well. 

You don't want a game with progression or that requires you to improve at the game to progress, or games that are too complex to figure out off the bat, that's fine, play Sims or watch some netflix, but drop the defeatist attitude and self-pity(sorry) as your reason for not trying for more than a few hours. Finally understanding something or getting something after struggling and failing with it is a large part of what makes anything enjoyable. Allow yourself to be absolutely trash, a complete moron at something and see if you can't figure something out anyway. Don't wanna play online games because there's a lot more pressure to figure things out fast, that's fine, a lot of people dislike that myself included, but don't shy away from every single challenge because you've already decided it's too much for you.

I suggest finding some puzzle games. Get stuck, for days if you have to, then see if you can't figure it out eventually. Look up the answer and move on to the next one if you find you just can't progress."
summonerschool,fed3eq4,t3_eofwis,1578996831.0,"On riven you become crazy squishy. If you are stomping it can be worth but you are really playing with death. One CC and you're gone if they have more than 3 ppl. It's mostly great for the build path. Coming back to lane with a BF sword makes you hit hard. Black Cleaver is definitely the strongest build still but ER can be fun and help snowball. It's kind of like Lethality Riven, but with more DPS and less raw burst."

I mean, they do, but by the time ARAMing mid comes around they are already ridiculously far ahead that they can do whatever. Primarily they are talking about laning. How they position, wasting abilities, not managing the wave, not tracking the jungler, not backing when they need to, and so on. Go watch a challenger player smurf in gold and watch how the enemy's mental is completely gone before laning phase is over."

In truth, Ornn had been busted long before that, being able to essentially 100-0(or close enough) a squishy after level 6 while keeping them stunlocked. I don't despise the lane as I despise Renekton after all his buffs or a Mordekaiser with hands, it's playable, but it's not winnable."

summonerschool,fe7sm2x,t3_eo382l,1578918795.0,"You kinda seem like you've already made up your mind. Meta and balance aside as I don't think those are really helpful, I've got a few thoughts on the game thus far.

Dragons aren't really that strong as a single buff(stacking the same buff and souls are a different beast), so keep that in mind. I think now more than ever that there's a bunch of both invisible power and also perceived invisible power(drakes) it's increasingly important to give as little as possible. Soloing drakes is quite easy for a lot of junglers, and if you are stronger in the matchup and/or has backup from your lanes, I feel you should never allow the enemy jungler to sneak it.

Playing around strong lanes hasn't changed, but you also need to know whether or not it will actually result in anything other than kills. No reason to get your Garen ahead if he'll never get on top of the enemy ADC and he is facing a matchup where the enemy can still farm and outscale. My experience so far tells me a strong jungle matchup with a focus on controlling the enemy jungler with counterganking and invading has had the most success which is different from the gank spamming from season 9. You'll be underleveled, but knocking down the towers and start controlling the enemy jungle is very powerful. It has always been like that, but now if you get your solos ahead, it also means due to increased solo XP that the enemy solos will be even further behind if you and your team are pressing your leads correctly, as there will be a bigger gap when the enemy laner loses waves of XP to tower and your laner does not. Thus, mid-game has become increasingly important, and I find that even with a scaling comp, it's very difficult to recover from a poor mid-game, however if the enemy is ahead you know they'll want to push their advantage and that's where they might open themselves up to mistakes which can really swing the game back from being behind in early game.

If I were to give a single advice on what to focus on, it would be lane states. Read minion waves instantly, learn what it means for the current matchup in its current state, and try to gauge if your laners need you to cover for a gank while they shove a wave under tower, or maybe even help them shove. In both cases, you can soak xp and your laners will probably thank you at your elo. Likewise in the mid-game, you'll want to try to match the rhythm of your pushing laners so you can maintain good sidelanes by having them crash. Don't hyper-focus on taking down tier 2's as sometimes it's much more valuable to deny the minions to tower and get a decent bounce back to your side. Another reason for this is, that sidelane tier 2's are extremely difficult to defend in baron sieges and leaving them up till then has almost no detriment to your team. It also forces the enemy to rotate more frequently by not just being able to wait in base to pick up the farm.

Camping bot can be crucial in some games, but it's not the only way to win early game, and I think tunnel-visioning on it and over-forcing is where you'll quickly open yourself up to a mid or sometimes top response if those are losing on your side. Depending on your champion and the bot lane matchup, pulling off successful ganks is either very easily fended off by their duo, or it forces a massive overextension which is easily punished by a countergank. 

Season 6 was a long time ago, and the game is largely the same in many areas, but also a completely different beast in others. Ability to adapt your strategy and change your decisions as the game progresses seem to be more key than any one winning strategy, but that's mostly just my opinion."
leagueoflegends,fe7beib,t1_fe6tnqp,1578912462.0,"What actually surprises me here is that support is more likely to get their primary role than top/jng, even up into diamond. From plat to diamond I never, literally never, experience getting autofilled as top primary, yet I sometimes get supports that are autofilled to another role. I wonder if this data is reliable or if it's sampling from another region than my own, though AFAIK the western servers pretty much share trends when it comes to role prio. Could also be that there's a trend between primaries and secondaries with top primaries being more likely to go top/jng whereas supp might be more inclined to supp/mid if they are hardcore support mains."
leagueoflegends,fe6q2lx,t1_fe6o95d,1578900113.0,"I get enough ADC mains with terrible decision making that getting an autofilled ADC never feels that much different. As long as their mechanics are half decent and doesn't hard int the lane the game always feels like you can carry it. Autofilled jungler used to be the worst thing last season because your solo lanes are effectively playing 1v2 if against a jungle main. It's not as bad this season since if you are better than your lane opponent, you can get a big lead on both, essentially making you gank immune. 

I guess in conclusion with the importance of drakes, roaming mids being meta and teamfighting having way more importance over splitting the map, autofilled ADC is probably still the worst, but a good supp can carry them. It's much harder to carry an autofilled supp from the ADC role, even worse is if they are playing something like thresh who are constantly jebaiting their team with piss poor engages."
MtF,fe0xe3w,t1_fdyijc5,1578819810.0,"Thanks for this. I don't know if I'm coming across as selfish, entitled, hostile, self-pitying or all of the above, but that wasn't really my intention. I constantly feel like no one wants to touch me with a 10-foot pole, so seeing that same reaction here made me a little defensive. 

I'm trying not to remain a victim and lament my situation for too long. I just seem to be stuck in a mental loop where if I try to ignore all the negative thoughts and beliefs that pop into my head and try to move forward despite of them, I start dissociating and my panic disorder and anxiety comes back, but if I acknowledge it then it consumes me and I feel I can no longer go on living with the pain.

I definitely do not doubt whether I should be on hormones or not. I waited 10 months to get it through official channels so I had plenty of time to rethink it. I think I just always thought getting HRT would be like some promised land where I would finally feel a little bit of peace, like I was finally on my way, and I didn't expect to be hit with so much grief and sadness. Maybe that is also just part of the process.

In many ways I guess I am going through the 5 stages of grief(should probably take that up with my therapist), and I guess stuck in the bargaining phase right now, but unlike grief over an inevitable loss, what I'm bargaining for does have a chance to come true. That maybe with some luck, patience, dedication and a lot of money, I can get somewhat close to looking like a real girl or at the very least be satisfied with who I am both inside and out. Then, when I think about all the things I have to do and go through to convince everyone and myself that I AM a real girl, I feel fake for wanting it, after all, a real girl wouldn't have to go through all that just for others to see her and treat her like one. I wish I could intuitively understand gender the way non-binaries think about it(I imagine) with blurred lines and you can be anywhere you'd want to be, but my mind seems to be stuck in this idea of womanhood as being something sacred and I'm not allowed to be a part of it. The weird thing is, this only applies to myself, not all trans women. I see all trans women as women, just not myself.

That was a lot of rambling, sorry for treating this like a heart dump. If you read it, thank you, if not, no worries."

You most likely have massive issues in midgame as most do in your elo, and on a champ like talon that is insanely important as that's where you want the game to be over. Analyze your laning and your decision making. Why do you die? Do you know where the jungler is? You get a kill bot lane, great, but what did it cost? was there a better play to make? You don't have to answer all those questions at once, but reasoning your way to the correct answer is what will help you improve your decision making - not someone else telling you what is correct or not."

Then we have Garen and Lux who are stuck between trying to change their legacy for the better or abandon it entirely, best exemplified by Lux and her need to hide her magic.

The 100m dash is notorious for whenever a new record was set, the entire field would move up with it, and every time everyone thought: ""OK, this is as a fast as a human being can sprint"", and they were proven wrong again and again.

GetMotivated,fddgc1i,t1_fdd64l4,1578311035.0,"You are taking about objective reality vs. perception and collective reality consensus. This ain't about that, chief. Plenty of people are not living a fulfilling life by being true to who they really are, mostly because they don't know, and instead are trying to be what everyone else wants them to be. you can make the argument that if they are trying to be someone else, wouldn't that be who they are, or at least assimilate that over time, but in truth there are a lot of things we can't change about ourselves. How we think, how we look, how we feel about the people around us and how we feel about ourselves, and we can put on airs as much as we want but that doesn't change some very fundamental things about ourselves. 

For decades I tried to be what i thought everyone wanted me to be and I made a lot of friends and no enemies that way. Now that I've realized that the only way to get out of my depression is being my true self, but I also know that will make a lot of people avoid me or outright hate me for simply existing."
leagueoflegends,fdddt8r,t1_fddc48m,1578307571.0,"Most champions with dashes need them to dodge her Q and W. Most champions with dashes that go in toplane also have long CDs on their dash, nearing or surpassing 16 seconds, basically meaning every time illaoi Es they respond with a dash and it's back to status quo where illaoi gets to slap people from range because they no longer have their dash to engage."
leagueoflegends,fdddo14,t1_fddcf62,1578307360.0,"yeah he had issues post-laning phase, but I'd rather they address that than gut the mechanic entirely. Imo there's a lot they could have done to mitigate his lack of soul farming mid game."
leagueoflegends,fddands,t1_fdd7y38,1578302806.0,"Simply biding your time and you can hit 100% of your Es on dashless champions. And even if you miss, the CD is so short it doesn't matter. Sidestepping it is near-impossible due to the width of the skillshot."
leagueoflegends,fddaheq,t1_fdd45iu,1578302551.0,That's actually the part I'm sad they removed. It really played into the master tactician element where you'd find opportunities to harvest souls during laning phase to give you a strategic advantage in a 1v2 or 2v2 later on. It gave his kit a strong sense of intent.
leagueoflegends,fddadvi,t1_fdd6bh8,1578302407.0,"Sure, if you got hit by the E when Illaoi has her tentacles set up and is in a good position, but play the lane right up till the point where she lands an E and most can fight back by simply not positioning so she hits both you and the vessel with her abilities. At least before there was a reliable punish for an Illaoi that blows all her cooldowns on the vessel."
leagueoflegends,fdd9xsf,t3_ekp5wg,1578301743.0,"Diana was probably the last champion that had a huge identity crisis in terms of her kit and what she wanted to accomplish. The only one I could possibly think of that has somewhat similar issues is fiddlesticks, but he is getting a rework soon. Other than that it's mostly modernizing certain champions who have 1 ability spread out to more than one button(Rammus, Amumu), left horribly disfigured after rework attempts(Ryze, Quinn) or has an identity that probably shouldn't exist in the game at all(Vladimir).

On a sidenote, I'd love it if they could get another pass at Shen. The spirit blade thing is such a weird and telegraphed mechanic and isn't really part of what makes him fun to play."

leagueoflegends,fd99fu4,t1_fd8ae23,1578230257.0,"[Interesting.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/e3/Neeko_036.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20181119203743) Especially considering the amount of time passed between development of both champions. I honestly don't know how I'd feel about her being trans, as I can definitely see the point of it being superfluous and the pushback it could cause. DZK was always aggressively pushing LGBT rights, and while that's all well and great in a vacuum, it's a double edged sword as he is not on the receiving end on the pushback. Speaking for a minority you are not a part of can be detrimental to the minority on which behalf you speak and can make them come across as violent and fanatic. It's a common talking point against trans people that their existence is a political statement(I know, it's ridiculous), and ironically, having an aggressive ally like DZK fans the fires in that debate, while most who are concerned would rather avoid the drama all together and just live their lives in peace.

Still, I'll maintain a headcannon that Taliyah is trans."
leagueoflegends,fd92um7,t1_fd91kte,1578227608.0,"no problem. ""Officially"" I believe the term doublecast is referred to cancels where they completely overlap facilitated by Eing first. Everything else are just normal animation cancels. It's a little pedantic, though there is a difference in the underlying mechanic. It got a bit confusing since the guy you were arguing with was also wrong."
leagueoflegends,fd8f41p,t1_fd7qik5,1578217644.0,"The reason he's saying it's not a double cast is because you can do the exact same cancel without E. It's exactly the same as the Tiamat>W cancel, only with R instead. Try using it without E and see if there's any notable difference. If it was a true doublecast like the the E>WQ, then the stun would come out instantly, but the W stun is delayed until a portion of the R activation animation is played."

GetMotivated,fctz0gb,t1_fctwjq5,1577966500.0,"You are at most a fleeting thought in someone else's head. Most people don't give a shit about you, how you look or what you're doing. Your anxiety is a story you tell yourself on a loop, imagining what everyone else is thinking. It's your mind bracing for an impact that never arrives. It can be difficult to overcome it through a simple realization, so instead it's something you have to work to improve upon like a skill. Exposure therapy is just that: practicing uncomfortable situations and realize that nothing bad happened, and even if it did, it didn't kill you.

 Most people aren't big enough assholes to start harassing you in a public space because they know they are the ones who'll look bad in that situation."

asktransgender,fchyymu,t1_fchv5x4,1577655772.0,"Thanks. I guess a lot of it comes from me not being myself and I feel everything is reminding me of that. Forcing myself to talk in a higher pitch, putting on some different clothes and telling everyone to use a different name doesn't feel like myself, it feels like pretending. I feel like hormones and whatever they can still do for me will only be a consolation prize. I thought that maybe when I started hormones it would all somehow feel real, but it somehow feels even less so. Anything related to social transitioning: clothes, makeup, voice, pronouns, names, it's not really something I'm looking forward to. I don't feel anything about it, really, unless I have the body to match. If hormones do close to nothing for me physically, I might never transition at all.

I'm glad that I'm able to cry again though, if I would look for a silver lining. I haven't been this sad in forever, but I much prefer it over feeling nothing and being completely dissociated."
asktransgender,fcaz4od,t1_fcaxh22,1577579479.0,"Now that you mention it, I might be a little calmer. In any case, I no longer have anxiety attacks which I was starting to fear was gonna be a regular thing. Maybe it's because I'm in constant physical pain that I don't notice any ""positives"" yet. Still, everyone's talking like they found the door to Narnia and I was wondering what all the fuss was about."
MtF,fcaqpaf,t1_fc9tvjl,1577574698.0,"Thank you. I certainly feel like it broke some very old barriers. I can still think back on it and be right back in that moment, and just allowing myself to feel for once is so liberating. Grief is a very good way to put it. For me, it's grief of the life I've never had, which I'm sure is familiar to many here, but now I also feel grief on behalf of my mom with her thinking she should have done more for me. I don't think anyone could, and even if she could, I'm not sure it would have made much of a difference.

My dad and I never had much of a relationship to begin with, which is why it's so hard to preserve. We'd mostly just stayed out of each other's way because we knew we'd piss each other off. He's always had a very inelegant way with things, and anything remotely related to emotions not called anger he would be instantly dismissive of. I'm good at talking to people about this stuff, and I have no idea where to start with this man. I know I have to do it at some point, but I need to be capable of having a different perception of him than I have now. After all, what allowed me to feel sadness again, was allowing myself to hate him for what he did. I had internalized that, pointed it towards myself, made myself numb in the process. I need to feel this hate and anger for a time, know that it wasn't OK, before I eventually let it go. Maybe then..."
summonerschool,f2k1zy0,t1_f2jnecm,1570280525.0,"Yup exactly. That's why you often see fights breaking out in opposite sides of the map in the early game at the same time. Furthermore, it's extremely rare in high level pro play that they draft solo laners into brutal lane matchups and not have a plan in place to mitigate it or even punish over aggression. Only exceptions are when teams pull out unexpected counters like HKA's red side Quinn vs the blind blue side Renekton pick."
