My parents could have been great engineers, physicists, composers or anything that requires a PhD. I know this because I've known them all my life and I'm honest about it--but they came from poor areas of Mexico where education was overshadowed by the need to survive, so they worked from an early age.

I was lucky to be a part of American culture, where education for children is prioritized--so my ""intelligence"" was allowed to flourish. And to be honest--I didn't really work that hard for it. Most of the work in school wasn't hard or challenging until I got to college--which as much of a joke as public schools are in America, I know that's not saying a lot, but I did see other people struggle.

And the thing is, my parents always wanted me to have an easier life than they did--they wanted me to seek opportunities where I didn't have to destroy my body to gain a living. 

So, I mean, how much am I *actually* working for here? How much is anyone who's using their advantages working? How do you even gauge that?

If I get mad at someone whose only advantage (theoretically speaking) in life was being born with an extreme talent for running--would I despise them for using that to do whatever they can to make a living??

The sad reality is we are more than ever, living in both. At least in the US; in other places there's varying degrees of either.

In any case, too many Americans would gladly share more personal data via the internet than the founding fathers could have ever guessed. However, it's important to note that they didn't trust the common man to begin with--there's a reason ""pursuit of happiness"" is the chosen words and why not everyone was given the right to vote from the beginning."
