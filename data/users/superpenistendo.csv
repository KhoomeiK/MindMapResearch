videos,feztexx,t3_er0mgt,1579461421.0,I can still remember hearing this play late at night from the only computer in our house.  It was positioned in the center of the home like a tv would be.  It held status as the only thing connected to the internet.  My dad and brothers could be heard giggling over the sound of Blue Swede’s Hooked on a Feeling.  I actually watched the video the next day by myself and couldn’t help but think “What is this?  Why does it exist?”.  And I’ve basically been staring at the internet since.

movies,fctyfy9,t1_fctv49e,1577965769.0,I heard this interview with the cast and crew of 2001 on NPR the other day.  One of them said Kubrick had mentioned this to them when filming but I can’t seem to find any reference to it online.
movies,fcta08a,t3_eioniv,1577936898.0,"Stanley Kubrick had a quote when talking about his movie “2001” that went something like “the second most important thing is that it’s realistic... the most important thing is that it’s entertaining!”.  The Core is entertaining and only as realistic as a movie needs to  and I mean like the _bare minimum_ realistic.  There is a lot of focus on just bringing the characters to life which, in turn, makes the _absolutely unrealistic environment_ that they inhabit more palatable because you just want to see what these characters do in it!  

  All movies are full of lies - even the non-fictional variety.  Sometimes you really want a lie to sound just like the truth.  Sometimes you just wish the truth was more entertaining."
