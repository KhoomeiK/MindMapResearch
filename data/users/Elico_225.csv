bulletjournal,ffssgui,t1_ffrzpot,1580190814.0,Can confirm. I did my Econ Final in 16 different colored pens. Got an extra 10 points. When I asked why my teacher said it was a pleasant change from all the pencil and gave his eyes ‘a shot of espresso’ to get through the rest of grading.

BoneAppleTea,ffeq5kj,t1_ffep2w6,1579859938.0,Because Americans use language that flows from the back of the tongue to the front. Graham would be a two syllable word in American English that goes from the front of the tongue to the back. It thus feels unnatural to us and we shorten the word so it sounds essentially the same while feeling more natural. (This is the best I can describe the sensation of American English right now.)

awfuleverything,fd7t0te,t1_fd74ng6,1578209638.0,That's more operator error though. A lot of the ladies doing youniqe are in their 40's-50's and never learned how to do make-up properly.
awfuleverything,fd7s1s8,t3_ek901f,1578209205.0,My eyes have to be closed before I no longer see a difference... Is there supposed to be some optical illusion here? Also there's no way my family would ever share one spoon.

rareinsults,fc6ygm2,t1_fc6y2lt,1577492751.0,I can do this too. My mom used to joke that my older brother and I had 'monkey feet' though it was in a teasing way. To this day I would rather pick up the pen I dropped with my foot and bring it up rather than bend down to get it.
