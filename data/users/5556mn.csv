nihilism,ff6cy6w,t1_fd6rvfw,1579624482.0,"A few things to say I think.

Human lives are long, and go through many, many stages. A mind that is older, rather than younger, is a mind that has been through more time, more experiences, more changing, shifting, adapting.

I have heard from a person who was a ""do-nothing"", that they were ""energy-sucking"". Which I thought was informative. I thought that it explained why being like that is a genuine problem. And it also explains why you must contribute, why you must ""be worth something"", and how you can be worth something. By living, you are taking energy. And often when you are confused and hurting and defiant, you are taking a lot of energy. Others though, take little energy.

Now, it is entirely possible that an energy-sucking individual goes on to do many great things with their life, helping many other people. How? Maybe they learned deep insights into the energy-sucking natures, and found effective ways to reach people who have fallen into that sort of lifestyle, give them something to grab onto, mentally and physically and spiritually, that they can use to pull themselves up into being a more useful and positive and fulfilled member of society.

Plenty of people's minds go into loops of judgement, alienation, and frustration over this topic or a great many other topics. And the idea that ""they should be killed"" is not a new idea at all. I think an effective way to not think this way, is to get in touch with the patheticness of racism, sexism, and other hateful, ignorant ways of thinking and acting. You simply must be better than those ways of thinking and acting, so, you are.

It is a belief of mine that a mathematician that works for years on an equation, never finds out that it was all wrong. Maybe people will say it is all wrong, and maybe the mathematician will think that it's all wrong. But how could it be all wrong? Now, it may be very necessary to re-think a ton of it. And it may even be a very complicated thing to re-approach all the conditions and processes and conclusions, but all you have to do is consider it a normal process, and conduct it - aiming to find the best thing you can find, just as you were before, but now you have become wiser.

It is also good to spend time in a lot of different areas. There are lots and lots of ways that it becomes very easy to ""only see a few different things"", rather than seeing alllllll the things that you could see. Whatever biases we have been initially attracted to - that doesn't matter. ""Don't take your life personally."" Just move out from the small sphere you are in, and really take in new things, allow them to penetrate the guarded, small mind. You can become so much more open, wide, knowledgeable, capable. It is a process that takes place every minute of every day, and over many years.

I guess I've always been attracted to creating therapy sessions, so that is good news to me friend. Your words are kind and positive, it is my belief that that makes a big difference in this world, appreciated.

And if my mind says ""it's quite the bitch"", or is exaggerating this and that - then I take that as a sign that my mind will not be very effective at completing the task in its current way of thinking. If it is my wish that the task should be completed and be completed well, then I make sure to never say the negative words again, and instead create positive, effective language."
nihilism,fd6n1sq,t1_fd6j9si,1578193300.0,"It seems to me that when you are coming of age, you begin to appreciate all the different angles, the wideness of the human experience

I would encourage you to read and watch a lot of things. You will see more and more how there are many different kinds humans there are in this world, and have been here for a long time - this is something some are wise to early on, but many of us find this quite surprising, as we are mostly tethered to only our study of our individual life

There are not only many different kinds with different experiences, inclinations, life’s works, and so on, but as I mentioned, most everyone is “wide” - many different lifestyles inside them

But I suppose by way of our habits, we choose which directions we will follow

And so now one must see what they do, all hours of everyday, their awareness growing wide and far and precise

This takes out a lot of the mystery and amazement that you experience as a younger human

But the mysteriousness and broadness and incessant oncoming future is still here, and in fact there is much, much more to be found now that you have cast off the eyes of the young, surprised and easily-swayed, to the eyes of the wise, all-seeing (but constantly learning of new things, humble, for one can only be one, not all), all-accepting, comfortable, focused, relaxed, and with a checklist of missions - what is it that this life will do?

Edit:

Wanted to clarify, my encouraged suggestion is just that, an encouraged suggestion, not meant to be a power play or something, as these things can often get mixed into

To add one last thing - I do not see much of what is out here in the human world to be dumbed down. Some things are dumb, for sure, and it can look pretty stupid. But always, nearby, there is profoundness, inspiration, interesting. But often one can not see this, because they are stuck in the mode of thinking themselves superior. Pretty fun feeling, isn't it? ""Satisfaction"", ""security"", ""happiness"". And immaturely basking in feeling superior can even be respected and lead to success. But, there are many, many things that can be respected and lead to success in the human world, that you can decide to dislike, for sound reasons (""Human rights"").

And privileged, decently intelligent people who have a short vision (from their privileged upbringing that was lacking in a lot of valuable life-knowledge and world-knowledge, and from their narrow, unfocused, unambitious vision, due to how they ride on the cloud of believing they are superior to everything they see)"
nihilism,fd6jqx8,t1_f7ayyru,1578192096.0,"When you are young you  are foolish - this is a fact of anyone’s life

One can easily remain foolish, becoming older and wiser is a highly complex endeavor 

“Complex” - levels and levels and layers and layers and combinations and continuations 

Be careful

I would advise to read his comment again and again until you understand some things about what he could be talking about

Do not be “offended”, do not be “non-secure” - learn about this world, develop in it, with it

Learning about “civilizations” is an area that is very rich with deep patterns of many, many kinds - you will learn much more about this than you would ever hope to imagine in your current state 

Understand that, even though you have said things foolish, you are not completely off the mark (I do not know how you handle this sort of thing)

Understand your “identity” is “deep”

It is not the words you speak or in the patterns you speak them

Your actions and essences are the patterns of life, flowing through millions of generations 

Your actions and essences are the patterns of life, flowing through millions of other individuals in the societies you interact with

And you are an individual, here, free to observe your life, and live your life

What insight does this bring you? 

How will you decide to live? How will you decide to be?

Decisions, are of the utmost importance to you"
nihilism,fd6iefq,t3_dzjrri,1578191507.0,"A common situation - that of surpassing those around you

Focus on yourself

Understand that lives are long

Do not take people’s actions as everything, they live long lives, and so do you 

What do you notice about people, about events, about this and that?

How can you improve these things?

Seek to bring out the best in yourself and everyone else, all the time

Do not waste time with ideas that are unproductive or harmful - throw them away

Just some ideas that come to mind 

Confidence is good, and ambition for better answers is good, but also you must be chill, and comforting, and fun, and widely, widely knowledgeable"
nihilism,fd6hmdi,t1_fbx2c8i,1578191150.0,"After rereading your post - great idea, and well worded 

Knowledgeable, very intelligent, ambitious, right-minded

I am unsure about the speculation about the quantum particle though. When I first learned about those things I had many ideas, then I have since kept my distance besides a few things. So I do not mean to be an authority on it at all, just giving my take

——

I guess to have pauses in between things 

I dislike walls of text. I feel like a single line of words can at times have more weight than inside a paragraph, and I assume it is common for readers to pick out a few fragments here and there rather than really understanding a whole comment (anybody’s)"
nihilism,fd6gg9d,t1_fbyllb1,1578190622.0,"Interesting how, in another way, when you say “it seems” or “it appears”

It’s like you are trying to refer to “what is real”,

But when you say “I believe”

It is like you are trying to say “what I personally think, at this time”"
nihilism,fd6fgbo,t1_fbyku6p,1578190170.0,"Interesting take, I don’t disagree. I think I have a few things I could add from my life that would be of interest to you.

I considered Patrick in the context of his life - the generations before him, and he was born, a child, growing to a man.

I only watched the movie once, and it was a while ago. But he has a father of high status, and Patrick works in the common business.

He is in a life of a lot of activity - but he is very alone, and ignorant, and with minimal awareness of himself and the things around him and the world at large.

I remember most, the end of the movie, where he tries to tell someone connected to his family about the murders.

But he does not get understood. So he remains, alone.

When you are alone, that is an interesting thing.

He murders people, but everything gets cleared away - why is that?

Because he is a young businessman in a place of high status. If anyone knows he is a murderer - all the profits and status get ruined.

And no one talks to him about his actions either - why?

Because knowledge is an interesting thing.

So they keep him in ignorance, and hope for the best. That way the young businessman keeps doing his simple role, keeps living his life, and everything looks smooth from the outside.

And the top humans continue on with their privileged status and resources (classic success behavior of this kind of life)

I took these things from the movie because I was approaching the movie as “American psycho” - “American”, “corporate”, “business”

You know, the realm of those social complications in the lives of the high status and how all that stuff goes about

This being a dramatic story about a murderer - but, I think it is common for this kind of thing to happen - the process through the stages of your development is not so much different in any human’s life

——-

Being passive and reclusive is indeed an alluring way of life - and there are countless stories of this across all cultures across all times of civilizations 

It has many charms. So, what are its downsides?

One thing to say is that you become weak, in many ways. So that if you ever come round the masses again, you are a fool. Who wants to be a weak fool? So, you must make yourself strong and smart in the company of society.

There is much pleasure to gain from loving and from killing - why would you think there would not be?"
nihilism,fbya5rs,t1_fby9ea1,1577211826.0,"Also, how to assimilate the natures of ignorance and fabrications and conjectures and beliefs and claims and ideas?

Admitting ignorance comes in many different forms, it seems to me, all of which could not simply be “accurate” - but different ways of doing different things 

——

In my experience, humans do often express their views as incontrovertible truth

I think this happens for a variety of reasons

Also, we notice it in our own minds and communication

But when you argue with someone, they have no choice but to rethink, reevaluate - there are many options and outcomes when arguing 

In my experience, I’ve never met anyone who believes we could categorically assimilate the world - this is associated with how one considers the history of human civilizations, the history of life, the nature of the world today, nature of what humans are, etc., etc.

Leading me to ask, what kind of people are you around?

Are they of strong religious belief?"
