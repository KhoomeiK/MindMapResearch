facepalm,ffaomc1,t3_esdwta,1579740857.0,I went to college in a small town in the Pennsyltucky part of PA. I remember one student who was also a local who could not believe that we had classes on the first day of deer season. He had never heard of such a thing. I myself was flabbergasted that schools would close for that.
