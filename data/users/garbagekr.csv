CAguns,fen3yuo,t1_femeq2z,1579276448.0,"The administration openly invites foreign attacks on the election process and refuses to fund measures to increase systems security passed by the house all while supporting a conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, despite all US intelligence agencies saying otherwise. That is a true threat to democracy; eroding trust in the system at minimum, setting aside potential tampering. This is not an opinion or analysis, that’s what happened. Meanwhile, you’re worried about society breaking down to the point where you have to defend yourself against the government, while supporting an administration who is more likely than anything else to make that happen (although still far-fetched), but can you believe Obama tried to give people health care?!?!"
CAguns,felpzh9,t1_fekpn4p,1579228116.0,"Idiots complaining about tyranny while simultaneously supporting an administration who ignores the rule of law and poses the biggest threat to democracy that we’ve seen in our lifetimes. Half these people are probably so out of shape they complain when they have to park too far away at Walmart and they’re going to stand up to the US military.... But he’s sticking it to the libs, am I right guys??"
