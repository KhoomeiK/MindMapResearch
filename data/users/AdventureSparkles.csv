If you dont have a calculus textbook and dont need one for doing examples then go to your campus library and pick out any calculus textbook.  Math is math so its fine if its by a different publisher, or was published 20 years ago.

Same applies to buying a book, black and white is fine, a different edition is fine, printed in india is fine, softcover is fine.  Basically I recommend having a textbook to refer to, but dont get scammed into buying the latest edition hardcopy if its only for one class.

Having a textbook is helpful because you can read these words in a variety of different contexts often accompanied by graphs and images."

I prefer understanding over memorization so I crossed out any kind of law based career.  I prefer and am better sciences and math over art so I wont be doing an art based career.  As a kid I loved animals so I decided to be a veterinarian, I took a careers course (mandatory in highschool) and found out it would take 8 years.  I decided not to do that.  

Ultimately I looked at what I really enjoyed, what excited me.  I discovered I liked building things, I was very interested in construction, so I looked at all the construction based trades.  I know I am an academic and enjoy math and physics so I looked for where construction intersected with math and physics and got Civil Engineering.  I'm still studying for this degree but I am quite pleased with my career choice.

She has no recall so she can't be off leash in any other context (she gets plenty of walks don't worry, also she is small and low energy so she's fine on the leash).

Im saying this to demonstrate that age is not the main factor at play here, training is the important thing.  We never trained my dog to be offleash and thus she doesn't understand that there are rules to being off leash. 

In a fenced area train your dog commands like ""stay"", ""come"" and ""watch me"".  Work up to including distractions and eventually doing things like leaving the fence gate open as your dog progresses.  The amount of freedom and trust your dog gets should be proportional to how well trained they are.

Increasingly commonlaw is becoming ""marriage without the complications of a potential divorce"" so I do find it strange that they have introduced clauses on things like home ownership to the commonlaw status.  

Thinking it over, Ill be honest there are a lot of things I don't understand about this change.  It doesnt seem to take into account who paid/is paying for the house, when it was bought (before or during the relationship), and for former partners it doesnt stipulate how long they have to claim something like this after separation.  

It seems way too vague, and ultimately unnecessary because couples who want this arrangement could just apply for a marriage licence.  It also seems rather out of place given Alberta's current situation.  Like why was this a priority.

Assuming you take your meds in the morning, then noon would be around the peak of the medication curve (highest amount of the drug in circulation), so having a highly caffinated drink then is a bad idea.  

Drinking caffeinated drinks can also make it hard to tell how well the meds are working overall.  I would you are trying out new meds (which sucks I know).

Know that having a higher heart rate is a side effect of taking Concerta, my resting heart rate is about 10bpm higher on meds than off them. 

18mg is a starter dose, many people take higher doses than that.  I take a combination of 54mg and 36mg (either or not both) depending on what I need to do in a day.

ADHD,fcbb8v7,t3_egt2us,1577584747.0,"I agree with Vcent sounds like you have inattentive ADHD, medication is often the most effective treatment and you should be at least open to discussing it.  There are milder drugs than adderall available.

For other techniques,you are mostly looking at organizational techniques and self regulation.  Organizational techniques breakdown into time management (notepads, calendars, to do lists) and spacial management (organizers, labels with colors, shelving systems, binders with dividers).  

Self regulation has three phases; monitoring how you use your time, determining what measures would help you the most through experimentation, and then reinforcing those techniques.

Keeping a journal or diary which can be as simple as drawing symbols in a calendar like a barbell for ""I exercised today"" can be very helpful in determining what distracts you and where you can make improvements.

The next part is experimentation; its mostly trial and error.  This is where medication can come in; the same way you determine which strategies work best is also how you figure out medication.  You try something out, see if it works, if it really doesn't work then try something new, if it kind of works then modify it a bit until you get the desired result.

Things you can try include: setting alarms and using productivity apps (I recommend 'Forest', which grows a tree so long as you dont open any other apps), having a study buddy who you report your progress to, marking down your progress at regular intervals and a work-break system (like the pomodoro system).

Finally you have to maintain it, which means continually adjusting what you do to keep up with life's changes.  Incentives are helpful, but you will see what works.  

Having a therapist is a very good start, its a good idea to keep in touch with her and keep her posted on what you have tried, what worked and what didn't etc.  She may suggest medication, and its a discussion that is worth having, medication isn't a perfect fix, its really just another technique you can choose to use."
