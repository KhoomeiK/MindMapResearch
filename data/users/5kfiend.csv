running,ff3p6b2,t3_er5pll,1579545860.0,"Are you me?? I have this exact same thing, but I’ve learned to (somewhat) overcome it over the years. 

To all the people saying “just get over it” - uh, not exactly helpful guys. 

1. I started running by time instead of mileage for other reasons, but it helps with this. For example, if I’m doing 30 min, I need 15 out and 15 back. If I’m stuck at a light for about a minute, I just run 30 seconds further out and then I’ve made up that minute and will have run for 30 min total that day. 

2. Remember that especially for short breaks, like tying your shoe, your heart rate is going to stay pretty elevated. Your body is still working. 

3. I’ve PR’d and even won races where I took a walk break. I tell myself, do those not count because I took a break? They very much do count, reminding myself of that helps me with my mentality on other runs. 

Just a few ideas, let me know if you’d like more!"
fasting,ff0zbc4,t1_fezuhm1,1579473751.0,I’ve run 13 miles after fasting 16 hours and was completely fine. Felt great actually. You just have to get over the initial wall (like 2 miles or so)

AskDocs,femx68g,t1_femq30x,1579271932.0,"NAD. Yes. The flu is a respiratory virus; what people think of as the “stomach flu” is actually norovirus, and honestly this sounds a lot like it. The flu shot will not protect against it because it isn’t the flu. 

If this is it: it’s not usually life threatening but it’s also no picnic. She will likely require fluids for the dehydration and they probably can give her an anti-emetic or something to help her stop vomiting, so the ER is an excellent idea."

running,fegw7f5,t1_fegtb6n,1579103908.0,"Yes!!! I replied something similar in another comment. There’s social pressure to be nice because if you’re not, you’re a bitch, and “no one wants to be that”. I was raised in what would be considered a very progressive city, but experienced a lot of family pressure to be nicer and “you should never be rude”. A lot of women may be fortunate to have not experienced this pressure, but as a whole society hasn’t left that stage behind."
running,fegvplx,t1_fegr29g,1579103595.0,"OP here. I’m female, and not particularly small, I’m also in the local competitor range of speed  (have won some local shorter races). An average guy in decent shape could still outsprint me over a short distance. If I could stay ahead I would of course have greater endurance, but that’s if I was aware enough to build a lead he couldn’t overcome. 

Happily this is no longer my daily reality, but I once lived in an area where I was harassed every single time I went out for a run. That is not an exaggeration. Not just verbally, but at times would have cars actually follow me slowly and then park a ways ahead. I’ve since moved (fuck California!!) and again I happily no longer experience this. But yes, it is deeply disturbing, and it is a huge concern for some people."
running,feguntx,t1_fegftrd,1579102924.0,"Excellent advice! We’d like to think we’ve gotten past this stage, but in many places women are still raised to be “nice” no matter what, and there’s social pressure that a woman who is rude is a bitch and you don’t want to be that! Me, I am positive my resting bitch face has discouraged possible attacks on a number of occasions. In crimes of opportunity, people are much less likely to mess with someone who looks like they’ll put up a hell of a fight back."
running,fegtv8l,t1_feg4jtl,1579102413.0,"A lot of excellent points! It is really important to know what the specific risks are in the areas where you run, I think lots of people overlook this. Like, I’m not likely to be held up at gunpoint, but in another comment we learned our friend from Baltimore just might be. For me it’s safer to carry my cell phone, for you it’s safer not to. A lot of variables each person has to consider for themselves."
running,fegt900,t1_fegqaot,1579102013.0,"Yes, the hope is that it’s not needed but it is best to be prepared just in case. 

I once lived in an area where I got cat called or whistled at every single time I ran, compared to the maybe once a year I’ve experienced it living elsewhere. In that situation, all of the precautions I listed in my post were most definitely not overkill. I am so glad for anyone, man or woman, who doesn’t need to worry about safety every time they step out the door, but for many of us it is a daily reality."
running,fegs9dy,t1_fega9k1,1579101351.0,Could you send to me as well? I’m glad you’re ok!!
running,fegs41a,t1_fegetei,1579101249.0,"That’s very true. My intention in posting this was not to be alarmist; of course the level of danger is going to vary greatly by locale. Some people may never be in danger while running, and that is fantastic. But for many of us, safety is a daily concern and I firmly believe being aware and taking precautions is not alarmist, but a preventative measure to avoid possible bad situations."
running,fegrfpp,t1_fefzq03,1579100794.0,"In a big city in the US. 

I’m lucky to not need to, but I wouldn’t even rule out running at midnight where I live, I’d just approach it differently. The women you’ve seen have likely (hopefully) taken safety precautions."
running,fegqg8t,t1_fefgi8j,1579100117.0,"Thank you. I run almost exclusively from my house, and when I was strava-ing my runs I didn’t notice how easy it was to find someone until: a random guy I didn’t know from Adam liked my run. My then-husband saw it first and was creeped out by it. When I looked at the guys profile I remembered seeing him because he was having such an intense workout and we had nodded to each other. 

I think they used to call it a fly-by, if your route crosses someone else’s, it’ll show you that persons run. I saw the dude later at a race, he was perfectly harmless but a tool like that is very dangerous in the wrong hands."

Edit: ok, that guy may have seen it coming."
running,fegpqbt,t1_fefbfsl,1579099617.0,"Thanks! I also don’t consider myself a fearful person, I like to know what danger is out there and be ready so if something happens I can act right away. Being prepared I guess. A lot of my non runner friends (so....all of them haha) ask “why aren’t you afraid to run alone??” Some people don’t understand how you can be aware of potential dangers but not debilitatingly afraid."

My complaint with most desk calendars is that they start on Sunday. All my training programs are Monday-Sunday so visually it’s not ideal. 

I’m a graphic designer and so I was debating on making one for myself as a side project. If I make one I can let you know? I think there’s a hole in the market for this sort of thing and I was actually thinking of having some runners test it (free of course)  and report back."

fatlogic,fcxfhp7,t1_fcwlgif,1578061568.0,"If you actually read what I said, I said 8:30’s are considered a jog for those people. So yes, people in the front of the pack racing 5:45’s, 8:30 is a jog. The original argument of the troll I was replying to was that 8:30 is easy breezy pace for your average runner, not their race pace.

Edit: yes, a 5k may be considered a sprint for a seasoned marathoner, but for that exact reason a lot of runners will race them. The people who finish in the front of the pack are obviously racing. Meaning at their hard pace, not their “jog”. If you want to get into semantics over the term jog, that’s fine, but I think it’s pretty clear I was referring to pace and not distance."
