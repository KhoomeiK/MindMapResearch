Also, drawing it out for a long time would dilute the impact of it, as the attention span of most people is about 20 milliseconds.

The CO2 in the atmosphere already will cause another 0.5 to 1 degree of warming, since it takes at least a few decades for the full effect of the warming to occur (just like it takes a while to warm up when you add blankets in bed). We need to take CO2 *out* of the atmosphere to cool things down again, and that's a difficult thing to do, and impossible to do quickly (there's 2 *trillion* tonnes of it to remove after all - kinda a lot).

And it's also completely impossible to stop all fossil fuel use overnight, even if we had 100% agreement that it should be done - which we obviously don't. It would take 5-10 years to transform the electricity generation sector to 100% renewable energy, working at full speed and at enormous cost. It would take even longer to replace all vehicles with electric vehicles, and then build even more electricity generation to power them. Then there are the industries where there really is no viable alternative at the moment. Air travel is one, but it's rather small (only about 2% of emissions). Construction is the big one, as producing cement creates a HUGE amount of CO2 from the chemical processes involved, separate to the energy used to power the mining equipment and kilns.

worldnews,ff574cs,t1_ff53h7m,1579582149.0,"The ""crazy"" solutions that will be required in 20-30 years will probably involve reducing incoming radiation to cool the planet. This will mean putting a ridiculous amount of reflective particles into either the upper atmosphere or low Earth orbit to reduce incoming solar radiation by 1-2% (or more, depending on how much we continue to fuck things up). While this will be effective at limiting or even reversing temperature rise, it will only be a temporary band-aid solution, since as emissions continue to rise so will temperature, and anything we put up into the atmosphere will eventually get removed. In orbit is obviously more permanent, but has its own unique challenges, as putting a few million tonnes into orbit is stupidly expensive and creates rather a lot of mess in space. Then of course the reduced amount of light hitting the Earth, although small, will have other side effects no doubt, such as reduced photosynthesis, and other things we can only guess at.

Then there are other approaches like seeding algae blooms in the oceans to suck up huge amounts of CO2 very quickly. Of course this kills the ocean pretty effectively as it deoxygenates huge swathes of water, and not all of that carbon sinks to the ocean floor permanently, a lot will simply be reemitted back into the atmosphere eventually as it decomposes. So, once again, a short-term solution with huge side-effects.

The only real, long term solution is to reduce emissions to nil or very close to nil, and at the same time actively capture carbon from the atmosphere and put it somewhere where it won't get back into the atmosphere for a long, long time. Maybe deep underground where it all came from in the first place? The good thing is that a proper renewable energy grid will have huge amount of excess energy at times as it will need to be overbuilt a little, so when this occurs it would make perfect sense to pump all this excess energy into removing CO2 from the atmosphere. It might take centuries for the levels to come down again, but at least it will be moving in the right direction.

The final solution (ha!) will probably involve a mixture of the short-term, drastic fixes, and the long-term changes needed to ensure a sustainable future for the planet. Or, if the loud conservative side of politics has their way, no changes at all and a catastrophic end to civilization as we know it. But hey, some billionaires will get richer in the meantime, so we've got that going for us.."

The other thing that absolutely needs to happen is far more control of energy networks, so that big fossil fuel generators can't bully emerging renewable generators, as currently is happening all over the world. A large investment into the energy grid is also required to ensure that it is capable of efficiently utilising renewable energy sources and distributed generation/storage.

Finally, better laws and regulation regarding non-electricity energy use need to be made, so that transportation and construction in particular lower their carbon emissions significantly. A tax on fuel is a great start, but outlawing petrol and diesel vehicles completely (new sales, anyway) is far better, ensuring this massive source CO2 is gone for good in a few decades. Europe is moving in this direction, it's time for the rest of the world to follow. Then you can look at implementing better options like more accessible public transport, better rail services to replace planes, trucks and car, and so on.

science,fejrec5,t1_fejb1bu,1579183957.0,"See, this is what happens when you get your information from the media, instead of actual science. There was huge concern in the 60s and 70s regarding particulates in the atmosphere blocking sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface, and thus causing cooling. Much like what happens locally after very large volcanoes, or the much touted ""nuclear winter"". Lots of soot, ash, and other lovely stuff very high in the atmosphere blocks the sun, cooling things rapidly, and so on. And this science was *100% correct*, that effect is very real, and causes cooling. It was quite noticeable after WWII, since the amount of particulates in the atmosphere rose very sharply (war will do that, go figure). Also, fuel sources were much dirtier back then, meaning more particulates, thus more cooling. If you look at temperature charts, you can see this happen after WWII up until about 1960 when better environmental regulations went into effect to improve air quality.

So, if they were right, why aren't things getting cooler? Because the greenhouse effect of CO2 trapping heat in the lower atmosphere is *stronger*. And while particulates eventually drop out of the atmosphere or break down, CO2 just keeps on increasing, and stays there forever. So you get this situation where emitting black smoke might have a cooling effect over the short term, but long term it will cause warming. The people studying particulate blocking didn't consider CO2, and people studying CO2 didn't consider particulates, so they were both right about their half of the problem, but didn't tell the whole story so the final results were exaggerated. There was nothing wrong with their theories, and nothing wrong with the conclusions - particulates *did* and *do* cause cooling, however this cooling is overshadowed by warming due to CO2. Similarly, the warming that occurred due to CO2 wasn't as great as initially predicted due to the cooling effect of particulates (and higher than expected ocean absorption of both CO2 and heat). Recent models which accurately consider both of these factors (and many, many more) are far, far more accurate, and over the last two decades have been extremely good at predicting temperature increases.

The takeaway from this is simple. Don't listen to stupid media stories about science. Every single time, without fail, they will take a few isolated bits from the studies that sound the scariest/best/worst, and present that as the entire thing. When a paper predicts that warming will be between 0.5 and 2.5 degrees, you can be absolutely certain that the 2.5 figure will be the one the media runs with. And they won't add the bit that says ""this is 0.05% likely to happen, it will probably be 1 degree"". Read the actual science, yes it's hard going if you don't have the background, but if you can get through a few hundred good articles without going insane you'll understand it well enough to not have the doubts you clearly have now. The people who study this for a living are *insanely smart* and know how to analyse this data, they know the physical science behind it, they are good at what they do.

science,fejpk12,t1_fej015o,1579182535.0,"You can't do that, it's not possible. Firstly, heating is happening everywhere (especially the cold polar regions) so there is no increase in temperature differential, which is what you need to generate energy. Secondly, even when you use heat to generate electricity (for example) you're not destroying the heat, you're just moving it around. All energy ends up as heat, so simply changing its form does nothing to solve the problem. Even if you could magically change heat into electricity, the electricity will be used, and turned right back into heat. Solar panels do exactly this - the remove heat from the earth by converting some of the light into electricity instead of heat, but all that electricity eventually ends up as heat again, so there's no net benefit - obviously there's a huge benefit in that no CO2 was generated compared to other forms of electricity generation.

Fundamentally, the warming is very simple - more energy comes in (via sunlight) than leaves (via IR blackbody radiation), so the Earth heats up. Nothing we do here with that heat will change that, until the Earth heats up enough that the emitted radiation increases to match the incoming radiation. The problem is that CO2 reduces the emitted radiation, causing the imbalance, thus requiring a hotter world to balance it. Even worse, more of the heat is trapped closer to the surface (upper atmosphere is actually cooler) because the CO2 traps it all down here. Yay for us.

The only way we can cool the planet is by either reducing the CO2 concentration massively somehow (very difficult and expensive) or by somehow artificially reducing the incoming solar radiation. Things like releasing reflective particles into the upper atmosphere to send a bit of incoming radiation back into space, or building the worlds biggest space umbrella. Once CO2 gets to a certain point, these are the only options left for preventing catastrophic warming, and even still they are only temporary and buy a bit of time."

The number of goals the Avs have conceded recently from point shots going through screens that could *easily* have been blocked with a tiny bit more effort is costing games.

Also, fighting harder for pucks in the corners, clearing out the front of the net more effectively, and winning all the small battles again like they were a month ago. It's no coincidence that the only line that's still playing hard is the Compher, Calvert and Bellemare line, and they are the line that's both scoring goals and not conceding many. The other lines just aren't looking hungry - they need to play like the Calgary series last year, where people were literally throwing themselves around to block shots, skating hard for every puck, and generally looking like they want to win at any cost.

The other thing they need to do is not change their style of play when they get ahead. They've blown a ridiculous number of 3rd period leads recently because for some stupid reason they change everything about their game in order to ""be more defensive"" once they get a lead.

* Light can be produced at the exact wavelengths that chlorophyll absorbs, and not at the other wavelengths which are wasted. Green light isn't useful at all, so you can produce just red and blue in the optimal wavelengths, and gain quite a lot of efficiency.
* Light can be produced at *exactly* the right intensity for optimal growth. Normal full sunlight is usually too intense for plants to utilise all of the energy, so much of the sunlight is wasted.
* You can point the light only at the things that need it, and not waste it on the parts that aren't plants. Depending on the crop, half or more of the sunlight is hitting dirt, not leaves.
* The orientation of the light is always optimal, unlike the sun which very inconveniently moves from one side of the sky to the other.
* Light can be timed properly to coincide with the growing phase of the plant, not wasted when the plant isn't producing food anyway. Conversely, you can shine those suckers all night to keep them growing when normal plants are snoozing.
* The ability to perfectly balance nutrients, CO2 (most greenhouses will have a higher CO2 concentration to promote growth), water, and sunlight to get the optimal growing conditions.

It certainly won't be more efficient for some crops to use artificial lighting, but there are others where it is waaaay more efficient - usually high value, low weight crops like strawberries.

With the next ""industrial revolution"" of AI now upon us, there's no reason to assume this won't happen again, and the working week slowly drop to 30 or fewer hours.
