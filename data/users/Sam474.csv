Which is exactly why one-sided recordings are bullshit. For all we know he usually calls her a stupid ugly cunt on the regular but since HE is recording and knows it and SHE doesn't this is hardly anything resembling a fair depiction of their relationship.

That being said she is clearly a bad and abusive person, I'm just saying this recording doesn't mean he is always like this."

You've been able to edit audio recordings for almost as long as there has been recorded audio. If getting someone to say yes on tape was in any way legally binding we'd all be fucked."

Human researchers have found ways to send data through any possible imaginable means. There's a video where they figure out how to hear a conversation happening in a room they can't enter by reading the vibrations of the leaves on the office plant with a laser.

Imagine that for a second and then imagine what a general AI will be capable of. You can't keep it secure. You can bury it in a mountain on a system with no internet access and a nuke on a dead mans switch next to it and it's going to use human psychology to convince you to let it go. Or it's going to blink a light on its case at the right frequency to trick a security camera into processing it as code and make a copy of itself on a networked computer.

We're fucked if it decides it doesn't like us."
aww,fg0y6nw,t1_fg0sc60,1580417345.0,"So I was with you, and it annoys me too, but I kind of changed my mind after looking at her post history and now I can't blame her because if you look at her post history she posts her art work over and over and no one cares, she posts one of her holding the art, the SAME ART SHE POSTED NO ONE CARED ABOUT, and she gets front page numbers.

Like... Reddit rewards this behavior, you can't really blame people for doing it. She wants people to see her art and she either intentionally or accidentally stumbled onto the fact that if she puts herself in the picture people pay attention. It's not like she didn't TRY just posting the art all alone, she definitely did, no one cared.

Of course no one cared because it's super mediocre art and now she's just playing the ""I'm a girl"" card to simulate success she couldn't get on the work itself and she should probably feel shitty about that but again... Reddit could stop rewarding that too."

aww,feendd6,t3_eonffw,1579037255.0,"Hey! Congratulations!

I never WANTED kids, even ended a relationship with a woman over it once.

Ended up with two when my brother and his wife became part of the opiate crisis. 

Best thing that ever happened to me. Both are excellent students, wonderful kids, and strong athletes. It could have gone really badly and for a long time I was worried about where they came from and if there was going to be any damage from that life, we're all very lucky that it has worked out so well. I love them to pieces. I hope your story turns out the same way."
Competitiveoverwatch,fdk2dcn,t1_fdj4dox,1578494359.0,"Why do they not think about this more?!

Like it feels like when they made Mei and Sombra NO ONE said ""Hey are these characters fun to play AGAINST?"" because the answer is fucking no, they aren't. Characters that exist to ""shut down"" other characters are never fun. It's fine if they shut down SOME other characters, that can shift metas, but Mei and Sombra shut down EVERYONE and their ults literally shut down your entire team. It's awful and unfun."
thingsmykidsaid,fclnkm2,t3_ehqjo6,1577751999.0,"Ok I got one along these lines for you, my little 10 (at the time) year-old outsmarted me with her negotiating skills...

We're at a tournament and she sees a Hoodie with a Valkyrie on it and asks if she can have it, I tell her to ask how much it is so she goes and comes back:

Her: ""6sheshaesahs""

Me: ""What? Sixteen?""

Her: ""60""

Me: ""Well I think you already know that's too much kiddo.""

Her: ""I know.""

So the day goes by and she tries a few more times, typical kid tactics. Promises, offers of chores, old barters, whatever she can think up. But no is always the answer. The day is over but a member of our team hasn't competed yet due to an error so we're all staying much much later than planned. The shops are closing up and the stands are emptied out. My daughter is watching them take down the hoodie and pack it away, there was only one.

Her: ""If it was 30 dollars could I have it?""

Me: "".... I guess if it had been 30 dollars you could have it.""

She leaps from her seat and turns to face me, her voice is ten decibels louder than it had been a moment ago and several octaves higher, her face is pleading and desperate, she might die soon if I'm not careful!

She exclaims: ""I HAVE 20 DOLLARS LEFT FROM MY CHRISTMAS CARDS AND THAT 10 DOLLARS I FOUND IN THE AISLE AT COSTCO! I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU AS SOON AS WE GET HOME!""

I sigh, beaten: ""You're absolutely certain you have the money?""

Her: ""YES! 100%! I JUST CHECKED ON IT!""

Me, reaching for my wallet, visibly annoyed (but secretly proud): ""If you don't have my money when we walk in the door....""

Her, literally jumping in circles: ""I WILL! I DO! I PROMISE!""

I hand her the money and panic spreads across her face as she remembers they were packing up, she turns and SPRINTS across the room ""NO RUNNING!"" I yell...

The stupid hoodie is at least two sizes too big, the graphic isn't that good, and it's stiff everywhere the image touches. She never ever ever takes it off."
