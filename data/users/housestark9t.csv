STATS Age: 25, F, Height: 5'9 Weight:160 Goal at the end of the challenge: 153


HOW I'LL REACH MY GOALS: I plan on eating around 1200 calories a day, switching between one meal a day and intermittent fasting. Long walks 3 times weekly and yoga at least twice a week. 

ABOUT: I'm planning on implementing more excersize and weight lifting as I lose a little weight and when I can find classes that I feel comfortable in, I tried a TRX and it was way too much too fast and I felt defeated and pretty intimidated. I'm hoping I can stay on track because I'm having family visiting and they want me to make all their favorite dinners. I've lost 26 lbs since the last week of November and I'm really trying stick to this lifestyle until I reach my goals and start maintaining"

Parenting,fek8klk,t3_epj8we,1579194856.0,"Its really great that you recognize that you sometimes aren't dealing with it in the best way possible. I sometimes lose patience with my almost almost 4 year old and get way too snappy or say something like because I said so, which I used to hate. 

When I do that and am not the parent I want to be I make sure to tell my daughter I'm sorry and that I didnt deal with something in a good way. I will correct myself and after saying because I said so, I'll give her a reason she can understand for why she has to do something. Its really hard and I am working towards showing her patience always. I think apologizing and recognizing that your behaviour wasn't right is a good step you can take when you do lose your patience"

A large percentage of the attacks resulting in death are by pitbulls raised from puppies who have never attacked before.

They definitely seems narcissistic and aren't super supportive of either, and I can see how holding her responsible can be taken differently like they don't even bother with Forty because they dont have the faith. I think without her hugging and consoling him during thay scene I could have taken it that way, but with the consoling followed by the slap I just took it as a golden child and scape goat situation"
