AskThe_Donald,fffe102,t1_fff70eu,1579881900.0,No I’m not saying there is- I’m just saying the whole thing said he will cheat the system. Conveniently edited videos don’t tell the whole story
wallstreetbets,fff119c,t1_fff069j,1579872724.0,Thanks for your input. I’m trying to limit how much I spend as I don’t want to go nuts right away and lose big. Any suggestions on what sticks to look at ? Either calls or puts? And yes I know you guarantee their performance
wallstreetbets,fff0ytz,t1_fff007p,1579872667.0,Don’t want to be argumentative but - not all stocks go up. I mean that’s impossible- right? I would’ve gone medium call but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on my first ever stock market interaction and pay for it later.
wallstreetbets,ffez48k,t3_et2a8r,1579871012.0,"Serious question. 100% new to this. Have some free capital and decided to but a call of SPY last night, short call. I wanted to diversify and buy a put. I forget the company, but looking at the trend it’s been going down steadily. The put price was something dumb though. Like a 5$ drop in a week. Looked at its YTD and the put price would be the lowest YTD. I chose not to buy it- but in all honesty, why never buy puts?"

MovieDetails,ff8v2pe,t1_ff7m7i9,1579697088.0,"I like your thinking. Might I suggest a slight addition? The masterpiece, which has ardent writing, passionate directing and is loved by critics and fans alike? It’s a pretty off the beaten path movie though, not sure if you’ve heard of it - it’s called Die Hard. Simply put, one of the best Christmas movies of any generation. If I might suggest pairing it with The Thing? I think it would leave a playful taste on your Christmas palate."

I really don’t get why this is a big deal. She’s a gay women who coaches football- so what? There are female refs, coaches and commentators. Don’t know why we need to make a big deal out of this? Or see her commercial every 4th commercial break.

It’s like they have to point this out to please the PC babies. This isn’t 1970, gays and women are accepted now as a social norm in the work place,  this doesn’t need to be sensationalized."
