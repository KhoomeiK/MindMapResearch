SuicideWatch,fdhpo71,t1_fdhpbxy,1578427682.0,"Do you think that finding s group of people in the same boat as you and going to a sort of ""Therapy group"" or ""get-together"" event might help?

SuicideWatch,fdhnhub,t1_fdhn0rw,1578426386.0,"Truly, reaching out to them as you did to us might help. They may be worried, sure, but I'm sure that they'll be even more worried if they found out that you were suffering like this for ages. Unless you think that it will warrant a really negative response, they will care for you, I'm sure.

Grades aren't everything, is there any hobbies that you like? There's always another path in life than just academic.

Thank you for being so brave and reaching out, please consider reaching out to your parents, or even just one of them. Or someone you may trust.

Sorry if this didn't help very much."

It doesn't have to be thought out, just genuine. And that maybe share your story with him if you think that it will make him even more willing to listen because ""you're going through it too"" unless you think that might make things worse.

Start anywhere, whatever really comes to mind about him at that moment then go on from there? I'm sorry if this didn't really help that much."

Don't ever feel bad if you don't think you make friends really easily, better to eventually find genuine friends than to have a ton of potential backstabbers, right?

As for what to do next, do you have any community events where people just go to a book fair, or whatever and nerd out together or make friends with people that share the same interests as you? Or maybe a club if you're  in school or University/College?"
