Your position was they are too stupid to make decisions.

If I understand you right you're saying that that's different from women because in the future they won't be 16. So if women changed to men as they aged you would be okay with banning women from voting because eventually they'd become smarter.


Similarly you'd be okay with Michael Jackson voting when he became white because banning the black part of him for being stupid. Is that right? 

I don't understand how it's relevant that they won't be 16 in the future. Please explain to me how that justifies your position. If they're stupid then they're stupid.
