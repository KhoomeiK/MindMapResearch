China_Flu,fgu0gek,t3_f0gzm8,1581111746.0,Lol. I told someone this the other day but in the context of every new case resetting the potential clock an additional 14 days (for the region) to watch for H2H. Called me a doomer.
China_Flu,fgqecmj,t3_ezvwsn,1581022549.0,The shape of air pods suck anyways. Who the hell thought that shape was a winner. Barely stay in my ears.
China_Flu,fgqaioy,t1_fgq5is9,1581020817.0,Nah. Don’t do that. Side note: has the 50mg raised your blood pressure? Mines gone up some since I switched.
China_Flu,fgo50tq,t1_fgo3ohf,1580959935.0,You’re probably right. I’m stressed from a nightmare teaching schedule and took out my frustration poorly. My department chair thought it would be a good idea to schedule me for three back to back 1:20 min classes... Really been eroding my sanity.
China_Flu,fgnubn0,t1_fgntj28,1580953073.0,"You must be a rocket scientist. I understand the base rate neglect that many fall into. I’m a statistician and psychologist so I’m fairly decent at identifying risk. 

To deny the potential of novel corona virus to cause significant harm is ignorant. So is thinking it’s going to end the world. Again, you and the doomers are more alike than you think, ranging from wanton disregard to outright paranoia. Both are a ridiculous, unmeasured response to fear and ignorance."
China_Flu,fgnt6nw,t1_fgnsvdq,1580952368.0,"No, I’m not a doomer lol. Nothing in my post history is even close to that. Both the extreme doomers and people like you who completely discount real possibilities for pandemic are as bad as each other."
China_Flu,fgnsb8f,t1_fgn5pw9,1580951814.0,"No, every confirmed case resets that timeline. It’s like you don’t understand incubation period. You’d be correct if we hadn’t had a confirmed case in ten days. Every confirmed case increases the odds and timeline. Not saying it will get better or worse. Just that the timeline certainly moves with each new infection. You’re worse than the doomers."
ANormalDayInRussia,fgmdagi,t3_ez8zqd,1580922349.0,“Did you just see that shit?”
China_Flu,fgkwarz,t1_fgk8nyy,1580875115.0,I thought that too. It looked pretty bad.
China_Flu,fgkw94a,t1_fgk4r76,1580875083.0,Dude got dropped on his neck pretty badly. I would bet he suffered severe spine issues if not worse given he’s motionless after the fact.
politics,fgkqtki,t1_fgkqpn0,1580871567.0,Obviously not trump. Stephen Miller? I’m not sure who his speech writer is.
politics,fgkq7uq,t3_ez1i5x,1580871193.0,The irony of talking about the opioid epidemic then giving that shit the presidential medal. Lol.
politics,fgknrf3,t1_fgknmn3,1580869717.0,"Oh no, I think I just witnessed a snowflake melt. It’s almost like I can dislike trump policies and the DNC BS at the same time. I don’t swear fealty to anyone."

SandersForPresident,fgkf7k2,t1_fgkf0r0,1580864151.0,The chance of winning 64/64 coin tosses is astronomically low. I don’t believe it either but it would be interesting to see the coin flip outcomes.
SandersForPresident,fgk9gt4,t1_fgk8gm3,1580860392.0,You got a source. I can’t find anything and need to feel the outrage in my bones.

politics,fghrmf2,t1_fghrcqx,1580791913.0,What do you mean? I’m behind. I ratfucked a few elements of an assignment for one of the college classes I teach (two small issues that compounded) and I’ve been dealing with the ensuing shitstorm for two hours now.
China_Flu,fgfer4b,t1_fgfelpo,1580736572.0,"Absolutely agree. Honestly, it’s weird to think but I have basically one friend these days and I’m far happier than I ever have been. I’m 31 but never really been that social and it never bothered me in the slightest. Oh, my one friend is my wife lol. We live the hermit life happily."

interestingasfuck,fge2pp0,t1_fge0uft,1580690010.0,This is my experience as well. Allstate has never raised my rates. They’ve only dropped over time.
interestingasfuck,fge2eud,t1_fgdugho,1580689830.0,Nah. I save 240 a year using drivewise. Tons of companies already know my habits and travel. At this point the question is who doesn’t.
interestingasfuck,fge241p,t1_fgdnmid,1580689766.0,Not sure who you have but I use Allstate drive wise and I’ve saved 120 per 6 months for over a year. Brings my premium on two cars down to 650 (6mo) with full coverage. Married. 31. No tickets ever. Had Allstate’s since I could drive.

China_Flu,fgdqpvl,t1_fgdl56u,1580685599.0,TBH I would love to be trapped in my house for 2 weeks (not for this reason or due to natural disaster obviously). My best vacations are the ones I never leave my house for. I think I’m a hermit/recluse or I would be if I could lol.
China_Flu,fgdibn3,t1_fgdhcxw,1580682781.0,Really?? That’s literally the headline from nypost.
China_Flu,fgdhduf,t1_fgdeth7,1580682474.0,That’s great news. I won’t be less concerned until that number comes up significantly but still good.
China_Flu,fgdgcnr,t1_fgdcj4y,1580682209.0,No... don’t want to dox myself. I work a fairly high profile job and some of my comments are unbecoming.
China_Flu,fgdg6s8,t1_fgdcaiw,1580682148.0,"Oh for sure. It’s mainly because the authors take a deep dive into the topic. A one page article is often superficial, click generating, garbage (though they do have a purpose for quickly informing people)."
China_Flu,fgdfzv3,t1_fgdbgza,1580682061.0,"The ones I’ve heard are breathing issues and intestinal problems. Even if they aren’t that bad, most viruses are easy to fight off. So no need to add the chance of additional problems when our bodies are built to fight off common illnesses."
China_Flu,fgd7cd5,t3_exvq01,1580679611.0,Man. I’ve been waiting on the results from 3 tests in my area for a week now. I wonder what their back log is or why it’s taking so lo nag to find out.
China_Flu,fgd32d9,t1_fgcqz7i,1580678460.0,Good lord that was a long read but interesting. Much thanks.
China_Flu,fgd0b2f,t1_fgcwa3e,1580677863.0,It could be used to treat any virus but usually the side effect out weigh the benefit for most viruses.
China_Flu,fgd05dr,t1_fgcv4tp,1580677811.0,I mean HIV meds are just general anti virals in most cases but usually have pretty bad side effects. That’s why we don’t treat your run of the mill virus with most anti virals.
news,fgcye4b,t1_fgcmr2n,1580677352.0,At least Reddit is the superior social media site.
China_Flu,fgcj24n,t1_fgc37gn,1580673067.0,"If you’re not getting paid for the doomer shit, you should be. Honestly, you’re obsession with the “doomers” is probably worse than people with (il)legitimate fear. It’s pretty insane. 90% of your comments are off topic or something about “doomers”.  It’s ok, in my experience, people with the most fear pretend the hardest."
BlackDesertMobile,fgbkzhh,t3_evrcrz,1580663213.0,Try to get the crow instead. T4 pet is I think is the best but that’s not bad either. Lots of silver or enhance.
China_Flu,fgbc7ui,t3_expsk4,1580660528.0,"I study this kind of stuff as a psychologist (general in group out group behavior). UC Berkeley is correct here. I think there are some valid instances in which people rightfully fear a group of individuals from a known hot zone. I wouldn’t call this racism at all. Wouldn’t matter if it started in the US, China, India, Germany, etc. Obviously it’s not completely possible to identify people who may be at a higher risk based on looks alone but it can be a useful basis (if we are considering protective evolutionary instincts wrt in group/out group behavior). The unfortunate side effect is that many Asians who were never at risk will suffer some consequences of xenophobia. I’m not saying it’s ok or good but it’s fairly difficult for me to blame people for this reaction given the circumstances and potential risks."
China_Flu,fg6pi7q,t1_fg6pcxj,1580573893.0,Could be a cultural thing and general fear of respiratory illness. Though there is a huge difference between last semester and the current one. I’ve been teaching for 8 years and never seen anywhere near this many. I’m glad they are being proactive.
China_Flu,fg6n69j,t3_ex7nle,1580572289.0,I teach at a university and tons of people have already started. Primarily the Chinese student body.
politics,fg52siu,t1_fg52qcb,1580516874.0,I think that’s the point of these amendments.

China_Flu,fg4n5sz,t1_fg4lqu5,1580506778.0,"You aren’t seeing astroturfing. This is just normal, human fear. Humans are fearful by nature and generally jump to the worst conclusions. Seems to me that it’s just the way we respond psychologically to protect ourselves."
China_Flu,fg4icys,t1_fg4fyuu,1580503850.0,No. He’s being a scientific skeptic which we should all be. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Doesn’t mean we should reject the claim outright but just be skeptical until we confirm with replication studies.
China_Flu,fg4hcsx,t1_fg4dakv,1580503330.0,Who posts shit on LinkedIN? We use researchgate.
China_Flu,fg2odop,t1_fg2o9md,1580449822.0,"Again, just speculation. I don’t think we really know Give’n China’s shitty history of epidemic reporting. But it would make sense since the likelihood of the numbers being that close should be pretty low."
China_Flu,fg2o7lf,t1_fg2o3qj,1580449662.0,I don’t think that’s the case. The speculation was that they have a limited number of test kits every day so the reported increase is always around 1200.
politics,fg2nxyo,t1_fg2nr0n,1580449409.0,I could understand if they were truly being conned but it’s incredibly depressing that 40% of Americans hate their fellow countrymen so much that they prop this asshat up. What happened to civil discourse and compromise?
politics,fg2nny5,t1_fg2niue,1580449151.0,Perhaps your right. I guess I approach most of these posts with the belief that no one actually reads articles anymore and just gets their information from headlines. Social media has really screwed the attention spans of humans.
politics,fg2n97l,t3_ewjicg,1580448778.0,I can’t believe his supporters have been able to contain this much horseshit for so long. Insanity.

politics,fg2kj4t,t1_fg2gsee,1580446835.0,No she didn’t and neither did mitt. They never said they were a yes vote. They claimed to be “open to the possibility” which means “we will do it if it has no consequences or doesn’t make a difference”. It’s the same shit they always do then dutifully toe the party line.

politics,fg2fin5,t3_ewdbvg,1580444022.0,And fuck Collins. She only said yes to witnesses as soon as she knew it was a safe vote. Get her out.
politics,fg2dqdz,t1_fg2c0hs,1580443071.0,Collins is a yes on witnesses
BlackDesertMobile,fg29h5a,t1_fg159ik,1580440895.0,"Yes, there is. Even though you lose enhance level it still ends up higher AP."
politics,fg25awe,t1_fg257qx,1580438566.0,Lmao. He’s done this like 100 times prid qro pro.
China_Flu,fg1q8ej,t1_fg155jn,1580431631.0,"Yes, it can be a good marker in some situations. Example, I’m a professor at a large university with about 4.5k Chinese students. They aren’t allowed to live in the dorms over breaks so our numbers indicate 90% of them went home for the most recent one (internal docs discussed by the department chair). In this case, race can be a pretty good indicator of the highest risk individual. 

Of course I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried about it but I don’t treat my Chinese students any differently. In fact, I spoke with a few and offered any help I could provide if they needed it (I’m a psychologist)."
