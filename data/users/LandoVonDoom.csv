About gun culture, my curiosity is do you think the guys with the punisher sigil handles and stocks or that guy you think probably shouldnt be shooting at all (we all know one or a couple know-it-alls that still manage to flag consistently) would be better off because of it? 

Tldr; Maybe the overly “tactical” would benefit from a National CCL practical test and it may then be seen as a status symbol?"

liberalgunowners,feu65x1,t1_feu509r,1579383467.0,I don’t think that’s how the Overton window works. I could be incorrect but what I’m to understand is that the Overton Window uses repeated information and continuous extreme statements that are increasingly absurd so that the initial absurd statement seems relatively normal or not so far-fetched. Beto was pretty much dismissed after making those comments and I haven’t heard anything come close to them since except for what’s occurring in VA however many months later and it seems to be a separate event that is getting a lot of press for it’s absurdity from both sides.

That’s likely only because he watches FOX and other rightwing media incessantly and probably stumbled across some correct statements to make in the mess of incessant nonsense.
