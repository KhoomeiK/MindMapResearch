fatlogic,ffi2u5o,t1_ffcxgl0,1579963448.0,"No kidding. I've been burnt out on my diet and exercise lately. Feels like all I do is get up, walk/bus to work, walk on my lunch break, walk/bus to the gym, do 2 hours of working out (no, it is NOT ""taking selfies"" - I will be happy to share the Fitbit data), go home, eat my dinner, sleep it off, and repeat the next day. 

It's 20-25K steps a day, at least an hour of cardio at the gym and about 5 kilometers of walking for a commute. Sometimes an hour of weight machine circuit AND an hour of cardio. And the scale has me gaining/losing the same five pounds for the last few months. Worse, I'm stupidly hungry. Since Fitbit tends to lowball the calorie intake and be optimistic about the output, I set it to the most aggressive (1K calorie deficit) setting. The limits of the tracker means that trying to track anything like a meal out (that isn't some chain crap) is pretty much a no go, as are groceries that may not be Standard American Diet. 

So, I'm bored with my workout (sticking to it, but bored) which takes 2 hours of my day and leaves me little time for other hobbies, frustrated at trying to track every little bite of food and playing guessing games with the fucking tracker, hungry, and not seeing any @#!@#$$#% progress! 

So I had to stop looking in on this sub every day because the damn fat logic is starting to make sense."

loseit,ffh4ori,t1_ffh3qxv,1579923033.0,"There is a fair amount of fat logic and fit shaming in their ads. Also, a gym that has a bucket of candy at the front desk, free pizza and bagels? Yeah. They really aren't aiming for people who take fitness seriously.

TheOrville,ffh1xah,t1_ffh1cix,1579920908.0,"Garak calls Sisko on it when Sisko gets angry with him over it. While Garak did the actual wetwork, Sisko sanctioned it. Sisko admits as much in the ending monologue. Legally, it's accessory instead of murder one, but it's still under the category of anti hero at best."
TheOrville,ffgudv5,t1_ffgrsbb,1579915305.0,"Bingo. And that's why I stopped watching Trek when DS9 hit the Dominion War. Trek was all about showing the ""realpolitik"" for the cynical, least resistance, lazy option it often was. So when Sisko signed off on assassinating an innocent man to trick the Romulans into war, it was amazing TV (give Brooks and Robinson Emmies), but Trek was officially dead."

Nope.  Totally ignoring the Revan novel and SWTOR in that regard. Revan's family went looking for her, brought her home, and the Republic got some warning about the Sith.

Of course, Revan's idiot son decided to take the title, cosplay up, and pull a fast one on Vitiate, who was less than amused.  And the Republic ignored the warnings, but at least they did what they could."
FanFiction,ffgfv5i,t1_ffg8yjf,1579905298.0,"And that pisses me off. This demand that you state all your identity tags so your life can be plugged into their equation, your rank on ""The Stack"" calcuated like a 1040 tax form, and you are only ""allowed"" to have an opinion if your numbers are high enough. And the ones pushing this have the nerve to go and say ""Oh, but it's about breaking social hierarchy."" Bullshit! It's not breaking anything, just inversion of the classic one with even more arbitrary variables and double the Kafka traps. 

The idea that arbitrary factors about your life that can't be changed determine the validity of your argument and how valuable you are is repulsive garbage and everything we ought to fight against, not just pick out different groups to scapegoat."

FanFiction,ffg5uuz,t1_ffg3mm6,1579899107.0,I am gonna need a bingo sheet for all those buzzwords and a couple beers before I try and make sense of all those.
FanFiction,ffg3b6v,t1_fffzquj,1579897543.0,"Hehe. I am an old fart by fanfic standards (hence the flair), but started out as the twelve year old fanfic writer in an era where it was typically middle aged (and older) women doing the writing. 

This probably plays into gender dynamics in fandoms today. Women were always there (albeit as a minority) and most of the dudes were chill about it because women did a lot of the necessary but ""needs to be kept quiet"" work; fanfic, fan art, cosplay, tape exchange, etc. Now, pre Internet, the studios would have your head over most of this. Tape exchanges were considered piracy, fanfic and fan art were seen as trademark infringement and undercutting the market for official merch. Side note: One of the reasons Star Trek originated so many fanfic tropes, including slash itself, is because Roddenberry was a dirty old man who laughed his ass off at all the crazy stuff the fans did and told the studio to back off and not undermine all the free publicity. 

So, women were the primary drivers, but it had to be all hush hush because it was technically illegal. Men tended to stick to the safer waters; official merchandise, chronicling the meta and history, prop collections, etc. So, the deal was to let our brothers be the official face of fandom while we smuggled our hootch behind the backs of the studio lawyers. Unfortunately, it led to a perception that fandom was a male space (never the case), and the whole idea that some new vanguard of Brave Girls is bashing down the treehouse doors and making the dudebros cry (also not the case. The ""brave girls"" tend to be real nasty to the older women who were here before they showed up). It's really more an adjustment to the Internet removing the deal that the boys run interference because the Internet blew the doors off the speakeasies and the studios gave up on trying to shut them all down."
FanFiction,fffxeov,t1_fffvdq2,1579893898.0,"Not really.  If the local librarian told Concerned Mom to pound sand when it came to the books, Concerned Mom could go home and fire up a web browser. They'd find the stuff the fanfic was doing (which often is raunchier than canon), and really blow a gasket. The ISP or web host could often be cowed into submission more readily than the library. Worse, the studios and creators were often openly hostile to fanfic and happy to help. Lucasarts was playing whack a mole with slash sites via C&D orders through the early 2000's (Bioware had balls the size of Death Stars sneaking Juhani past their radar). Disney was suing day care centers out of business for putting up Mickey Mouse fan art, and authors like Anne Rice and Robin Hobb are quite vehement about trying to ban fanfic.

Yeah, the whole B7 meltdown was a mess (long story short: homophobic actor found out the hard way his character was the fandom bicycle and all hell broke loose) and I came into fandom around that era. It's why I still have a few old fashioned ""we do not talk about Fight Club"" attitudes about fanfic. The Internet has only made it harder, not impossible, for studios to go for a purge."
FanFiction,fffubc8,t1_fffr2p3,1579891957.0,"It was more of a thing in the 80's and 90's. Moral Majority and all that. Hysterical ""concerned moms"" demanding Harry Potter books and Judy Blume's books get pulled from school libraries because of themes they didn't want their pwescious widdle kids to see (chances are, the kids read it already and it was just Concerned Mum pitching a ""I don't like it so no one else should either!"" fit)

Also ""concerned"" types who used to ""out"" slash fic writers when society was far less friendly about LGBTQ+ content and studios were looking for excuses to drag fanfic writers into court to make examples of them. A case of this is why Blake's 7 went from popular fandom to almost unknown in the USA."

The Right Wing version is going to stamp her feet and scream because how dare you show two guys/gals kissing, depict magic in a Harry Potter/D&D/Dr. Strange fanfic because ""Satanism,"" or have a character follow a religion that isn't their flavor of Christianity. Kneel down, kiss my feet, and repent, sinner!

The Left version will call you sexist if a female character has to go through any difficulties or be flawed (Galbrush Paradox), racist if you have a nonwhite character suffer any problems or is drawn a shade too pale for their arbitrary standards, homophobic if you don't depict a same sex couple as anything other than sweetness and flower crowns. So kneel down, kiss my feet, and check your privilege, shitlord!

At the end of the day, they're two side of the same pearl clutching, moralizing, eternally angry busybodies and wannabe mean girls looking for a target who is going to beg for forgiveness they will *never give.* Why should they? As long as they have you groveling, they hold all the power. And this is not about peace love or better quality art; it's all about power."
