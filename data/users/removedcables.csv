TechNewsToday,ffey110,t1_ffcqbls,1579869971.0,"Erasing things multiple times is outdated advice.  Back in the day when hard drives had small storage sizes but had larger space in-between the data on the magnetic disk, it was easier to do an analysis of the magnetic fields to try to figure out what was written there previously.  Now they’ve got zero space in-between the data on disks, heck they even overlap the data too.  Also SSDs don’t store things magnetically, once data is over written on an SSD it’s gone for good.  Granted SSDs need to be over written differently than HDDs since a SSD controller will just ignore a command to write 0’s to the drive since it knows it’s junk data and SSDs can only be written to so many times before it stops working.

personalfinance,ff6hh72,t1_ff6dy6e,1579627297.0,"Except that Best Buy’s card was rewards back, and with the rewards you have to spend more than the rewards are worth in order to redeem.  I would recommend only doing that if you also had another large purchase that you could use those rewards for.  Other wise a 2% back credit card would be better."
personalfinance,ff6h8c0,t1_ff5rhjf,1579627145.0,"Sorry I didn’t clarify further it was any type of card.  Since debt cards were just run through as credit most of the time.  The amount of research that Best Buy has is huge.  Of course it’s all trade secrets so we’ll never see it get released, but I would love to see it get released.  Stuff like using security cameras to track consumer trends,  even customers who paid cash without a rewards account could be tracked."
personalfinance,ff5feec,t1_ff5ax6i,1579590490.0,"When I worked at Best Buy our internal stats showed people spending with any sort of credit card spent 30% more.  Those spending with the Best Buy credit card spent about 60% more, it’s why they push those credit cards so hard.

Instead of feeling like a completely different person edited it, it felt more like Austin’s team still edited it but was taking a different direction.  I’m sure in Linus’s competition if the judges were secluded and had to judge the video without hearing input from the other judges, Taran would have won.  There was too much herd mentality in the judging."

LinusTechTips,fewpvyd,t1_fewn7zb,1579417715.0,"Except that iJustine isn’t good at editing.  Her edits are too random and it’s like I’m watching a teenager with ADHD.  I watched Austin’s video before I watched LTT’s video editing competition, so I didn’t know his video was part of the competition.  I could tell it was edited by someone not part of Austin’s team, I almost clicked out of the video.  It’s a shame we never got to see Taran’s full edit.  I would guarantee in a blind side by side with the community voting Taran’s edit would have gotten more votes."
Bestbuy,fet39or,t3_eqdrg1,1579371383.0,"As in for future savings or retirement, no.  I don’t invest in any single stocks as part of retirement.  Instead my retirement plans are made up of mutual funds which are a collection of investments all in one product, stocks are included in there.  Heck Best Buy stock is probably inside of mutual funds I own since they follow the S&P 500 closely, which Best Buy is part of the S&P.  The difference being is if Best Buy starts to underperform the mutual fund will sell the Best Buy stock, trying to do so while still making a profit, then replace it with another."
Bestbuy,feprcvu,t3_eqcu86,1579328686.0,"It’s because most people pay for it and maybe only use it once.  Then if they have auto renewal on it just keeps hitting their credit card for the foreseeable future.  That’s why Office 365/TTS/antivirus software is pushed so hard at Best Buy, residual income is where it’s at."
Bestbuy,fepjesj,t1_fephyow,1579322039.0,"Sorry I was mistaken.  When I read about the changes to the 401k plan I took it as they wouldn’t allow company stock anymore.  Still not smart to have even 20% in company stock.  If the stock takes a dump loosing 20% in retirement would be a hard pill to swallow.  Better to have it in a mutual fund where your investment is diversified and the fund manager will automatically dump underperforming stocks.

Bestbuy,fep7te3,t1_feov4ab,1579314070.0,"Cancel the ESP and try to max out your 401k first.  There’s a reason why the 401k plan doesn’t let you buy company stock into it anymore, because Best Buy knows the stock is incredibly risky and regulators are looking closely into 401k plans now with the risk of the funds that are in them.  Invest in HACAX with the 401k if you want something that performs high but also are okay with volatility."

Some smaller toy companies went bankrupt too because of Toys’r’us stiffing them on supply payments.  I doubt they could pay all their employees a decent severance.

Also throwing around cash isn’t as suspicious as people think.  Unless someone isn’t paying taxes or is laundering money, it doesn’t even raise an eyebrow with authorities.  I worked at a retailer where I sold 1mil+ a year and so did many of my coworkers, I had some baller customers, never even thought about questioning where that money came from.  And if someone does question it’s seen as jealousy, not something that anybody is going to take seriously.

So if anything were to ever happen to you, your family would get a payout.  In my example the beneficiary (aka wife/husband/children/etc) would file a claim with the insurance company.  The person who had the policy would have to disappear and discontinue their identities, family waits for the check,  then for good measure the family should discontinue contacts with anybody would wasn’t involved in the scheme and move somewhere else like the Adirondacks.  The person who is claimed to of died assumes a new identity.  Heck a million plus dollar policy could go a very long way up there in the Adirondacks.  Invest a good portion of that in a S&P 500 mutual fund, and your family is set for life for generations to come.  And that person and their family lived happily ever after?"

privacy,fejds40,t1_fej1uz7,1579169104.0,I’ve heard from from people who work on high security stuff for the US Government that even US customs gives them a hard time.  Customs doesn’t seem to understand that just because they have some sort of clearance doesn’t mean they can just ask and get information about security stuff from another US Government employee.  The person I spoke with said he spent hours stuck in customs repeating “I’m sorry but you are not authorized or have the correct clearance for that information.” over and over again to the agent ask him questions.

You’ll then connect to the corporate VPN to have the laptop reimaged encrypted and installed with the all the corporate apps.  Before you leave all the work you did is uploaded to the company file server, then the laptop is erased.  Either the laptop is given to a trusted local subsidiary there or disposed at a data destruction company in that area.  If those options don’t exist the employee is responsible for removing the hard drive and destroying/disposing of the equipment by just yeeting it in the hotel trash.

Better yet travel with a burner devices that only contain the phone numbers that you need, and have the device contain apps and data that looks like it’s being used but isn’t tied to your real accounts.

UnresolvedMysteries,fejbzua,t3_ep9yus,1579166385.0,"I personally believe there are a few people who are claimed to of died during 9/11 but are alive and used the tragedy to disappear.  Maybe they ran off with someone they were having an affair with, or maybe they cashed out a large life insurance policy I mean this is during the Dot-com crash after all.  They could have been facing financial issues and this was the way out.  

I have a friend who’s father claimed to work at the Pentagon.  When 9/11 happened he claimed he wasn’t there because his boss called him the day before and told him not to come in.  He also said this was why he had to get a new job after the attack because his office was destroyed.  A couple years ago he died and the family discovered he never worked at the Pentagon after going through all his documents/receipts.  Instead it is believed he told his family he worked there as an excuse to as he was late coming home or didn’t come home at all.  Since DC is over an hour away not including traffic.  In reality he was somewhere shooting up drugs, which is what he died from.

Large scale disasters can often to be used as an opportunity to disappear.  This happened during WW2 with people disappearing only to pop up 50 years later under a new identity.  Now granted it was mostly Germans trying to escape prosecution, but they still pulled it off.  Again I want to make it clear, I don’t think there is a mass of fake deaths with 9/11, maybe less than 10 at the most."
todayilearned,fej3yw1,t3_epaqee,1579156014.0,"There are a few things I don’t get about people who try to get money from lottery winners.  The thing being that there are millionaires and people making six figures all over the place.  You might even know a couple and not even know it.  Their business owners, and one of the most common are retirees.  The number one group of new millionaires are people who regularly invested in a 401k and are now of retirement age.  Your average millionaire isn’t someone with a big house and a exotic car, the average millionaire shops at Walmart and drives a 5 year old Toyota Camry.  But the obsession with lottery winners, even those who only won a couple 100k, I just find weird .

Also not only that but you really can’t get even 20k out of someone on a moments notice even if they do have a mil in the bank.  Not even millionaires have that much just laying around, most of the time it’s tied up in investments.  If it is in the bank you have to wait for the bank to clear to it because they have to fill out forms to approve the withdraw from the IRS due to money laundering regulations.  Then they also have to collect 20k from somewhere since banks don’t just have that laying around the branch."
