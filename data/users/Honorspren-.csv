I just realized I couldn't take it anymore and asked to come home for a while. On monday I went back to our apartment with my parents, packed up my stuff and left without looking back. 
I know the situation you are in very well, don't give him a chance to even open his mouth. Don't give him any warnings, just find a safe place to stay. Get a male friend to come with you after your things, emotional abusers can escalate things."

AskReddit,fehg88z,t3_ep3j8m,1579115899.0,"To anyone sorting by new - I am about to tell you about the man who saved my life. I know it sounds silly, but there is this epic fantasy book series called the Stormlight Archive which will help you put your broken pieces back together better than any self help book written by psychologists. Brandon Sanderson portrays mental illness like depression and trauma induced DID in the books. But most important, he shows us how these broken people are  still being the heroes that can save the world. He shows us that just because we are broken, doesn't mean we are worthless. He teaches us to accept the pain, but not accept that we deserved it. So please, if you are struggling with any kind of mental or physical problems, pick up The Way of Kings today. 
Once you finally put it down, you will see that the most important step a person can take is always the next one. It will help you take that step towards feeling better. Feel free to pm me if you can't afford the book or it is not available to you, I will gladly send you an ebook.

Life before death, Radiant."
