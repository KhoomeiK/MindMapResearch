AskReddit,ffersmy,t1_ffd9sok,1579862384.0,"My story is kind of long.

In university, I was friends with a girl two years above me. Her name is S. After she graduated, we never saw each other again.

Fast forward three years, I graduated and started working at an IT company and became friends with D. He told me he graduated from a university in London and we basically have the same taste when it comes to women.

After two years working there, I resigned and moved to branding agency. There I was good friends with R. During that time, I met a girl at an event named F. I told her where I work and she asked me whether I knew R, her brother. She also told me she graduated from a university in London.

Naturally, I asked D whether she knows F and he said the they were in a relationship during their time in London. Confirmed, D and I have the same taste when it comes to women.

Several months later, before going out on a date, F asked me to pick her up at her sister's apartment. When I arrived, S opened the door for me.

It felt surreal standing before S, whom I had not seen for so long turning out to be the sister of the girl I'm dating.

After a year, F and I broke up.

Fast forward two years, I was invited to a function by another friend. As I was single, he told me he is neighbors with a girl that was also invited and would like to introduce me to her. It was F."
