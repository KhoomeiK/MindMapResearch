I'm a man, so YMMV, but I run through some less than good neighborhoods in a major metro during this time.  But:

* You're running, so I think that helps.  
* I stick to slightly more dense areas or populations.  More people typically make you less of a target.  Not always, but in many cases.
* I run towards nicer locales and trails and well-lit areas.
* I carry very little on me and certainly look like it.  
* I never really look at anyone and try to avoid eye contact.

Finally, as a man, I usually try to give people a ""hey, I'm behind you"" shout when I'm several feet behind them (long enough, I think, to recognize me and realize I'm not threatening).  Too many people wear headphones and don't hear so \*shrug\*.  I'm usually wearing at least a reflective vest which helps them identify me.  That's not really for you OP, but just noting it."

cancer,ffc1ucr,t3_eslhoe,1579789413.0,"So, I'm a lawyer and also a cancer, uh, survivor.  I \*did not\* deal with cancer while studying for the bar (ironically, I likely had cancer as the symptoms were there, but I didn't look into it until after).

I also underwent immunotherapy with both Yervoy and Keytruda while clerking and subsequently at my first job at a firm.  It's not studying for the bar, but it was pretty stressful.

First, the bar exam, IMHO, has less to do with the actual exam (which is stressful) and more to do with study/prep.  I worked a PT job while studying, so it's not as if you need to study 12+ hours a day for 2 months to pass it, but some diligence is required.  Assuming you've done well handling the rigors of law school course work and studying for finals, it's honestly just more of that.  You can do it!  

To that extent, I did not have many side effects from my immunotherapy, so I didn't have problems.  It's feasible you may develop future side effects or you may not, so I'd probably play it by ear until you \*must\* decide.  I'm not familiar with Inlyta, so I defer.  If you can maintain a reasonable study schedule for the entire time, then I don't see an issue.

As for the actual exam, I concur with others about accommodations.  It ultimately depends on your side effects.  Keytruda, for example, can produce urgent diarrhea.  

My personal take is to see where you're at in April and go from there.  Money is certainly a consideration, but if you can continue to self-assess as you study, that is an option as well - you don't have to sit for the exam if you feel unable.  However, I generally think it's \*possible\* but could be difficult depending on side effects.

Besides that, cancer has a mental toll and combined with the mental toll of studying for the bar (IMHO, fear of the unknown), it might be quite stressful.  Stress tends to reduce immune response and so, in some ways, it may also not be beneficial to your treatment.  Many other personal factors play into this.  So, while I believe it's \*possible\*, YMMV."
