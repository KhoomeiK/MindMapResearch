nextfuckinglevel,ff8jxk8,t1_ff80kkz,1579681999.0,Can't believe I had to scroll down this much to find this comment <3
tifu,ff6q1rd,t1_ff6m2gp,1579632496.0,You seem like fun at parties! ;)
thatHappened,ff6prl7,t1_ff64xn4,1579632327.0,"I think that the implication is that the detox bath somehow got the aluminium to come out of her feet, since they would be considered ""toxins""... not that they were actually in the bath."
thatHappened,ff6plhj,t3_ert8kw,1579632224.0,I love how OP is the only one who actually knows how to spell aluminium.
tifu,ff5gc54,t1_ff59l5c,1579591640.0,"The most obvious sign of this is the ""look of disgust continuing"" after he explained it, that cashier would be fucking pissing herself laughing if that happened"
tifu,ff3nhx4,t1_ff3n9mi,1579544833.0,"He doesn't ""carry any burden"", haha, no need to be so melodramatic, obviously they chose to keep it a secret, which he didn't and still doesn't have to do, but if you're gonna reveal it you should probably let it come from the other person, it's the decent thing to do... Or at the very least tell OP to ask her about it or even have her be present."
tifu,ff3l0xg,t1_ff2qmyr,1579543301.0,"Well... Great up to the point where he just told OP about something that should really be up to the mom to tell, and didn't even give her a chance to be there and explain / apologize.

My dad cheated on my mom and I didn't learn about it for the longest time and my mom never said anything about it because she didn't want to affect how we thought of him, it was only a long time later that we learned it from him."
Edinburgh,fexawdp,t1_fetr41h,1579427886.0,"Was about to comment this... it's not really a ""folK music pub"" but it's small and cosy and there's frequently people playing folk music."
television,fetsq7h,t3_eqhgr4,1579379619.0,That bomb-ass TV on the Radio song doesn't hurt either!
TwoXChromosomes,fetrwu5,t1_fesmioc,1579379240.0,"It is very frustrating... sometimes I think some people are simply incapable of it, but I mostly think it can be trained and expanded like a muscle, the trouble is getting people to realize and work on that when they currently have none.

The biggest issue as well is when a whole bunch of people lacking any sort of empathy get together and validate each other on forums, etc, and start to feel a bond and sense of community based entirely on hatred / individualism, that's very dangerous and difficult to dispel and is mostly what's causing the surge of extremist ideology all around the world."
TwoXChromosomes,fesmm4h,t1_ferqflw,1579366835.0,"haha, god I've always gotten really creeped out by the whole ""what if it were your mom or your sister?"" argument, like that's literally the only way some people ACTUALLY can empathize with someone else."
TwoXChromosomes,feslmxt,t1_fepvkow,1579366520.0,"If you ask me, pretty much everything wrong with the entire world could be solved with empathy, the increasing lack of it is the single greatest problem of our times."
TwoXChromosomes,feslaty,t3_eqbqz9,1579366415.0,"Sounds like you should get better friends 

&#x200B;

/s... kind of?"
Edinburgh,feop9ek,t1_feoomsp,1579303420.0,"I'm just sharing my experience, and you're right that it's incomparable, that wasn't the point. But if you want comparisons you don't need to go that far to figure out that you have it pretty good here, and this is the opinion of pretty much everyone I've met here that came from anywhere else."
Edinburgh,feok7ae,t3_eq05p6,1579301344.0,"I'm honestly a bit baffled by all the comments here, I was always aware that people here think it's expensive and have always laughed about it, but I don't think I was aware how much you actually believe it...

I came here from São Paulo last year, have been working a pretty mediocre job and my wife is doing random gigs earning next to nothing and we can afford to rent a flat in Abbeyhill, literally  walking distance or like 10-15m by bus from pretty much anything we ever want to do. All this while having amazing vegetarian options and being pretty loose about groceries, going out decently frequently and buying stuff like game consoles, tv, etc.

Honestly, when my wife gets a full-time job it will be pretty easy to save up money to afford a mortgage and then we're pretty much set.

I hate to be this guy, but it really does seem like some people here have NO idea what hardship really is. In São Paulo (and a LOT of places) it would literally be impossible to even afford rent alone in the city centre while holding close to a minimum wage job, never mind food, transport, leisure, etc, people struggle while making 4x the minimum wage still!"
menwritingwomen,fees5x7,t1_feen3og,1579040060.0,"No I absolutely remember that scene, and hated every second of it... it might be one of the worst and most clichéd representations of women the show had, and there were many!"
menwritingwomen,feeizbz,t1_feeg7iu,1579034711.0,"The show is just SO much worse in that regard than the books in every single way, but the worst for me is the whole Dorne plot! That whole bit in the books is honestly completely different, but the women play a MUCH more important role, and actually pretty much plot to empower Myrcella and put her on the throne, but instead the show just turned them into your stereotypical ""sexy assassin"" Femme Fatale type, and they actually kill her instead for literally no good reason."
tifu,fe6qh82,t1_fe4m7or,1578900626.0,"Is ""toxic"" the incel word-a-day today? Did Trump pay for a Facebook ad on ""toxicity""?"
tifu,fe4lxur,t1_fe4glcn,1578860683.0,"That was a roller coaster, thank you!"
tifu,fe4lit9,t1_fe3gcpe,1578860552.0,"You do realize human beings should be capable of communication, yes?! Honestly, it really does seem like you people think women are equal to annoying pets demanding your attention or something, she's supposed to be a human being that you love, if you have other priorities TELL HER!

""I understand you really want to show me these things and you're so excited right now, but I really just want to finish the game, and then you can have my undivided attention, ok?""

Easy. Done."
tifu,fe4jdt0,t3_enook9,1578859906.0,"If anything, you're an asshole for being the stereotypical ""don't bother me, watching sportsball"" guy... I suspect your wife is probably just fed up with you giving this little of a shit about her and looking for excuses to get mad.

Sure, it's not ideal to be gawking over a 15yo either, but caring this little about someone you're married to is terrible and making a post about it that just completely misses the point and jokes about it is beyond fucked up. Like, wanting to do something else is fine, but then just explain that and say you'll give her all your attention later?"
WatchPeopleDieInside,fe3v1fd,t3_d66j36,1578853161.0,Am I really the only one who took that as the daughter saying the father didn't love her as much as he loved mommy?

niceguys,fdvovrz,t1_fduqt31,1578749844.0,Gotta love the reddit armchair experts... taking a single screenshot and suddenly they know everything about this person and what the best course of action is.
TooAfraidToAsk,fdoce1v,t1_fdnubkw,1578602617.0,"Downvote all you want but this is exactly right! It's mostly something women will use on apps and sites designed to literally be picky about people's physical appearance! 

It's completely different when dealing with actual people in real life."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdoc7mj,t1_fdnjte5,1578602533.0,"If you're going by like dating apps and other shallow places where people are looking for casual hookups based on appearance then yeah, I mean of course that would be a thing, and you're right.

But I think it's pretty decently safe to say that it's definitely not ""the majority of girls"" who care about that if you're just talking about women in general, there are MUCH more important factors."
underlords,fdnzqzm,t3_emcowg,1578596154.0,"Maybe the bat is just gender fluid... dinnae judge, pal"
menwritingwomen,fdl92us,t1_fdl719l,1578519121.0,"Thank you! I don't mind people not liking his writing or having poor opinions of him in general but most people here just seem generally disrespectful of the entire culture he came from, and also just generally oblivious to the fact that writers can be ""in character"" at times, and they doesn't necessarily reflect their own opinions or work as a whole"
underlords,fdku5nm,t3_elve48,1578511218.0,Are you really under the impression this is a new build? And also that it's actually good? haha
menwritingwomen,fdjjks6,t1_fditn34,1578473820.0,"The issue wasn't understanding what you meant, that much was clear... It's more the idea behind it. Physical appearance and gender identity are two different things, and personality yet another. I would avoid judging what people are ""usually"" like because that is a pretty meaningless and biased measure, in my experience."
beholdthemasterrace,fdi16ps,t1_fdh2wjy,1578433913.0,I think you might be seriously overestimating how much they care about actual facts... halfway into that sentence most of them I've seen would be making fart noises at you and laughing
TheAdventureZone,fdhj8ib,t1_fdhhym6,1578423806.0,"What? No, that's not really how it works... first of all, slander is ridiculously hard to prove and this is very clearly just a joke (as bad as it is), and not actually saying anything slanderous in the slightest."

menwritingwomen,fdd8fj6,t1_fdcueme,1578299551.0,"Careful with gender stereotypes yourself, though, that last paragraph made me think you might have some outdated views on gender as well."

I don't disagree with you that most Riot games look like shit, but that was neither the time or the place and would have downvoted you as well. Same as I downvoted this thread because it is adding nothing to the sub."

tifu,fc3ofbv,t1_fc3f3uj,1577394612.0,"The thing is, you don't get to decide what's relevant or not because you don't have a MD... in fact, even if you did, you might not be objective enough or have the specializations to catch something.

Just to use your example, what if you broke your foot on a log, and because it was wood some kind of weird splinter got lodged there (yes, stupid, but just using your example for simplicity)? When you start to omit things, where do you draw the line? It's best to be short and to the point but sharing every detail. You don't need to rant about the color of the log or how the weather was, but share every fact."
tifu,fc3awp4,t1_fc315ci,1577385700.0,"And people like you are the reason why even good doctors sometimes end up not getting a clear picture which leads to a misdiagnosis!

Look, I'm not saying this is necessarily the case here, with a pretty clear-cut lockjaw situation, but it's DEFINITELY not a good idea to withhold information, ""shape"" your story, or anything like that... it's your f'in doctor, if they're judging you they're very bad at their job."
tifu,fc3akwv,t1_fc31tdr,1577385478.0,You really think only one person in the world could ever get lockjaw from a blowjob? TMJ is fairly common...
tifu,fc3aglw,t1_fc32pzy,1577385392.0,"Not a good idea to withhold information from your doctor, bud... you never really know what could lead to a better diagnosis, and ER doctors certainly have seen worse sex injuries, I assure you."
tifu,fc3a9gq,t3_efwd3b,1577385254.0,"TMJ can very commonly be caused by poor posture... I know mine definitely was pretty bad, and after seeing a physical therapist and learning to be more mindful  about my body it's never really bothered me again.

I would definitely say surgery should be a last case. A lot of doctors will unfortunately jump straight to that for various reasons, but I don't think it's the first thing you should try."

creepyPMs,fc01lrj,t1_fc00tdr,1577273828.0,"I don't know if english is possibly not your first language or reading comprehension is just a struggle for you? In any case, good luck friend, if you're not gonna understand anything I write, there's really no point to it."
creepyPMs,fbzx2ei,t1_fbzj60x,1577266310.0,"I'm sorry, bud, but if all it takes to get you to ""develop feelings"" for a friend is one cuddle then either you have some really wack friendships or possibly need to rethink your view on women, imo.

Of course this is the internet and I have no idea who you are or what your life is, that is supposed to go without saying... I'm not making any bold claims that these things are facts, but it's a massive red flag to me that you would so easily switch gears on a friendship and was simply suggesting you actually look into why for your own good, but take it as you will."
creepyPMs,fbzwu4w,t1_fbysvlh,1577265938.0,"Haha, the problem is not with not viewing cuddling as something done with friends. The problem is with the absolutely bonkers phrase ""I can't think of a single female friend of mine I wouldn't develop feelings for if they cuddled me""

That's a massive red flag. Either they were never friends in the first place or this guy has some major intimacy issues, but it really shouldn't be that simple to start sexualising your friends. I'm guessing it's an issue with how he views women simply based on the amount of men here who have one, it's just a guess and I never claimed it as a fact, but I see it all the time.

As for your ridiculous strawman, not even gonna bother answering."
creepyPMs,fbyrhmw,t1_fbyf9yn,1577224384.0,"That sounds like something you might want to work on, if it's that easy to get you to ""develop feelings"" it seems like you might not view women as friends or maybe even non-sexual beings at all?"
