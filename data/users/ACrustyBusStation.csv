TooAfraidToAsk,ffi6qc4,t3_etrrhc,1579966551.0,"Depends on your age.  In college it is perfectly normal, and it progressively gets weirder as you age.

With that said, it's unhealthy (lack of nutrients and it can lead to late night snacking) and you should try to make a conscious effort to at least have a big snack at meal times.

Side note:  Do you take any kind of prescription drugs/smoke weed or anything?  A lot of drugs can lead to loss of appetite and it might be worth talking to your doctor."

AskReddit,ff9ijzw,t1_ff9bfst,1579713766.0,"I don't mean to say water won't be a problem or anything, but I wouldn't be too concerned about The Big Short dude as that was an unbelievably misleading way to end a pretty great film.

Firstly, there's an issue with believing everything Michael Burry believes because he was right once.  In Burry's long financial history, he was right many times, but he was also wrong often.

Secondly, as was shown in the movie, Burry took a step back from investing.  He hasn't (at least publicly) researched the water crisis as much as the housing shortage.

Thirdly, and most importantly, the investing in water was worded poorly.  Instead, he invested in farmland that had direct access to water.  Not because he thought we're going to run out of water.  Not because he thought the price of water is going to skyrocket.  But because he believes that the demand for Almonds is going to continue to skyrocket, and they take a LOT of water to grow.  Thus, the Almond farms that have the best access to water are going to win out.

*Edit: Did some research, and it wasn't just almonds.  But it was the same philosophy that farms with water will outperform farms without water when it comes to any crop that requires a lot of water to grow.*

He's investing in water because he believes the future of almonds.  Not because he thinks we're heading to an apocalyptic waterless future.

The Big Short was entertaining, and ridiculously informative, but Adam McKay can be a very misleading director/writer."

Does she pay for your university?  If so, you owe her to at least make an effort to play a little less if she wants you to.  That's not to say she's right in any way shape or form.

16-22 is a weird age range where you're gaining freedom while your mom is giving up her authority.  Conflicts like this are very common.  She probably just feels like she's losing you.  Try making a plan to get dinner or something with her every now and then."

He read his co-workers mind and discovered he was going to take the money from the vault in the bank at the end of the day, and use the money to fly all over the world.  The mind reader freaks out and tries to warn the boss, but everyone just thinks he's crazy.  He finally confronts the thief, and the thief says ""yeah that's exactly what I was thinking.  I wasn't going to actually do it, I was just fantasizing about it.""
