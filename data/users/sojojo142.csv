I disagree with your sentiment, but I can see where you're coming from. The fact of the matter is that being morbidly obese and being proud of it is essentially encouraging ""Eat those chips! Drink that soda! etc etc"". Promoting that being obese isn't something to be changed is dangerous. 

I'm not saying shame them, but I really don't see what that health nut said as wrong. Health issues that arise from being unhealthy and obese aren't negative- they're facts. You eat like shit, you increase your risk for diabetes and heart disease and high cholesterol and whatever. Those things aren't going to not happen because you're happy with yourself.

The worst was the IV's before the c-section. The nurse said my pain threshold was really low and was worried I wasn't going to be able to handle the pain of the c-section. As a result I got a higher dosage of percs compared to the usual(only by 1-2mg, I think). 

The actual procedure was strange. I could feel the surgeon's hands in me but couldn't actually *feel* anything. Then, my daughter screamed, and I'm a belly crier, so the guy was like 'you have to stop crying so I can stitch you up'. They flashed her at me from behind the curtain, but then I didn't see her for half an hour or so while they did a diabetes test/foot and hand prints and documentation and whatnot. 

Afterwards, I didn't take a single perc the entire time I was in the hospital. I didn't live with my ex anymore because he was an abusive jerkwad, and he wasn't there and didn't sign anything(thank god). So on the day I left the hospital, the nurse told me she was really proud and surprised at how well I handled the pain.

Then, it was chocolate bars. I'm a Reece's girl, but he'd buy me the nasty ass dark chocolate with orange or something because it was 'fancy' and he wanted to get me the 'good' chocolate. I threw that shit in the trash, told him I didn't like it, but he ignored me again and kept getting me shitty chocolate that costs like 5 bucks a bar. 

For our first Christmas, he bought me a men's fucking BRIEFCASE after we had a literal fight about it. I said not to get it- it was a briefcase, not a messenger bag, but he went behind my back and 'surprised' me with it. It was a 90$ bag, and I've never once used it. 

Then, it snowballed dramatically into kids. I don't want kids, and he does, so he'd fucking talk and argue until I gave in, completely ignoring my very valid points for not wanting kids.

Moving in was a huge logistical nightmare, but his family 'will just have to deal with it'.... as if that's a real answer. 

This all hit a head on Wednesday when I was pissed he called me fat at a restaurant **for our 2 year anniversary*****.*** He literally called me fat and didn't see why that was offensive or why I was pissed because it's true. I am fat. But I didn't need him to fucking point it out to me. 

He said 'no' to hanging out, even just quick hooking up, a lot recently, and I said I was mad and I wasn't going to talk to him at that time. He bombarded me with texts to go out for ice cream, dinner, movie, whatever, and I kept saying 'no'. He kept suggesting shit until I got nasty with him, and that's when I realized he ignores me a lot. 

About everything. Whatever I said, he'd grind down until he got an acceptable answer, usually a 'maybe', and then take that as a 'yes' and argue with me some more. For instance- we argued a lot about kids, and he said 'well, you knew about my wanting kids since day one' like he didn't know I decidedly **did not** want kids from day one as well. 

So I broke up with him over it on Wednesday. Now, in hindsight, I see all that shit for what it was- he wasn't a bad gift giver, he just legitimately gave the gift to make himself feel good, not to give me a gift."

It really doesn't help that you all work together, but, at the very least, if this guy is that old, he may be on the out, soon. Maybe, that would be enough to get your man out from under his thumb. 

Honestly, there's only 'maybe's and 'if's in this situation. Nothing is really a certainty but you love him, and he has feelings for you. All you can do is trust those feelings, because right now, in this moment, you can't trust him- trust what he *feels*."

AskWomen,femv50x,t3_eq0q41,1579270434.0,"I am an adoptive child\* so this may not be the perspective you're looking for, but when I was 16, I gave away my virginity. I told my mom(adoptive mom, hence Mom/ bio mom Hence Michelle) and she took it weird. Maybe not so much, there was crying and talking about being an adult and lost innocence and whatnot. 

Anyway, my mom told Michelle, and she fucking *exploded*. Mind you, Michelle and I had been in contact from age 7-12 ish, and I cut contact when her husband molested me. So, Michelle is calling over and over again, and I finally answer because it's 11 at night and I'm trying to sleep, and she says this. 

""Did he ejaculate inside you?""  
WHAT THE FUCK

I hung up because what the Hell kind of question is that? So she calls over and over again, until my mom actually tells her to fuck off. Keep in mind, Michelle and I hadn't seen or talked to each other in about 4 years, so I got to the point where I was out of sight, out of mind. 

My mom is my mom. Michelle is not my mom. She didn't even remember my birthday. Once I stopped initiating contact, it never happened. Then, I have sex for the first time, and suddenly she's all up in my business? *Excuse me*! 

My mom encouraged me to have a relationship with Michelle, but all it brought was fuckery and incredible depression, sexual misconduct(which is why I cut off in the first place) and a life-thus-far inability to trust anyone."
AskReddit,femtuju,t1_femrsnt,1579269432.0,"Yeah, essentially Neo-Nazism became a synonym for white supremacy, which it really isn't."
AskReddit,femqfbu,t1_fempcmu,1579266572.0,"Firstly, most neo-nazi's cannot trace their family back 120 years. That's a requirement to join the original Nazi party. 150 years for the SS. 

Secondly, original Nazi's **had to be German**, although there were exceptions for Greeks, and Norwegians if you looked the part. Nazi's *were German*. You couldn't be a Nazi if you weren't part of some German-speaking nation(Austria, Sudetenland, certain Polish regions). You could be a Nazi sympathizer, but you couldn't be a certified party member. 

Thirdly, neo-Nazism, particularly in America, is more a white power thing than a real Nazi thing. Sure, they adopted the Swastika or variations, and they do the Hitler salute, but really it's rooted in white supremacy. The original Nazi doctrine separated Germans as a higher race than French/English(although Hitler considered England a 'cousin' to Germany), and others, including Finland, Norway, Czechs, etc. 

Nazism isn't white supremacy. It's German supremacy, and statistically, up to 40% of the movement in America doesn't qualify under the original requirements. 

I mean- shit- being a high ranking church official disqualified you from being a Nazi in some cases. Being a German and *looking* like a Jew meant you were lying about being German to poison the water hole. 

Having a disability like, historically, impotence, anger issues, being a career criminal, having parents that were career criminals, stupidity, extreme cases of *freckles*, discolored, large birth marks, being a pacifist, being related to someone that committed suicide- being related to someone that birthed someone with a physical disability- having black hair, being too short- coming from a family of overweight people...

The list goes on and on."
