badminton,fdq6iji,t3_emm71e,1578657005.0,"Strings aren't really that complicated, especially for a beginner (unless you want to be a stringer), pretty much just go to a reputable badminton shop/badminton center and ask to get your racquet restrung. I wouldn't really worry about restringing until your strings actually break at a beginner level. (The only thing you should keep in mind is to cut your strings asap when they do break). A lot of the more 'advanced' stuff is like, when you're at a level where it actually matters, you'll probably understand what it actually means.

When you get your racquet strung, you'll most likely be asked for 2 things: 1. String tension, and 2. Type of string. String tension is, as the name implies, how tight your strings are. It mainly affects control and power. Rough rule of thumb is Higher tension=more control, less power, less forgiving. Low tension = more power, less control, more forgiving. (In general, as you get better you start stringing at higher tensions), You can probably start with a lower tension like around 20lbs and go up/down depending on how it feels

Different types of strings are a lot harder to explain because theres no rule of thumb about how different strings work, but basically different strings have different feelings when you hit with them. I'm not sure at a beginner level how big of a difference you can feel, but you can just try different strings until you find one that you like/is affordable to you. (I personally like BG80 or Nanogy 98)"

leagueoflegends,fdmz94n,t1_fdmvq4q,1578572201.0,"I also remember seeing something along the lines of of Korea having the highest consumption of alcohol per capita(although iirc it was highest consumption of spirits per capita), so i actually did some research. In terms of pure alcohol (there's about 18ml of pure alcohol in 355ml can of beer apparently) Korea doesn't even crack the top 10 in any of the lists i looked at (neither does Finland apparently), although the caveat here is that this is per capita 15+, so the data might be skewed towards countries that have a lower legal drinking age. Lithuania though was usually in the top 5

Looking up the exact statistic that i remembered though, only resulted in one result from 2015 that shows that Korea did consume the most spirits per capita(approximately 60% more than the next country), however this measured the total volume of the drink, instead of only the volume of pure alcohol. Naturally, this makes the result largely meaningless since different spirits have differing ABV, with soju being at nearly the bottom at only ~22%, compared to most liquors that are 40%"

For now don't worry too much about power, practice half smashes until you're comfortable, and then add more power. If you just approach it as ""I'm gonna hit it really hard"" you'll probably have poor form and poor timing resulting in something that's not a smash.

Form-wise like how to hit it, it's kinda difficult to describe just in words(esp since we don't know how you try to smash now) but think of the difference in how you hit between a normal clear vs a punch clear or vs a drop. They all look almost exactly the same in terms of form, but the resulting shots are very different. The difference is basically in the timing of your forearm and smashing is the same, you just have to find the timing
