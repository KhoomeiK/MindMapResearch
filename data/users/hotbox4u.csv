Ok, so a major rework here.

> * Dizzying Swing (morph): This morph now stuns enemies who are already off balance.

So is this now nerfed because you have to do two dizzy swings and the stun is now on a 15 second cooldown? Does uppercut still provides off balance status? Either ways, seems like a big 'fuck you' to melee players. Why even bother being melee in 2020? Unless you are a mag templar ofc.

Good and needed nerf for pvp, still useful for tanking. I like it.

I don't even know what this ability is supposed to be anymore. I mean right now they wanted it to be a spamable, right? But by making it a cost 1/3 more then all other stam melee spamables you made it really unattractive to use.

FTFY.

Like you described, there are only so many rides you can go on to. And once you experienced them all it can get a bit boring unless you really like to do them over and over again. It's even more themepark then WoW, because in WoW you can play on pvp servers which at least gives players some leeway on how to interact with other players. But just like in ESO, the world is completely static and there is no way how a player can interact or leave his mark in the world. 

And sandbox mmo would be like EVE Online, where you can occupy space, build your own structures and fill that space with your own people and made up laws you then can enforce, while others have the opportunity to counter react to your doing. So you create your own sandcastle (content). 

There are also hybrids, like BDO, where you have so many options that you can really create your own way to archive whatever goal you might have. It still offers a lot of rides the player can go on to but is in general way more open then a true theme park game and lets players create their own politics while keeping them in the bounds of the rides."

 PVP balance is aweful, class design is lacking and favoring classes that are behind a paywall. Some rebalances were a fucking joke and other brought classes over the top. 

Then there is performance. If you play long enough you wonder how the devs didn't curled up and died of shame by now. It's so horrendous that you have to stop playing or realize that your kinda get off on making yourself suffer. 

As much as i enjoy the game at times, there are nearly as many where i give up on playing out of pure frustration. 

Combat is ok. Let's be real here. There are so many problems with this system (fE ball groups abuse it, pet players abuse it) and you only start to noticing those problems if you play long enough and vs people who abuse the game mechanics to it's fullest. 

Then there is class design which can be equally frustrating and you only notice that when you have played a few different classes with different builds. 

Just for example compare magicka sorc and stamina DK. A mag sorc has so many options to build because there are some really good class skills you can use in pvp. A stamDK is hard locked into one build with maybe 1 or 2 skill variation that do not change the play style one bit. And then one day the Devs come along and announce that they will finally address the class identity problems of stamina DKs. And then imagine they change one morph of a skill. And that morph is terrible and badly designed. You can only take so much so i understand why those people shit on the game. 

Still, as a new player there is tons of fun to be had. The veteran still have a point. 

But class design and the direction of the game is subjective and there is lots to discuss. 

But the bad performance is not. And you have no idea what the Devs put us through without every really apologizing. Right now fE the game on console suffers from blue screen crashes, black screen freezes, endless loading screens, very long loading screens (up to 3-4min) and random loading screens (that only you experience, not your opponent) mid fight, from just 1-2 seconds to 2-3minutes. 

In the past we had issues that lasted *months* fE where the game crashed at *nearly every* loading screen. And there are a lot of loading screens in this game. It took them 7 weeks to fix it. No apologies or real communication during that time too. 

Mass freezes in pvp, where suddenly mid fight 1/3 of the people fighting got kicked out of the game while the rest could slaughter them. Lasted for weeks as well. 

The list goes on and on too. So yeah, they have every right to bitch about the game. But i agree that it makes for a bad stream.

And i run normal dungeons because it's faster to blast through the normal difficulty then do the veteran version. (Blame ZOS)

I use the dungeon tool because it's by far the fastest way to reset a dungeon. (Blame ZOS) You run one solo, then queue for the dungeon as tank (obviously with a taunt slotted) and rinse and repeat. 

Sometimes i just want to get a couple of runs in and by far the fastest way is the method above.

As far as the content goes, unless you have a lucky encounter with a braindead 10 people zerg where you kill all of them, every decent stamDK has clips where he leaps on 3 people and executes all of them if he plays long enough. 

The only other interesting part for me i look for in pvp videos is movement but that's indeed pretty basic in this video. 

Music choice, well personally i think it's way to generic. Typical hip-hop and EDM music choices that you hear in every other gaming video. 

Editing, i like because i just want to see raw gameplay and not some fancy editing. 

If you include your build at the end or the start you will get more clicks and new players will probably be thankful. 

Overall i think you did a good job. People who do not play stamDK on their own/pvp much will be impressed i guess."

elderscrollsonline,fdex0to,t1_fddggy0,1578348382.0,"> prevailing attitude of the player base is that you’re not “needed” either.

Because healer aren't needed for a lot of endgame content. It's just a fact. They are needed for trials. And they make DLC dungeon easier. But DLC dungeons can be done by 3 dds and a tank just as easy if they know mechanics. VBRP? VDSA? So much easier and faster with 3 dds. All you need is a pet sorc and templar for burst heals and cleanse. A full healer just slows any good group down. Veteran dungeons? I can run that with any DDs and have enough self heal on my tank. Normal dungeons? You don't even need a tank. Only one char with a good build and taunt slotted. 

It's just how the end game is. But Healers are needed for new players to learn mechanics and have a relaxed time doing dungeons, but the endgame mentality (aka elitism) sadly leaks into early game and leads to some toxic attitudes towards full healer."
elderscrollsonline,fdeu2is,t1_fdddk4y,1578346614.0,"So true. I used to run selenes, tremorscale or BS/7th legion/ viper 1h&shield infused. It was the heyday of 1vsXing as a stamDK. You would hit so hard with a 1h infused and having reverb with major defile as CC brought it over the top. But then you would run into stamNBs and even more untouchable sorcs that would ruin your day. 

PVP balance in this game was and still is really something else."
elderscrollsonline,fdd71w5,t3_ekqh3m,1578297663.0,"No crafting is very simple but time gated.

I just make it simple: 

The only difficulty when crafting armor sets is having the required amount of traits researched. There are 9 traits in total you have to research, but you have to research them for every **individual** armor piece separately.  (Tip: Investing skillpoints reduces the research time and increases how many traits you can research at once.)

Research is very simple. You just walk up to a crafting station and select research. You need to have a armor/weapon piece with the desired trait in your possession and then the armor/weapon piece is destroyed in the process. 

But remember when i said the whole process is time gated? With each trait you research for an individual armor piece the time increases. Each piece has 9 traits you have to research. 

The first trait takes 6 hours, the third 24 hours, the sixth already 8 days and the last trait takes a total of 64 days. Again, you have to do this for each armor piece. Now, you can invest skill points to decrease the time. I think it goes down to 32 days for the last trait. Trait numbers in total:

Blacksmithing = 126 research traits

Clothier = 126 research traits

Woodworking = 54 research traits

Jewelry Crafting = 18 research traits

You see that starting researching right away will pay off in the long run. 

But this is only of importance if you want to become a mastercrafter (which is very handy especially for endgame for transmuting items)

But if you only want to upgrade to the highest quality (legendary/gold color) then all you need to do is walk up to a guild trader and buy the materials, ergo all you need is the right amount of gold. Investing skillpoints decreases the number of upgrading materials you need, thus making it cheaper, but you can do it right away, zero skill needed."
elderscrollsonline,fdd5rch,t1_fdck2v6,1578295999.0,"Yeah and that's great that they have plans. But they had those plans before. And i believe it when i see it. 

I'm on PS4 EU and we experience the same as OP. But the worst part is that this is going on for years...

There were times where people would freeze and mass disconnect (went on for 2 months), endless loading screen where you had to reset your game (went on for weeks), frame drops during keep fights that made playing impossible and the list goes and and on. 

But the worst is the lag. And i do not see this getting fixed ever. While most issues above got fixed eventually (even the frames are pretty stable atm) there is always something new. Right now the bluescreen crashes are rampant and suck every fun out of your gaming session. You are in the middle of an intense fight - CRASH; you are in charge of your group and about to coordinate the crucial attack - CRASH; you got the hammer and are about to smash the enemies keep door - CRASH and the hammer is lost. You spawn sometimes back in where you were, sometimes it teleports you back to base camp (super fun when your whole group is deep in enemy territory) or it kicks you right out of cyrodiil and you have to requeue, which depending on what time it is, can mean the end of your gaming session because the queues are so long. 

But then there is the lag. Random loading screen of up to 2 minutes out of nowhere. Bar swap not working, people not taking damage because it's not registering that you hit them, abilities not going off, Ultis not working and everything is happening with heavy delay during prime time. And that shit *is happening since the start of the game and never got fixed*. 

I often think that we all have some kind of brain damage that we stuck with the game for so long and accepted the server performance for what it is. 

But right now, it's especially bad. So yeah if you are coming for the pvp... stay away from the game if you want to save time, money and your sanity."

elderscrollsonline,fcmbejp,t1_fcl19jg,1577769508.0,"No there isn't really one. Normal trials are piss easy and can be done by a half decent PUG without coms. You get normal gear which is the same as the veteran trial gear (perfected version) but the perfected versions have a little bit more stats. There are a few items from vet trials (mostly weapons) that are a direct upgrade to the normal version, but overall it's not noticeable if someone has the normal or perfected version. 

PVE trial endgame in ESO is pretty stale, like i said, because the whole game focuses on the casual player experience. Hardcore endgame pve is basically running the vet trials hardmode (timed runs, no death runs, etc) for score-runs to place on the leaderboards (you get extra rewards for that, titles and skins and other items for bragging rights. 

To push into the upper brackets of the leaderboard you obviously need a min/maxed group. Because animation canceling is a thing especially DDs need to practice their rotations quiet a bit to improve their dps. Healers are equal parts healers, buff and debuff bots who are just busy with that. Healing in itself is pretty easy because of the smart healing, but the challenge is to keep up all the buffs on your group and rotate the debuffs on enemies while keeping your group alive. 

But i have to say, i gave up on endgame raiding after i finished most vet trials (no hardmodes tho) and pvp is my endgame now. (In a nutshell: PVP allows for more experimenting in the gear and cyrodiils open pvp zone, while equally stale after a while, is still exciting to me)

What is still fun to me is to play the new DLC dungeons with their hardmodes tho. It's only 4 man content but actually challenging and with a lot of new mechanics. Again, this content caters to the casual players because you don't need a schedule or much preparation. You just go in and figure it out. You don't even need trial gear, just a well optimized build. (But often crafted gear can be enough for that)

Overall there is a lot to do as a new player who wants to push into pve endgame, but don't expect it to be as sophisticated as wow's raid scene. There is no gear score nor can you inspect other players and only titles can be an indication of the achievements of that player. So all you achieve is for your own sakes."
elderscrollsonline,fcl14mj,t3_ehmcx2,1577737540.0,"The game is *a lot* more casual friendly then WoW. That's nice if you grind/gear up but once you hit the endgame, it can get a bit stale, because endgame gear isn't as important as in wow. 

Healing is a lot easier then in wow because you have smart healing, but that doesn't mean it's trivial or less fun. It's a much needed role in endgame raid(trial) groups and requires min/maxing just like all other classes. 

Templars passives and access to the only ranged instant heal makes them the nr1 class when it comes to healing. Warden can be great healer too, but are more a hybrid buff/healing bot and lack the burst heal. Sorcs aren't used for endgame trial healing because they miss the passives and have very limited class healing skills. 

If you want to be a healer, it's magicka templar all the way. The class is very easy to level with a decent skill build (just look up guides on templars) because you have a great spamable (jabs) and with the amount of healing you can put out you can solo pretty much everything outside of dungeons.

There are a good number of trials and hardmodes that can keep trial guilds busy for months. But unless you push scoreruns for leaderboard placing, your gear doesn't have to be perfect. 

The raiding experience is overall a lot more casual friendly and not nearly as rewarding as WoWs scene. But that's just my opinion. It's still fun tho, at least for a while."

elderscrollsonline,fcjl5yr,t1_fcgupqq,1577692128.0,"Just to provide you with a different point of view for the learning experience: 

All the people in his clips are unskilled players who do not know how to use their buffs, resources and break-free. All his pressure comes from using power of the light and drain in combo with the bat swarm ulti. The moment one competent player shows up and survives his damage (which is easy if you know how to circle buffs, and his dmg sucks because 3 defensive sets) he has nothing left. 

He has 12k stamina, 600 stam recovery and 20k physical resist. He will get squatted by any half decent stam melee who just CCs him 3 times until hes out of stamina.

Take a stam dk fE:  1487 pen from NMA, 5280 pen from noxious breath, 3184 from 37 CP Piecing and you are at 9951 pen. That cuts his resist in half and he wasted and entire monster set on pushing his resis up. 

 He has a low mag pool and very low spell damage so the heals he has slotted are basically useless. BoL is still decent (the skill is just good) but will eat his magicka way to fast and he has no mag recovery to back it up either. 

The sets he is wearing are ok if you are scared of dying to unskilled players, but won't save him from anyone who is actually playing pvp with the a competitive mindset. 

As you can see it's easy to pick apart builds and there is a lot to think about when making a build. The players who you can kill with 3 people have incooperated everything in their builds. 

But in the end... it's cyro and you can pick and choose your targets and how you want to play as long as you have fun. This guy has a weird build that won't hold against a potion of cyro players but he can go against some casuals and have fun with an off meta set he came up with on his own."

In pve, a healer should focus on his role, not on being tanky. Roughly, you need 17.5k health with food, so that when you have a tank with ebony armor in your group you sit at 18.5k health which is enough to avoid instantly dying. This is a general rule, there are a few exceptions. 

More health then that means your build isn't optimized and you aren't as effective as you should be in your role.
