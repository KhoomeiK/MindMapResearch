Its a trait that can come along but we can't control what we are. Im getting scolded for something I fucked up on. Ive seen many kids and adults with varying degrees of ASD with great amounts of knowledge to share. Ill take any and all hate for this, so give it your worst."

At the top youll need to go right into the little white room. There will be a guy there so wait him out or stealthy kill ( I suggest wait) there will be another outside the door wait for him to go past and stealth kill from behind (sneak + melee) go to the hallway to the laundry room. (Another guy who can be waited out) once in laundry room put on outfit 2 and walk out (noose or firefighter) staff lobby.

gaming,fcwki6i,t3_ej66ve,1578028131.0,"Let me teach you all the way of gaming to no longer rage. As I had poor internet for a really long time I had lost to every reason in the book I never blamed myself at the time. As time went on I slowly just got used to losing as if second nature. Now that my internet is better I win a lot now and when I lose I gotten to the point to where Im like ""Good job (enemy name(s)) I hope you enjoy a victory."" Many saw that as sarcasm when I meant it. Now the guide. Fucking MURDER your internet in ways that are temporary. Theres no need to cripple your internet for life. And play with that for at least 3 months with the goal of being as a civil minded individual and respecting your loss. I mean seriously people who shout curse words over a loss, your not the best and there is always someone better than you and thats a fact of life. Console players if you accuse someone of hacking be aware that your complementing them."
