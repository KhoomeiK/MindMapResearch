todayilearned,ffmmhv0,t3_eu5wt2,1580056691.0,"I worked in an office that had carpet, cloth covered dividers that were just over 5 foot tall, nice big work spaces.  Then they adopted this European idea of cube farms that were open and every surface was hard so it reflected all sound.  They tore out the carpet and replaced it with tile.  It was horrible.  The tile got dirty so fast where your chair was, it was so loud, you could hear everyone for 20 feet if they were on the phone.  The dividers were only 3 foot, you had no privacy if you needed to pick your nose or something.  People brought in framing pieces and put blankets over them to cut down on the noise."

GoogleFi,ffi6b3h,t3_etmf0t,1579966239.0,"Been using it for a month.  Its inferior in a lot of ways.  In hangouts, there was a chrome extension that you could install on desktop and txt from there.  It would work on multiple computer and device independently.  With messages, you have to view messages. Google. Com in a browser, I could not install messages on my tablet, so it's a browser window there too.  Not that big a deal, but it doesn't like having it in multiple browser windows.  If you open it on another browser, the other one gets soft kicked, you have to click ""use here"" to txt in the other browser.  And with messages, your phone has to be on for it to work on any other device.  It's like your phone becomes a server other devices connect to.  You will frequently see a notification icon telling you messages are viewable somewhere else.  It's not nearly as seamless."
