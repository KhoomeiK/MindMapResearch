AmItheAsshole,ffcjhly,t1_ffby99j,1579800780.0,You have to be a troll. This cant be real...?
popheads,ffcc8rp,t1_ffc207q,1579796324.0,"But why would they change who actually won? Wouldnt that be more proof to the claims? If Lana is the front runner, would they risk changing it and making a stink?"
popheads,ffc9sus,t1_ffc08vj,1579794791.0,"I agree with this statement but I wouldnt say manic has no fun at all. 3am is lots of fun, but I get your point. The reason I dont LOVE manic is all the interludes. Theres not one I hate necessarily, but did there need to be so many? It's not an album that I'll keep listening to from beginning to end. Whereas rare is a better full listen. 

But I do think halsey succeeded in creating a very personal album and one i cant wait to hear live."
popheads,ffc84b2,t1_ffbou21,1579793715.0,"No way, I love that video!"
popheads,ffc7rt4,t1_ffbhjea,1579793495.0,"Right, it really comes off as a power move to get Taylor to 'approve' it. Theres no reason she needs to be consulted on it, just do what you want."
popheads,ffc7h4q,t1_ffbaey1,1579793303.0,"I think a 30 year old can still put out a fun song. But I think Lover is her most mature album. The lyrics in cornelia street, the selft reflection in afterglow, all of false god."
TaylorSwift,ffc4yf2,t1_ffb7jdg,1579791634.0,I probably havent given it a big enough chance. But on first listen I really only enjoyed the first like 4 songs.
movies,ffc4v9g,t1_ffb7ph4,1579791574.0,"In the first statement the issue with the lyric was never mentioned. It wasnt until the recording came out that her team switched tunes very quickly to say the issue was with the 'that bitch' lyric. 

I do not think Taylor is in the wrong at all. But I do think Taylor and her team had a misstep in the way they handled the situation."
TaylorSwift,ffb6wea,t3_esnsov,1579753412.0,Me!  But im mainly a fan of crybaby. Haven't really connected with her new album.
movies,ffak2a9,t1_ffac2xt,1579737682.0,"You're right. The first statement Tree ever made was to deny that Kayne called Taylor to approve the song. They said he called to ask Taylor to release the song on her twitter account. Once the videos came out they released another statement. What kanye and kim did is still totally shady and they released the call all spliced up to make it look worse. But Taylor's initial statement was not completely truthful.

I'm a huge Swiftie, I'll be the first to defend her in anything.

movies,ff9qtl8,t1_ff9l7mx,1579718982.0,Apparently neither do you.
movies,ff9qo68,t1_ff9pdj5,1579718866.0,"What you said is correct,  that is what happened. But the first statement her team made, was that she was never contacted by Kanye. Then she made the statement that she was, but was only played half the song. So she still tried to lie about it slightly.

Edit: never contacted by Kanye to approve the song. They did say kanye called to ask Taylor to release the song on her twitter account."
popheads,ff9n6gy,t1_ff9krna,1579716504.0,"If it shows how excited she was for the song, then her disappointment that no one liked it... that would be sad and a real moment."
popheads,ff9mz46,t1_ff9k02e,1579716382.0,It premiers tomorrow at sundance. Not on netflix until the 31st.
TaylorSwift,ff9f68q,t1_ff9eqwe,1579711703.0,For vocals.
popheads,ff9dj00,t1_ff7ys3k,1579710644.0,"And you know, she can actually sing live."
popheads,ff7eo59,t1_ff7e7hp,1579647803.0,"Yeah I probably shouldn't have directed my comment at your response, but to the overall post. Thanks for the explanation."
popheads,ff7dgtt,t1_ff7d5lr,1579647014.0,"But will it? We've always known the Grammys were a popularity contest and that artists campaigned for these hard. Now whatever er artist is being discussed here, that was apparently on the voting committee for that category, that's shady AF. But the rest doesnt seem too surprising?"
TaylorSwift,ff7d3sq,t1_ff6yv4k,1579646771.0,No that was its nice to have a friend.
TaylorSwift,ff67ndl,t3_erv2le,1579621067.0,"Ok so this is all going to be political... hm. Taylor says she understands why the director put the kanye stuff in... but I'm worried about that. Just continuing to dredge it all up. But this glimpse into seeing Taylor discuss with her team about the political statement will be really interesting.


Did it rub anyone else the wrong way with the comment from the director on still having male production assistants to show men can fetch coffee for women...? 


And NEW SONG! And showing her write the song. So exciting!"
TaylorSwift,ff67fh7,t1_ff64dj9,1579620921.0,"Well it shows she cares, but not like omg they are wrong how could they, like fans act. But that it sets her to the next focus and to do better because she wants that Grammy."
TaylorSwift,ff59na1,t1_ff4wuo7,1579584429.0,Thanks!  So basically just leave super fucking early for the concert... lol
popheads,ff4wlpw,t3_erlbys,1579574193.0,I describe Harry Styles new album as that album you'd listen to when your laying on the carpet and you're fucked up just enough for everything to be spinning but not so fucked up that you're sick from it.
TaylorSwift,ff4wcrm,t1_ff4juns,1579574022.0,What about the venice beach area?
AmItheAsshole,ff47ws2,t3_erdfim,1579557477.0,Info - did you actually book your wedding and send out invites? Or just verbally confirm the date.
LeopardsAteMyFace,ff3864v,t1_ff2chpa,1579535971.0,"Seriously, and I've seen so many articles about how Mehgan and Kate secretly hate each other and how Mehgan wants to be queen. It's like dude, no she doesnt. She never went in to this marriage hoping William and all of his children would somehow die so she could be queen."
TaylorSwift,ff366sa,t3_ereabq,1579534633.0,We need a neither option. I dont think anything is happening this weekend but I do think she might drop something the following friday with the documentary.
popheads,ff32tyg,t1_ff31pft,1579532224.0,Well fans did pick our her vocal 'oooohs' in this is what you came for and were convinced it was her long before she ever confirmed it.
halsey,ff1uvqz,t3_er3doz,1579486712.0,I personally dont really like either. But the Halsey one at least goes with the color scheme of many covers I have up on my vinyl wall. So I'm happy I got that signed vinyl.
popheads,ff1p9sp,t1_ff1khmr,1579483141.0,"The Gorgeous lyrics cut like glass was the final line for me.

Edit: but I could totally see crying to daylight when Taylor Fucking Swift is explaining her thoughts and feelings personally to you about the song."
TaylorSwift,ff1o0l9,t1_ff1ko1w,1579482375.0,Yeah im thinking it will just be like 3 openers instead of 2. Or just bigger artists opener because its not like they are tour openers.
aww,feyuyex,t1_feyr0xh,1579450848.0,"Actually I might be mis remembering. They made us do the ear tattoo before spaying. Not the vaccines. But I've never heard or been told the vaccines could cause issues so I guess I never questioned it. All of my cats came from the pound though. So even though they are indoor, they still got it."
aww,feyrb2c,t1_feyqyms,1579449686.0,Omg that is rough! We sadly lost one kitten but the other 5 were all healthy. The mama cat was the sweetest stray I've ever met. But I have 3 girl cats. And they hated her. The peeing from my cats started when the mama went back in to heat.
aww,feypnei,t1_feypdff,1579448837.0,"Yeah I think the bigger issue was the mama cat, and less so the kittens. But it wasnt good lol. Took care of my kitten fever though."
aww,feyphix,t1_fexxypj,1579448726.0,You are forced to get it when you spay or neuter though. So all of my cats have it.
aww,feyp9ht,t1_fext965,1579448562.0,"How lucky. Mine took to peeing on everything. 6 months later (all the kittens are gone) it still isnt fully back to normal. Never again.

My dog on the other hand sat outside the door the whole time just crying wanting to see them. They did not ever warm up to him, poor dog."
TaylorSwift,fes7rwg,t1_ferdj19,1579362257.0,I hear soon you'll get better a lot on the country stations in houston.
popheads,femx0p6,t1_femnxme,1579271820.0,The tracklist has been out for a long time...
popheads,fem45t6,t3_epskha,1579239147.0,"I need more time with it. But she released way too many songs before the release. I feel like I've heard the whole album.... need to listen to it more tomorrow. Im sure im going to love it. But I should have held back on listening to some.

Edit: 929 is the best thing I've ever heard."
that_Poppy,fel21qs,t1_fejl0rq,1579212360.0,"I think it's because the ratings are from multiple people at pitchfork, but they get one person specifically to do the review. So this person really liked it, but the overall rating was less."
TaylorSwift,feki98p,t1_feki1pg,1579200599.0,"Ugh, thanks. I needed to read this. Because you're right."
popheads,feizyuw,t1_feips77,1579152070.0,Have you watched the reputation tour movie on Netflix?
AmItheAsshole,fehy3nt,t1_fehv99z,1579126186.0,I work in a large corporate office and it's always the last person who empties it makes a new pot. Maybe very small companies expect the admin to do it..?
AmItheAsshole,fehxwxs,t1_feh9mre,1579126075.0,"Also in a corporate office, the admin is in no way supposed to make the coffee... it's the last person who emptied it makes a new one."
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fehqbeb,t1_fehnoam,1579121751.0,Ah interesting. Middle school/intermediate school is 6-8 then 9-12 is high school for us.
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fehfezu,t1_feg5wtw,1579115419.0,Isn't junior high the same as middle school?  Just different districts call it different things. Grades 6-8. Or is junior high just 9th grade?
AdviceAnimals,fegpwhg,t1_fegn5yr,1579099734.0,I thought that was episode 5? But yes that is the first time I noticed the timelines.

popheads,fead96u,t1_fe8zlbd,1578947200.0,I did this same frame for my signed lover and red booklets. It looks great!
TaylorSwift,fe9z9g5,t3_eo76hg,1578942760.0,"I had it on replay since it came out up until recently. I do feel like I listened to rep non stop for a longer period, than I have with Lover. But I've still listened like 4 months straight."
AmItheAsshole,fe9t1dj,t1_fe917jj,1578941235.0,"I would definitely get pissed off if someone consistently parked in front of my house. But if it's just every now and then or when they have friends over, I would of course not care."
movies,fe97ves,t1_fe8kp0z,1578935138.0,Unexpected Taylor Swift.
TaylorSwift,fe5fadf,t3_enqo64,1578868792.0,I honestly believe so it goes and dancing with our hands tied were either inspired by or at first were about Calvin.
TaylorSwift,fe5eu4u,t3_ensjjn,1578868578.0,The other side of the doors bridge/outro.
popheads,fe3rrou,t1_fe25tn1,1578852216.0,Shes going to wait until lover fest promo/hype to perform it.
popheads,fe3qveb,t1_fe1p6di,1578852005.0,Shes going to wait until lover fest promo time to do cruel summer.
popheads,fdyd661,t1_fdxoumr,1578778486.0,"But I find what Taylor does and what Justin is doing to be very different. With Taylor, shes selling an actual product at the end of it. For reputation, you were encouraged to buy multiple copies, yes so it could go number one, ut you were getting something out of it - which is a better spot in line and cheaper tickets to tour. She wasnt just telling us, here go listen, get me to number one. It was here is this elaborate thing for you to do, which will help me and you."
popheads,fdy8f1k,t1_fdxx6hz,1578777145.0,"I wonder if this would keep Taylor from working with Jack in the future...

Also, what rights do you have with a portion of publishing rights? If Taylor swift can block any use of her music, when she doesnt own the masters, couldn't she also block someone with just a portion if just publishing rights from doing sonethingbwith her music?"
popheads,fdy88at,t1_fdxn4e5,1578777076.0,"I bet it's similar to what she has with her previous albums. Shes the songwriter on all the albums so even though big machine owns the masters, taylor still has to agree to any use of them. This guy may own Jack's piece of it, but Taylor still owns her half, therefore would need her approval. Hopfully..."
TaylorSwift,fdy27as,t3_en9ssn,1578775261.0,Oh my god. We could potentially get a twenty one pilots and Taylor Swift photo.... my two favorites in one place.
popheads,fdrpp44,t1_fdre5dt,1578687833.0,I dont think that's desperate though. It's a tactic to sell more yeah of course. But you are getting a physical product for it.
popheads,fdrfeh7,t1_fdqysgc,1578683715.0,"I dono, if ariana did beauty shots like this I wouldn't have an issue with it."
popheads,fdpo6so,t1_fdpmt94,1578634378.0,Haha yas.
TaylorSwift,fdoqx3h,t1_fdomryb,1578610891.0,"I would say, if there is a show to do it for, it would be lover. Because of the festival feel and the center stage. But I'm not a big pit person. I like having a seat."
popheads,fdo24ir,t1_fdnzckl,1578597492.0,"Taylor swift, Ed Sheeran, Halsey.

Edit: Hmm Halsey actually only has 1 fully self written song...  but I do believe halsey is the driving creative force behind her lyrics and songs."
TaylorSwift,fdnzk4n,t1_fdm2s08,1578596044.0,I think it's something you should try once. But I have to say rep was magical from the nose bleeds because she made that show for people that were far away. I saw it both really close up and in the nosebleeds and I'm really glad I got both experiences. I wasnt in pit though.
TaylorSwift,fdnzbtg,t1_fdngwuh,1578595907.0,"They were very reasonable in presale. I'm 4th row on the floor and they were $375 for lover fest west. Once it goes to general sale they do dynamic pricing, so it's all supply and demand. That's why presale is so important."
TaylorSwift,fdl9x3a,t3_elzaol,1578519555.0,This is the funniest thing I have ever read. I am so sorry for you as that's my favorite song and would hate for it to be ruined. But this is hilarious.
popheads,fdl19n5,t1_fdk6nv9,1578515295.0,Ugh I just hate cynthia woods. Wish it was at toyota.
popheads,fdl16fm,t1_fdkh5os,1578515248.0,"I know, so sad. Its possible for the 26th... but unlikely."
TaylorSwift,fdkzk66,t3_elxvby,1578514385.0,"Sad, I was hoping she would be there. I guess it's possible for the 26th, but unlikely. Heres to hoping for Posty!"
TaylorSwift,fdkjmhe,t3_elssos,1578505061.0,"I won tickets to the super saturday night at&t concert before the super bowl. Best experience ever. Everything was free, all drinks and food. Probably the smallest setting I'll ever get to see Taylor perform in. It was about 10k people. I never win anything so it was pretty awesome to get to go to this."
TaylorSwift,fd5ljea,t3_ek2w8f,1578178768.0,Could be. I also feel like false God could be in the same boat. It's similar to so it goes in tone and feeling as well.
TaylorSwift,fd3ngrg,t3_ejvv3y,1578159986.0,"Whether they are friends or not, it was good Karlie said yes. Because if she said no, it would just be another huge talking point. But I dont think this really proves anything."
TaylorSwift,fd3mbre,t3_ejyg0k,1578159731.0,"I'm starting to think this is more of just a concert than festival. The start time on the ticket is 7pm which is when her normal tour starts. So I'm thinking 2 or 3 openers tops then a full Taylor show. So if its Taylor you want to see, I totally think it's worth it if you have the money."
FigureSkating,fcwemme,t3_ej54bz,1578023672.0,"Cocaine is out of your system in 3 days.... did she really do cocaine right before a competition, or are they randomly drug tested for this stuff?"
TaylorSwift,fctfxsh,t1_fct89ur,1577942000.0,Yeah definitely looks like friends with the purple walls. So on brand.
popheads,fctfn7e,t1_fct2uzc,1577941735.0,"Yeah I agree, not a breakup song. More I'm crazy and I'm glad you still love me for it, and sorry im so crazy. Now meet me in the afterglow and let's get it on."
TaylorSwift,fcp2e6w,t3_eid184,1577848370.0,"I am at a friend's house, just a chill new years. I'm wearing my green Taylor swift rep crop top, with the black snake ring. I dont know how to add a photo...

My favorite movies are probably: The edge of seventeen, Manchester by the sea, Mother, Still alice 

Favorite songs is just too hard.... I'll just do my fav tay songs from this decade: King of my heart, Death by a thousand cuts, All too well, The last time, Long live

TV shows: Game of thrones obviously. Even thought it ended... the way it did. Grace and frankie, Black mirror

Year defining moments... oh gosh I guess a lot happened this decade. I graduated college, bought my first house, doing good at my job. No complaints on the life front.

Happy new years yall."
TaylorSwift,fcowb41,t3_eic1qx,1577843338.0,I thought it was Joe Jonas.
TaylorSwift,fckshjq,t1_fcjf7hy,1577732224.0,Dude same. And it's noon...
popheads,fcks9c8,t1_fckoljo,1577732084.0,A little hyperbolic. But she has lyme disease and has been very sick. She said she wrote this album while fighting to live basically and holed up on the couch the whole time.
popheads,fcj1m08,t1_fcgvqnd,1577675011.0,"Man I was listening to it today. Its not that it's bad, it's just so uninspired. And considering shes on her like death bed, it should have been inspired."

TaylorSwift,fcaj1st,t1_fc9e9kd,1577570111.0,"Not a song feature, just in the mv. But I think a song feature might be needed if she wants a post album single to chart."
TaylorSwift,fcaiz1p,t1_fc9gvst,1577570069.0,"My thought is that it would have Leo doing all the things Taylor has done in her life and have there scathing headlines about leo the same way there were about Taylor. And then show Taylor doing what leo does, being on the beach with all these models and all these praising articles about him. Just a spin on the narrative."

TaylorSwift,fc68oks,t3_eftxe3,1577474830.0,I think you need to calm down. Lover era wasnt affected by cats. Taylor just wants to focus on Lover the song until the end of the Grammys to focus on soty. If anything it's because shes not doing a traditional tour that cut off lover. Shes talking a subdued era to focus on other things in life while still giving us 18 songs to tide us over.
popheads,fc3kh4n,t1_fc3fzau,1577391803.0,I really think it's only stan Twitter and pop heads that care about the camillia comments. The GP doesnt even know nor would they care much.
