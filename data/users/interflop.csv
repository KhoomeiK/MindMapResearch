lostgeneration,ffg6vv2,t1_ff9qash,1579899740.0,And for the most part we're so exhausted working we can't do anything meaningful with our free time besides chores and sleeping.
lostgeneration,ffg4u13,t1_fffutfv,1579898483.0,People would rather worry about guns and abortion than the poors.
PiratedGames,ff4y1yp,t3_eqv655,1579575197.0,I wouldn’t trust any free VPNs. If you’re not paying for the product you are the product.
lostgeneration,fekaso2,t1_fekaejr,1579196168.0,Don’t get me wrong I learned a few things but not enough to justify 4+ years of schooling. The useful information could have been condensed into about 3 months of work.
lostgeneration,fejuqmr,t1_fejg735,1579186301.0,"I'm with you on this for the most part. I learned a few things but for the most part I had no interest spending money in classes I hated that had nothing to do with my major. I was literally there so I could get job training because I wanted a decent job out of school, I didn't care about ""enrichment"" because I was fed up with the school system at that point."
lostgeneration,feh2v8r,t1_feh2qyl,1579108002.0,"I did end up getting a job in my field of study so I guess I lucked out there. Unfortunately it's nowhere near a living wage in NY. I currently make close to 30/hr and work a second job and I still can only kind of get by, not what I was expecting after having ""done everything right"" by going to college and getting a degree in IT."
fatlogic,feh23wr,t3_eotyif,1579107545.0,"If I'm paying money for a personal trainer I want to train with someone who looks like my fitness goal. If I got paired with an overweight trainer I'd demand a new trainer or my money back because how can I take a trainer seriously if they don't even follow their own advice/training? In my opinion when it comes to working in the fitness industry, your level of fitness is part of your resume/brand that I would judge if I'm looking for a personal trainer."
lostgeneration,feh1rme,t1_fegwd9y,1579107343.0,This confuses me tbh. I know things are bad but are they that bad? Even fresh out of school I made 20/hr.
unpopularopinion,fdqhoom,t1_fdo6ael,1578666930.0,"Overweight and obese people are absolutely affecting other people. As others have said here, medical care workers are experiencing increased rates of injuries just trying to manhandle people who are 300+ lbs to the point where we essentially need human hoists to move around people who are so fat and weak they're immobile. It's a huge strain on the medical care system in terms of cost as well since now they have to be able to accommodate  this new demographic. Family members become full time caretakers when someone eats themselves to immobility. This is all without mentioning the excessive consumption of resources to maintain the weight."
unpopularopinion,fdqgyzz,t1_fdpdsbk,1578666421.0,You don't need to eat an entire pizza in one sitting.
unpopularopinion,fdqgwen,t1_fdp8j44,1578666370.0,You would think that the reality that you don't fit in an airplane seat would be a big enough wake-up call that you have to get your act together and drop some weight but apparently not.
fatlogic,fdek4pt,t1_fdek2se,1578340730.0,Yea I was a bit frivolous during the holidays so I'll be starting another cut cycle for the new year.
fatlogic,fdejsf6,t1_fdejooe,1578340523.0,A bonus of being more active is that you get to increase you food intake guilt free too! (In controlled quantities of course)
fatlogic,fddyw3b,t1_fddvyl1,1578327320.0,"Yea for the most part I believe your daily eating habits will get you to a certain weight and stay there if you don't significantly change your nutrition and lifestyle. This is why we keep hearing about how ""100% of diets fail because you just gain all the weight back"" which is true if you treat the diet as a temporary change. If you go on a diet and lose the weight and then go back to eating like you did when you were heavy with no other changes in lifestyle, you shouldn't be surprised that you gain the weight again. This is why when I talk to someone about weight/fat loss, I try to not use the term ""diet"" and instead refer to it as ""changes to nutrition""."
fatlogic,fddyu4t,t1_fddys66,1578327283.0,It's true I'm clueless so ogle away.
fightporn,fddobg5,t1_fdd5wsi,1578319424.0,It's so old I used to see it on compilation shows on TV.
fatlogic,fddn8nt,t1_fddm1q3,1578318467.0,As a guy I thought I never got ogled until my girlfriend pointed it out to me.
fatlogic,fddn4td,t1_fdd49fi,1578318370.0,"For real, half the reason I even go to a gym is to become fit enough that someone ogles me."
trashy,fcystum,t1_fcydc07,1578086327.0,"That's what people seem to forget when you say ""you can just get a bottle of X for $XX"" which is true but you pay for the experience essentially not just the alcohol alone."
fatlogic,fcxi6y6,t1_fcxgy2i,1578063552.0,"The problem is that it’s a lifestyle change, not a temporary fix. They think they can go back to eating how they used to which isn’t the case because that’s how the gained the weight to begin with."
fatlogic,fcxi42y,t1_fcxen3h,1578063494.0,Or they lose the weight and then go back to eating how they did before and are surprised the weight comes back.
unpopularopinion,fc61aye,t1_fc5idxl,1577470020.0,"Genetics don’t make you fat, genetics just decide where the fat is going to end up. You gain fat by eating too much and having no self control while hiding behind excuses."
fightporn,fbvvlqo,t1_fbvrikj,1577136715.0,"Yea if it was just the ""too slow"" gesture it would've been fine. Spitting on a kid is going too far. Totally justified."
