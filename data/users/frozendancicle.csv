Bernie won't come for our guns.  He may, MAY, back a ban on AKs etc., but pistols will be ok.  I say that as someone who enjoys guns and owns a few.

My issue with your statement is that it means you would follow the right off a cliff so long as they are against abortion.  It is up to us to keep our parties in check.  For me, the DNC had become the party of saying the right thing while still being openly beholden to wall street etc.  I'm not against stocks and having corporations, but when a leader purports to be on my side, yet values the thoughts of high level individuals who value ONLY quarterly earnings, then I call bullshit.  When I voted green party in 16 I was hoping to send a message.  Even though I saw the DNC as the lesser of 2 evils, it was not good enough, a course correction was greatly needed.

If you can look at the Republican party and see nothing of significance to be wrong, then you should vote Republican.  However, if you see some disturbing trends, then I would encourage you to make a point to the party that this is the wrong track and you won't just vote blindly.  

Voting for my team, or maybe green party etc., will not lead to some abortiastravaganza.  You still hold the senate and with the SC seats you picked up, your concerns are misplaced I would argue.  In my opinion, as long as decent folk are willing to vote R so long as abortion is the main issue, the worst of your party essentially can subvert your best wishes to enrich themselves.  

Please give some thought to telling the R party to cut the shit.  Abortion is a battle that will remain for the next 50 years, taking 4 or 8 to win back the soul of your party seems worth it.  

No matter what happens, I appreciate that you bothered to voice your opinion and wasn't just insults.  Be well."

I think for Azarim (he's the Israeli right), this was a dude who led Syrians to their border and caused a bit of chaos.  Mix that with Azarims not believing in God anymore, and he sees this 'Messiah' as not only a fraud, but a dangerous trouble maker whose agenda can't be seen clearly.  It would be like knowing someone is a liar, and you scream at them to stop F'ing lying, but they keep insisting they are telling the truth.  If you 'knew' they were lying, every time they denied it, it would make you angrier and angrier.  To top it off, PG knows about his past, what he did.  Not only is this guy an infuriating liar, but he knows his darkest secret and Azarim can't figure out how.


I think Eva is much the same being a non believer, but for her it's less personal.  Her CIA beat is the mideast, so keeping things on an even keel, eliminating threats etc.  She initially sees him as an unknown element that is growing in power over people and events.  But then he pops up in the US, now all of a sudden the chaos he had brought to Syria/Israel etc was on her doorstep, the potential threat went from making her job harder in the mideast, to potentially, destabilizing the power structure in the US.  This danger being emphasized by fast he gathered a large domestic following that was essentially willing to march on Washington.  What happens if this 'fraud' convinced his followers to engage in violence.

My take on that anyways.

Their missile launch proved one thing, we apparently can't stop their ballistic missiles if fired on targets in the region.  In a war, they will launch all that shit immediately and you are going to have quite the death toll.  I believe you are being very unrealistic about how that all would go.

Look at the Taliban.  Compared to a state sponsored military they are a ragtag group with AKs and some technicals, but we cannot get our boot on their neck.  Why?  Iran will run much the same playbook; hiding in mountains and launching raids, chipping away at our soldiers and making sure we could never claim real victory.

After we leave Afghanistan it will be a rather short window before the Taliban grab power again.

Edit:  downvote all you want.  Your delusions of some easy ass victory are just that, delusions.  Are we just knocking out military installations or do we institute a new gov?

I literally watched season 1 in one sitting.  I just finished the last episode and the only reason I am conflicted with this show, is because now I HAVE TO WAIT SOOOO LONG FOR SEASON 2.  Thank you for this great show..you bastards :)"
netflix,fcumqfn,t1_fcuetjj,1577984328.0,"They didn't portray Islam as violent, they portrayed one specific Muslim as being violent and willing to twist Islam to brainwash a teenager.  Have you forgotten Daesh?  

As a westerner, I did not see this as painting Muslims as violent.  All religions have followers who have a propensity for violence.  My advice is to take this show as a work of fiction, a 'what if?' scenario, not commentary on reality.  This life is going to eat you alive if you insist on being so sensitive my friend.  Be well."
