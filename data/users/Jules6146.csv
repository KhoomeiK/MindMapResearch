The diet helps so many people lose weight and really control type 2 diabetes, which is great! It can even help those with seizures reduce them. 

However, for some people their body does not react well to it long term and hyper respond with extremely high cholesterol. Other people have a spike in cholesterol but then their body adjusts to the diet and does very well. 

I would suggest that people who want to try the diet long term do so with doctors supervision (with a doctor familiar with the diet, as not all are) to have blood tests and ensure they are getting proper nutrition."

Marriage,fdzc0np,t3_ena6wp,1578788625.0,"My advice would be to try this and see if it works:

Agree to one hour per night, screen-free activities together - board games, take an exercise class together, puzzles, volunteer at a charity, play cards, build crafts, paint - whatever. 

For example, my husband and I have stressful careers and the past couple years we l’ve been taking hot yoga classes together. It’s done amazing things for our physical health (so much energy) as well as our mental health (sweat the stress out!) and we are closer than ever from it, as well as making lots of new friends at the classes. 

If you can find an activity you like together, it can really help separate work from home and let the stress go at the end of the day. 

Best of luck!"

However, given what you’ve stated about the poor girl, I’d suggest contacting the state child abuse line or the city social worker with your concerns that this girl is begging for medical help or hospitalization and being denied.

As for the barbershop, check with the city to see if it’s properly zoned for a commercial shop use. Keep in mind that if the owner lives in the home where the shop is, that may be a loophole in some areas to allow a small shop in a residential area. All up to the city.

For fence height / fencing restrictions also check with your city. Most have rules about how high your fence can be as they want to avoid homes looking like a prison compound.

Your city’s general helpline should be able to direct you to the correct person to discuss all of these issues.
