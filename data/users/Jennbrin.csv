I'd choose So Cal for the ability to branch out from there. There's a ton of amazing hiking and really amazing things to see in that region. Plus, you can hit up Vegas in the middle of the week for pretty cheap. There are also some pretty cheap, kind of commercialized camp grounds where you can tent, cabin, or car camp called KOA. You can usually camp for free or cheap in national parks too. 

Florida....especially so far south...you're pretty much stuck in Florida. Maybe a bit of the southern portion of the adjacent states...but it's not going to be as diverse as the other two options you've listed. If you make it to the other side of Florida...the Gulf has some of the best beaches I've been to outside of places like Hawaii or Thailand. 

NY won't be bad. There are some pretty awesome things to see and experience in that area. You can drive up to Maine and see the first sunrise in the country - neat experience. Lots of hiking.

I know I can do much more and make much more than I am right now, but I like the flexibility and the work-life balance I'm close to achieving currently. I also believe that I am appreciated at the firm I work for, and that my boss is not trying to be rich at the expense of his employees.

AskParents,ff3oafz,t1_ff3nfk2,1579545321.0,About scaring her - I was thinking more specifically about the stories I've read on Reddit about how someone shared incriminating photos or videos that had their face in it...and then are blackmailed later in life to either keep doing it or to send money or something like that. Those are real stories and real concerns. I don't think she's sharing bad things with people - but I don't think she's too far off (couple of years?) from it simply due to her age and the way kids are these days. I'm sure it feels harmless when you're young..but there are real implications to doing things like that.
AskParents,ff3fjyn,t1_ff3c9s5,1579540031.0,I'm toying with that idea. My hesitation is that she might create another/others and I (or her aunt or mother) will not know about them.
AskParents,ff37nso,t1_ff36qsv,1579535637.0,"Thanks for the feedback about the level of seriousness on the scare tactics.

I have spoken with her aunt. She admits that it scares the hell out of her. She said that she has a program from the wireless provider to be able to see everything on the phone remotely - but she's yet to set it up because she doesn't know how. IMO, she's probably overestimating how much can be viewed, but I can't say for sure.

I think the aunt's comfort is that the child thinks everything is being monitored. I'm just worried that this kid is going to find someone who makes her feel secure and stable in a way her family never has...and then she'll start doing really stupid things. That's my biggest worry."

I'm 33, so I understand the current platforms...but that is a very good point to keep in mind if/when she moves to other platforms in the future. I thought about finding scary stories on the internet about how young kids are blackmailed into bad situations due to sharing inappropriate information. Would that be better than just explaining it to her? Hoping that letting her read it/watch a video for herself instead of just being yet another person telling her not to do something.

I also considered possibly reporting her accounts since she is under the age limit for each one. But I worry she might just make secret accounts or I might not have access to any she makes in the future. What do you think about that?"
Shoestring,fezfwz7,t3_eqs47n,1579456896.0,"All these people telling you to cut cities out - don't listen to them. Do what you want to do. They are correct that you wont see every single thing in every city, but reaearch and prioritize. You can ALWAYS go back. So many people forget that. They think you have to experience everything in a single trip. I think of it like a box of chocolates that you taste each one and then decide which ones you want to eat all of. 

Eurail is definitely more expensive and not worth it for 10 days. Italia is comfortable and have many options for times. Some are cheaper than others. 

Download Google maps offline of the area and just roam around. It'll have all the detail like shops and restaurants...but is usable with cell data turned off. 

Eat some artichokes. Even if you don't like them normally...totally different level over there. So damn good. 

Also - I believe June is high season. We went in May a couple years back. Still hot as balls and pretty large crowds. 

I'm guessing those tickets are for both people total? If not - hold out and sign up for Scott's Cheap flights. There are consistently tickets in the 300-450 range about once a month. And Rome is almost always cheaper to fly into and out of since it is a major international airport.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fencb5k,t1_fen9b9s,1579281627.0,"I'll have to look into that. I read a book on the New Deal back when I was in undergrad, but the details didn't quite stick enough to be able to give appropriate consideration to state of the US immediately following it.

I suppose I've not heard people call Europeans communists (except for maybe Slavic countries that actually were communists when they were younger) in any real way except for much older people. (I'm 33) I do agree that we could use many of the ideologies that Europeans have and that we focus much energy on some issues with negative implications - like work culture and public transit. But the path to making that happen isn't clear cut. Extreme changes are met with equally extreme push back. Slowly chiseling away at the outdated practices, thought processes, and cultural norms will win more ground in the long run and will have a more positive impact.

Also - we're still a pretty young nation compared to much of the western world. I wonder if there are parallels between where we are now and points in European history. I bet that'd be an interesting read."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fenalr3,t1_fen90yh,1579280572.0,"Ohhh. That's what you're getting at. It was unclear. 

I don't think being rich hurts people at all. I have nothing at all against the people who have a fuckton of assets/money/wealth. Many of them worked really hard to get to where they are. I wouldn't want to take that away. That's just poor incentive right there (and incentives really matter in economics).

I just want to know when enough is enough. When does a company have enough money that they can look out on their workers struggling with some basic day to day things...knowing that a marginal amount of money (for the company) could make vast improvements in the standard of living for their employees. Why wouldn't a person want to do that at a certain point? 

I get that they reinvest in order to grow... but the same question can be asked there as well. At what size is it big enough? When do you reinvest in your employees' lives?

WhitePeopleTwitter,fen8dea,t1_fen0pa2,1579279205.0,"Nah - it's more of I started out as a young, rambunctious liberal, then became more educated on fiscal issues and studied cause and effect of past policies. I like to keep learning and (hopefully) improve myself and my stances based on the additional information I did not have prior.

I don't believe that ""the correct policy is always in the middle"" at all. I believe that SOME things are...just as SOME things are better on the left and SOME things are better on the right. I don't want to have to conform to shit Trump supporters want OR what fucking Nancy Pelosi wants. I don't want to ONLY agree with a single news source. That's not that way it should work. I want to make informed decisions and not let a single group tell me what I'm suppose to think.

We're manipulated enough as it is through marketing and media... I refuse to be manipulated this way without a little bit of a fight.

Edit\* Also - Can you tell me more about the shift to a more conservative overton window? Honestly, I feel that it's been more and more left moving. Think of civil rights over the last few year.

However, while doing that - I actually stumbled upon the answer from [winstonchurchill.org](https://winstonchurchill.org). The spreading of that quote was made popular by the book [Churchill's Secret War: The British Empire and the Ravaging of India During World War II, by Madhursree Mukerjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill%27s_Secret_War). She gets the information from [Leo Amery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Amery)'s diary. 

> Amery privately decided that “on the subject of India, Winston is not quite sane,” and recorded in August 1944 Churchill’s remark that relief would do no good because Indians “breed like rabbits” and will outstrip any available food supply. “Naturally I lost patience,” Amery records, “and couldn’t help telling him that I didn’t see much difference between his outlook and Hitler’s, which annoyed him no little.”

VegRecipes,fdr3nc4,t1_fdqzdnb,1578679063.0,"In general with recipes like these...they use rice or beans as the carbs. Maybe roasted potatoes. These wedges could be roasted, I suppose. But if they're fried...it's an indulgence. It's just refreshing to see something I'd eat 100%...not 80% of.

I'm not anti-carb. I agree that a balanced meal is more important than whatever fad diet is going around at the time."
Frugal,fdr1b64,t3_emqxnj,1578678150.0,"Real question here - Are they giving you a W2 at the end of the year? Or a 1099? Easiest way to tell is if you get a paycheck that has FICA and other taxes withheld.

That will make a difference.  

A W2 means you're an employee...in which case, as others have pointed out, what they are doing is not legal. They should raise your wage. 

A 1099 means you're not their employee. It also means they're probably misclassifying you as well on their taxes in order to avoid paying certain items (but let's not get ahead of ourselves...)."

AskEurope,fcz6dac,t1_fcx3cw0,1578094583.0,"I'm also a cynic - especially with politics and world events. 

However, I don't think Trump needs to do anything like that to win. Not even really a supporter of his - It's just statistically more likely that an incumbent wins. Plus - the Dems have soooo many candidates that their base is pretty split. 

> Would serbia react with an assassination? 

I mean - I find it more likely that someone high up wants him assassinated so they maneuvered a situation in a particular way for this to happen...triggering those events. Especially if they want public support for something like military spending."

Interesting. 

Care to elaborate on what makes it disproportionate? You thinking too large or too small?

I have this idea/desire to travel the US like I travel countries outside the US. The idea of not having a car and needing to be a little more resourceful sounds kind of neat.

1.  It's not just your cologne/perfume. It's also your fabric softener. Pleeeeease cut down on that on your gym clothes. It's really hard to breathe during heavy cardio when someone is beside you smelling like a bottle of gain. It smells good - but it literally makes the air catch in my airways. 

3. Body Glide - you can get it in the sports section at Target - best thing on the market for chub rub"
