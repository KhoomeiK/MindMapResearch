Bernie was on defense before he even announced his run, and as the front runner/household name Biden is naturally gonna get external attention. If someone even covers Bloomberg though, its something like NBC giving nothing but praise to Bloomberg as ""The billionaire who can match Trump"" with little to no data based analysis. 

He's literally buying the election and intentionally dodging any forum that would bring criticism. At least on the debate stage, you see Biden called out for iffy race stances in the past.

That being said, violence is never a viable form of protest; it doesn't change minds and only allows them to play victim. Revolution is the only time violence could be remotely be considered an effective answer, and last time I checked fascists weren't in control.

Research in of itself doesn't restrict civil rights. It simply tells you what is or is not happening, which can then be used to determine causation and potential responses.

Virginia,ff2ihtf,t1_ff1qd1l,1579507612.0,"If you check out any pretty much any other comment chain on this post, every single one I was involved with acknowledged that the Reps in question are not white supremacists themselves, thus the statement telling them to stay tf away. 

What we *were* acknowledging is that every pro-gun person is very agitated about this event, and that the white supremacists who do exist are overwhelmingly going to be/vote Republican. 
So, even at the risk of upsetting both bases, the racists and the gun group, the Reps did the right thing in saying none of that should be going on. 

Remember that Charlottesville started out as a rally for the Civil War monuments. It obviously would look extremely bad for anything similar to happen again, and this time the event is literally about guns. So they just took the extra precaution and made sure it was obvious what they did and did not think would be beneficial, which is good because lives are potentially at stake. 

This also shows integrity, because they are literally publically shaming and disowning a group that would otherwise come out to vote for them no problem. If any number in the gun groups also view this as a slight against them/the event, because their cause is potentially not as numerous as it was before, then the Reps have potentially lost a sizable(at least for local elections) part of their electorate. 

Other Republicans or groups are staying quiet/even escalating this issue further, despite the very real probability *someone* will get hurt. So I recognize the Reps here as doing the correct thing, even though they could be saying the same talking points for extra electoral brownie points. 

The reason I called your response a strawman was because I at no point claimed these reps/ even everyone going to the protest are white supremacists, or that they had ever supported them. That would obviously be a quite biased stance, and your 3 pargraphs of grandstanding would make sense. But instead, I acknowledged them taking precautions to avoid a dangerous event from the portion who *are* armed upset racists, even if it comes back to bite them in the ass to some degree."

Check out the Dickey amendment. 

No, if Climate organizations bought off Congress and threatened to hold them in contempt for the slightest deviation, I would not support them. If people were dying because those who profit off of windmills had silenced dialogue and research into it, it would be a problem.
But instead, they educate and provide resources for conservation areas and support threatened species, also work to reduce things known to kill living species/the planet. I'm not even gonna make an argument that a climate group, when acting in the way just described, is more moral than a group whose sole existence is to sell killing tools. Both are democracy, both are important to people, and they aren't mutually exclusive. 

Climate groups are spreading fear. But you know what causes more?? Australia and the Amazon literally on fire, in addition to more frequent and more extreme events like this every year. Data backs up climate fear overwhelmingly. Gun rights are a fair discussion to have, but up until recently it was hard as hell to even get data. 

As for your final points, I would suggest looking into money relationships between gun manufacturers and the NRA, and the rates at which guns are bought after a shooting occurrs and NRA talking points increase."

But money in politics is disgusting, and if any one group would make the perfect case study its the NRA. 

More than any other group like that I can think of, the NRA is a confirmation bias cult that makes money of off fear mongering, which then goes to the people who benefit; the companies producing guns. Average people who have given a single dollar to the NRA are victims from a predatory misinformation campaign that was only allowed to flourish due to deteriorating profit-driven media outlets and lack of critical thinking in schools.

The only modern context here is those who will be old enough to legally vote for the president should also be able to vote on who gets to run. You can argue that some teens may already be mature enough to logically vote before they hit 18, which I would agree with. 

But, r/unpopularopinion here, it really doesn't matter if you can be 'smart' with a controlled substance when you're under 18, it still fucks up your body on a completely different scale when compared to an adult who's brain has already finished developing. Even if it didn't, if a certain age group disproportionately acts like dumbasses with controlled substances, because *on average* they literally lack the ability to do any better, then controlling it isn't some fascist boot to the teeth. 

Correct me if I'm missing something here, but I see that exact point every time some teen/young adult right's thing is brought up. Color me a little fed up with it I guess."

college,fdq7gbk,t3_emd94u,1578658082.0,"I worked seasonal last year at a college B&N doing exactly what you mentioned. Now, there were a great many books with rental used options even though they were only ever available to buy new (code books especially). 

To play devil's advocate, the one I worked at was for a 30-40K+ student population. I more or less believe they got every used book they could get their hands on, but keep in mind those are the highest in demand. If going through a store like that buy as early as possible, unless you think the professor won't require the book. I believe there is also an option to only reciece the condition you asked for. 

Also, if I remember correctly return policies are *extremely* leniant, especially through the first week, so you have ample opportunity to return/check again/go somewhere else if all the used ones are gone. It could go both ways as well; we would only have used versions of books people demanded new on; they'd get it for the used price of course, and were free to change it out after the fact. The other option is not fulfilling the order until the exact requested one came in, which may create more problems for the student."
