leaves,fe5e7k5,t3_enu775,1578868263.0,Check out the book atomic habits it talks about this. You can create a new positive association with that space. Changing it is a good idea.
leaves,fe3h3bq,t3_enk0qh,1578849197.0,"The sleep I get is unbelievable. My whole nervous system is getting arrest from years of abuse. It's weird that weed is known to be calming, I find it takes me for a total roller coaster ride of nervousness and paranoia with yes some relaxing and interesting elements but it's predominantly toxic. I did read that weed with the way it's absorbed in the body is different things to different people so it's possible for some people it's relaxing but we all know inside what it is for us. For me it's the opposite.

It's also a shortcut to joy. Short-lived but the joy is there and once you get used to that shortcut pretty much everything else in your life fades away. When you take that shortcut out your brain still wants the joy but you are kind of cornered and you have to work for it, which means letting real living things into your life, real experiences. It's a slow process changing habits but I'm enjoying feeling my heart opening to experiences that aren't just getting buzzed alone. 

I can actually pay attention to shows I'm watching instead of repeatedly going what the f just happened where was I.

I'm proud as hell to have the courage to be present for my life and not cop out getting high.

Binge eating has nearly stopped, which was a huge problem for me.

I wake up with energy, not even drinking caffeine and I'm flying. Even with the a cold this week I worked extra hours.

Making more money at work.

Saving money on junk food and weed.

Meal prepping staying on top of groceries.

Way way way less irritable.

I've never really had girlfriends because I was too paranoid and to be honest weed and porn gave me everything I felt like I needed, joy rides. But now that weed is removed there's an empty space there and I can see the value another functioning human being would bring, I can see the value of real connection where as before it made my skin crawl. I want to work toward having a family now. But I'll only date someone who is sober. I feel this is the best way to live.

My lungs feel better.

I'm really excited for life."

leaves,fe0fibo,t3_enk0qh,1578812541.0,For me it is literally the difference between living and not living. It's night and day. I smoked for 15 years and stopped 2 weeks ago and life is so much better without it Oh my God.
leaves,fdptazd,t3_emi6qw,1578639636.0,ABSOLUTELY 100%
leaves,fdprvpr,t3_emmpio,1578638107.0,"Take it on the chin. It's part of the process and absolutely worth it.

When your brain gets bored enough it will demand you find something worth while to do. Ganja is the easiest cop out joy ride. It's joy without effort.

The brain gets used to it but after starving it of this joy for a while it will literally manipulate you into doing something with yourself. It is right now just resisting change.

Your garden is empty all the flowers are dead. It's a long slow process just sitting in the sun. But new life will come, if you can take it on the chin.

It's just how things work.

Wish you the absolute best.

Oh also NA meetings are extremely fucking helpful. Extremely."
