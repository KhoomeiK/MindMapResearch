MadeMeSmile,ffdn8bm,t3_esz7cl,1579824479.0,"I know people often say not to have children bcs they're satan spawns, but I think it all depends on how you teach them. My mom always disiplined us with rod of love and taught us that we cant get everything just because we want it, her children grew up having lots more common sense and compassions than other children. Both parents and children also look out for each other. While my aunt always listens to her children whims, it wasn't surprising her children grew up to be lil nightmares.

Having kids is not bad, you just have to know how to do it right. Just remember pampering and listening to their whims is a big no no, that's the most essential ingredient to create a lil demon."

selfimprovement,fdmibos,t1_fdm8lze,1578550931.0,"Yeah, and it's actually a part-time job. I think it was because they're short of experienced staff, or he just didn't want all his effort in teaching me went to waste.."

I just called my boss yesterday saying I wanted to quit but he said no because I only have short shifts and it shouldn't be a problem even if I'm busy. 

Busy is one of the reason I want to quit, but also because I don't like my current work environtment with super strict boss and cold coworkers, and my boss always reject me everytime I apply for more shifts, so my salary definitely isn't enough for me to save up for university next year.

I've been hesitating whether I should quit or just hang on until I graduate, but yeah you're right. My boss reaction shouldn't stop me from choosing the best decision for myself and my future. Thank you OP."
