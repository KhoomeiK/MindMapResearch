aww,fc9slv6,t1_fc9qeif,1577557600.0,I mean yeah a chicken is not as intelligent but it still feels pain and experiences stress the same way as any other sentient animal does.
aww,fc9qivw,t1_fc9qbze,1577556680.0,"Yeah that would be really shitty, I just haven't really seen much of a source on that so I'm just skeptical for now."
aww,fc9qcnm,t1_fc9q1dt,1577556602.0,Hell yeah brother!
aww,fc9pybg,t1_fc9ngqj,1577556430.0,"I mean it's not any more inhumane than most pig or chicken factory farms, it's just easier to be outraged because we're not used to it being done to dogs. To be clear though I agree that's disgusting behaviour, just saying it's not unique."
