She lived an hour from me, but I wanted to help her out and convinced her of the need to backup her files occasionally onto CDs (that's how we did it back then).  I spent the afternoon getting it installed and troubleshooting it (I was no computer whiz), and then travelled home.  I heard from my mom a couple of days later that - far from praising me for my effort - she was bitching to everyone about how now her printer didn't work.  Of course a couple of days later, she discovered that the ink cartridge was empty, and started snidely crowing ""God forbid my passive HUSBAND lifts a finger to replace the ink when it's out"".  Not a word about her ungratefully - and incorrectly - smearing me.

HomeLoans,feksjs8,t1_fekqn53,1579206712.0,"Interesting.  So I ran a bunch of calculators, and so far I like this one the best, it seems to compare the remaining amortization schedule for both scenarios.  I might have made wrong assumptions in certain areas, but here's what I got:  [https://www.calculatestuff.com/financial/refinance-calculator?current\_loan\_balance=328000.00&current\_monthly\_payment=2150.00&current\_interest\_rate=4.839&refinanced\_term=15&refinanced\_interest\_rate=3.100&fees=5000.00#results](https://www.calculatestuff.com/financial/refinance-calculator?current_loan_balance=328000.00&current_monthly_payment=2150.00&current_interest_rate=4.839&refinanced_term=15&refinanced_interest_rate=3.100&fees=5000.00#results)

According to this calculator, if I refinanced to a 15yr@3.1%, I'd pay $115 more per month, but I'd save $100k over the life of the loan vs. what I'm paying now.  From peeking into the amortization schedule, even if I sold my house three years from now, I'd still have have socked away $30,000 more in equity.

According to my current mortgage company's website, if I add $115 to my current payment, I'd save $17,000 in interest over the next 20 years.

This does seem like a no-brainer, even if the ultimate refinance terms aren't nearly as rosy as I've used in this calculator.  The extra $115/month isn't an issue, and I like the idea that so much more of that monthly payment is going in the equity 'bank' each month.

Am I missing something here?  As I mentioned originally, my head swims a little when discussions turn to complex math.  And that makes me a prime target for mortgage brokers, who probably sense that I'm easy to screw with."
HomeLoans,fekovoq,t1_feko0t2,1579204547.0,"Thanks!  ~~There must be a way for me to calculate the total amount of interest I'd pay in the next 20 years with my current mortgage vs. a new, shorter mortgage, right?

Edit:  I figured it out. The Internet's pretty cool."
