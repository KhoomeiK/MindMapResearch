He lets us pick him up, pet him but doesnt trust us enough to full on cuddle. Eclectuses are not nearly as cuddly as most birds and they don't like that much cuddling but they do appreciate it from time to time.

parrots,ff75hd7,t3_eryljy,1579641511.0,"Please get rid of sand paper perches because they do make the nails less sharp but scratch up the soft skin on their feet. This can cause infections or bumblefoot. Also remove wooden dowel perches (the same perimiter all the way through) because they can cause sores and bumblefoot if they sit on them too long. Get a branch from a tree you know is non toxic to parrots (for example apple or pear tree wood), boil it to kill any bacteria and put it in the cage. You have to have a brush for the water bottle because bacteria can build up extremely quick in those tubes. If you want any other tips, feel free to ask."

Get things such as rope perches, or soak tree branches (from trees that are non toxic for birds such as pear and apple trees) in boiling water to kill the bacteria and give him that. He might not want to go on his perches so wait for him to step up. We have a ladder and mango was scared of itbut a few days later went on it. Leave one of them in so he can get used to his surroundings, then remove the wooden dowel perches completely. Doesn't mean you have to throw them away, you van use them for training.
