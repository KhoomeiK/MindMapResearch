baltimore,ffg095x,t1_fffwrj0,1579895660.0,Oh I fully agree with you. Got beef with someone? Keep that between you and them. Don't go shooting around willy nilly.  Goodness knows how many people are hurting now over this poor woman's death.

There are consequences of doing bad things and sometimes those consequences out way the wrong that was done in the first place so it's better to avoid such things so you don't have to worry about them.

The world we live in annoys me so much because people are so determined to sugar coat everything under the sun. Instead of trying to get to the root of why people are doing the drugs they want to make it easier or better for them to do it and I totally disagree with that."
baltimore,fffurld,t1_fffdnn4,1579892239.0,Yeah I agree with you for sure
baltimore,fffulvt,t1_fffbsoo,1579892140.0,"Basically. When they were discussing this on the show I was considering if that could possibly be a good idea after all.  Problem is, getting people to go to the ""free zone"" when they can just get high wherever they are.  Not to mention drug dealers being over there and raising the price of the product further making people not want to go there to get high.

I think it's better to get people off the drugs in the first place and stop playing with this issue altogether.    While this is being done knock out nicotine products and help out the alcoholics as well."
baltimore,ffftlxq,t1_fff7qr1,1579891523.0,Yes. I agree with this for sure.
baltimore,fffsndz,t3_etc0hc,1579890929.0,Goodness. I wonder what happened
baltimore,fffsgfq,t1_ffffqw4,1579890809.0,It's already open I was just by there on Wednesday
baltimore,fffsefx,t1_fffr2u9,1579890773.0,No. Marc is $8 each way. Amtrak is $14 and greyhound is $17. I was just on the Marc train on Wednesday from Baltimore to D.C. and back.

baltimore,ffdu73s,t1_ffdcs00,1579829029.0,It is and I don't go often but only if I happen to be in DC and that part of town. DC is where I am from and I still have family there.

gardening,ffcyilj,t3_esy3rj,1579809902.0,That's not a Geranium. It sounded weird when you said the plant wouldn't die and then you mentioned that it rooted from its vines and that really confirmed it for me.  The plant looks really familiar but I do know it's a vine that I have removed from houses and it's very invasive as well.

baltimore,ffa6mk2,t1_ff9709t,1579728900.0,Thanks but I'm well aware of that in fact.  I was just over there on Monday. A larger store should have a better hot foods bar and that will be amazing.

baltimore,ff95qoe,t3_esd6td,1579705481.0,I am so happy to have seen the construction making more and more progress over the past few months. I truly love going to Whole Foods and look forward to the new cafe seating at the new location.
baltimore,ff95bnv,t3_es2tbv,1579705200.0,I just hope that new Whole Foods has a larger seating area like the the ones in D.C. do.  The one at H st has enough seating for about 100 people and it's really nice to go up there and enjoy a nice meal.
baltimore,ff94wdw,t1_ff8xebc,1579704911.0,That is an interesting idea to say the least

baltimore,ff94sh3,t3_esbyzg,1579704837.0,Even if you tax Cannibis you are still have the problem of corrupt people in this city that would find ways to siphon the money into their own pockets. They already do that with the education system as it is. We've also had Mayor's that get involved in shady business deals as well.
baltimore,ff94kg3,t1_ff90sl1,1579704686.0,Thanks.
baltimore,ff947c4,t1_ff8nw3f,1579704438.0,Perhaps. I still think this whole situation is ridiculous.
baltimore,ff8997y,t1_ff81zgu,1579669751.0,"Yeah, that's more than reasonable. In Thiru's case he should have just paid the consequences for his stupid behavior and moved on with his life.

baltimore,ff7zck8,t1_ff6dpw2,1579661984.0,Why would you feel a need to tell the police to turn off their bodycam if you aren't doing anything wrong?

baltimore,ff63zvi,t1_ff4joq1,1579618562.0,I don't like the entitled mentality that he has. The Police should have their bodycam when dealing with him like anyone else. He was the dummy cruising around on Greenmount at 1 am in the first place breaking laws.
baltimore,ff63nka,t1_ff51mah,1579618321.0,What restaurant did he eat that night and what time did he leave there.
baltimore,ff63d0w,t1_ff4upli,1579618111.0,You know when people constantly cry wolf it gets to the point where it waters down the meaning of what it is they are concerned about and that's not good at all.
baltimore,ff62e2k,t3_erq3tm,1579617400.0,"I've been getting around via public transportation just fine in the past few years I have been coming to Baltimore. At the same time I do happen to live along several pretty good bus lines and it's easy for me to get to where I need to get to as well.

People do use the bus system everyday and some people ride from Amazon to Pikesville on a regular basis as well.

So my question to you is where do you intend to live in Baltimore and do you have a job lined up already?

I'm from D.C. and after coming to Baltimore I have a new appreciation for subways since Baltimore only has 14 stations altogether when that would be less than one half of one line in D.C.. Also, I used to live where I could walk to several stations that go different directions as well.  So best believe that Baltimore is an adjustment for me as well.

Now what Baltimore does have that's really nice is the free commuter boat.  You can take that from Canton to Locust Point to Fells and walk over a bit to catch a boat to Federal Hill."
theboondocks,ff5wrz2,t1_f6o5zk2,1579612852.0,Argument wasn't about the chicken sandwich per se. They were already beefing before they happened to be in the same store.
theboondocks,ff5vhrx,t3_ec9gat,1579611661.0,This is awesome!
baltimore,ff4w3v6,t1_ff4i8yi,1579573853.0,"I said that and I shouldn't have. One case I can think of is when the victim is cooperative and they end up dead such as in this case. https://www.wbaltv.com/article/mother-of-eight-fatally-shot-in-front-of-children/10026919.

As law enforcement you no doubt know about the ""no snitching"" rule that goes on in various communities in Baltimore.  The woman did what so many people here clamor for people to do and what happened? Moment's after talking to the police she was dead.  Why in the world would police come to the woman's house in a situation like that?  Granted, she could have ""snitched"" many times before and this was the last straw or something but this is still ridiculous nonetheless.  I bring her up because you used the term ""cooperative victim"". That rubbed me the wrong way because there are situations when you really have to think about your life and that of your families as well.  Especially when you are concerned that whoever did it will be out of jail soon anyway. Why put oneself in that kind of danger?  

To be clear, I am not talking about people that are criminals. In my opinion you get what you get. That's why I was outraged that Freddie Gray became a martyr the way that he did.  I get that police brutality is indeed a thing but for goodness sakes use  a better person to represent your cause.  

My original annoyance comes from constantly hearing about this police officer doing this and this police officer doing that.  Of the judges and other people letting people with a rapsheet longer than a cvs receipt back onto the streets to continue to terrorize their neighborhoods. Like the guy that raped that girl near her school recently. Had he been incarcerated it would have prevented that poor child from sufffering that terrible trauma. In cases like that you already know the person is guilty based on what I read he lived nowhere near the school of the child he harmed and that made it even crazier. Where was law enforcement to protect that child? Who enabled that situation to take place in the first place?

To be clear the people that are guilty of assault and battery towards that officer deserve to be locked up.  That was wrong. How long will they be locked up since they were on camera and known by the officers in the area along with a cooperative victim?"
college,ff4soah,t1_ff4d1wf,1579571502.0,I'm sure we all agree that people should be responsible when it comes to pets.  Even the best of intentions don't always mean the best outcome. A person can have the best of intentions towards they're pet but just didn't think things through.
BeavisAndButthead,ff4f2st,t1_fezeh9c,1579562084.0,Lol you really did think this through for sure.

baltimore,ff4bsim,t1_ff38ba2,1579559920.0,"Could it be that as the result of the light rail going to Hunt Valley that people have moved to the area that are commuting the crimes?  Mind you the light rail goes from there to Glen Burnie and all through the city along the way. Has crime risen at each of those stations?

What makes Hunt Valley so special? I'm honestly asking because I haven't been out there."
washingtondc,ff4bf02,t1_ff37pfs,1579559682.0,I'm actually from D.C. so I think I can b of help. I think I know just what you are looking for.
college,ff4b10y,t1_ff46mw1,1579559436.0,To be fair you walked into what a person said that was how they feel about the matter. If you disagree fine but there is nothing wrong with just agreeing to disagree.
college,ff4at88,t1_ff3qid0,1579559298.0,"You make very good points. Having a pet can be a very wonderful experience but it is certainly not something that is absolutely necessary. 

I agree with you that students who abandon animals are irresponsible.  I can understand an emergency situation where there is no choice but this idea of just leaving animals around isn't cool at all."
college,ff4a40e,t1_ff3nbhv,1579558856.0,Good idea.
college,ff49w5q,t1_ff3rfo5,1579558719.0,Better to not get the animal in the first place. You have to really think these things through as that's what's best for the animals.
