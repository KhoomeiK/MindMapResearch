nevertellmetheodds,feowwl6,t1_feow04k,1579307158.0,"There are 7.5 billion people in the world. Think about how many photos are taken every day, you yourself are probably in hundreds, if not thousands, of photographs with strangers in the background. Now think about how many people get married, the US alone has around 2.5 million weddings each year. Add in to the mix that people in the same photo often live in the same part of the world.

This seems like it would be very unlikely when viewed as a single incident, but when you look at the number of opportunities something like this has to happen it really isn't. There are probably many more married couples who featured in photos together when they were younger who just haven't realised it."
