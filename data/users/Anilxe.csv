bisexual,ff7mcsn,t1_ff7lpa1,1579652990.0,"Yeah, I did stop posting literally anything in r/sex because my inbox would be flooded with guys asking to see my body, describe my experiences in excruciating detail (even when I once posting about getting over part of my sexual trauma, a creep wanted to know exactly how I'd been raped and if it felt good even though I was scared and traumatized). Some were more clever, asking ""Is it alright if I ask you some questions?"" And then they were obviously questions used to get themselves off on their fetish. Some want to know how good my partner is in bed, and then try to convince me that they'd be better. The list goes on.

Honestly, r/bisexual has been the only place where I'd felt comfortable saying ""This turns me on""  without fear of my inbox being pulverized."

Yeah, its definitely rough. That's exactly what my father did to me. He did not want to be a father, he asked my mom to get an abortion, she said no. He tried to work out his issues with therapy, and still abandoned me when I was 7 because he just couldn't do it, just like he knew he didn't want to before I was born. Even though they used protection, the pill and a condom, my mother became pregnant with my brother and my Dad decided he absolutely could not do more than he was already doing. 

I 100% wish he'd just stepped out before I was born, because now I have a traumatic childhood and abandonment issues.

A child deserves to be raised by parents who WANT them, and forcing someone to be a parent against their wills never has a good outcome for the child. Better an absent father than an emotionally abusive and/or neglectful one.

TwoXChromosomes,feg1a90,t1_fefanc8,1579072647.0,"Ive been seeking a hysterectomy for years due to  excessive uterine pain and bleeding. I also have PCOS and Endometriosis. LlI'm also a bit cowardly and shy. Ive had a few doctors continue to convince me to go onto birth control, time and time again. Try this, working? No? Next, this one. Making it worse? Oh no no, can't have that, let's try this one. 

I am 28 and have not wanted nor had any children, and with every passing year, the desire to be childless only grows. But every. Single. Doctor I've spoken to tries to convince me to wait, what about my partner? What if I get married and he wants children? The pain can't be that bad, can it? Surely you're lying, or weak, or faking. This is normal for many women! 

Ive been bleeding since December 18th. Think about that for a moment. It's been over 3 weeks, I have to change my tampon every 3 hours. I have alarms set 2 times while I sleep so I don't bleed into the bed. My vaginal canal is *dry* and *feeling chapped*. I have to splurge and get the pearl tampax because using the cheap cardboard ones feel like they're tearing my insides out. Tampax costs roughly 10-15 bucks a box. 

Sex is uncomfortable, thank goodness I have a loving and understanding partner, unlike many women in my shoes. I'm constantly feeling weak. My limbs, tendons, feel tired. Just take iron supplements and drink water, you'll be fine young lady. It's not as bad as you think.

OldManDog,fefm0xy,t1_fefkt34,1579059214.0,"I'd love to share her story. 

My partner and I picked up Sandy and her son Jake at the Yakima, WA dog shelter. The workers there were so happy because they'd been trying to adopt them together for over a year because they were obviously a bonded pair, but many people only wanted Jake because he was younger. My partner and I had been looking to adopt a bonded pair in the first place, so this was fitting. They'd been found wandering the streets together with Jake protecting Sandy. 

We took them on hikes, to the beach, went camping with them, but most of our time was spent cuddling on the couch. They were both the sweetest dogs we'd ever met, not an ounce of aggression in their bones. Jake protected Sandy in the way that he always tried to cover her scent, cleaned her eyes and ears for her, and always gave her a warm side to lean against. 

Unfortunately, Jake succumbed to kidney disease last March and it wrecked our tiny family. Sandy was lost for many months, as was I because Jake was my sweet boy. Sandy had bonded most closely with my partner, and only became more attached to him after Jake's death. A couple months later I made the plunge to get my first puppy to see if I had what it took to raise a youngin. 

Sandy hated Ember at first, but over the course of a few months, she deigned to allow him to sleep next to her, and as recently as a few weeks ago she started actually playing back, having a little extra spirit in her step. 

But a cough she'd had this whole time started getting worse, and last weekend she suddenly couldn't walk, was shaking, throwing up, and refusing food or water. We took her to the vet and they found 2 new tumors that had showed up in her lungs over the last few months. We had a vet, the vet same vet that came to our place when Jake was sick, come to end her suffering. Our best friend joined us as we gave her a ton of love in her last moments. Ember said goodbye, though he didn't understand what was going on and next went to tear up a paper towel on the couch. 

I watched her last breath leave her body, and I cried. A lot. But I'm also happy to have given her the best ending I could, and I'm relieved that she's no longer tired nor in pain. I love her and will always miss her, just as I still miss her son, Jake.

You know how often the kids of the elderly actually cared to even check in on them, or call them, or even write them a letter? Probably about 5%. The rest were too busy with THEIR lives to even bother. I can't even count how many times I sat next to beds, listening to stories lamenting about how they wished their children would visit them, after they'd done so much for them and raised them. These people were so desperate for human contact, they'd pour their hearts out to a stranger who would give them the time of day. 

I would actually say the childless elderly were much happier, as they had much better social skills developed to make friends wherever they ended up, they were used to the solitary aspect of life, and plenty of money saved spent they could afford the best services available.

Then we started messing around. We didn't have sex, but we got close. And then when he came, he laughed and said ""I get my $20 bucks now!"" 

Turns out, his friends had dared him to date and get me to get him off, for $20. He kept laughing while I stared on in horror, suddenly feeling really disgusting and shameful. I got dressed and left his place as soon as I could. 

To this day, it takes me a very long time to warm up to the idea of having sex with a person I've been interested in.

Fuck you, Vinnie."
OkCupid,fdscbr9,t3_emxdlt,1578699352.0,"If you read The Gift of Fear, a chapter covers this aspect, called Typecasting, pushing someone to prove they're better than you expect them to be makes them often vulnerable to being abused, if they don't catch it.

*""Typecasting always involves a slight insult, and usually one that is easy to refute. But since it is the response itself that the typecaster seeks, the defense is silence, acting as if the words werenâ€™t even spoken.""* - Gavin de Becker

In this case, the ""Typecast"" is that she's  over-sensitive. Many people fall for this, feeling the urge to defend themselves, which is exactly what the guy wants. And this isn't gender specific."
OkCupid,fdsbbld,t1_fdsb520,1578698675.0,"Same. I'm currently dating a guy that's 5'5"", I'm 5'3"". I've dated guys shorter than me to almost uncomfortably taller. It's never the height that's a ""deal breaker"", but who they are as people, how empathetic they are, if they have passions that drive them."
OkCupid,fdsatx6,t1_fds72m2,1578698344.0,"I am one of those people that joke about my fatness, and gently prod people that dance around it. The point though is that that still doesn't make it ok for someone to randomly message you out of the blue with this neg-message."
OkCupid,fdsam6z,t1_fds5bqw,1578698199.0,"Why are you lumping women into one category like this? How is OP showing a double standard? We're not part of a hive mind. OP didn't single this dude out because of his height, she got messaged BY HIM and his first thing to do was insult her. I'd have the same repulsed reaction if this was a message from a girl mocking a dude for his height with no provocation. It's rude, it's unnecessary, and neither of them are ok."
OkCupid,fdsa9my,t1_fds15h8,1578697962.0,"Its totally cool to be single if that's what you want and are happy with. 

But this guy isn't trying to live his best single life. He's seeking a partner, and going about it the wrong way."
AmItheAsshole,fds0sfa,t1_fdqjutp,1578692472.0,"Yeah I'm having a hard time believing this post. My partner has a dairy allergy and even though we're not married and have only been together a few years, I am *adamant* about making sure I never put dairy in anything I make. It's not that hard using soy, coconut, margarine, etc replacements. I couldn't imagine even being upset at him for not eating something I'd made if I accidentally put dairy in it, I would feel profusely apologetic! 

IF this is real, NTA."
KarmaCourt,fdqotxz,t1_fdn81ah,1578671660.0,You're doing a great job of letting them know they're doing a great job!
