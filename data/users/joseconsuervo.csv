Detroit,fffoa5q,t1_fffbssw,1579888232.0,"the idea of AT&T ***ever*** doing any useful customer service blows my mind.

So what, this idiot can't even figure out how to close a door, I don't think you're in any real danger here."
AutoChessMobile,ffd8s5o,t1_ffd8mfy,1579815650.0,I mean I guess it's possible if you do like 10k dmg in one hit and the enemy has 100 hp that you still get credit for 10k. I just didn't think it worked that way. I've never had a unit hitting that hard either lol so who knows.
AutoChessMobile,ffd7zoe,t3_esryqh,1579815195.0,I don't even understand how a team can have that much hp. in round 36 no less
Detroit,ffcrtdr,t1_ffcrkvy,1579805946.0,I assume they all find it boring.
Detroit,ffcppn1,t3_esj75k,1579804596.0,Most of my friends just don't like basketball. They literally wouldn't go to a game if they were given a $10 ticket. (I say that bc they'd ***probably*** go for free). Lions/Wings/Tigers they'd all go in heartbeat.
AutoChessMobile,ffcbgbc,t3_erk0sy,1579795831.0,huh. I was wondering if this was possible the other day and just never followed through on figuring it out
Detroit,ff99y1f,t1_ff806p1,1579708205.0,"I mean, don't you kinda think she memed herself with the bilboards etc?"
AutoChessMobile,ff99ofg,t1_ff99d4l,1579708037.0,oh I thought the second thing was a devastator. I struggle with counting.
Detroit,ff9923r,t1_ff83idy,1579707647.0,"> (2) some information on late night delivery (which app is the best?)  

is there an option other than doordash?"
Detroit,ff98wxh,t1_ff8afz0,1579707556.0,"I live in the Bagley neighborhood. I feel like most people I say that to aren't familiar. And it doesn't help that there's a big ole street named Bagley to confuse things.  
EDIT: a big street in a ***different*** location than the neighborhood."
Detroit,ff94qet,t1_ff8suon,1579704799.0,that user is still here. /u/bluelinehack I think?
Detroit,ff940sh,t1_ff91qgp,1579704312.0,"> Existing homeowners' tax bills won't jump significantly because state law caps yearly increases at the 2% rate of inflation. But those buying homes could pay more because the cap is lifted when a property is sold.  

EDIT: Also the assessed value is based on purchase price if I recall correctly. So, if I understand correctly, this article is very much talking about the price that homes are going for. There's no active change the city is making to how it assesses."

same, I've found this to be the most effective usage. Just turn it into a meat shield"
Detroit,fenu5ht,t1_fens1qq,1579290764.0,"My point is that this tweet basically amounts to spreading disinformation. That's what I have a problem with. I am also passionate about transit, and me and this dude are definitely on the same side. I just don't care this bs grandstanding."
Detroit,fenh78c,t1_fenh0vc,1579284613.0,oh no I was. I interacted with gp all the time. I mostly just understood he was trolling and thought he was pretty good at it.
Detroit,fen30ip,t1_fen2xfy,1579275844.0,"ah okay, I'm bad at jokes"
Detroit,fen1rjn,t1_femkvfv,1579275043.0,"yeah this guy (in the tweet) is just an asshole, everyone can feel free to ignore his bullshit."
Detroit,fen1j7w,t1_femkzv0,1579274894.0,Is this pictured or something? Or these are glasses you've seen him wear in the past? Cuz I'm looking for them in this pic and I must be tripping cuz I don't see any.

Detroit,fekjdj4,t1_fehjip6,1579201269.0,My buddy swears by this place as well. It's a little far for me personally though.

TheFlock,feh6bom,t1_feh38i4,1579110056.0,I didn't think I missed anything but I wasn't super familiar with them then. I met them through some ppl the next weekend at scamp and when I heard them play I was like yupppppp.
TheFlock,fegj6yg,t1_feeunbz,1579094413.0,"so, I do agree with a lot of this, but I don't think you're taking into account how big Pigeons are. I'd say Goose could be as big as Pigeons but it's going to take years to grow that much. I'm pretty sure Dave (Pigeons manager) recently started managing Goose as well, so they have a guy who knows how it all works, someone who has connections to help them grow as fast as their talent allows which is cool."
TheFlock,fegiw2w,t1_fegbr0x,1579094152.0,lol I missed them? I didn't know they were there. I watched the shit out of them at summercamp tho.
creepyPMs,fef1la0,t1_fef1dil,1579046027.0,Lol flex is kind a synonym of brag?

creepyPMs,feebncv,t1_feeb1r8,1579030429.0,yeah it's quite the flex.
creepyPMs,feeautq,t1_feeaqbn,1579029966.0,"oh wow I missed the part about the pics. But my question still stands about the admirer's name being One million, and that person loving the pictured dude times 1 million."
creepyPMs,feeaqx9,t1_fee8ojy,1579029902.0,I can only read text like that in a single run on breath without spaces it's the only way my brain can do it

Detroit,fee27is,t1_fee0fi0,1579024862.0,I think more often than not the announcers make the product worse. Turn off the sound and turn on some music for a much more enjoyable experience.
AutoChess,fedysai,t3_enyzwb,1579022742.0,These items are not super easy to come by. I do hunter builds pretty often and seem to have a way harder time making frantic masks alone. I maybe see one of these axes a game if it's late.
AutoChess,fedwmty,t1_fed03jh,1579021447.0,"I'm currently bishop 7 (top 1k at the moment) and I don't seem to have a problem pulling off one of those two every game. I just roll a few extra times early and level up quickly, and use whichever one is more available."
AutoChess,fedn2c6,t1_fed1jce,1579015522.0,interesting strategy...
AutoChessMobile,fedi1rx,t3_eoi5i6,1579012059.0,can someone explain (tldw)? I don't have 30 minutes to figure out where in this video it's covered

AutoChess,fdsh6hc,t1_fdsgmgv,1578702667.0,"I mean I would say, like in assassin's for instance, save an item, it throw one on soul breaker from the get go. Then if the item comes out put the next one on him too. Something like that, while still stacking your main carry. If the silence is still too much you'll have to use piece 9 and 10 on cc and hope"
creepyPMs,fdrkzk7,t3_elkkvo,1578686002.0,what is the shit drawn on there?
AutoChess,fdr8bul,t3_emllc0,1578680887.0,"Wouldn't the ""counter"" to this item to be not totally stack one unit? Like in assassins split your items, same with knights if you're h2h against a cloud halberd"
Detroit,fdr2q97,t1_fdot9mv,1578678743.0,these two dumbass bots have been infecting sub after sub. They should be banned. They just get into loops on tons of posts.

Detroit,fdr17z3,t3_emcnvh,1578678098.0,"It took me a long time to find a dentist I like and trust, I feel you on that. I go to Dr Levassuer (sp) in white lake on 59. He's good and conversational and makes you feel at ease while he's drilling the shit out of your skull."
creepyPMs,fdqzaj3,t1_fdp18cj,1578677266.0,I mean... we don't know that's NOT what he meant
creepyPMs,fdqz1bu,t3_emgtrj,1578677113.0,why is he quoting himself in his own message?? Like in this scenario this is ***his*** dialogue
ElectricForest,fdoi0zy,t1_fco3bd6,1578605552.0,"my buddy uses a wind sock pole. it's pretty dope and I think it telescopes, and basically weighs nothing. you can one-hand it or rest it on the ground.

Detroit,fdngvyk,t1_fdkvmgw,1578585542.0,I lived there 7 years as a professional and I never saw a single one other than hash bash (central campus) so I think my answer technically should be I don't know.

TIL... I always thought you had to drag all their asses onto the board... gotta have that apm to pull that off sometimes and get it back on the bench."
AutoChessMobile,fdhchn6,t1_fdgx12n,1578419916.0,so like 15 levels. that seems pretty in line with other ladder resets I've seen in other games.
