My niece just moved to Florida and her dog slipped out of the yard under the fence.  A small dog which has never bitten anyone.  It was immediately shot and killed by a neighbor who “felt threatened”.  My old neighbor shot and killed a neighbor’s fluffy flop earred bunny because it was on his property. 

There ABSOLUTELY are people in the gun community who openly talk about shooting people they disagree with including elected officials.  I’ve belonged to gun clubs (currently do) and years ago I quit a club because of such threats against me.  At that time I worked for the government fixing electronic lab equipment.  A fellow club member confronted me accused me of spying on him (because I was a “Fed”) and told me “you’ll be the first to get shot when it all goes down” he said this in front of witnesses.  I told the club but because he was a thirty year member, they did nothing.  He made other threatening comments about coming by my house so I quit.
