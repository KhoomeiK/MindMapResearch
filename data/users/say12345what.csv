This also does help to explain why the case is essentially cold and there do not appear to be any leads.  Obviously it is difficult to solve a murder where the killer has no (apparent) connection whatsoever to the victim.

As for the leap - true, but it does happen.  There are probably countless incidents where a burglar has been discovered in the course of a burglary and then he panics and kills the person. Also, some offenders do escalate their criminal behaviour from break and enter to other, more serious offences (although I think this was a case of the guy panicking or possibly getting a ""bonus"" to his fantasy by actually being able to use violence).

I agree with you on many points. I also wondered what Angela's lawyer's problem was with a marriage in Nigeria. That did not seem to make much sense.  It seems like he thought that anything done in a foreign country automatically makes things complicated.

I also agree that Michael's lawyer seemed very definitive in her advice. You have to wonder why that is. Over here lawyers usually give * advice *, not ""this is exactly what you must do"".  You make a good point that she may have been trying to push him in a more expensive direction.

I laughed when Mike said that information was classified. He must have meant that they could not tell him, but it certainly is not classified..."
90DayFiance,fc77qms,t1_fc627rk,1577499773.0,Well said.  This is all very true.
