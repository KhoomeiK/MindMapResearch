Psychonaut,fdzoqmu,t3_engr1g,1578792487.0,"Basically, instead of having the AI identity images, they had it create images (from my understanding of this article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.iflscience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence-dreams/  ). What gets me though is I feel like when you’re tripping, the environment looks a lot like these images... has me thinking...."

unpopularopinion,fdkzc7o,t3_els3xv,1578514272.0,Air travel isn’t natural. LCD screens aren’t natural. All the food you pollute your body with is unnatural. Playing God and killing animals for your own consumption isn’t natural. And couldn’t one argue that using any type of modern medicine “unnatural?” Isn’t keeping someone alive with chemo therapy playing God too?

Nails,fdg4srn,t3_el6b2a,1578380022.0,"They sell polishes like this but also you can put drops of white into a clear nail polish. Firstly make sure the clear bottle has a mixing bead in it. Also start with just one drop and from then add more white ( you could add nude or tan as well). If the mixture is too thick, and a few drops of acetone and mix well. Hope this helps!"

TrueOffMyChest,fctshkk,t3_eit641,1577957173.0,"I know how you feel. I met my best friend in a random encounter. It lead to us hanging out everyday, he became my soulmate. We were friends for two years and I had never been closer to anyone in my entire life. I started to develop a crush on him and was devastated. I thought that I would have to live the rest of my life with this intense crush on someone I could never have. He never showed any signs of having romantic feelings for me. It would crush me when he would go out on dates or think another girl was into him. Little did I know, he felt the exact same way. One night at a club, I kissed him when we were dancing together and he kissed me back. Things progressed and he soon asked me to be his girlfriend. 

We have been together for 6 months now. We have never had any fight, the sex is AMAZING, I’m so comfortable around him, and I know that I’m going to spend the rest of my life with my best friend.

I understand being afraid of losing her and being in pain watching her get another significant other if you don’t say anything. But I also understand the fear of messing up your friendship if you do... Honestly though, I would try to make a move. Give her little signs that you might like her. A lot of sustained (sexy) eye contact, respectful touching her thigh or back, and maybe like see if you could put your head on her shoulder or play with her hair. 

I wish you the best of luck! I just want you to know that there might be hope. Keep us posted plz!"

dating_advice,fc8dfh6,t3_eglc9q,1577532418.0,"This is so true. My mom has always told me this and I disregarded it. If you have insecurities within yourself and you’re in a relationship, they manifest. You start to question if you’re enough because you don’t love yourself enough to know that your significant other loves you for you. And also, mom would say “confidence is sexy.” It’s so true, I know when I’m having an ugly day my boyfriend can tell, but on other days if I just push through it and make myself feel sexy, he’s soooo much more attracted to me."
