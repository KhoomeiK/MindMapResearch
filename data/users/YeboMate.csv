MicrosoftFlow,ffb1hdt,t3_esjj48,1579749440.0,"Not specific to Flows but in general keep this in mind.

It's about where you want to shift the complexity. Having one Flow means the complexity lies within the process (and with you) whereas having multiple smaller Flows means you're shifting the complexity to the users (in knowing which Flow to run).

If in your case, it's easier to manage the complexity on your end then go for it. If it's easier to manage the complexity with the users (e.g. via training) then go for it.

&#x200B;

Other aspects to consider along with where to shift the complexity are testing and the ability to have someone else pick up and understand what you've built.

Imagine you leaving the role and someone else had to pick it up, what would it be like for them to understand your Flow(s) if they were in one large Flow vs multiple smaller Flows.

&#x200B;

Hopefully this helps."

My advice would be to be yourself and be genuinely interested in others. This could be (like another person mentioned) asking your colleagues for recommendations (best place for coffee, lunch, drinks etc). 

Also know your passion and hopefully you get to work on stuff that will show your passion. If you can then you‚Äôll be by default excited and this will draw others‚Äô attention towards you.

I personally do this with my work. I run what I do all through Teams as I have my own way of managing the information. For business areas (internal) I engage with that are proficient with using Teams I invite them to the Team and we work from there. 
With business areas that are not so used to using new technology, I simply share the URL of the files they need and they can access them either using Excel/Word online or just their desktop app (if they have Office 365 version installed). 
They still get to collaborate but they just don‚Äôt get to see the architecture of the information. 

If the file is within a Channel:
What Teams is doing is simply storing that spreadsheet (Excel file) on the team‚Äôs SharePoint Site. Then Teams simply opens that file up within Excel Online but as one of the tabs in the channel.

As others have mentioned, if you don‚Äôt like your job... find another one you enjoy. Don‚Äôt just go for the money (though you may go through a phase of chasing the money or fame and that‚Äôs okay, but let it be a phase), do something you enjoy. 

As pointed out, money isn‚Äôt everything so cherish relationships you form whether it be partner or friends. 
As another person pointed out, you‚Äôre no longer in a ‚Äòclosed‚Äô system so opportunities to meet someone in a similar situation is now less. 
A plus side to this is that everyone you meet now all have had an interesting story up until now so don‚Äôt be quick to jump to assumptions. 

And personally I‚Äôll say this (because I did just this), don‚Äôt compare yourself to others or with classmates of the same year etc. Everyone has their own path, everyone has their own interests and motives. Know yours and stick to them and you‚Äôll more satisfied than if you did things with the intention of being able to compare and brag.
