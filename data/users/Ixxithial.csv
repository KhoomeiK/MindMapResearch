Happens if you're stressing out the program too much or, in my case, if a save gets corrupt. Can get rather annoying if it happens too often but so far the occurrences have been rare. I just gotta be careful not to screw around too much in the console or ENB config as well as not add or remove too many mods on one save. Also try not to keep reloading to a previous point as that can cause a CTD. Save regularly through the menu as those will be important points to go back to should you get a corrupt save file.
