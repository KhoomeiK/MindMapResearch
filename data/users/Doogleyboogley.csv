explainlikeimfive,ff7fodm,t1_ff6v4up,1579648470.0,"It was early in the morning on a Tuesday. The sun had just come up over the crest of the hill, half bathing the open field in front of me a golden yellow. I was lucky enough to be able to see for miles looking over the top of the next town, which sat in a bowl, and about two more towns after that dotted across the countryside. The sun was just about to rise enough to start defrosting the tallest chimneys and Ariels. Something caught my eye and they flicked to the furthest town to my left, I noticed a point of light shining directly at me like it was trying to get my attention or warn me or something the town had a black cloud over it, it was only small and I thought would stand no chance against the beaming sun but then then my eyes automatically flicked to the town in the bowl it seemed darker than it should be? Within an instant the cloud seemed to have cover a massive distance and moved over the town quite low but the sun hadnâ€™t reached it yet so I just presumed that thatâ€™s all it was, the sun hadnâ€™t done itâ€™s job yet but was well on its way to. Out of interest I looked at the other little town I could see, as I glanced at it I watched them one by one as the street lights that lined the country road leading along the side of the hill went out. I chuckled to myself thinking even the electricity must be chilly this morning, then I noticed what looked like that black cloud jump from the top of one street lamp then the next, then to the next. Suddenly the whole town went dark as every single light in the village went out, as it did the cloud lifted high into the sky and started getting larger and larger, either that or it was getting closer? I patted myself down to find my phone to check the time, after checking every pocket, then checking the first pocket I checked (which it was obviously in) I pressed the unlock button and was nearly blinded as the screen light up. After a second my eyes adjusted to the light and as they did I looked up, my eyes widened, I took a step back then crooked my neck trying to look up more! Suddenly a column came flying out of the cloud and shot over my shoulder it wrapped itself around the lamppost blocking out the only other source of light!, then another shot out and  knocked my phone out my hand on to the ground face up, the screen ONLY illuminating the massive cloud which had descended right on top of me! It canâ€™t have been anymore than a seconds but that was the longest second of my life I saw in slow motion as moths ripped their own heads of and threw them at me one after the other trying to get to the light source! It turned out ok though i just pressed the lock button and the screen turned off and they left.
Sorry it just gets to me when people say theyâ€™re not sure if they should be scared, they 100% should maybe be."
