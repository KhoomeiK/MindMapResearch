SuicideWatch,fdbvzsu,t1_fdbuull,1578262735.0,You’re right. It is probably just my mind doing this to me. But it just feels so awful that I don’t even want to try living. It feels so difficult to get through the day without thinking that I’m so awful and horrible and that I don’t deserve to live.
SuicideWatch,fdburii,t1_fdbtc2y,1578262280.0,"I have, and they said the same thing too, but whenever I talk to my therapist, or anyone for that matter I can’t seem to really express these thoughts or feelings. I hate myself when I can’t, and when I do express them they always appear at the most inconvenient times and ruins get togethers, parties, etc."
SuicideWatch,fd5lg8l,t3_ejysqk,1578178734.0,"I feel this so much!! For the longest while I’ve been planning to die, but I always coward out or delay because I’m scared. Plus, whenever I look up methods, I just freak out at seeing the amount of pain people are expected to endure if they do them, and the likelihood that you end up surviving in the end."
AskReddit,fctmsqr,t1_fct1ezk,1577949324.0,Sounds like a description of r/TheMonkeysPaw
CasualConversation,fctmqzn,t3_eipy4z,1577949260.0,"Honestly, I did the same thing too this year. I get so stressed out over friends not responding to me and wondering if I said something wrong that I just need a break. Social media just turns into an anxiety-riddled experience, and if it's not helping you, then you don't need it. Cheers to no social media!"
CasualConversation,falugy5,t1_fal9hdd,1576190661.0,"I’m planning to, as soon as my classes are done."
