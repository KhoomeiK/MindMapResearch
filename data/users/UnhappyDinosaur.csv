MakeupSelfies,ffjfy9e,t1_ffjerbz,1579997426.0,No ofc! I’m the same with my brows and it’s causing more problems than I thought lol but yeah the color is a great match for you too. I hope the foundation truck works out!
MakeupSelfies,ffjco3g,t1_ffj6gn1,1579995499.0,I second this! If anything you could try applying the foundation with a foundation brush and then blend it out with a sponge. I also love the brows
riskofrain,ffh5ojf,t3_etialg,1579923809.0,This is such great work!!! I hope you post more! Always wanted to cross stitch but I nap too much for that lol
cleancarts,ffgzmlk,t1_ffgygwu,1579919174.0,"Yeah. On the original post I linked more photos of the packaging. It’s 1,100 MG"
fakecartridges,ffgybqi,t1_ffgv9eb,1579918201.0,Yeah it’s rough over here. I definitely need to learn more about flower first. I started on carts so it’s all new to me. Thank you for helping out
cleancarts,ffgjxc2,t1_ffghx7k,1579907945.0,When I search online there’s NorCal cannabis that seems to be a more prominent brand. Do you know if you saw botanicals?
fakecartridges,ffgjuxg,t1_ffgj89l,1579907901.0,I know that they were picked up in Colorado but I don’t doubt they were made somewhere else. The packaging itself is from a website called microvials that seems to be expensive? I guess this is the better option since those cartoon ones are EVERYWHERE but I’m still sus. Like I would trust my guy to not knowingly give me something bad but he could also not know. He takes trips to CO 2x a month to get them. I’ve already used 2 before checking here and there was nothing super off about them that I could notice
cleancarts,ffgcxa2,t1_ffgcosx,1579903455.0,"I appreciate it. 

Is there anything about the packaging that makes it come off as fake? Someone on my other post said the THC percentage shouldn’t be displayed but on the beginner thread I think it said the carts were supposed to have it? 

I wanna know what to look out for."
cleancarts,ffgcax5,t1_ffgc0yg,1579903074.0,"I mean the guy is a childhood friend I just didn’t know if it was relevant, but I understand that despite your connections you can still end up with fake stuff. I wish it was easier to just find out. I unfortunately have already used 2 of them before checking."
cleancarts,ffgbtn6,t1_ffgbp1l,1579902782.0,FL but the dude went to CO to get it.
cleancarts,ffg8fpu,t1_ffg8c3h,1579900705.0,Do you know anything about this brand? Like if it’s available in certain states etc.
cleancarts,ffg7jsg,t3_cn2658,1579900155.0,Do you have any info on NorCal botanics? Not much on the internet about them. I also just made a post that has some information but I’m new to this

fakecartridges,ffg4srz,t1_ffg431y,1579898462.0,Could you go into more detail so I know what to look out for in the future. I only know to avoid those weird cartoony looking ones but I’m very new to what’s fake or real when it comes to this type of packaging

Paid $45. Person obtained them from Colorado apparently. 

So far I haven’t noticed any negative affects on my health and they do have a pretty dank smell. 

Obviously I’m not going to continue to use but maybe the above could be helpful.

Could you explain more about the percentage on the sticker?"

internetparents,ffcg12e,t1_ffcfujw,1579798668.0,"I would also suggest the Nuvaring as it is less painful and you only worry about it once a month. And no the guys don’t feel it when you’re together lol

stevenuniverse,ffa821s,t3_esco8u,1579729697.0,Haven’t been able to watch SUF but I just rewatched SU and saw the movie for the first time.

I feel like there’s so much you could expand on without it getting old.
MakeupEducation,ffa5o62,t1_ff8khh0,1579728375.0,There’s a double ended eyeliner pen from Ciate that works pretty well!! Normally I’m skeptical of them bc they dry out fast but I like this one a lot
Dermatology,ffa4ui6,t1_ffa4hkw,1579727912.0,Yeah. I agree with the others on seeing a derm but first step would prob be to have a more gentle routine and a good moisturizer. Idk where you’re at but considering that looks to be razor burn/ingrown hairs. I really like Dr. Jart Cicapair for itchy and red spots.

I remember seeing some people on here or another sub saying it isn’t good to consume the stuff in carts but it’s okay to smoke bc of the form it’s in and stuff. I’m really not too educated I just know (for the most part) which ones won’t kill me lol"

BadMUAs,fegyx0n,t1_fegyqxv,1579105611.0,"For my own education here, if the MUA chose a lighter shade of the foundation to try and make up for the oxidizing wouldn’t it still come off as orange no matter how light?"
weddingshaming,fegxwpn,t1_fegrabd,1579104982.0,I also feel like the toss was to rub it in the other girls faces too. Like she turns around and looks at them kinda showing she doesn’t even care that she hurt someone in the process of getting it
BadMUAs,fegxkit,t1_feglszv,1579104772.0,"I’m probably blind, I know that the color is off but I don’t think it’s insanely off like it was done on purpose. Couldnt this be the foundation oxidizing?"
SkincareFlatlays,feglm9n,t1_fegldfx,1579096552.0,"The only other option I can think of is that the sebum/dirt was “brought to the surface” but from my understanding BHAs are supposed to dissolve.

SkincareFlatlays,fegl36c,t1_fegks0p,1579096112.0,"Do you think it could have been an allergic reaction? I’m not toooo experienced with BHAs but since they’re designed to unclog pores I would figure it couldn’t clog them due to the acid.

cleancarts,fdqxfo6,t3_ekjdpd,1578676185.0,Not sure if this is what you have but a friend of mine had some illness called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. She got it like 6 months ago and has most of the symptoms that you’re describing. Apparently due to an overload of cannabinoids(?) in her system. She can’t even eat anything that contains it now.

SkincareAddicts,fdcxh19,t3_ekf0w1,1578287194.0,I had something similar to this on my upper arm and it went away when I scrubbed with a loofah. If you’ve had it for as long as you remember it’s probably hyperpigmentation like the others say

Dermatology,fczlvjk,t3_ejpmpp,1578104071.0,NAD but my bf has tinea versicolor and this looks very similar. You should schedule a dermatologist appointment. It’s a fungus that grows on the skin and isn’t contagious but it can cause uneven skin tone as the fungus prevents sunlight to reach the skin
Dermatology,fcydp6o,t1_fcydmcn,1578078502.0,I hope it works! Update us if you can :)
Dermatology,fcyakgj,t1_fcy7adp,1578077184.0,"I scrub with soap and a loofah(the cheap ones you see around supermarkets and such), then I use a (tree hut) sugar scrub or any type of physical exfoliator could work and I really scrub, apply conditioner, and shave. Afterwards I apply a moisturizer but vitamin e oil works well too.

I do this/shave once a week. I wouldn’t recommend doing it frequently cause it could make your skin super raw and sensitive. 

Also not wearing super tight/frictional clothes helps. No matter how well I prep I will always get razor burn in the bikini area if I’m wearing something like tight jeans when the hairs start to grow back.

Edit: more information"
Dermatology,fcy57cx,t1_fcvarwz,1578075000.0,I’ve noticed that the hair follicles(?) on my upper thighs react differently when I shave and are more prone to razor burn if I don’t prep properly. This might not be the case for you of course but it just seems like stubborn razor burn. Have you spoken about it to a doctor before?
Dermatology,fcxqvdm,t1_fcx13ri,1578069268.0,Pores do not open/close. They are more visible sometimes when filled with sebum or other things like dirt. Hot water on the skin would also dry it out and probably further irritate what’s happening.
