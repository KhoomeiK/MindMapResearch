The rest of your comment literally counteracts this. 

And here's my solution to all of this: tax evasion is treated the same as theft of the same value. If you fail to pay a million in taxes, then that gets the same jail time as stealing a million dollars' worth of diamonds. 

To be honest, the punishment should be worse since you didn't steal from an individual; you stole from the country, and thereby it's treasonous.  

If tax evaders choose to leave the country, just let them. They're scum and deserve no pity. They have the means to contribute, but refuse to, which makes them sociopathic trash."

And besides, capital gains is only levied on realized profits, ie. when you cash out. At that point, it's just income and should be taxed that way. 

I'll reiterate: if you bought a plot of land, planted trees, and then sold the forest 20 years later, you would be taxed once. If you daytraded trees, you would be taxed for every sale."

People already don't understand progressive taxation, so making it more complicated isn't really an argument, and we have the computational power to have a simple calculator that anyone can use. Enter income, effective tax rate pops out.

It's the only surefire way to reduce income inequality at the extremes. Someone earning 10 million has functionally the same tax rate as someone earning 1 billion, yet it's not the first guy whose wealth truly distorts the balance of power. 

In essence, why can't we have a 99.2% rate on earnings over a billion?"

Bananas in Europe, oranges and tomatoes during winter, driving - all these things go away or are reserved for the rich. iPhones made in China, gone. Hell, meat goes away.

It's a hard sell. Denial is easier, because the scope of the disaster beggars belief. Yearly hurricanes, droughts that turn vast swathes of land into desert. The Gulf Stream stopping, turning northern Europe into a frigid tundra. Heat waves going over 50 degrees in China and India for months on end. 2 billion people displaced in the next 3 decades. Billion with a B. Entire countries rendered uninhabitable.

I don't think we'll fix it. Sure, we'll make token efforts, maybe put a 10% tax on imports, subsidize green energy and electric cars, ban straws. But, I think humanity is incapable of cutting our lifestyle not just until it bleeds, but to the fucking bone.

It was a brilliant piece of propaganda work, though. By calling everyone in GG misogynistic neckbeards the entire situation was defused because identity is more important than fact nowadays.

I maintain that being overtly hostile towards those who are in the middle of that growing up doesn't help. It just pushes them towards those that do empathize, leading them to toxic groups like incels or redpills - both of whom overshot the lesson in opposite directions.
