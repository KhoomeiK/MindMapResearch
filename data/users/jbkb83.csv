Now, although I was born in Australia, I've lived in the UK since I was 2 and have a British accent. Also, I'd only said a few words to her at this point. So I say, that's weird, yes I am!

She asks where I was born. I tell her, Melbourne. 

She asks literally where, which hospital. I tell her, the old Victoria hospital, it's long since been demolished.  

She (more intently now) asks, oh my god, how old are you?  

I'm a little perturbed by this point. I tell her, I'm 20.   

Turns out, she was a midwife at that hospital 20 years ago, and she most probably helped deliver me. O-o"

Positive self care: Eating healthy meals, exercising, getting up and going to bed at regular times, going out and seeing my friends etc. All these things feel very hard but pretty much always makes me feel better."

datingoverthirty,fcywzon,t1_fcyu11r,1578088923.0,"Disappointment is a big part of dating, that's for sure. 

In terms of instigating, I nearly always messaged first, when I was on dating apps. I'd say 80%+ of the first dates I went on, I sent the first message. I am ALL for women sending the first message.  

However, I do think the best approach once you're chatting, and on the early stages of dating, is to let the guy lead. It's not about playing games, although on first glance it might seem that way. It's the easiest way of assessing their genuine level of interest. If a guy wants to meet up, he will plan it. If he doesn't plan it, he's not that into you.  

... Possible exceptions I've come across are that he's too lazy/disorganised to arrange a date (I don't want to date someone like that), he's too wrapped up in something else in his life to take the initiative (fair enough, but you're therefore not in the same place), or he's got so little confidence he won't ask you out, despite you giving him every indication you are interested (this doesn't make him a bad person, but dating someone with zero confidence isn't my choice). 

I used to ask men out and take the initiative. It didn't work for me. Leaning back and letting them pursue me, worked for me. Can't help but tell every woman to try that approach, just to see what happens!"
datingoverthirty,fcyvq2c,t1_fcyst9g,1578088119.0,"I see your point in theory, but I'm just saying what I've observed, from a lot of experience (e.g. I went all out in 2018 and went on about 80 dates). It's not dumb, it's an approach that works for me and for many, many women. 

I can't comment on how gay women interact on dating apps. I'm talking about straight men and straight women, because that's my experience.  

The feminist in me finds it annoying, tbh, that letting men pursue me has worked far better than the other way around... but I do think that it holds up for the majority of the time. I'd be an idiot to ignore my own experience, which is: when I stopped pursuing men and setting up dates, and mirrored their interest, dating became so much easier. It started every interaction on the right foot, because I was confident in their interest in me (to plan a date in advance, message first to follow up) and they were confident that I was interested in them, by accepting, and replying quickly.  

I showed men that I was enthusiastic and interested by messaging first (I'd say 80-90% of the first dates I've been on, have been with men I messaged first). If they didn't ask me out and plan a date, after I'd messaged them first, had some enthusiastic back and forth conversation, given them my number, etc. I think it's fair to say they weren't that interested.  

Once you've known someone for a little while, it evens out. I planned my now boyfriend's and my fourth date, I think. We now plan stuff mostly equally (in fact, I probably plan a bit more).  

Fair enough if you don't agree. I'd advocate all women trying this approach, though, and seeing for themselves. Can't hurt, and it truly made dating easy and fun for me."

datingoverthirty,fcykuw9,t1_fcy46ed,1578081851.0,"Absolutely. I'd add: if you are interested/excited to meet someone, you don't leave it all up in the air. You just don't. So it's not just an indication of bad communication and poor manners, it's a clear indication that they're not all that interested in you."
datingoverthirty,fcykhcb,t1_fcy9l1f,1578081648.0,"I think men have a hard time at online dating, overall (going by many discussions I've had with men about it).  

I can see what you mean about not coming off as desperate, but the majority of women love it when a guy they're interested in (i.e. Have already had some positive interaction with) requests a date with them in advance. A man who asks you early in the week what you're doing that Friday or Saturday night, and then suggests a time and place to meet - that's confident and attractive. If a woman was put off by that, I'd assume she wasn't looking to actually go on dates, just chat to men for an ego boost. 

I tended to give men the benefit of the doubt when I was online dating, but behaviour I did find desperate was more along the lines of over sharing very personal stuff, sending too many messages (as in, 10-15 texts over the course of an hour, before I'd had a chance to read and respond to the first message), or professing how much they liked me before we'd even met."
datingoverthirty,fcyj2zk,t1_fcy5dti,1578080908.0,"You have a point - some people are planners, some aren't. But in dating, a reluctance to plan in advance is a pretty solid sign that the person isn't really that interested in you.  

Plus, when you're 30+ with hobbies and work and friends etc. you need to book stuff in to make it happen. Everyone should know this. The alternative is never having dates booked, which means you don't meet anyone. Or cancelling your own stuff last minute for a date, which is lame and makes them think you have no life. Or, worst of all, keeping your schedule empty in case someone asks you out. Depressing. I know, because I've done these things haha

My now boyfriend is not much of a planner. He likes to do things more spontaneously, depending on how he's feeling, how tired he is, the weather, etc. I'm very much a planner, mainly because I have two jobs and several hobbies that book up my time.  

When we were first dating, I told him (nicely) that I needed a few day's notice to free up time for us to go out. This was the truth, not a game playing tactic. His non-planning self planned a LOT of nice dates for us, and always at least 3 days in advance. In the first stages of dating, it really does make a difference. 

Now we're together, we've met in the middle. He suggests fun short notice stuff for us to do, if we know we'll be together but don't have anything particular planned. I'll suggest future things that we'd both like to do, and arrange things/buy tickets. I actually think it works really well, he says he likes being made to be a bit more proactive and booking some fun stuff in, I say I think it does my control freak self good to do things at short notice :)"
datingoverthirty,fcygkdv,t3_eji1aq,1578079754.0,"I often tell my single guy friends, 'Women love it when the guy makes the plans' - not because 'men have to lead', or because we women are too lazy or apathetic to come up with plans... but because it's a pretty sure fire way of gauging his interest level in the beginning. If he's interested, he'll make plans in advance to see you. No guess work needed.  

Similarly, you'll read a lot about 'mirroring' a guy's interest level, to see clearly how into you he is. This approach helped me a lot because it makes it *very* clear who is keen, who is sort of into you but inconsistent, and who is using you as a back up or last minute booty call. It saves you from investing too much energy into someone who's not that invested in you. 

Letting guys plan and mirroring/not initiating sounded pretty reductive, until I tried it. It made dating a hell of a lot easier and more fun for me."

datingoverthirty,fcykuw9,t1_fcy46ed,1578081851.0,"Absolutely. I'd add: if you are interested/excited to meet someone, you don't leave it all up in the air. You just don't. So it's not just an indication of bad communication and poor manners, it's a clear indication that they're not all that interested in you."
datingoverthirty,fcykhcb,t1_fcy9l1f,1578081648.0,"I think men have a hard time at online dating, overall (going by many discussions I've had with men about it).  

I can see what you mean about not coming off as desperate, but the majority of women love it when a guy they're interested in (i.e. Have already had some positive interaction with) requests a date with them in advance. A man who asks you early in the week what you're doing that Friday or Saturday night, and then suggests a time and place to meet - that's confident and attractive. If a woman was put off by that, I'd assume she wasn't looking to actually go on dates, just chat to men for an ego boost. 

I tended to give men the benefit of the doubt when I was online dating, but behaviour I did find desperate was more along the lines of over sharing very personal stuff, sending too many messages (as in, 10-15 texts over the course of an hour, before I'd had a chance to read and respond to the first message), or professing how much they liked me before we'd even met."
datingoverthirty,fcyj2zk,t1_fcy5dti,1578080908.0,"You have a point - some people are planners, some aren't. But in dating, a reluctance to plan in advance is a pretty solid sign that the person isn't really that interested in you.  

Plus, when you're 30+ with hobbies and work and friends etc. you need to book stuff in to make it happen. Everyone should know this. The alternative is never having dates booked, which means you don't meet anyone. Or cancelling your own stuff last minute for a date, which is lame and makes them think you have no life. Or, worst of all, keeping your schedule empty in case someone asks you out. Depressing. I know, because I've done these things haha

My now boyfriend is not much of a planner. He likes to do things more spontaneously, depending on how he's feeling, how tired he is, the weather, etc. I'm very much a planner, mainly because I have two jobs and several hobbies that book up my time.  

When we were first dating, I told him (nicely) that I needed a few day's notice to free up time for us to go out. This was the truth, not a game playing tactic. His non-planning self planned a LOT of nice dates for us, and always at least 3 days in advance. In the first stages of dating, it really does make a difference. 

Now we're together, we've met in the middle. He suggests fun short notice stuff for us to do, if we know we'll be together but don't have anything particular planned. I'll suggest future things that we'd both like to do, and arrange things/buy tickets. I actually think it works really well, he says he likes being made to be a bit more proactive and booking some fun stuff in, I say I think it does my control freak self good to do things at short notice :)"
datingoverthirty,fcygkdv,t3_eji1aq,1578079754.0,"I often tell my single guy friends, 'Women love it when the guy makes the plans' - not because 'men have to lead', or because we women are too lazy or apathetic to come up with plans... but because it's a pretty sure fire way of gauging his interest level in the beginning. If he's interested, he'll make plans in advance to see you. No guess work needed.  

Similarly, you'll read a lot about 'mirroring' a guy's interest level, to see clearly how into you he is. This approach helped me a lot because it makes it *very* clear who is keen, who is sort of into you but inconsistent, and who is using you as a back up or last minute booty call. It saves you from investing too much energy into someone who's not that invested in you. 

Letting guys plan and mirroring/not initiating sounded pretty reductive, until I tried it. It made dating a hell of a lot easier and more fun for me."

aww,fcxsfsy,t3_ejgf12,1578069780.0,"This happened to my friend Debbie with a very similar looking dog, when a group of us were having lunch. The dog was with its owner at the next table, and was yapping and yapping, from the second we sat down. It was starting to get a little annoying, but we're all dog lovers so we turned around and started chatting with the owner, whose name was Dave, and fussing over the dog, whose name was Daisy. 

Dave was really friendly, and we're all telling him that we're on holiday together. Meanwhile, lil' Daisy kept pulling at her lead, which finally slipped away from Dave's grasp. Daisy makes a beeline for Debbie, leaps onto her lap, curls up and immediately shuts up. She's all cosy and happy. We were all jealous of Debbie! 

Dave, Daisy and Debbie. I wish I could say that Dave and Debbie are now married 😂"

AskReddit,fcw01az,t1_fcuernx,1578014009.0,"Success *absolutely* can be defined as finding a place that makes you happy! The older I get, the more I realise that you have to live by your own standards in life, not other people's (and I know that's easier said than done).  

I 'gave up' on my dream career in my mid twenties because I found something more realistic, that made me content every day, and very happy most of the time... As opposed to what I was pursuing, which was all highs and lows and higher stakes and pressure.  

For so long, I was ashamed of telling people I'd given up - I felt like such a failure. My old teachers expressed disappointment, for sure. There was talk of 'wasting my potential'. My family and friends were surprised, as I'd very much built my persona around my first career. A few people told me, 'I really thought you'd make it, I never thought you would quit.' But I slowly started just owning the decision. Quitting is okay, if you are choosing another path.  

I'm in my mid thirties now, and I have a good life, my own home, a job I enjoy. I wish I hadn't wasted all that energy feeling ashamed of being' a quitter'.  

Spending too much time stressing about what others think can be really damaging. Do what's right for you. It's your life and you only get one."

AskReddit,fb64qfa,t3_ebdhav,1576541342.0,"It depends. I don't go out of my way to flirt, but my natural way of interacting is to joke, be warm, smiley, tactile etc. - all things that can be interpreted as flirtatious, but I generally just mean to be friendly. If I'm comfortable, I can act that way.  

If I'm attracted, I'm usually nervous, so not comfortable enough to consciously flirt. This has lead to some interesting situations, including me getting flustered whilst talking to my crush, and drawing on my face by mistake with the pen I was holding. Heh."
