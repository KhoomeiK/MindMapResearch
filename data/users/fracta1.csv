Those days are behind me. I take one before bed each night to help my sleep and anxiety. You can easily make your own edibles, I just don't like to do that because I want a consistent amount each night. Also they're 10mg, and to  someone whose life doesn't revolve around smoking that's plenty strong enough to get you high."
