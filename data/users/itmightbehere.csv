instantkarma,ff3fexs,t1_ff38zin,1579539950.0,"Sad story time. My dad shot a blow gun at a kitten when he was a kid and hit it. His mom found it three days later, dying, with the dart still in its little belly. She made him put it out of its misery.

I can tell you he never did it again, and he spent the rest of his life making it up as best he could to other animals. He'd get choked up about it any time he told the story.

Sometimes, people don't empathize with animals. They almost forget that they're living beings who can suffer. There are definitely people who will torture an animal without a care in the world, but some people just need to be confronted by what they've done.

When I was a kid, he'd hunt from time to time. The last time he ever went hunting, he missed the clean shot and had to chase it down while it was screaming. He put it out of its misery after it got stuck on a fence. After that, he couldn't do it anymore. Killing a deer at a distance was one thing, looking it in its eyes while he put it down was another thing. This obviously wasn't the same situation - humans have killed off the deer's natural predators, so we have to keep their numbers down, and we ate the meat. But it reminded him of that kitten."

PublicFreakout,fcqhr0j,t1_fcqajcp,1577886215.0,"My dad was an alcoholic and my mom is an enabler. He tried to get sober many times throughout my childhood, but it only ever lasted a few months at a time - because he knew that my mom would be there to clean up his messes and he didn't want to get clean. He hated himself and his life and the alcohol let him forget.

He was also suicidal and OCD, and towards the end of his drinking, his collection/hoard of choice was guns. One night, mom and I hear a sound like a broom falling on the floor. Mom walked into the bedroom to find a hole in the ceiling and him with a gun pointed at his own head. She locked herself in the room with him and told me to call 911. Everything turned out okay but that memory still kills me, and it's been about 10 years now.

After that, mom finally told him no. She'd been staying because she was stuck and because she thought her kill himself if she left. But that was the last straw. His choices were get clean or be on his own, no matter what that meant. He got clean, and he stayed that way the rest of his life. He still had a lot of problems, but not that one.

I'm normally a pushover and like to avoid conflict.

You lose your ability to adapt to change as you get older, which is probably a huge reason our society is as stable as it is, but also can lead to stagnation and corruption when change is better for the majority. There'd be less time to hoard resources, so communities would have to work together more closely than they do now to really get anywhere. There's a lot of wisdom that more years gets you, as you get older and slower and have more time to really think about your experiences. The loss of that would really suck.
