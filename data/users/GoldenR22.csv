fatlogic,ffftely,t1_fffddpv,1579891397.0,Sounds like you've already lost some extra weight!
fatlogic,fffr1k0,t1_ff6es12,1579889936.0,"Instead of being harder on yourself, try being kinder. It's the kind thing to treat your body well by providing it good, healthy fuel and keeping it strong and fit. I don't go to the gym or eat healthy food because I hate my body, I go because I love it and don't want it to be in unnecessary pain."
loseit,ffe11ln,t1_ffdps1x,1579833931.0,"Broccoli, salads, soups, water. Idk man a 1/2 pound of carrots and hummus is pretty filling for me but you are doing a lot of exercise!"
loseit,ffdp03q,t3_et1maa,1579825563.0,Fellow vegan here! If it's just hunger there's lot of low calorie snacks that you can eat as long as it doesn't upset your stomach. Obviously high fiber foods and lots of water will help but it seems you've had to cut down on the fiber. I would say that 24 oz of water isn't a ton and you could add more of that. Maybe find some volume foods that won't hurt your stomach? Would popcorn work? Or soup and salad always fills me up.
loseit,ffdar1j,t3_eszvv4,1579816817.0,I would do a week of tracking calories strictly just to get a really accurate baseline of where you're at and then adjust as necessary by increasing snacks or sub real food for shake
loseit,ffd8ny1,t3_esw63g,1579815582.0,You can also mix teas for more flavor. I usually have plain gunpowder green tea but I'll add a mint medley tea bag if I want an easy mint green tea.
loseit,ffd8gg7,t1_ffd0hft,1579815460.0,"Teas have different temps and brew times based on the kind. Herbal teas are pretty much the only ones that can be boiled and brewed indefinitely without turning bitter, the flavor will just get stronger the longer it sits."
loseit,ffd80r4,t1_ffcl1lk,1579815211.0,Even 180F and 2-3 minutes is pushing it! I brew loose leaf gunpowder green tea and never go above 175F and usually no more than a minute brew time personally.
nutrition,ffcqe0l,t3_eslrag,1579805040.0,If you want a powdered smoothie type drink then I would recommend Vega One shakes for nutrition.
loseit,ff9qlsc,t1_ff9nves,1579718817.0,Yep! You can easily gain 3-5 lbs of extra water weight over your period. Happened to me too and then immediately dropped the weight once my period was over.
loseit,ff9qcpu,t3_esg0be,1579718634.0,I've really liked the body for life program. It even has cardio days which you could do the elliptical on but it uses HIIT to burn more. You can adjust the weight to fit you and you can do it all with free weights which is nice.

relationship_advice,feodbdg,t1_fenkkiq,1579298606.0,"Can you write her a note? PTSD affects the parts of our brain responsible for speech production. It can be very difficult to verbally express yourself at times but I've found that texting or writing something helps a lot. Having a good, supportive partner can make a world of difference when dealing with PTSD and it's really something that needs to be dealt with. You're not weak, or a pussy, you're a human being who was hurt and is scared. That's okay to be, and it doesn't detract from your manhood."
loseit,fencm0f,t3_eq2bgl,1579281815.0,"Restrictive diets can be tricky and unsustainable. With that being said, I'm vegan and I know a lot of people think the same thing about my diet even though I find it easy and with a lot of variety.

I also don't think all calories are equal when it comes to health and reducing alcohol, sugar, and dairy should help reduce inflammation in the body. However, complex carbs are part of a balanced diet and you may want to consider adding in whole wheat pasta, brown rice, sweet potatoes, and quinoa. These foods are high in fiber which will help you feel full longer. 

At the end of the day, it depends a bit on your goals. Are you looking just to lose weight (no need to restrict groups of food) or be healthier overall (limiting consumption of inflammatory foods such as dairy and sugar and alcohol)? What feels better to your body and sustainable? A diet that is causing mental breakdowns isn't healthy or sustainable."

AskReddit,felo8bd,t1_felo3ks,1579226906.0,I don't think I cook mine long enough because I get impatient! But we've had it as a bbq replacement a few times and it's good enough.
AskReddit,felmx1e,t1_felexrs,1579226004.0,"FYI, you can freeze them whole when they're ripe and use them later for guac or spreads. It changes the texture a bit but it's fine. Just thaw in water."
AskReddit,felmkvd,t1_felborh,1579225775.0,Did you get the young green jackfruit in brine? That's the kind you need for the meat substitutes and then you drain and rinse it with water. It tastes like a light artichoke on it's own. Pretty bland honestly but if you add bbq sauce and let it cook for a long while then it's okay.
loseit,fel6cou,t1_fekkabk,1579215012.0,"I use a feelings and needs sheet from non violent communication. It's hard for me to verbalize my feelings and being able to pick it out of a line up is much easier. It also has basic needs and once I have the feeling I can tie it to the underlying need a lot easier. For example, when I'm feeling overwhelmed and want to eat it might mean that I want more control over the situation that's bothering me. Or if I'm feeling scared about something then I might really want security and to feel safe. There's lots of different strategies besides emotional eating to meet those needs."
loseit,fekic28,t1_fekgh92,1579200646.0,"It won't make you feel the same way, just something to make you feel a bit better that is healthier. Maybe a combo of things. It could be listening to your favorite music while colouring in a mandala colouring book, going for a hike, doing a meditation or yoga, taking CBD if you're having bad anxiety, a hug from a family member or friend, etc. Think of your food binges like an alcohol binge, it might make me you feel better emotionally quickly but then how does your body feel? What's the lasting impact? Yeah, going for a walk might not feel as good emotionally as binging but it will make you feel better the next day or in a couple of hours. 

Also, really sit with how you feel and think about what you're needing. I had to do a lot of work to be able to process my emotions fully. I usually used food as a bandaid or to distract myself rather than sitting down and thinking, damn I'm so overwhelmed right now and what I really need is rest. What are healthy ways to feel rested?"
loseit,fekgg49,t3_epm7p0,1579199525.0,"Comparison is the thief of joy. Go to the gym because you want to for you. You only need to measure your progress against your past self, not anyone who is there. Whenever I go to the gym I feel some anxiety and I'm fairly fit so I can understand it's human nature. When I see people bigger than me working out do you know the only thing I think about them? Hell fucking yeah, look at this person who is working hard and putting in the effort to improve. There's only respect."
loseit,fekfmri,t3_epmn9z,1579199035.0,"The biggest help for me was probably addressing the underlying cause. I had untreated chronic PTSD with no support system. When I met my wife, she saw my hurt and helped me work on my PTSD. It took about 2 years and while I still have triggers, it's much better overall. When I'm having a bad day, I still we want fried chicken or a bean burrito but I'm vegan now so I either get a bean burrito no cheese and it's enough or I can eat two Boca ""chicken"" patties with hot sauce. One taco Bell bean burrito is 320 Cal and two chicken patties are 260. 

The other thing is that when I notice I'm starting to cope poorly (i.e. with food or alcohol) I do a self check in. I know that it's not a healthy way to cope and I have a list of healthy ways to cope instead so I make myself choose one of those. I know it might not feel better in the moment but it feels so much better overall."
loseit,fek0mnr,t1_fejzfdz,1579190063.0,"The biggest change for me was going vegan but I think it's just because it really made me more mindful of my eating and made it a lifestyle vs a diet. Now I love making colorful food that just seems so vibrant. I try to have at least 3 different colors per meal minimum and since the majority of my diet is WFPB it makes it easy not to count calories. 

But I definitely don't feel like I'm missing out either or restricting myself. In the past few days I've had sushi, tamales, empanadas, pizza, chilli with cornbread, a Cajun burger with avocado and homemade ranch dressing, dumpling soup, etc. The only thing that I didn't cook was the pizza."
loseit,fejzywk,t1_fejzkz0,1579189654.0,There's a ton! Just depends on what you want to do. 30 day fitness might be a good intro. Just search for fitness apps in the app store and see what peaks your interest.
loseit,fejzanf,t3_epktqy,1579189237.0,You could always follow a program online or through an app? That way you don't have to worry about creating a workout plan.
loseit,fejz6k1,t3_epkix0,1579189165.0,I went from calorie counting and yo-yo dieting like you to having a healthy relationship with food. I don't have to count calories at all now if I don't want to! I'll sometimes calorie count one meal to do a kinda random test on how much I might be consuming at an average meal but that's it.

loseit,fei3q1b,t3_ep9yup,1579129606.0,I can be an accountability partner if you want. I've never had a serious eating disorder but I went through years of dieting where I'd count calories and then binge if I went over. Now I have a really healthy relationship with food and don't count calories or binge!
loseit,fehv11c,t1_fehsxl8,1579124421.0,Nice! There's a fancy fundraising auction coming up in April that I'm trying to look good for. That extra motivation always helps doesn't it? Lol
loseit,fehsplo,t1_fehsgum,1579123113.0,Thanks! I'm a lot closer than I expected to be for such a short amount of time. I only have about 5-7 lbs more to go. I hope you reach your goals and enjoy the process along the way!
loseit,fehroot,t3_ep6d09,1579122534.0,"Maybe focus on diet first and then you can start adding in workouts when you have a bit more energy? I find that junk food and fast food make me super tired. If food is unpredictable, maybe meal prep and bring healthy snacks. You can keep a small cooler in your ambulance so you have healthy food on hand. Those changes should give you a bit of energy to start adding in working out slowly."
loseit,fehqq3g,t3_ep8aho,1579121983.0,"Yep, focusing on yourself is good! I'm down about 7.5 lbs since the first by incorporating new healthy habits rather than taking anything away (except booze for dry January). Feeling so much better mentally and physically."
loseit,fehoeik,t3_ep7z2g,1579120645.0,"It can be really difficult to eat and be healthy if your environment makes it difficult. Is your partner interested in doing this with you or at least supporting you? 

Think about your situation, how it makes you feel, what you need, and then make two requests. One request will be to yourself, are you willing to meet your needs? The other is to your partner, what specifically do you need from him to help you meet your needs?"
loseit,fehmrxq,t3_ep7i2i,1579119707.0,Maybe a nutritional shake instead of just a protein shake? I think it's fine for a snack or breakfast replacement but you also need real food. Vega One is a good option for a nutritional shake. Only 170 calories and very nutritionally dense.
loseit,fehmlek,t3_ep7lg0,1579119602.0,"That sounds really hard emotionally, I'm sorry you've been going through that. My suggestion would be to focus on mindfulness. Not only does it help with anxiety but it helps you be more in tune with your body and it's needs. There is an app developed by the VA and PTSD center which is really great that's called Mindfulness. It has a mix of information and practice. 

Mindful eating could be helpful to you. Slowing down and trying to taste all the different flavors equally. Noticing the smells of food. Noticing how it feels when you swallow and how your stomach starts to feel when it's getting full. Noticing when your body is hungry vs your brain telling you to eat or not eat. 

Continue with therapy if you can. It can be really powerful."

loseit,fehkjp5,t1_fehja7g,1579118419.0,"I'm all for eating healthy foods but I definitely think vegetables, beans, fruits, and some types of starches fall into that category.

Tracking calories and weighing daily can certainly be useful but it doesn't make it easier to eat less. It just reminds you of the consequences if you eat poorly. Finding things that make it easier to eat less is what makes weight loss easy."
