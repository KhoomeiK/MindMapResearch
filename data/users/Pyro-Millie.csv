Bonsai,feylcik,t1_fewm5y1,1579447128.0,"Here it is after some adjustments, and with a better background. I twisted the trunks and adjusted the guy wires to minimize the crossing while keeping the same silhouette, and I slightly adjusted where the ‚Äúfront‚Äù of the tree was to compensate for what I couldn‚Äôt fix. Did some trimming and branch bending too. I‚Äôve gotta say, the apex looks a lot stronger with that extra branch removed and one of the others bent differently!

Bonsai,feplbk0,t1_fepkk1s,1579323505.0,"Thanks. I‚Äôm going to start by cutting the branches down to 6-8‚Äù above the trunk. For now, that‚Äôs how tall I want it to be. As the branches get fuller and the trunk thickens, that might change with time, but for now I think roughly 9‚Äù total will look nice."
Bonsai,fepkjmh,t1_fepjuba,1579322903.0,"Omg. I found it! I know how I‚Äôm going to style the tree! I was messing with twisting the branches while viewing it from that angle, and I suddenly saw the tree this can be! Thank you!

One more question before I begin. Should I pull it out of the pot to set up a drain mesh and root wire system before I begin styling (without cutting the root ball)? Or would that count as re-potting and put too much strain on the tree for me to begin styling immediately? If I need to do this- as I worry about the stability of the tree if I don‚Äôt- how long should I wait before I begin pruning?"
Bonsai,fepk8q4,t1_fepjuba,1579322669.0,"Wow! That‚Äôs fascinating! I never would have thought of a forced perspective! By the way, here‚Äôs a picture of the tree from eye level, tipped slightly foreword.

Bonsai,fepfbqa,t1_fepef8f,1579319081.0,Yeah the branches are really wild XD! Step one was gonna be cut them way back from the get go. I just wanted to hear the bonsai chat‚Äôs opinions before I went and did it. I was ok with a thin trunk because that and the main branches are still flexible enough to move with wire and will thicken over time.
Bonsai,fepetq2,t1_feox4z4,1579318733.0,"Here‚Äôs the best spot I could find to be the front, as well as some movement I see and the main branches I can see for the tree. 


https://imgur.com/gallery/izzjm7H

My first step is going to be cut back the branches a lot. Then, I want to work with the two bottom branches I labeled. Maybe twist them so that they don‚Äôt lie in a 2D plane and provide some more motion?"
Bonsai,fepe4m9,t1_fepcgcd,1579318257.0,"Thanks for the advice. Of what the nursery had available, this one had the most decent trunk and roots I could find. I was not aware of the 6:1 guideline. Every one of these also had wild branches haha... 

First thing first, I‚Äôm definitely gonna cut it back quite a bit to help me better see the tree, and to give me some noice semi-hardwood cuttings to prop. This thing grows year round, and I definitely think it needs ramification. I‚Äôve got some potential ideas already from what I‚Äôve seen of the trunk. I‚Äôve found what I think I want to be the front of the tree, and I‚Äôm posting my images in the other commenter‚Äôs chain. Let me know what you think!"

Bonsai,fenykow,t3_eq5ukz,1579292650.0,"This is the tree I picked from SCBG‚Äôs nursery! Chosen because this species makes some nice bonsai, and this tree has a a well shaped and tapered trunk as well as a Nabari! Currently it‚Äôs branches are running wild, so it needs some pruning. Before I begin that process, I‚Äôd love some styling advice. I can potentially see a twin trunk informal upright."

Bonsai,fenxqk8,t1_fenjmov,1579292391.0,That‚Äôs the technique I was referring too but I forgot the name. I wasn‚Äôt going to pour bleach on my tree!!!
Bonsai,fenwtlo,t1_fenvgso,1579292066.0,"Most of the sets are 2-needles each, and the needles have a twist to them. Each needle is about 2‚Äù long. There are just a few 3-needle sets along the branches. The foliage is a yellow-green color on both the sapling and the adult plant. The adult trees I matched this with had the same needle structure and length, and I ID‚Äôd them as Shortleaf Pine. On the adult trees, this needle structure is distinctly smaller than that of other pine species. The adult trees had the squat acorn shaped cones still attached too. I saw some Lobollies nearby though. They had longer  needles in sets of three, and bigger, sometimes curled, cones. They are a slightly darker green too."
Machinists,fendpqb,t3_eq09nh,1579282482.0,What a cool technology! I hope this works to kill off your tumor. Thank you for sharing!
Bonsai,fenayp5,t3_eq2zpq,1579280800.0,"I‚Äôm doing exercises in seeing the mature bonsai tree in starting material and drawing it. This gives me a reference so I don‚Äôt lose sight of it, but is zoomed far enough out to allow flexibility in secondary/ tertiary branch structure depending on what the tree does over time (I‚Äôve drawn just the general pad shapes and needle direction). This also helps me in learning how to better draw trees for backgrounds in comics I may eventually write. I think incorporating Bonsai aesthetic ideals loosely into my background art (the way you see some shapes used in Bonsai in natural trees) will give it stylistic consistency and give each background something unique that sets it apart from other artists‚Äô work. 

This tree incorporates the existing deadwood-looking trunk that drew me to the sapling into the overall design. I want to keep the three branches the tree already has, and encourage them to grow into something between an informal upright and a windswept look, as if it‚Äôs grown on the edge of a cliff. I eventually want to include bark bleaching to highlight the trunk.

EDIT: Shari. That‚Äôs the technique I was referring to when I said ‚Äúbleaching‚Äù! No bleach will ever come near my plants! I am a bonsai noob but I know better than that!"

fountainpens,felkumq,t3_epl0mx,1579224595.0,"I think etching the casing with an acid and resist is a cool idea (Brass will etch using Ferric Chloride, and Sharpie can be used as a resist). Engraving it with a rotary tool is a good idea too! Whatever you do, practice your technique on a piece of scrap material first so that you can get the best result. I think you can buy Brass jewelry blanks to practice on depending on price.

Bonsai,fejos9g,t1_fej2dsu,1579181900.0,"I collected it because I really didn‚Äôt have access to nursery plants, and it looked like a size that could be coaxed into a bonsai with time. I also thought the trunk looked cool. It‚Äôs new growth coming out of what looks like old scarred wood. Also, the species is native to where I live and already has short-ish needles, so it‚Äôs a good candidate for further needle reduction. And it‚Äôs a competitive tree that thrives in full sun and dry soil- conditions I‚Äôm used to growing plants in because of my Lavender and Succulent collection. So basically- practice. As for timing, yes it‚Äôs January, but it‚Äôs practically early spring with the weather we have here. I checked, and this plant definitely has some buds. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre the right size or not, but they are there. If weather does turn cold again, then I do have means of protecting the roots. 

Thanks for the tips about the roots! This guy‚Äôs roots were spread every which way, (it didn‚Äôt have a true root ball, just a few big long roots- I think it might have been an offshoot of another pine) so When digging, unfortunately they did get exposed. But I saved the field soil to plant in. I have no idea if it‚Äôs going to work, but it‚Äôs the best I could do with how this tree was growing."

Bonsai,feiixfk,t1_feifi3s,1579139591.0,"No. The lava rocks are a wide variety of sizes and dispersed throughout to provide drainage, but there is also a good deal of pumice and regular soil (from where the tree was growing) mixed in. The pumice particles are 1/4‚Äù . The lava rocks are definitely bigger than I wanted, but they aren‚Äôt the only thing in there. It looks like a lot because I used a layer of them as top dressing, but just below the surface- where the roots are actually buried, there is a much better mix. To the right of the pot in this pic, you can see some of the pumice used."
Bonsai,feiadv3,t3_epb0pj,1579133879.0,"This is a Shortleaf Pine sapling I found growing in a side of the road forest. I made sure it was legal to transplant before I took it. I think I broke a couple of roots, but I managed to keep the majority of it‚Äôs root network intact. This little guy is planted in a mix of Lava Rock, Pumice, and some of the soil it was originally growing in (I heard the soil immediately surrounding pines has a fungus that supports them?). I did some very light pruning to remove dead and dying needles before taking photos. Unless somebody with more experience tells me otherwise, I will be using pruning methods suggested for Black Pine, as the information I could find suggested that this tree tends to have multiple flushes of growth like that one. If anyone has advice or experience with Shortleaf Pine, I‚Äôd love to hear it!"

fountainpens,fehs6om,t3_ep8he0,1579122817.0,"When I got this Lamy Al Star, it had some flow issues and was scratchy to use. The channel was too narrow, and likely slightly misaligned. It was not fun to write with because of that, which sucked because it‚Äôs a special edition I paid extra for to have as a vanity pen for my shimmer ink. It needs to write well. So I decided to take a risk, and ‚Äúfix‚Äù the nib by widening the channel. I carefully flexed it against the page to separate the tines and slightly widen the channel, and then I pressed it a few different ways to ensure alignment. I‚Äôm aware that if I had messed up, I would have ruined the nib. But I figured, Lamy nibs are interchangeable, and I‚Äôm starting with a broken nib. Either I‚Äôll end with a broken nib or be successful. I‚Äôm glad to report, I was successful! It now draws a smooth fine line and deposits consistent amounts of ink throughout the stroke!"

MLPdrawingschool,feftidp,t3_eouyxo,1579064730.0,"I‚Äôd say handle the two tasks separately at first. focus on getting used to your tablet by drawing simple sketches, random doodles, etc. if you‚Äôre used to traditional drawing, then use that as a tool to practice pony anatomy. Break down the characters into basic shapes and build their poses on top. After you‚Äôre comfortable using the tablet and know it‚Äôs capabilities, combine the two worlds and start drawing ponies on the tablet. With any new tool, practice is absolutely necessary, but that practice can be something as simple and fun as random doodles.

Clemson,feeql39,t3_eoh3k9,1579039115.0,"Clemson definitely had a lot of mistakes out there, and LSU played a great game. That‚Äôs why we lost. However, I will say those refs were notably bad at their job. And though I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why Clemson lost, it did make the game frustrating to watch and may have contributed to the number of injuries on the field. Bad refereeing makes people think they can get away with dangerous things in an already dangerous game and people get hurt.

MLPdrawingschool,fee7cxj,t1_fee49qg,1579027911.0,"Ahh. When you said springy I thought that you were referring to the flexible kind of nib.

MLPdrawingschool,fee0rdq,t1_fedxb50,1579023984.0,"Yeah, that takes a lot of practice. It‚Äôs rare for me to do single strokes even now, except when using dip pens (because they‚Äôre made for broader smooth line art). For where to put the variations, a good place to start in a cartoon style is making the outlines of shapes thicker than internal details: I.e. the outline of the body and the outline of the mane could be thickened while the internal detail lines are left thinner. Another thing that I like to do, and that I see a lot in anime, is to thicken the joints between lines. Here is a good example illustrating those concepts. You can see in this picture the outlines are thickened, and in the hair, the intersection of the ‚Äústrands‚Äù and the part has been thickened

homestuck,febgifk,t3_eo6hsp,1578958603.0,"Man fuck these people with the entire Planet Jupiter. If you quantify a piece of art or literature as good or bad based solely on the creators demographics, your opinion is automatically invalid. If they‚Äôre going to bitch about a webcomic from 2008 then why are they even on the HS twitter? And another thing. Who said it had to be ‚Äúunproblematic‚Äù by today‚Äôs standards? It‚Äôs a story entirely driven by dialogue between 13 year olds on the internet. Of course it‚Äôs going to be absolutely riddled with slurs, cursing, cards against humanity style jokes... because these characters are *young teens* on the *internet*. I want to see the people making these claims try to survive one hour on an Xbox Livechat. They‚Äôll see exactly what kind of language these kids use even today."

ExplainLikeImCalvin,fea481t,t3_eo7pkk,1578944196.0,"Natural Electricity can be harvested by shaking a stick at God during a thunderstorm, preferably with a capacitor (a mysterious artifact created by precisely layering conducting and insulating materials) attached to effectively bottle the charge for later use. The charge is created when God decides to strike you down with a series of lightening bolts because how dare you shake a stick at him? It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are genuinely angry. He created that stick, and that capacitor, and you. And you are all pathetic. 

If you don‚Äôt have the resources to collect and distill the pure Wrath of God, Store bought electricity is fine."

proplifting,fea1foo,t1_fe9mti5,1578943341.0,"Ahhh gotcha. Looking at that guide, the blooms on the parent plant match the thanksgiving cactus too. I had no idea there was an actual difference before now, just that this plant blooms around winter. As I said, although it is thanksgiving cactus, it had been blooming around Easter for awhile"
