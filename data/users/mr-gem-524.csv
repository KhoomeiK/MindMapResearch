RightwingLGBT,ffbl0al,t1_ffb85qi,1579770424.0,I [said it before](https://reddit.com/r/RightwingLGBT/comments/es5036/comment/ff7x1t7) and I'll say it again: it's sadly only a pipe dream & shower thought primarly for this reason.
RightwingLGBT,ff9ip33,t1_ff97e0t,1579713850.0,">  a pub than a club if this were to exist

Yes! I hate clubs, too. When I go out to eat, it's usually at the bar/brewery alone or maybe with coworkers (I thought the drinking w/ coworkers idea was a weird one at first, but it wasen't too bad)"
RightwingLGBT,ff88gm7,t3_es2ryb,1579669043.0,Anyone who pushes sexualization onto kids like this has a special spot in hell.
RightwingLGBT,ff80r8m,t1_ff7zof2,1579662990.0,"That, for sure, will never exist. And if it does, I have a reason to take a 2 1/2 hour-drive much more often.

Seriously though, geographically, P-town is kinda neat. Been there only a few times (went up the Pilgrim Monument every time). The gay culture there, though, is just like that of any other typical over-the-top liberal gay community: unappealing as fuck."
RightwingLGBT,ff803d5,t1_ff7zap5,1579662513.0,"> will happen at odd hours when there's nobody there to prevent it.

Yea, that's just one of the many issues with this pipe dream. At least no one would be there to be harmed. Gotta say, *Camp David's Secret* is my favorite name of the 3."
RightwingLGBT,ff7xjs0,t1_ff7twbe,1579660729.0,"> out into the country

Reading this again, I also just meant within the US."
college,ff7x6i2,t1_ff72vyf,1579660481.0,"Well damn, people are more pathetic than I thought."
RightwingLGBT,ff7x1t7,t1_ff7wfx5,1579660390.0,"> This business would appeal to a tiny tiny population and would fail

And that is why this is (sadly) only a shower thought."
RightwingLGBT,ff7vv0y,t1_ff7uq4o,1579659584.0,"I agree with every single one of your 5 points, dude. 

In fact, a few breweries I've been to even have board games available, and needless to say, you'd need dessert."
RightwingLGBT,ff7u3kv,t1_ff7twbe,1579658395.0,"> Isn't that some sort of oxymoron?

Legitimately going out into the country? It indeed is."
college,ff6r619,t1_ff31l6o,1579633159.0,"I mean, if you're in a shithole, yea. There's also a late-night caf near the dorms open until 11pm that's cheaper and better than McD's."
college,ff25n3j,t1_ff24l4e,1579494482.0,">People don't wanna walk at night

Good point, you can tell I have never lived on campus. Gotta say, though, our cafeteria near the dorms is open until 11pm I think, and it was pretty good and it still amazes me why it would be worth a high delivery fee for McDonalds (our caf food is better)"
college,ff21woy,t1_ff1wsel,1579491579.0,"Well shit, cause there's a shitton of fast food places walking distance school, including McD's & Subway."
college,ff1ujwg,t1_ff1ts9q,1579486508.0,"Do people actually get, let's say, McDonalds through it? It's kinda pricy just for a fast food meal. Where as a pizza it actually seems worth it to have it delivered to a dorm."
RightwingLGBT,fezi4yi,t1_fevz51n,1579457619.0,"Where do I begin, dude? Let's start with the fact that the overall LGBT community for years has been trying to push an in-your-face & ""I'm right and your wrong"" agenda (ex: forcing christian bakers to bake a gay wedding cake). Also the fact that sexual orentation shouldn't dictate your other political beliefs, and that in turn, sexuality is NOT an identity, it's part of what we are. I recommend looking around this sub because I know if I mention more it would be way too numbing to the other readers, never mind how numbing what I already wrote is to me.

Edit: oh shit, it's removed."
RightwingLGBT,fevu9ce,t1_fevnm5y,1579401579.0,"Simply put, he means ""real world"" as opposed to the bullshit world that the left tried to feed into our minds for decades."
unpopularopinion,fef4yyr,t3_eom2nd,1579048297.0,"You need to market yourself, though. Think of it like this: Asking a woman out is like applying for a job, but when she accepts, THEN it's like you're the employer. As the man, always pay for whatever you possibly can as that not only shows dependability, but makes her want you even more (aka, makes you more marketable)."
unpopularopinion,fe3trv7,t3_enoknf,1578852788.0,Never thought this was an unpopular opinion.
Vue,fe3et6i,t1_fe2rywh,1578848650.0,Good analogy. I haven't kept up with Vue in a while (other than hearing about a shutdown) and then this post popps up in my feed.
Vue,fe1vmtt,t3_enjbw5,1578831407.0,I thought Vue shut down......
rant,fddcscw,t3_ekq4lk,1578306055.0,"Unless you're Blare White or someone like her, **LGB people are the only legit ones, and they are NOT identies**, they are a part of what someone is. There are also only 2 genders."
unpopularopinion,fd739sj,t1_fd70vqh,1578198891.0,"I like routine though. I even get too thrown off by things like holidays - I do like them, don't get me wrong, but for the most part I'd be happier than a pig in shit if every day were pretty much the same."
OutOfTheLoop,fd6tdeq,t1_fd1n4wj,1578195465.0,Best explanation yet. Thank you.
OutOfTheLoop,fczesnu,t1_fczemyk,1578099598.0,Thought of that. But they could have done it last year for any year of the 20th century (like 1/3/19 as 1/3/1995).
RightwingLGBT,fc5yb7g,t3_eg3iri,1577468402.0,"22 also, & on a simelar boat. Never had a single date in my life. The women that I know are usually too snooty &/or creeped out by too much. The other guys I have been interested in though, with the exception of one, were straight. I really became close friends with one, and then we stopped talking (let's just say it was my fault & I learned my lesson the hard way, even when I thought I was close friends with this guy). Either way, though, I hope your visions get fulfilled 2020 :)"
