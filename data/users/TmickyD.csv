running,fdmqoi8,t3_em6k85,1578561038.0,"I was a pretty ""meh"" sprinter back in high school. I ran everything from the 400m to the 60m and even did pole vault and long jump. I wasn't great at any of them, but it was fun and kept me in shape. 

Unfortunately, in college I ended up spraining my ankle during my junior year. I ended up with a limp for 4 years due to getting it misdiagnosed. (The diagnosis at the time was ""not broken."") A podiatrist even told me I'd never run again.

After college I finally got it checked out by an orthopedic surgeon who told me it was fixable with surgery. I had the surgery, and was given the clear to slowly return to my old activities a year later. Sprinting didn't seem extremely practical after college, so I made the decision to switch to distance running. I've been having a blast simply jogging along for 20-30 minutes at a time. After 4 years of limping everywhere, bouncing on the balls of my feet feels amazing!

I haven't been extremely consistent with it (1-3 times a week), and I still have some muscle imbalances due to all the limping, but I have better endurance now than I ever did in high school, my 5k is under 30 minutes, and I'm only 7 pounds heavier than I was when I ran track. I'm not going to win any races any time soon, but I still consider it a huge success."

I was in the marching band in college, and we just finished our halftime performance at a football game. I got back to my seat and realized that I was going low. Fast.

I didn't have any glucose tabs on me due to the lack of pockets on my marching band uniform. I did have my credit card however, so I decided to grab myself some food from the concession stand. Unfortunately the line was stupidly long because it was halftime and everyone wanted snacks. By the time I walked the 100 yards to the concessions, I really felt like crap. That's when I saw the ambulance stationed at the end zone. Time for plan b.

I knocked on the door and was greeted by 2 EMTs who looked confused. (I don't blame them, who just knocks on an ambulance?) At this point I explained that I had diabetes, my blood sugar was low, and that line for food was reeeeeaaaaly long. They took me in and checked my blood sugar. 32. 

They immediately jumped into action. I was sat down and they started going through their supplies. Within about 45 seconds I was given a glucose/caffeine gel, a can of coke, and 2 slices of pizza. I think the coke and pizza was one of their lunches. I remember them asking if I was going to pass out and me replying that I've been below 20 and been fine.
