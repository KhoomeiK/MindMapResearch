fatlogic,fczotpb,t1_fcza37i,1578105908.0,">Of course I'm not more oppressed than some out there

I'm imagining a scene where this woman from the OP is alone in a room with her newly small fat friend chastising her about her less fat privilege when a fatter woman walks in, and the two women in the room abruptly stop talking and bow their heads in shame. This fatter woman is then berating the two smaller fats when an even fatter woman walks in at which point she also abruptly stops her harassment and bows her head in shame along with the other two. And this goes on and on and on and on."
UnresolvedMysteries,fcyyx8r,t1_fcyueu2,1578090162.0,"I do a lot of hunting. I've walked past and searched for deer longer than I care to admit that I knew for a fact to be down within a couple hundred yard radius. In the middle of the woods, with trees, downed logs, leaves, ravines, etc., it is far more difficult to find a 150+ 'body' than the average person realizes."

That, and you'd die from malnutrition. This person is hilarious. In one sentence they say that their body uses fat for nutrition and then in the next they say their body stores it, and never burns it. That doesn't add up to me."
fatlogic,fcw1kfx,t3_ej6o9x,1578015019.0,"Something tells me if they are so fragile that they can't be weighed at a doctor's visit, they don't have the balls to hand this to a trained medical professional. The risk of their fee fees being hurt by the doctor's inevitable response would be too much to ever actually go through with this."
howardstern,fcsr1my,t1_fcsmzvw,1577922937.0,If you're not fully versed in Pete Weber (Oakley douche pictured here) you need to familiarize yourself with him. It was like watching a bowling parody but in real life.
