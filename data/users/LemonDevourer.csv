JUSTNOMIL,ffkamx7,t1_ffjxhni,1580019669.0,"I hadn’t even thought about this being a potential CPS case. What do I even do if they get involved? I’ve heard such conflicting stuff about ”socialtjänsten” (our version of CPS) Some say to be as honest and cooperative as possible, while others claim you need to be very selective with what you say."
JUSTNOMIL,ffjl5ls,t1_ffjk1lj,1580000752.0,"Kärringjävel is the perfect way to describe her right now!

JUSTNOMIL,ffjj6eb,t1_ffjh5vd,1579999418.0,I suspect this is ”revenge” on her part after a conflict we had over her almost stealing my grandmas bowl. (which I even made an AITA post about)

Thank you, 40-something coworker, that wasn’t creepy or unsolicited at all. Not the first time someone comments on what I wear, but for some reason it never happened when I was fat."

AmItheAsshole,fcps2kn,t1_fcpi6mw,1577870922.0,You seem strangely invested in this given that you have responded to almost all comments in this thread. There is a *very* low chance she was confused as she is A) very clear and healthy in her mind B) I told her I had the same design and C) I *told* her it was my bowl. Why did she not believe me? Why would she assume I was lying? Why did she even go through my cabinet in the first place? Some other comments here have suggested that MIL may have stolen other pieces before and I am beginning to suspect that may be true. It's a big set and I am not sure I would notice a few pieces disappearing.

Like she took the liberty to do our laundry while we were out of the house, but she mixed everything together (coloured, white, delicates, w/e) so it ended up ruining a white blouse of mine, and she never apologized for it.
