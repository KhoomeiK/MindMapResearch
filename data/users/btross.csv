That's a specious assumption when American families are being burned alive on the road in Mexico.  I haven't moved the goalposts.

>These caravans are made up of people who felt compelled to leave their homes and families for a number of reasons. Students, bakers, bus drivers, small-business owners, newspaper sellers, waitresses, parents with small babies – these are the people fleeing to find a safer place to live.  
>  
>Many make the heart-breaking decision to leave instead of living in desperate fear of being the next victim of violence. Honduras, for example, has one of the highest murder rates in Latin America, and the world. Its murder rate is 800 percent higher than that of the United States.  
>  
>Other people leave after facing death threats for refusing to pay extortion to violent criminal networks known as *maras* that control territory and resources in countries such as El Salvador and Honduras. It is particularly difficult to escape the grip of *maras* in these small countries, which are each roughly the size of the states of New Jersey and of Arizona, respectively.
