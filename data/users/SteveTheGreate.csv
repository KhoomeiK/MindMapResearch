Let’s say you’re in the middle of the Sahara and you find a tree, it’s the only tree in a 100km area. You then see a leaf under the tree, it’s safe to assume that the leaf belongs to the tree event though you didn’t witness it.

Granted, it’s not 100% guaranteed ye leaf belongs to that tree but then again even if you see something doesn’t mean it’s 100% real (hallucinations, drugs, etc...)"

# I need some help with my workout plan.

&#x200B;

Due to age and distance from the nearest gym, I can't really go to the gym, that's why for the past 7-8 months I've been training at my house with body-weight exercises and some free weights.

I think this is a good time to mention I'm by every definition of the word a hard-gainer, I'm 15 years old and before I started working out I weighed 45kg (100lbs). I train about 3 to 4 times a week, I do 500 pushups every workout day, about 100 squats and some arm exercises and obviously have been using progressive overload.

I have also been eating a very well balanced diet, with a lot of calories because I desperately needed to get some weight.

After more than half a year of training I've seen very little muscle improvement, and I look basically the same as I did back then, I checked the pictures I took before starting to work-out and I can't see any real difference.

I think the issue is my workout plan, that's why I want to change it. I can't go to the gym but I'm willing to try anything else. If anyone has some advice it would be greatly appreciated, thanks"
