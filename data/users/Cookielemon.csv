AirBnB,ff52su8,t1_ff46dq1,1579578676.0,"In my county there is more incentive for the local government to restrict short term rental. People in the community generally hate them and those who are in opposition of the ordinance do not speak up or are generally unaware of what's going on until they have to pay an extra 100$ a year for a ""license"". Even with the regulation people are still wanting stricter rules and are calling for it at every public meeting. I would say generally the squeaky wheel gets the grease in most cases. So I think in our case If people did come out and speak in favor of STR  or even said they didn't mind a lot less restrictions would be placed."
TwoXChromosomes,fen692x,t1_feltb94,1579277889.0,I think he is jealous because I will ask whoever is around to help me lift heavish boxes off of high shelves and I never ask him bc he makes a big deal out of everything. I am afraid to say anything to the guy bc he gets all huffy and puffy about the stupidest shit.  He is one of those people that will go off in a regular conversation without warning. I might have to go to my boss about it because he has honestly been getting worse and treating everyone in the office like shit. It's beginning to be a hostile environment.
TwoXChromosomes,fen5rl1,t1_fel9oy6,1579277586.0,"Dude, they will come and ask me to do the easiest shit like change the copy paper or restart the printer then stand there while I do it. They could have just done it themselves....."
TwoXChromosomes,fen5hb4,t1_fel1582,1579277405.0,He was rude about it. Like he was offended that I was doing it and then annoyed that he had to do it. It was really weird.

Marriage,fdc56ki,t3_ejuzmp,1578267321.0,I love this. This was my biggest fear in getting married. I love my husband so much. We have never argued  before. I was so afraid that for some reason a giant relationship testing argument was a right of passage for a married couple.
LongDistance,fdc14sf,t3_ekc6kr,1578265077.0,"I just married the love of my life, but the catch is: I knew him about a year before we got together. The reason why is because I ""didn't do long distance."" 

He moved hundreds of miles away the day we planned to hang out first. He needed a job and it required traveling. 

During that year, I dated someone who was ""here and wanted to stay close to me."" He was abusive and shitty. He changed me as a person and it changed how I treat people and live my life to this day. 

When I finally reconnected with my now husband, he still lived a good distance from me, but actually really close to my home town. So we went out and talked every day. We were basically long distance. He added such a quality to my life I could not believe I didn't have faith in our relationship during that first move. He quit his job and moved in about 3 months after we got connected again. We couldn't stand to be apart. 

Things will come together. If he adds quality to your life even being far, you are doing the right thing. Things that seem hard are sometimes worth it in the long run. I tried to take the easy way first and got burned for it. You are strong. You can be there for him and him you without being with him physically. A loving relationship is so much more than physical closeness. Work on those things and it will be better when you do close the gap. 

Sending love to you."

AirBnB,fdayhll,t1_fda9vw5,1578251800.0,"Also maybe a mini fridge you only plug in when the guests come in. Those things eat power, but it might be something worth looking into if you don't want to clean the fridge..they might try to look into the host's  fridge, but I cant see them taking anything. I would not eat some random peron's food unless it was maybe a condiment or drink their beer.

I once stayed in an Airbnb that had a  full bar and just asked that you pay them whatever you think you should.  
Someone could do the same with beer and snacks in the fridge."
Dogtraining,fdawm1l,t1_fd9c5rk,1578251214.0,I didn't think about that. She seems to want to get far away from me when we go out. She hasn't gone in the house today. I closed all doors to the carpeted rooms and I have been sitting in the main room with her all day. I put her on the runner briefly and left her alone so she could have privacy. I have no way of knowing if she went or not. I tried the pads beside the door but she just started playing with them.. smh.
AirBnB,fda4k2b,t3_eke4ci,1578241557.0,"I would never touch someone else's stuff. I went to an Airbnb that had really cool marvel decorations every where and I'm glad they left it up. Maybe find a way to place your son's metals (or similar things) in better looking way. Like put out the most recent ones in a shadow box and put the old ones away. That way you won't have to move them all. 

 I would still put away anything you don't want broken, but if I looked under the sink I wouldn't be upset if there were some half used tooth paste and hair brushes. As long and you provide mini tooth paste or complimentary things for your guests, I don't think they would touch the things you are using.

I would just try to purge some things in general. Cleaning it every time would be awful. Don't have things out that you couldn't stand to lose. Keep your valuables and family heirlooms up and safe until you are no longer renting your home. Maybe you could put a shed in your yard that is padlocked or close off a room in the house with a deadbolt where you keep everything you love. 

I don't rent, but I stay in a lot of Airbnbs.  I am also a neat freak and practice minimalism in my home. 
 I am just throwing out suggestions."
depression,fd9nub7,t3_ek3uky,1578235836.0,"Bro. The same shit happened to me. My friend is the one who told me about it, not my ex. I actually found out he had been sleeping with multiple women behind my back through that experience. 

It's good that you found out and someone like that doesn't need to be around you in your state.i know it doesn't help, but you will be glad they are gone in time. Just focus on yourself and improving your own quality of life. Those people are not adding quality to your life. I tried to kill myself a second time over the same POS that cheated on me. It is embarrassing to say that I let him get his claws into me so deeply. 

Don't throw your life away bc of those worthless people. If you want to give up, it is for you. Don't give them the satisfaction of knowing they hurt you or the attention they know they will get if you do kill yourself. Im not condoning your want for suicide, I just know that when you get it in your head it's a hard thing to shake. But no matter what you do, Cut them out of your life and make sure everyone knows why."

It makes me feel like I have no friends or no one that is trying to actively help me through it. 
I know they probably talk to their friends, but I just don't really have any, and the ones I try to talk to probably think I'm weird for telling them all this off the wall shit."
AirBnB,fcl718f,t1_fckn7m4,1577741190.0,"Edit: autocorrect

Dude I said to them"" I assumed you washed the sheets"" they flipped out and said they do. Then were bitching me out at 3:30 that they would not be able to get the dog hair out before the next guest comes at 4. I checked out at 10 am... An hour early. So how is it my problem you waited until last minute to clean?"
AirBnB,fcklx9e,t1_fcisxyj,1577728191.0,"Same thing happened to me. The host allowed pets, but made me vacuum up all the hair. They asked me to leave the sheets on the bed, but then claimed I was supposed to vacuum the sheets as well. They were trying to make me pay for the sheets because they claimed that they were permanently damaged due to dog hair.

Other than dog hair and some mascara on the duvet cover the house was in perfect condition, but they still sent me a ton of pics, read through my old reviews and preached about how I was an awful guest, and gave me an awful review that Airbnb took down bc there was no evidence supporting their claims. 

I have never had to deal with a host like that."
Marriage,fck4iz1,t3_eh9a8o,1577716366.0,"Dude. I have had this EXACT same argument with my husband. What you said to him is almost literally word for word what I said. Especially the part about apologizing about how clean I need  things need to be.

I just let him know that I need things to be a certain level of clean, and it will effect my mental health if I have to live in a cluttered and dust ridden house. I told him I felt like I was a maid for everyone while he got to do things he enjoyed. 

He did pout a bit, but in the long run he has truly made an effort. 

I have also made an effort to not be so anal. I understand being tired. 
I stopped flipping out that there was a couple dishes in the sink at bed time. I stopped getting mad that the laundry wasn't folded immediately after it came out of the dryer. 
I started ordering my groceries a head of time so he can just go pick them up. 
I got a little bit more relaxed with things being left around the house as long as they are put back in a day or two. 

Also my husband and brother know they have to clean before they have anyone over or before we go on a trip. 
It is difficult to live with other people. It sucks when you get home and things aren't the way you left them that morning. 

I don't want to do the dishes sometimes so I make my husband eat take out. 
I get tired of cooking so my brother has to eat pizza rolls. 
I had to step back and realize I don't have to micromanage every small thing. Like what my husband's drawers look like and how he arranges his clothes. 
I can't be in charge of what everyone eats on a daily basis and still do things I enjoy. 

A lot of the time if I feel like my husband isn't helping. I will literally just leave and go to the gym. When he asks why I tell him he gets to do what he enjoys (video games) so I'm going to do something I enjoy as well.

DO NOT slave and clean while he is sitting on his ass having fun. Go do something fun and he will quickly realize how much work it is to run the house."

AskReddit,fc37kbp,t3_eft9mt,1577383369.0,"He moved away before we met in person and I ghosted him. I started seeing someone else who ended up being insane. Now I have been through a traumatic abusive relationship that has changed my entire outlook on life and how I treat others. 

After I finally put my foot down and left the guy, I spent some time single and ended up reconnecting with old tinder guy. 

We are happily married now, but I am still suspicious of him because of the last relationship. 
I used to blame him for leaving, but now I know if I hadn't been so impulsive and attention seeking, we could have been together before and I wouldn't have to pay so much for therapy."
raisedbynarcissists,fc36rzz,t1_fc33dd7,1577382823.0,"She said the suicide lie has completely changed the dynamic between her and her mom. I think it was catastrophic. It has had an awful effect on her life, but she said that it's not really her mom, but the rest of her family that she is not ready to walk away from. 

Her mom is so controlling. Anyone who talks to people she doesn't like will be subject to her wrath. If my SIL stops talking to her she will lose her dad and brothers as well."
raisedbynarcissists,fc363g2,t1_fc355zw,1577382357.0,I'm pretty sure they just said that to guilt trip her into thinking it was some sort of urgent matter. The sad thing is if the had just told her they wanted some for themselves she still would have helped them.

raisedbynarcissists,fc3516b,t1_fc32ysa,1577381597.0,"The only downside to visiting California was shitty assholes assuming I was hillbilly and ghetto bc of my southern accent. A bunch of rude people there

JUSTNOFAMILY,fc2vat1,t3_efsg5g,1577375003.0,"Honestly I am really sorry this is happening to you. 
Maybe your husband doesn't realize what is going on and is completely oblivious. I know I sometimes have a problem knowing if people are flirting with me because I am super insecure myself. If that is the case you should have nothing to worry about because she isn't on his radar at all. 

If he is flirting back with her that is a whole different animal. 

Either way you should talk to him and find out what you believe his intentions are and what he believes her intentions are towards you. 

If you tell him how you feel and he is respectful and supportive he might do something like talk to his brother about it or grey rock her. 

It is quite possible he has no idea that you are being treated like that by here because she acts like a completely different person to him.

Until you talk to him and he takes action, I suggest you just not be overly nice to her and try to stay away from her as much as possible. Stay near your husband at family things so she knows you aren't fucking around. Also maybe if she is talking to him you could try to interject/insert yourself into any conversation they are having in order to force her to interact with you in front of him."
dryalcoholics,fbxdero,t1_fbt9k96,1577181454.0,"It was my BIL his wife and my SIL. No parents. She instigated the fight bc she was being a drunk asshole. I didn't say anything that I didn't mean to her bc she was the one who was being a dick. 

I do wish I had not left the concert early to go get drunk alone. It really hurt my husband's feelings and I let my emotions get the best of me. I probably would not have gotten so upset and irrational if I wasn't very drunk."
