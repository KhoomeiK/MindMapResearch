offmychest,fefgjwb,t1_fef0puw,1579055862.0,Wow. You're a straight up fucking internet troll aren't you? Fuck off with your fear mongering. Moron.
offmychest,fdt16ue,t3_en10of,1578710583.0,"Read him the book about the boy who cried wolf. Then do a ""bourne identity"" book-in-your-throat punch. Laugh as he writhes on the ground. Or, if you don't have the stomach for that, tell him he's a jackass and to eat a bag of dicks."
offmychest,fdk593u,t1_fdjq8vg,1578496359.0,"It's always the older generation that are less understanding. Anyway, I hope it lasts and you enjoy it to it's fullest. Best of luck."
gynecomastia,fdjqbew,t3_elklbu,1578483330.0,What are you ashamed /scared of exactly?
offmychest,fdjpvns,t3_elo4wn,1578482765.0,"I'm happy for you, it is a wonderful, exhilarating feeling to be wanted by someone. Any chance you can share where you are from? I am an Iranian living overseas, but back home it was very similar in that people had to be very sneaky/private with their affection when getting to know each other. It's sad and frustrating to see or hear about."
offmychest,fddhsc9,t3_ekrnqo,1578312836.0,"Speak, man! You're an adult, communicate, and drop this childish act. Did you expect her to brag to her crushed friend about how awesome you are, rubbing it in her face? Talk about emotional intelligence. You have someone who loves you, wants to have sex with you, and your upset because she said to her upset friend your nice, sweet, caring but not exciting? Jesus Christ. Then do some exciting stuff. Problem solved. Better yet, communicate and ask her about it. Or go back to elementary school and go back to pulling a girls' pig tails."
offmychest,fddgxz2,t3_ekmj7s,1578311805.0,You're an inspiration to your children and to do many others.
offmychest,fdc0t49,t3_eki8ru,1578264912.0,Champagne for everybody! Get this person a medal! Wooooooooo!
offmychest,fczclvu,t3_ejnaon,1578098224.0,"There is no point, man! Life doesn't have a point, a goal, a finish line. The sooner you accept that and just do what makes you happy, the happier you will be. It's that simple. You live one life, what are you trying to prove? To who? Why? Jist live your life. Be happy."
offmychest,fczc8we,t3_ejofkz,1578098012.0,"Trust your instinct! Take it from someone who didn't, was married for 12 miserable yrs and is now getting divorced. Run, buddy, run!"
offmychest,fcz2376,t1_fcyxzc7,1578092113.0,Here here! Fuck him up in the non-fun way.
offmychest,fcyyf5r,t1_fcyvdli,1578089840.0,"If you knew anything about what my people suffer under this regime you would understand. People massacred in the streets for protesting fuel hikes. Basic necessities are unaffordable. The government refuses to pay any of their employees or private contractors and throws them in jail for months where they either starve or are killed. You have no clue, living your sheltered life, what my 88 yr old grandmother has to do to survive with no power, barely any food and constant water ""outages"". How many of my cousins are forced into what is basically indentured labour because they can't fight back or risk the safety of their families. Spare me your keyboard heroism."
offmychest,fcyhl48,t3_ej8ose,1578080284.0,Jesus Christ. What is this salty discharge coming out of my eyes? Am I leaking? That was beautiful.
offmychest,fcygz7w,t3_ejk0y9,1578079954.0,"Dear parents of Tatum,

When you love a child so much and have them taken away, it shatters you. To hear that you can overcome your grief and turn around and show love to a perfect stranger and her two kids tells me that your love is still strong and pure regardless of the trauma you have endured. While I can't offer much but words, know that your kindness transcends boundaries, and up here in the cold bitter north of Canada I wish you happiness and hope for the best outcome for you. Watch over each other just as your angel watches over you. Much love."
offmychest,fcy0cge,t3_ejgdgi,1578072922.0,"Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up. Learn from your mistakes and step up, cock your fist back, and punch life in the teeth. Say ""Fuck you life, get outta my way. I got shit to do"" . Focus on yourself, and be with your family. Life will go on."
offmychest,fcxzjug,t3_ejdo7o,1578072646.0,You need to dump that emotional vampire and move on. A friend is someone who empathizes and cares. She does neither. She is not a friend to you.
offmychest,fcxywar,t3_ej74xn,1578072437.0,"Spend your time helping people. If it doesn't matter to you, it sure as fuck will matter to them. Who knows, you might enjoy it."
offmychest,fcxylg5,t3_ejeg8h,1578072300.0,"It is bullshit. Welcome to the human race. I would opt out, but my robot body isn't ready yet. I just need a few more toasters, a blow dryer and maybe a vacuum hose."
offmychest,fcxxhjh,t3_eje8ii,1578071845.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. It's a difficult thing to comprehend. I hope you have family or friends to be with to help you through it. If not, therapy will help. Good luck."
offmychest,fcxx2x6,t3_ejhixj,1578071746.0,"Iranian here. The killing was justified. He deserves to die. I hope this is the start of something, but i fear for the poor souls that Iran conscripts into the army at age 18 just because they are too poor to buy out and not join. A war will mean the death of so many innocent children who were forced to join the army. I hope cooler heads prevail. Or at the very least, a surgical strike that will kill Khamenei and all his motherfucking henchmen."
offmychest,fcxwev5,t1_fcxig1d,1578071410.0,Likewise. Stay safe Fati-jan.
offmychest,fcxfmsm,t3_ejd65g,1578061677.0,"Iranian here in Canada. My entire extended family lives in Iran. And the fucking Iranian government is going to try and do something even more stupid to prove how awesome they are, and Iranian citizens will pay the price. I fear war will lead to another destroyed country just like Iraq. I understand your fear, but if war happens, I suggest getting as far away from government installations, bases and communications should war break out."
Tinder,fcx9tnr,t3_ejbtf2,1578056735.0,Omg. This is priceless. I want to see this line in a movie.
offmychest,fcx9eqs,t1_fcx5ysh,1578056332.0,"I guess the divorce would be hard for the kids, to them it would seem so final. My son has said things that make me believe that he is hopeful that this will pass and i try to temper that that divorce is just the official word and paper that comes but the scenario will be the same. Unfortunately our friends were in the dark about our marital strife and I had not revealed that i had OCD. In the end, once my wife wanted separation she literally told everyone we knew that we were separating and that I had OCD within a span of hours of us coming to that decision. That seems to have changed people's opinion of me, and i feel like I am avoided or even shunned as if I was somehow a terrible person for having OCD. People's perception of mental health problems is not often open minded. I'm sure there is a fair bit of eye rolling and ""oh gimme a break, just get ahold of yourself"". Like it's a choice or a way of life, not an affliction. I have to rely on my own friends that are not mutual to get me through it, but unfortunately that's a very limited pool of people."
offmychest,fcx8v6k,t1_fcwq4t8,1578055791.0,"It does suck. And it's a terrible journey unfortunately, not a flick of a switch which many people end up hoping for. Keep being you. You are an anchor right now for many people, your husband included. When they lean on you the burden is heavy, sometimes unbearably so. But your resilience and strength will see you through it. In situations like this hope is what we grasp at, but it can sometimes be a dangerous thing. I don't say lose hope, but rather hope cautiously and be realistic. Our strength comes through when hope fails, not when hope surges."
offmychest,fcx8k5j,t1_fcws1r5,1578055475.0,"It's not about things just working out, that's nonsense. It's about focusing on yourself to make you happy. When you are happy with yourself, your entire demeanor changes. How you carry yourself, how you interact with others and especially how others perceive you. If you are happy with your self physically and emotionally that confidence and contentment resonates with others. It attracts them. People want anchors as partners. Solid, stable and reliable because they exude that confidence that tells them ""I got you""."
offmychest,fcwaehp,t3_ej3vst,1578020840.0,"My best friend is a short, round lesbian with a crew cut. I'm a guy that's 6'3"", built like Hugh Jackman (except for the hair, mine is shorter). If my friend wasn't gay I'd marry her. It's all in how you carry yourself and your personality. You can't be jaded and cynical with low self esteem and think that's NOT a problem. Work on yourself first. When you are happy with who you are, you will be irresistible to the right person, mark my words."
offmychest,fcw9m4o,t3_ej21rt,1578020312.0,"Aw buddy, that sucks. I'm sorry you went through that. It's hard to jump back into things after an experience like that, it's a blow to the self esteem. Focus on yourself, happiness comes from within you, not from someone else. When you are happy with your self you will be irresistible to the right person, mark my words."
offmychest,fcw8ysz,t3_ej7c41,1578019883.0,People are morons. Being a dick/cunt to someone because of their hair is no different than treating them badly because of their skin complexion. Pigment is pigment. It's fucking 2020 and we're still dealing with this shit. My first girlfriend was ginger and I worshipped the ground walked upon.
offmychest,fcw80am,t3_ej15at,1578019249.0,People fart. It's impossible not to. How can he judge you when you have his pee-stick on your mouth? It was the price of admission for the ride..... Let's hope he doesn't get pink eye lol.
offmychest,fcw7psi,t3_ej7scb,1578019059.0,"Confused, he's a good man but he hurt you? Can't be both. Kids are incredibly resilient and will adapt faster than yoy know. My wife left me two months ago and we have two young children, 8 and 5. I thought it would be hard because you come to rely on someone in so many ways, but you really don't know what you are capable of until you just have to do it. Letting someone hurt you over and over again will only make you feel worse. He may be in some weird comfort loop of treating you like shit and getting away with it. Live your life, yoy can't do that being someone else's punching bag."
offmychest,fcw77dz,t3_ej4t37,1578018727.0,"Sounds like Nate was a total douche. Being drunk is not an excuse to grope or force yourself onto someone. I'm sorry you went through that, it's totally unacceptable. Next time, a forceful ""fuck off"" or a swift kick/knee in the groin will get your meaning across. Also, I apologize on behalf of men, we are truly not all walking hard-ons."
offmychest,fcw6fod,t3_ej1l6y,1578018229.0,"Decisions in your life that are meaningful are rarely ever easy. But in the end, it's your life, so live it before you are old and filled with regret."
offmychest,fcw635q,t3_ej8cw1,1578018002.0,Nope. People suck. Live your life.
offmychest,fcw6131,t3_ej7h3z,1578017965.0,"My friend, it sounds like you are grieving. I too went through the same thing when my father died, it's like the world around me lost color and nothing felt like it was worth while. It pains me to read your words, but know this: although we do not know each other and will likely never meet, I will listen and I will care. You are not alone."
offmychest,fcw5ksg,t3_ej824l,1578017673.0,"That's what love is, whether for a dog or a person. I'm sorry you hurt, but I promise you, it will feel different with time. It will not pass, but rather change you, because love is eternal and will be with you for the rest of your life. You will give that love to another friend, dog or human, and it will grow stronger just as you do."
offmychest,fcw59n7,t3_ej349e,1578017465.0,"You are human. You're just interacting with shitty humans. You're a fucking superhero, you just need to show it. Others think less of you? Show them you think less of them for their fucking ignorance. Prove them wrong."
offmychest,fcw4z7k,t3_ej86e4,1578017270.0,"You are more than the body that houses you. Love yourself for who you are, not for the biological possibility your body has. You do not have to have kids, just like how a man with a penis does not have to have kids."
offmychest,fcw4eor,t3_ej7dt8,1578016893.0,"That's rough man, sorry you and your mom are going through this. Wishing someone's suffering ends is very normal. I'm sure your cousins feel the same way. Just comfort them the best you can, the end is inevitable."
offmychest,fcw41x4,t3_ej62lt,1578016662.0,"I'm sure there is more than one poster, so relax. From someone who grew up with two stupidly superstitious parents from an asian culture , take it from me, speak your mind, let it be known where you stand. Think for yourself (clearly you do already, which is great) . You may be underage living with her now , but that will not always be the case. Nut the relationship you will have and the control her superstitions will have over you when you are older are up to you. Stay strong my friend."
offmychest,fcw3lv1,t1_fcvqtg3,1578016365.0,"This is solid advice. The fear you face OP is in the fact that you are afraid it might happen again and you can't do anything or are powerless. Become the embodiment of power. Fight for yourself and your future. No one else can solve this but you. There is no magic answer thay can fix you, no phrase that can take your fear away. Just you, your confidence and your skill. I speak from experience, same thing happened to me when I was 12. I am now 37, and by fuck, I kick some serious ass. 3rd degree black belt in Taekwondo. Changed my life. You can do this. Fear is the mind killer. Kill it back."
offmychest,fcw2wn7,t3_ej6ekb,1578015898.0,"The proverbial rock bottom is where the lesson sinks in, my friend. Reflect on what you did to get you there, be honest with yourself first before being honest with your family. What, if anything, are you going to do about it? How will you move forward? How does this effect your goals? These are all the things you fear facing through your family, which is why you dread telling them. They may be angry or furious or whatever, ultimately this is still your life, your future. They will be angry or upset at you AND MAINLY for you. If at all. I suggest you write a letter saying what you want to say. Read it, write it again. Be honest. Brutally so with yourself. It will help you gather your thoughts. It may even be how you chose to communicate with your parents. People make mistakes, even smart ones. I leave you with this quote "" Two wrongs don't make a right. But if you've done wrong and you know all along that it's just one life, at what point does one fight for what's right?"""
offmychest,fcw1rp8,t3_ej6u6e,1578015151.0,"Wow. This is a hard situation. But your strength and resilience is amazing. You have bent over backwards to help people in need, lost in the grief paralysis that comes with being bystanders to cancer. This is a phase, not a forever situation, although it may feel like it. You will have your baby again (props to your awesome parents btw), and whatever happens, your husband will move on with his life regardless of the outcome. I know how badly you want things to go back to normal, and how sometimes you wish people could stand on their own two feet. But what you and maybe even they don't realize is the strength it takes to come together and support each other in this time, and the sacrifice you are making to make this happen and to support your husband and your extended family . You should look in the mirror and be incredibly proud of yourself. You are a superhero without a cape. This too, shall pass."
Gunpla,evoqiin,t3_ckdi18,1564654307.0,Very nicely done. What do the decals say?
