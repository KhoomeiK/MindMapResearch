quityourbullshit,fcj4afp,t1_fci11xz,1577676916.0,"Why is it a problem if everyone, the poor and the rich, are all getting richer? The only reason they are getting richer faster is due to previous investments. 

The rich are not making money off of the working class. The entrepreneurs and workers create a mutual relationship where the entrepreneurs take most of the risk to have the chance of making more money and the worker gets a stable, lower income. If the worker isn’t satisfied with their pay, they can always turn to a competitor who will treat them better. Like I said before, the poor are getting richer. The people who deserve money are the people who either worked for it or put other money on the line for it. About inheritance, only 14% of the wealth the rich have is inherited. The lower and middle classes actually inherit more of their wealth than the rich do.

My point with Bill Gates was that he doesn’t just have 110 billion dollars siting in a safe. Why is it immoral to have a lot of money? If the way they earned their money is legal, then I don’t see a problem. Bill Gates could have kept all of the money for himself but he decided to donate ludicrous amounts of money.

And the reason why technology could advance is because companies invested resources to make the things I mentioned better and cheaper. Without the incentive of profit, these innovations would never have been made. If you are unable to afford anything I mentioned, you are either homeless or on the verge of homelessness. 

If you are able to learn a trade that is useful, if you are willing to go from the bottom of the totem pole and work your way up, if you are willing to really get your hands dirty, you can get a decent job.

My problem with free healthcare is that a lot of the problems with US healthcare is the government involvement. The government has heavily reduced competition which caused less incentive for insurance and pharmaceutical companies to lower prices. The US forces doctors to go through expensive licensing procedures and forced experienced migrant doctors to do the same. We limited the amount of doctor trained per year to 110,000 per year and low supply of doctors causes higher prices. I personally don’t see government healthcare working for us.

The idea that republicans own media is one of the funniest things I’ve heard today. In fact media and entertainment almost exclusively leans left. If anyone caused Bernie to be ignored, it’s people like Hillary. She effectively took over the DNC which screwed Bernie before the primaries could even begin. I don’t agree with his politics. He was a big advocate for us to mimic the Venezuelan economy before it went down the shitter. He then claimed to be advocating for the Nordic model despite it not being socialist. I would trust his opinions a bit more if he put his money where his mouth is and sold his multiple houses, took his millions of dollars, and donated the extra money to the US treasury."

quityourbullshit,fchwo5h,t1_fchmgeg,1577655019.0,"Inequality of wealth has always existed. There has never been an economic system on a large scale that has created almost no economic inequality. The fact that the wealth gap is growing doesn’t mean that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The reality is that we all are getting richer. The rich are just getting richer faster. I am not saying that all rich people are great people. Some of them are pretty bad, but that doesn’t mean all rich people don’t deserve to be rich because they have more money.

You assume that all of Bill Gates’ net wealth is liquid. 16 billion dollars are in shares for Microsoft alone. Bill Gates still donates a lot to charities. He has sold about $35.8 billion dollars worth of stocks to fund the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The reason why I defend a capitalist system is because it has benefited everyone. Today, poor people are able to own TVs, cars, phones, refrigerators, microwaves, decent food, and other luxuries that were once only owned by the rich. It allows someone who grew up in a poverty to get a decent job and support themselves. Is this a perfect system, no. There will always be people who aren’t able to live comfortably, but I have yet to find a functioning system that can solve this problem."
quityourbullshit,fchjfdh,t1_fcgitph,1577651036.0,"How are billionaires responsible for people being poor? There are children starving but you wouldn’t say that you are evil for having a lot of food. It may surprise you to know that rich people want poverty to end as well. Ignoring the moral reasons, if poor people had more money, they can spend more money. Could you imagine how much money Bill Gates could make if even half of homeless people could buy his products.
