So, when you discuss competitive advantage including raw resources in the case of Québec, I have to refer you to the point I made about the Dutch disease 2 posts ago.

But even assuming I had it all wrong, raw resources in Québec aren't going to be enough to fuel economic growth on the long term in an economy that's half the size of Saudi Arabia's. Just have a look at the size of Québec's economy that the sectors you mention are taking ([source](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610040001&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.5)):

* Raw resources: 1.51%
* Tourism: 2.07% ([source for tourism](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=2410004201), dated 2014)
* Finance: 5.87%

Even if all those industries somehow doubled in size over the next 10 years - and that's just impossible in the current economic paradigm - that would increase Québec's GDP by less than 1% per year.

Technology is much bigger of course (and also covers multiple industries as listed by Statcan, hence why I didn't include it in the list above) and I agree it's important. But Québec hasn't exactly been passive in that regards, with massive tax cuts and subsidies to industries like video games and AI research. If that's a competitive advantage of Québec, it's because it created it over the last 2 decades and doubling down on the support of this industry is going to have serious diminishing returns.

> AB is moving into green energy in a big way, because we have tons of wind and sun.

Yes, I've noticed and that's great, although it still has a lot of catch-up to do to compared to Ontario and Québec, at least it's doing something.

Unfortunately, I don't see how it's relevant in regards to the points I was making. If Alberta was moving away from O&G, I'd be ecstatic and wholly supportive for plenty of reasons. But it's quite obvious that a majority of Albertans are hell bent on doubling down on oil and it's going to take a lot before they change their mind.

And that brings me to the point you made about ""neither party has to leave to achieve the desired outcome"". While true, I think the easiest way to achieve the desired outcome while leaving the federation intact is by having Canada step away from O&G. I think it's much more likely and feasible that Québec becomes independent or the Wexit happens."

I'll oversimplify to make this point fit inside 1000 words. You're probably aware that Québec doesn't have that much natural resources to export? That means Québec's economy has to rely on secondary and tertiary sectors (ie. manufacturing and services). Also, Québec - along most Canadian provinces - has the distinct advantage of having a neighbour that's eager to import foreign goods (and services too, but mostly goods). That's true even when it has some protectionist hiccups.

The best strategy for Québec would then be to gear its economy towards exportation (while hedging against recessions and those protectionist hiccups of course). So long as the currency, in this case the CAD, has a relatively lower value than the neighbour's currency, this will provide Québec a [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage) and will spur the exports (thus increasing GDP, as well as attracting direct investments).

That strategy has been adopted by Québec a long while ago, but it really kicked into second gear with the NAFTA. The problem for Québec, is that other provinces did the same and generally with better results. In and of itself, that's not a problem. If your neighbour is doing well, that doesn't stop you from doing well right? Well, unless you both compete for the same market of course...

And that's the problem: Québec, Ontario and others are direct competitors on a surprisingly often forgotten market: money. 

Because when economy grows, the demand for money also grows and all else being equal, that leads to inflation. So we've created central banks with the power to nearly control money supply in order to keep the inflation in check. The main tool of central banks (the main component of the monetary policy) is the interest rate that private banks/credit unions get on their deposits at the central bank. That's called the bank rate (or policy interest rate in Canada), but it's not important for now.

Without getting into the details of how this works, the Bank of Canada will raise its interest rate to control inflation. There are multiple effects of this increase, but two of them important for this discussion are: to lower investment and raise the currency value.

So, when large provinces are doing well, and the Bank of Canada has to raise its rate (which is part of the monetary policy) to keep inflation bellow 3%, it hurts everyone nearly equally. For example (and this is only to illustrate the idea, that's not how it works in reality), if the raised rates reduces GDP growth by 1% compared to having no rate change, it hurts a lot more if you're going down to 1% (2=>1) than if you're going down to 3% (4=>3). 

The problem is that there's a big regional disparity between provinces. Some of them should have had the interest rate increase sooner, some of them shouldn't go through increased interest rate at all. But everyone use the same currency and there's nothing that anyone can do about it.

Unless someone splits from the federation and creates its own central bank and currency. Then they're free to do whatever they want, including having a fixed currency or a floating one within constraints, like China did for over a decade. But the point is, having your own monetary policy - as long as its properly managed - allows you to optimize your economy, regardless of the performance of your neighbours.

> I also don't see how either party leaving improves Quebecs position.

I think I've explained the monetary policy point enough to show how it would help Québec. Interest rates are consistently higher than they should be for the needs of Québec, that means billions less in investments and tens of billions less in exports over the years. 

This is compounded by the Dutch disease where Québec lost 20-30 billions in annual exports compared to its projection based on a CAD value of ~0.7 USD. Québec is taxing roughly a quarter of its economy. At its peak, it's ~5-7 billions in tax revenue that Québec didn't get due to lower exports caused by a high CAD value. None of that would have happened if Québec was independent or if oil-producing provinces (well, Alberta mostly) were no longer using the CAD.

It's starting to catch up now, but it takes time for industries to shift around, specially with in an aging population, and sometimes the structural changes to an industry simply doesn't allow it to return."

canada,felw7nv,t1_fedxmuy,1579232477.0,"Well, first, you need to understand that equalization is a fiscal arrangement, not an economy-based arrangement. What does that mean? It means that the only things that matter when determining equalization payments are related to taxes. There may be a correlation between economy growth and taxes, but it's not a causality.

Now, let's get into the details of how it's calculated.

The first step is to look at the average income tax (per person, or per capita) all Canadian provinces are getting. Then we look at how much how each province *would be getting if we applied the Canadian average to it*. If a province *would be* getting less than the average, then it's entitled to equalization payments.

Actually, it's not automatic after this one simple step: we do the same calculation for other sources of tax revenues: business income, consumption expenditure and property, and we count half of natural resources income. Then we add everything up and if the province is still below the average (actually, the sum of each source's average), then it gets equalization payments **in 2 years**.

Where exactly does economic growth fit in all of this? Well, there's a lot of variables at play, but let's cover a few important ones:

* If a province's economic growth is exceeded by its population growth, that will generally increase the equalization payments it gets. Remember equalization is done per capita and nominal (or real) GDP growth =/= GDP per capita growth.

* Because equalization compares provinces to the national average, if a province's economic growth is outpaced by other large province's economic growth, then it will definitely increase the equalization payments it gets. E.g. Québec could be having 4% GDP growth, but if Ontario has 5% and the rest of Canada 4%, Québec will get more equalization payments nonetheless (all else being equal).

* Economic growth doesn't automatically correspond to an increase in tax revenue in a 1:1 ratio. For example, if GDP (which is a measure of production) increases faster than wages and other personal income, then the tax revenu will increase by a lower % than GDP. How is that possible? When profits are owned by foreign entities is one case, when profits aren't given back to investors is another one (keep in mind that business income is taxed relatively low, so it doesn't budge that part of the calculation nearly as much as other tax revenue sources).

* Economic growth doesn't translate into property value (from which we derive taxes from properties). Properties, chiefly real estate, is a market and demand may or may not be spurred by economic growth. I'm sure I don't have to explain how property value is far outpacing GDP growth in markets like Toronto and Vancouver. That increases property tax revenue much faster than it should.

* The natural resources part is a relatively recent modification to the equalization system and it has some important effect in Québec. Hydroelectricity is counted as a natural resource and Hydro-Québec has seriously expanded it's exports of electricity in the last 15 years. Even if the total sales have grown modestly in the last couple of years (~250M$/yr or ~2%), the profits have grown much quicker and those get counted at half the rate they should be in the equalization formula.

On that last point, you can't really blame Québec for it, because it's the oil-producing countries that lobbied to have natural resources count at half rate and they benefit from it a lot more than Québec does.

So, I hope this helps you understand how equalization works and why it's nearly meaningless to look at nominal/real economic growth in regards to equalization."

canada,feds196,t1_fedm02s,1579018658.0,"> Are you applying inflation differently to each of the above numbers?

Yes because a payment received in the 70s will accrue a lot more ""inflation/interest"" than a payment received 5 years ago. In technical terms, it's called discounting (but it has nothing to do with actually giving a discount).

I've used exactly the same source and applied the [CPI](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=1810000501) to each year's payments.

That's complete bullshit. Just between 1988-1994, SK received 3 billions in payments. But of course, that's a long time ago and inflation ran its course.

To this day, when considering inflation, SK still has received more equalization than PEI has. At the current rate, it will take until the end of FY 2023 before PEI catches up to SK."
