Someone requiring you to ask for permission or restricting you from things that are non-harmful but make you happy are signs that you are in an abusive relationship. Regardless if you're a man and she's a female. Men can still be abused too..

There's also some hiking trails in the city and 1-2 hours away (good for a day trip) with easy driving honestly in a rental car. And the Alamo is 2 hours south of Austin if you want history.

I stayed in San Antonio and it was okay but overall I would recommend staying in Ibiza town or Playa d'en Bossa which is the other end of the island from San Antonio. I stayed at the hotel blau parc which had beautiful sunset views and was right by a little cove beach, it was nice it was quieter and more family friendly. Somewhere chill to relax at during the recovery. But if you want a more party vibe, that hotel isn't it. There are plenty of more lively hotels/hostels in San Antonio. Tbh, San Antonio was just full of trashy British tourists wanting to drug out when you have an entirely beautiful island in the Mediterranean sea. I wouldn't really do much there besides maybe a boat tour (I took one for 25 Euros) and maybe just explore during the day. Overall, Ibiza town is better. There is a really cool historic old town to explore with the most beautiful views of the sea from the top of the castle. Totally worth it to get lost for a few hours (w/ a spliff) and explore ;)
