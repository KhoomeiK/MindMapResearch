Except for the part about attending BDSM events, this answer was bullshit. Look for online sex communities - BDSM or otherwise - and find like-minded people in your area. That's the answer."

legaladvice,fee4oci,t3_eom6t5,1579026323.0,"People are engaging in wishful thinking, here. A lawyer would argue that consent was given when she chose to go home with him, after knowing what he wanted. It weakens the case of what came later, and those cases (he said, she said, with both parties drinking) tend to be a little weak already. Unless more evidence is found, I unfortunately don't think much could come of this."

I say all that to make it clear that I know my disorder about as well as one can. It has nothing to do with imposter syndrome, or whatever it is you're selling."
technology,fe4km7l,t3_enpsnc,1578860300.0,"It's almost certain that state intelligence agencies have deeply infiltrated every major social media company, Reddit included. It's the new front line of spy craft."
unpopularopinion,fe3si8w,t1_fe35gik,1578852465.0,The tone is uneven and never figures out what it wants to be. The plot is barely there. There's too much glowing green goop. The action set-pieces and the ways Hal uses his powers are remarkably uninspired. The villain and Hal are in different movies until the end. I could go on.
science,fdzyxy2,t1_fdz2cou,1578799162.0,"I wouldn't go that far. Skepticism is a vital part of science, and we should be questioning things at a fundamental level. There was a lot more evidence for Newton's laws than there is likely to ever be for the accuracy of climate models, and those ended up being overturned. That's actually why studies like the one here are so important."

science,fdy9u3a,t1_fdxvl3r,1578777564.0,"Imagine you have many different models to predict which number will be drawn at random from a hat. Numbers in the hat range from 1 to 100. You reach in and draw a number out: 78. The model that was closest predicted 81. Does that mean that model is accurate and can predict future draws? No, because one of the many models was going to be closest and that one just happened to be the winner.

I'm not saying I agree that this is a fair analogy, just that this is, I think, the professor's point."

unpopularopinion,fdnfyw8,t3_em8dai,1578584985.0,"Very true. I work in a computer and phone repair shop and most computers that 50+ year olds bring in are loaded with all sorts of garbage.

That said, it is often useful and healthy to general discourse to have a range of varying opinions from varying viewpoints. My opinion was different from the comment I replied to, and so I felt it added to the discussion.

To read between the lines, I feel like you're dancing around accusing me of being, I suppose, ""mean"". I don't agree that stating a dissenting opinion is in itself mean or cruel just because the topic is delicate, and I think the way I stated that opinion was adequately benign."
