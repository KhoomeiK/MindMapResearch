exmormon,fewkteb,t1_fewhxua,1579412962.0,"I think this example may be a bit of an extreme. I hope so anyway. My family is as TBM as TBM comes, and they would never do something this extreme, thank god. I feel so bad for OP, this is absolutely horrendous for them to deal with"

askcarsales,fefrog0,t1_fefkd5l,1579063214.0,"Totally unrelated but (keep in mind I‚Äôm a complete outsider to car sales) is there a mindset that customers have of leasing being bad?

HealthyFood,fe3t20b,t1_fe3slvq,1578852635.0,I have a blendtech blender and I usually fill it about halfway with spinach. Although if I drink that much spinach for too many days in a row I tend to have some...gastrointestinal side effects. TMI sorry.
HealthyFood,fe3s08l,t1_fe3p9n4,1578852298.0,"Oh like, two big handfuls ish. I don‚Äôt really measure. It blends down to nothing though so you can pack quite a bit in."

pharmacy,fdhqv2l,t3_el94mo,1578428384.0,"I love my job and I love being a pharmacist.

PSLF,fd47nv2,t1_fd3iot7,1578165113.0,I follow all the news on it and I certify every six months and keep all hard copies. Im very ocd lol. I‚Äôm hopeful but it‚Äôs also just so stressful!! The success stories definitely help ease my anxiety about it.
PSLF,fd35eev,t1_fd2u5v7,1578154871.0,"You nailed it. I make about $150k a year, contribute as much as possible to 401k and 403b accounts; and pay $900 a month. One sad year I was paying $1600 a month (filed taxes joint with my husband our first year married. Big mistake). I never took out any loans for my undergrad, only for my doctorate program. So yeah. Hopefully PSLF works or I‚Äôm screwed."

PSLF,fcvj0s1,t3_ej4d53,1578003124.0,"I just printed out my ecf for the year and payment history. I have paid over $50k in monthly payments over the last five years and my principle balance on my loan has gone down $435. I honesty don‚Äôt know what the f I‚Äôll do if it doesn‚Äôt pan out for me. 

Halfway there, my fingers are crossed."

ParentingADHD,fcng79t,t3_eaudz1,1577811055.0,"We have found lists work miracles for our ADHD 10 year old. We literally put down every step of getting ready (brush teeth, comb hair, get dressed, eat breakfast) and he checks them off as he completes it and once everything is checked off he gets screen time, or on weekends we‚Äôll put down a few extra chores and then go do something fun when it‚Äôs all done. 

I don‚Äôt know what clicked with the lists vs the ten billion other reward systems we tried, but it has worked remarkably well for us."

exmormon,fckn0aa,t3_ehnq7j,1577728848.0,The comment about mental illness and people being treated like sinners makes sense. I was totally made to feel like the reason I have anxiety is because I wasn‚Äôt righteous enough. The rest are laughable.
exmormon,fckmtxu,t1_fcklmb4,1577728743.0,Came to say the same thing. I was made to feel having an anxiety disorder was because I WaSnT LiViNg My LiFe CorReTLy
