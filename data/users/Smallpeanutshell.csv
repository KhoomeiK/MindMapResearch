RaidShadowLegends,ffbpo5h,t1_ffa4fj2,1579777473.0,I cleared 15 auto with apoth ch rhazin nazana maulie :) They killed maulie with taunt then targeted apoth when not taunted but couldnt kill him cus of heal and nazana buff. Rhazin and coldheart did the work
RaidShadowLegends,ffbpnir,t1_ffbfebh,1579777449.0,Well yea u can cheese just to clear the stages but he is useless on auto and u gotta be able to auto 15 and 17+ and then 20
RaidShadowLegends,ff9zjwe,t1_ff9z7vz,1579724854.0,"Thank you :) My rhazin CH and apoth are fully built, but my nazana and lua isnt. How should I build them? What sets/stats to aim for?"
dogs,ff5vl3l,t1_feu3yru,1579611746.0,I haven't found the same fox anywhere. I've no idea where we got it either since it was 7 years ago. Most likely gonna try making him in to a franken-fox
dogs,ff5ved6,t1_feyjhnc,1579611571.0,"I'm not sure how we would save the tail or the legs though, maybe just by covering it with new fabric? Would have to do it leg by leg so it saved the stench yeah. Will look in to it!"
dogs,ff5vbnn,t1_fex3znl,1579611498.0,"It's very similar, don't think that's it tho :("
dogs,ff5v9od,t1_feuzg99,1579611446.0,Her toy is stuffed! We have some less stuffed foxes already but she doesn't want them hahah
dogs,ff5v70x,t1_feugfgy,1579611376.0,"We actually have one of those, at least very similar to one of those already. Got ignored! :p"
RaidShadowLegends,ff4l4r4,t1_ff3y8cs,1579566253.0,"Right so that's why he's a dick to people in his stream, makes salty ""sub only"" streams like the one in this screenshot and shittalks literally everyone? Cus he wants to support the game and give feedback? Are you serious???? Better be joking with defending this guy....."
sadcringe,fev7app,t1_fepuime,1579393983.0,"This shit happened to me. Me and my ex-bestfriend only talked over snapchat. At some point he decided to text me and found out I didn't have his number saved (I got a new phone 1 yr before that and didn't transfer old contacts) so he stopped talking to me and now ignores me. Makes no sense, but whatever."
dogs,fetk9to,t1_fete5hq,1579376288.0,"I guess those years of funk can't be replaced by some new, nice smelling toy :P She refueses to play with any other toy. She brings foxy to bed, brings it around the house, cleans him and plays with him. Silly dogs."

dankmemes,fdceb70,t1_fd9hdq7,1578272798.0,"It isn't p2w. The people who say it is have no idea what they're talking about. The goal of the game is to build teams for all content at the hardest level. By spending money u just skip all of the character building, working ur way up, etc. The game is ""pay if u're impatient"". I don't spend any money on it and I love the game. Sure I progress slower than paying players but there is literally no rush. I make progress on a daily basis, with 0 money spent."
RaidShadowLegends,fd53mxh,t3_ejyze1,1578173887.0,I got this comment when attempting to take it on my alt account after already taking it on my main. If u've already used the amazon account to claim the rewards on one account and are attempting to grab them on another then theres ur answer.
mildlyinfuriating,fcut685,t3_eivat6,1577988004.0,That looks just like the locker room I had for PE in high school
creepyPMs,fcsrq0j,t1_fcrqikh,1577923424.0,"That sounds so much like me, these exact things have happened to me. I'm 19 and still ace. Would love to chat about experiences if u'd be up to it (I only recently accepted that I'm ace and I'm struggling a bit)"
teenagers,fc2w7eb,t1_fc1yhl2,1577375676.0,It's normal when looking out of a car window because the curve of the window makes it look like that. It's not normal if it's like that when u see it when looking without the car window.
teenagers,fc2w15g,t1_fc1gtef,1577375545.0,Glasses fix it for me. Got 'diagnosed' with astigmatism when I got my eyes checked. Tho if u're looking out a car window it's always gonna look like that cus of the curve of the window
insaneparents,fbxfatl,t3_eenv0v,1577184406.0,My dad literally yesterday
