Showerthoughts,fcwao4k,t1_fcw5d42,1578021016.0,Sorry you're girl got injured :(  But it's good that it doesn't really impede her!
Showerthoughts,fcwa721,t1_fcw1eya,1578020700.0,I hate to tell you but they've already begun to learn how to fly. (Look up Australian flying spiders. They can't go cross-continental... yet.)
Showerthoughts,fcw9ohj,t1_fcw0xu9,1578020355.0,Ah snap!

Scarymovies,fcoqxlc,t1_fcllwlf,1577839175.0,Can't outrun her if you can't even get out the front door!
AskReddit,fcol2zv,t1_fcnlscv,1577834938.0,Part of me was disappointed it wasn't a rickroll.
natureismetal,fcokxzs,t1_fcof4pr,1577834841.0,"Ahh ok, it must be the dwarf wallaby I was thinking of. Thank you for the info! :)"
aww,fcokrup,t1_fcnygfn,1577834716.0,"Aww poor babies :(  Well at least they're living a healthy life now. I've got 2 strays we adopted from the outdoors too, but they were kittens when we rescued them so they grew out of the food insecurity after awhile. I've heard there's ways where you can retrain your cat's brain so they know and understand food will always be available, but it takes a lot of time and consistency doing it which isn't such a viable option when you've got multiple food-obsessed cats. I really wish you luck though and hope you find a solution, but you've already done an amazing job taking care of and getting them healthy!"
AskReddit,fcoehhq,t1_fcngi01,1577830274.0,...maybe they're trying to hint at they want a sex swing for next Christmas?
natureismetal,fcoco1f,t3_ei3zku,1577828996.0,"I always thought wallabies were smaller, fluffier, and chunkier? These look more like small/juvenile kangaroos?"
mildlyinfuriating,fco37vu,t3_ei203r,1577823226.0,....Well at least the rest looks pretty.
ChoosingBeggars,fco30eb,t1_fcntp9u,1577823113.0,"They indeed had bigger brains! Just not in the way you're thinking. Their skulls, compared to homo sapiens, hold a slightly larger volume, so it can be theorized they had larger brains spatial-wise. But bigger brains doesn't necessarily mean greater ""intelligence"" (I use the quotes since there's different types of intelligence, though we usually use computational/problem-solving intelligence as the base definition), such as comparing brain size to that of whales and elephants. It's theorized that homo sapiens had more developed parts of the brain (frontal or central cortex I think?) that were focused on problem-solving and language, while Neanderthals had more developed parts that concentrated on interpreting external stimuli. If I remember correctly, Neanderthals had better developed visual cortex, so basically they had better reaction times but homo sapiens could build better tools and come up with better game plans."
aww,fcnwrji,t1_fcni4y4,1577819992.0,"Have you tried switching brands or ingredients? It could be an allergy issue, or even that they're eating more than they should be in one sitting due to a perceived food insecurity. Watering down the food or switching to wet food is definitely a good idea though and should help a lot."
aww,fcnw6df,t1_fcnil62,1577819653.0,"It kind of sounds like there might be a physiological problem involved. Even with the way you feed him, will he still be constantly asking for food or does he actually get full?"
pics,fcnu1dz,t3_ei5kqd,1577818403.0,"This is so wonderful, congrats to you and your family! I'm an adult now, but my stepdad is officially adopting me on the 6th, and we're both really excited to start off the new year that way too :)"
2meirl4meirl,fcm6coz,t1_fclfufj,1577765383.0,"....not to sound cocky, but wouldn't the mace burn him if it was sprayed close to her eyes? I'm just saying, even dried mace should still be able to cause extensive discomfort to such a sensitive organ."
HumansBeingBros,fcjqgkp,t3_ehjzla,1577699466.0,I've always wondered if the bras that get thrown are ones that you actually use daily or if they're just ones that you keep at the back of your underwear drawer because they aren't comfortable but you can't justify just throwing out.
medizzy,fcg6h68,t3_eggs0m,1577636922.0,"It's fine if he's back to working (probably really uncomfortable though) just so long as he's taking care of the wound and wearing his shoes correctly. Even with it being wrapped up, he doesn't want his socks or shoes rubbing against it as he's moving (as in causing the delicate healing skin to get rubbed off or scratched). He just has to make sure he's keeping it sterile and putting antibiotic/first-aid cream on it, and then alternating between keeping it wrapped up and moist, and then letting it air dry a bit.

Edit: depending on if it still looks like this or not, I'd probably snip off some of that damaged dead skin that's practically hanging off. Get video and post if you do though (let us witness the medical grossness)"

PetTheDamnCat,fc0r8o3,t3_efcvr0,1577297695.0,Half the time it looks more like he's face-planting than actually trying to bite.
toptalent,fbmo25p,t3_edwi5s,1576986629.0,That's the face of someone who knows they the best.
