todayilearned,fdmgs0e,t1_fdmgg4l,1578549374.0,">Off topic a little, but what I find amusing is this: I'm sure the idea of 'fire brigade insurance', and coming to our aid only if you had appropriate insurance would been absurd to most in this day and age. Most would agree that a public-funded service if the best approach for everyone. Yet that's the health care setup in the US, and that absurdity is how most outside the US (and many inside I'm sure) view the system!

Many do, but unfortunately all the propaganda forced on us regarding public services, government spending and healthcare has convinced a great many people that publicly funded healthcare can't work in the US."

GenZanarchist,fdd1fjc,t1_fdd0hlr,1578290995.0,"Idk how familiar you are with the mod, but to sum it up it's an alternate history mod which envisions an alternate world where the Central Powers won the first world war. In the Kaiserreich timeline, the French and British governments fall to leftist revolutions, and in the timeframe of the game the exact natures of these revolutions take shape in either ""Radical Socialist"" (not exactly sure what ideologies this represented in the game), Syndicalist, or Totalist (totalitarian) forms. There are some other changes to history, and quite a few seem to have been made to serve gameplay over ""realism,"" (many changes served to turn less interesting regions of the world to play in HOI4 into more exciting shitshows) but in what little HOI4 I've played, I preferred Kaiserreich to the base game."

I too am blessed to have been born to wonderful parents and to have been blessed with two brothers who are wonderful human beings I'll be best friends with for the rest of our lives. The work my parents have done to give myself and my brothers the best lives they could has certainly paid off, and I'm sure your kids feel the same! Happy new year, pal!"
