The aircraft is very expensive but the maintenance and parts cost even more. Plus it seems to be as buggy as hell which is fine for the US they can fix it 1000 times for nothing but it will cost us billions. Lockheed Martin is based in the US pays taxes, it makes the F-35 the US government buys it with money from taxes. Round and round we go.

The cost per flight hours is nuts at F-35 $30,000US vs $10,000US for the F-18.

And the Cons couldn't manage to buy them either the ten years they were in power. From 2009 to 2014 Peter McKay flip-flopped all over the place saying yes, no, yes, no. He and his fellow Cons knew the F-35 were too much and way behind schedule and buggy as hell."
