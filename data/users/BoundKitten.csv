IAmA,fg20a8t,t1_fg1t8rv,1580435916.0,"But isn’t that because the people who die tend to die quickly, whereas being fully recovered takes time? [Also, I found a 170 number that is from people who have been cured and discharged from the hospital, not even counting all people who have made a recovery.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/coronavirus-latest-updates.html) They don’t expect most people to die from it, they expect the vast majority to recover without any lasting effects, correct? [At least that’s what it sounds like to me from government reports.](https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/01/560316/most-coronavirus-patients-will-recover) Most people are recovered or *recovering* (not fully recovered yet, since that takes time, but expected to recover) and aren’t expected to die. The way it was written makes it sound as though there’s a 51%+ mortality rate, which just seems hysterical and misleading. 

Also, [it sounds like there’s a considerable amount of underreporting.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/world/asia/27china-coronavirus-health.html) Hospitals are reportedly not testing everyone coming in with symptoms. They don’t even have enough test kits. They’re being saved for the more severe cases. So the reporting is going to be heavily skewed towards the cases requiring hospitalization, not the mild cases that people have already recovered from."
IAmA,fg1q8dl,t1_fg1osih,1580431631.0,"Ah, interesting, thanks for the clarification on that. And I expect that it probably will increase, that wasn’t my argument. My point is that I’d like to see some data about there being more people dying than recovering, since nothing I’ve been able to find asserts that and saying that there’s a higher mortality rate than the flu doesn’t support that argument."
IAmA,fg1ojk3,t1_fg1m7j5,1580430861.0,That’s not where the 2% number comes from. The 2% mortality rate is from the World Health Organization.
todayilearned,fg1lkm7,t1_fg0fut3,1580429283.0,"You realize that people aren’t saying it’s *bad*. They’re just saying you can get a high from it depending on how you use it, which is true. I’ve definitely been helped by it tremendously but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t given me “high” feelings in the past. It’s not a super strong high, but it also depends on your unique body/brain chemistry and tolerance."
todayilearned,fg1ks6e,t1_fg1dfw1,1580428874.0,"It’s highly dependent on the strain. Green strains tend to be like mild caffeine buzz with a little euphoria and some pain relief. Red is like a weak opiate, so it helps tremendously with pain and sleep."
todayilearned,fg1jjc3,t1_fg0akup,1580428248.0,"Hard disagree, you are way more likely to get ripped off at head shop in my experience. After buying at multiple online stores I settled on Super Speciosa because of their thorough testing procedures (and because I can also get really good CBD there) but there are others out there that have similar safety standards. [Other GMP certified Kratom suppliers are listed here.](http://www.americankratom.org/abou-aka/gmp-participants.html)"
todayilearned,fg1hc2q,t1_fg0a9bc,1580427114.0,"I like Super Speciosa, they also have the best CBD I’ve ever been able to find. If you’re sensitive to caffeine at all, stick with red strains. Red’s better for pain anyway. I’ve heard good things about Happy Hippo as well. Wherever you buy it, they should make batch lab testing available. Super Speciosa has a [whole section on their website](https://superspeciosa.com/kratom/lab-testing/) about the importance of safety testing. I really recommend reading through it. They test every single batch for safety, which I appreciate. They’re one of the only kratom companies I’ve found that is this careful."
IAmA,fg1ei8w,t1_fg1e1xa,1580425674.0,"I think he’s responding to this part of the comment: 

>	a rapidly spreading disease **which more people have died from than recovered from.** 

A 2% mortality rate is still a 98% recovery rate, meaning that more people are recovering than dying.

Edit: which is not to say that I personally think that people are blowing this out of proportion, I’ve been following the info very closely and personally take it very seriously. I just think that the comment was worded poorly."

news,ffwdyt0,t1_ffw301n,1580297259.0,"Are you aware that the divorce rate includes individuals who have been married multiple times? It skews the numbers because once you’ve gotten divorced, your chance of getting divorced in the future increases. 

Divorce rates are actually dropping drastically. You get a poor idea of it by just dividing the year’s divorce numbers by the year’s marriage numbers. With that, you aren’t getting any idea of the longevity of those marriages or the generations divorcing. The people getting married that year are not all the ones getting divorced. 

When you measure the divorce rate of a given generation (by seeing how many people born in X year are still together 15 years later), you see that the divorce rate for people who got married in 2000s was only 15%, compared to the average 35% divorce rate of marriages from the 1970s and 1980s. Millennials especially are bringing divorce rates to the lowest they’ve been in decades."
EdAnonymousAdults,ffwcr51,t3_evcyux,1580295659.0,"She might have just misunderstood what they were saying. We didn’t talk about things in terms of carbs in treatment, instead there are starches. There’s so much info thrown at you that I suppose it can be easy to misunderstand or misremember things you were told. But I’m my experience the dietary education was pretty spot on. Every center is different though, so it’s possible they’re just a bad program I guess."

mildlyinteresting,ffutgga,t1_ffusrke,1580249021.0,"Yeah, if you added ice to it I suppose it could function as a cooler for a while, but that seems like it could be more trouble than it’s worth, since you’d have to get the melted ice/water out after. Probably lifts out, so it wouldn’t be the worst situation, but it’s probably best to just store dry goods that do well in cooler temperatures there.

What’s cool is that these are often on rails with multiple storage boxes, so you can just slide over a different box with other stuff. Clever way to use the space."
mildlyinteresting,ffurd93,t1_fft8ek0,1580247884.0,"It’s not actually a cooler. It’s cooler than the house because it’s built into the floor, but it’s just a storage box. Common in Japan since the houses are build further off the ground."
DIY,ffuqhmh,t1_ffu0fwk,1580247382.0,"I wondered why no one was remarking on how terribly worn those parquet floors were. It seems like people missed that detail. I don’t blame you for just pulling them out, especially since they were so thin anyway. It didn’t look like the highest quality parquet. 

Design your house to your own tastes. You’re the one living there. No matter what you do, it’s probably going to be dated in 30 years anyway."
DIY,ffuq00d,t1_fftod2k,1580247102.0,Also that parquet flooring was in terrible condition and was already so thin that maybe resurfacing it wasn’t a viable option.
