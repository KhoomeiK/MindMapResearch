From Wikipedia 

Rumor is that a pedestrian on Fifty-seventh Street, Manhattan, stopped Jascha Heifetz and inquired, ""Could you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?"" ""Yes,"" said Heifetz. ""Practice!""

The “Practice man, practice” version is from George Carlin’s retelling of it which was the first time I heard it."

Also, and this may not be for everyone, I also find that going to concerts in groups is a pain because a performative level of “enjoyment” is sometimes expected by that one friend who needs to see everyone yelling and cheering to their satisfaction. You know the guy, the “I’ll organize everyones’s fun” guy. Alone I can lose myself in a show and cheer and react without the yay bro high five isn’t this great mentality. Basically just tuning everything out except the show is amazing."

facepalm,fegrs9i,t3_ep2x76,1579101029.0,"Edit:

I’ve deleted that link after I just received an earnest comment asking me to please not post that picture there. Of course not, I don’t post there I don’t partake, it’s just a cringey weirdo sub I wandered across once and it seemed funny in this context. In retrospect, that was a mistake because I had no idea it wasn’t NSFW gated. Of course I knew it was NSFW, but it didn’t register with me that there was no warning. 

I apologize to OP, Mrs OP and anyone who took a risky click to that sad sub.

Second edit: there where a lot of typos I felt I needed to correct for the sake of the clarity of my message. I can only attribute such carelessness to my being tired and worn out after a long bout of self abuse I undertook after pouring over endless pictures of redditor’s mothers."

Which is why those subs and this one have become largely rubbish.
