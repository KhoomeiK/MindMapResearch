Lost social circle due to bullying and eventual mental illness causing isolation.
Always had it at the back of my mind that I would just make new friends. Started working 24/7, got house and financially stable but now have zero self esteem and still suffer bullying at work.
I did have girlfriends at school and lots of friends but things happened that made me turn my back on society. Really wish I'd opened up and told my parents and got help ten years ago.
In my mind I'm not actually anti social and willing to give people a chance but theres always a voice telling me to not even try because of what happened.
I'm thinking of just using escorts to get it out of the way and it's quite easy to do where I live.
Is it really any less emotionally connected than a hookup? 
The fa30+ forum is actually more helpful and less emotional than this one. Imo people at 18/19 posting that they are fa is total nonsense."

I fully believe that it’s a bad thing now and can change lives both within porn and out with. Got lots of problems and feel that this first step will help to deal with other things. 

I feel like porn is now fully accepted into society as normal now, this is wrong but I would feel wrong to tell others to stop. I feel that maybe porn sites should be made to put up warning pop ups to tell you to limit viewing. No chance of that though until sexual violence or fetish stuff becomes like an epidemic."

What I mean by that is you have to experience workplace bullying or mobbing in order to understand. People think that who gets attacked must either deserve it or they are just sheep who don't have a backbone and just enable the bullies.

Bullying in the workplace goes against everything decent people understand about society but for me the worst part is the denial and gaslighting."

I also hate the advice like just go out more or be more social, just meet people.
I'm actually not anti social at all, once you lose your social circle it's incredibly difficult to recover especially when your trust, esteem and confidence are all floored.
Take these normies and put them in your shoes for a week and then it would be a total meltdown within hours but they act as if they're indestructible, amazingly perfect people who offer so much to their friends. I see quite a few people who are totally needy just by how they post on facebook or like certain posts or laugh at stupid shit, just to fit in.
I would love to have a few friends who lift each other up, cant say I've ever experienced that and before I was alone I must have known over 100 people. Maybe this is normal?"

virgin,fcxgpi1,t3_ejc64n,1578062479.0,"I believe it’s social situations and a bit of luck.
Say you were going out drinking and partying in your late teens and early twenties it would happen. It happens to really shallow talentless horrible people simply because they are there in a situation. If you’re not out and about and meeting members of the opposite sex or don’t have a social circle where people meet each other it’s difficult. I lost my social circle and stopped going out and my self esteem shattered so couldn’t even bring myself to try online dating or cold approaching. In the uk cold approach in the street is unusual. It usually happens around being drunk and going to bars or clubs.
Self improving isn’t a waste even if you don’t meet anyone, you’re still better and self esteem will improve. There’s guys out there who beat up their partners then another woman will knowingly have a relationship with them. People are messed up and so is life, don’t be jealous just keep pushing forward."

The commercial stuff such as say the prodigy or hip hop would resell at $5 to $10.
Obscure rave white labels or rare hip hop would sell for up to $200 each in good condition.
If they are all ruined then obviously this effects the value. Would ask to look through and if possible check by listening to a few or under sunlight. If you got them for under 2K then you could be sitting on enough money to buy a decent car. Like 5k to 10k quite easily.
