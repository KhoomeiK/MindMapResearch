Curious, considering all the alcoholics on this thread seems to have a black and white view towards sobriety and yet seem to keep relapsing. Quite frankly kratom is a far better alternative for your body than alcohol, especially as far as your liver is concerned. If this options is a no go for you, I might suggest talking to a certified MD for possible medication for withdrawals. Or you can keep getting support through reddit. Your choice."

Places close to the Mannasas campus and Annandale campus is Where you want to go for the best price for your money.

If your going cold turkey, prepare for nicotine withdrawal. If your against vaping you can do the nicotine transdermal patch (expensive) or the nicotine gum for cravings. It's also good you got the gum and sunflower seeds! A lot of people overlook the psychological aspect of not having a large wad of grizzly in their cheek.

If you go to GMU thinking ""I need to graduate quickly"", you will graduate on time but will face an uphill battle trying to find a job and be very limited in your potential job scope.
