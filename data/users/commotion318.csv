getdisciplined,fgdbu2y,t1_fgd6d4u,1580680854.0,Damnit does that make me racist by default? I need to do my research before quoting old dead white men.

As Mark Twain once said “If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.”"

Khruangbin,fg7wtxv,t1_ffy0eli,1580603494.0,Absolutely man. I gotta be real and honest. I’m happy you’re able to overcome and find yourself. I know it takes time and doesn’t happen over night. We can find some peace in this world and feel whole again. The power of music is real.
wholesomememes,fg7vsax,t1_fg7p8mc,1580602719.0,Have it your way!
getdisciplined,fg4ire5,t3_ewqrcf,1580504092.0,"I too have severe depression, anxiety, and stress. My job deals with life safety and is fast paced. It’s constantly chaotic. 

In order for me to manage all the stress and anxiety is to practice meditation on a daily basis. I meditate/pray Before I get out of Bed in the morning. Listen to positive affirmation tracks on YouTube. I try my best to stop negative thought as they enter my mind. 

I meditate for 3-5 minutes Before I go into work. I take deep breaths through my nose and exhale out of my mouth. I’ll do this through out the day. 

I meditate at the end of the day as I’m laying in bed going to sleep. 

I make sure I get plenty of rest every night. I don’t stay up like I use to. I’ll take melatonin at bed time. 

I started exercising. I like to work out in the morning if I got plenty of rest. I’ll go after work if I can’t do it in the morning. 

I started a whole food plant based diet. I have so much energy and a better well being to conquer the day. 

I learned to deal with negative coworkers/customers and not take anything to heart. 

I stopped drinking. It’s not a healthy outlet for a stressful day."
