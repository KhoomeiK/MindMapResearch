If you go back and read what I said, you should hopefully notice that I wasn't accusing you of anything. I worded my observations on your word choice and phrasing as exactly that, an observation, which I then presented to you in hopes that you would acknowledge or even examine your currently held values. Even refuting my inference through a well-constructed argument would have silenced me. I see people making arguments like yours all the time, it would simply not be productive to get angry at every single one of them if nudging them in the direction of self-reflection was an equally good option.

What you've done across all four of your replies, however, is simply just vehemently ignored that phrasing can imply anything and instead either tried to turn the attention to the main post (which is irrelevant) or repeated ""But I didn't *outright* say anything!"" I hope for your sake that this is not an intentional misunderstanding, because the alternative is an incredibly bad faith way to argue.

Edit: 

> However, the only direct comment in this thread from me about trans people was that no one should be intentionally misgendered

Provably false; you delineate between normal situations and abnormal ones, then claim that misgendering should not happen in the normal ones while leaving the abnormal situations up in the air. The intentionality of the action does not factor in at any point, as you do not comment on it. At best you could read this as a supportive statement that tries hard to retain grip on realistic expectations of the layman, while at worst you could read it as someone desperately clawing for a free pass to misgender someone free of consequence. You have reprimanded me for reading into any implications, so in an effort to placate I will instead consider both of these options equally plausible."

ChoosingBeggars,ff2mzj0,t1_fectc70,1579514069.0,">am I required to indulge your feelings about your identity, or can I just treat you like a thief? 

Therein lies the problem. That's not approaching someone's identity from a perspective of acceptance, that's essentially saying ""okay, you *say* you're a man/woman, but I know you're really not."" You wouldn't start calling a cisgendered man a woman just because he stole from you, would you?
