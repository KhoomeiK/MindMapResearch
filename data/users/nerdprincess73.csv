I cut out silicones in my products, because with my straight hair and hella oily scalp, I turned into a grease slick in about 6 hours. Finding a silicone free conditioner took actually several months, and the one I bought cost $30. (there are now drugstore options, y'all) But my hair dresser legitimately asked me what I had done to my hair, because it was so soft. (I'mma repeat that for emphasis. My hair dresser, who handles hair all day, asked what I did, because my hair was very very soft). 

I'm not saying this is the solution for everyone, of course, because if you have dry hair, or really need the slip to detangle or whatever, its more important. 

Just don't use monat"

Weird story, when I was a senior in high school, there was a girl a couple of years behind me who was about 5 feet tall and thin as a rail, and right after memorial day (vaguely relevant), she popped out a baby at 38 weeks, like, almost fully cooked. I saw this girl with my own eyes at a marching band thing, and you could not tell. At all. And baby was healthy. This shit happens. 

And it's probably not as common as it seems. These stories just kind of stand out. Of the dozen or so teen pregnancies at my high school, this was the only total surprise. But 600 people now know this girl who had a baby out of nowhere.  And for every person who has one of these stories about either going through it themselves or knowing someone who did, there's thousands who have only heard about it second or third hand."
raisedbynarcissists,fdpnu1a,t3_emjfzq,1578634049.0,"Something that I've read (though I haven't been able to do this, bc therapy expensive) is that it may help to use your first session as more of an interview with them. You're interviewing them for the job of helping you with your shit. A couple of good points are to 1) make sure they don't have values which conflict with your existence (esp in the manner of queer people, and your identity, but also in matters of faith and religion). and to ask if they've gone to therapy themselves. For two of the reasons you mentioned above. We all carry shit. We do. But as a patient, who is paying to get help, you should not be acting as a sounding board for your therapists problems (there may be a certain level of sharing, for example, if they had a narc parent, they might say something like 'I had a parent much like this, these are some of the behaviors I remember"" or using their own experience to validate you, for example: in instances of gaslighting ""You experienced this, it was real, I have had similar experiences"" type of thing. It can also be helpful for some people to feel a bit of reciprocity and sharing to feel comfortable.) The other reason is to try to avoid being randomly triggered by something your patient is trying to heal from. If they (the therapist) has already done some therapy, and done *their* work, it reduces the chance that a) they'll stumble across a trigger they didn't realize they had or b) be triggered by something they *know* they experienced but didn't ever address, and have a situation like the ones mentioned above. 

Of course, even this can't weed out all the problems, but it's at least a place to start. There are also a lot of decent lists online for other questions you might want to ask when you first start seeing someone new."
antiMLM,fdir1ui,t1_fdi1d7s,1578449125.0,"There was this art installation which was a knitted skeleton, and one of my college classmates was like 'yo, I'll give you 40 bucks for you to make one' And I was like... This shit would take me 200+ hours. I was *full* of rage. Like. You want me to pattern out a whole ass skeleton. Based on 3 photos, of a *Professional artist's work*. And then knit it all. By hand. While I was working 50 hours a week, juggling 2 part time jobs, and just scraping by. I mean, I was actually seething. 

I mean, my sister wants stuff all the time, because it's cute and fun. And i don't mind making her things. But I did lay down the rule that she has to buy the pattern, if it's a paid pattern, because I kind of wanted it to sink in that it gets expensive."

facepalm,fcizqtx,t3_eh9mbj,1577673717.0,"My best friend's girlfriend was called to the nurse's office to talk about her pregnancy (which she wasn't), and how we got there was quite the story.  (He was 17, I was 16, and the girlfriend was 15, almost 16--her bday was a couple months out). Now, some of this is based on assumptions, but we couldn't think of another way this rumor started at the same time as us making these jokes, so here goes. 

My sister gave me a shirt with kind of an empire waist, and it kind of made my boobs more obvious. Not like, wildly so, but like, noticeable. 

And she said to me ""That shirt makes you look pregnant"". I asked her to clarify because like, I was skinny as hell, and you couldn't see my stomach at all the way the shirt hung, so I was like ????? And she said bc boobs. 

Now, I shared this with my best friend, because it was hilarious, right? So, we're sitting in band, and I say ""Hey (friend), that shirt makes you look pregnant"". And he laughed, because it was funny. Because the idea of a teenage boy's shirt making him look pregnant was fucking hilarious. 

 And then later that day, his girlfriend came up to us and goes ""why was I just called to the nurse and asked if I'm pregnant?"" 

And our best guess is that someone assumed that when we were joking about him looking pregnant, someone overheard and assumed that it somehow meant his girlfriend, and the rumor got all the way to the fucking teachers and the goddamn nurse. 

So. There's how my shirt got my best friend's girlfriend pregnant."
