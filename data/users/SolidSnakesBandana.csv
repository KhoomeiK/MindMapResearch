What you've done here is reveal that you're a hugely judgmental piece of shit, on Unethical Pro Tips of all fucking places. I hope you're never at a point in your life where you feel the only way to not die is to play music in the street."
UnethicalLifeProTips,feinhgp,t3_epbqcd,1579142656.0,"If your state has no laws against panhandling you can just find someplace and hold a sign of some kind indicating that you want money. Or not even necessarily say you want money, the sign can be something clever. People will know what you're doing. One of the most successful signs I've seen was literally ""Fuck You Pay Me"" and people *loved* it. Props will be helpful here. I used a giant hiking backpack. If you have a dog, this is a plus. Be mindful of where you pick, people have to be easily able to get to you without putting you or themselves in danger.

If you could play the guitar, I would suggest standing next to stop signs and playing/singing songs. In this case you wouldn't need a sign, people will naturally get the idea. Gas stations, Wal-marts and strip malls work best. This might not work if your state has strict laws on panhandling, so do research ahead of time. Colorado for instance has no laws against panhandling that I'm aware of, but in Florida they might arrest you, something I personally witnessed. If you don't have a sign you can just argue that you're just playing music and get out of getting arrested (this happened to me).

If you can't play an instrument then you might be able to get away with a pre-recorded instrumental of some sort. When I did it with guitar I went through the same 5 songs on a loop. People will only be seeing you for 30 seconds so being repetitive isn't an issue. Another thing I would do would be to park near gas stations or at the far end of a gas station parking lot, put down an empty gas jug, sit on the back of my car and just play the guitar. Eventually someone will come over and give you money or fill up some or all of your gas jug. Or the gas station attendant will kick you out. Once again if the cops come there's no sign so you can talk your way out of it.

I feel like its worth mentioning that as a woman I feel like you're most likely at a higher risk of getting harassed but maybe that's not true. I'd highly suggest having a partner. This stuff only works until you get kicked out, then that place is off-limits. Don't push it. As far as how much money you can get, that varies wildly by location. Some places you'll get a lot, others practically nothing. I made over $1000 in a day outside of a random Wal-mart in Kansas but that was by far my best haul. One time in Washington D.C. I made literally nothing and it fucking sucked."

FalloutMods,fegrrtf,t3_ep1j94,1579101021.0,"My first thought is that any modded armor and weapons you use are probably going to be unbalanced unless it was made with Horizon in mind. My main issue with Horizon is that it kinda works at early levels but falls apart fairly quickly. It starts off really hard and feels good at first, but as the hours go on the more the cracks start to show. I dropped my last playthrough after I reached level 15 and became effectively invisible during stealth and made all encounters suddenly trivial. It seriously messes with the flow of the game, as the first major Minutemen mission at that Factory or whatever it was becomes impossible until you get stronger.
