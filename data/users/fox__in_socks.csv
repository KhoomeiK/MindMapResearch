workingmoms,ffmdham,t3_eu27wx,1580052910.0,"No way could I stay home, but I have wished I could if I'm being honest. But my income is too significant,  I have a great retirement (pension), and because of my health insurance, our premiums are completely free for our entire family.  But, as this chart shows, the income loss would just be too significant if I stayed home."
workingmoms,ffi8by5,t3_etra42,1579967704.0,Wow that was really stupid of your boss to say why you were not promoted.  That's very illegal.

loseit,fegsn8t,t1_fegrzok,1579101608.0,Yes it has helped my anxiety a ton. I have only been on it 6 weeks and have felt an enormous change. I figure I'm in adjustment period with the meds and my new job and hopefully things will even out
loseit,fegsfx9,t1_fegr45y,1579101472.0,"Really, anything that's in the kitchen. No I don't meal plan. I work full time and am in school full time with a family,  but I should really find the time to meal plan.
