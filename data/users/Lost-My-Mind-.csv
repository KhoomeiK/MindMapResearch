I basically am not a fan of WWE from Mid April until mid-august. Then I'll watch for a week. Then not a fan from late august until mid-January. From here, I'll watch occasionally. Not every week. Until Early April. 

And you might ask ""How is that being a fan?"" to which I reply ""During my off time, what do they give you to be a fan of?"" 

I find that most wrestling fans do nothing but complain about WWE......and it's not like their complaints aren't valid. Complaints over who gets pushed, stupid and forced writting, kevin dunn's entire existance, it's all very legitimate to complain about. 

But the thing that pushes me away the most is that they have 1 hour of content on a 3 hour show. The end result being that they have the same fueds, the same matches, dragging on, week after week, month after month. Meanwhile, it's nothing new. I remember almost 20 years ago, complaining that HHH is having the same matches every week, cutting the same promo every week. 

Then it was John Cena. 

Now it's Roman Reigns. 

There's going to be a ""next guy"", because thats what the WWE knows. Focus all your show on that one guy......and then shove him down peoples throats. 

So, the majority of the year I don't watch. I watch the Rumble, Mania, and Summerslam. Sometimes I watch the building month, but not always. This year I didn't.

One guy works at a laundromat where he's 50% sleeping through his shifts. 100% of the time drunk. He also proposed to his girlfriend with a concert T-Shirt instead of with a ring. 

We also have a guy who's done so many drugs that I'm convinced he couldn't pass a drug test now......and I haven't even seen him in 20 years. For all I know he could have been completely sober and clean for the past 15 years, and STILL I think he would fail that drug test.

Then there's me. I have literally no no future ahead of me. At age 36 all of the supervisors in my job are younger then I am, and my co-workers/peers are straight out of, or still in high school. It's a job that has a little more honor then fast food, but less pay. I'm not a drug addict, but I am worried what the qualifications are for being an alcoholic, and if I qualify. If I do, I'd be right on the edge of it, and could very easily stop. It's not like I'm drinking every day, and it's only beer......but still. I've heard some definitions so strict as to say if you have one beer you're an alcoholic, which I think is bullshit. To me, being an alcoholic is something where you can't function without it.

NintendoSwitch,ffo52rk,t1_ffmq6o4,1580074264.0,"Yeah. I remember the attitude we had in the 90s. We made fun of Canada for existing. We were pretty blatent in our attitude of being lazy. Homer Simpson had an episode where he had a catch phrase of ""can't someone else do it?"" while running for political office, and it catches on. 

It was all pretty care free, and casual. Then BOOM!!! 9/11 and suddenly we're all walking on eggshells not to offend. Music went from limp bizkit telling you to suck his dick, to nickleback saying something so mild that literally nobody knows any lyrics.......it's just doctors office music. 

We used to have grossout comedy. I remember blood and boogers being more prevalent in our media. We even had a video game called boogerman. Then immediately after 9/11, everything felt more cookie cutter. Like everybody and everything played everything safe. 

2002-2010 was a decade of being careful, and safe.  And the kids that grew up in that decade never knew of the concept of having a bully at school, and you tell your teacher. The teacher asks you if he had a knife, you say no. They ask if your bully had a gun. You say no. Then the teacher asks ""So why didn't you kick his ass, pussy?"" 

The next day you DO kick his ass, because apperently nobody cares, and thats the end of it. The school calls your dad, and your dad is more angry then the school is. The school has to calm your dad down saying that you were in the right for kicking that other kids ass, and they were only calling as a formality. 

So then they suspend the other kid for instigating, and give you no punishment. At the end of the suspension you have your guard up, thinking he's going to come back at you. Instead he leaves you alone and never bullies you again. 

So now you solved your bully problem, and got a free pass at beating the shit out of someone. Which felt really really good. Two problems solved with zero consequence. Schools today would NEVER encourage a kid to fight their bully, and in an indirect way I feel like it's a result of our culture as a whole shifting after 9/11. Todays young adults were raised in a safe space environment their whole lives, and I think they view the idea of fighting to stand up for themselves as a bad thing. 

I don't think that part was an instant change, I think it's the result of one change affecting an entire generations lives, but the change was 9/11 ending the views we held in the 90s. 

The ONLY change I can think of that came of it for the better is the view towards gay people. In the 90s, it was socially acceptable to say something like ""thats gay"" as an insult. Somewhere around 2003 gay acceptance became more and more of a thing, to the point that now calling something gay as an insult feels very cringe, and like that person is a bad person."
