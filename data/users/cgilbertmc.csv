1. Take NOTHING personally.
2. Unless specifically directed otherwise, answer all questions AT MAXIMUM VOLUME.
3. Listen, listen, listen.
4. RAMP and Reversion happen and are not the end of the world. It means they see something redeemable.
5. Take lots of letter writing materials (paper, pens, stamps envelopes). Even more than is probably necessary, because some of your crewmates will not remember or not believe they need them.
6. Request your family and friends write a lot. It helps keep you connected and know they support you. Have them include news clippings, photos (especially of pets) and jokes.
7. Take NOTHING that is not specifically permitted.
8. Take extra long underwear and *wool* socks. Even if it is not a cold winter, these will save you much agony in even moderately cold weather.
9. If you have a gift for writing and/or photography, volunteer for company historian. It is interesting and you get the chance to use some of that ""extra"" time actively. It is also a nice diversion from the routine day-to-day.
10. Do not worry if you are being made an example of, even if you feel it is unjustified. The spotlight will pass to someone else. It happens all the time.

7. Take NOTHING that is not specifically permitted.
8. Take extra long underwear and *wool* socks. Even if it is not a cold winter, these will save you much agony in even moderately cold weather.
9. If you have a gift for writing and/or photography, volunteer for company historian. It is interesting and you get the chance to use some of that ""extra"" time actively. It is also a nice diversion from the routine day-to-day.
10. Do not worry if you are being made an example of, even if you feel it is unjustified. The spotlight will pass to someone else. It happens all the time.
11. Most important...see rule 1."

This is extraordinary only in the conditions and complete success of the operation. This is what the Coast Guard does every single day of the year. When any other service gets in the news, it is 90% of the time for killing someone or blowing something up. The Coast Guard rarely get in the news because it is expected to be the last line of succor to mariners, boaters and swimmers. Why is it more newsworthy to destroy than to save? Every year, Congress debates cutting the USCG budget, not because it is failing at its job, but because it is successful. The Polar Star is the last functional heavy icebreaker in the US inventory. It is 44 years old and literally falling apart, yet it is deployed every year to Antarctica to keep sea lanes open. The J-60 helicopters the CG flies are only optioned to them after the Navy has declared them no longer fit for service due to age. The CG then flies them 4X past their recommended lifetime and 2X past mandatory (by Sikorsky) decertification. When these Congressional clowns cannot figure out how to pay for the government to continue operations, the CG is regarded as critical in operation, but not for being paid (unlike DoD members).

Rant over.

Congratulations to USCGAS Sitka and Kodiak and all CG crews that help keep us safe."
