Our problem lies with state funded education pre-k through 12. The education environment of typical schools is very disruptive towards anyone taking their education seriously. Burnt out, low-end teachers don't help the problem either. But what do you expect them to hire? Too many kids failed their SoL's and now the school's funding got cut. Whoever it was that tied performance to funding priority should fucking keel over. I am so disgusted at our preparatory system - why is accounting not a mandatory class in public education? I'd much rather have learned practical skills than knowing that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. But no, I have to figure out on my own how to tithe some of my money away so the government can keep not fixing any of this.
