Magnesium is also a possibility for reducing glutamate excess if it is caused by nmda receptor overactivity.

Those people suffer and their suffering won't stop and they have the right to seek out relief. Believe me, there is pain that will make you rather want to die than to feel it any minute longer. I have also a pain intensification disorder and i only kept going because i found a treatment in time, i had given myself another year to keep going when i just wanted to die. I so much wanted to kill myself and had to hold back, but had it taken longer than that year i wouldn't have been able to live with this any much longer.

Not everything is curable/treatable/fixable in the nearest future. And for some this future is too far away. They deserve to have access to assisted suicide and not to be forced to suffer on.

I would still kill myself if i would have to go through another month of my pain. I reached my limits and i won't be able to take anymore. Even if you told me ""tolerate this painful month and afterwards you're pain free for life"" I'd rather die. So intense can pain be. And it would be torture to withhold relief from these people suffering it, even if the relief means death. If it's not you who suffers the agony, it is not your decision. Only they who suffer may decide.

What i went through 99% of people wouldn't tolerate for half a year or less. I've met enough that gave up way earlier. Do not take me as an example, I'm an exception and it's not a lucky thing. I remember all the pain and it doesn't ever slip my mind. It's ever present."
AskReddit,fe2pjsz,t1_fe1qzl3,1578841503.0,"Suicidiality can even solely be caused by neurotransmitter dysbalances. Look up kynurenic acid and suicidiality.

Source: all the papers on this and research, but also my anecdotal experience. I take a med that lowers those acids and as soon as i stop taking it i become suicidal again. As soon as i take it, after a few hours, it goes away. It's neurological and can affect any and everyone"
AskReddit,fe2p66r,t1_fe1hbqn,1578841353.0,"Yeah but have you tried to kill yourself? I tried hanging myself. It's awful. Society should provide people with the possibility of assisted suicide.

I do get not dragging innocent people into this, which is why i tried hanging. But hanging sucks and other methods that are called ""gruesome"" like shooting yourself would be quicker and less painful but not ok afterall because of the mess one leaves behind.


I'm just saying but don't stomp further on the ones who are already desperately driven into a corner and don't know what to do. You don't seem to understand what kind of agony is possible to be experienced, else you wouldn't write so ignorant about it. Have empathy and compassion and pity.

Don't be so cruel"
