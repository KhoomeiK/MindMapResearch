WTF,ff2tfge,t1_ff2rimr,1579523422.0,"Both sides of the road are two way, but for some reason the arrows switch on the other side of the gate. I asked a guy who lived there about it, and he had no idea either.
The other thing about it is that I’m in Australia, so we drive on the left. You do that on the other side of the gate in the picture, but once you leave the gated area you’re directed to drive on the right side of the road out to the street.

Edit - The road is two way on both sides of the gate, not ‘both sides of the road are two way’."

The dog’s known the koala for (I think they said) five months or more? Something like that. Ordinarily the koala would be in some danger because they apparently have quite thin skins and inquisitive/playful dogs can wound them easily."
