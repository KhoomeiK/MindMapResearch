I had loose skin removed in three places in October and had to take about five weeks off from the gym. It only took two to three weeks to get back to my usual stats and now I've surpassed them"
AskReddit,ff4thy2,t1_ff4qiey,1579572066.0,"I don't know. I once worked in a Starbucks years ago and a woman asked me how to get out. Like stone cold serious could not locate the exit door, and didn't seem in the slightest to be mentally delayed. Just a young adult woman. This was in lower Manhattan and we had a tiny Cafe so it wasn't like a monolith of a store. And how did she get in?!

After all of years of retail nothing surprises me"
AskReddit,ff1xh2d,t3_er51qa,1579488407.0,When two different medias play at once. Like sometimes at my gym I see my trainer in the music AND the TV is on at the same time. It feels like it causes interference in my brain
xxfitness,fep39ra,t1_feou2gh,1579311159.0,"This happens with my trainer. I start to really kick ass at something and then she adds something new to my repertoire and it throws me for a loop. I get moody and insecure that I can't do The Thing and she has to remind me that it takes practice to build up the muscle memory. A few sessions later, I can do The Thing and I enjoy it"
peopleofwalmart,feigb0r,t1_feifzrd,1579137857.0,"Why not? Everyone is capable of a caloric deficit. Weight loss is pretty much math. Unless she has an extreme health issue she can eat 5k calories less a day just as I can eat 500 calories less a day

That's any emotional trauma withstanding, but I'm not gonna speculate on that"
peopleofwalmart,feifmqe,t1_fei0iyw,1579137401.0,"The thing is, there's always a point of return. I was 400lbs by the time I was 18, and always overweight or obese up to that point. I was never confined to a motorized scooter but I wasn't that far off

Then one day something clicked in me and now I'm 165lbs. I run miles and work out 4-5 days a week, and I did it without weight loss surgery

There's always a chance to change, you just need to have the drive to do it"
GetMotivated,febpuxl,t1_febp7si,1578961383.0,Thanks! (I'm a woman but I'll take the man as a gender neutral term) (:
GetMotivated,febicrb,t1_feb1elx,1578959147.0,"It sounds tedious, but counting your calories and tracking your food intake is the only way I've been able to lose weight

I've lost 250lbs, or 60% if my body weight, without weight loss surgery"
fatlogic,fe3lcfo,t3_en8h4h,1578850316.0,"I was really craving an almond croissant today, so I told myself I could have one if I ran five miles first. It's unseasonably warm in NYC right now (66 degrees! 19c) so it was perfect weather to hit my first 5 mile run. My previous longest distance was a 5k

That croissant was delicious"
fatlogic,fe2lmft,t1_fe2kwr7,1578840042.0,"I had a consultation in NYC with a plastic surgeon regarding my loose skin following weight loss. I wanted my abdomen, breasts, and upper arms done. He said that he usually works on people who have more ""dramatic"" skin than mine and said he wouldn't go near the breasts. I was pissed. My friend came with me for emotional support and knew right away how upset I was when I came out

I went for a consultation in Atlanta (where I was planning on having the surgery anyway, since that's where my mom lived at the time) and it was like night and day. My surgeon had trained in NYC and said that the previous doctor was lying to me, just showing off

They ended up being the nicest people and did all three surgeries in one go"
fatlogic,fdvgen0,t1_fdvc8md,1578747147.0,"I ate more energy than I burned

It was a combination of things. I was always, always fat. Bad relationship with food, lack of knowledge, lack of activity. I'm always gonna have a bad relationship with food, I just have to try and keep it at bay

I lost it all naturally"

xxfitness,fdom6ib,t1_fdolptl,1578607969.0,"The only thing that has really changed is how often I lift (4-5 days a week, minimum one hour) . I still have the same fairly active Job (Starbucks)"

xxfitness,fdnu0gs,t3_em2vs2,1578592809.0,"Made it one day on a 1700kcal / day so I bumped it up to 1900

todayilearned,fdfe65p,t1_fdex4i4,1578359590.0,"I used myfitnesspal for several years but I prefer Cronometer now. The database in MFP has a lot user-generated entries which can vary wildly.

Also pair it with a cheap digital food scale so you can log your food accurately by the gram

I've lost 250lbs a lot of it by counting and logging calories"
xxfitness,fdcgmg1,t1_fdbp465,1578274407.0,"Mine was supposed to be a month, and now I've been using the same trainer for 4 years! Not at all expected but after years of morbid obesity it ended up being a great investment because I had fucked up my body more than I could ever have imagined. She's put a lot of work into making my body functional again - it took nearly three years for me just to achieve a flat back for deadlifts!

But YMMV. I have to sacrifice a lot to have a trainer"
