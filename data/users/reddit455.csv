By February 1942, American civilian automobile factories only made weapons and military vehicles.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanks_in_World_War_II#cite_note-life19420216-26) Automobile manufacturers such as [General Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors) and [Chrysler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler) used their experience with [mass production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production) to quickly build tanks. The country manufactured as many tanks in the first half of 1942 as in all of 1941, with 1,500 in May 1942 alone.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanks_in_World_War_II#cite_note-27) American production not only equipped its forces, but through [Lend Lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend_Lease) also supplied all the tank needs of the [free French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_French) (after 1942) and Chinese. By 1944 most British units were also equipped with US-built tanks. Finally, the US supplied over 8,000 tanks to the USSR, half of them the M4 Sherman. Similarly to the Soviet Union, the United States selected a few good basic designs and standardized on those models. Given the lack of tank design and production experience, it is remarkable that the United States designs were as good as they were.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanks_in_World_War_II#cite_note-FOOTNOTENess2002185%E2%80%93187-24)"

The resulting solidified spongy mass found in the victim’s chest bones is also unique among other archaeological sites and can be compared with victims of more recent historic events like the firebombing of Dresden and Hamburg in World War II, the article said.

Investigators explore how to heat, then cool the space oven in a manner that is safe for all crew member interaction. Any sample that is opened on orbit must also be crumb free. Samples are required to be sealed due to the potential risk of producing crumbs, considered Foreign Object Debris (FOD), which could cause unscheduled maintenance aboard the International Space Station (ISS). This payload operates internally aboard the ISS in a specially designed locker insert. The payload receives mechanical and electrical support from the Expedite the Processing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack. Once installed, the crew loads samples and initiates baking cycles. The oven heats to the specified temperature, at which point the crew loads samples for cooking. After a specified period, the crew removes the samples and stows them in the integrated cooling rack to cool. Once cool, the samples are removed from the rack for pictures and returned to the ground for analysis."

This payload operates internally aboard the ISS in a specially designed locker insert. The payload receives mechanical and electrical support from the Expedite the Processing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack. Once installed, the crew loads samples and initiates baking cycles. The oven heats to the specified temperature, at which point the crew loads samples for cooking.

## International distribution[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Film_distributor&action=edit&section=2)]

>If the distributor is handling an imported or [foreign film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_film), it may also be responsible for securing [dubbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)) or [subtitling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitling) for the film, and securing [censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship) or other legal or organizational ""approval"" for the exhibition of the film in the country/territory in which it does business, prior to approaching the exhibitors for booking. Depending on which studio that is distributing the film, the studio will either have offices around the world, by themselves or partnered with another studio, to distribute films in other countries. If a studio decides to partner with a native distributor, upon release both names will appear. The foreign distributor may license the film for a certain amount of time, but the studio will retain the copyright of the film. [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_distributor#cite_note-3) When a film is produced and distributed by an independent production company and independent distributor (meaning outside the studios), generally an international sales agent handles the licensing of international rights to the film. The international sales agent will find a local distributor in each individual international territory and license the exclusive rights to the film for a certain amount of time but in the same case as the studios described above, the production company will retain the copyright of the film. This means that this distributor in a certain territory has the exclusive right to exploit the film in various media (theatrical, TV, home entertainment, etc.) for a certain amount of time."
