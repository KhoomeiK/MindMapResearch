Also quite hard to say, pay varies wildly by location and state labor laws. My dad made enough to support a family of five alone, do all the things I described in my comment and still take two consecutive weeks off a year and rent a beach front house for us."

He had one of the first electric tooth brushes I’d ever seen, he is religious about his orthotics to avoid the repetitive stress of his natural gait and when a doc told him “your core keeps your back healthy” he took it as a sacred oath."

He would DIE if he knew someone thought this way about him because he only remembers his mistakes. He is by every measure and in every corner of his life, the best person I know. And a world class story teller."

Edit: there’s so much specialization within each trade too. My brother is state certified master welder who runs fab shops, you could specialize in medical gas, so many possibilities."
