Nice. I can finally get off 19.11.1

MechanicalKeyboards,femhzxz,t1_femhuf4,1579256564.0,It’s kinda confusing because I saw that there are either PCB or plate mounted switches. I’m looking to either use Kailh Burnt Oranges or Zealios tactiles.
MechanicalKeyboards,femhrco,t3_epu9y5,1579256201.0,Pretty stupid question because I’m a newbie but I want to do this to my Anne Pro 2. Does any switch work and does soldering the new ones on take a lot of work?

buildapc,fdp9u9x,t1_fdp3ku4,1578623365.0,Where’d you get that info? There’s actually a difference between 16gigs dual channel and single channel. Its obvious that there would be a difference between 8 and 16.
buildapc,fdnad4q,t1_fdn23wb,1578581443.0,That’s for a bios update. The chipset driver installation doesnt need that
buildapc,fdn1lmh,t1_fdn0z7k,1578574505.0,It should be okay. You could check it in Device Manager>System Devices
buildapc,fdn0ztp,t3_em94rw,1578573935.0,Make sure cable plugged into gpu.
buildapc,fdn0x0t,t3_em6w2w,1578573860.0,"If this is a purely web surfing machine, 4-8 would work. But judging by your build which included a 580, I would assume youre going to bebusing it for othe stuff as well like gaming. If thats the case, 16 would be the bare minimum."
buildapc,fdn0psn,t1_fdn0l3r,1578573666.0,"No worries. Dont take my word on this but if its new, it’s probably not up to date/installed. Just go on the amd site and look for chipset drivers for your mobo. Download, install and check on windows power plans."
buildapc,fdn0b66,t3_em8fjw,1578573265.0,I own a 3600. It’s pretty normal and the stock cooler is so-so. Mine usually sits at around 40 idle then jumps up to 50-55 for seconds at a time. Just adjust your fan curves to accomodate for your usual spikes ( i set mine at 20% until 75c when it jumps to 60%.) also download the latest chipset drivers and set it to ryzen balanced power once you do. It helped considerably.
buildapc,fdmzqof,t3_em8g8f,1578572696.0,"Just my two cents: i own an r5 3600 and you get miniscule gains from overclocking it and isnt worth deteriorating your cpu’s life. I tried overclocking mine (all cores at 4.1ghz, 1.3v) and I barely noticed any difference with the exception of a 20 point increase in cinebench. Just Undervolt it to about 1.25v and let it run at stock you’ll still get basically the same performance for lower temps."

residentevil,fck4rdt,t3_ehlpm7,1577716564.0,"6 flame rounds, 4 magnum rounds, a grenade and 2 flashbangs does the trick for me. Shoot him once when his arm appears in the ceiling, once when he gets in the room and you run out. Oonce you’ve presses the crane, throw a flashbang then flame round. Then either knife him or put magnum rounds in him. He shouls fall down. After, throw a grenade, flame round then flashbang. Then slap the crane. Then empty the remaining flame rounds. GeTting him to belw 50% hp is easy but timing the crane is pretty hard."
