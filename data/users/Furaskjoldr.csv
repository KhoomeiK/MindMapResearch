AskReddit,ffgyv6l,t3_etcyd6,1579918601.0,"Stop this idea that all men are just big stupid idiots that need to grow up and not complain about anything. 

I'm an EMT and a few years ago I was quite often working with a woman who was probably early fifties. She had this attitude that all men were just stupid and couldn't possibly look after themselves. 

So many patients who were men she'd say stuff to their wives like 'well we know what men are like'. If the guy was in pain she'd downplay it because she thought he was just putting it on. If I had a male patient I knew was in genuine pain I'd always ride in the back with him and make her drive because I knew she wouldn't give him enough pain relief. 

She was just so full of this attitude that men can't make their own decisions, couldn't possibly look after themselves, and exaggerate any problem they have. We went to a patient who we suspected had testicular torsion (look it up if you don't know what it is) and she didn't want to give him any pain relief and wanted to leave him at home. I told her that it was a condition that needed urgent hospital care or he could lose a testicle and she found it funny and made a joke about having two anyway. I also said that it's thought to be as painful as childbirth is and she told me that wasn't the case as childbirth is the most painful thing in the world (again, wrong). 

Used to really piss me off. Female patients she was absolutely great with - believed everything they said. Let them make their own decisions, gave suitable pain relief, and didn't make jokes to their family. Men were a completely different story."
AskReddit,ffghtv0,t1_ffgbzp6,1579906563.0,"Absolutely. It's like being born as a man just immediately makes you evil and misogynistic. I'm absolutely all for equality, but we don't get equality between genders by discriminating and punishing men. You should be building both genders up to be equal, not trying your hardest to crush men down to the point where we feel guilty just for existing."
dankmemes,ffg2701,t3_etcc38,1579896853.0,"God I remember playing War Thunder once on my old laptop and getting in a raging argument with a guy on my team that my Italian MC202 was faster than his BF109. We both got heated about it and then I started catching him up, same altitude but easily about 50kts faster than him. Just as I was about to overtake him and was already typing some 'I told you so' shit in the chat my laptop overheated and turned off."
AskReddit,ffg02qs,t1_fffyojd,1579895552.0,That sounds more like a migraine than anything more serious. If you get them a lot or they get worse or more frequent I'd see your doctor though. If you've had them your whole life it's likely nothing to worry about but if they're new or worse it's worth getting them checked.
AskReddit,ffeucxh,t1_ffeto7u,1579865919.0,How bad are they?
AskReddit,ffer5u9,t1_ffed7gk,1579861436.0,"Yep. Reddit seems so America-centric that the thought of foreigners having different opinions and experiences to them just *has* to be wrong. 

I've lived in Europe my whole life and never once had a problem with the police. All the ones I've met have been kind, professional, and reasonable. Heck, when I was in the UK a group of cops in a van gave me and a friend a lift home because he was really drunk and couldn't really walk.

When I was at university here in Norway I remember going up to two cops in the city and just mentioning I'd seen a girl a few streets back who was a bit drunk and on her own with a few guys hanging around nearby. Probably me being overly cautious but it just didn't sit right. 3 cops went straight over to her and waited with her for like 15 minutes while she called someone to come and pick her up.

I've never had a bad experience with the police here, and the only people I see moaning about them are the ones that are doing something wrong or have a problem with following laws."

AskReddit,ffeqx9a,t1_ffecmz1,1579861087.0,Yep been to a few of those. Think it's the extra blood pressure people create by straining so hard that does it.
AskReddit,ffeqwcu,t1_ffe2is9,1579861050.0,"To be fair I've been doing this job a few years now and seen it maybe 4 times. It's not super common and is more common in the elderly, or people who already suffer from high blood pressure."
AskReddit,ffequi7,t1_ffdoeyb,1579860978.0,"Viagra was actually invented to treat high blood pressure, it's a vasodilator. Viagra can be dangerous for people to have as it can drop blood pressure a bit, so if you've already got low blood pressure and then take Viagra it can cause you to faint. 

Fun fact - the actual drug in Viagra, sildenafil, is still sometimes used a medication in some parts of the world."
AskReddit,ffdh3xm,t1_ffdboa4,1579820734.0,"It's pretty normal to feel a bit light headed during an orgasm and after it (possibly due to a drop in blood pressure as your body relaxes post orgasm). It's also not uncommon to have muscle spasms during an orgasm as your body tenses up and your brain releases a whole bunch of signals at once.

However unconsciousness and spasticity (continuous muscle contraction) isn't normal during sex. I'd get it checked out by her doctor. Chances are it's nothing to worry about, but it's worth getting checked as it could be an indicator of another underlying condition."
AskReddit,ffcstdn,t1_ffcdwvm,1579806540.0,*In the US. You'll find it's completely different in Europe and Australasia.
AskReddit,ffcsegh,t1_ffclbic,1579806294.0,"Also, orgasm induced stroke/brain haemorrhage is pretty common. Quite a few men will have sex, finish, and then a very short time later have a stroke or a brain bleed.

HistoryMemes,ffcil8e,t1_ffbm97i,1579800237.0,"In Norway a lot of traditional Scandinavian names are around, especially in the North.

It actually used to be seen as rough and lower class to give your children English names. This is the why our chavs/gopniks are sometimes called 'Harrys', a few years ago working class parents would give their children English names (like Harry) and they got the reputation of being rough and delinquent."

UpliftingNews,ffcbw1c,t3_ess8d0,1579796104.0,"Lol you can tell Reddit really hates anyone with more money than them. The amount of hatred and negativity in this comment section is unbelievable. Not everyone with money has been given, some of these people have probably worked hard for their money and earnt it.

Edit: I spelt things wrong. English isn't my first language. I apologise for this."
nottheonion,ffcbkmx,t1_ffbtsm3,1579795906.0,"In my country banks have to call the police as a matter of policy if they think someone is being fraudulent, but also if they believe someone is getting exploited or there is otherwise suspicious behaviour. My grandmother once tried to take out a large amount of cash for Christmas gifts and they took her to a back room and called the police as the staff thought she was being exploited and was being forced to get the money to give to someone else."
AskReddit,ffbkj33,t1_ff9j89l,1579769698.0,"Was reading an article that says pugs are actually bred so much that for some of them at least, the problem is getting solved by their own genetics. Some pugs really struggle to breathe, and the effort of having sex makes them so out of breath that they eventually pass out."
HistoryMemes,ffbdntu,t1_ffaearc,1579760898.0,"Actually the Norwegian was chasing the British at the time and the British were fleeing. The Norwegian had a few cannonballs left but not many. He basically sent the message saying 'I know we've been chasing you down for a while now but we're actually out of ammo now, can we get some more lol'.

Like you say it was a good result for both sides. The Norwegians could keep their honour as they hadn't surrendered and had done everything to continue the fight, and the British got to keep their honour because they didn't shoot an unarmed ship that was unable to return fire."
todayilearned,ffa3phm,t3_esasvv,1579727268.0,"What makes it even funnier is that the Norwegian Captain was the one chasing the British ship, despite having no ammo. He was pretty much running after the Brits who were fleeing and then sent the envoy saying 'yeah by the way guys we actually don't have any ammo left to shoot you anyway'."
worldnews,ff908e5,t1_ff8tdts,1579701510.0,"Nowadays I think people's attitudes about littering are very different. Back in the 90s you'd see smashed glass bottles everywhere outside shops and restaurants. Nowadays is better. 

Also I live in a pretty rural place now with not much litter. I was referring more to cities I lived in when I was younger."
todayilearned,ff904oe,t1_ff8m576,1579701429.0,"Well yeah I'd agree with you there. My country is very much capitalist but we also have a lot of things nationalised and healthcare is one of them. It works well, but I wouldn't want every single thing to be state owned. That's going too much the other way."
todayilearned,ff8kvev,t1_ff8kjmy,1579683386.0,"What would you prefer? It's the best system we have at the moment.

I don't think there's any political systems where people's deaths aren't meaningless to the state. Why does the state care who dies and who lives?

Your death is meaningful to those close to you, and that's what matters, to me at least. I don't care if I matter to the government, I care if I matter to my family and friends.

Edit: I'm getting downvoted but noones actually provided a better alternative yet. Capitalism isn't perfect at all, but it's the best we've got at the moment."
todayilearned,ff8j6o0,t1_ff8iwgd,1579680947.0,"Those 5 things are also among the most common causes of death, so looking at those for survivability outcomes is a pretty effective measure. 

Obviously there are others, but looking at the most common causes of death is a good place to start."
todayilearned,ff8irem,t1_ff8i7ps,1579680370.0,"It's not good capitalism, it's poorly controlled capitalism where the people in charge are controlled by those with money. You need a strong government who isn't dictated by business, who can control what happens in their country."
todayilearned,ff8i6uc,t1_ff8i1aw,1579679613.0,"Should've rephrased that then.

English, Welsh and NI people have fees in the UK. The Scottish don't if they go to university in Scotland."
todayilearned,ff8i4ur,t1_ff83r36,1579679541.0,"As an EMT, even in a country with free healthcare, you shouldn't really take an ambulance for a broken arm. Emergency Ambulances here are supposed to be for life threatening emergencies only, if you've got a broken arm you should really take yourself to hospital if you can. Obviously if you've got no friends and family or money for a taxi then you've no choice, but ambulance services are crippled by non emergency jobs that don't require an ambulance. 

Plus, it'll probably be a ton faster. You'll be waiting hours for an ambulance if you only have a broken arm as the priority will be given to those with strokes, heart attacks, serious trauma etc (wait times are so long because ambulances are often out on calls where they're really no required)."
todayilearned,ff8hwyz,t1_ff8ea22,1579679254.0,"Thing is this is capitalism done poorly. Americans seem to think they're the only country in the world who is capitalist but it's really not true. Most countries in Europe are capitalist, but still manage to have free healthcare. My country is very much capitalist but we have national healthcare.

This isn't the fault of capitalism, it's the result of a few idiots with power to make poor decisions who frequently do so because nobody votes them out."
todayilearned,ff8h7oe,t1_ff8fq5c,1579678355.0,"Last point is completely wrong. If you look at this list the only thing the US has the best healthcare outcomes on is breast cancer, everything else they're way down the list. America is 19th when it comes to Cervical cancer.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_quality_of_healthcare

If you compare that and other lists for more ailments you see the best countries for healthcare outcomes are actually Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Scandinavian Countries."
todayilearned,ff8h1ju,t1_ff8f2c8,1579678136.0,Lol yeah hasn't US healthcare been fucked for a long long time? I don't think it's entirely Trump's fault that the US healthcare system is bad.
todayilearned,ff8gz6o,t1_ff8emim,1579678051.0,"In my country the debt isn't really like that as education is usually free, in the UK though they still have to pay 9000 a year for education and whatever accomodation they have on top of that. I was talking to a junior doctor from the UK who had close to 100k debt from studying at university for 7 years.

Edit: If you're Scottish and go to a university in Scotland you don't pay fees. Everyone else does."
worldnews,ff8g77f,t1_ff8ajzn,1579677062.0,"It probably is cheaper, but it's also true what they're saying. People like the plastic bottles for a variety of reasons so they will still keep making them. 

We might not like them, but we're not the entire population.

The plastic does have some bonuses too. I remember when the glass bottles were still common and you couldn't walk down a street in a city without stepping on smashed glass every few minutes, couldn't walk your dog anywhere. Plastic is also safer with young children around, and is easier and safer to transport in a bag or your car etc.

Also, plastic is actually easier to recycle than glass or the cans."
worldnews,ff8g129,t1_ff8ek5f,1579676856.0,"You can't just refuse to buy anything with plastic in it. I said this in another comment but I've been awake like an hour and used about ten things with single use plastic. My coffee comes in a plastic container, the milk for my cereal and the cereal itself. My shower gel, toothpaste and hair wax are all in single use plastic containers.

Plastic is such a part of modern society that it's impossible to just stop using it completely. Reducing your use is a much more realistic idea."
worldnews,ff8fwe0,t1_ff8doll,1579676701.0,Most Northern European countries have forced recycling and incentives to do so. Makes sense and works well. I get so confused by the all the Americans in this thread saying about drinking a bottle of coke and then it going in landfill lol.
worldnews,ff8ftn6,t1_ff8ddfm,1579676608.0,"I wonder if a lot of people in this thread even remember a few years ago when glass bottles were the norm...smashed glass on every street corner, couldn't walk your dog anywhere."
worldnews,ff8fkkh,t1_ff8cy8r,1579676308.0,Are they not where you're from? Here if you get caught littering or not recycling you get a heavy fine.
worldnews,ff8fi7r,t1_ff7z1xp,1579676231.0,"I mean economically viable or not what she said is still correct. We as a species do love and rely on single use plastic an insane amount and people do still want it to be used - maybe not you and me but we're not representative of the global population.

I've only been awake about an hour but I've already used single use plastics loads. The coffee I had came in a plastic container, the bag my cereal was in was plastic. Then I had a shower and my shower gel is in a plastic bottle, and my toothbrush and toothpaste tube are both plastic. The tub for my hair wax is plastic too. 

Way more than we first think is made of single use plastic, and people do like it as it's cheap and convenient. While we wouldn't mind paying extra for glass bottles, there's a huge part of the population who wouldn't want to pay more for Coke just because it came in a glass bottle.

Edit: Another point I forgot to add is that even with glass bottles a good amount of the packaging is plastic. When a product's on the shelf in a shop it's already been through a load of packaging to get there, and most products are covered in plastic wrap and put on to pallets (either plastic or wood). Just because we choose to buy a glass bottle it doesn't mean that product is good for the environment."
worldnews,ff8f8g4,t1_ff82tzd,1579675919.0,"I was thinking this...maybe in the US where there is limited recycling plastic bottles are single use, but in my country we recycle everything including coke bottles."

As you've said there's nothing wrong with being proud of where you first experienced all those things. It's that nostalgia most people have for childhood. 

Yes, in most circumstances people's countries will have things that people shouldn't be proud of. But there's nothing wrong with loving your home and the place that made you you. Also, the majority of countries also have great moments in their history, and things and people to be proud of."
gifs,fezjf8e,t1_feys5ri,1579457982.0,"You shouldn't, but Reddit wants you to. Have you read half the comments here? It makes you feel guilty for being born in the Western world. I didn't choose to be born in Europe any more than the people in the gif chose to have their lives, but the people in the comments are saying we should feel guilty for being born where we have. 

I hate the fact this equality exists in the world. It's horrible to see and maddening it still exists. But us being made to feel guilty for being born where we were is helping nobody. It doesn't help improve the life of those without, all it does is villify us for being born.

People with more should do stuff to help absolutely. If you want to villify someone for something, villify those wealthy people who do nothing to help those who are worse off."

I've been pagan for years now, but I don't hate Christianity. I've never had a bad experience with a Christian they've all been really nice and understanding.

I also liked that it was pretty realistic. There was no random friendships and deals of honour made between the two sides. When he told that German soldier to be quiet and the German soldier agreed to, and then instantly betrayed him when possible - I don't think there's many people in the world who wouldn't have acted the same way. The pilot that gets shot down and stabs the other guy? I think most people in that circumstance would also do the same thing. Also the main character not getting treated like a hero at the end, I liked that. It would've been really unrealistic for a bunch of officers to start applauding a Lance corporal just for delivering a message and doing his job. 

The cinematography was amazing too. The 'one shot' thing really makes it feel like you're there, and you're with the characters because you only see what they see and are following all the day."

From memory wool can be found quite cheaply in Ireland and Scotland, but the villages don't always have a lot of it as in locations with multiple factions they get raided a lot and are thus quite poor.

That's why Northvegr works so well. They're the only faction in the land and don't get invaded so their villages are wealthy and produce a lot of stuff."
mountandblade,feni8dd,t3_epq6do,1579285251.0,"You can make a shit load really easily trading materials. 

Go to Northvegr, docking in Tunsberg. Then go up the country going to every village and the lumber camp, and buy all the iron, tar, timber, soapstone, and furs you can. They're super cheap there, I've got soapstone for 33 gold before. 

Then sail straight to Bebbanburh and just sell it all to the traders. I was easily making 5k each time doing this and it's quick. 

After a little while of doing this the villages will end up with a fair bit of money. For a bit of extra cash you can buy ale or mead in Tunsberg and sell it to the villages for around 300 gold for one ale. 

To speed it up you can sell stuff directly to Tunsberg instead of Bebbanburh, but you make less money. Also it takes a day or two for the villages to have more produce, so by the time you've sailed back from Bebbanburh you're ready to go again but if you stay in Tunsberg you have to waste some time."
unitedkingdom,fel53q5,t1_fekztbj,1579214249.0,"Then surely you'll agree that the CPS do not require the victims phone to be examined in the vast majority of cases, and only those where it would be pivotal for the offence to be proven?

I agree about not knowing how they got hold of it. I fail to see what relevance seizing the victims phone would have in this case, and it really does seem like the defence clutching at straws desperately trying to find a way out - and trying to blame the victim is the route they've chosen to go down. 

I just hope a jury of common sense will realise how irrelevant it was he said he was 'going to cause trouble' and understand that that's a really really common saying, not just in the UK but also everywhere else. 

Fuck, I was working in the ambulance service in the UK and it would be pretty common for me to leave the station in the morning and say 'yeah let's go fuck shit up' like a movie character for comic affect.

A phone record wouldn't prove anything in this instance, the incident couldn't possibly have been premeditated as neither party had any knowledge of the other until they met. 

The defence are just clutching at straws trying their best to blame everyone else to get their client off. How they can live with themselves doing that is beyond me, they must have 0 moral compass. I get it's their job, but who could sleep at night after doing this all day and blaming the victim for someone attacking him with a machete.

OP you shouldn't have posted the exact BBC title. It's ridiculous clickbaity and innaccurate and whichever journalist wrote it should be fucking ashamed of themselves. 

I lived in the UK for a few years and it was super common for people to say stuff like 'right, I'm off to cause trouble.' or 'here comes trouble' when their mate/kids turn up. Hell, even in my language we tell people to 'be good' or 'not cause trouble' when they go off to do something. 

Also, I'd love to know on what authority the defence are looking at the victims phone? In a rape trial the defence don't go through the victims text messages to see if they 'provoked the attack', so why the fuck is it any different in this case? I can't think of any legitimate reason to read the victims text messages. 

Also how can they claim it's self defence? He jumped on the guy and hit him *in the head* multiple times with a machete. That's far beyond any self defence, especially considering the injuries the victim had (probably after even one strike). 

The UKs justice system is fucked beyond belief if this is what's happening, and it makes me glad I don't live there."

Also, all these are only in a public place. You can have a sword or a baseball bat with nails in your own house all you want or on private land, but can't walk down the street with one.

Worst was a guy who was 19 and at university. Got drunk with his friends and they came up with this game of jumping out of their first floor window into snow. This guy went to jump but somehow got stuck with a leg on the windowsill, so he ended up kinda hanging upside down outside the window for a second and then dropping straight down headfirst onto a concrete path directly under the window (not covered with snow).

We got to him and he was just a twisted wreck. Got him off to hospital and later found out he had broken his neck and back in multiple places and was currently paralysed from the neck down. That's the fastest I've seen someone go from uni student messing around with friends after a few beers to then being bedbound and requiring constant care.

The pilot that gets shot down and stabs the other guy? I think most people in that circumstance would also do the same thing.

Then sail straight to Bebbanburh and just sell it all to the traders. I was easily making 5k each time doing this and it's quick. 

After a little while of doing this the villages will end up with a fair bit of money. For a bit of extra cash you can buy ale or mead in Tunsberg and sell it to the villages for around 300 gold for one ale. 

To speed it up you can sell stuff directly to Tunsberg instead of Bebbanburh, but you make less money.

OP you shouldn't have posted the exact BBC title. It's ridiculous clickbaity and innaccurate and whichever journalist wrote it should be fucking ashamed of themselves.

Also, I'd love to know on what authority the defence are looking at the victims phone? In a rape trial the defence don't go through the victims text messages to see if they 'provoked the attack', so why the fuck is it any different in this case? I can't think of any legitimate reason to read the victims text messages. 

Also how can they claim it's self defence? He jumped on the guy and hit him *in the head* multiple times with a machete. That's far beyond any self defence, especially considering the injuries the victim had (probably after even one strike).

Also, all these are only in a public place. You can have a sword or a baseball bat with nails in your own house all you want or on private land, but can't walk down the street with one.

We got to him and he was just a twisted wreck. Got him off to hospital and later found out he had broken his neck and back in multiple places and was currently paralysed from the neck down.

I saw a comment on a post about the whole Trump/Iran issue from a redditor who said they supported Iran using 'classic terrorist tactics' against the US like car bombs, and it was fine if they called ahead before. Somehow this guy had thousands of upvotes. I've seen very similar extreme opinions about other things, it's like Reddit seems to hate violence or extremism, unless it's against a group or person they don't agree with, then it's absolutely fine."
