bipolar,fc6wqez,t3_egj05c,1577491467.0,"I know it's hard to let someone be when you care for them, but sometimes that's what you have to do. You can't fix him. BP2 is a part of him, and it will come back. Trying so hard will only leave you tired and frustrated. Stay in communication, and be there for him when he needs it, but don't try to push yourself into his depression or he'll likely withdraw further.

  


I know it sucks, and I'm sorry. If it's too much, it's best to tell him now so the two of you can walk away with minimal damage. But if you're willing to do this, you've got to be willing to deal with the ups and downs we go through. It will suck. But it won't always suck. Soon you'll have hypomania to look forward to :)

  


I do wish you two the best, though"

bipolar,fby45fw,t3_ef3nil,1577207646.0,"Depending on your style, there are two youtube channels that are very informative about what bipolar is, how it is to live with the disease, how to manage things, etc.

  


Polar Warriors is a good channel with a guy who speaks calmly and clearly about the issues: [https://youtu.be/Ln0EhLdr2lU](https://youtu.be/Ln0EhLdr2lU)

  


Lizzie Answers is also really good, and she has a ton of energy and passion, but not all her videos are bipolar specific: https://youtu.be/XMCToaisPDw"
