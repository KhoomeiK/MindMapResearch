Pet stores have an agenda to sell, sure some people might be good, but you can't count on someone trying to sell you something. It is likely this baby was sick when you first got him, you **can't** change that, even if you went to some high end breeder of dragons never assume all be fine. This baby needs veterinary care. To assess if he can be treated for his poor condition. For a small dragon they may want a fecal sample and maybe an x-ray to check for metabolic bone disease. I am sure he is too small and weak to give blood, that would be too much risk. Even a vet should explain what they are trying to sell to you and why they recommend it. You also should prepare to hear about end of life services. I'm only judging on one picture, I can't see the whole life of that baby, that one picture looks bad. I'm sorry.

As a vet he should be doing his job to guide you and anyone else working there to take care of this. It doesn't look infected, so the goal is to clear the pores to prevent problems. Big vet pet doctor should know all about how clogged pores (of any kind) can lead to an abscess if they are not resolved. In bearded dragons the worst case scenario are the clogged pores causing problems with elimination or mobility issues with the legs. You should be pissed at this jerk dismissing your more than valid concerns. 

Options other than water include food grade coconut oil, olive oil, or regular (no pain relief) Neosporin on the pores with a light toothbrush scrubbing. The extra plus way is to get an soft silicon brush - he could have suggested that over a toothbrush as it is more likely to sanitize the brush. This sounds like a store so this option should already be in place. They are often sold as baby sensory brushes, it's safe enough for human infants to clean and sanitize, it's more than good enough for an animal, they are cheap as well.

However if I was in a big city with so many more people I would be concerned walking at night, since there are clubs and people drunk or high on drugs, and more of a chance of bumping into another person especially since there is no chance I would know the person. 

It makes a difference walking at night in a town of less than 500 people, any house you do pass you know who lives there. There is more worry of crossing paths with a bear than a person depending on the time of year. Even now on the suburbs, I don't know all the neighbors, but I know a few.

BeardedDragons,fd9m42t,t1_fd8jq0a,1578235249.0,"I kept the regular light schedule for about a week when she started staying in her hide. Then I turn UVB all the way off and left a smaller 60 watt heat bulb on for 8 hour day cycles.

To me it seemed weird to completely turn off the fake sun. I didn't use CHE as her nighttime temp was 69°F and daytime in her cave went up to 74°F at the highest. She was in her cool side cave, I laid a probe thermometer inside to measure temps

For the next time I want to do the same with the lights. I don't think I'll wake her up for drinks so often, maybe every 30 days so she can get really solid sleep with less interruptions"
BeardedDragons,fd6nqxm,t1_fd61qpm,1578193547.0,I have heard this. The last 30 days I didn't bother her at all and that probably helped her rest to wake up. The 10 day wake up was my gets advice I took at first. Next time I don't plan to do that

I have to be that person and say that UVB coil bulb is not enough. It's so important for their health to get a high output UVB tube light. Reptisun and Arcadia are both good brands to pick. For a screen top you can probably use zip ties to attach the light on the inside of the screen. Maybe Reptisun T8 or T5 https://imgur.com/REw5JCL.jpg"

BeardedDragons,fd5ou70,t1_fd5lze1,1578179798.0,"It's her first brumating too. She was going for a world record or something

My vet wasn't concerned. We did fecal and x-ray before to make sure no parasites and nothing in her digestive system. I woke her up about every 10 days for water. Now she wants to bask and eat. Yay"
BeardedDragons,fd5mr84,t3_ek11qs,1578179154.0,My girl woke up from her 1st brumate. Just posted a pic celebrating. I've missed her like crazy. Wanted to support her instincts. She ate a few crickets and is basking now
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fd4c25g,t1_fd3nf0l,1578166271.0,"Someone had replied to you about them eating the participants, then deleted it. I think  we could go for eating supporters of the patriarchy.

BeardedDragons,fd0adx0,t3_ejoh8z,1578116002.0,"I don't think so. Even the pellet box should say it's not intended to be a main part of any diet for a dragon. It's also pretty high in protein, which a subadult and adult doesn't need once they are close to done growing. I share greens with my dragon and feeder insects to make the most for the money. Dark leafy greens like collard, turnip greens, mustard greens, endive, bok choy (and more). Then vegetables   like carrots and bell peppers and a small amount of fruits. We get a variety every week and the week to week menu changes a little for more variety.

There are supplement foods like bee pollen and dried flowers made for Bearded dragons. They add nutrients and are more stimulating than a pellet with good smells and tastes. I tried the bee pollen thought it tasted weird but my girl loves the bee pollen. It costs more than pellets up front but lasts a long time in my experience, a little goes a long way"
BeardedDragons,fd08n35,t3_ejole5,1578115272.0,"I don't think so. At most he may need a few days to get used to the new sound. Most dehumidifiers I've seen aren't that loud once they are running, only a clicking start up noise then low humming.

Do you have a water dish in his enclosure? I'd take it out at night to help keep humidity down, put back inside in the morning"
BeardedDragons,fd079nu,t3_ejrj2a,1578114692.0,"Glad you're doing your research! There are things like getting enough heat and high output UVB tube lights that are needed. Then when it comes to decorations it's more open to what you want to do. Some places to hide and climb are good.

 I like having a hammock, it's so typical to see people put in a hammock but it really is cute to watch them crawl onto their hammock and hang out, or sometimes sleep in the hammock. Something else on the left side, a climbing branch or hammock to fill in the space"
BeardedDragons,fd06eu2,t1_fcztonf,1578114319.0,"He's a baby. Preferably 3 meals a day, 15 minutes as many crickets as he can eat in that time. Put in dark leafy greens every day too. He won't eat them right away, better to start early, makes teaching them to eat greens daily as an adult easier.

BeardedDragons,fd05qhp,t3_ejpllo,1578114023.0,"It's more common for too much humidity. To answer, a water bowl in the enclosure can raise the humidity. Depending on your house humidity you might need to limit water left in the enclosure, like taking the water bowl out at night. I'm not against water bowls to be clear, give access to water

What is concerning is that tiny absolutely inadequate UVB coil bulb. It outputs a small amount of low UVB. It won't reach your dragon whole basking. Seriously, for his health, so he doesn't get Metabolic Bone Disease, upgrade his light ASAP. Either Reptisun T5 10.0 or Arcadia T5 12% are both great bulbs to use, the bulb needs a fixture with a reflector. Here is an example of how to position the light https://imgur.com/YfeycDX.jpg Please"

BeardedDragons,fd003vk,t3_ejkmw1,1578111607.0,"I can see you care about your dragon, but that lighting is not adequate for his health. If all your UVB is that some lamp coil bulb the UVB is limited to a very small area. It is hard to see, maybe there is more on the right side? I'm not sure...heat and high output UVB should be first thing on setting up an enclosure. I don't mean to rain on parade, I'm concerned for your guy's health

I went a little overboard with fatty insects feeding my dragon because she was underweight and sick with parasites when I first got her and we did her rehab (*edit I can't spell)"
