CBT,ffosssn,t3_euef3y,1580081272.0,"I think you should strive to make it a daily habit of doing the daily mood exercises rather than waiting for some period where you can stop doing it. Also don't forget that the behavioural aspect is also an integral way in defeating thoughts. For example the thought ""I'll be such a failure if I mess up this interview"" can be disputed using both the daily mood log and literally forcing yourself to do it and possibly failing and observing that it's not the end of the world.

I personally noticed immediate changes. I felt like I was on cloud nine in the beginning. But obviously that doesn't last. You simply have to keep after those negative thoughts. Remember you have practiced thinking a certain way your entire life."
CBT,ffd4l6w,t1_ffd1agu,1579813304.0,"But they're probably rooted in a core fear such as

socialanxiety,ffa5a12,t3_erzomb,1579728155.0,"You're not a ""retard"" because the term ""retard"" is itself meaningless (in the sense you're using). There is no such thing as a ""idiotic"" or ""retarded"" person.  That's merely an idea in your heads and other. Think about it. If you were truly idiotic, you'd basically be doomed to do everything thing (at least the important things) idiotiocally in life FOREVER. Of course people may have that thought about you but it doesn't even mean anything. 

You're a person that felt anxious and made an error (a social error). Everyone fucking human being makes errors. Furthermore because of your anxiety which you don't bring on your own exactly, you become more likely to make errors. You aren't to blame so don't be too hard on yourself."

socialanxiety,fesuajd,t3_eqgh65,1579369056.0,"Why not do a list of the things you can do (theoretically everything) with social anxiety and things that you can't do? My guess you'll find things that you can do

(1) Read

(2) Watch Films

(3) Travel and experience other countries

(4) Exercise

(5) Work

(6) Endless number of hobbies

Also you can very much overcome your social anxiety using CBT or REBT. Check out books by Albert Ellis and DAvid Burns. There is no certainy, but chances are extremely high that if you use it and push yourself despite your discomfort to socialize, you'll minimize it greatly."

perfectionism,fdnt5to,t3_eknc3b,1578592322.0,"(1) Name a human being that is literally perfect i.e. in everything they do they always do the right thing? Was Leonardi Da Vinci perfect in every single thing he did? In all aspects of life? He was in fact emotionally quite disturbed so in that respect he hardly was perfect. Were all of his works equally good?

(2) You're a fallible limited human being and won't be able to live up to this notion of perfect. So DEMANDING that you become it is negated by your own imperfection.

(3) Being perfect is not going to get you into heaven or mean that your life was worthier than other people's.  So why the demand to be perfect anyway? I believe this need to be a ""special"" human being, better than other's, is what fuels perfectionism."

CBT,fdg0nw9,t1_fdfzyag,1578375763.0,"What kept me going I guess was an understanding that it would get easier and I would keep improving. Also I had many pleasant experiences and rejection is not typically the way you picture in your head. Most of the time a girl will make an innocent lie up such as she has a boyfriend. Somtimes It would be hard to accept rejection particularly after we had been on dates but that's where the cognitive part helped greatly. 

My favorite books of his: 

A guide to rational living. 

how to control your anxiety before it controls you.

CBT,fdfyyru,t3_el3gjn,1578374204.0,"The underlying fear is that you'll give a crappy presentation and that'll make you no good. Challenge that instead because if you can see that in a rational fashion then you can handle anything.

""That was a poor speech. Might speechmaking ability might not be the best. What can I do to improve my speechmaking ability."" This will keep solution oriented

""That was such a poor speech. I'm a complete failure."" This will make you think that you're no good in all important area's and that you can't improve.

This is why I prefer REBT and Albert Ellis' books over CBT books because it goes deeper."
CBT,fdfy5gm,t1_fdfx5jd,1578373490.0,"I used to make the mistake of spending all my time on the cognitive element with the assumption that everything could be solved that way. But it can't. It wasn't until I took the plunge and risk rejection that I actually noticed myself changing in significant ways. You literally have to force yourself because it is always going to be uncomfortable doing it in the beginning. 

Have you read Albert Ellis' books? He founded REBT which came before CBT. It's pretty much the same thing. Anyways when he was 19 he approached 100 women in the botantical gardens in New York. He himself wrote how much time he spent beforehand showing himself cognitively how nothing awful would happen if he was rejected. But that did not work. It was not until he forced himself over and over again to approach women that he lost his social anxiety. He would say things to himself like ""If I die I die."" Another thing he did was to speak to the women immediately because that's the point when the anxiety is at its lowest. Take the plunge directly don't stand and reflect. 

Point is if the grandfather of CBT could not get rid of his fear of women simply using cognitive elements probably none of us can. 

I myself approached over a 100 women and was rejected like 90% of the time. It's safe to say that the first time was extraordinarly difficult. I was a virgin at the time and had barely spoken to women my entire life. You seem to be coming from a much more comfortable position that I had been in. 

You simply have to push your fucking as that is."
CBT,fdfrm3f,t1_fdfl8a6,1578368505.0,"\-You need to do real life exposure, and force yourself to talk these attractive women/men. As you do that, work on the thoughts that pop up in the situation. Sometimes, especially with thoughts that lead to anxiety,  you can't put the lie to the thoughts until you act against them.

\-Another thing to consider is that women that you find attractive are not their physical appearance just like you're not your job. That's just part of them. They consist of many different parts, good and bad just like you. Currently you're deifying them and viewing them as globally ""good""

\-out of curiousity since you're in a relationship why is this so important to you? Attractive women that is."

socialanxiety,fd0qqqq,t3_ejs2xv,1578122487.0,"What you're describing is your own self-hatred because of this aspect of you - your ethnicity. You look down on yourself because of your ethnicity, and are afraid I think of people looking down on your for it since that will confirm your hypothesis about yourself - that you're inferior because of your ethnicity. I think to overcome this you have to figure out for yourself why you're not inferior  because you're asian. I suggest you try CBT on your own. Get the book Feeling Good by David Burns - it will show you how to do it. CBT is based on the idea that your irrational beliefs is what causes emotions such as social anxiety. That book will teach you how to combat irrational beliefs such as ""I'm inferior/worthless because I'm X (asian, short, whatever)."

You're spewing nonsense now, and be careful when you do so, because people here might think it's true and thing that there's something inherently wrong with them. Social anxiety is caused by highly irrational automatic thinking, and can be overcome if you vigrously think and act against your irrational beliefs. A socially anxious person thinks its catastrophic if they're rejected or make a social error. They think they're worthless if people reject them. They think people are capable of determening whether they're okay or not okay people."
