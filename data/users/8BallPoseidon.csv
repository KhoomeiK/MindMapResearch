nba,ffnv3oo,t1_ffnuu1o,1580071250.0,You play like Brett Favre did after his dad died. 4 Touchdowns and an unreal moment in sports history. These are athletes. They need to play.
nba,ffntxyx,t1_ffntvh7,1580070780.0,Spurs game is looking on. Derozan would be a mess.

torontoraptors,ffbvsgm,t1_ffas1pz,1579784421.0,Comments like the one you are replying to aren't the issue. Its the bipolar nature of posts like this by the same people who spread hate on guys like Van Vleet or McCaw. Don't get too high or too low.

nba,fdp6bju,t1_fdoxjb3,1578621021.0,You have one good player and hes going to leave once you guys lose another eastern conference semi final in 6 games. Milwaukee will never be more than the team Giannis couldnt win with.
LivestreamFail,fczljfz,t1_fcylyp4,1578103860.0,I actually agree that supplements are like the makeup industry for men. Theyre unregulated trash filled with stuff you dont want in your body. Its an easy marketing play with garunteed profit. Smart business move but not the best choice for taking care of his viewers.

WTF,fcqwrzq,t3_ehvuhf,1577893398.0,As a global community we need to stop feeding money into governments that wont protect us and start helping eachother directly. Governments cant be trusted to help us help eachother. They flee'd with the lottery.
