I don't even think the weekend was over ( I picked it up on a Friday after school) I want to trade that s*** in to try to get something else that was out at the time and he wanted to give me $15 for it. I was like motherfuker you're literally selling it for $45 used on the shelf give me a fuckin break.

he started arguing with me and the kids behind me was like""  yo I'm actually here by the game I'll buy it off of you for thirty bucks."" well the manager was on the next register and he heard us.  he was like ""you can't sell stuff in our store."" I said ""okay"" and he told the kid to follow me outside.
