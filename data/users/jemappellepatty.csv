TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffdr30s,t3_et11ye,1579826874.0,"yeast infections are the absolute worst. I know one thing my doc told me to do bc I was getting recurrent ones was to go buy some cheap 100% cotton panties and THROW THEM OUT after you wear them once because the yeast infection is super difficult to wash out of fabric. it was hard for me to do bc it seems so wasteful but it did cut the cycle.

dont scratch! dont dig, dont pick or wiggle or wipe aggressively. it's so hard to not bc its itchy and burny and you want relief but you'll just make it feel worse. 

I would use a hot/cold gel pack and hold it on my crotch (over my pants) after heating it up for relief. when I could, I mean it's hard to do that at work. 

I dont have issues with monistat so unfortunately I cant help you there, I use the suppository and the cream and the anti-itch wipes with their formulary. 

I hope you get relief soon and never get another one again!!! yeast infections are the fuckin worst."

Do you have any continuing education resources for registered dietitians? Or have you considered doing any CE resources for RDs? 

My mother was recently diagnosed with ""spontaneous idiopathic anaphylaxis."" She's had a T.R.U.E. test that showed ""possible allergies"" to a slew of things such as blue dye, formaldehyde, and some things I can't pronounce (let alone spell). Her diagnosis also said something about ""possible hereditary,"" seeing as how I've been blessed with every bad health issue from both sides of my family, should I expect to come down with spontaneous idiopathic anaphylaxis? To me, that diagnosis seems difficult to pin down as ""hereditary"" but I'm not a doctor. 

How do you find a ""good"" allergist, versus the first allergist you've been referred to by your PCP? My mom has had esophageal/swallowing issues for 20+ years and random anaphylactic reactions terrify me. She's young (56 y/o) and relatively healthy, but when she gets sick it takes her out."

I used to nick the ""heat and serve"" Campbell's soups from work at the nursing home to keep on hand for sick days and mental health days but they started cracking down on theft (lol sorry for taking a couple 14 cent cans of soup)."

starbucks,ff3cv29,t1_ff2y90o,1579538615.0,"the only store I worked at that had signage like this was an indie coffee shop, and didn't think to schedule ""off floor"" time for writing up signs (which is a genius idea btw, so **that employee** can spend however much time they want on the signage).  super annoying too, when the owner/manager sees *this* stuff as a productive use of time and not the people who are actually doing work (like the aforementioned stocking, cleaning, etc.). 

I always get really angry when I see superfluous signage at basically any store. as if that wasn't obvious. like patty chill, it's just a sign. you dont work in coffee anymore. either buy the advertised whatever, or don't and move on."
