CasualConversation,ff97rw5,t1_ff97dvi,1579706821.0,"i agree. however, i don't think there really needs to be a mending between older generations and younger generations, as we can quite literally focus our effort on maintaining relations between generations with more close age gaps and letting older generations die out. 

ok boomer is a retort out of exasperation, but i don't anyones under the assumption that we want to lessen the divide between boomers and other gens. we're just making fun of them until they die out because of various problems that they created.

i will say tho within my generation specifically (gen z) there is already quarrel and disparagement that could potentially lead to the status quo existing in the future, which should be focused on more rather than mending."

so what we get from this is that OP at the minimum is looking for an LGBT friendly group.

ideally, the members of the group belong to the community. and even more ideally, the group does not have a cis-het male *majority*.

the last two parts are *preferences*. OP just wants to vibe with a group that would prolly sympathize with them more than presumably cis-het men would. but nowhere in that statement is OP **specifically** excluding cis men."
