explainlikeimfive,ff7gp3c,t1_ff7famm,1579649138.0,"As i understand it, the more substantial (massive, i believe but im not sure, could be size???) something is, the less uncertain we are. So for an electron (nearly but not quite massless) the uncertainty is high, especially compared to its size. For a baseball, the uncertainty is so low its meaningless - again compared to its size.

For an atom or individual proton, the answer lies somewhere in between.

Someone PLEASE correct me if im wrong."
funny,ff7f0ki,t1_ff7dy4c,1579648033.0,"I think you are right about decimal places, i just meant the words you used - and sorry to be a stickler meeseeks, but sqrt(2) is still not recursive. It is irrational, meaning the decimal goes ion forever and doesnt repeat.

Recursive is like if i tell you to start with a number x, then add another number y to it, and then to treat the answer of x+y as 'x' for the next step. For instance if i start with 1, and add 2, then divide by x (here, 1) i get 3. For the next step i take 3, add two and divide by x (now 3), totalling 5/3. For the next step i start with 5/3, add 2 (or 6/3), and divide by x (5/3), so we have 11/5.

Our recursive series is 1, 3, 5/3, 11/5.... etc

The way you get 0.333... out of 1/3 is another good example of a recursive process: 1/3 cant be done so we do 10/3= 3 remainder 1, which we cant divide by 3, so we divide 10/3 instead, moving us yet another decimal place smaller, etc forever"
funny,ff7cruq,t1_ff6ozk6,1579646544.0,"No, because you can get out a pencil and paper and prove to yourself with long division that 1/3 is 0.333 - at *some* point you will realize that you keep solving the same problem to get the next number with the same remainder and its Preeetty obvious that 1 divided by 3 is 0.333..."

Where ending in ""..."" indicates a recurring number:

0.999... x 10 = 9.999...

For the same reason 1/3 equals 0.333... : as you continue doing the same division repeatedly, you know you will always get a 3 next, so:

 1/3 x 10 = 3.333... not 3.333....0"
funny,ff7btgq,t1_ff7a2t4,1579645838.0,"Well, for one you are using recursion and recurring as forms of the same word, and i do not believe they are.

Recursion refers to something (such as an equation) acting on or referring to itself at a different point in the chain on a *recurring* basis.

Recurring means happening again and again.

You mention two of the top 5, because the other three are not known for charity. Nor is  anybody in the top 15, afaik.

The vast  majority of the worlds wealth is owned by people who use it to REDUCE the proportion of resources controlled by anyone else. Human nature is to be greedy, we evolved to gatheras much as possible for ourselves, in case of lean times.

The top 15 could lose half of their wealth and not notice a lifestyle change.

Your adoption work is great, although its not hard to read between the lines that you also use your energy to deny reproductive health services to poor women (rich women will never have to worry. They wll always have access). So maybe you should spend your money setting ip a world in which education is offered to all, negating the need for mass adoptions, reducing the occurence of abortion. Why dont you use it to create good social programs so parents dont work 90 a  week to pay for food and clothes. Why dont you use it for sex ed foe kids who dot have it?

You are obsessed with the baby angle because your church told you to be.

Now is that because the church wants to do good? Or is it because the church wants new believers? When were you indoctrinated as a baby?

Im not saying to stop HELPING people. 

Im saying make sure you arent being manipulated into thinking you are at a greater external cost than you realize.

Also, it shouldnt be optional to support single mothers. Surely you agree its our duty as a community. You agree so much you put your own money on it. So why arent we doing these things? Because if its optional, then the choice becomes ""be a good person or be competition for those who set up these rules.""
