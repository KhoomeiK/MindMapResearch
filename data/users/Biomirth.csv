I don't think this is like some clumsy accident. It is supposed to be dissonant. It is supposed to be 'WTF why are we soft jamming the sacrifice of people for power?'. Sometimes the way things 'work together' is to offer thematic contrasts and atonal parallels. Granted, this is not for everyone's tastes but personally I found it wonderful and hilarious in a kind of 'end of the world...all I can do is laugh' kind of way.

netflixwitcher,feclf9v,t1_febxzw4,1578976809.0,"The problem, from the showrunner's point of view, was that they both needed to introduce the elves and also make the episode feature Yennifer and Ciri in order to continue bringing the 'Epic' (later novels) into the present state of affairs. Maybe they should have made up a different story rather than refer to a short story, but it was a bit of a bind with no real solution. It was a pretty big blunder but considering how ambitious (by which I mean melding short stories with an epic ballad and wielding three timelines with not a hint of exposition) the retelling has been (of 3000 pages of story) I think I can forgive them.
