raisedbynarcissists,ffhithr,t3_etihdb,1579937186.0,"Okay op. I'm going to tell you some difficult stuff but I feel that you need to hear it. 

First of all, you are doing a lot of apologizing and rationalizing for your parents, which is completely understandable and is also a response to abuse. And this is absolutely abuse. Putting you in situations like this is extremely reckless and legally considered child endangerment. I am extremely concerned for your safety and heavily advise you to tell a school counselor at once. That brings me to my second point; you don't deserve this and thinking that you do is a sign of emotional injury from your abusive parents. 

You are a child. Your parents are in charge of keeping you safe and caring for you, which they are clearly not doing. Your parents (and I hesitate calling them that) are forcing you into extreme danger and then belittling you for being upset about your personal safety. This is not normal behavior. 

You do NOT deserve this, and you do NOT have to endure this. You DO deserve a safe home. You DO deserve someone who listens to you about things like this. Please, if you need to talk more, you can message me. I also think that talking to a professional would really help you undo some of the damage your N's have done. 

I wish you the best of luck with this and again, I'm always here if you want to talk."
AdviceAnimals,ffbjle7,t3_esbl5t,1579768366.0,"My religion is... complicated. I was raised in the church and everyone in my family was staunchly religious. My grandmother was a Nazarene minister. But I hate the church. It was nothing but judgement and pain for me. I hated always being excluded by the other kids and realized it was extremely hypocritical when I went to the private Nazarene University for a year. The admissions center had marble lamps and baby grand pianos but we didn't even have showers or a kitchen in the dorms that worked right. Only a few people cared about me there, and most of that was the students. I had a friend there that said it would either make me a zealot or an agnostic. He was right about the latter."

I would seriously check into your company policy to see if your managers went against that. I'd consider talking to HR about it because this reeks of compensation dodging. 

Dog bites like this should always be documented and animal control be involved, especially if you don't know the vaccine history of the dog. Dog bites always need immediate treatment as well due to chance of infection. Yet again, your work should cover it as it was on the clock and an occupational hazard."
