IdiotsInCars,fd2ik40,t1_fd2dc8m,1578147754.0,Most people are smart enough to use a truncated name knowing full well what the thing being named actually is. Obviously the slow lane is not the lane you go slow in. It's just the opposite of the fast lane which is for passing.

As an American I use ferenheit and celsius as well as metric and imperial almost daily. It's not hurting anyone, and implementing a change in measurement systems to 350 million people is an immense undertaking that frankly isn't worth it.

One benefit to ferenheit that I notice is because it's a tighter scale, it can be more descriptive without venturing into decimals. This makes it effective for weather reports. Of course it's inferior for science applications but scientists use celsius or kelvin anyway so whatever."
