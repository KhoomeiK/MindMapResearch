unpopularopinion,feg0wk8,t1_feft0av,1579072196.0,I was talking to a Canadian in the more rural parts and he mentioned how lucky the US was for having the electoral college because the overwhelming majority in the big cities outweigh the smaller places every time. That’s not right in any way especially if you stand by the “everyone’s voice matters” idea.
unpopularopinion,fefspkg,t1_fefc4m8,1579064047.0,Reddit and Twitter are exactly why a pure democracy and mob rule would hurt people more than anything.
unpopularopinion,fefslyi,t1_feetcrx,1579063964.0,I was hoping r/news r/worldnews r/politics would be good exposure to different things from around the world but it’s all the same thing all the time. Asking most of reddit as a whole to be unbiased is like asking a brick wall to make you dinner.
unpopularopinion,fefsdfh,t3_eop98k,1579063767.0,I just finished the episode of The Orville where they run into the planet completely based off of a rating system. Reddit is like a low tier version of that. Reddit is such an echo chamber I had to leave certain subs because it all devolves into name calling and mob attacks.

GuildWars,fdf9x0f,t3_ekz8kf,1578356726.0,I see I was not the only one with the right idea. I have been wanting to run Guild Wars as D&D but with so much I didn’t know where to start or what to include.

Needafriend,fc7wlry,t1_fc7w4v8,1577520558.0,"I like flipping through the books, something about the feel of it makes it just right, although the ease of access online can not be beaten. Been spending my free time writing up plot hooks and encounters for my upcoming campaign in a month."
Needafriend,fc7vq9b,t3_egiq1l,1577519895.0,D&D online? I personally have never tried that. Just recently started DMing at my table with my family. Don’t really have any friends where I live.

Meanwhile, we have Hollywood champagne socialist elites telling us how bad it is for rich people to not be giving up their wealth and letting in more poor people with open borders."
AskReddit,fc5h80r,t1_fc5gmqz,1577457515.0,Brought it on themselves with their “progressive” border policies that the EU is fond of. Poland and Turkey are catching shit for enforcing theirs.
AskReddit,fc5gvk0,t1_fc5g4ct,1577457239.0,Are they though? I thought their violent and sex crime is going up with unrestricted borders in the EU and an influx of Muslim refugees. Poland and Turkey are catching shit for enforcing theirs.

depression,fc4uomf,t1_fc4q1u4,1577429129.0,"I know how hard it is to feel like you are at fault. My friend and I knew each other since we met in third grade playing soccer. I knew he was struggling and when he came up to me I didn’t think too much of it until after it happened. I was going through my own stuff with depression and I was so caught up in my own strife I ignored his. The hardest thing I ever had to do was approach his mother by his graveside and tell her how sorry I was for having not been a good enough friend.


Your friend has passed away now. Let the grief run it’s course. When you feel like crying, let it out, man. I cried for a long time whenever I thought about him.


The only way your friend is truly gone now is when you don’t keep sticking it out for him and yourself. I try to take time off work to go visit my friend who is buried in California. I keep a small token with me and it helps to keep me from losing it all."
depression,fc4pphb,t1_fc4b0x7,1577423996.0,"I just try and push it aside while I go about my day. I practice bass, exercise, play with my kid, video games, board games, work. Just usual every day things, I try to be productive because it is easy to wallow and not get anything done."
depression,fc4l6ns,t3_eg21qu,1577419922.0,"One of my oldest friends took his own life almost ten years ago before graduation. Last thing he told me was to keep the family strong and to not give up. I live my life for three things: my kid, my promise to my friend, and the small bit of hope that somewhere someone will take all the pain away from me.


In all that you do, do not forget your friend and carry on for him, it’s the best any of us can do. I try and visit my friends grave every September."
depression,fc4kylz,t3_eg1njf,1577419726.0,Just started pickup up my bass and exercising again myself. Little steps every day.
depression,fc4kpl6,t3_efz27n,1577419511.0,"There is a phenomena that happens to the men in my culture where they die in there sleep around their 30’s or 40’s. Every time I wake up, I realize I didn’t win that lottery. I’m just tired, so sick and tired of the hassle of life."
depression,fc4kivw,t3_efv2fo,1577419349.0,"I feel the same way. In fact, I’d rather be alone right now than stuck in a loveless marriage with an emotionally manipulative adult child who uses our kid as leverage every chance she gets. There was love there at one point then I realized she didn’t want a big family, she didn’t want to be cooperative, she hates my family, and she hates me and puts me down because I’m not at her every beck and call.


All I want is a family and someone who loves me for me."
depression,fc4k4o7,t3_efukvu,1577419012.0,If my struggles or myself are not somehow the butt of my jokes then it’s gonna be someone else. More often than not it’s about me.
depression,fc4jueu,t3_efromy,1577418767.0,"One of the reasons I got off Facebook was the unhealthy obsessing over another person’s life events. Right now, I’d rather be alone yearning for love than stuck in a marriage and being lied to about being loved. It’s hard to love someone who hates you and makes you hate yourself.


Try and look on the bright side of things. Maybe pickup something new or go back to an old hobby you dropped to help forget the loneliness."
depression,fc4jfqp,t3_efyc5z,1577418420.0,"I used to run into the same problem. It stems from my need to have someone close - though not necessarily physical - to me and an overwhelming sense of loneliness. It’s why I got married in a haste only to realize I was not ready. Now my wife and I both hate me and lie to me constantly. Don’t make the same mistakes I did, don’t marry the first person you think is the answer to your problems.


Also, I have had the same crush on a girl from high school for like ten years. I often consider how things would be different had I been a different person then. So, no, you are not weird."
Dylann_Vox,fc48vp4,t3_eft4gq,1577409790.0,Absolutely phenomenal.
AskReddit,fc270az,t1_fc1ae8z,1577343315.0,Weird flex but okay. I vibe with that fam. Shit I feel old not know any of this slang stuff until now.

offmychest,fc10n3r,t1_fc0vc2l,1577304875.0,Do it soon. You’ll end up like me if you don’t. Stuck with someone and their family  because you’re in it for your kid.
offmychest,fc10j4t,t3_efjzy8,1577304787.0,"I feel you, man. I wish I didn’t marry an entitled, selfish woman. I thought we’d be able to meld our differences and family traditions into something new but all she wants is things done her way all the time. It’s hard to try and care or love someone who hates me and regrets everything about her life since me."
offmychest,fc103ji,t3_efbxze,1577304433.0,You are someone I would open my house to to enjoy the holiday with but my wife hates strangers in our home. I wish my wife was more open than she is.
depression,fc0zree,t3_efh9ma,1577304158.0,Holidays are all cash grabs and/guilt trips. They can all fuck right off.
depression,fc0zitw,t3_effy4l,1577303964.0,Exercise releases chemicals that help boost your mood but like everything it is only a small bandaid. I just picked up the bass and started exercising again and I have timers set daily to remind me to put in time for those things to help with my depression and to feel more productive.
depression,fc0z3op,t3_efelns,1577303621.0,An ex who lives you unconditionally is better than a wife who hates you and blames you for everything.
depression,fc0y9pu,t3_efd2x8,1577302949.0,I know how that feels. Two people from my parents church had nowhere to go so my family invited them to our get together. Wife flipped out so my family just went to their place and I headed over myself. I know what it is like to be alone this time of year so I am always accommodating with what I have. I’d much rather be alone.
depression,fc0y0ml,t1_fbzpmrd,1577302744.0,Wife and I had a big fallout last night and tonight. I don’t want to be home and I don’t really want to be around family either but with nowhere else to go family is better than being in a fake marriage with a wife who hates you and lies about loving you.
depression,fc0xr8m,t3_efhdh9,1577302535.0,I like it. The colors make it feel warm and hopeful.
TittyDrop,fbzu4xt,t3_efa1ym,1577261667.0,You can destroy me any day.
