Adirondacks,fffc7a8,t1_ffcjirg,1579880750.0,"Anything promoting or demoting candidates becomes problematic.  Additionally the definition of promoting candidates becomes problematic.  My suggestion would be to keep discussion centered around activity policy or political actions that directly and specifically effect the ADK.  Tax policy for all wouldn’t be appropriate but federal funding for an roads within the ADK would be appropriate.  

Finally your right this sub is rather apolitical.  Few if any posts cross the line, and most of us here want to keep it that way."
Guitar,ffeshg4,t3_et5vgz,1579863385.0,Literally ever SRV performance is amazing.  I’ve been listening to him for over two decades and still find new surprising details in every listen.  It’s hard to find performance.
Bass,ffe8q4m,t1_ffdwp9o,1579839773.0,"Thanx.  At one point in my youth o really wanted to be touring musician.  Looking back twenty years ago it’s a good thing that didn’t work out.  I’m too much a normcore geek for a rock and roll life style.  

How much hard partying versus professional (down to business) work do you see on tour?   It seems like hard party 70s and 80s have faded and rock music as a genre has become more professional (or corporate if you like that term)."

Guitar,ffcsg49,t3_eslo5d,1579806321.0,"When I bought my first guitar the sales associate played it for me.  I didn’t have clue he was shredded for two seconds, showed me the difference in pickups and amp features.  Cool dude made me feel good even through I was holding this foreign object in my hands.  A few months later I started what became four years of lessons with him.

Guitar,ffcqsk8,t3_esw4so,1579805313.0,"Follow the steps below for better tuning. 

1. Get a better tuner.  

2. Watch the YouTube video with James Taylor about tuning guitars.  

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V2xnXArjPts

. While using better tuner from step one, tune the open string then check the third fret.  The third fret will likely be sharp.  How sharp will depend on your specific guitar.  Find a happy medium between the third fret and the open string.  The open string might be slightly flat but that’s ok if about overall temperament.  This is how you back your way into the James Taylor tuning method. 
 
You can now tune guitar like a pro, good luck."
Guitar,ffcozry,t3_eswp91,1579804129.0,"Let’s take this unpopular opinion one step further:  tone doesn’t matter.  

Nobody cares about your tone, as long as it’s not ice pick in the ears piercing, or way too muddy. The only people that care or the bass player or the sound guy, and the only reason they care is so that you don’t mess up the mix.  Everyone else is just other guitarists trying to flex how much money they spent on gear.

Play better songs that’s what the audience cares about."

worshipleaders,ff4o55g,t3_elxnqw,1579568361.0,"I’ve been Considering changing up our set flow.  Normally we start uptempo, go to mid tempo and end slow.  However in the past that has been switched around.  Sometimes ending with a fast song is a good way of flowing into announcements with the “greet your neighbor” statement.  The former worship leader at my church would frequently end on a fast song.  It went well each time and just felt right.  

After a lot of thinking one thing I’m certain of is that set flow can be flexible.  This week I’m going to try to end fast."

worshipleaders,ff4mwq6,t3_erm3q6,1579567490.0,"I’m still using paper, filing and organizing is pain, but the batteries never run out.  A few years ago the pastor wanted the leader to switch to Onsong.  However some of the musicians and singers would still be on physical paper.  Which meant I would be responsible for both Onsong and paper.  My feeling was thats twice as much work.  Additionally numerous members of the team are not technically competent enough to handle a table or phone app so I would be responsible for their personnel devices during rehearsals. I would love to jump to Onsong but it’s just not in the cards for my team."
