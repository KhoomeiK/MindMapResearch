cats,fde8ait,t3_ekxgna,1578333369.0,"Have you recently moved something? A toy or furniture? You may have moved something out of place where they knew it was and now they can’t find it. 

Maybe more playtime?"
AskMen,fczqq6r,t3_ejpz86,1578106970.0,"Jack of all trades; master of none for 25 years of my life. Just recently decided to focus on one thing or area of things...and I have fucked shit up. To the point that I thought I was going to be fired because of what seemed like my own inability to be “good” at what I’ve now chosen to do. I have gotten better; after three years of hard work, frustration, tears, worry, blood, and sweat. I’m currently going back to school reimbursed by the same company I thought would fire me.  

It’s not wether you think you are good at something or not; it’s that you take the failures, the fuck ups, and the faceplants and learn from them. 

Most things aren’t easy and those people that make it look easy have probably put in a fair amount of time to get to that point.

You’ll get it, when you find what it is you want to to."

cats,fcqhqe1,t3_eihghr,1577886205.0,"Switch to a high sided litter box, we use clear storage totes as litter boxes. The high sides keep most of the litter in. This only works if your new kitty can get in the tote.

Can you entice your new kitty away from the litter box with food or a toy? If so try to make being out of that corner a positive experience. Keep in mind cats don’t like change, think of them like an 80 year old set in their ways so changes will take a little bit. Just try to keep things fun or rewarding for the kitty and don’t feel to bad because they are still getting used to the new environment."
cats,fc3udgh,t3_eg1tal,1577398865.0,"Does your cat have a “safe place”? By that I mean a place where they can go and no one bothers them; you, your S/O, friends, or visitors. It should be a place they feel comfortable and that they can retreat to if they feel threatened. The other thing that my wife and I are currently working to do is get the cats some perches that they can get to so they can be up off the floor and look down on what is going on and feel safe. Plus, the climbing is good exercise...even if it is to sleep.

Cat behavior can seem very odd since we can’t relate very easily because we aren’t as close to our instincts as they are. Try to take a step back, a deep breath, and really watch your cat. They may be trying to do something or want to go somewhere but can’t do it or get there, and that would frustrate them. Pay attention to the body language, where they are looking, and try to stay calm because they are probably just frustrated or anxious about something we just need to figure out what.

Check some of the youtube cat behavior videos, some are really good and you might see similar behavior with some possible solutions.

Don’t worry, if you put in some work I’m sure you’ll find a good solution for you and your feline friend."
