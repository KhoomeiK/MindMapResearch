Cooking,ff8tovm,t1_ff83cng,1579695706.0,"The cookbook is “A Year Full of Recipes”. No author, but the publisher is Parragon Books. It’s the edition from maybe 2-3 years ago? I haven’t made much from it verbatim; sometimes I’ll use it to get ideas when I don’t know what to get at the grocery because a lot of the recipes are pretty basic, like roast chicken or a pasta dish or things like that. I guess the publisher couldn’t actually come up with 365 good recipes!

I tried the sauce by itself before pouring it on and definitely thought it had a “unique” flavor but it wasn’t bad. I liked it enough to where I was intrigued. Then I poured it over and made myself a bowl and started eating. First bite, “Eh this is a little weird, not really what I imagined.” Second bite “I’m not super into this sauce but it’s ok.” Third bite, “Alright this really isn’t good.” Now I wish I had done pesto like you said!"

Cooking,ff7ni1s,t1_ff7mze2,1579653783.0,I think it would be fine with a different sauce. Maybe something more like an Alfredo would’ve been better. My mom bought me this cookbook a few years ago and it’s one of those “365 days of recipes” style cookbooks where the recipes change with the seasons. I’ve made some good stuff from it but there have definitely been some duds. There was a beef stew and herb dumplings recipe I made and the stew was pretty good but the dumplings were just awful.

Georgia,fe5wr8l,t3_envgwk,1578876670.0,"As others have said, you’re unlikely to be affected. But here’s some basic tornado safety for you: a tornado WATCH means the weather conditions are favorable for a tornado to form. A WARNING means a funnel cloud has been sighted. Now, this funnel cloud may stay up in the sky and never touch down to earth. If a tornado is sighted in your area (you may receive a text telling you to take cover or there may be tornado sirens, or you may just have to be paying attention to the news) go to a room on the lowest level of your home with no windows. Preferably an interior room. Stay put until there’s an all-clear, but tornados don’t last long. Average is like 10 minutes.

If it’s any consolation, I’ve lived here almost 30 years and have never experienced a tornado. I’ve been through a few warnings but none ever touched down."

I’m a medical coding consultant. The short explanation is that I work with hospitals to make sure the bills they send to insurance companies have the correct procedures on them. Basically I spend 9 hours a day reading medical records, operation reports, nursing notes, etc.

It is staggering to me to see how dramatically obesity affects SO many patients. Just yesterday I had a claim for a woman who needed a stent. The operative report literally said “due to her extreme obesity, we had difficulty locating her femoral artery”. In plain English, black and white, right there on the page, this woman’s fat was undeniably obstructing her ability to receive care.  How can FAs deny that fatness impedes health? She died. She was only 56. I see dozens of cases like this everyday. People who can’t receive proper care, or need to have their feet amputated, or their surgery becomes excessively complicated. And always in the op report it clearly states “due to the patient’s morbid obesity...” I just wish people understood what their fat is doing to them. It is literally killing them. I mean my mom is 56, I can’t imagine losing her right now. Jesus."

I’ve struggled with my weight my whole life and I’m definitely a bit of a self-diagnosed food addict. What helped me was to be more mindful of what I was eating. Paying attention to the taste and the texture, not shoveling stuff in my mouth while I stare at my phone or the tv, just really taking the time to appreciate what I’m eating. I started to notice how often I would eat something and suddenly find myself thinking “Wow, this actually isn’t even good.” I was just eating to eat. And then I started thinking, “If this isn’t even good, and I’m just going to feel bad about the calories later, why am I even eating this?” There were times when I would literally spit stuff out into the trash can.

dogs,fcl9cky,t3_ehrwee,1577742633.0,"For me, doing the fake high pitched cry only egged my dog on more, and redirecting to a toy really didn’t help. The only thing that really helped me with the biting was to put up a baby gate and go into “time out” whenever my dog nipped. (I lived in a small apartment that basically consisted of an open kitchen/living room, and a bedroom. I put the baby gate in the doorway to the bedroom.) When my puppy would bite I would say “No biting” and step over the gate and go into my room. My dog HATED being left alone. I would count to 10 then come back. If he bit again, then I would go back over the baby gate. This definitely got annoying fast, but it was the only effective thing I could do. 

Depending on the layout of your house, a baby gate may not be reasonable. You could instead stand up, cross your arms, turn your back to your puppy, and refuse to make eye contact for 10 seconds, then return to playing. Some puppies will just start going after your feet or jeans though, so YMMV."

It’s a fun little treat at the end of the day and it’s definitely not a large enough serving for me to get drunk or feel hungover the next day. I don’t think I would enjoy being hammered in the woods at night."
truechildfree,fca5rxm,t3_egrybi,1577563470.0,"In my experience, this sub tends to be more child-friendly than other subs. I don’t mind kids. They’re fun in doses. Everyone should feel comfortable to say they like kids but may not want their own. I like cats but I don’t want a cat. I think you’ll feel welcome here."

I used an exterior waterproof spray sealant (so basically spray paint) since it was a box, so I wanted to get all those nooks and crannies. If you’re coating a flat piece and using a paint brush, I don’t know what other people use"
