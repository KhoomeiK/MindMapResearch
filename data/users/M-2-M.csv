todayilearned,fgh4qmc,t3_ey7jw6,1580776656.0,What could go wrong ?
lego,fgh40v9,t1_fgfys8u,1580776173.0,Is Stud.io’s format documented ? My current prio is getting textures loaded correctly of LDD files
lego,fgh15d8,t1_fgfovx7,1580774221.0,Just holding the phone in a weird way. It’s difficult  to hold the phone in one hand and the camera in another.. lol
lego,fggypqt,t1_fggky2z,1580772575.0,You can play around with the same file I created and used in the video. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sttng/LDD/master/test01_Scene.usdz
lego,fggymdo,t1_fgg4pgy,1580772512.0,"Sure Sherlock... Here is the file. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sttng/LDD/master/test01_Scene.usdz
Try it out yourself on any recent iOS device."
renderman,fg1vdmg,t1_fg1uwrj,1580433769.0,No problem. In general renderman is easily to be confused (=crashes) with non-English file and pathnames. Suggest to remove those fonts (keep a backup !) and give it a try. Cheers !
renderman,fg1pt5k,t3_ewevxz,1580431450.0,"I expect you may have some fonts with non-English characters (é, ö, ã) installed? But did you also give pixars/ rendermans answerhub a try ? They are usually quick in answering."
lego,ffafvd2,t1_ff9phoj,1579734780.0,I will opensource it so people should be able to write converters for all kind of formats.
lego,ff8t2dw,t3_esauoi,1579695025.0,"I’m working to clean up the code (Python) and will release it as open source. It converts LEGO Digital Designer files to USD format (the latter being used by Apples ARKit).

Here is the exported file: https://github.com/sttng/LDD/raw/master/usd/test01_Scene.usdz"
DaystromInstitute,feq32xv,t1_fepw7p3,1579336906.0,If everyone is a billionaire no one is.
TomatoFTW,fe77ahz,t1_fe00p82,1578910985.0,In answering my own question. Got it working. https://exotic.se/freshtomato-arm/v2019/2019.4/K26ARM-NG/freshtomato-RT-AC68U_C1_E1-ARM_NG-2019.4-AIO-64K.zip was the firmware working for me.
TomatoFTW,fe00p82,t1_fdy5e6a,1578800259.0,The AC68u is listed there but not the C1 version. Or it doesn’t say which HW version
legostarwars,fdmqu9s,t3_em4wug,1578561265.0,Star Wars meets Indiana Jones. I’m all in !
science,fdmqqmv,t1_fdmq3rs,1578561122.0,This could be the exact problem. I guess micrographene is the micro plastic of the future.
todayilearned,fdg8371,t1_fdg13b5,1578383985.0,True. My fault.
todayilearned,fdfymgt,t3_el495u,1578373899.0,"Seems like a great cost saver !  Considering a $40,000 in 1987 is vaguely $90,000 in 2020. Taking their revenue from last year of $42,200,000,000 without this fantastic saving their revenue would only have been $42,199,910,000. Seems like a good thing !"
legostarwars,fdfnmew,t3_el23m2,1578365864.0,I still think this is the do far best iteration of the X-Wing
