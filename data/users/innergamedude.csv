He can treat everyone like an idiot because they literally are, compared to his completely fabricated unrealistic abilities.  Jerry has realistic and human limitations to his abilities, yet has the same ego as Rick and demands the same respect.  He takes pride in his utterly mediocre accomplishments like being a father and being able to set up a TV.  Only a fictional character can live up to the egos most of us have.  Yet here is everyone identifying as Rick.  Even this explanatory post, which to itself feels Rick-level smart, exceptional, and condescending to others, is just a Jerry propping himself up try to be more than he is."
