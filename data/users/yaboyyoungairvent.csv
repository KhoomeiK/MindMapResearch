nextfuckinglevel,ffbss9x,t1_ffbpfgd,1579781401.0,"Saying ""you can be some things you want to if you out your mind too it"" is harsher sounding then saying ""you can be anything you want to if you put your mind to it"". People don't like hearing things like that."

todayilearned,ff5z4nm,t1_ff5yan7,1579614864.0,"Vitamin b12 supplementation changed my life as well. Before it I was a lot more fatigued and tired. I was deficient in it pretty bad. If you're a vegetarian, vegan, have reccuring stomach issues, or tend not to eat a lot of meat or dairy you should get your b12 levels checked."

hiphopheads,fetn5in,t1_fetltvn,1579377080.0,The easiest way to get Kanye to change his mind on something is for everyone to like what he's doing. Don't people realize by now that Kanye lives to be contrarian? Doesn't matter what it is as long as it's going against the flow of what's expected of him.
GetMotivated,fet6eit,t1_fesqrw9,1579372196.0,"Really depends what job you're at and its ceiling. If you're currently at a job that pays 50k a year and you have no upward mobility it would make sense to go to school for 4 or so years for a job making 100k. You'd make your money back in 2 years of work. 

Now if you currently work at a job paying 75k+ it's a harder sell if those 4 years are worth it. But money isn't everything. If you dislike your current job then 4 years in school with limited income is most likely worth it for your happiness and sanity in the long run."
todayilearned,fes7zj6,t1_fervuby,1579362334.0,Weather plays a large part in mental health as well though. Many of the countries with lower sun rate and long harsh winters tend to have higher rates of depression and suicides even though some have better social bets and standards of living. When moving to a country you have to think what's right for you. Do you like socializing in person with friends all the time? Occasionaly meeting new people? Going to activities or hang out spots? These things are harder to do in harsh winter where many don't want to leave there home. A country may be better on paper and you may be debt free and money worry free there but it means not if the weather is making you depressed.
Blackfellas,felpw9m,t1_felo5ox,1579228053.0,I mean the actual job environment not the schooling or interview process. Then again not every job is the same. I'm just speaking from where I've been. I'm sure there are some IT jobs that are more relaxed.
Blackfellas,felpnlk,t1_felnopp,1579227887.0,No I don't wear any. Thanks for the reply. Appreciate it
Blackfellas,felnktm,t1_feko2lm,1579226457.0,It's a field I find that's not friendly period. Everyone always seems to be hyper competitive and looking ways to one up the other. You'll find good people for sure but the job atmosphere seems to always have a constant competitive undertone. If feels like you have to ALWAYS be doing something with code or you're going to fall off and be leagues behind. Its tiring if you're not passionate and eat sleep code like some people do.

TrinidadandTobago,fekarty,t1_fejygi1,1579196155.0,"You can still do those things but you just need to be cautious. There's still plenty of people liming around and hanging out outside. Realistically if you're not dabbling in gangs or drugs that significantly lowers any chance of you being involved in any violent crimes. Muggings usually happen after dark or in lonely places  (walking down a vacant street by yourself in a sketchy place ) so parties and events are fairly safe. I actually went to whole bunch of outside parties across the country over the christmas vacation and never felt unsafe.

Rising crime is actually a problem all over the Caribbean. I have family from Barbados and they've been telling me about some violent crimes occurring there I would never think would happen there in a million years since it was always so peaceful."
TrinidadandTobago,fej6ah5,t3_ep92ec,1579158640.0,"American here. Crime is pretty bad compared to most parts of first world countries. Compared to cities of Trinidad's size murder rate wise, the closest American equivalent would be living in Baltimore in the USA but the size of a small island. Baltimore's pop is about 620k with 354 murders recorded last year while Trinidad's pop is about 1.3m with a bit over 500 murders in 2018. Of course Baltimore's murder rate may be more on paper but I think when factoring in that many times killers are never found in Trinidad it brings on an atmosphere of heightened fear because murders can be committed openly and without care.

Though the crime is high, I don't think it's unsafe enough that you can't bring your kids and family. You just need to be smart about your surroundings. Use the same common sense as you would going into any shady areas in America or other first world country cities. Don't wear loud jewelry, don't brazenly walk with your expensive phone out, don't stay in areas with no working light, and etc."
TrinidadandTobago,fej47kl,t1_feio4zo,1579156269.0,"Trust me I'm not doubting what you say but I'm incredibly curious how all this happened to your family. I'm also an american and I moved to trinidad temporarily for university.  I've lived in really bad ghettos growing up (Detroit) in America with higher murder rates then some war zones and I've only seen one gun point robbery. In Trinidad I don't know anyone who has experienced anything like you're saying. I live in a upper middle class area btw.

I'm absolutely not rebutting that the crime is high in Trinidad but Is your family incredibly wealthy or something and they're well known to the public? Or do they live near a gang hot spot? That's really the only way I can fathom so much kidnappings and robberies happening to just one family."
