FossilHunting,ffa85on,t3_esbx9y,1579729753.0,"Hey dude, 
This is the guy you messaged today about ostracod fossils from CT on another website,
I would recommend you to do your own research on this stuff, I already gave you a key term which should significantly cut down your time searching for fossils if you look it up on the web and don't mind doing a bit of reading.
Most people are not going to tell you about fossil sites in CT due to them being fairly sparse.
My recommendations would be to do lots of reading about things like the shuttle meadow or east Berlin formations as well as what I already told you on the other site.
Make sure to know CT laws as they do differ from other states in terms of fossil hunting, also it's not just tracks here we have ostracods, plants and fishes from the Jurassic parts of which I have found.
Also you can PM me any questions you have, I may be able to help.

Good luck!"

PrehistoricLife,felar6e,t3_epkgbx,1579217801.0,"Inaccurate in both list and info, I did not watch the whole thing but skipped around a bit and here is what I can tell you,

I get you are going for diversity but many of the animals mentioned aren't even the largest in their niche, and they definitely do not compare to one another in size so I don't see how you can call this ""10 Largest Prehistoric Sea Monsters"" to me it seems like you just picked out the most famous examples of big predatory sea creatures and went with that, the only ones that aren't very well known are the orthoconic cephalopod and the ichthyosaur just because it was a fairly recent discovery.
Other than that you got a bit of information wrong, for example you state that mosasaurs are relatives of modern scaled animals like lizards and crocodiles yet all crocodilians are archosaurs and not closely related to these things at all. Another example is the dorsal fin of ichthyosaurs you say the large one is an exception yet if you look into the Triassic when these animals reached peak diversity many lacked that feature. Cameroceras is not an ancestor to most tentacled animals today as tentacles come in many groups of animals and modern ceohalopods did not descend directly from that animal, but likely a close relative of it.

Other than this the video is pretty good"
