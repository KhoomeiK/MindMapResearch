**Muslims**

Parts of Turkey, Syria, Israel, Palestine, and Jordan were invaded and conquered during the main crusades to the Middle East, and both Egypt and parts of Saudi Arabia were raided but not definitively conquered.

Spain and Portugal experienced several crusades during the Reconquista (and, in the case of Portugal, the Second Crusade). 

Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania were the subject of anti-Ottoman crusades in the 15th century. One *might* include anti-Ottoman campaigns in Hungary, Austria, and Slovakia in the 16th and 17th centuries but these were not formally declared crusades. 

Morocco was the subject of the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in 1578, and Ottoman holdings in Algiers, Tunis, and Libya were invaded by Spain during the 16th century, these were declared a crusade. Tunis was also invaded during the Eighth Crusade. 

One might also include Italy- there was an attempted crusade against the Ottoman beachhead in Otranto, but it did not fully materialist before the Ottomans withdrew. The Spanish conquest of the Americas also had many attributes of a crusade but were not formally declared to amount to one. 

**Eastern Orthodoxy**

Parts of Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Cyprus were conquered (often briefly) from the Byzantine Empire during the Fourth Crusade (and, in Cyprus, somewhat inadvertently during the Third).

Kievan Rus was targeted as part of the Northern Crusades, but those invasions reached only modern Russia and Belarus, not Kiev itself. 

**Pagans**

Poland, the Baltic States, Russia (Kaliningrad and parts of Karelia) and Finland were also targeted during the Northern Crusades. Germany was the site of the similar Wendish Crusade. 

**Heretics**

France, Bosnia, and Croatia were subject of crusades against the Cathars. The Czech Republic was the site of the Hussite Crusades. Parts of Italy and France were the the subject of the Waldensian Crusade.

**Political Opponents**

The Netherlands and Germany were the site of the the Drenther Crusade and the Stedinger Crusade, both against unpaying tenants of the Bishops of Utrecht and Bremen; Belgium the Despenser Crusade against supporters of the Avignon Papacy, Croatia targeted by the Venetians during the Fourth Crusade; Spain the Aragonese Crusade- arising from the Sicilian Vespers; and much of Italy during the Guelph-Ghilbelline conflict."

ukpolitics,ff96ppz,t1_ff94pzw,1579706135.0,"The two things that convinced me that there's basically no hope for improving public (or politician) attitudes to immigration for decades:

1. The polticians who demand the introduction of a PBS are currently running the PBS. The politicians who declare that we must never have a PBS introduced the PBS. Current policy, apparently wholly unaware of the existence of the PBS that they run, but very dissatisfied with the results of the PBS that they run, is to restart the PBS from scratch and carefully remake all the same mistakes again. Most of them are the same people responsible for making the mistakes in the first place, and also the people responsible for making the changes they now wish to undo to correct those mistakes.
2. The most generous lowering of the gates towards (in terms of specific proposals; not counting the vague or aspirational) immigration in any recent manifesto? UKIP, in 2015. While repealing certain protections for refugees and certain entitlement to benefits, and certainly having no such intention, it would broadly have extended current EU free movement rules to the entire planet. How could this happen? Because UKIPs members, policymakers, and voters were a) deeply interested in reducing immigration that they were the only party to suggest remaking the system from scratch rather than tinkering, but b) also so fundamentally had they underestimated the immigration system that what they genuinely believed was a much harsher threshold was, in reality, completely the opposite, to open the floodgates in a way no-one has ever proposed before or since."

To take a very specific example, there is no particularly good reason why, say, British Somaliland was amalgamated with Italian Somalia but British Somali East African and French Somaliland were not. The people who lived there were in favour of it, the powers that be shrugged. Or, similarly, it is arguably deeply unfair on much of its population that the vast area of the DRC is answerable to Kinshasa. No-one is suggestion that unanimity is necessary, only not irreconcilable conflct.

MapPorn,ff8y51i,t1_ff8wzxm,1579699830.0,"Yes and no. It is wholly fair to point to divide and rule policies as responsible for much of this mess, but do not entirely explain the conundrum of colonial boundaries; or at least, there are too many counter-examples to permit an explanation in terms of a systematic strategy.

Both, e.g. Bechuanaland/Botswana and Southern Rhodesia/Zimbabwe are highly ethnically homogenous. That could easily have been avoided had there been a specific intention to draw borders so as to avoid this, but were not, for, again, largely arbitrary reasons.

Certain borders were, entirely, arbitrary by any reasonable measure. The Gambia colony for example, was defined by the range of a naval cannon from the navigable portion of the River Gambia; or the British East Africa/Kenya colony by the most efficient railway route from the East African coast to the Mahdist state in Sudan.

That left little or no scope for consideration of the people who lived there, certainly not in any positive sense, of course, but it's also hard to explain it in terms of calculated malice either. The administrators responsible often simply didn't care- or even think- long enough for either. In fact, certainly with exceptions, the cruelty of the era (both in Africa and elsewhere) is generally better explained by decades of unflinching indifference than design, and for my money, that is arguably much worse."

I have a subtly different conspiracy theory.

Thus, there is, at a subconscious level, an association with Australia as being a difficult place to emigrate to; therefore, the idea that Australia has a tough immigration system worthy of emulation attracts much ready-made sympathy. In that context, the fact that the status-quo here is already significantly tougher is really neither here nor there. It's perception that counts."

ukpolitics,ff8m9xy,t1_ff8iufy,1579685539.0,"It doesn't get repeated often enough, but  [we've had a points based immigration system (for non-EEA economic migration) since 2009](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-6a-the-points-based-system). The system you're suggesting is analagous to the old Tier 1 (General) system, which operated from 2009  [until it was closed in 2014 for new entrants](https://workpermit.com/news/uk-immigration-announces-end-tier-1-general-visa-extensions-20140501), by Theresa May, for what it's worth.

It's recognised across the political spectrum (among those who have noticed it exists) to have been a catastrophic failure. In practice, most of the PBS has collapsed. Tier 1 (businesspeople) is dead in practice, Tier 2 (employees) is confined to extremely specific industries and countries in practice, Tier 3 (low-skilled) never opened, Tier 4 (students) is under enormous pressure (though in fairness working in some form) and Tier 5 (youth mobility) is novelty of little or no value.

It is true that the failure of the PBS *can* be partially attributed to serial incompetence (and malice) by those who ran it rather than anything inherent in a points based system in and of itself. A government which screams that it wants to introduce a points based system, and that it's outrageous we don't already have one, every election for a decade, during which it manages the existing points based system, does not exactly inspire confidence.

But to portray it solely as stupidity or dishonesty (though there is plenty) does miss a bigger point. The PBS failed because, in part, of tensions inherent in having a points based system at all.

With a broad and generous scheme of points, like the Canadian or Australian system, the system experiences far too high a rate of success, at least, in the government's view. The much mythologised Australian system would, by the government's priorities, probably be a disaster, as the  [foreign born population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population) of Australia (2015 figures) is around 33%; in Canada 22%, and in the UK, 13%. Once you have a system whereby someone who ticks the boxes is automatically admitted, and someone who doesn't is automatically excluded, this leaves no room for common sense.

The UK reacted by introducing a scheme of very stringent regulation, sometimes deteriorating into the incoherent, for example, in the Tier 1 system before it closed, a requirement whereby a business applicant had to provide a **landline** (not mobile) phone number for every client on every page of every piece of any written agreement ever entered into with them, or the application would be automatically refused. Do you have a landline? If not, anyone you deal with wasn't genuinely trading as far as the system was concerned. Even that didn't go far enough, so appeal rights were removed and the government conferred on itself the right to act unlawfully (see Immigration Act 2014). Even that didn't work, so the prices were increased drastically. Even that didn't work.

This had two effects, firstly excluding excellent prospective applicants (because no genuine business could ever meet such requirements and, even if it could, would be better placed elsewhere in the world) and encouraging mass applications by fraudsters- for only by gaming the system could you ever beat it and having no adequate system for dealing with them.

The whole ""points based"" system, at least in the UK, has been a failed experiment, driven more by paranoia than results. Could it work? Maybe, but we'd have to adjust to a much higher rate of migration globally. That's broadly been the Australian experience (at least), so the trumpet-blowing for this system by the government is odd at best and dishonest at worst.

Frankly, most changes to the management of economic migration since the 1980s has failed. Under the early incarnations of the rules under the Immigration Act 1971, a much more common-sense system was introduced. Does this person *seem* legit? If yes, give them a shot to prove themself. If not, get it reviewed, and see if someone else forms the same view. If so, tough; if not give them a shot."
