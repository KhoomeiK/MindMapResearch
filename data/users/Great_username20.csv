I had to get my dad to set up a counselling appointment for me because phone calls are a definite no go for me, then I never ended up going because the thought of telling everything to an adult I don't know at all scared me. Then I never told anybody I didn't go because then that'd make things 100x worse. It's also resulted in me missing doctors and dentist appointments regularly to the point I don't even go anymore.

To answer your question, I have no idea how to approach help so I'm sorry, but I hope you're able to get it eventually."
socialanxiety,ff6xctm,t3_erxc0u,1579636829.0,"I'm naturally a ground watcher, very rare I actually look up when I'm walking but I'm not clumsy. The worst is when you have someone walking toward you, when that happens I end up crossing the road even if my house is just a couple blocks down. Nothing worse than deciding who lets who get past the obnoxiously parked car first."
socialanxiety,fexvtq5,t1_fewewie,1579437286.0,"I mean, not all confident people are ignorant I coulda said it better. But ig there's confident and over confident and it's those over confidents I don't like. Think both our goals are to get more confident tbh 

Mine hits most when I'm out doing normal things like walking or waiting in line idk about you. Feeling like you're walking weird or not knowing how to stand and where to look and panicking because everybody's eyes on you. You can avoid things like meeting with people or phone calls but when you're out in public you can't really hide away and that's what i find hard. Hope you're able to find some kinda thing to cope with it like music or w/e because music really helps me especially when I'm walking, it's not as easy to control as some people think and anyone who says it's not real can just leave"

socialanxiety,fetdlat,t3_eqjwcs,1579374263.0,"I only give off a certain amount, i find it better keeping things in and I like to think I hide it well because nobody really asks me if I'm alright etc. It's prob more common not to share than to share"
socialanxiety,fesc49l,t3_eqgaf2,1579363737.0,"People say it gets better but does it really? They say talking helps but that's the prime fucking thing I can't do, talk.

I'm 19 too, I struggle talking to people I know, nevermind strangers. It's resorted in me missing doctors appointments, dentist appointments to the point where I never call back to make re-schedules so I just don't go. Of course I lie to my dad about going because he's the only parent I have left and I don't wanna stress him out, but I'm afraid he'll find out eventually.

I guess its a normal issue a lot of people have, I don't think we're pathetic even if other people think we are. I'd rather be like I am now over being an over confident ignorant person who doesn't get what it's like."
socialanxiety,fes8x4g,t3_eqhpov,1579362667.0,"I use my phone for everything other than calling. If someone calls me I just watch it til the call ends and continue what I'm doing.

Like even if a friend calls me, I fake an excuse as to why I can only text at that moment, not because I'm uncomfortable talking to friends, just everyone else in the room I'm in being able to hear me do it."
socialanxiety,fes7m4t,t3_eqgh65,1579362195.0,"I tend to only eat when I'm hungry which isn't often, everyone is so flustered about getting 3 meals a day and I don't see why if you're not hungry. I'm not unhealthy, i'm not ill, leave me alone.

I've got a job I don't particularly like, but I'll keep it since its what I know. I never had an interview since I was taken on straight from work experience, but I've grown to really start hating what I do and it's so repetitive and dull, but I physically cant say to anyone that I don't like it so I'll just tolerate it because its money every month that can sit in my bank and not be spent since I never go out.

I get what you mean though with it being a benefit, I see so many people my age saying they have no money all the time yet they're the ones on social media every night like ""drinks with the lads"" ""night out"" and here I am sitting here with 5 figures never being spent.

&#x200B;

Anyway good luck with everything and the therapy hope it helps"

Oh and then there's the joy of the absolute foghorn who blurts out ""why you goin red?"""
GriefSupport,fel7767,t1_fel24pr,1579215537.0,"No worries, I hope you can get through it as best you can. Just treasure any pics you have with her or of her, the first few weeks/months will feel so strange and literally everything will remind you of her but that's a good thing because it means you both had memories. People will probably underestimate how bad it actually feels, don't let anyone make you feel guilty for being down sometimes because unless they've lost someone this close themselves, they have no idea how it feels. All the best to you"
GriefSupport,fekjdw1,t3_epltky,1579201275.0,"It's hard. I'm 19 and lost my mum to a brain tumour in April last year. She'd battled with cancer since new year 2019 and I guess she kinda knew she was going since I was given a letter she'd written beforehand. She said to not think about any arguments or bad times we had & to just focus on the good times. Hopefully you both had many to remember too. I never got to see her before she died so I kinda get how you feel, the last I saw of her was on a bed with life support doing the breathing for her. Keeping busy is decent to keep your mind off it, I'm not the type of person to ever reach out for help or advice so that's always been my go to method to cope, but we all deal with things differently. Don't let things get on top of you like I do, you'll suffer from it and she wouldn't want that."
