Between 2005 and 2009 GM lost approximately $105B. The law allows them to claim those losses against profits made in the future. Again, this is the law in every modern country in the world. Denmark and Norway, extremely liberal countries, have tax loss carry-forward.

As of 2018, GM still has $8B in losses to book against their profit. Once they've booked that against profit, and if they continue to make money, they will once again start paying federal taxes.

So to summarize:

1. You keep conflating the bailout (a stock purchase) with taxes. They are totally different things.
2. This is standard behavior. Virtually [every country](https://www.dlapiperintelligence.com/goingglobal/tax/index.html?t=11-loss-utilization) has a model very similar to this.
3. You are ignoring the GM losses prior to 2010, which is literally the reason they aren't paying taxes right now.

Please, *please*, inform yourself rather than spread complete misinformation. It helps nobody to sell your idea that companies should pay more on easily refutable bullshit. It makes your entire position look weak."

Once again you’re an angry ass nobody that categorizes 10s of thousands as idiots because you’re angry that anyone could possibly be smarter than you.

It’s pathetic."

The head tax wasn’t popular. Labor unions opposed it, companies opposed it, and the majority of citizens opposed it. The controversial city counsel member that pushed for it wasn’t re-elected.

Please tell me how it was all the techbros? I bet they are all in unions, eh?

**EDIT**: Just looked at your comment history. Your entire history is just calling everyone brainless and uneducated. Nice."

Do you even fucking bother reading what you’re responding to?"

Exact same thing. GM is claiming it’s massive losses from thr bankruptcy era. It amazes me you’re getting upvoted. Seems redditors actually want to remain uninformed."

This is how it works in every other industrialized nation as well."

worldnews,fej6rli,t1_feitgwz,1579159225.0,What are you even talking about? Raising taxes on Amazon wouldn’t raise taxes on billionaires. Corporate and personal taxes aren’t the same thing. And I don’t even know what tax you’re actually speaking of.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fej5lzy,t1_fej4ko3,1579157829.0,"You need to do just a tiny bit of research dude. Corporations don’t “pay nothing”. It’s called a carry-forward and it covers previous year losses. Every industrialized nation in the world does, including tax-heavy countries like the U.K."
