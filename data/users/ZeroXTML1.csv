I’ve always kept it short, even when I was younger, less fuss that way. I was basically razoring it every week in the first pic.  Now I let it grow out a couple weeks. 

No doubt someone is wondering, “why pay all that money for hair transplant if you’re just gonna keep your hair short anyway?” Well honestly I thought the same thing back when I was younger. My dads bald, grandfathers on both sides of family bald I knew I didn’t have a chance. I figured “hell I always shave it anyway, when I start losing it I probably won’t care” but to me, there’s a big difference between having that short stubble there and having *nothing* there, and I didn’t realize it till I had nothing there"
agedlikewine,ffrxwl1,t1_ffrx9dp,1580168397.0,"Unfortunately yes. One session was enough to give me back a hairline though. I think the limit is 5 sessions total or something. There’s only so much they can take from the back before it starts looking weird. And it depends on where you want it done. If you’re only balding in front or back, it’s an easy decision. If you’re balding all over, it’ll for sure be a multiple session thing for you if you want a full head of hair again. I’ve always kept my hair short even before I started losing it so, for me, it was worth it especially since it’s a permanent solution. If it was the type of thing you needed touched up every couple years or was merely a stop gap, I’d for sure be going the straight razor route instead"

Then they literally just put the new hair follicles in the holes they poked. Sounds more grisly than it is, I wasn’t really in any discomfort before or after. Whole thing took about 8 hours (with a break) and yeah it’s expensive, about $10k, and since it’s cosmetic pretty much no insurance will cover it. Once it’s done though you have hair follicles that won’t fall out, they grow in like normal hair. I think limit is 2000 Graft’s per session"

FOH bitching about something, a spat between two cooks, someone walked out/no showed, a cook got sick again and I gotta go in and cover etc it got to the point where I’d honest to god cringe whenever my phone went off and I’d have this “fuck sake *what now?*” feeling. But Desi was a dude that was never any problem. I worked with him to make sure he had the days off he needed, and got the hours he needed. He was someone that, barring a serious illness, could be counted on to show up and work like hell when you scheduled him to, no complaints, no drama, just a great dude. It sounds like a “duh” thing to say but whenever everything else seems to be falling apart, having even one dude that you can depend on, man, it made everything a little better. I always did everything I could to make sure that dude was taken care of.
