funny,ff5kn8d,t1_ff56z54,1579597446.0,"I don’t know where you’re from, but I can tell you that as a Swede - to whom Mumintrollen represents the archetypal example of the widely considered silly-sounding dialect of Finland’s Swedish-speaking minority - I find this absolutely hilarious."
AskReddit,fex4zie,t1_fevr32c,1579424472.0,"Judging by your username, I’m guessing you’re a woman. Even if you’re not, you guys clearly had a female roommate involved enough to supply footwear for the endeavor. 

So, I guess my question is... why didn’t one of the ladies pose for the pictures? Wouldn’t that have decreased the likelihood of the bluff being exposed? And saved you all the hassle of shaving the guy’s feet?"
pics,feqgm4v,t1_feqflen,1579341622.0,"Finns are ethnically and linguistically distinct, although they are culturally and politically part of the Nordic sphere due to Finland having been a Swedish province for hundreds of years. 

Also, “Seluska” sounds more Slavic than Finnish."
pics,feqbfij,t1_feqagl4,1579339780.0,"As a Swede, I’m well aware. But I thought xenophobes typically venerated their own ancestral rights to their fatherland and all that bullshit. This guy seems to have some identity issues."
pics,feq858d,t1_fenwle8,1579338711.0,I find I’d rather interesting that “Seppo Seluska” is not a Nordic name.
videos,femkkvq,t3_epndzo,1579260239.0,"I feel like we need to get our shit together before jolly old Sir David finally snaps and turns to the dark side, and Darth Attenborough turns his immense power and majesty against us."
funny,fejyorm,t3_ephywa,1579188854.0,Horses are not well known for possessing large or even medium quantities of chill.
pics,fejhngs,t3_epflhv,1579174677.0,"I bet there are all sorts of adverse effects of heavy rainfall on newly scorched earth, though. I can imagine that a lot of soil might wash away much easier with less vegetation to tie it together, for instance."
YouShouldKnow,fejh080,t1_feixwrv,1579173830.0,"No, you should totally do it."
fantasywriters,fegczfa,t3_eoyj8n,1579088208.0,Sounds like you should look at how Star Wars handles these things.
todayilearned,fegcslg,t1_fegagcy,1579087977.0,"Dude, this whole scene is about grammar, not spelling. A for effort, though.

I really wish I could use red text on mobile."
AskReddit,fegc8s8,t1_fef8agm,1579087295.0,"You should photoshop a picture with a green sky and send it to those childhood friends out of the green, even if you’ve lost contact with them. *Especially* if you’ve lost contact."
todayilearned,fefyls3,t3_eosgcx,1579069630.0,"Gustav III is one of the few Swedish kings to have been assassinated. Today, the Swedish people is among the biggest consumers of coffee in the world.

These two facts are likely entirely unrelated."
todayilearned,fe7ktjr,t1_fe61rmp,1578915919.0,"If anyone’s interested in badass Viking names, I can add that *hammarskjöld* literally means “hammer-shield”. These sorts of names are historically associated with the old noble class, and were often mirrored in the noble houses’ crests. Likely Dag Hammarskjöld’s medieval ancestors went to war carrying shields emblazoned with the image of a hammer."
movies,fe1txs4,t1_fe1qphd,1578830782.0,"I like to think they’re several generations of eerily similar-looking soldier/scientists. Martian Matt was one of the grandkids who accompanied Pvt Matt Ryan to Arlington, and his son eventually grew up to be Interstellar Matt."
movies,fe0ynam,t1_fe0xggy,1578820393.0,Change “NASA” to “the US government” and it fits *Saving Private Ryan* as well.
AskReddit,fdwn5lj,t1_fdwn1dv,1578760378.0,"I guess. I just never liked it, personally."
AskReddit,fdv19wf,t1_fduj93n,1578741932.0,"I’m replaying it right now. A remake with modern graphics is a wet dream. The only major changes I would make is to revamp the combat system to be more hands-on, add more customization option, and give Revan a voice. Pretty much just port over the improvements BioWare made throughout the Mass Effect trilogy (which is also in my top 5 of all time)."
todayilearned,fduxx8z,t1_fdszjj0,1578740780.0,"*Tvättbjörn* in Swedish, as well."

movies,fddb7nd,t3_ekotjq,1578303660.0,"There is a shitty historical fantasy film called [*Season of the Witch*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479997/), were Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman plays two Knight Templar deserters who are tasked (by the one and only sir Christopher Lee!) with transporting a witch to a monastery for a ritual to end the Black Plague. I always thought it had plenty of potential for a satisfying, dramatic ending - which is completely thrown out the window in favor of CGI monster slaying. I’d love to reshoot the ending and change it so that the supernatural elements are still ambiguous and the conflict is between reason and superstition."
funny,fcx3iam,t3_ejbyb2,1578049620.0,This dog says what we’re all thinking.
AskReddit,fcunvqi,t3_eixc75,1577984987.0,"I matched with a girl with similar interests, we met up and I lost my virginity at age 27. But we didn’t quite click, and she met someone else within a few months. We stayed friends, which is great - but that was 4 years ago and I haven’t met anyone else, before or since, who has felt that I warrant a second date. I’ll get a match every 6 months or so, but typically they stop responding after a few days."

aww,fcndvkp,t3_ei2r2p,1577809649.0,I wish there had been at least one scene of Geralt doing this.
fantasywriters,fcl7aow,t3_ehs0ta,1577741353.0,"Not at all specific to the fantasy genre, but I am sick and tired of high-stakes, fate-of-the-universe scenarios. The first time I read the Witcher short stories, I went into it really hoping they were a collection of freak of the week monster hunt tales.
Why is slice of life-stories so rare in the fantastical genres?"
todayilearned,fcl6a9p,t3_ehno11,1577740726.0,"“Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.”

Old Ben was actually correct all this time - they’re not accurate, but they sure are precise."
AskReddit,fc80a2p,t3_ego30y,1577523423.0,*Antonio Banderas would like to know your location*
aww,fc802mm,t1_fc768dj,1577523258.0,That’s nothing. Try being four years older and yet having shittier facial hair...
aww,fc7y271,t1_fc7m8th,1577521681.0,"I don’t think dogs are supposed to eat citrus fruits either. Most mammals produce vitamin C natively in their bodies and will avoid foods rich in it. Humans don’t, because we evolved in an environment where vitamin C-rich fruits where part of the diet. We need vitamin C from an external source; dogs don’t."
gaming,fbw10s3,t3_eelpvf,1577138977.0,"If this is true, I would much prefer to play as *a* witcher, rather than *the* Witcher. Geralt’s story is nicely wrapped up; surely there is great potential to explore entirely unrelated narratives and time periods within the Witcher universe?"
