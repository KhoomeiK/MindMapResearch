bisexualadults,fekfwat,t3_epjklg,1579199194.0,"I've always wondered if I'm bi or not. I'm 28F but started to think girls were attractive at around 13. I've tried to have a relationship with a woman but none have any interest. Plus I've only ever been with(and currently in a relationship with) a man, and it's a committed one, so I'll probably never have the opportunity."

She was diagnosed with breast cancer and refused treatment. We thought she had more time than this, but my grandma says that she thinks my aunt willed herself to die. During my grandma's last visit with her(she visited weekly) that's what my aunt kept saying, about how much she wants to go. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm feeling the same pain, friend."

SuicideWatch,fdjd7qr,t3_elj3qm,1578466014.0,"I often resent my mom for not keeping her abortion appointment she made to appease my bio dad and his family. I know how you feel. I've tried to kill myself a few, and once was accidental(ironically), that one almost killed me. My ex bf(who had emt training) told me that my breathing was very slow and had he not acted when he did, I wouldve finally succeeded. And later that week, I lost my dream job. I wished I would've just went off that day and died. Nothing has gotten ""better "". I'm sorry that you feel this pain too. I wish it on nobody."

I was 16, my brother and cousin were about 2 and 3. Cousins sister came a month to the day after our grandpa passed away. He passed from pancreatic cancer, and while the experience destroyed me, I have to tell my brother and cousins( 3 more grandchildren came after his death) about what a great man he was."
