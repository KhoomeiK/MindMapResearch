YouShouldKnow,fff4kcq,t1_fff3xnf,1579875530.0,"Since you said “on air” I’m guessing you mean TV news? That’s great for them and I’m happy to hear that. But the pillar of news isn’t TV, it’s the newspaper. TV news tend to be more entertaining, which means they’ll sell more ads which means they’ll do better. Newspapers tend to be less about entertainment and more about investigative reporting which needs more time and often also more (human) resources. A lot of TV news stories actually build on reports that were published by newspapers first. Try to pay attention to this next time you’re watching TV news, how often their serious stories start with “According to a new report by the [Insert Newspaper]...” And those are unfortunately [undeniably in crisis](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/local-news-is-dying-and-americans-have-no-idea/585772/).

Another thing to consider is this: If your father hands out the money to your sister in installments like your grandmother asked, she should be learning how to manage it better. Itâ€™s maybe not as strong of a lesson as letting her find a job but it would already be a big lesson in budgeting.

Because they were funny we were always joking around with them and kinda pulling pranks on eachother. For example if one of them asked to copy our homework weâ€™d give them a wrong version on purpose so theyâ€™d read that in front of the class and we would all laugh about it. None of us were part of the â€œcool kidsâ€. All of us were equally uncool and equally nerdy. It seemed to me like we all thought it was hilarious, the two funny guys included. At no point did any of them complain about the jokes and the pranks. 

It was only 10+ years later that I found out that one of them took the jokes and pranks really hard and felt like we were bullying him. I had absolutely no idea at all and I obviously feel horrible about it. 

I guess what Iâ€™m trying to say is that teens can be pretty dumb and are generally not very good at communicating their feelings. OP doesnâ€™t give any details about what they felt was bullying nor did he tell us whether or not he confronted this supposed bully about it. Did this kid bully OP and make their life miserable? Maybe. Or was this kid just someone OP didnâ€™t like and disagreed with and OP felt this disagreement in itself was â€œbullyingâ€? Also maybe, we donâ€™t know. 

What we do know is that a 17 year old died and OP is *celebrating* it. Is OP an asshole for feeling relieved? Absolutely not. Is OP an asshole for gloating over someoneâ€™s untimely death? Yeah, kind of. Even if this kid was indeed a bully, he still had most of his life ahead of him and in this life he could still have become a better person. So itâ€™s a gentle YTA from me."
