What about this, she seams unconscious, if this is true this could the normal situation where it takes days or weeks to pass away, remember assisted suicide is frowned on/ illegal. He most likely been sitting there hour after hour with his brain going through countless dark and heartbreaking thoughts. Then after a long time he tries to do a small distraction from the long long silence to bring a little happyness into his life. People actually answered his call and helped cheer him up in what ways they could.  
  
Or maybe situation 2 she is awake through some of it, again she has been dying for days, and they have run out of things to talk and cry about and both of them need a distraction, guess what? Same thing happens, strangers show up and keep them both company. People who havent lost someone seriously close to them have no idea how insainely drawn out and heartbreaking the whole thing is.
