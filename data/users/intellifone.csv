If you’re looking to improve in the bedroom, the only way to do that is foreplay. More and better foreplay. Foreplay is how you get her to beg for more and how to make yourself feel like putting your penis in her will save your life and prevent imminent death. 

You’ve heard of edging right? That’s basically what foreplay is for women. It will get her so worked up that if she hasn’t cum by the time you get to the actual sex, she will probably cum before you when you put it in. 

Seriously. I’m the kind of guy that only lasts a few minutes, but mixing up caressing her neck and thighs and pulling her close from her lower back when kissing her, kissing her neck and ears and sucking/licking nipples, fingering, oral, she’s begging for sex. And I haven’t even gotten my dick wet yet. You can finger her for a bit and when she’s close you can stop or slow down and move on to something else. 

Do a minute of pumping and then hop off and start sucking her nipples and fingering to give your lil guy a break. Then go back to it for another
minute. You’ll want to keep going but have the control to stop. That’s edging for yourself. 

Eventually, the combination of her enthusiasm and your practice at edging yourself will increase your confidence (because she’s enthusiastic) and will increase your stamina (because you’ve been practicing delaying orgasm).

Do it."

My gf has been stressed as hell at work and stress kills her libido. I’ve been super patient and understanding with her but it finally got to be too much after being turned down so much. She’s the type that only gets turned on when she’s persued, although I think that’s partially a form of laziness. But I like going after her. Yet I was getting constantly turned down. 

I told her what was up. I told her basically, “I know intellectually what the truth is and that you’re also struggling and that you’re aware of it and that it makes you feel bad but you don’t want to say anything, but I also still feel like you’re not paying enough attention to me, that I’m doing all of the work and while I understand that you’re super stressed and you don’t mean to, it’s also difficult for me. And I just need you to know that I still love you, but that it hurts sometimes.”

She cried which is what I was avoiding by not telling her, but because she was sad that she upset me. We’ve been a lot more open and she told me that she had gotten into a cycle of anxiety from her work stress making her not horny and then not being horny causing stress because she thought that she was letting me down because she knows that she told me that she likes the hard to get kind of foreplay and it wasn’t making her horny because she was stressed and that she knows that she was disappointing me after trying to get her in the mood but not getting any kind of response. It was just a feedback loop of stress. 

But I told her that I didn’t want her to feel like she was making me upset if she wasn’t in the mood, that if she was stressed or had a headache or stomach ache that I wouldn’t be in the mood either until she felt better. That if she told me that her stomach hurt or that she was stressed from work and needs to relax that I wouldn’t even try to initiate. 

And that’s been working. Her stress levels have lowered a lot which means she’s hornier more frequently, although work stress is still there, and because she lets me know when she’s stressed, I don’t try to initiate and make her more stressed by feeling guilty. Sex still isn’t back up to 100% but it’s closer to 80% than the 10% it was at. And the work stuff should be back to normal soon too.

ABoringDystopia,fet0g21,t3_eqgx7k,1579370687.0,"It’s a perfectly acceptable system that we’re not using correctly.

It’s a system that was designed to be regularly overhauled. From 1787-1992, ignoring the bill of rights. We had amendments to the constitution every decade or so on average. We haven’t had any since then. Almost 30 years of no change. Society has changed immeasurably since 1992 and we have had no structural changes. 

Jefferson originally wanted the whole document scrapped every 20 years or so.

But, any political system is vulnerable to corruption. A big problem is that as the country has stopped identifying itself as a collection of states and more of a singular national entity, we have lost sight that the system was not just designed with 3 branches as checks and balances, but also with the states as a check against the federal government and the federal government as a check against the states. We have forgotten that the states should be used to experiment with social programs and new forms of democratic inclusion. The states are now entirely subservient to the federal government. 

I’m no proponent of state government supremacy. The states fuck up as frequently or more than the federal government. I’m a proponent of state government creativity. The stakes are lower at the state level. A state fuck up os less harmful than a federal fuck up. Let’s do some creative things and then start apply the things that work to the federal government."

funny,fesc3r1,t1_fervjhu,1579363732.0,"Anerican homes have several different common types of heating depending of where and when they were built. 

In most “old” big cities you’ll see radiators. Those have a fluid, usually water, but sometimes they’re closed circuit and use something else like an oil that has a higher heat capacity. It’s fairly easy to install this because pipes are compact and fit into walls and ceilings and floors that aren’t designed for air ducts. 

In really old places you’ll have wall heaters or locally placed furnaces. These can be gas or electric and are just bigger versions of space heaters.

Then there is central air. Air heated by a furnace is blown through ducts that are routed under the floor, through the attic, or between the space between the first and second floors. I don’t know what determines why you’d choose as a builder or as an HVAC installer you do floor vs ceiling ducts. Floor ducts always seem to get blocked by pets and furniture and bags or are by doorways. They always point up and never put into the room. But, heat rises so maybe it allows smaller ducts and a weaker blower because the air naturally mixes? The ceiling ones are usually at the top of a wall instead of the actual ceiling and point out into the room. Those seem to be more common on homes built in the western US since the 1980’s.

Part of real sex and relationships is the “will they won’t they”. It’s a thrill.

It used to be that you could have a pizza guy come to the door in porn and they’re like, “can I pay with sex?” And you’re like, “oh damn, that’s crazy. What if that happened in real life. What a surprise. What a fantasy.” But then it became cliche and it’s not exciting anymore.

In porn, if there are two people in a scene, it’s a given that they will have sex. In real life, the offer to have sex is often turned down. Especially with strangers and even frequently in even healthy relationships. But in porn, any proposal will eventually be given into. They may say no more than once but they will eventually enthusiastically say yes.

But with the stepmom/stepsister dynamic, it’s the final thing that could never really happen in real life but wouldn’t technically be wrong and so may happen in a thousand years. There’s a chance. There’s a thrill. It’s a little taboo, but not too taboo."

I think Buttigeig has that all on the surface. I think a couple other candidates also have it but for other reasons didn’t catch on. 
But Booker always has come across to me as the loud guy in class that everyone ignores and then the popular kids says the same thing and everyone is on board.

todayilearned,feabv3d,t1_fe8uwkt,1578946771.0,"The IRS and taxes in a democratic society are a necessary good. Not evil. 

Taxes provide the ability for society to provide necessary goods and services at a cost that allows marginalized citizens to access things they otherwise would be financially prohibited from doing so. It allows the profits gained from the commons to be spread out to commoners rather than held by the lucky individuals who benefit from the fact that economies of scale exist and are efficient.

If it was efficient for me to cut down a tree in a forest and process it for lumber and paper and cardboard, I would, but it’s not. So some other guy gets to cut down public forests, or mine precious minerals. I would do it too, but I dont have the capital for the equipment either. 

I don’t have the capital to get started investing in a startup that exploits natural resources or have the ability to build my own roads or the time to collaborate with my fellow citizens to maintain the road in from of my own property that is also used commonly by semi trucks and delivery vans and other people trying to get to their house a mile down the road.

Taxes are necessary for society to benefit from the exploitation of land and labor that is carried out by a few lucky and hard working people. But luck plays a huge role too. And taxes benefit them also. Taxes allow jets to not collide with Bill Gates private jet and Jeff Bezos rockets. Taxes allow rich people to enjoy clean water on their private lakes that haven’t been polluted by big factories that are prohibited by tax funded agencies from dumping waste in those lakes and rivers.

Taxes allow government agencies to verify that car manufacturers are actually producing cars that emit as little pollution as they say they do in order to prevent them from misleading you. 

Taxes are good and I am happy to pay what they’ve determined I need to pay. Would I like to pay fewer taxes? Yeah. But nothing is free."

I don’t use them with my gf, but I would in an instant if she asked or I thought she was skipping on her birth control or was worried she wasn’t exclusive anymore.

And, as for using tinder to find a relationship, it’s not that difficult. It’s the same as finding a FWB. You wouldn’t have a FWB that you’re not comfortable chatting with, who makes you uncomfortable, etc. But, the difference is what you’re both open to. If you want to find something that could potentially be a relationship, then the other person has to be open to the idea as well. My current gf was one of 3 girls I was chatting with at the same time, except I knew after the first date that I’d probably be dropping the other two or just letting them naturally fade away quickly and not seek any others. When we talked we both said we were just looking to causally date but we’re open to something serious if we met the right person. The next day, I realize girl #2 ghosted me. Then girl #3 I dropped a few days later. For the first couple weeks with current GF I was basically her booty call but I knew I liked her a lot. It’ll be a year in a couple weeks. 

If you start a relationship (FWB or otherwise) with the door closed to something else and the other person has shut that door as well, it’s difficult to open that door. You both may be interested in something more with each other, but are afraid to lose the other by trying to redefine thing or have mentally put the other into the “don’t date” mental category. So even if you’re both into it, it somehow becomes difficult to redefine the person mentally as something other than what they are to you now. So when you split up, the next person you’re FWB with, you can date because you didn’t close them off. You wonder why you could make something serious work with one FWB but not the other. It’s because you put the first person in a different box than the one you did end up dating."

Take the active ingredients separately depending on the symptoms you have.

Take cetirizine (Zyrtec) for the sniffles and general seasonal allergy related symptoms. Or Flonase (I like nasal sprays)

And for when your nose is really stuffed, use a oxymetazoline nasal spray (don’t take it frequently. It can be addictive). 

Then you can hit a ton of different symptoms the right way. The cold isn’t one thing.
