memes,ff3iw88,t1_ff3b76f,1579542002.0,"I think people should be aware just how small the demographic of viable esports pros is. For most games, the highest ranks are like .5% of the population (even less in some cases) and of that .5% the viable esports candidates are maybe a hundred to a few hundred. Even then, an average esports career doesn't last for more than two years, and unless you are in the upper echelons of the pro scene, you won't get enough money or fame to sustain off of deals and streaming.

2) probably not (assuming an explosion)

3) a multitude of sensors would possibly prevent this

In time, you find friends ( who I've also fucked over) and decide to go rogue. But at every step you get thwarted, every win you get only brings on a bigger beatdown. The police knows but I've paid them off, other neighborhoods know but they are either too scared or don't care to step in, not after the incident ten years ago when me and my friends came in and had a 'party'.

So one day things have mellowed down, it seems as if the family can finally relax. I barely visit anymore. But you are still angry. Where is your justice? Who will make it right? No one, only you can - or so you convince yourself.

You set up mean pranks. Whenever i give an inch you try to take a mile and one day when you least expect it, I come into your home again when you are with your buddies and slit their throats.

Don't cry about it. It was hardly undeserved!"

dankmemes,fdh6min,t1_fdh4jik,1578416505.0,"~~Russia doesn't have more nukes~~, and they don't invest anywhere near as much into military. They just don't go out of their way to maintain a presence in places they have no business in, and geographically are a bitch to invade. That's not to say they are weak, just that in a defensive setting they wouldnot lose, and if they did they'd make it extremely costly. Forget Vietnam lmao, they'd never make if through the tundra. And good luck having Europe or China let them setup in their borders.

Maybe Turkey, but I doubt they want to be in the way of possible nukings."
