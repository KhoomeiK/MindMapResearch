HoldMyKibble,ffb2o34,t1_ffaywzo,1579750259.0,All the time!!! He gives me the dirtiest looks when I ask him to play connect 4 he must think I am so strange.
HoldMyKibble,ffa422j,t1_ffa1kdt,1579727466.0,He’s a great dog! Because he’s a mix though you can never be certain of coat type or temperament so bear that in mind. Purebred is much more predictable. Also if you get a curly pup you’ll want to invest in a regular grooming schedule these guys matt up like crazy and it’s painful if you aren’t on top of it. Otherwise A* highly recommend.

OpenDogTraining,feinjxe,t1_feiavcd,1579142700.0,"I also use the next cue as a reinforcer in a behavior chain! In those cases you don’t need the marker. So it works. I think you’re right though, silence as a keep going signal may be effective in the obedience ring where my method is more suited to this kind of precision shaping work. My boy doesn’t have much drive to work continuously without a marker, we can do 1-2 mins tops before I have to say something. It’s something we are working on but I’ve never done any dog sports so I guess I’ve optimized for a different system."

OpenDogTraining,feepv31,t1_fdlodaj,1579038698.0,"Sorry about the delayed response, my browser crashed and I was too frustrated to re-write it at the time. Links are what broke the browser so I will add links in a reply to my own comment later.  


Basically I would use the clicker to teach a brand new behaviour. This takes my dog from no understanding to behavioural fluency. I move to a verbal marker when the behaviour is clearly understood, under decent stimulus control and sufficiently generalised (""proofed"").  


Treat placement markers: important for tricks where my dog needs to finish in a certain position. For example with rebound (link below, maybe), I want to throw the treat away from me so he lands square - if I have the treat in my hand he will flip around to face me and potentially hurt himself. The verbal marker that means ""treat to ground"" is used here, so that he anticipates having to look for it and not having to reposition to face me. I would also use this for things like teaching a release cue (e.g. ""break"") so my dog understands that it's OK to break position.   


Variable schedules of reinforcement are for fading the treats out in favour of verbal praise or other non-food reinforcement. Understanding reinforcement variety and reinforcement schedules are essential to not being ""hooked"" on treats forever as an R+ trainer. Basically you want to go from being a vending machine (1 behaviour in, 1 treat out) to being a slot machine (1 behaviour in, ?? out). This keeps your dog hooked on the game whilst removing the food. First order of business is to switch up the prizes. Sometimes it's praise, sometimes it's kibble, sometimes it's walks, sniffy time, play with a rope toy or a piece of hot dog. Sometimes it's a smile and nothing more. Sometimes it's nothing, depending on what you're doing (not recommended unless doing something like search and rescue work where you can't reinforce the dog in the moment but need the alert behaviour to continue). This keeps your dog guessing and engaged but it's essential your dog is fluent in the behaviour first - if you try to drop treats when your dog is still learning, they will take a smile as ""I did it wrong :("" and you'll shoot yourself in the foot and weaken the behaviour. When your dog is used to reinforcement variety, you can drop the treats out gradually. I usually start with 75% on, 25% off (my yes marker) and work towards my 25% on and 75% off ""nice"" marker. After that, I drop the marker all together and reinforce randomly at a maintenance level (<1% - 10% depending on the behaviour) - my dog is basically doing behaviour out of pure habit at that point. Please note, I'm taking about food reinforcement here. If I can reinforce my dog for free with a walk or sniffing or verbal praise then you betcha I'll take the time to do that just because I can. I always acknowledge a correct response with at least a smile. A true variable schedule is no reinforcement at all, but I find that it's a little confusing for my dog - it works for a rat in a box, but in real life my dog interprets no reward as ""wrong answer"" so I avoid doing that to keep my intentions clear.  


Do you need different markers for different schedules? Probably not. But the more you reinforce a marker, the stronger it is, so I figured it would be good to have a gradient. On the ground.... I don't think it's necessary. Just keep your clicker for learning, and one verbal marker for your variable schedules and you're probably golden.  


However, it's useful to mark all correct responses even if you don't reward. This way your dog knows it was a correct response, and doesn't get upset when you don't reinforce (no reinforcement = incorrect response, try something different next time = NOT what you want). So yes, better to mark 4 correct responses with nice and reward only one, than to mark only one behaviour with nice and reward all marked responses but none of the unmarked correct responses.  


I hope that makes sense, this writing isn't my A game as I'm cracking this out quickly between lessons."
Dogtraining,fdqm40f,t3_emm1on,1578669928.0,I'm a dog trainer. I vote move. Trainers can't fix a problem unless the client wants it to change and puts a lot of effort into their dogs.
rarepuppers,fdm6g6a,t1_fdm3it8,1578540952.0,I had no idea this was a thing! Thanks!
OpenDogTraining,fdkql3m,t1_fdk8h3w,1578509093.0,"> Do you stop using your voice as a tool when you are on the clicker or can you praise the dog? I use my voice a lot, changing tones, and I'm not sure I can stop doing it! 

Me too! I use my voice a lot, but it's mostly for me and not for my dog. When using any kind of audible cue you should carefully decide what you want that cue to mean and be consistent with how it sounds and what it means. The clicker always sounds the same, is very distinct and always means the same thing. As long as your cues are also clear in this way, you're set. Be aware that because humans talk a lot, verbal cues lose some of their effectiveness when compared to the clicker. 

Verbal praise is a reward, not a cue or verbal marker. Praise has it's place, but it comes after the behaviour as a reinforcer. A cue is a signal to your dog, a marker marks the correct behaviour and praise is a reward. They all have their place but are different types of communication.

&#x200B;

> The other question is for duration markers. I have a duration marker (""good"") and a terminal marker (""yes!""). If I were to start clicker training I guess that the idea is to replace the ""yes!"" with a click, but what about the duration marker? 

I personally do not use duration markers as I don't believe they are helpful. I do have some different event markers that I will use - ""Yes"" = 75% chance of getting a treat and ""nice"" = 25% chance of getting a treat. So sometime I will mark a behaviour then move on to the next one before my dog gets a treat. This is a variable schedule of reinforcement rather than anything to do with duration, but it can look a bit like a ""keep going"" signal. When training duration (wait there, hold that, keep in position etc) I make duration part of the criteria for clicking - I won't click unless the allotted time has elapsed.   


> Can I work with the two communication systems with the same dog for different purposes (definitely in different sessions)?

It sounds to me like you only have 1 system of communication, you're just talking about how to organise your tools inside of it (clicker, verbal marker(s), verbal praise). I don't think there's anything contradictory here that would make it two systems. The clicker is for teaching brand new behaviours because it has the most distinct sound and the strongest response (I always keep my clicker on a continuous schedule of reinforcement. 1 Click = 1 treat).   


Verbal markers are for better known behaviours, and I use them differently - usually for variable schedules of reinforcement/ variable reinforcement variety, however you can use them to indicate to your dog where your treat will go (e.g. ""good"" = treat tossed to floor, move whereas ""yes"" = treat delivered to mouth, stay in position, ""mat"" = go to your mat for a treat).  


I'm not sure if I answered your questions, or made you more confused. But this is how I think of these tools in my own head."
OpenDogTraining,fdkowyn,t1_fdkcy6e,1578508098.0,"I station my dog between each play to set him up for success and limit things like frustration and impatience. Going to the mat between repetitions teaches him to wait until I'm ready. 

Additionally: he has to hold the token between his teeth so that it hangs out. Placing him allows me to hand him the token so he takes it correctly and ensure he's angled mostly correctly for successfully completing the task (if he approaches side on, we're screwed). Over time, I could proof this so that he could pick up the token correctly without me handing it to him (he's already pretty much there) and approach from any angle and learn to position himself so that he succeeds. But for now, this is the best way to help him succeed. 

Additionally, if you have any fear of your dog choking (running off with, eating, chewing the token) then stationing makes it a bit more predictable and thus safer."
OpenDogTraining,fdk4d2s,t3_eltlwg,1578495755.0,"This is Percy. He can do a lot of things but this is possibly my favourite. I trained it through shaping (a clicker training technique).

He can’t actually connect 4. This is all about precision - slotting a token into a small space. It’s not easy physically.

If the lack of mental challenge disappoints you here not to worry [I taught him to sort coins](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/eija1o/i_taught_my_dog_to_sort_coins/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) which is more mentally challenging but easier physically ;).

AnimalsBeingBros,fdb957y,t1_fdb8mfc,1578255079.0,Yeah that’s reasonable
rarepuppers,fda7z5l,t1_fda70fp,1578242756.0,"Hahaha actually he wins whenever he posts a token through the slot. The accuracy and dexterity is what makes this a good trick. He’s not actually very good at the game ;)

Differentiating between objects is a different kettle of fish! Dogs are colourblind but not completely, they can still see some colours and besides, even if this video was greyscale you could spot the difference in the tokens due to the tone/shade. Colour is hard though, especially if it’s the only difference. Percy can sort coins which look, feel and smell/taste different [(video here)](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6wjkfCBId2/?igshid=1e8ebx2x0f7ug) but I haven’t asked him to sort anything by colour alone yet."
BeAmazed,fda3q4w,t1_fd9499l,1578241328.0,It’s honestly pretty complex. You need a good retrieve and drop it first (so good you can be absolutely SURE she won’t swallow the pieces). Then you teach her to “post” a medium sized object through a large hole (ball into a box for example). Then you work on progressively smaller objects through progressively smaller holes until she can do a token through a slot.
BeAmazed,fda3cjk,t1_fd7fh6f,1578241171.0,"Thanks! He definitely enjoys training, he will get excited when he sees the clicker and he’d prefer to train for treats rather than eat those same treats straight out of a bowl!"

rarepuppers,fd91e5m,t1_fd8rhev,1578226777.0,"Hire a trainer to help you. I’m a trainer - this is the sort of thing I do daily to earn my keep. It’s not a difficult process but it takes patience and some knowledge of classical and operant conditioning. Basically though:

- Start with items she’s happy to drop for a treat (eg a stick for a cube of cheese or a small piece of boiled chicken)
- use a clicker so treats are not shown up front 
- work your way up slowly from items she doesn’t care about to ones she does 
- make drop it’s fun MOST of the time (90% of the time she gets a treat then you give her the item back... only 10% of the time do you take the item off her). This means for every functional drop it where you need her to drop something you practice 9 at home.
- address attention seeking behaviour by teaching retrieve-a-toy and rewarding this with attention. Give her a way to ask properly, rather than inventing her own ways to get your attention.
- don’t force her to give her item up. Fighting her for it may make her more defensive"

rarepuppers,fd90d1s,t1_fd8u3zm,1578226266.0,"Yeah, it is. First you have to teach them how to hold it carefully and carry it and be absolutely sure they won’t choke. To this end my dog has a lot of training on retrieves, drop it etc. Then it’s a case of retrieving smaller objects. Then teaching him to “post” the token through increasingly smaller slots until he can put it in place with extreme accuracy. Then you teach carry the token and put it in the slot. This is probably the most complicated trick he knows."

rarepuppers,fd7sc4n,t1_fd7r45r,1578209336.0,"Anything is possible, but it’s very unlikely. He knows the task, and I am careful to make sure there’s no running or sudden moves involved. I use a mat to station him between plays so even his movement back and forth is part of the trick. He has to carry the token the way he does - between his front teeth - or it won’t fit in the slot. I’m right there. If there’s any deviation from the trick then I just cue “drop” and he will drop it. He will drop a whole hot dog if I ask, his drop is rock solid. Worst case I can grab him but I’ve never had to do that.
For an average dog, yes, carrying small items like this is a big no and a choking hazard. But I know what I am doing as does my dog and I have minimized the risk to the point where it’s acceptable (basically extremely low). Accidents do happen but honestly he’s more likely to choke on a kibble or part of a toy when I’m not watching than under my supervision doing tricks.
I hope that eases your fear for him. He’s fine, I promise."
