todayilearned,ffq6wz3,t1_ffq6ayd,1580123738.0,"Hmm I was genuinely curious to learn something but this isn't making sense to me.
 
In my experience people with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia often don't recognize close family and friends, or confuse them for other people. So seeing a spouse doesn't seem like it would do anything. 

Plenty of elderly people have flags flying outside their front door, at least in the US, and a unique grandfather clock or some other object seems way more personal than a front door which can be pretty generic, and if they aren't ""allowed"" outside what good does a fake door do them? 

I've heard about going through a doorway and forgetting about what you went in for because of your brain taking in a different environment or some such thing, so maybe that ties into it. Aside from that I can't see what happens neurologically to associate a door specifically with that comfort. Not trying to be snarky, I'm just genuinely curious what makes that connection."
