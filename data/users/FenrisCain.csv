There are several estimates of how long there was between serenity and objects in space, from a few months to years but i honestly dont see any evidence that the rescue was a second rescue.

LoL until a few years ago(sorry I've not been playing since before the change) featured the [rune system](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Runes_(Historical)).

I'm far from up to date with WoW but grinding for arena gear in that game is so notorious i see no need to even explain it to you. Even if this has now been changed, LoL and Wow were both undeniably competitive games while these systems were in place.

Guns are cool.  
Religion is law.  
Government is corrupt.     
Corporations are even more corrupt.  
Racial problems and inequality are blatant even in big cities from what I've seen (i.e. everyone in a suit is a white man and every fast food worker is an immigrant).  
Sports are mostly weird variants of European sports and are worth huge money even at highschool/college level.  
Sports fans and their rivalries are about the same as elsewhere in the world.  
People are generally outgoing and friendly though this may be because im Scottish and nearly every white American i met can apparently trace their Scottish heritage.   
Education seems to vary vastly based on income.  
Obviously your media is dominant around the western world.  
Celebrity worship seems similar to Europeans for most people but damn your crazy fans beat any crazy fans i know back home.  
Politics seems to be 100% about voting with your tribe.  
Your twat in charge is pretty similar to ours except orange and illiterate.  
Murdoch has just as much of a stranglehold over your media and elections as ours.   
Freedom and the constitution are hugely important but only when they agree with your(or your parties) point of view.


Based off of my maybe 10 trips to the states and consuming us media/reading up on politics. Feel free to disagree.


Edit: also im sorry but good god your food is awful, im not talking about restaurants as they can obviously vary massively but even food and drink in your stores is just full of chemicals and corn syrup.
