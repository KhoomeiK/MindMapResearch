DeadBedrooms,fdrzix0,t3_emupt6,1578692053.0,"My partner is somewhat similar. But, his love language is acts of service....and he initiates...just awkwardly IMO. 
I was able to get more touches from him by telling him about reading about “Unspoken Consent.” I gave a few simple examples of unspoken consent in relationships and some things that I consider go without saying? Sharing a drink, showering together....just a bunch of stuff we don’t normally ask permission for....And I just lumped physical contact in there. THEN I asked him his take on the whole thing. Does he agree or disagree....why/why not....and his personal examples. 
I’ve written it poorly here. I didn’t bombard him...it was a back and forth. I just raised the topic and engaged a conversation about it with him and let him speak and agree or disagree freely.  He has definitely increased his casual physical contact. Not to my level as he is Acts of Service through and through. But the effort really makes a difference.

**Edit: I wanted to add that he gives off that same sense of being timid about it. He’s not a shy guy but that’s how it seems when it comes to contact. Like he is worried it will be rejected. I had tried other things previously with little to no results"

When he expressed that he wanted to lose some weight? Rather than just telling him not to worry, that he looked fine, In that exact moment I sat down with him and we worked out a game plan for success. And, I offered to do it with him. I have lost a few pounds due to tightening up what was already my regular diet and some pretty lengthy and difficult hikes...but he’s been the real winner. He has about ten pounds left and he will no longer be considered overweight. He plans on going further but we are excited to celebrate this first big goal reached. 
Overall I think team work and encouragement rather than criticism is the best route. He’s had a couple days where he just wanted to eat burgers and fries? I did that with him too. And the next day?

If she is shorter and sedentary at work, and you are taller and move more during the day, she will be larger. It’s pretty easy these days to find what our caloric intake should be based on height, sex, and activity level. Once you find that out you simply create a caloric deficit and the weight will come off regardless of fat burning activities. Once the weight is down, energy will be regained, making her more inclined to get active. There is loads of information on this around the web, in books, and some great subs in Reddit.

But, it’s valid. Everyone....and I mean EVERYONE has a line when it comes to weight. People want to act like it isn’t an thing. But it definitely is. A few extra pounds....even an extra 30 or even 60 (or even more I guess) might be tolerable for some. But push that up to 35 or 65 and it’s gone too far. Because there is a line. There is also the behavior that comes with weight. 
Having a child isn’t a super valid issue for maintaining weight. For gaining? Yes. Maintaining? No. Because weight can be lost if the effort is applied. 
90% of weight loss is diet change. Change the food around the house. Offer up a healthy or clean diet that you can both go on. Get apps and even a food scale. You eat at maintenance and she eats at a deficit. This formula actually works. My partner has lost 52 pound since September 13. We work as a team and track weight, inches, and go out together and buy him bits of a entirely new wardrobe as celebration. We also now walk together and it’s some of our best conversation time. 
By not saying anything there is a possibility of more gain and this getting even worse.
Simply tell her you are thinking about changing the way you eat as a family. For the good of you and your child and you’d like her to be on board."

Get a food app and start tracking everything you eat. Learn about portion sizes. Get a food scale if you have to. Quit drinking calories by cutting out all the sugary drinks. 
If you really want to lose weight then eat less. Drink more water. It’s that simple. 

What’s the point of having someone talk down to you? How are you supposed to succeed and then keep the weight off if that is your motivation? Wont you just go back to over eating when the insults stop?

Just remember when you slip up account for it and start back on track that same day or the very next morning. Just keep going. The structure and control over your body and diet will eventually aid you in coping with stress. 2020 is gonna be your year to win!!
fatlogic,fclzgt4,t3_ehthqm,1577760290.0,"First of all weight has absolutely no bearing on my relationships with people. 

Secondly? Heavy people approach ME about weight loss...not the other way around. I couldn’t give the world smallest turd about anyone else’s body besides my own. And when they do ask? They don’t believe what I tell them any damn way.

Thirdly bigger bodied women who I don’t have established relationships with tend to treat me like crap for having the audacity to exist in MY body around them. So, I don’t waste my time trying to do anything about theirs. Why would I? If they wanted to do something about it they would. 


Finally, I don’t instigate talk about diet or fitness with them because it’s not safe common ground.  I talk about mutual things like kids,  partners, candles, and a new mascara I tried. 

It’s ludicrous to imply that all thin people talk about is being thin.  They want to been seen as more than a fat body? Maybe they should apply the same logic to them people. Fucking 
hypocrites."

Unhappiness in a relationship can go on for a very long time before someone gives up completely. It’s rarely sudden in my experience."

badwomensanatomy,fcgaw35,t1_fcaeqev,1577638176.0,Your thinking about the outside of the vagina. The vulva. The INSIDE part is the vagina. And it does clean itself. How did you think semen and blood from periods gets cleared out? Because (as the owner of one) I’m hear you tell ya that it flushed itself out.
DeadBedrooms,fcak56i,t1_fcagv5h,1577570767.0,"Oh it’s definitely harder on the non-affectionate person to pick it up.

On my end? It’s simple! He feels appreciated if I mention to others that he cleaned the gutters or (on my end) if I make his plate or keep his drink filled....offer to give him a hand on a little handy jobs or simply thank him for mowing the lawn. Maybe buy him some shoes or a jersey every now and again. It’s pretty much as simple as that.


And on my end I honestly FEEL like what I want is that simple too. An arm around the waist. A kiss on the forehead. Just touches. It seems so simple to me. But, after meeting my partner? I see that it’s just not a natural instinct for him to touch. And to overcome that is a hell of a lot harder than remembering to brew some iced tea or order a new hat off amazon. 
It literally never crossed his mind to do it. Because HE was doing what was important to him. Spending tons of time, doing little handy things, finding common interests. He thought he was doing everything right. And when I told him about it? He still didn’t get it. Not fully. 
But! As slow as it is? It HAS changed him. Like I said he has started to seek out contact. He will walk up and poke me in the side. Or crook his finger and lightly stoke my cheek...reach out in the night and lightly scratch my head....maybe seek out my foot with his own. It used to feel....forced? Like both of us were on alert in those really early attempts. But, even though it’s not at my ideal level. It feels natural to have contact at this point.... So if you feel that uncomfortableness?? Don’t let it get you down or scare you off. Cause I think it’s normal that it’s awkward for both. It gets better. 
It becomes at the very least pleasant for both even if it’s not a comfort. 

I hope you guys can talk this all out and work it all out without judgement. My partner had to look at me plenty of times and say “HEY! This is me trying.”  And, really make me see it. So, it takes work on both sides. But, the willingness to do it? It makes all the difference. It’s so precious and endearing for me now looking back on the effort we put in. Felt rough at the time though! 😁"
DeadBedrooms,fc8rnvt,t3_egn6vs,1577540768.0,I mean....if you are setting her up with kissing and touching to where she thinks it’s going to lead to sex...and then it doesn’t? No. That’s absolutely not going to work.
DeadBedrooms,fc7hvh5,t3_egkvu0,1577507922.0,"It’s shitty..but the burden isn’t entirely on him. 

He isn’t the only person who is turned off by extra weight beyond a certain point. Far from it actually. 

I personally find bigger dudes attractive....but there is a line for me as well. Anything beyond that line I’m simply not attracted to. 

Also, you seem to also be negatively affected by the weight. Unhappy with it and your appearance. If that’s the case it really doesn’t matter how he reacts to the loss. If YOU will feel better and it will improve your self esteem? Lose the weight. 

And, on a final note. It’s not always the actual body that makes someone who has gained weight unattractive. It the behaviors that come along with the weight.  Many times weight sucks the life out of people. They become a shadow of who they were before the gain when they had more energy. 
I don’t know if that’s the case for you. But, I’ve heard it mentioned many, MANY, times over the years about friend’s and family’s partners have gained weight. “He/She NEVER wants to do anything but sit around”
“We never go anywhere unless she/he wants to get food.”
“He/she would rather sit and watch TV than do ______ with me.”  
I mean I could go on but I’m sure you have heard it.... So, sometimes it’s much more than just not LOOKING the same after weight gain. Sometimes people don’t act the same either. And maybe they don’t even realize that is a factor. 

If it were me? I’d lose it. I’d lose it and then I’d probably ditch him. But I’m not in love with the guy. You are. 
I’m sure you’ll get it sorted. 
You’re a Scorpio right?

DeadBedrooms,fc3rd7o,t3_ef4ju8,1577396693.0,"Hey, if she has expressed that she doesn’t want to have sex this isn’t going to work. This kind of thing can work in regular healthy bed rooms because there is already an unspoken consent in place. 
For example my partner doesn’t have to ask me or speak to me about sex if he wakes up in the night or early in the morning. He can “just stick it in” because we have already worked out between us that it is fine.
If he were to try and pull that right after I got home from work, before I had a chance to relax and get out of work/mom mode? It would be a HARD No....and I am the higher level. 
He wouldn’t do that though because he knows I’m not anywhere close to thinking about sex right then. He also knows that unless I’m in mom/work head space I’m always receptive so he doesn’t have to press the issue to get the attention he needs. 

Your Situation is different I’m guessing though. You have someone telling you No frequently. In that situation there isn’t unspoken consent. In that situation you can’t get away with “just sticking it in” without asking.  Just because it’s not violent like you mentally visualize it, doesn’t mean it’s not sexual assault. If ANYONE tells you No and you “just stick it in” it IS rape. It doesn’t matter if you see it as rape. It doesn’t matter if you don’t physically hurt them. It doesn’t matter if you love them. By doing that shit without permission you can totally fuck up their head in a million ways. You can make them not trust you. Not trust any men. Make them feel dirty, used, helpless, isolated.  And you CAN go to jail for it. It doesn’t matter if you are in a relationship or not. You CANNOT HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE WHO TOLD YOU NO. 

You need to find someone else who is a better match with you sexually. You can force this stuff. And you honestly shouldn’t be at the point where you are even considering it."
fatlogic,fc3bl66,t3_efwwwn,1577386178.0,"Wrong. Dieters fail themselves. They tell themselves that making adjustments won’t make a difference. When they see the scale tipping they tell themselves that it’s just a small gain and no big deal. They tell themselves they will start back up tomorrow...or Monday....or next week. 
When in reality they should be picking up where they left off that. Same. Day. 

It’s not the fault of the diet. If the diet was successful then it did exactly what it was supposed to do."
