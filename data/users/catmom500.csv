ClinicalPsychology,ff0wvwq,t3_eqz53w,1579473055.0,"As far as I know, there are no fully funded masters programs. Master's degrees are a massive money maker for universities; they cost a small fortune, but since there isn't a research component (i.e., no way for the university to make money off the students' work), there's no funding.

I could be wrong, and I'd be happy to have someone chime in with some examples, but I never came across one when I was looking at grad schools. For reference, I have a master's in psychology. It made sense for me since I was primarily interested in clinical work and there are VERY few fully funded doctoral programs that allow you to focus on qualitative research (which is my primary research interest). I also wasn't willing to move away from the west coast, so that limited my options."
psychotherapy,ff0vb78,t1_ff0o4xk,1579472636.0,"THIS. This is 90% of the work that needs to be done. Treating a kid with RAD as though they were the core of the problem is completely backwards. I don't know what the specialist is doing, but if it isn't heavily relational (i.e., working with parents to uncover their trauma, and teaching them how to lovingly, securely parent), that little one isn't going to get better."
psychotherapy,felqs0g,t1_fellra4,1579228662.0,"That feels a little melodramatic. I know where I work, since we take Medicaid, we're legally required to call at least three times before discharging. That's three total times that we attempt to make contact, so texting *could* count (although we try to keep that down).

I don't see how that's unprofessional. It feels unprofessional to me to just flake out on them the same way they flaked out on you. Three times means: trying once casually; a second time as follow-up; and a third time to say, ""If I don't hear from you by such-and-such date, I'll assume you're not interested at this time and wish you the best."" That feels pretty straightforward to me.

It also makes sense to me to be sensitive to where the relationship was at. If you'd been working together for a few months, three times might be overkill. But if you'd been working together for years, not at all."

psychotherapy,fefmgkw,t1_fef9c64,1579059500.0,"I've only interned/worked at three places so far. My last year of grad school I interned at a community mental health clinic, just working with adults. All of the full-time therapists/counselors were burnt out as hell and had, at minimum, case loads of eighty. I was 100% NOT okay with that, even though I'd hoped the internship would turn into a job. Seeing how that organization was run really worried me about community mental health.

At the same time I was working part time in a PHP/IOP treatment clinic for eating disorders. I wasn't in love with the job itself — I was a milieu therapist, which is sort of a glorified behavior tech kind of job — but the culture was substantially better, and it at least gave me hope that not all therapy jobs, outside of private or group practice, had to be awful. I also have a special interest in more acute patients and higher levels of care, so it was really cool to get to see some of that in action.

I currently work at another community mental health clinic, but it's COMPLETELY different. Caseloads are completely manageable; in my department, because we drive around a lot to different locations and do house visits, the norm is about 24 for someone who's full time. I work 36 hours a week, and do more assessments than my colleagues, so I have a caseload of about 16-18. In other departments, where they don't drive around so much, I believe the cap is 36-40. The culture is WAY healthier, and I get great supervision and support. I don't think I'll be in community mental health for my whole career, but this has been a fantastic out of grad school job."

psychotherapy,fef8sra,t1_fef882w,1579050885.0,"Sadly, this is very typical in a lot of community mental health these days. I live in Seattle, and I know of clinics where that's absolutely the norm (actually a little below the norm!). I'm incredibly fortunate to work somewhere much more reasonable, and I remind myself every week how lucky I am.

u/BringBackSonix, I'm wondering... This might be a pretty radical suggestion, but have you considered either taking time off from mental health altogether, or looking for another job? I know that taking time off can feel like declaring you're out of the profession altogether, but I've met therapists who took an entire year off to nanny or drive cabs, and it helped a TON. Alternatively, maybe you just need to find a not-so-horrible clinic.

I see the value of working with those populations, but then the work week should be, like, *maybe* 20 hours, if not less, and you should get paid twice as much. It takes so much time to metabolize trauma, and that's absolutely what they're putting you through."
psychotherapy,fef8076,t3_eoskf0,1579050350.0,"u/HellonHeels33, your point is totally valid. I'm fortunate in this regard, in that I live somewhere where this would never be an issue. With that in mind, I think it depends a little on what you mean by ""on an individual basis.""

I work with a modality called Child Parent Psychotherapy. In that approach, the little one (it can be used for birth to five) is the designated patient, but part of the initial/foundational phase actually includes a lot of one-on-one sessions with parents. You take trauma histories, do screens for depression and anxiety (for the parent, not the little one), and actually do some work helping them identify their own trauma history. The goal of all of this is to serve the *little one's* therapy. You're helping the parent(s) identify how their experience of, say, sexual abuse as a child has impacted how they parent, and thus, how it's impacted their own child and their reactions to them. But I am never the therapist for the parent. I make this very clear, and I actively encourage parents to get their own therapist. You also do one-on-one sessions with the parent in TF-CBT. That tends to be more psycho-educational in tone, but working with parents is important when seeing little ones.

I have honestly wanted to be the therapist for many family members; I tend to get so engrossed in people's lives. But I would never act as the therapist for more than one person in the family. For one thing, I'm not immune to getting pulled into the drama. And for another, even if I were magically immune, there's no way anyone else in the family could see me as immune."
socialwork,fef7582,t1_fee0kdd,1579049768.0,"In some states (like Washington, where I live) it is actually illegal for your internship to be paid. So it's not just a question of site; it's a question of law."
socialwork,fef72v5,t1_fedxma3,1579049724.0,">Not only are they ""working for free"" by interning and not getting paid by their agency, but they are essentially PAYING to do so.

THIS. THIS was what drove me absolutely insane every quarter. I paid $12,960 TO WORK FOR FREE.

I think the biggest difference it would have made to me would be less debt. I had to go tens of thousands of dollars into debt to work in a field where I am lucky to be making $23/hour."

socialwork,fdljr8c,t1_fdko749,1578525593.0,"Re: RO-DBT vs traditional DBT... 

It depends a lot on the diagnosis and the individual presentation. I've studied both, and RO-DBT is definitely oriented more towards over-controlled disorders and personalities; often this looks more like AN and ARFID. Traditional DBT is typically well-suited to disorders and personalities that incline towards under-control; often this would be more like BN and BED. But again, it depends. DBT was developed to treat Borderline Personality Disorder, which is sort of the quintessential disorder of under-control; DBT is designed to help people learn to develop boundaries and some modicum of control over themselves and their inner world. Most folks with AN and ARFID are already super over-controlled, and teaching them to lean into this is pretty counter-productive. Their boundaries are often WAY overdeveloped, to the point of not being able to emotionally connect to other people at all. Teaching them ""distress tolerance"" is like harping on the evils of sex to a mean-spirited nun.

In Lynch's book on RO-DBT, there's at least one very simple screen for over-control. I've used that for patients, regardless of whether we're looking at an ED or not. It's very useful to know which direction folks head to, including yourself!"

But if I were going to work towards unionization, I'd want it to be somewhere that I had plans of staying long-term (assuming I didn't get fired!). It's a lot of work to ask others to participate in, and I'd want to be able to say I was in it for the long haul."
socialwork,fdf3qmo,t1_fdc1ig7,1578352620.0,"The workaround, in the example I gave, is the employer asks you to:

1) work for three hours, then 

2) to take a couple of hours off, and 

3)  be back for a meeting or event or whatever that they want you to attend. They do this when paying you for all of the hours would put you into overtime.

To be clear, I've NEVER done this. I've been asked to do it at a past therapy job, and I refused. At my current job, other therapists do it on a semi-regular basis to keep their managers happy and I actively encourage them to also refuse. It's not technically illegal - 'Cause hey, you were totally off for that two-hour period! That's exactly like having normal time off! - but it is also OBVIOUSLY unethical.

psychotherapy,fcvvir7,t3_ej6ks0,1578011049.0,"In my job it's roughly 50%, but we never get any grief about it. I think that in other departments they have slightly higher expectations - like maybe 25 billable hours out of 40 - but in my department (infant and early childhood) we travel a ton and do so many home visits that they adjust the expectations. Also, I have a lot of say. I'm actually below 50%, technically, but it's because one day a week I'm supposed to be available to do nothing but mental health assessments. On average I think I end up only working 2 hours of that day, but that also means I can't schedule regular patients; it's effectively a lost day. I've talked to the supervisors and they all get it and they're not trying to increase my caseload.

dogs,fcthbg6,t1_fcrkfbp,1577943275.0,"Also, the rescue you got her from was doing a shit job of prepping her for normal dog-life, according to your earlier post.

I am super bummed for you on all of this, especially since you just went through a break-up, but this dog is way beyond you, and that's not your fault. I have more experience with dogs with behavioral issues than (it sounds like) you do, and I would probably consider this dog beyond me as well. 

Given that the rescue you got her from sounds like they were pretty irresponsible, would you feel better about reaching out to other local rescues and talking over what's been happening with them? I get that you want to avoid having her put down, but this dog needs a pretty serious intervention if that outcome is to be avoided.

And, for the record, if she does end up being put down, that is NOT your fault. Other people have mishandled this dog and taught her completely inappropriate and dangerous behaviors. You didn't cause this problem, and you absolutely need and deserve to be physically safe."
