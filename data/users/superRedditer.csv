lakers,fcb5ojg,t3_egvu97,1577582687.0,"trainer has a point.  if the trainer was a redditor like me he would get down voted like i do because good forbid you criticize lebron who gets blocked by shrimps and loses the game, or dribbles the ball off his foot and loses the game.... but is the greatest player of all time"
lakers,fcb0f8q,t1_fcay1cu,1577580206.0,this is what I'm saying... if LeBron insists on getting 25 and 10 no matter what we are going to lose.  other people need the ball in their hands for more seconds of the plays and he needs to do things that are not points and assists to help the team.  he will never do this.
musictheory,fcawcpv,t3_egv28v,1577577908.0,"you need to play a lot, listen a lot, and study chords a lot in detail.  a lot of people especially guitar players shortcut a lot of their chords assuming extensions don't matter or something.  try not to get hung up on anything and keep playing.  play with recordings, play with others, and stop studying.  studying is the curse of the modern age lol,yall are paralyzed.

lakers,fcauzev,t1_fcatz1l,1577577137.0,if he's too old then he needs to stop having the ball in his hands all the time.  I've watched him his whole car including when he was young and this is not really about his age.  he's always deflecting and has excuses ready.  this is typical LeBron.  Lakers are not winning any rings this year I'm afraid.  LeBron will get his numbers though.
