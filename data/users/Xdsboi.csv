AskReddit,ffb70qz,t1_ffb6rtv,1579753505.0,Thanks for getting back to me... Yeah unless something explicitly gets pinned on these guys they seem to be able to go about their merry way wherever they are.
bapcsalescanada,ffax0s7,t3_esl8bs,1579746458.0,"Suicide is such a jarring reminder of the reality some others are facing, particularly when you are stuck in your own mundane but content existence.  


I hope this guy didn't suffer too much for the months, days and moments leading up to this. It could have been a spur of the moment thing. RIP."

bapcsalescanada,ff4ue5n,t3_er9b32,1579572676.0,I bought this about 4 or 5 months ago for only $10 cheaper than this price. I have absolutely no complaints. My case and GPU fan are louder than the fan in this PSU.
PublicFreakout,ff4mwe8,t1_ff4mqoh,1579567484.0,"No it's not. My examples are of people stereotyping whole groups, which is what weak minded people unable to think in nuance do.

What you were doing was stereotyping."
PublicFreakout,ff4m1ie,t1_ff4lway,1579566879.0,Hmmm. I do agree that it seems excessive and definitely unprofessional.
PublicFreakout,ff4l66c,t1_ff4kj1n,1579566281.0,"Read your fucking comment.

How does it read any differently from someone who knows 1 or no minorities but spends all their time watching biased media about minorities going ""all blacks are like this..."" ""most brown people are like this"".

More than me disagreeing with it, it is logically unsound.

Your ""knowledge"" of police at most would be with like 0.001% of the policemen in America yet you speak like you know them all."
PublicFreakout,ff4jibv,t1_ff46dtn,1579565113.0,Your ability to stereotype a whole group with your very limited knowledge and interactions with said group remind me of some of the finest racists out there.
PublicFreakout,ff4igot,t1_ff3usgp,1579564397.0,"Would your perception change if the man had been a pedophile, rapist and child murderer that had been on the run through multiple states and kept the police on a high speed chase for over an hour, costing the state 10s or 100s of thousands of dollars and many police man hours?"

todayilearned,feny1ws,t1_femw41y,1579292548.0,"Do you happen to know any recent examples of a mathematician's work or discovery having a profound positive effect on the lives of the every man (ie. through a new technology or important function)?

I've read about past mathematical breakthroughs from like the 40s leading to contemporary technologies but know nothing about recent work."

Some Asian guy from Vancouver, on Facebook was recently ousted for doing this to apparently hundreds of girls online, with dozens of them saving screenshots. 

Though, he went much further then the slut comment and would lash out much more at every single girl, every time."

vancouver,feloux9,t1_feln49p,1579227336.0,"It's cool you're honest and own up to it.

I can see where you're coming from if talking to someone on the total other side of the discussion.

With me, I grew up with native kids and families. And just like any group again, some from the same families grew up to be great people and some grew up to becoming less than stellar.

I know some of the people who deem themselves (and are deemed) freedom fighting heroes. I see some videos they upload about ""expulging a white rapist of indigenous women"" from their lands, who was a random and polite 20ish year old dude in a car just trying to take a backroad to visit his family. Or clips of them protesting in a very public place, the police show up and very mildly ask them to leave, the protesters themselves get confrontational and/or violent, and then say they were beaten and brutalized yet again by the genocide supporting cops.

It is such fake, manufactured and misdirected outrage. It almost makes me outraged how they would diminish what their grandparents and ancestors and women actually endured by making the comparison."
vancouver,felmaeg,t1_fejrdrs,1579225573.0,"Here's the thing, in your statement ""Many First Nations youth resort to crime. For similar above reasons. Systemic racism, grew up poor, limited leadership."" you are excusing people of committing crimes because of their history.

You do know that the majority of people who commit ""serious"" crimes have a terrible background right? Murderers and rapists usually had very bad upbringings, socioeconomic settings and severe childhood abuse. Are you excusing all their actions as adults?

Secondly, there are absolutely some natives, just like in any group of people, that are not moral beacons of integrity. In my area there is a very outspoken family of natives against the pipelines. What they don't tell the media and news outlets though, is that their family also owns a prominent gas station in the area.

Learn to see things in shades of grey, not black and white."

vancouver,fef1hpy,t1_feevtjn,1579045961.0,"So now you are justifying the assault of someone in public, by a VERY public figure (through their own choice) as they are being questioned by a reporter DOING THEIR JOB. 

You're being an assault apologist justifying assault while talking about how awful name calling is."

politics,fcklopd,t1_fckg746,1577728045.0,"I think the point the other guy is making is that Trump and his supporters never had the nuance to even say ""Look guys, we're gonna take some hits and suffer for a while with this trade war, until we start winning!"" but instead sold it as ""We're gonna be winning the whole time! We're gonna own every country from beginning to end!"" but now that even some Trump supporters can feel negative effects of the trade war, they are backpedaling."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fcjborj,t1_fcaikhu,1577682317.0,"A college degree in GENERAL points to a few things, like ability to carry through on a longass task with no real visible sight of reward (paying for AND going to school when you don't have to, even less so than highschool), budgeting skills, usually higher socioeconomic standing, in GENERAL ability to plan out your life trajectory better, in general good socialization (you're meeting new people of new backgrounds every class for 4 years) etc.

I mean, if I had a business, and everything else was the same (ie. pay), and I got to choose either 10 random high school graduates, or 10 random college degree holders, you better fucking believe I'm going with the college graduates.

And I'm not talking about the rich asshole graduates that had everything paid for by their parents, or the athlete who got by only on his athletic ability, I'm talking the ones who absolutely cannot afford to go to university, but make it work by budgeting, working part time jobs, busting their ass studying in the AM,  because they think it'll get them a better life."

fightporn,fccdprg,t1_fc5ytty,1577597225.0,"Possibly. But no matter how much innate talent you have, you cannot rise up in the ranks (ie. to any professional level) without high amounts of dedication and time spent honing their craft. So it is those traits (dedication, consistency and ability to put in hard-work) which successful professional athletes have and which I admire.  


It's the same with any talent I believe. Even in university and academia, the genius like students still have to put in consistent work to become engineers, doctors and doctorate holders."
