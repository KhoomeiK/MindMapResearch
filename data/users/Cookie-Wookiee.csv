Neverwinter,fe72ljg,t3_eo1lxp,1578909091.0,"Warlock healers are absolutely viable in the current mod. What you'll want to focus on are: 

1. Bonding runestones. Get those bad boys up to 15 as soon as possible.

2. Outgoing healing companions. Get the four decently prized ones, with polar bear cub as active. The quickling is not worth 2 million in my opinion, so you can go for a power companion there. Outgoing healing is better than power, hence why focusing on the companions is a priority.  


3. Empowered runestones for your companion gear. Power and crit have no upper limit when healing, apart from the crit shouldn't be more than 25% higher than power (for capping it at 50%. More than that doesn't make a difference). Since you can get crit from the companion gear itself, it's useful to get power from the runestone. However, if you need the crit you can use profane runestones too. Essentially use what you need to balance your stats. A good pool of HP also helps, since a lock healer needs to be in the middle of the action more than a cleric or pala might need to.  


Things are about to change a bit in the next mod. Warlocks are getting a buff on the dps path, but whether it's enough to make a huge difference is yet to be seen.

It can arise from a huge number of things such as not absorbing enough in the gut or heavy menstruation or even running a lot (the red blood cells can get crushed inside the foot while running which means they need to be replaced and the body does not always recycle iron well).  


There are two main things people can do to get more iron in a vegetarian way as far as I know (although don't take my word as gospel. Talk to a doctor).   
1. Use a cast iron skillet or pot to make food. This is surprisingly effective.  
2. Eat supplements a couple times a week.  


I personally eat a vegetarian diet, although I used to suffer from iron deficiency way back when I ate meat. Nowadays I eat supplements about 3 times a week (a small capsule) and my iron values are fine. I've gotten them checked a couple of times since I started the supplement route.  


Sometimes people get deficiencies that has very little to do with their diet. There is nothing wrong with eating supplements if you need them, as long as they are not a replacement for a varied diet in general (as in don't just eat pasta and supplements for every meal, that's bad)."
