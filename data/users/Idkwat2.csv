medical_advice,fep9kdu,t3_eqalq2,1579315196.0,Working out muscles won’t make you lose your belly. To lose weight you need cardio. Doing things like running or jumping jacks or even riding a bike could help but your best bet is running. If you run you’ll lose fat and gain some leg strength. NAD

Drugs,fd2k5pw,t3_ejuj4w,1578148389.0,I’m not experienced with medical stuff but a way to get a little more information on your likelyhood of getting something is by seeing how far down in the trash bag the needle was. If it was farther down less risk if it was closer to the top it means it was used more recently and the chances of getting something from it are higher. Of course it could of fallen deeper or something but it’s an idea I wish you the best.
