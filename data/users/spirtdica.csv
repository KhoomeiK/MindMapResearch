That said, I can see why code changes cause uneasiness. I think it will be a sign of Monero's maturation if the hard fork schedule can be reduced to a yearly event. 





I'm of the opinion that utility as a store of value is a natural corollary of utility as a means of exchange. That's my biggest hangup with Bitcoin; the hard-coded block cap is just too small, even with Lightning. Payment channels have to be closed or rebalanced sometime.   At some point BTC will either have to hard fork or fade away. 





I think part of Monero's genius is how transaction fees, coin emission, and block size are all inter-related. It's one of the only cryptos to have a block size determined by the market for block space, giving it a unique advantage in on-chain scaling. 





Of course, one thing that is conspicuously absent is any sort of second layer solution. That being said, payment channel second layer solutions like LN are predicated upon the assumption that coins in different channels are fungible, so if/when Monero implements a second layer the robust fungibility of the base layer will be a tremendous benefit for that application."

I understand your reservations about hardware fingerprinting and firewall editing, which apply to monolithic systems such as Tails. But you could address these concerns with VMs and a robust hypervisor. 





In Qubes, you could split the wallet and daemon so that your keys are on a (virtually) air-gapped VM for extra security, and the Whonix Gateway would give you the benefit of Tor without firewall editing. That way, you can run a full node over Tor so you don't have to share your private view key with anybody.

Nano, PascalCoin, and MimbleWimble (used by Grin, Beam, Tari) are all great projects, offering better privacy than Bitcoin. And they all scale really well. But I don't think any of them come close to being as fungible as Monero. 




Which Monero pays for with considerable blockchain bloat, I will add. Not only are transactions relatively large, but the need to scan historical blockchain data for transactions means that it can't be easily disposed of. Sure, individual users can prune some data, but it's not like PascalCoin where essentially the entire network can purge everything before the last couple blocks."

tails,ffheek2,t3_etl9pe,1579931840.0,"I can only answer to a couple of those things. 




5) Time has to be standardized in order for Tor to work.





6) I would boot into another Linux system and write every sector of the drive with random data multiple times, then zero out the drive, then put an innocent FAT32 filesystem.




8) What you're thinking of is the Intel Management Engine. Honestly, it's pretty bad. Closed source binary blob, root access to the device, allows for remote control. If I was a 3 letter agency, finding a way to exploit the Intel ME would be my top priority.  There's something similar for AMD; this has been a huge security hole in every x86_64 processor for about a decade




On certain machines you can purge/neuter the Intel ME and replace it with the likes of CoreBoot/LibreBoot. Put it might not be possible on every machine; even if it is it might be a real bitch to flash the ROM; and if something goes wrong there's a chance you might brick your motherboard. 



IF you are feeling up to the challenge, I would recommend you find a machine good with Qubes. Qubes is a little more complicated than Tails; if you are willing to sacrifice the Amnesia quality of Tails (everything is encrypted with LUKS just like your persistence) then I find it more convenient AND more powerful than Tails, once you catch up on the learning curve. Torification is handled by a Whonix Gateway.  Qubes allows you to use multiple Workstations in conjunction with the Gateway (or you can make a virtual machine with no networking whatsoever) so that it allows you to better segregate your activities. 




There's only a few machines that can have the Intel ME purged, flashed with open source BIOS, and support the virtualization capabilities that Qubes needs. The Lenovo T430 and x230 are notable examples of machines that check every box. They're pretty old so you can get them pretty cheap. Keep in mind you'll probably want to stock them with 16 gigs of RAM if you plan to use Qubes.






Finally regarding not being able to understand source code even when it is available; you can at least verify the .iso against the signing key so that you know who you are trusting. That does leave you open to malice/duress/key theft though.

Monero,ffc4wqc,t1_ffc1gjp,1579791602.0,"Like I said I don't mean to make light of anybody's hard work, or take credit for such. I believe that CPU mining is essential for an egalitarian currency. It enables so many potentially revolutionary applications.  I only came up with this nickname because I believe the feature is so important.  





The thing is, when I describe this feature to my friends, they don't know what RPC stands for.  The term RPC Payment is not immediately intuitive for new users.  The application of this feature extends far beyond the cryptocurrency space. It could revolutionize the whole internet.  IMHO the term H2P2 helps to illuminate the applications of such a genius feature of Monero.






When I describe HyperHash Payment Protocol as a means to pay people with Monero hashes, even when you don't have Monero coins, I feel like it clicks with them better.  If the developers disagree with me I will gladly defer to their judgement.  If the inventors of H2P2 take offense to me naming it as such, I would be glad to abandon my use of the term as a token of much-deserved respect. 





I use the term simply because I believe it helps me (personally) spread awareness of this under-appreciated feature. I feel like it was overshadowed by the RandomX algorithm in the last hard fork, and didn't receive the publicity it deserves.     I realize I am but one person, but this particular feature excites me very much, and the acronym helps me explain it better. As I have mentioned in other threads, I  believe this feature is something that makes Monero unique in the cryptocurrency space. (Apart from its focus on trustless privacy.). This showcases the overarching ethos of the Monero community which I am proud to be a part of.






I came up with this acronym (H2P2-HyperHash Payment Protocol) in response to a thread (I believe by gingeropolous) where he suggested that we find a name to promote this awesome new feature.  If you believe that my naming of this feature is a detriment to the promotion of the hard work of the Monero developers, then I offer my sincere apologies.  





When I learned of this new feature, I believed it to be a great step towards increasing the resiliency of the Monero network.  







The last thing I would like to be is someone who detracts from this. If anyone believes I should stop using this term, feel free to message me directly. I'm only trying to help; if my efforts are misguided I will gladly cease and desist."
Monero,ffbqwyb,t1_ffbc987,1579779159.0,"I believe that your analysis contains no logical contradictions and is a valid belief. I do not believe in institutionalized religion. But I do believe in a God who makes his will apparent to those with an open mind. And I believe that God granted me my own mind and conscious to make me free to make my own decisions and accept such consequences. Anyone who says they know for sure what God wants is full of shit. I believe that the wise can come to their own conclusions and act upon them. It is my opinion that God created math, and cryptography, in order to preserve our God-given right to freedom.  Purity of intention is all anyone can ask of you.



You may disagree with me, and that is fine. I am a self-directed American Protestant.  One of my best friends is a Luciferian Satanist. I believe that if one is truly secure in their beliefs that one should not be afraid of hearing out the beliefs of others. For instance, I believe that Luciferians rightfully pay more respect to the welfare of animals than your average Christian. I welcome understanding of the beliefs of others. 





I apologise for being so religious in this post. The point I would like to stress is that I believe an open mind is a sign of strength. I would gladly listen to the beliefs of those that disagree with me.  I do believe in objective right and wrong, but that it cannot be taught. It must be felt in one's bones. The Truth makes itself apparent to those with open minds, even if they don't share all of my beliefs there is common ground between all good peoples. 







I believe that dogs can see into a person's soul; if my dog doesn't like you, fuck you. If my dog likes you, there must be some goodness in your soul. I live my life by this simple metric. Trust your dog.  Seriously"
Monero,ffbdcyb,t1_ffavkib,1579760564.0,It's just something I pulled outta my ass in a thread here asking for nicknames. Not trying to appropriate anyone's hard work; just trying to use a fun acronym. I think it has a ring to it

System76,ffaa8lf,t1_ffa85wn,1579730929.0,"I have asked around on Reddit; the only issue I know of so far is that the backlit keyboard probably won't work without their drivers. My understanding is that Clevo makes the machines but System76 loads them with unique firmware.

Monero,ffa54lu,t1_ffa2r3a,1579728069.0,"Monero's algorithm is optimized for CPU mining. That means practically any consumer device could mine it at least decently well. In theory this includes things like ARM boards and phones. (The hash/watt ratio can be attractive, but the raw hash power is obviously going to be low.)




In the last hard fork, Monero introduced a feature that I have shamelessly taken the liberty of nicknaming the HyperHash Payment Protocol, or H2P2. H2P2 provides a way for node operators to be compensated for offering their services to light wallet users. 





Conceptually it isn't much different from having your own personal mining pool. You want me to serve you the last 5000 blocks of data?  I'm going to need 5 shares that clear a difficulty threshold of 100. You want me to forward this transaction data to the Monero network?  That's gonna be another couple hundred hashes directed towards my address. 




H2P2 is potentially revolutionary because it allows anyone with a CPU, some electricity, and internet to have a means of payment even if cut off from every financial system in the world. 






The proposed radio transmission system allows the need for internet access to be removed from the situation. All the user needs is a consumer CPU and some electricity. 




This is why I am so vehemently anti-ASIC and pro-Monero.  When Bitcoin sold its soul to the devil/Bitmain, so many potentially revolutionary applications of the technology were sacrificed by increasing the barrier to entry for mining"
System76,ffa3y5t,t1_ffa17xw,1579727405.0,"Would you happen to know if that financing option charges interest?




System76 maintains their own Linux distro, called Pop which iirc is a fork of Ubuntu. So some sort of Linux support is guaranteed. 




My concern is that if I run into trouble with Qubes/Xen that I may be on my own"
Monero,ffa3omv,t1_ffa2mb8,1579727254.0,"They definitely do have an advantage in that the same company makes the hardware and software. They have a solid track record in supporting older hardware for a fair amount of time; I've seen Androids essentially abandoned by the manufacturer much faster. 





Their closed-source nature and hostility to 3rd party repairs soured me permanently though. I used to have an iPhone but now I'm using cheap Androids until I can get my hands on a decent Linux phone. The Librem 5 looks promising (and pricey) and the PinePhone looks cheap enough to take a chance on. Even if the PinePhone fails as a daily driver it might be a good idea to keep in the trunk as an emergency phone. I definitely intend to get one of their production models once the public beta is over"
pinephone,ffa32uk,t1_ffa11p8,1579726906.0,The only thing I think you're missing is qrexec for communication between paravirtualized machines. That's a feature that makes a huge difference imo. Without being able to define if/how 2 VMs can talk to each other it makes it a lot harder to use Qubes for certain applications like secure cryptocurrency key management.
