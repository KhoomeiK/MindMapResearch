MurderedByWords,ffe6mdy,t1_ffe60q4,1579838087.0,Why not? Why would you not want to live in a society that functions under the idea that everyone should live comfortably?
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffd5ndf,t1_ffd4oj1,1579813894.0,Making exceptions to define something as important as sex doesn't sound very scientific which is ironic considering your whole basis of defining sex is an appeal to science. But it's okay you have your opinion since as you said you are still respectful to trans people. I believe more light will be shed on the vagueness of sex in the coming years as gender has been over the last decade.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffd406v,t1_ffd2be1,1579812981.0,"But genetics isn't cut and dry. There are people with only one chromosome (x or y) and people with three. There are people who have swyer syndrome, which means they are born with XY chromosomes but everything else about them points to them being a ""woman"". Female genitalia, female looks, etc. You would never think of them as anything other than a XX chromosomal woman unless they told you. 

You cant easily define these people with genetics so the question becomes ""Is sex binary? Do genetics always determine sex?"" The answer to these questions are not as clear cut as we have believed."
todayilearned,ff9o515,t1_ff9jz76,1579717073.0,"Also worth mentioning the combined effort to stop labor movements, particularly black majority unions."
DiWHY,ff9797y,t3_erva17,1579706487.0,"lmao I saw this too. Fort Campbell or East Nashville BST? Weirdest thing about it was the creator claimed to have made pieces for a lot of famous musicians, I think Johnny Cash was one."
cringe,ff7tswg,t1_ff6h1yh,1579658191.0,"It's no different with attractive women and the men that are interested in them. To gender it and imply its just a woman thing is what is so inherently misogynistic and incel-like. It's a non-observarion, totally benign and obvious."
OurPresident,ff6hyrn,t1_ff60s75,1579627596.0,Who has he had that is far left? Abby Martin is the farthest left person I've seen him have on and I wouldn't really consider her far left. I see no auth communists on the podcast.
perfectlycutscreams,ff58c0p,t1_ff4k97w,1579583222.0,"Also a lot of people lose deposits because landlords can just not give it to you. Even at apartments where I caused 0 damage, spent an entire weekend cleaning and spent money on professional carpet cleaning I still did not get more than 50% of my deposit. I had maintenance walk through an apartment, say I'll get 90% of the deposit back then when it comes time to get it I recieved less than ten bucks. This is with before and after photos and detailed lists of prior damage.


Especially in college housing it is almost guaranteed you won't get all your deposit back."

cringe,ff1wwgt,t3_er5lus,1579488039.0,Wow I havent seen this in probably a decade. This is a deep dive classic.
cringe,fezcyd2,t1_fewf8au,1579456031.0,"It actually is or at least was against the rules to post kids. Also against the rules to post videos of one person doing something cringey with no audience, like vlogs and the like. When these rules were created a few years ago it cleaned up the subreddit and the bullies left to make their own cringe subreddits ala cringeanarchy cringetopia etc. 

This sub is much more empathetic than what it once was. The rules were a good move."
Tinder,fewqvqe,t1_fewkzp7,1579418141.0,"I don't think that is much of the point though. It's usually just too try hard and also not very genuine. I mean how many times have variations of this bait have been posted in this sub? It's a set up joke, not humor in real time."
videos,felh7f8,t1_felg5lq,1579222094.0,"I dont think there is anything to get and they aren't ironic, just quirky artists. I dont know what would be seen as insincere. If you dont like it there's no problem with that.

A brief history of them is that they come from all around the world and were once a different band that the singer loved and saw live. She ended up skyping them a lot, becoming friends, and eventually joined the band. I personally love the juxtaposition the singer has with the others."
PublicFreakout,fekxlfz,t1_fekcruj,1579209698.0,"You're misunderstanding why people have the ""punch a nazi"" mindset. It isn't about changing their beliefs, it is about shaming racists and protecting the people they hate. If we allow neonazis to preach openly and only say ""I disagree"" what damage is that doing to POC? Will neonazis become more accepted because there is no true dissent? Will their beliefs become more instilled in society because we allow them to? People that punch nazis believe that it is more important to protect people from these bigots than give them a second chance. It is a valid opinion and IMO we need both nazi punchers and ""talk them out of it"" types to balance our ability to get rid of racists.

Anectodally, as someone who has talked to a handful of neonazis, white supremacists, and proud boys they seem far too gone to be able to change through honest dialogue. What I've heard is incredibly vile and far beyond your casual old white man racism. If most people heard this stuff in real life and were confronted with real neonazis I feel they wouldn't be so kumbaya and ""let's talk it out"". I tried that earnestly and it got nowhere, all it did was made me feel physically sick to hear those opinions. Ruined my mood for a week. People underestimate how easy it is to handle neonazis online or in their heads, it's a whole different ball game when you really confront them in person."
PublicFreakout,fekwpf6,t1_fek4p08,1579209168.0,"The heart of the matter is whether POC should be obligated to change a racist's mind in the first place. It would be great if every person who is discriminated against could use it as a teaching moment about compassion but they shouldn't *have* to. They shouldn't be obligated to or asked to, it is essentially blaming the victim for not being kind enough to someone that hates them.

Is giving racists an even footing in speech and kindness worth the harm, discrimination, harassment and hate they will dish out? 

This is a line we a society with free speech have to walk very finely."
DunderMifflin,feitg97,t1_feio743,1579146762.0,People keep saying they need a third mic and this episode was pretty much proof.
SandersForPresident,fehom1q,t1_fehfhlb,1579120766.0,"Obama has been reported saying he would try to stop a Sanders nomination. The other commenter is right. Social liberties pale in comparison to corporate interests. Clinton, Obama and Trump are all neoliberals, Bernie is not."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fea7exh,t3_eo4df8,1578945234.0,"You guys really lap up this controlled opposition. He said nothing controversial or risky, nothing profound or useful or interesting or insightful. 

It's the same shit you always hear and Hollywood loves it because now that you feel cathartic agreeing with his ""take down"" your guilt of consuming corporate culture and mass media is gone and you can continue to consume it incessantly."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fea6i0e,t1_fe9b78y,1578944911.0,"The translate advice sounds like a cool technique, will try this!"
Tinder,fe9h83k,t1_fe9cqex,1578937559.0,It's better but I think you should still go for a smiling headshot that isnt a selfie. Or at least make it not look like a selfie.
Tinder,fe99cxt,t1_fe9867b,1578935523.0,Need better pictures. Get a headshot where you are smiling and can see your eyes.
sadcringe,fe4gbuw,t1_fe4bnkr,1578859037.0,Jeez that sounds awful. Glad I haven't had that experience yet.
sadcringe,fe3mvez,t1_fe3ko3d,1578850778.0,Oh thanks for the info. I just assumed it was like Tinder.
sadcringe,fe3jjmw,t1_fe373th,1578849808.0,"That sounds weird as hell. I'm 5'8"" and dont put my height in my bio. I've never been asked my height and have success dating. Talking with my girl friends, the ones that don't have some tall guy preference (most don't) find it cringey when guys put their height in their bio. You should just have a picture that naturally shows your relative height (average, tall, short)."
PublicFreakout,fdxqpot,t1_fdxqbx4,1578771922.0,"I mean I'm a socialist too but you cant ignore the benefits of the Nordic model, which is social democracy capitalism."

facepalm,fdh9p3p,t1_fdh8ogv,1578418405.0,Love me some false equivalence.
facepalm,fdgtl28,t1_fdgps4g,1578407984.0,Yes exactly. Other than direct action the way they present themselves to the public is intentionally extremist to move the Overton window on animal rights.
facepalm,fdgteph,t1_fdgsjt8,1578407855.0,You should probably read the snopes article linked in the comment you shared in its entirety because the guy is making an exaggerated claim that his source nearly disproves.

videos,fdeb7xp,t1_fdea4or,1578335221.0,"To you maybe, and that's fine. But the man is considered a comedy legend and The Office is considered one of the greatest comedy shows of all time. So to say his humor falls short of its intention is clearly not true."
MurderedByWords,fcxq2m1,t3_ejcxdt,1578068776.0,The op-ed is just as trash as the headline. A lot of really dubious and exaggerated claims are all over it.
cringe,fcvuwgb,t3_ej0nir,1578010649.0,"That actually is a pretty good description of his comedy style in general. He floats in this weird gray zone between childish scatological humor and anti-comedy where the absurdity itself is the joke. Without him you wouldn't have Eric Andre, Jackass and dozens of others comedians and pranksters. Unironically one of the most influential comedians of the 2000s. Also one of the first ever podcasters."
AmItheAsshole,fcv7iq7,t1_fcv4vow,1577996261.0,"Can you share a source on silicone toys being porous because everything I've read has said otherwise.

You may be confusing silicone with another material, I just tried again to look for a source that says silicone is porous and unsafe without a condom and could not find anything."
MapPorn,fcut3wn,t1_fcukj4j,1577987969.0,I work for a Korean company in the States and we all have to use it so I hear that sound like a hundred times a day. It's a great messaging app otherwise.
AmItheAsshole,fcuqk0z,t1_fcupizf,1577986483.0,I guess I can see that as a mental thing. If I only had toys to use exclusively on women and bought them to use with specific women that could be different.
JusticeServed,fcunn75,t1_fcum3zq,1577984853.0,It's a subreddit based around a popular leftist political comedy podcast. The subreddit is pretty separate from the actual podcast (podcasters have denounced the sub) and is basically 4chan for leftists.
AmItheAsshole,fcum4kq,t1_fcua3xq,1577983976.0,Is that really an issue? Maybe a vibrator is different but I have multiple silicone dildos that I use on myself and partners I've had and none of them have had an issue with using them knowing that they have been used on someone else. It isn't like they are damaged or unclean. When you break up with someone you just throw those toys away?

bestof,fckg71e,t1_fck5nyo,1577724612.0,"I empathize with this sentiment but it is very much the opposite of the MRA type subreddits and I dont see it ever changing. It is 100% feminist and frames mens issues through that lense (ex: how patriarchy is bad for men, how toxic masculinity affects our rights as men, etc.) All the MRAs can do is troll and they would end up failing considering how high the caliber of discussion on MensLib is."
