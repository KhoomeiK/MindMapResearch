entertainment,fcso2n0,t1_fcsn69x,1577920819.0,"This must be a semantic issue owing to the fact that English is not your native language. You specifically stated, ""trying to make a connection to Kevin Spacey is beyond ridiculous. Ari Behn never accused Spacey of anything."" This is patently incorrect and is the point I (accurately) argued against. Ari Behn *accused* Kevin Spacey of grabbing his balls under a table. Any English-language publication could use the word ""accused"" in this context. It does not need to mean that a legal case is officially brought against a person. It's rich of you to suggest that it is **I** who should learn the meaning of the word, since you're the one with the misunderstanding.

In any case, I'm glad we can both agree that Ari Behn ""mentioned once being grabbed by the balls"" by Kevin Spacey. Thanks for confirming!"
entertainment,fcsjqis,t1_fcsicbo,1577917948.0,What? Ari Behn very publicly accused Kevin Spacey of grabbing his balls under a table while they were attending a Nobel Prize concert. This story is very easy to find online if you do even a modicum of research.

I would bet the dog in the video is a mix of similar breeds, but King Charles are a really friendly and intelligent breed. They’re lovely family dogs with typically sweet dispositions."

aww,fcc8mtq,t1_fcc41um,1577595615.0,"What does “*at risk of being* extremely allergic” mean? A person is either allergic or not.

Anyone who is “extremely allergic” to anything as common as dog fur would obviously take precautions such as wiping down surfaces before touching them, **everywhere they go**, because absolutely any surface would pose a contamination risk. Dogs are everywhere in the world and anyone with a severe allergy to them would be well-versed in avoiding contamination. Even dog fur on another person’s clothing, which then falls onto a shopping trolley or other common surface, would be a risk. Or are you not truly thinking of the reality of extreme allergies and are instead just talking out of your ass and jumping on this ridiculous outrage bandwagon?"
