And this is simply not true. The total world debt is owed to many people/entities. The U.S. has a debt of more than $22 trillion, approximately zero of which is owed to the IMF (quite the contrary, we're the largest lending member of the IMF). Most debt is owed to bond-holders and nation-to-nation borrowing.
