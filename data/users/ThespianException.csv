whowouldwin,ffk0t3k,t1_ffk00oi,1580012335.0,It seems this fight is a bit more one sided than I imagined. If Count Dooku joined the brothers would that be more fair or would it be too much do you think? Perhaps General Grievous if Dooku swings the fight too far in the other direction.
whowouldwin,ffk0q2g,t1_ffjz361,1580012263.0,For rounds 3 and 4 if Count Dooku or maybe Grievous was added to the brothers side do you think that would be too one sided or would Vader still win?
whowouldwin,ffk0go3,t3_etttpj,1580012041.0,"Short Faced Bears are effectively bigger, stronger brown bears IIRC. With that in mind they clear through 6 easily. Siberian tigers have been known to prey on smaller brown bears though that's with surprise attacks and not head on. Head on I'm told the battle ends up being pretty close, and with a SF Bear being bigger than a brown bear it should consistently win. 

R8 is like 7 but closer, however I still think the bear would win. It would win 9 and 10 fairly easily as well, being that Crocodiles suck on land and polar bears are less thicc from what I recall.

I don't think it could reliably win against a hippo. Maybe achieve a pyrrhic victory occasionally but not often. The Bear stops at 11."

The Slayer was blessed by the angels but I think they are an entirely different group than the Night Sentinels. That said they seem to be together in this picture, so it's possible that they are working together and the Slayer is opposing both. 

The [Wiki Page for the Night Sentinels](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Night_Sentinels) has more info, though some of it is speculation (we saw some of them saluting the Slayer so it's not clear if they're all enemies or if maybe some of them are)."

Of course video games are art just like any other form of entertainment or expression, but art never has and never will be immune to criticism. If anything it invites it even more than other products. Movies probably get more flack then even games and I've seen many complaints levied against certain albums from good artists.

Futurology,fdlpny0,t1_fdldl6p,1578529510.0,"Here's the thing, you're speaking on an individual level. You're trying to convince individuals to change their lifestyle. The person you responded to earlier is talking about changing society as a whole, getting millions or billions to change your lifestyle. 

The fact of the matter is that you or I or any other individual will make almost no impact whatsoever on the planet by going vegan. An individual is entirely irrelevant to the scale of the issue, you could actively try to fuck the planet as much as you can and you would still likely make a negligible impact.  

If you want to actually help animals and plants and the planet then focusing on getting lots of people to change is how you actually do something noteworthy. Society will not change unless you give the average consumer ""QuAlItY AnD AfForDaBlE PrOduCtz"". If people haven't switched to better products then the products aren't good enough and need to be better. That is the half of the equation you can change, you can't change people being ""selfish"" or ""egotistical"" and trying isn't doing anyone any good. It sucks but that's what reality is."
Futurology,fdlorcn,t1_fdldaa2,1578528894.0,"It's not about shame, its that YOU are directly harming your cause by taking an aggressive stance. You are scaring people away from veganism, and frankly in doing so are probably harming the planet more than someone that eats meat.

 Let me ask you a question: What's your goal here with these comments? If you're actually trying to get people to stop eating meat then you should stop and think about human psychology for a minute. Berating people for having views *doesn't change their views*. I get that you're upset about people seemingly being apathetic to something you care about but if you're trying to actually make a difference then this isn't the way to do it. On the other hand if you're just trying to feel superior to people because they eat meat and you don't then you're doing fine I guess, at the cost of the reputation of veganism.

I'm certain it makes you feel better, because you're ""Spreading the truth"", but in doing that the only real effect you're having on others is pissing them off and turning them from your lifestyle. That's not making a positive change, it's making a negative one. Almost no one's ever been convinced by the people saying stuff like this, they've been convinced by the documentaries and such that actually show the positives of the lifestyle and offer people the chance to adopt it instead of commanding them to."

The fuck does that even mean? They provided an example and there are a ton of others. Renewable energy isn't starting to replace coal and oil because people feel bad, its starting to replace them because it's becoming cheaper and easier. People wanting to help the environment is part of the push but if that was the only factor we'd have replaced fossil fuels decades ago."

If anything it invites it even more than other products. Movies probably get more flack then even games and I've seen many complaints levied against certain albums from good artists.

The person you responded to earlier is talking about changing society as a whole, getting millions or billions to change your lifestyle. 

The fact of the matter is that you or I or any other individual will make almost no impact whatsoever on the planet by going vegan. An individual is entirely irrelevant to the scale of the issue, you could actively try to fuck the planet as much as you can and you would still likely make a negligible impact.  

If you want to actually help animals and plants and the planet then focusing on getting lots of people to change is how you actually do something noteworthy. Society will not change unless you give the average consumer ""QuAlItY AnD AfForDaBlE PrOduCtz"". If people haven't switched to better products then the products aren't good enough and need to be better. That is the half of the equation you can change, you can't change people being ""selfish"" or ""egotistical"" and trying isn't doing anyone any good. It sucks but that's what reality is."
Futurology,fdlorcn,t1_fdldaa2,1578528894.0,"It's not about shame, its that YOU are directly harming your cause by taking an aggressive stance. You are scaring people away from veganism, and frankly in doing so are probably harming the planet more than someone that eats meat.

 Let me ask you a question: What's your goal here with these comments? If you're actually trying to get people to stop eating meat then you should stop and think about human psychology for a minute. Berating people for having views *doesn't change their views*. I get that you're upset about people seemingly being apathetic to something you care about but if you're trying to actually make a difference then this isn't the way to do it. On the other hand if you're just trying to feel superior to people because they eat meat and you don't then you're doing fine I guess, at the cost of the reputation of veganism.

You can blame other people for not trying hard enough all you like, but you aren't convincing anyone to actually try harder."

I'm certain it makes you feel better, because you're ""Spreading the truth"", but in doing that the only real effect you're having on others is pissing them off and turning them from your lifestyle. That's not making a positive change, it's making a negative one. Almost no one's ever been convinced by the people saying stuff like this, they've been convinced by the documentaries and such that actually show the positives of the lifestyle and offer people the chance to adopt it instead of commanding them to."

The fuck does that even mean? They provided an example and there are a ton of others.

People wanting to help the environment is part of the push but if that was the only factor we'd have replaced fossil fuels decades ago."

Futurology,fdkn64c,t1_fdjkmk3,1578507045.0,"Suggestions like that don't really help though. Sure, in a perfect world no one would eat animals, but the reality of the situation is that it's not actually feasible. No matter how much people tell you most of the population isn't going to stop eating meat or using animal products. 

It's like telling people to carry their own water bottle instead of buying disposable plastic ones, good idea on a personal scale but it's not actually going to fix the real issue because most people won't do it. Sometimes you forget, sometimes you don't want to carry a bottle all day, sometimes you only want one for a few minutes and you want to throw it away after. Or telling teens to just not have sex instead of telling them to have safe sex. Obviously we've seen very well how that actually ends up going. Feasible for some but clearly not a real solution for teen pregnancy. 

People use what's convenient, enjoyable, and easy. If you want to actually make a large-scale change then you need to make the solution better than the problem. Giving stuff up is about as far from those things as you can get."
