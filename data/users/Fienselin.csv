That way he doesnt have to keep on being all embarrassed and stuff. Life would be so much easier sometimes if some people would just admit they were wrong once in a while..."

Not everyone on meth is acting that way. Is it some type of Tourette syndrom or could it be even be more severe, like some kind of psychotic episode? Because she is like barely responding to anything the staff is saying."

I wouldn't describe them as zombies but they are indeed faceless, but I always do know who they are. I just think my imagination wants to show someone and I always know exactly which person it is but maybe it has trouble recalling faces from imagination."

I will help cleaning, I'm pretty quiet until I'm not (mostly when I'm telling weird stories I get loud so just don't let me tell stories). I can cook, I do have small selection of vinyl AND I will just go for a walk during your lovemakings. Or just stand in the doorway, staring at you. Just whatever you guys prefer. Oeh and can we have a dog? 

Let me know, thanks in advance!"

AskReddit,fecxpne,t1_fecx083,1578988867.0,"It's not like women spread that stuff all around the planet and definitely when you have a micropenis, that's way different than a small penis and if someone would tell me about it confidentially I would definitely not spread that. It's also BS that if you have a big one, a whole girl friendgroup wants to take a turn on you. We have a life you know? Not everything is about penises... 

And yes if you tell a girl you have a micropenis, you might not get laid, but wouldn't you rather tell a girl and see if she response nicely and say like: I like you as you are and let's just give it a try. Or don't tell, go sleep with her, it scares and confuses the shit out of her and she won't return your call ever again afterwards? It think a micropenis is definitely a more serious condition than a small penis and as a guy I would be really scared of losing people I really like because I kept it a secret. If you scare people of by telling it on the first date, they most definitely are not the right person to trust and be with."

I used to work in this drugstore in the Netherlands and you can buy morning after pills in the drugstore without prescriptions, which is great. 

Once 2 girls walked in the store and were staring at our products. So I asked if I could help them and then this one girl asked me how much the morning after pill costs. So I tell her 12,95 euros. And she's like: 12,95 FOR ONE PILL???? And then her friend said: if I were you, I shouldn't do it... It's so expensive!!!

First of all: great friend. Second: go check out how much the diapers costs, girl. Cause you're going to need loads of those."

You shouldn't have to worry about medical bills when you need medical help. It's really shit that, when you have a serious disease, you need to choose if you 1) don't take any treatment and maybe die, 2) have treatment, maybe survive but be bankrupt, 3) take treatment, maybe die and maybe give you medical debts to family I pressure."
