He has never *once* treated me differently, never ever makes me feel bad about my weight, and has always supported me through my depression. A history of adult acne runs in my family, and he’s never said anything about my face that wasn’t positive. I’ve recently started a strict self care plan, and he has 100% supported me in learning how to cook healthier meals and exercise, but the focus of that is health, not my appearance. You did the right thing, no matter how depressed you are or how hard life is, he should know better than to tear you down over his insecurities. You deserve better, and I’d definitely cut all contact with him. You don’t owe him anything."
relationships,ffdbq9m,t3_eszuki,1579817469.0,"I’m in a happy open relationship. Feelings of jealousy are normal, it’s how you process it that matters. There’s definitely an adjustment period, because monogamy is pretty ingrained into our culture, and we’re told at a young age that romantic love is only real between 2 exclusive people. Normal human emotions don’t just go away because you’ve made the decision to
explore polyamory. It *isn’t* for everyone though, so you’re going to have to take an honest inventory of yourself and your needs/who you are. It’s totally ok to be monogamous, the most important thing is that you’re happy and being true to yourself. I’d check out r/polyamory, and r/nonmonogamy, they have some really good links to sources and reading materials that can help you decide what’s right for you. It’s great that you guys have this far been open with each other, but if you can’t healthily work through your jealousy it’s not gonna be good for you or her.
Edited to add: I do *lightweight* agree with the other comment about her making out over your objections, I never would’ve done that to my husband. But I can see how she might feel that you saying that was hypocritical, since you had had two partners before that with no objections to poly."

There are also things specifically designed to blow the smoke through to NOT make it smell like cannabis smoke. His total disregard for your profession alone is enough to leave him, the fact that he’s putting smoking weed before your physical health and comfort is disgusting. My husband works for Union Pacific Railroad and can’t smoke, he doesn’t mind the small amount of smell (oil only really smells when you blow it out, and faintly) but I STILL always make sure it’s not around him. It’s not hard to go outside, cigarette smokers have been doing it forever. The fact that he hotboxes your room is juvenile in itself, only teenagers and people in movies do that shit, because it’s mostly for novelty. He should know by now that adult responsibilities come before recreational activities, and putting your job at risk just to satisfy that stupid heady stoner shit is a deal breaker."

>I have no one and nothing without her


This is not okay. The fact that you’re placing your happiness solely on her is a huuuuge responsibility, and is probably why she is distancing herself. She probably needs some space, and I’m sorry if this comes across harshly, but you need to focus on bettering yourself, for yourself."

Managing depression is a full time job, and she (or you) may not be emotionally able to handle a relationship on top of that until you are sorted out on the basics. Self care, good eating habits, and exercising regularly are all super important. I know it sound simple and basic, but that along with medication has shown the most improvement for myself personally. I would also look into practicing Mindfullness/Meditation, there’s pretty solid science behind the effectiveness of that. I also personally do “Challenging negative thoughts/self talk” activities on a pretty regular basis. [This](https://imgur.com/a/1dBtkq3) is an Imagur link to my personal care plan, and a couple resource pages that I used to make it.

He would say he wasn’t available to hang out, and then a short time later flip flop and say he actually could. We’d only ever hang out in my house, and rarely go anywhere else. Eventually we were drinking and I straight up asked him if he was cheating on someone (I have anxiety, I def should’ve outwardly asked sooner but I didn’t know if I was over reacting). He ended up kind of half assedly saying “not reaally?”. I asked him “If she knew you were here, would she say you were cheating?” And he said yeah.

jeffreestarcosmetics,fe0c4yw,t3_enjuh2,1578809377.0,"Practice makes perfect!! Tbh for this I would’ve used some scotch tape as a guard to create a sharp diagonal line (similar to a cats eye) for more drama. Don’t be discouraged, I’ve been doing my make up since middle school and I’m 25 now, but I’m constantly learning new techniques for my face/eye shape. You got this, and it’s def worth it to invest in good products/tools for the best results. Edited to add: I also think your crease could use some dimension. Try using at least 2-3 colors for your crease every time, a light transition color at first, then blend in a slightly darker color to the middle of your crease, and a very dark shade for the outer V of your eye. This look could’ve done nicely with a cut crease to make that pink on the lid pop. Hope that helps/makes sense lol"

I’d always joke around that he looked like a douchey dickhead, but it’s totally normal to post those videos if you’re into fitness. It’s good to see your posture and all that, and I don’t really see how it would be any different then all the bullshit other people post (like makeup selfies, or any other hobby). I think your friend over reacted, he could’ve just unfollowed you and called it a day rather than berating you for a joke. NTA."

D&D is a really fun way to meet people, and it’s a consistent thing to do every week. They also show stuff like dancing lessons/meet ups, which sounds kind of dumb but is also a great way to meet people (and girls). Is there any way to go no contact with your family?"

Makeup,fdoch6w,t3_emeskz,1578602660.0,"I use micellar water, it doesn’t have the preservatives that makeup wipes have, and actually cleans rather than pushing the product around your face. Witch Hazel is an astringent, and not meant to remove makeup."

femalehairadvice,fdj0rfq,t3_elmv1b,1578455519.0,"Personally, I like the middle color. It’s fun, but it’s not as high maintenance as the last color. If you choose the last color, you’re looking at (at least) 2-3 bleaches BEFORE You color to get your hair light enough for a pastel color (I’d guess more than that tbh tho since your hair is so dark naturally, like 4 or 5). To not COMPLETELY fry your hair, you’re also gonna need to space those bleaches out, the longer the better but at least 3 weeks in between. You’re going to go through the bleach phases, which rarely look cute at first (expect some orange ass hair). Do not use box bleach kits, the best thing to do for the last color is go professional. If you decide to try it at home anyway, DO NOT go over 30 developer, and DO NOT use quick blue powder (also never start at the roots, bleach develops faster there because of the natural heat on your head). Good luck 
Edited to add: if your hair is virgin and has never been colored, you may be looking at less on the bleach, but it’s still gonna take some time"

Next time he says you’re ugly, tell him you agree, you were an absolutely hideous girl, so it’s a good thing you’re such a handsome man now.

You don’t get to grovel to stay with someone AND get to keep the person you cheated with around(whether it be emotionally or physically). She fucked up, she knew she fucked up, otherwise the convo/vacation would never have happened. Don’t let her do this to you, you don’t deserve it and neither does your daughter."

If she has kittens, they will prob be given away at the appropriate age. Cats aren’t pack animals. They can form social groups in domestic feral cats (depending on their personalities) but it isn’t a necessity like it is in dogs or wolves. In the wild, cat families only stay together until a certain maturity in the offspring, and then they part. They’re solitary animals.  You don’t seem like you know much about animals."

You can’t really get mad at her for exchanging nudes with someone before you guys even met, just because you’re FWB with someone or have hooked up with them before doesn’t mean you can’t legitimately be friends after that. If she actually gave you a reason and she was cheating whatever, but you went through her messages and violated her privacy for no real reason.
