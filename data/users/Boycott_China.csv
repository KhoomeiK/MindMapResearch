Like, if every time someone got sick, they had to wait 7 months to see a doctor, there'd be riots in the street. You ever even hear of a Canadian riot? No. Why? Because these ""long waits"" of Canadian health care is a lie.

In reality, Americans would pay less money to put everyone on medicare than they currently spend covering not-everyone AND making everyone with coverage pay obscene amounts for it. You'd see the doctor you want and instead of sending the money to some asshole insurance company and begging them to cover your surgery, you'd just pay your taxes like everybody else and when you get sick, you go to the doctor and worry about being sick, not worry about how to pay for it.

Use the churches as community centers to get to know each other, have methodist picnics, put on plays, whatever your people are in to.

Instead, religion will be 100% community service. You will worship me by insisting and ensuring every person has somewhere to live, something healthy to eat, medicine when they're sick, and some way to contribute if they're able -- and all of the aforementioned if they cannot and, frankly, even if they won't. Even the bad people. Even the lazy. Even the criminals.

There's no point to letting people starve or be homeless. It's pointless cruelty just to try and keep the rest of the worker bees in line. There's no point making prison a bad place. Instead, make it a place where the prisoners can actually get better. You're gonna take away part of their life, the one thing they have?

Kind of a long read.

Pertinent part. Just one aspect of government expense (aka not all the money we'd save by doing this) would cost $1.4 trillion and raise $108 billion in GDP annually. That's per year, just for the first decade, and just the direct effects on GDP.

Then you have to add in the economic effects of home ownership for the millions of millennials (and others) who currently spend their potential mortgage payments reimbursing some bank for a loan the bank never actually made with money the bank never actually had to loan in the first place.

Oh, and remember that birth crunch we're facing? Too few new workers to keep the Social Security coffers stocked when millennials start retiring in 30+ years. Cancelling student debt means more babies because currently broke people who won't have kids WILL have kids when they're not drowning in student loan debt.

Then you have to figure the health costs of high debt, all of which go down when the debt disappears.

The Lions offense with Stafford was top-5 this year, and that's without all the pieces clicking together.

The defense was awful, but nowhere near as bad as the results. Their defense is designed like a police cordon. All 11 guys have to be in the right spot, doing the right thing, reading and reacting in the same way on every play. One screw-up doesn't just expose the team to, say, a 15 yard completion. It opens up the team to a big play, a TD given up.

It's a complex defense to learn, but once you've got it down, it's very hard for even the best offenses to crack it repeatedly. That's why I think the Lions are going to go for a veteran LB and interior lineman to bring a pass rush (veterans with experience in the scheme), and use the top of their draft to add a day-one playmaker in the secondary, an offensive lineman, and a WR/weapon. If they trade down from #3, almost anything's possible for that extra pick, including another pass rusher (bit of a project perhaps).

Anyway, they do something like that and they're looking at a playoff spot despite looking like dog poo most of the last half of the year."

Trump insisted on being a dictator who hates dissent and democracy. 

The Republicans who said ""fuck that"" aren't Republicans anymore.  
The Republicans who prefer a dictator to a Constitutional Republic are still Republicans.

End result of basic math: The Republican Party is a lot smaller but much more unified."

My parents are retired but every time they pull their narcissistic BS now, instead of reacting, I just picture them as toddlers throwing a temper tantrum. It makes me chuckle and smile, which confuses the hell out of them.

Obviously don't do this if you're young or vulnerable or dependent on your narcissists for whatever reason. I can piss my Ns off and then go home. Not everyone is in that position, and I just wanted to be clear that I wasn't encouraging anyone to make their situation worse just to laugh at their asshole parents."
