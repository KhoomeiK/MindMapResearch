God isn't located in any one place (but is present in all places). It definitely made sense for Rome to be the ""capitol"" church since it was the capitol city of the empire. Now that by the end of the fourth city there were four other such ""capitols"", with time being the main one. 

To keep going with that analogy, it would be like if America, instead of having a separate federal governmen,t decided that it just had states but the governor of Maryland had certain responsibilities regarding the country as a whole (but Constantinople was co-capitol with Rome by then)

It was later that Rome became more like the federal government, and I obviously believe that to be problematic."
