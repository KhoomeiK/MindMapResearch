ufc,ff16nlk,t3_er409v,1579475751.0,"Nick diaz vs paul Daley,  one of the best 1 round fights ever.  

Elbows cannot go in a vertical direction from straight up to straight down or be aimed at the back of the head.  That's the elbow rules. 

Fighters are always pulling out of fights injured or transported to hospital after fights,  but athletic commissions  that sanction fights have doctors check the fighters and rules about how long you have to wait till you can fight after being knocked out. Every ufc event sees injured fighters receive medical suspensions from athletic commissions overseeing the event.
No ufc deaths so far.
