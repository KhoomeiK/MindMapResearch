Meanwhile too many people are focused on issues that in reality concern a minuscule amount of the population while other issues like the endless cycle of death that fills our cities continues to just be ignored.

To me CW is the best Star Wars ever made besides the original trilogies. Anakin isn’t annoying, all the Clones have personality, Obi-Wan is awesome, plus Yoda, Maul, Ahsoka and my favorites Hondo and Asajj Ventress who I think is  the best character of the series."

MadeMeSmile,ffqh7yg,t3_eumqtg,1580134513.0,"I remember when I was in school there was the very poor boy in my class. His father was a hard worker but was just a simple laborer, he was older and had been in WW2 and had some serious PTSD which I think is why he couldn’t hold down a good job. He was very strict and couldn’t afford to spend money for birthday presents for other kids or even his own son. I went over to his house once and the boy had maybe three toys: a Tonka truck, his favorite book and a short hot wheels track with the two included cars. 

I remember inviting him to my birthday and I told him I just wanted him to come that I didn’t need a present. Well when I was opening presents he got up and handed me a package wrapped with a piece of fabric and a string. He had a nervous smile and was eager but also a bit embarrassed maybe. I opened it and inside was his favorite book. I went crazy. I made a huge deal about it to the point where the other kids began to think I was stupid because it was obviously a used and frankly smeared with dirty kid fingerprints kids book. The other kids had brought expensive Star Wars and G.I. Joe vehicles. I didn’t care. I knew what the book meant to him and made sure to let him know I knew it too. 

He invited me to his birthday party later that year which was his parents letting him have two friends over at once, me and another boy. Both of our parents knew the boys situation and we came with a really cool presents. Not a lot but a couple things that cost more then we would have spent for another kid. I remember I got him this Evel Kneival motorcycle stunt toy that you put on this stand and it shot the bike and figure out and it did some crazy stunts and also this massive steel Tonka Tractor Trailer with  three different vehicles on the back. I remember we all played out in the dirt building ramps to jump the trucks over. He had a smile on his face the entire time. I know that my mom who volunteered at school quite a bit always made sure to pick extra food for him and to have an extra shirt or pair of pants for him to take home. We weren’t rich by any means but my mother knew that his family often didn’t have money for food and she was quick to discretely make sure he always had a lunch. I remember even driving to his home on Christmas Eve to bring them a turkey and full course dinner. I consider myself fortunate to have had parents who had a strong sense of community and a servants attitude toward helping which they have instilled in me. It truly is a wonderful experience to share the gifts you have with others, especially those who are less fortunate. I think about that boy and his family from time to time and I often wonder where he is now. I’ve looked online but have never found him."

Instead of talking climate change which just brings up discussion and talk rather then action, let’s focus on helping people like Boyan Slat who has devised a system and method for cleaning up the trash. Or finding a new type of biodegradable packaging to replace plastics. Or figuring out how to reuse the plastics that we already have piling up everywhere. 

We need to get back to the mindset of the people during WW2 where they would reuse and save everything they could. My great grandmother would reuse a single piece of plastic wrap half a dozen times and rarely wasted anything that entered her home. 

Though those of us not in Asia are only a small part of the issue. To have real change we need India and China to become more ecologically responsible and be leaders in the call for recycling, clean up, and especially climate change.

It is very strange how people act after being helped or rescued sometimes. I have one very strange and upsetting story that highlights this quite well. I remember I pulled into my parking spot at work and then looked up just in time to see a teenage girl somehow flip her mom’s Honda Accord three times in a 45 MPH straight away. Aside from being impressed by the seemingly impossible automotive acrobatics, I jumped out of my car and ran over to find her in the upside down car which had now started to catch fire. She was confused and concussed when I got there, just sitting in the seat in total shock with eyes like a deer in headlights. She had some lacerations in her arms and face from I’m guessing the airbag or projectiles inside the car but otherwise she was visibly unhurt. I crawled in and unbuckled her and helped her right herself. As I walked her to safety she burst into tears. This wasn’t some heroic rescue as the car is about to blow up, the fire had only really started to spread to the rest of the car after we were well out and safe. A second person ran up and asked if things were okay and I just told them to dial 911 which then did. She was crying and saying “my moms going to kill me, she’s going to be so mad” and I told her that her mother would be happy to know she was safe and that the insurance would take care of the car. Nothing I said would calm her and she was starting to develop a full blown panic attack. She tried to run back over to the car as if she could put the fire out or flip it over. She was totally irrational so in an attempt to ease her panic I said let’s call your mother and you’ll see that she’ll be glad your fine. She said okay and I asked her for the number. Her mother answered and I explained that her daughter had been in an accident but she seemed fine and should probably see the paramedics. Before I could finish my sentence she screamed at me “what about my car!?!?” 

I turned away from her daughter hoping she wouldn’t hear that she was right all along, that her shallow horrible mother did care more about a 10 year old Honda then her daughter. I said excuse me miss but I think you have your priorities mixed up. Your daughter should be your main and ONLY concern to which she asked for me to put her on the phone. So I did and instantly regretted it. I could easily hear the screaming and cussing as she berated her daughter who just crumbled to the ground like a sheet crying and repeatedly saying I’m sorry over and over. I took the phone back and proceeded to try to talk some sense into this woman because her daughter was obviously traumatized and needed to hear her say it’s alright. And what does she say to me? “I’ve got lots of daughters but only one car, the f*** I need her for?!?” And hung up. 

Yeah. I felt so sorry for the girl. I gave her my name and phone number and told her if she needed to talk or my statement for insurance or something to call me. She said she would. The paramedics got there and I went to work. I never heard from her. I’m just glad she didn’t hear her “mother” say that last sentence though based off that encounter it’s a safe bet that this woman has said far worse to her face."

To me it’s frustrating that many people, especially politicians see the issue as strictly a race issue. To me its just a people issue. Over the last 70 or 80 years there has been a disintegration in the teaching of basic human values and respect for each other. Too often you hear people criticizing a person who goes into an affected community to try to help if they aren’t the right “color” or are from the wrong demographic. This undermines the will of the people who just want to help and you see that soon no one is going into theses communities to help or mentor. It shouldn’t matter where the help comes from or from who. The more that people try to separate us as “not the same” just because we have a different background or look different then others, the more it erodes the feeling of us all just being people. What makes someone “white” or “black” or “brown”? I mean if we all go back far enough we all have white, black and brown in us.

DoesAnybodyElse,ffpisns,t1_ffmitnp,1580096053.0,"One thing that might help is to read stories about people who have overcome major obstacles in the life. You really can’t appreciate the things you have in life until they’re gone. By seeing others who have been through some major stuff you will gain an appreciation for the things in life that you might not realize are true gifts. It takes an epiphany of sorts to transform your thinking. Sometimes it’s you yourself going though something difficult or sometimes it can be an acceptance and realization of things and make a conscious effort to change.

I myself went through some major stuff. I died twice and have been left with multiple different types of severe chronic pain and disability. For some reason I have never had a negative or bitter attitude about what happened. In fact I feel that despite the immense pain I deal with every day, it was a great thing to happen to me. I was working 100 hour weeks and never saw my 2 young children. But after I became disabled I was able to be home to see my children grow up and I was able to be a major part of their life compared to the little bit of time I had with them while working. Everyone has issues and there are people who are going through stuff that is far worse then what I am dealing with. I always make it a point to be happy and appreciate the things that I DO have rather then focus on the things that I do NOT. I don’t believe that I properly appreciated my life and the things that I took for granted. It’s only natural for us to be that way I guess but once you have the veil drawn back and can see the gifts you truly have I feel you become more honest with yourself. 

I will take a moment to overthink it a bit for you. Imagine yourself in the shoes of someone who lived the life of a king about 500 years ago.  Now imagine that you then brought them to even the most meager of homes today. They would be awestruck and dumbfounded with the things that we have at our fingertips. Think about it, the typical average joe has access to MASSIVE amounts of food without having to raise and care for livestock, we have refrigerators to keep our food from spoiling, the food we have is free of disease and vermin, every piece of information we could need is at our fingertips, we have a television that puts us into totally different worlds without us ever having to leave our homes, clean water at the flick of a wrist, illumination and warmth without the need to chop wood or make fire, safety and shelter from beasts and enemy armies, toilets and showers inside our homes, access to nearly every piece of art, literature and music ever made and finally modern medicine that propels our average lifespan far past that of even the healthiest of person back then. There probably isn’t an emperor or king from that time period that wouldn’t trade most of their kingdom for even one of those things I listed yet we take all of them for granted because we have never had to experience the struggles of someone from 500 years ago. It’s not our fault for being born into privilege but it is important for us to understand how privileged we have all become compare to 500 years ago. Or even 50 years ago in some cases! 

Sorry for the long reply but I hope this brings some perspective to you and let’s you get past the everyday problems to appreciate what you truly have."
MadeMeSmile,ffmhq6i,t1_fflojx9,1580054793.0,"Could you be more specific? While I’m not quite sure of what an example of this would be it is unfortunately safe to say that these children who have grown up in homes where they have no father or mother who cares whether they are doing the right thing, have little sense of family OR community. These children need mentors who have prevailed despite their hardships to show them that they have the potential to be whatever they set their mind to. In most cases that is the job of the mother and/or father but many of these kids don’t have a parent who is able or present to fill that role. Whether that be because they are working three jobs and raising kids alone, are in jail, hooked on drugs, have no clue how to be a parent because they grew up the same way or God forbid they are dead. Whatever the case, when the family is not present it is the responsibility of all of us in the community to step up and fulfill that role and that is what this officer is doing."
MadeMeSmile,ffmfsrs,t1_ffln314,1580054078.0,Thank you as well.

MadeMeSmile,fflgnfj,t3_eu1hbc,1580039499.0,"The death of the family mentality is one major reason why we see so many young men and boys killed or in jail today. It’s frustrating to see youngsters taught to fear the police when they can be strong role models and provide positive interaction that many of these kids sorely need. This is why the gang life is so appealing. It fulfills their dream of being loved in a family. 

Having an officer be a father figure like this will surely help give these boys a sense of self respect and a desire to not disappoint him. The roots he sows now with these boys will go a long way when they get older and are put into difficult positions they at least have someone who cares about them and how they turn out."

A squirrel farts in my front yard and my dog gives about the same reaction to it as if Marines destroyed a technical in MY front yard. I’d love to just see how jaded all the typical “skittish” animals are in Afghanistan and Iraq.

lego,ffjhkkl,t1_ff3yrtr,1579998385.0,"Common man, my entire childhood was spent on telling my little brother what piece I needed as we both crunched our hands through our collection of a billion pieces. My mother always marveled how my little brother understood what piece I needed from my description which must have sounded like backward ancient Sumerian to her. 

About twenty years ago I took all the LEGO sets I could find from my mothers house and spent an entire week trying to complete as many sets as I could. Try finding a very rare particular element from inside 30 Rubbermaid bins filled to the brim! I had to build 8 or 9 sets at a time because it took so long to find an element. I would build up until I hit something hard to find and start a new one and repeat the process. Over time I’d have a top 10 list of elements I’d need. Was only able to build about 40 sets which didn’t even make a dent though did manage to build many of my favorite classic space and castle sets. I need to have a LEGO building party and have 20 people over to help me build all the sets."

AliceInChains,ffizw6t,t3_ett3e7,1579986858.0,"They wrote and recorded this EP in something like 5 days or something crazy. This is a MASTERPIECE. Alice In Chains is the only band that successfully had two identities: a heavy metal grunge band and an acoustic space rock band. Somehow both sides were equally popular and well written.

I was finally able to see them in concert last year after attempting to see them twice before. For 25 years all I wanted was to hear Nutshell live and when they played it I was almost brought to tears. Such an amazing song from an amazing album."

MarvelPuzzleQuest,fffkqn0,t1_fff3tg5,1579886076.0,"To clarify I’m on iOS. I wasn’t picturing it being part of the drop down roster but more of something that was simply six radio buttons for each of the colors. I’m not a coder so I have no idea how difficult it would be but it would be nice to see see which characters share color characteristics. 

Really the place that you need to see what colors you have is on the team selection page. When you see the three characters it would be nice to see a small color swab above their name that shows what colors they are using.

I understand the synergy concept and color overlapping teams but I enjoy experimenting with substitutions and I would like to be able to see  what colors I have on a character without having to click out of my pre-fight page when I search for a potential substitute. 

I’ve been playing since 2014 and have enjoyed all the changes and features that have been added since then. Of course there are some features that would be nice to see but I understand these things take time. 

Now that I think of it, one other feature that would be nice to have would be the ability to see how many shards all of your characters have. You know when you click the ? symbol on the recruit pages you can see how many shards your selected characters have? An option just like that but one that shows ALL of the characters shard, not just favorited would be awesome. 

Also any chance of getting an ISO to gold or Red ISO conversion option? I’ve got close to million ISO and nowhere to put it. 

Just a few suggestions. Thanks for keeping the game fresh."

racism,fff0m6q,t3_eszkum,1579872370.0,"I have seen plenty of cases where people of multiple different races have tried to deposit fake checks and had the same thing happen. How the band employees reacted was the way they were trained to when someone tries to pass a fake check. They try to keep the person unaware they are on to them in order to be able to apprehend the individual. The fact that it was an error is what makes this situation seem extreme but when your bank is able to stop identity thieves and check scammers then that’s a big win. 

I do feel that this gentleman gives the appearance to be quick to accuse racial discrimination based upon the fact that he had a previous incident. I would be curious to know the details behind that. To me when someone accuses someone of racism for things that really aren’t they are behaving like the boy who cried wolf. People won’t take true blatant cases of racism as serious because they are tired of hearing about all of the trigger happy knee jerk reactionary people who accuse without merit. This case could be a legit one or it could be that this mans instinctive reaction is to feel he is being discriminated against. Just because someone feel that they are being discriminated against doesn’t mean they always are. Sometimes the service is just that bad, the employee is just that incompetent or they happen to treat everyone equally crappy. Never assume malicious intent when stupidity is the clear and obvious reason."
racism,ffez0uz,t3_eszkum,1579870925.0,Well now he has two of them! Maybe go for the trifecta when he goes to deposit those?
StarWars,ffeyvqc,t1_ffei8mh,1579870794.0,"Yeah such an “amazing” character! Surprised they didn’t put Holdo and Rose in the top ten with Kathleen Kennedy as number one! 

To me all of the New Hope main characters should be the top 10. Arrange it how you will but they would be: (in no particular order) Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, C-3P0, R2-D2, Vader, Obi-Wan

Maybe add Palpatine in the top 10. 

Next would be 11-20 level characters like: Lando, Grand Moff Tarkin, Boba Fett, Darth Maul, Padme, Anakin (if you don’t count him as Vader. I do), Yoda, Qui-Gon, maybe even add Ahsoka and Ventress here as well. 

The droid from Solo wouldn’t even crack my top 200 list. Horrible, annoying or just extremely minor characters that I would post before it are: Jar Jar, Wilrow Hood (ice cream maker guy!) every clone that had a name in Clone Wars, Stinky, every Gungan to ever be on screen, every Ewok, the creature that eats the creature outside Jabba’s Palace, the creature that got eaten outside of Jabba’s Palace, the annoying non-original song dancers from Jabba’s Palace who should have been eater, and the frogs in Jabba’s bowl. All are WELL ahead of that moronic droid character in Solo."

StarWars,ffefnyf,t1_ffe6lta,1579846202.0,I understand it’s an opinion piece. I posted it because I thought it was hilariously bad. You’re right though I am shocked Rose isn’t on there. Maybe they forgot about her. If they did maybe they could share how they did it so we can too!
StarWars,ffecot8,t1_ffdy9di,1579843256.0,Of course. I’ve always liked drawing but I’ve gotten immensely better in the last few months just by watching YouTube tutorials about how the eye perceives color and shades. It’s so easy to fool the eye. Once you learn a bit about the way light works and how to handle shading you start to improve very quickly.
StarWars,ffec1gj,t1_ffe2zea,1579842652.0,Lol nice! Actually Luke might have made it in the top 10 if it was in alphabetical!
StarWars,ffdxr99,t3_et32to,1579831558.0,"Nice job. Try drawing him over and over until you can do it from memory and you’ll be surprised how quickly you progress. One thing to consider is try using a variety of darker or lighter pencils. This way you can get a lot of depth. Also use a fine eraser to “draw” lighter spots and edges. A few tutorials on YouTube will show you some amazing tricks that will increase your ability very quickly. Please message me if you draw something else, I’d love to see it!"
