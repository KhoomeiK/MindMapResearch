Even if you aren’t hiding anything on your phone, trust is a delicate thing and if you kept refusing to not let her on your phone, your girlfriend might lose some trust in you because there’s nothing to prove that there isn’t anything on your phone. These kinds of situations are hard, you could clear your search history and just prove to her on everything that you aren’t hiding something, then she’ll have no reason to be suspicious and you can just go on to doing whatever you did before without her knowing your password or something."

At her age I would probably start getting her into YAF, she may seem too young, but if she likes reading she should be fine with it. Just try and make sure you’re not giving her books that are way too easy, plus, it’s good for kids to be challenged by what they’re reading. If she goes to the juvenile section of the library, maybe start going to the YA section, but make sure to read through the books yourself or look them up so she doesn’t read books with sex or anything in them, it’s sometimes hard to tell from the cover. I would also let her read books with swearing in them, she may seem young but she most likely hears it at school anyway."
