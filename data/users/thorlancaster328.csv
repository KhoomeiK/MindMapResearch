OP got the virus by downloading Lucky Patcher from the wrong location. luckypatchers dot com is the only official site, and there are several other sites (also claiming to be the official site) that will give you nasty malware.

Oftentimes, those fake sites get clicks because they are ""sponsored listings"" (AKA ads) in Google Search. They look quite similar to an actual search result and are easy to click on. By the time you realize you've downloaded the wrong Lucky Patcher, the damage has been done.

Google doesn't give a damn about these fake ads, especially fake versions of hacking tools that bypass Google's security. Since Lucky Patcher can hurt their ad revenues (by blocking mobile ads), they just let the malicious ads run.

Get an Adblocker and make sure it is on before you go searching for dodgy software. Doing this, as well as research into where the right download site is, will drastically reduce your chances of getting malware."

If it breaks you'll have to take it to a dealer to get it fixed. It is difficult to make it go faster, and if it detects tampering it'll brick itself.

I have a pack built from those cells that's still going strong (about 90% capacity left) after almost 2 years.

If you want pre-assembled packs, I've heard good things about Unit Pack Power. Only bad thing is their nickel strips are a bit thin for high power motors (several kilowatts). With your hub setup you should be just fine.

Best of all, lithium doesn't suffer from the Peukert effect and lasts for at least 3x the cycles of lead. In less than a year you'll most likely need new batteries, unless you keep them fully charged most of the time and don't discharge them too deep."

On the positive side, it'll be a great source of fatlogic for this sub."
lockpicking,fcbiizd,t1_fc9vy8u,1577587283.0,The safety rotator mechanism looks like a method to prevent bypassing the cylinder with a wire. Looks like the pin tumbler mechanism is the part giving you trouble.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcbcol0,t3_eggwhy,1577585249.0,"Do not hold in hand. Light fuse and get away. This product travels at high speeds and may travel long distances. Misuse may result in injury or fire.

Idiots like this is why we can't have nice things."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fcbcffu,t1_fcamcic,1577585162.0,At this point #obvioustrollisobvious
insanepeoplefacebook,fcbajt0,t3_egsz4i,1577584502.0,"At least they're indirectly acknowledging that God didn't create the earth 5,000 years ago."
lockpicking,fcb9vd3,t3_egoxix,1577584253.0,"If price is no issue, get three Rotalok closed shackle padlocks and put Abloy cores in them. The only way to get these off is with an angle grinder and a lot of time.

They have a free-spinning rotating body that stops twisting attacks, and a shackle guard that makes bolt cutters slide off.

Just don't lose the keys  :)"
ebikes,fcb8zm6,t3_egugxt,1577583925.0,"A big difference between the two systems is upgradeability and maintainability. With the Bafang, you can get new parts, including steel replacement gears and controllers, from vendors such as Luna cycle. With the Bosch, it's a closed system. If it breaks you'll have to take it to a dealer to get it fixed. It is difficult to make it go faster, and if it detects tampering it'll brick itself.

The Bosch battery also charges to a unchangeable 4.2 volts (you can only use their proprietary chargers), while the Bafang can use any battery you want and charge it however you wish (Charging to 4.1 instead of 4.2 can as much as double cycle life)."
ebikes,fcb1hqz,t1_fc4vqmt,1577580874.0,"Where did you hear that? With the slowest (1 month) shipping option, I ended up paying around $20 for shipping on my cells last year.

The only way it'd be $800 is if you wanted next day (hazmat) air shipping."
ebikes,fc20eus,t1_fc1znbm,1577335597.0,"Where have you been looking for batteries? I get mine from [nkon.nl](https://nkon.nl) and $300 would get you enough Samsung 30Qs to blow this out of the water. [batteryhookup.com](https://batteryhookup.com) is also a good place to get (lightly) used batteries. I have a pack built from those cells that's still going strong (about 90% capacity left) after almost 2 years.

If you want pre-assembled packs, I've heard good things about Unit Pack Power. Only bad thing is their nickel strips are a bit thin for high power motors (several kilowatts). With your hub setup you should be just fine.

Best of all, lithium doesn't suffer from the Peukert effect and lasts for at least 3x the cycles of lead. In less than a year you'll most likely need new batteries, unless you keep them fully charged most of the time and don't discharge them too deep."
ebikes,fc1ytrx,t3_efpqda,1577334026.0,Looks pretty cool but you'll probably end up converting it to lithium in a few months. With that center triangle full of good lithium batteries you could go 60+ miles on a charge at a constant 30MPH.
ebikes,fc1yinr,t3_efovu2,1577333730.0,"Idiots like this are how fast e-bikes are going to become illegal. Even if you were riding a motorcycle with good brakes and full protective gear, this fast in the city is simply not safe whatsoever.

If you wanna go fast, find a long straight road where you aren't going to T-bone someone in an intersection."
IdiotsInCars,fbzjt5r,t3_ef812b,1577249092.0,They could have really used a tear gas grenade for that one. Would have gotten the idiot out of the car real quick.
