As a 6-month blue belt I'm still new to the idea of mentoring other people in jiu jitsu--so far I've received a lot of help and advice from others but rarely felt experienced enough to give any. Making friends with u/ratthewmcconaughey was cool because I HAVE already competed a fair amount and I DO know some things that I hope she found useful. (You should see our texts about how to cut weight). I hope you know I'm incredibly proud of you and you do SO many things right already. As we both continue to train we're going to have fun learning from each other.

By the way, I hope it's clear that u/ratthewmcconaughey got to take a class from Marcelo ON HIS BIRTHDAY. Earlier that morning he was in the new women's locker room helping fix it up himself. I made the dubious choice to make him b-day cupcakes while cutting weight for the comp. Had to distract him from locker room renovations long enough to give him one!

Group classes move FAR too fast to do real strength training, which is slow-paced and requires rest periods that are typically 1-2 minutes long. Setting progressive lifting goals and/or calisthenic goals will also help you to perform better in group classes. I can't tell you how many people I see in yoga who can't do a single pushup and thus can't do chaturangas, or who sag when in plank position because their core is weak. Your cardio output is also limited by the size of your engine, i.e. strength of your muscles."
fatlogic,fe7cpu8,t1_fe6a7hl,1578912864.0,"Mmm, one of the benefits of the vegan diet they tout is that it is high carb and, yeah, eating lots of vegetables has health benefits. I think it's totally possible to eat a healthy vegan diet as an athlete. The moral claim is probably the strongest one the diet has, but I fear it bleeds into the health claims and falsely motivates people to overstate them. I'm nutritionally agnostic. Fatty fish has some pretty undeniable health benefits and I'm unconvinced by ""documentaries"" that make so many pseudoscientific claims:  [https://tacticmethod.com/the-game-changers-scientific-review-and-references/](https://tacticmethod.com/the-game-changers-scientific-review-and-references/)  is just one review of the many holes in Game Changers."

xxfitness,fdw9uuv,t3_en5ple,1578756560.0,Hey fitness people! Stats are F/32/133#/5'6''. Do you think it's possible for me to drop my mile time 20-30 seconds this year while still juggling BJJ training and calisthenics? I train BJJ 4 times a week for two hours at a time and do short runs plus calisthenics/weights on other days. I used to be a runner and my mile PR is 5:38. I know I can't do that now. I can probably do 6:25. I would like to run sub-6 again. Is that just too much based on everything else I'm doing? I don't want to PR or anything--I was running 35 mpw when I set my PR.

bjj,fdw7ks9,t1_fdw1dax,1578755917.0,"Fun story! Last year I was rolling with a good blue belt guy, my finger got caught somehow, he inverted, and wham, fifth metacarpal fracture. He felt terrible, I felt terrible, tape shockingly did not fix it... but you know what, when we train BJJ these things are going to happen. You can certainly apologize, and you should; you could perhaps talk to the gym instructor about how to avoid such things happening in the future as much as possible.

The happy ending to my own story is that I survived the six weeks off the mat and am now friends with the guy who injured me. We drill together now pretty regularly--partly because he owes me ;) and partly because we are a similar size and skill level. I don't have any hard feelings. I didn't even feel schaudenfreude when he hurt his knee in a tournament recently. I was simply glad when he got back on the mats."

fatlogic,fdh3ez1,t3_el4ax1,1578414534.0,"There's a grain of truth to this idea. A LOT of anorexics develop reactive eating or binge eating as a result of prolonged starvation. It's actually quite common and a reason many anorexics transition into either bulimia or BED.  I experienced that myself, and my weight literally doubled in a year, from 88 to 180 pounds. It was profoundly shocking and traumatizing. I'm pretty sure the fact that I was an adolescent at the time, with a less-developed prefrontal cortex (i.e. self-control) contributed. And, longterm, I have reached a healthy weight using the normal methods instead of extreme restriction. Reactive eating, though, is very much a common phenomenon in anorexia and is not spoken of often enough, probably because it isn't as ""sexy"" as simple self-starvation."
actuallesbians,fdgxtij,t1_fdgp6aa,1578410967.0,"I also used to think guys (actually lesbians as well!) were ""lucky"" and envied them and wished I ""were one of them"" without realizing that, duh, I was. It was to the point where when I tried making out with guys I imagined myself in their bodies instead of mine. I tried to express this to people and everyone was confused by it.

Also used to admire guys from a distance (actually I still do--especially athletically) but was disgusted and bored once I actually had to be near them. I used/performed relationships with guys for social acceptance and enjoyed stuff like cuddling but disliked kissing and refused sex completely.

It is SO DIFFERENT dating a woman. I want to be near her all the time. I can't kiss her enough, literally never want to stop. Also, during sex, I actually care about her pleasure and get turned on when she does, versus disgusted when it was a guy."

That took a long-ass time to accomplish, though. Probably 9 months of solid practice, weight training, band-assisted (band strung across bottom of squat rack beneath bar). Losing some weight helped but not as much as you would think, oddly."
xxfitness,fde0jmw,t3_ehj81o,1578328432.0,"Two-stripe blue under MG and I compete a fair amount. I have some powerlifting and Oly lifting experience and the black belts I talk to tell me that helps a lot; I find I can survive rolls with guys well and often overpower other women my size. I agree that hips are key. Deadlifts, squats (front squats too, maybe zercher), hip thrusts, box jumps, power cleans (no need to become an expert on all the olys imho), kettlebell swings, all definitely great. I also do things that work grip, balance, and core like pull ups, push ups, handstands, etc. A great female black belt at my gym recommends towel grip pull ups. I can't do those yet--I can only do 3 regular pull ups--but obviously those help especially if your game has some spider or lasso guard.

I'm probably in the minority who gets most of my cardio from just rolling. I do like to run, row, and swim when I can't be on the mats."

It's so pleasurable to do cool physical thing that sometimes I would rather get in a workout than have sex (ideally I'd have sex afterwards, post-shower). I've found incredible community and friends through exercise/sports. So... if making friends through BJJ is getting ""social privilege,"" I'm guilty, I guess??? There are also many fat people who train at my gym and enjoy that community too, btw.

There is, I believe, some evidence that being obese decreases the pleasurable chemicals you get from exercise. Add that to the difficulty of moving more mass and I am actually pretty sympathetic to fat people who dislike working out.

xxfitness,fd98lvc,t3_eikf5j,1578229998.0,"It's hard to run a fast half running so little. Your overall weekly mileage simply has to be higher. I ran a 1:30:56 (to be exact... I was in my early 20s and am female) half when running 35-45 miles a week, and that is considered LOW mileage. So the first thing to do is simply run more. Then, for speed training, you need structure. At least one long run a week--progressing from 8-11 miles perhaps--along with one day of intervals, one tempo, and two very easy runs. If you want to do your best on the run I'd skip leg day for a few weeks or go light. Fast intervals are essentially anaerobic; I got good leg development just from sprinting when I was younger.

I recommend you read some books on running like Brad Hudson's book on road racing, which is very accessible, or Jack Daniels."
