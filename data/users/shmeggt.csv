worldnews,ffanwjo,t3_esevim,1579740371.0,"I'm sure this will be buried but I want to provide a possible rationale for this. This may not be the reason or background for this law, but historically, laws like this were supposed to be designed to save women who were raped in cultures and communities where women who weren't virgins were considered ""ruined"" (a disgusting thing). The point of these laws were not for the victim to live with their rapist, but require the rapist to care for the victim financially like a husband would."

EngineeringStudents,fcynk20,t3_eji2d6,1578083383.0,"The irony of the entire situation is that employers have a hard time finding good candidates the same way candidates have a hard time finding an employer.  The amount of noise in the system is overwhelming, so it's quite likely that good resumes end up getting thrown out with bad ones because of inaccurate automated processes to clear out the trash.  

Let's say you're an EE major at a mid-tier school and you're looking for an internship.  You send in your resume to ABC Corp, a large, multi-national corporation with a huge hiring organization.  Because of its size and recognized name, ABC Corp gets thousands and thousands of resumes.  It is impossible to go through each one.  Even if you could employ a workforce to do that, they'd end up glossing over them because it'd be so tedious.  Instead, they buy and configure resume software to handle this workload.  Of the 5,000 resumes they get for their internship program, they need to automatically screen out 90% of the resumes immediately, so they're left with 500 for manual review.  Then they need to get this down to 100 people they actually want to talk to for initial interviews for the 20 roles they have available.  

So, your role as John Q. Engineer is to ensure your resume makes it past the initial automated screen.  Here's the problem:  you have no idea what software they use or how they've configured it.  Maybe they only hire from a handful of schools, so you're screwed anyway.  Maybe they're looking for specific words in your resume that you either don't have in or have included in a different way.

So... ABC Corp is stuck using software that hatchets out big chunks of resumes because they get too many, meaning some good ones are going in the bin with the bad ones.

This is why connections help... From a hiring perspective, a decent hire from a referral is far easier and more likely to be successful than looking for the needle in a haystack of resumes that come in through the normal channels.

**Now on to some advice:**  You already have connections... you probably just don't realize it.  If you don't have a LinkedIn account, set one up immediately.  Start connecting with people you know... classmates, friends, professors, family friends, etc.  This will open you up to 2nd level connections where you can ask people to make introductions for you.  People want to help you.  Be direct and honest with what you're looking for.  

It can be really hard to decide what you want to do when you're early in college.  So many people want to go work for SpaceX or Google or Amazon.  Feel free to apply there, but look for things smaller and closer.  Smaller companies will often give you far more responsibility and experience than huge companies with huge internship programs.  

Look for lists of good companies to work for in your city.  See what they do and if it interests you.  Look at your local engineering association (IEEE for Electrical Engineers).  See if they have lists of local companies.  Perhaps they have events that you can attend to meet people.  Apply online and then try to find the HR manager on LinkedIn and see if they're willing to speak with you.  Again, be direct, honest, and professional.

Good Luck!"
