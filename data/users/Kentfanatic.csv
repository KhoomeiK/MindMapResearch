pregnant,fefqrkx,t1_fefqfov,1579062512.0,"Not when your max out of pocket is $3000. Also if I got cancer in a different country, I would have to wait months for treatment anyway and probably die. My dad (Who lives in a country with universal healthcare) had to wait for months for a heart surgery that he should’ve had the day he was told he needed surgery. That’s what universal healthcare does. They get you on a waiting list and then you have to wait until they want to pay for or they think you are worth the money."
AmItheAsshole,fefqf6n,t3_eon6gr,1579062255.0,"NTA. You have the right to include or exclude anyone from spending time with your child. If she’s getting huffy over a name that’s her issue. However I can see why she would find that a little offensive that her granddaughter is named after the other grandmother, but there’s a better way to express your feelings."
pregnant,fefpuft,t1_feflsly,1579061821.0,Yeah but our taxes are really low here. I would rather pay low taxes every year and the occasional hospital bill than have to pay half of my salary in taxes all the time.
AskReddit,fecmn5t,t3_eogim4,1578977696.0,I have students that do “Me” often.
AskReddit,fecmfn9,t3_eodtd1,1578977536.0,"I had a student and her boyfriend in my class. She did all her work and listened and studied .... at first. He watched sports on his phone and tried to distract everyone especially his GF. He also had no respect for anyone. I slowly watched her grade slip in my class and even her last paper was 100% plagiarized! I just watched them and question what she saw in him and if she really thought she would have security with him. He couldn’t even take care of himself. Last I heard, they’re still dating and she’s failing all her classes this trimester. I’m literally watching her f up her life and it hasn’t even really started yet!"

AskReddit,fec95of,t3_eo83cx,1578968857.0,"Yes. A huge thing I looked for in a partner is the ability and desire to procreate. I want kids, and I’ve always wanted kids. Obviously if I married someone and found out that I couldn’t have kids with them I would figure something out, but if that person beforehand had knowledge that I would never be able to have kids with them (weather through fertility tests or that they were transgender into a male) and they kept that from me, I would be devastated and hurt beyond belief."

AskReddit,fe913og,t3_eo681x,1578933050.0,"I have faith in God that everything happens for a reason (whether it be good or bad). I also have forgiven those who I needed to forgive so I could move on with my own life and they can’t hold me back through my anger and fear of them. I know this can’t help everyone, but it’s helped me and I have a very comfortable life now that I put it all behind me and am looking to the future with my SO and un-born child."
AskReddit,fe8zrkv,t3_eo68bc,1578932689.0,"Well, I don’t know where you live, but where I live, I have never seen an advertisement for gambling aside from the billboards right next to the casino and hour away. I see an alcohol advertisement every commercial break on tv, so I think it just depends where you live."
JUSTNOMIL,fe5c5ih,t3_enk6jb,1578867574.0,"I told my husband that his whole family needs to get their vaccines updated, flu shots, etc. because I get sick very easily and if our baby is anything like me, it will get sick too. I told him his family has to do it or they don’t get to meet the baby. Like someone else mentioned, it’s not about forcing anyone. It’s making a choice. Choose to get vaccinated for yourself and my potentially easily sick child, or you can meet the baby when the baby can get it’s own vaccines."
JUSTNOMIL,fe54vp5,t1_fe08ypg,1578865690.0,"A friend of mine that I didn’t even know was pregnant told her in-laws at her BIL wedding week vacation and after the wedding her MIL posted all the pics of the wedding week vacation and showed how much fun it was. However, if you scroll through the pictures, on one of them it said as the caption “DH and my friend shared some exciting news!” With a pregnancy and baby bottle emoji. I was shocked and I don’t know if my friend noticed or not, but I would not have taken that well. They announced it officially I think a few weeks later."
JUSTNOMIL,fe53k8y,t3_eni4jl,1578865359.0,"This is why I am not going to send any photos to family and no one is seeing my child for the first 24 hours. This allows me time to rest, especially because my chances of a c-section just increased, and it allows me time to announce my child myself on social media. My MIL is not on FB, but I’m not taking chances with either side of the family."
EntitledPeople,fe4h1wf,t3_enl2ft,1578859202.0,"It’s polite to help out parents when you see them struggling, but at the same time parents should not feel entitled to special privileges just because they have a child."
cat,fe086kg,t1_fdvs71m,1578805678.0,"I have 3 more cats. One loves me to the point she suckles on my neck for comfort and falls asleep. The other one won’t cuddle with either of us, but will cuddle up to us. And the smallest one (5 months old) loves cuddling with my husband and it makes me cry since he’s my baby and all I want is him to cuddle with me! That and pregnancy hormones."
IDOWORKHERELADY,fdz69vt,t1_fdyksjt,1578787110.0,"Ok! The way you worded it, it sounded like that. I was just feeling so bad if that were the case. I need my prep hour everyday. I would be working longer if I didn’t have it!"
IDOWORKHERELADY,fdx9ewx,t1_fdx8ku5,1578766596.0,Well that sucks! I couldn’t survive without my prep period. That’s where I do all my printing/copying and grading so I don’t have to do it at home.

IDOWORKHERELADY,fdfzls0,t1_fdfqikb,1578374781.0,"Like I said, they really don’t escalate like a lot of the other stories I read. My best over reaction though was an very old teacher did not like being told she made a mistake and said “well you should wear a badge!” 

I kind of look around while still pointing to my badge, so I put my hand do and use my other hand to then pull at my tag to display it closer to her. 

She gets a little more mad and just starts sputtering and clomps away making those high heel click clack sounds very loudly and obviously in frustration. She hasn’t made eye contact with me since."

IDOWORKHERELADY,fdfylp8,t1_fdfpbze,1578373880.0,The school year is broken up on to 3 trimesters rather than 2 semesters. This is to allow more time in core classes and opportunities to be involved in electives. Ironically though I am also in my 2nd trimester of pregnancy too.

AskReddit,fcph2o8,t3_ehgu4r,1577863727.0,"This is my husband’s story. It was his first/high school girlfriend and from what I heard she was very clingy and very stalkerish. He planned to break up with her that day and for some reason he felt if he didn’t do it then, it would be harder later. 

He gets a text from her saying she’s in the hospital and just got out of surgery with a burst appendix. When he got there, her and her family were going on and on about how it’s so nice she has a man there for her in this trying time and he’s just thinking “are you freaking kidding me?! Frick, frick, frick!”. 

He waited until all family were out of the room and he broke up with her, explaining he is about to go off to college and other parts of life and she just wasn’t the one and wishes he could have done this sooner. She’s obviously crying and he leaves. 

He realized his keys were still in her room so he goes back for them and.... stares from family  sending daggers is what met him as he entered the room, silently grabbed his keys, and shut the door on his way out again."

I do have an over baring SIL that literally grabs our nephew and runs away with him and acts like she’s his mom and it makes me nervous what she will do with our baby. If she does even half the things my friend does, I would want her to stop and if she won’t listen to me hopefully she’ll listen to an outsider.
