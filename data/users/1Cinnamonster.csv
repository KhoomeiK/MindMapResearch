todayilearned,fedo811,t1_fecn6bo,1579016264.0,"To some extent. What used to be prescriptive was details about regenerating forests, and now it's basically left to the industry. Some are good, but most are cutting costs by doing the bare minimum."

Marybeth Miller might still be alive had she not been ""running alone and wearing a Walkman.""

todayilearned,fecbjrp,t1_fecbb2x,1578970187.0,BC treats forests like it's an infinite supply. Old growth? Cut it down before someone else does...
todayilearned,fecalsl,t1_fec7blc,1578969655.0,"Like almost anything, there's the bare minimum way of doing things and there's best management practices. Lots of forest companies in Canada clearcut and pretty much nuke the forest - in BC about 15 years ago, the forest companies had to follow a fairly presecriptive process to regenerate areas that were logged. After lobbying by the industry, this was replaced the forest practices code, which relies on ""professional oversight"" (ie self-regulating). Now we have caribou in steep decline thoughout most of BC, as well as other species that depend on old-growth. Some forests should absolutely be left alone. You don't get 2m diameter cedar trees that acts as a home for everything from black bears to ants by harvesting every couple of decades."
todayilearned,fec9v5s,t1_fec7s4c,1578969245.0,They're also often planted in rows. Not many forests grow in perfectly straight lines.
dogs,fec88o2,t3_eo5tdp,1578968364.0,"This was my brother, set on kitten instead of an adult cat. Rehomed after a month because it had too much energy. This was also my brother set on a Bernedoodle. Well-trained dog obedience-wise but accidentally conditioned to associate humans and dogs with a shock from his e-collar. Oops. Well, now he's my dog since he started biting people out of fear they would shock him. Do you think my brother has learned his lesson? Nope, the joke in my family is that my next dog is going to be a labradoodle. I love my brother and I know he means well, and I'm glad his pets aren't ending up in shelters, but I really think he should stick to sea monkeys."

funny,fdk83n0,t1_fdjhgva,1578498229.0,"There's actually lots of short-term examples of natural selection working to change species. If you're interested in this stuff, you should look up how swifts that live near highways and nest under bridges are evolving shorter wings (selection pressure to avoid vehicles must be pretty high). This is on a scale of a few decades. Also, the rare black butterfly morphs of a species that was almost always white was more favoured during the beginning of the industrial revolution when soot was covering tree trunks, making the white morph much more visible to predators and selected against - in a very short period of time this completely changed the look of that butterfly. Some pretty fascinating examples."
funny,fdjfl2v,t1_fdhbov0,1578468692.0,"The majority of dogs that are overweight are so because they are overfed. Not all kibble is the same. Grocery store crap is just that, crap. But some companies spend a lot of money hiring experts and specially formulating the diet for optimum health. A specially formulated kidney diet extended my dog's life by probably 3 years. He lived to be over 18 and was mostly fed kibble, so I think he did ok."
funny,fdjfg75,t1_fdhr6m8,1578468535.0,"Huh, interesting. When I fed my dog raw, his poops were a little smaller than when he was on kibble, but not that much. Not all kibble is the same. The more fresh ingredients the better, but a veterinary diet for dogs with kidney disease probably extended my dog's life by about 3 years. He was fed raw for about 6 months of those 3 years and lived to be over 18 so I think he did ok on kibble."
funny,fdjfcj9,t1_fdiicu9,1578468416.0,"Evolution can absolutely occur over thousands of years. That is, after all, the time frame when dogs split from wolves. No argument on the evolution of hunting partners, my dog was my partner for almost two decades. All it takes is very small genetic changes to make dogs more friendly toward people and better able to digest starches."
funny,fdh1a7f,t1_fdgt44e,1578413203.0,"dogs have been eating human leftovers for thousands of years. They literally have evolved to eat grains and cheap fillers and other things we fed them or they got into. With the exception of breeds that evolved with cultures that did not have access to agricultural food until very recently (like Inuit).

I'm not saying we should feed them cheap food, but that evolution is not the reason we shouldn't."

dogs,fdazq0b,t3_ekh1gq,1578252130.0,"Tahltan Bear Dogs. Used by Tahltan hunters, indigenous to northern BC and southern Yukon to hunt bears. They were small dogs a hunters would carry and then loose on a bear when they were close enough. The dogs were fast and agile and would yap at and confuse the bear until the hunter could arrive and kill it. Most people think of bear hunting dogs as being large to fight a bear, but even laikas and Karelian Bear Dogs are only around 50-60 lbs. Tahltan bear dogs were 15-20 lbs. Badass little dogs!"
