TooAfraidToAsk,fgsozra,t3_f09kl2,1581089547.0,"I don't think it's anything new at all. The western world is incredibly out of touch with most if the population of the world. Most of them have grueling jobs. 6 12 hour days making just enough ti live off of is the norm not the exception.  Now that being said are people more depressed or less in a place like India or Cambodia. No I don't think they are. They have connections with friends and family that are much deeper than you typically see in the western world. This support system and sense of community makes a huge difference in their happiness. The western world is getting lonelier and lonelier. That lack of connection and support makes daily life so much harder. Theres nothing to look forward to after work for so many people. That isolation is so much more rare in the developing world but becoming common in the western world.

TLDR. No, the world is much larger than the western world. A disconnection with family and friends is more the cause than a tedious job."
WTF,fgso45t,t1_fgrj4zv,1581088989.0,Speaking of the opposite housekeeping was included in this apartment we stayed in for a year. She would scrub the house down before the maid came. She was mortified that she would find something to clean. Made my life a little shit for a while there.

thatHappened,fgrrwcr,t1_fgq46gl,1581055423.0,"Summary, the bank has a high risk and incentives to bend over backwards for people that owe them a lot of money.  They can almost always make money by fucking over regular consumers.

It has to do with financial statements. When banks lend for a mortgage or a car those are the collateral and they'll rarely loan much more than the item is worth so both the risk and the dollar amount is small, the gains can be significant as a ratio to the overall loan however.  For instance a 25yr 200,000 mortgage at 6% (typical) over the lifetime will cost you 400,000. The property will rarely be worth much less than the loan amount + payments already made.

If you default they take the home, if you've been making payments for even a few years the bank will make money. So it makes sense for them to take your property. It's not in their interest to help you. You can file bankruptcy but this does not absolve your debt. You will need to continue to make payments on the home or the bank will take it.

Now take a 65 million business loan. These loans are typically leveraging future success of the business. Not the value of the business. As we've seen over and over again the value of a business can fluctuate wildly in relatively short amounts of time. There's high risk involved although the banks can make a considerable sum in a shorter amount if time. 5 to 10 years on average. Many are annual particularly in retail as an operating line of credit.

If you default on these loans well the bank gets very nervous.   If you can't pay them that means the business is doing poorly. A business that can secure a loan this large rarely has only 1 creditor. If the business is forced to file bankruptcy due to your loan the bank will be fighting over the remains with all of the other lenders. They can lose a lot of money.


That risk of bankruptcy gives you extreme negotiating power over the bank. If the bank rights your loan off they take a hit in that period to total revenues which in a large amount can hurt the banks bottom line as it represents money lost. Even for a large institution writing off 10s of millions of dollars 

 It's also hurting the banks business value a little as it is ""aging AR"" the past due payments, not the total loan amount just the payments show up on what's called the balance sheet. A savvy inveslooks at these past due payments when they decide to invest in the company.

Alternatively and almost universally they can redo the terms of the loan. Which in trumps case in this instance, there were many, they deferred his payments and interest for 5 years, reduced his payments when they were due again and his interest rate. THEY ALSO LOANED HIM ANOTHER 65 MILLION. Basically giving him 5 years to get his shit together. There was probably additional oversight from the banks involved they would have a representative that had some say over his businesses for that 5 year period.

This be good for the bank in several ways. Not only would they not write off the debt. The outstanding payments would no longer be considered AR (accounts receivable or past due) also it gives them a chance to increase the value of the business after 5 years so if they declare bankruptcy there is more money to recoup.

It's not unheard of for banks to do this several times before giving up. It's as deceptive as it sounds but its it's largely unregulated. Consumer loans have much more regulation. 

They would never do this for a consumer loan. Fucking never.

Hence the old saying which has been around in one form or another for a long time.  I googled and its attributed to J. Paul Getty.

If you owe the bank $100 that's your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem.

It was his fucking home. He built the resort later. 

From historic landmark to private club

Businessman Trump, during a downturn in the real estate market, faced some tough economic times in the early 1990s and floated his own proposal to develop the Mar-a-Lago property. He later pulled the plans for building eight mansions in favor of converting the historic estate into a private club.
After an estimated $10 million in renovations, the Mar-a-Lago Club opened in 1995
