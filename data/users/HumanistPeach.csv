On a completely unrelated note: your sister needs to learn how to drive ASAP. Sheâ€™s about to have a kid- that means lots of doctorâ€™s appointments and errands and it doesnâ€™t sound like you live somewhere with good public transport"

YTA OP. Your sister was in pain all night and sheâ€™s already growing a human which is highly uncomfortable and frankly dangerous. Weâ€™re you obligated to give her your drink? No. But you could have, which would have alleviated your sisterâ€™s physical pain, and you couldâ€™ve drank some water.

I know addiction in a loved one is hard to live with. Iâ€™ve been there. Guess what helps? Understanding the underlying problems of addiction, that itâ€™s a disease, and working with people where theyâ€™re at. Guess what doesnâ€™t work? Shaming an addict for being an addict.

In my opinion, if youâ€™re able to ignore climate change for a few thousand dollars now, it shows you *are* ignorant of the actual science - no one who even understands it on a basic level can possibly dismiss the danger to the human population for any amount of money. The American electorate is also very ignorant of science (last I checked, around half donâ€™t believe in anthropogenic climate change). Iâ€™m not making these statements as generalizations, but because I know the data. The US right wing *is*, in fact, categorically ignorant on many scientific issues."

JUSTNOMIL,feksnyf,t3_epk5oo,1579206780.0,"Holy crap. Are you or are you not an adult? Use your words: â€œMom, please donâ€™t touch my beard.â€ 
If she throws a fit, use your words again: â€œMom, this is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask. You wouldnâ€™t like it if I messed up your hair every time I saw you, please give me the same courtesy.â€
If she continues to act like a toddler, treat her like one: â€œI can see that youâ€™re getting very emotional about a perfectly benign request, so weâ€™re going leave and we talk when youâ€™ve calmed down.â€"

OurPresident,fee33ow,t1_fee312h,1579025394.0,More flip flopping and lies from her
OurPresident,fedntgy,t1_fecx7bf,1579016006.0,"I mean, being a woman myself, I really donâ€™t like the idea of calling any woman a snake. But yes, Warren is a liar, and calling her one is enough for me."
OurPresident,fecltxq,t1_feclida,1578977100.0,"Same. Itâ€™s frankly deeply disappointing.

And this of course is playing into corporate media and the establishment looking to drive a wedge into the progressive wing of the party, all while Pelosi withheld the article of impeachment to ensure the two progressive candidates (who also happen to be sitting Senators) have to go DC for the Impeachment Trial while the establishment candidates cavort around Iowa in the weeks before the caucuses."
OurPresident,fecinfd,t1_fecik21,1578974842.0,"Agreed. I unsubscribed from her email list and let them have it in the â€œwhy are you unsubscribing?â€ section. She was always only my back up, but I canâ€™t with her anymore."
OurPresident,fecdyj6,t1_fecdnd3,1578971637.0,100% I just had to go double check my email and make sure I hadnâ€™t donated any money to her in the early days out of an urge to support progressivism in a broad field. Luckily I didnâ€™t. But PSA: Act Blue will refund your donation if you did!
OurPresident,fecbm6y,t1_fecbfy9,1578970224.0,"Thatâ€™s fair, I found it cowardly as well. I was trying to give her a clean slate now that she was swearing off corporate $$$ this time around, but it seems I was too optimistic."
OurPresident,fec9jwk,t1_febj6pi,1578969074.0,"Same here. I started losing respect for her when she started waffling on Medicare for All, lost even more with the â€œno beef with billionairesâ€ bs, and today made me lose every last ounce of hope for her decency as a candidate. Oh well."

AmItheAsshole,feb0ut8,t1_feay6ec,1578954316.0,Because we allow private money (aka legalized bribery) in our politics. Corporations and billionaires have bought the system

worldnews,fe9w4m8,t1_fe9ndr2,1578941953.0,"I guess you didnâ€™t read my comment thoroughly? Or did you just miss the part where I said none of this would have happened if 45 had just stayed in the damn nuclear deal?
 Nor did I say those were the only reasons for any of the actions. The comment I replied to asked if we were the bad guys. The simple answer is yes, in both cases. There is plenty of oil here in the US, and we could have focused on that to hedge for the Cold War, but we chose to â€œsecureâ€ cheap access to the oil of other sovereign nations via a series of coups and assassinations."

Awwducational,fe99klk,t1_fe98lgd,1578935576.0,"Iâ€™m not sure! There are comments below saying no itâ€™s not legal, but my class went down to Clearwater FL (this would have been in Feb of 2007 because Iâ€™m old), and we went out on the water with a Swim With Manatees Tour and they were the ones who told us about the moss and tummy scritches. I made very good friends with a baby manatee who *loved* the scritches and playing so it followed me around for the whole two hours I was in the water. Itâ€™s still to this day one of my favorite memories!"
Awwducational,fe981zr,t1_fe8kqih,1578935196.0,"You should go swim with them next time! They get mods growing on their bellies and some will just legit flip over for belly rubs like a dog so you scritch all the moss off their tummy!
Edit: have seen below that touching them is still a no no. Which also means that the swim with manatees trip my AP Bio class went on in high school broke some rules ðŸ˜³"
worldnews,fe96c0f,t1_fe8xxsf,1578934759.0,"Yes we are, especially in this situation. None of this would be happening if we hadnâ€™t assassinated their democratically elected leader in 1953 (he wanted to nationalize Iranâ€™s oil and we canâ€™t have that! That would mean weâ€™d have to pay more for it!), and then installed an insane religious dictator. It also wouldnâ€™t be happening if 45 had just stayed in the damn nuclear deal. But 45 is so thin skinned and racist that he just canâ€™t abide by Obama having done something good."
