TBF, I don’t know if this is exclusive to Pixel. It’s just the only Android I’ve used in the last 6 years. 

Yeah, it’s the thing I miss the most about it. I regularly get pissed at callers because of it. It’s so annoying when you’re composing a text, Reddit post, login to a site or app, etc and your entire screen is blocked for 45 secs. STUPID. 

It’s kinda funny tho, I’m paying for an iPhone XS and Pixel 3 (because dumb reasons), but it’s a pain in the ass to deal with iMessage so I am reluctant to switch."
