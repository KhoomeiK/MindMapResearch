- Immediately asking for your age.  As king pointed out, this is a) a way to discern whether you're worth his fantasy time and b) gives him an in, if he lies about his own age.
- ""Does me being forward and **dominant** bother you?"" While not necessarily a flag outside of private chats with creeps, it's 100% a sign that the creep is a predator.  No ethical dom leads with this shit.
- ""As long as you're a good girl"" combined with the dominance bit, he's clearly looking for a sexual angle.  If it were me, I'd have noped out of the conversation right there.  No good is to be had past that point.
- ""If you want to call me anything call me sir"" Again, trying to flex a muscle that he doesn't have.  In this situation, he sees you as a sex object that should belong to him, and will try at every angle to make that a reality.
- ""I won't call you [pet names] if you don't want...[proceeds to call you a pet name again after you indicate you DON'T want]"" Along with this, he ignored multiple boundaries you tried to set.  That is garbage and he is garbage; your boundaries are valid. Block and ignore.

Best of luck next time some asswipe comes around your DMs."

I would argue that he's attempting to reclaim the slurs that were slung at him by his bullies, but the point stands that he's a neurotypical, skinny, straight white male and he knows he shouldn't throw those words around lightly."

AskReddit,fecekie,t1_feb5l9b,1578972049.0,"You've gotten very close.  This describes attraction more than relationship style, and the two are separate things.  You've also described what a lot of us call the ""bi-cycle.""

The bi-cycle is a punny name for the fluidity of attraction that many bisexuals and pansexuals experience.  It's not always equal attraction towards everyone - some days/weeks/months/years, a person might experience attraction pretty much exclusively for one gender, and then flip to another one or find the spectrum of attraction has broadened over time.  Personally, I'm usually an equal-opportunity bi: put attractive people in front of me and I want to smooch them all.  However, I'll go through cycles of who I want to seek out as a sexual partner, based on...I don't know, how many birds crossed my path? Hormones are weird.

Relationship style is separate from physical attraction.  Attraction is hormones; relationships are work.  Pan, fluid, and bi folks are all equally likely to be in monogamous relationships as monosexual folks.  This is where your cheese analogy breaks down.  A monogamous relationship is a committed, one-to-one relationship, regardless of what gender that person is dating.  It's just like a standard hetero relationship, in that two people agree to it and enter it with the understanding that it's exclusive to all other partners (gender unspecified because IT DOES NOT MATTER). And, just like straight partners cheat, so to bi/pan/fluid ones; all humans are garbage.  We're not more or less likely to cheat than straight folks.

I would guess that we're more likely to seek ethical nonmonogamous relationships but that's a statistic pulled right out of my poly ass."

I literally had a conversation with one of a pair of brothers while we were all drinking on a rooftop about how he liked getting to see his brother's ""game"" in action.

A friend of mine had it worse; she specifically chose an outdoorsy hiking nature trip, and all but one other person had ignored the trip description and expected to just go partying the whole time.
