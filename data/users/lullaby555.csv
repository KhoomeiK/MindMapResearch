I have noticed the people who addicted to pmo are the people who are hooked on high in general, who are too obsessed to get 100% from life, who are too focused on being happy and having success
and they never feel content actually
this is me 
you are right, you should find the golden middle, without big ups without big downs, enjoy simple things around you right here right now"
NoFap,ffr0brk,t3_eur808,1580147657.0,"I guess you really crave to QUIT that’s the issue, you can’t accept you fail and you can’t understand that fap is not like quit smoking or alcohol, can’t be compared - it’s way way harder, it takes much time, months and years. 
For me even one single urge which I managed to overcome is a great victory, so you can’t be called a slave if you did make this tiny one-time victory, needless to mention if you stayed solid for few days or weeks or months"
NoFap,ffin15s,t3_etu4k6,1579977793.0,"Yes, sort of agree"
GarageBand,ffhs0ja,t1_ffe5wl3,1579950881.0,"Yes, I can"
GarageBand,ffbf3rj,t1_ff9pept,1579762554.0,Appreciate your time anyway
GarageBand,ff9l937,t1_ff9clhk,1579715366.0,"No no, I don’t need it, I just say I want to play repeatedly that extract in the bottom(the active one), so that as soon as the header comes to its end it comes back to the start and play again (put it as simple as I could). You know like it is in all desktop daw like Ableton, Logic Pro X... but looks like no way to do it."
GarageBand,ff92zvs,t1_ff90jkv,1579703588.0,"Yes, I tried that, but it again just dublicates my extract. As I understand I can repeatedly play back only song sections - in my case it is 8 bar A section. It works fine if my extract is 4 bars sharp, but if it is more than 4 bars it cuts off a chunk from the second loop so make it up to 8 bars. Or if it is say 3 bars it cuts off two bars from the 3rd loop."
GarageBand,ff8z21t,t3_esbf0o,1579700575.0,"But it dublicates it, what I need is put this section on repeated play-back"
NoFap,fejopi3,t3_epe5z2,1579181835.0,Damn true!
socialanxiety,fej51v0,t1_fej112r,1579157191.0,Appreciate it! Very nice piece of advice!
