AskReddit,feuoth3,t1_fetqhmh,1579388596.0,Lol how vapid of a person are you that you can't look past the silliness of a plot and just enjoy a movie for it's acting and punchlines.
AskReddit,feumwqf,t1_feu5f0e,1579388034.0,"Yeah I saw the previews with Driver and Tatum and was like eh that would probably be decent.  Then I saw Daniel Craig with the hair and the accent and was like.... *Is that Daniel Craig..*. I had to look it up, and was like I don't care what the plot is to this movie I'm going to watch it.  

One of the few movies I've watched soley because of the cast."

Offsetting his skill cap a bit so he still stands a chance against  one trick mains and stuff.  

I don't think his goal is to roll over people all day, but to grind out a smurf in different roles and champs than he typically mains."

PublicFreakout,fe5ul00,t1_fe3xyac,1578875290.0,"Not quite that dramatic.  It would be manslaughter worst case, murder implies intent to kill.  Best case probably aggravated battery (possibly with a 'weapon')  for striking someone on the ground.  All depends where you live.  

If he walked away then came back and soccer kicked him in the side of the head and that lead to his death that could be murder since he no longer has the excuse of a crime of passion and made a conscious decision to turn around and injure him further."

There's six States, many cities, and the entire country of Canada and guess how many women go walking around topless.  *None*, probably because women don't like being exposed.  

No one should be exposed in public because I shouldn't be forced to experience people's bodies against my will wether you're an attractive woman breastfeeding or some 300lb dude waddling around or everything in between.  I'm not even that against breastfeeding in public but if I had to pick which way I would lean to treat both sexes equally im definitely going with everyone being clothed in public."

So I was on a plane with three doctors and 90 pilots and the stewardess comes out and asks if there's a doctor on board something is wrong with the pilot so the doctors jump up and run in to the cabin and after a few minutes come out and pronounce the pilot dead.

'but at least we have plenty of extras one jokes' 

Panic ensues and one doctor leans over and asks a pilot what's wrong and the pilot replies

'we're all helicopter pilots!'"
worldnews,fdqwenw,t1_fdqrjg2,1578675801.0,"That's unfortunately how they have always operated though.  They literally surround themselves in non-combatants intentionally to keep themselves safe.  It's hard to fight a war against guerilla fighters because it's just whoever pledges allegiance they don't wear a uniform or ISIS t-shirts.

A good example is a few months ago there was that 'hero' dog or whatever they used to chase Baghdadi down and he used his family as human shields and blew up his children with a suicide vest. 

In the early years of the war they would get local kids to accompany them about so they wouldn't be targets.  And yes, it also creates more when we kill them as collateral, or when they're involved unwillingly.  I had a friend that had to kill a 13-14 year old girl because someone gave her a rocket launcher.  He said had it just been him he wouldn't have shot but she was aiming at his whole convoy.  Really fucked him up."
ABoringDystopia,fdo911e,t1_fdnwrdi,1578600978.0,In the US it started as a way to keep minorities out basically.  Now days it boils down to two types.  Rich neighborhoods where everyone wants picture perfect white families and all the housewives fight over HoA board seats and harass the shit out of everyone.  Or middle class neighborhoods where people just don't want to listen to your dogs bark for ten hours a day and ask you to mow your law more than once a month because the nest of snakes that took up residence might bite your kids.

So I read a lot but now it's typically a before bed type of thing than a hobby.

Listen to a lot of audiobooks though."

NoStupidQuestions,fbzirc9,t3_ef58vu,1577248074.0,"Sex offenders are seen as predatory.

If you beat a murder or kid knapping charge the odds are you probably never intended to do it to begin with.  You can be charged with kid knapping for taking your own child outside of your custody agreement.  Or charged with murder for defending yourself in some way.  Those charges are serious enough if the court was worried about you doing it again you would be in prison. 

Sex offenders are seen as predators though so you don't know 'when they'll loose control' despite having gone through therapy etc."
