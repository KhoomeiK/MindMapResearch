>Iloveoov was nicknamed ""Bus Driver"" in Korea. The Korean word for rape is ""gang gan"", but because the use of such a word is frowned upon in a professional setting, 'gang gan' was transformed into the word 'gwan gang' which means 'tour' or 'to go on a trip'. The one who takes someone on a 'tour' is the 'bus driver'. This idea came right out after the match between iloveoov and Goodfriend on nostalgia, where iloveoov took Goodfriend 'on a trip' with pure wraiths while goodfriend was defending with goliath and turrets

Bonus content: the English nickname of the Korean Starcraft pro Goofriend is ""Count dlqudals von emfznekftm"":

>As an icon of the underappreciated progamer, people jokingly started to wonder if he really existed. From this lack of recognition Goodfriend got a new nickname ""dllqudals"", which is what you get if you type his name, 이병민, on an English keyboard. This in turn continued with his fans reading dllqudals out loud in Korean and making it into the word 들쿠달스. They then once again typed this down on an English keyboard and got the word emfznekftm. These two names eventually combined with the addition of ""von"" in the middle and ""Count"" at the beginning and thus Goodfriend got the new nickname ""Count dlqudals von emfznekftm""."
soccer,fdq5y35,t1_fdq4146,1578656314.0,"In Korean Starcraft, being called a ""bus driver"" is linked to being really good. It's really complicated, but basically goes like this: people used to say they ""raped"" their opponent in video games after strong defeats. Because people eventually realized that they shouldn't use that kind of vocabulary, they used a word that sounds similar but means something completely different: driving a bus. And the person who drives the bus is the bus driver. That's why people who administered crushing defeats were sometimes called a bus driver, in admiration of their skills.
