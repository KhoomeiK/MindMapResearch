Showerthoughts,fe1epk6,t1_fe0mdu5,1578825666.0,"I am an introvert so used to speak very little with them, but when I did speak up I was only complaining. I realized this when I did some deep introspection. So I stopped complaining and learned to praise and smile more."
Showerthoughts,fe095ao,t3_eniekn,1578806533.0,"I shifted to a new hostel in 2010 while studying bachelor's of commerce. The first room mate didn't get well with me, we used to argue a lot. Second one too turned out to be an asswhole and so did the third, fourth and fifth. When the sixth one arrived I had already realised that it was me all along. So, I changed my attitude and learned to adjust. He was my room mate for 3 years."
