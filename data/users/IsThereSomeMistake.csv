Then there’s just general etiquette. More than once I’ve invested significant time slowly meandering or angling toward a bird to not alarm it and get the shot I want, only to have some jackass hop out of a car and walk directly at the bird which of course causes the bird to fly. 

One particular time I had walked around a stand of pines, keeping them between me and a flock of snow buntings. Crouching slowly and walking quietly I had invested about 15 minutes and not alarmed a single bird out of the 70 or so there. I had just picked up my lens to shoot and here comes this doofus. Parks car, hops out, heads directly toward the birds with giant tripod outstretched, making no effort to conceal his approach at all. Gets maybe 2/3 of the distance to me and the birds and poof!

birding,fezymas,t3_eqy4eq,1579463331.0,"Be patient. They’ll find it.

Two things seem likely to me. One is, maybe people in the neighborhood don’t feed birds, so the birds may not be familiar with the concept. I once had an apartment in a semi-urban area with the feeder under an overhanging deck. Took a good couple weeks for the birds to find.

Second possibility is just the time of year. If you put it up in January birds might not expect to find a new food source at this time of year. They may be frequenting other known locations for food, other feeders, food caches, natural sources etc. (only a small fraction of their diet comes from feeders) But eventually they will find it."
birding,fezw08a,t3_eqz4z1,1579462383.0,"First thing to know is that people who find owls tend not to share exact locations because of the high probability of other people freaking out and harassing them. Because they are seldom seen, people will try to get close for photographs, bait them etc. The owl doesnt benefit from this, expends calories unnecessarily, gets stressed, and may get into areas of trouble where there are cars, crows, etc. (in my area a long time ago, a picture of a great horned owl in its nest was published in the paper. They gave an approximate location - in a cemetery - and the nest subsequently failed from harassment)

At any rate, the number one rule is you have to put the time in, but there are different things you can do to increase your chances. 

1.) get out at dusk. this is when owls become active but there is still enough light to possibly catch a glimpse. I have seen dozens of owls this way

2.) learn owl calls. If you can hear them then you can go where they are likely to be

3) learn the preferred habitat for the species you wish to see as well as preferred roosting locations. 

4.) look in likely places for owl pellets and whitewash. Owls are creatures of habit. If you find a roost location and check it from time to time you will eventually find the owls

5)when you hear birds freaking out with alarm calls, try to see what they are harassing.  Sometimes it’s nothing, sometimes it’s a hawk, sometimes it will be you, occasionally it will be an owl. Crows, blue jays, chickadees, nuthatches and titmice are good species to listen for. They will each harass different species of owl if they find them. 

6) always act respectful and responsibly around the owls. (Ie, calm, quiet, from a distance) You will likely meet other people finding owls. If they know you are respectful they will share info. If you find something good, share with people who are similarly respectful. There’s definitely a network for this kind of thing and it’s much easier to network if you aren’t an a-hole.

I know I’ve been a little vague with the info but I’m very much against people harassing wildlife. Good luck!"

whatsthisbird,feswaem,t1_feseb9t,1579369665.0,"Glad to help. I get some benefit by learning the gulls (and other birds people post). That’s why I come here. 

With regard to the book, it definitely helps. I still need to get into the field to do more identifying - for me there’s no substitute for practice. I just tend to look at all the other birds before gulls.

As an aside, I bumped into Kevin Karlson in Cape May, NJ a couple years ago. Spent about an hour birding and photographing with him at the Audubon Sanctuary there. Just a great individual - super knowledgeable, very friendly and down to earth."
whatsthisbird,feroddg,t1_fepnutz,1579356465.0,"I had to go to my gull bible (Gulls Simplified by Pete Dunne and Kevin Karlson) to find a ring billed with ‘adult’ plumage. Even while showing the pink bill and gray back the examples in the book still have some juvenile streaking on the head and body. I can’t honestly tell if that’s the case in your photos. In some I think I can see it, in others it looks cleaner white. 

As far as Iceland, the photos in the book are farther off from your bird than ring billed. In every case (in the book) where Iceland shows the subadult or adult gray back, it also has a yellow bill. And while I wouldn’t rule out Iceland using this alone there are a couple other problems. First is size difference. Iceland is closer in size to herring gull to the point where there is some overlap (19-22” vs 20-24”) whereas ring billed is 17.5-20”. The gull in your photos looks much smaller to me (this could be somewhat subjective though). The second problem for Iceland is in its resting posture the wing tips extend beyond the tail. The bird is slightly turned in the photos so it’s tough to tell, but in one shot (the fourth in the series I think) it looks pretty conclusive that the wingtips end right at the tail. But on the plus side for Iceland the gray is awfully pale and I see no black in the wingtips. To answer your question, can it be ruled out? Not entirely - by me anyway. I have some misgivings about either bird though."

I am having a hard time reconciling the pink bill with what appears to be adult plumage though because it’s first winter birds that typically have the pink bill with black tip. 

But I think by this time of year the subadult first winter ring bills will retain the pink bill while also showing pale gray in the mantle. And I’m unable to come up with any other possibilities. Maybe the other photos will reveal something?"

insanepeoplefacebook,femn039,t1_felzv59,1579263184.0,"Yes I can tell you. It is very good to have formaldehyde in a living person. In fact, it means you’re alive. The human body produces about 1.5 ounces of formaldehyde a day in the course of normal metabolism. It does not accumulate and is exhaled (the exhaling part may not be the entire story. See edit.)

Of course, any one who understands risk assessment would tell you it depends on toxicity and exposure as well as the mechanism. Inhalation of formaldehyde is very very bad. Skin contact is potentially bad. It’s a known carcinogen. Making a blanket statement about it based on any one of these and applying it to all potential exposures would be misleading at best.

Edit: and while researching more, I discovered a recent paper claiming that all living things use formaldehyde in a pathway to produce amino acids and DNA.  So it turns out we might die without it. Also the body has pathways to naturally metabolize it. I will have to read up on this"

At any rate, the page on aging and sexing of Townsend’s says that spring birds are only sometimes separable. There can be overlap between adult and 1y males, as well as overlap of 1y males and adult females. However the most contrasty birds can be considered adult males, and the dullest with yellow throat are 1y females. White covert tips with no black streaking + yellow chin is diagnostic for Adult F

For fall birds, the adult male is always separable (similar to spring male but slightly duller in black areas, back tinged green) Adult female and 1y male are not reliably distinguishable. 1y female will have no black in back or sides of throat, but smudge of black on flanks. Of course the book has excellent photos of each age and gender with the descriptions so it’s very easy to visualize how they will appear with a good look in the real world.

I try to keep his expressions in use to honor his memory. I hope you use it too, just be careful not to say it at the deli. Probably would get some odd looks..."

whatsthisbird,fd4huty,t1_fcwal2m,1578167607.0,Where I am in New England it gets flagged as a rarity from Dec-Mar on eBird. Golden-crowned are present all winter. Best times for ruby-crowned are April through June and Sept to Nov
whatsthisbird,fd42ill,t1_fd3mge8,1578163773.0,"Feeders will definitely attract bird-eating hawks. For the hawks it’s just a different menu. Last spring I personally witnessed a Cooper’s hawk fly in to one tree where I have a feeder, then fly directly to the other tree where I have a feeder, then fly directly to my neighbor’s feeder tree like a pre-planned route it had used before. They have the capacity to learn just as well as, or possibly better than, passerines.

So if it looks like they’re stalking your feeders, they are. (Coincidentally one just flew over here as I type)

Also I bet you’re spot on with the harrier stealing from the Cooper’s. I’ve seen harriers harrying short eared owls (very common behavior since they occupy the same niche) as well as merlins and peregrines. Haven’t witnessed it with coopers but it’s not surprising."
AskReddit,fd3qkv4,t1_fd2w8rj,1578160848.0,Ah yes the legendary Cholmondeley! Here in the northeast US we have borrowed many of your place names with varying degrees of mispronunciation. I believe we pronounce Worcester and Gloucester the same. Norwich definitely gets the W sound as does Ipswich. I’ve heard Nor’ich before but never Ips’ich
