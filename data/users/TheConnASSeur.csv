I understand that some of those things may feel important to some people, but let me be as clear as possible, in the face of actual fascism, **none of that shit matters**. As we see our country literally move toward fascism, it's immensely frustrating to see so many people focused on the most hollow aspect of our politics. Being opposed to identity politics is not ""flirting with fascism."" Being what someone might consider an asshole is absolutely **not** fascism. Refusing to acknowledge a person's invented pronouns or micro-identifiers is **not** fascist. Fascism is **not** just a Left or Right problem. Fascism is a humanity problem. Fascism is being absolutely certain in the mortality of your beliefs, and having the power to force others to comply. Fascism is when the powerful silence those with whom they disagree. Fascism is about absolute control, and the limiting of personal liberty. Fascism is the death of our humanity. Nothing Rogan supports, or has ever supported on his podcast is fascist.


Regardless of your political leaning, if you support using force/power to limit personal liberty/free speech, believe in the absolute morality of your position and will not tolerate discourse of difficult topics, you ""flirt with fascism."" And the thing is fascism *is* really *really* tempting because the cost of all our liberties is the presence of assholes, and sometimes we all wish we could just **force** them not to be assholes. Every subreddit that bans users for behavior in other subs ""flirts with fascism"" from thedonald to offmychest and twoxchromosomes. Part of defeating fascism is learning to be uncomfortable. Does it suck when someone doesn't acknowledge your pronouns? Hell yes, it does, but *compelling* them to say what you want will eventually suck much worse. Trump demonstrates that any weapons we build to limit speech that we disagree with will eventually be seized by those without our mortality and those weapons will be turned against us in the worst way imaginable."

technology,ff3ki5x,t1_ff35rbn,1579542983.0,"It stops being confusing the moment you realize that they're pretending to support him for evangelical reasons.


 Most evangelicals have seen their rural communities erode over the past two decades. They've seen opportunity dry up, and debt grow. People keep telling them how well we're doing, but they don't see it. All they see are closed factories, crumbling streets, and abandoned stores on main street. They've been feeling the pain of a failing economy since 2004. The jobs lost in the 90's never returned to those small communities. Their world is ending, and the only thing that's different is there's a lot more rich minorities in tv.  If the economy is so good, and people they trust have told them it is, then where is all of that money going? It's not hard to see racism taking root, even if they never directly admit it. Racism is born from insecurity and fear, and brother, evangelicals are *dripping* with both.


So this clown, Trump, shows up. They know he's a slimeball, but this is the first time in 20 years that anyone has even acknowledged their pain, and what's more, the stuff he says about minorities makes them think he really *gets it*. Then when he starts really *hurting* other communities of people, they secretly rejoice because suddenly it's not just them feeling the pain. Suddenly, the right people, the people who have been sucking up all the money and benefits of this ""good"" economy, are feeling the pain. So they rejoice. After all, it's about time some one else felt the pain.


Evangelicals aren't being duped. Even if they won't admit it, they *know* what Trump is. They know he cheated to win the election. They know he's mostly corrupt. They know he's a criminal. They just don't care. That's why they seem so resistant to the tidal wave of evidence. As far as they're concerned, the system that exists failed them, so fuck it. Let it burn. At least Trump is hurting someone else for a change.


It should not surprise you that members of an apocalyptic death cult would gladly choose ""burn it all down"" over questioning their foundational beliefs and the Republican Party."

Ideally, you want to be near interior walls, in the smallest space you can find, like a closet or bathroom.

AskReddit,fdx974d,t1_fdwr15m,1578766520.0,">!Yes. You never see anything that isn't part of the dream. The entire thing is Cobb having lost control of the dream. Cobb didn't actually incept Mal so that she would realize they were dreaming. She was the one who realized they were trapped in a dream and attempted to rescue Cobb. Everything you see, and all the people in the film are creations of Cobb's subconscious built from things he's seen and people he's met. That's why the limbo that he built with Mal still exists when those structures should have vanished when they woke from the dream. It's the same dream.!< >!The ending isn't sad though, since in real time Mal will wake him up eventually, but until then Cobb's going to spend lifetimes in dreams.!<"
rareinsults,fduwi85,t1_fdu4ebc,1578740028.0,"Its not magical sci-fi shit that ""scans"" your DNA and builds a digital model you. It works through comparative analysis, meaning that you need to compare 2 sets of data. To do this they analyze people who claim to be a certain ethnicity from a certain region, and look for generic similarity. When they find shared information that is unique to that group they use that as an indicator. This means that the larger the group, the larger their initial dataset, and the more accurate their finding. The smaller the population, the less accurate. So these tests can tell you a shit load about what type of white guy you are, but determining if you've got American Indian heritage is spotty at best."
AskReddit,fdutxz4,t1_fdups36,1578738780.0,"The movie *tells* you exactly what it is, then *shows* you clear examples. It really is straight forward. Watch Paprika. Its the movie Nolan watched, then largely copied to make inception. One of the reasons >!it's all a dream!< fits Inception is that it's a plot point in Paprika that's briefly touch on. In Paprika the film quickly moves on from that to explore meatier stuff, but I can definitely see the seeds of that moment in Nolan's film."

AskReddit,fdur0pq,t1_fdubfg7,1578737640.0,"I watched it again when my wife saw it for the first time. >!Mal is telling the truth the whole time. The entire movie is structured like a dream, jumping quickly from idea to idea, and there's little details scattered throughout the film that all point to Cobb being trapped in a dream. For instance, all of the ""real world"" scenes feel claustrophobic and really closed in, almost like there's nothing outside beyond Cobb's memory of those locations.!< It blew my mind a little bit because I watched it a few times back when it first came out and thought it was pretty ambiguous. For some reason going back to it after so long made a lot of stuff obvious. The movie even *tells* you what to look for *then* shows it to you almost verbatim and I still missed it the first few times. >!Mal's death was the titular ""inception"" designed to drive Cobb to realize he was trapped in a dream.!<"

I know Trump's trying to say something here, but I can never quite figure out just what it is. He's got something like a dozen distinct theses just sort of...melted together. The best I can figure out is:


*Nuclear weapons good.

*Smart scientist uncle told me nuclear weapon's are powerful.

*Me smart.

*Me good businessman.

*Me rich.

*Liberals try to tear down conservatives by ignoring their accomplishments.

*Iran nuclear deal bad.

*Negotiations with Iran are easy because we have a lot of nuclear bombs.

*I know how many prisoners.

*Me not sexist because I praise women.

*Persians are great negotiators and they're smarter than Obama."

Yes, it would be more robust to have a single, solid unit, but the risks outweigh the benefits here. There's already an issue with analogue sticks wearing out with Switches, I can't imagine how frustrating it would be to have those issues with a $600+ device. Removable gamepads = easily replaceable gamepads."

One leads to a slightly better you, the other is a narcissistic defense mechanism that lets you stay the same. Its ultimately your choice, but choosing ignorance isn't strength of character."
witcher,fcx1qxs,t1_fcx0nf7,1578047356.0,"That's mostly the fault of the writers. They've really struggled in S1 to tell the story they apparently want to tell. From what I can tell, they want the mages to be selfish and vain, but also human, burdened with desires that their near infinite power can't fulfill. But they're just not skilled enough as writers, so the characters just sort of come off as crappy, off brand copies, where the packaging is all wrong and the flavor is weird."
