JuniorDoctorsUK,fftl0pi,t3_euvq1t,1580223276.0,At my med school we had to sit a basic arithmetic test in term 1. If you failed you got a retake then got kicked out if you failed again.

LabourUK,ffqtxjx,t1_ffqqox3,1580143562.0,"If you remember rightly, early on in his leadership they tried to smear Corbyn as culpable for all the abuse the non-Corbynite female MPs were getting (while conveniently ignoring Diane Abbot - who iirc got more than everyone else combined). 

Do think Corbyn needed to be better at address the AS issue head on and dealing with it more directly (despite a lot of vocal criticism being in bad faith)."
JuniorDoctorsUK,ffq3pgk,t3_eu6sd6,1580118734.0,"Would highly recommend Physiology at a glance. 

Have gone back to it myself now as an F1 as find physiology very helpful for remembering things by first principles. It’s a really good overview and about the right sort of level I imagine. Great illustrations and explanations so could get through the lot in a couple of evenings if you wanted to."
soccer,ffmwzrw,t1_ffmsa92,1580059752.0,"Also a doctor - do find it a little weirdly worded to not at least add on ‘because black players are more likely to have HOCM’ 

Seems like you kind of leave it open to allow people to misinterpret it when people who aren’t medical are obviously going to ask for some clarification / additional information. 

Just my two cents, and don’t object to what you’ve put. Just seemed weird to not qualify the statement, especially on reddit, imo."

wholesomememes,fey5wz2,t1_fewzg15,1579441259.0,Could see how this is easily done. Always wanted to drop some acid in there - imagine your head would metaphorically explode though.
wholesomememes,fey5tt5,t1_fewzfn7,1579441216.0,"It’s incredible isn’t it. Probably one of the best aquarium, zoo and theme parks I’ve been to all rolled into one in an absolutely incredible setting."
wholesomememes,fey5puw,t1_fextpfx,1579441157.0,My gf is obsessed with sharks. Sadly when we went (went once as a kid too) they were currently building it. Have looked it up since and looks incredible (as expected). We will definitely going back but from the U.K. so may be a few years yet.
wholesomememes,fewub3h,t1_fewo13n,1579419601.0,"If you ever get a chance, Ocean Park in Hong Kong has one of the most amazing examples of this. 

Everything else is absolutely incredible as well from rides/aquarium/animals/setting and the fact they have a massive ocean side dedicated research centre funded by the park - but the jellyfish were so memorable."
soccer,fejp31c,t1_feii5b4,1579182150.0,"Agreed, funny you can draw some comparison with Kagawa there as well. Clearly talented attacking midfielder brought in but dogged by a struggling United and being forced to play out of position. Not quite on the same scale but interesting to note imo."
AskUK,fejkb23,t1_feesmri,1579177735.0,"In fairness, cinemas make basically zilch from tickets so the insane mark-up on other confectionary etc is virtually how they offset all their overheads. 

Theatres are a similar story (depending on the show). Big musicals like blood brothers would only pay my theatre something like 40% of ticket profits over 90% attendance. 

Think people see a bag of Malteasers for 3.60 and think it’s criminal when in reality places like theatres are dependent on arts funding to survive and will still likely make thousands in losses every year."
AskUK,fejjxjk,t3_eoseu6,1579177341.0,"Longleat has always been my favourite by far (haven’t done Sherwood though). 

People seem to complain about it being hilly here but I love that about it to be honest. We would always stay far away from the centre as so pleasing to make your way round the park down the amazing boardwalks. 

Have done with bikes as well and was fine, most of the elevation is very steep so once you wheel the bike up it’s just flat to cycle (and going downhill on the steep bits is the best). 

Added bonus is it backs into the safari park so can see giraffes and hear the lions if your in the right part of the ground."
ukpolitics,fehjip8,t1_fehgaws,1579117823.0,"I’m not saying they can - but these things don’t happen in vacuum. 

Look at the kashoggi killing, that allowed Saudi Arabia a chance to deny its involvement / elements of the killing before revealing the proof they had and highlighting how duplicitous the whole affair was. 

What’s the harm in playing it like that?"
ukpolitics,fehjc6c,t1_fehgf1x,1579117717.0,"I don’t think you’ve read my comment very well. 

I don’t say you should trust them. 

I’m not sure what you are even trying address about where it synthesised - in no way have I said I don’t think it was made in Russia or said anyone could have made it. 

“Parrots Russian line” and “manic trot friends” is just stupid."
ukpolitics,fehe223,t1_feh9uxg,1579114630.0,"I don’t see the problem with this. 

He never said he would take their word for it - making them state if it was theirs or not could be incriminating if they deny it and are later found to have lied. 

I can’t see what you lose and you can’t seriously be arguing he thought maybe it wasn’t Russia?"
LabourUK,fe8oeeb,t1_fe8lbpe,1578928570.0,"We were polling up to 10 points behind in the wake of the GE. Tory vote drops and we stay steady/make small gains into low 30% - literally months of being just a few points of Tories and then boom PLP rebellion and our vote collapses off the back of a predictably pointless re-validation of Corbyns mandate. 

Did have a net loss of councillors but had a 2% swing - Tories were -5%. Can hardly blame much of WA and SP on Corbyn. 

It’s clear our polling tanked with the second leadership election and I will forever be livid about how desperate some were to harm our party if it meant harming Corbyn too."

holdmyfeedingtube,fdlan1r,t1_fdkwp12,1578519978.0,Remember reading a post on reddit about a cop who deals with them quite a lot. He was saying that quite a lot go between the train and the platform which causes their legs to spin and body to remain facing the same way. The pressure between the train and the platform compresses their lower half so they don’t bleed out. Sure if I remember correctly he talked about people being conscious for 45 mins plus and they know the moment they try to get him out he will just die. Although he said it gave them some time to get the family there.

Mind me asking how you ended up there?"
AskUK,fdjgekb,t3_eloydz,1578469672.0,"I love it actually. 

Got introduced to it on a few family holidays as a kid and always had a taste for it since. Often buy a 4 pack of Bunderberg if I fancy a dry night and something nice to have. 

Definitely an acquired taste but I like D&B too which I find quite similar."

I’m an advocate for a cheaper sausage in a fry up and don’t like mushrooms or tomatoes so this is close to my perfect. I prefer two slices of buttered toast as find it good for mopping egg yolk and beans - greasiness of fried bread doesn’t like my stomach that much either but it is delicious. I would also probably cook the black pudding a bit more but that’s also just personal preference. 

9.5 at least though imo. We should have a flair or something we can give to high level non-Brit fry-ups"
LabourUK,fd8ut6v,t3_ek0wtx,1578223684.0,"10/10 video. Getting quite excited about Starmer now, he seems to be ticking a lot of boxes."
LabourUK,fcxbpxm,t1_fcx4r6d,1578058498.0,"Yes and no. 

Depends if you look at the publication on mass (which I would have said is reasonably moderate-right) or certain contributeurs (where do I start...). 

Used to buy one copy of the NS and one copy of the spectator for holidays as liked to cover both sides and lots of palatable reading in both. Has been a few years though so wouldn’t be surprised if the magazine has shifted given the happenings of the last few years."
LabourUK,fcxbgrh,t1_fcx8pmb,1578058269.0,"Agreed. His willingness to listen to the further left of the membership has not gone unnoticed. 

As long as he continues to echo the positives about the Corbyn project and how it will be utilised and incorporated into next coming of labour then I will find it hard not to back him. He might be a bit met elite but he’s relatively slick and I think would make a good figurehead for older voters too. 

Obviously a lot to learn about the candidates with policy platforms, hustings etc first but think Starmer is doing everything right atm."

Interesting to see men vs women virtually the same - the implications are quite reassuring.

AskUK,fcrorl9,t3_eillsf,1577904599.0,"My friend bought a load of the cardboard stamp ones on eBay about 6 months before they swapped system (for this very reason). Basically spent his second term in halls eating solely quarter/half/whole Nando’s chicken. 

Best thing is, after he had been sent them, eBay contacted him to say the sale breached their guidelines and he was refunded the 30 quid or so it cost him."
AskReddit,fcnmuch,t1_fcmfk0w,1577814496.0,"Not OP but I believe that study or similar ones have accounted for socio-economic background / quality of insurance and found the same iirc. 

Also definitely still some dickhead doctors but think most doctors are unlikely to judge you for being a fat woman alone - there probably is some prejudice against poor lifestyle choices but if anything i would say doctors are a lot more understanding of the smoker who won’t quit/obese person who doesn’t exercise/diabetic who guzzles soda than the general public by far (doctors are terrible at looking after their own health).

I would say the number one prejudice with doctors is definitely impoliteness/entitled-ness. Although a normal person being grumpy would be fine, the patients who get the worse treatment are definitely by far the ones who are the worst to be around (demented/psychotic/delirious largely excluded but sadly I feel they are neglected because of this too). 

Just my 2 cents anyway, but interesting to read your perspective so thought I’d share mine."
AskReddit,fcnla9d,t1_fck3qc2,1577813701.0,"Hope you don’t mind me being a pedant but think you might have got yourself a bit confused on some of the details here, and if you’re talking about adenosine it’s actually a super interesting drug so keen to clarify/elaborate.

It sounds like you were almost certainly given adenosine. It doesnt really ‘stop’ your heart per se (although it can cause cardiac arrest in very rare cases) it does slow the rate significantly but still a long way from stopped (at least for anything like 30 seconds). 

I may be wrong about this but I wasn’t aware you had to use it immediately (although best practice to always not f around if you’ve taken something from a vial). You may well be right but I’ve never been in the position where someone’s had to tell me I need to hurry up and couldn’t find much online.

It is incredibly quickly metabolised though so you have to push it very quickly and then flush quickly to ensure it reaches the heart before it wears off which is unusual for a medication. It’s called chemical cardioversion (whereas using defibrillators in awake patients is called electrical cardioversion - this method actually does stop the heart for a very brief period). 

When we give this we always warn patients that they will feel like shit/they are going to die for a few seconds. Seeing someone having it is pretty awful - wouldn’t wish it on anyone from my experience but it’s pretty quick thankfully. 

Adenosine is also interesting very involved in sleep, and caffeine is actually an adenosine receptor antagonists (blocker) hence coffees effect on heart rate and sleep."
LabourUK,fcmqppk,t3_ei0lor,1577787509.0,Probably because (based on my past experiences) they know the defensive but vague reply they receive isn’t worth the time to complain.
AskReddit,fcjeod5,t1_fcj4s6g,1577684912.0,"I’ve had some success with the following tip. 

Basically set an alarm for about 2/3 hours before you need to get up. When it goes off, you need to spend like 5 mins awake. Long enough to wake up a little bit so you can’t immediately roll over and go back to sleep (but still want quite a bit of that sleepy feeling still). Then try going back to sleep as you normally would. Find this naturally induces them in me, and I’ve never done reality checks etc"
