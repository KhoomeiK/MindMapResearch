todayilearned,ffv65z3,t1_ffuddhu,1580256612.0,"> How do you evaluate the ""value"" of a ticket

The public sale tickets have a Recommended Retail Price.  That sets the base price.

Most tickets are ""sold"" in a trade package.  For instance, a sponsor will pay $250k for bronze level sponsorship for which they are given for ""free"" a box and 10 tickets.  These are typically auctioned at the start of a season, but sometimes it's a listed price.  The stupid simple formula is each of those tickets in the box is now $25k.  

NFL doesn't give seats away for free, there is always some income that might be coming at another part of the season or another part of the business.  Any stadium like this sells seats under the guise of packages or experiences, but it's cost per seat at the end of the day.

There is some retail mathematics to work out cost per ticket for big events like this.  You take all the income from sponsorship, tickets, competitions, etc and divide it by the number of seats.  It's how you work out if an Elton John concert or football is more valuable on a given day.

Companies will look at Stubhub or Ticketmaster resales for a ticket value comparison price.  Let's them know if they should adjust the price for next time.  The resellers also make a little money on the side by selling information."

Australia has no oil sands, no coal seam gas and relatively little fracking.  It's coal, iron ore and natural gas.

Start with [Engineers Australia](https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/).

In Australia engineers get fast tracked visas because the country is a net importer of those jobs.  However, it's mostly at the senior engineer level (roughly 5-10 years experience).

You are going to have serious difficulty competing against local grads.  For many years there has been a surplus of grads vs grad positions.  I think the latest 2019 survey has engineers at a 6 months on average for grads to find a full-time job in engineering.  Australia trains a bucketload of international students and they all want permanent residency - hint: mostly don't get it, the country just wants their education dollars.

Check ""seek.com.au"" (the largest job board in Aus).  You probably also want to consider directly apply for grad programs at some of the bigger mining and mining services companies.  For instance, Rio Tinto, BHP, Orica, Alcoa all have Canadian and Australia sites.  The reason I suggest those is they are big, plus jobs are in remote places that people don't want to take.  Think Alberta oil sands, but in a desert at 45°C or tropical rainstorms, or both.  They will sponsor a visa, you work for two years, then quit and move to a big city job.

ChemicalEngineering,ffea528,t3_et576c,1579840960.0,"> Do companies have to prove to the government that their operations no chance of emitting toxic chemicals in their products or waste streams?

Ha ha, no.

It's backwards.  Somebody has to identify a toxic chemical first, then that the company has it.  Some companies self report and even anticipate regulatory change, some don't.

It starts with generic local government regulations, then state EPA regulations, then potentially federal depending on where you live.  Each of those regulatory bodies has a list of HAZCHEM and limits for max. concentration and max. amount per day.  Some are annual limits, but stick with per day for a shorter story.

You can emit whatever you want as long as it is not on that list, is not in a form that is harmful or is below the upper limits.

At some point, maybe design phase, maybe after the fact if laws change, the EPA, OHSA, FDA or another regulator will audit the company.  That is the point companies will be asked to prove they are below any release thresholds.

Companies can be given higher emissions limits thresholds than everyday people for some substances.  One reason is a single stationary point source is less of a risk than multiple small sources.  A company may disperse a gas from a stack at a concentration that would be deadly from a car, but because the company stack is high in the air and well dispersed, that is acceptable.

Food and pharma is more complicated in that they need prove the product contains what it says.  But they don't have to prove there is anything that could be toxic.  For instance, a drug will be tested to make sure it contains 90-110% of what is on the label, but they don't check it for viruses or bacteria or heavy metals.  As an example, Zantac was recalled because it contained a potential cancer causing chemical, but they made that product for 20 years before anyone checked.

Major hazard facilities typically need to prove they won't blow up, or a spill can't happen or won't cause harm to the environment.  They need to prove maintenance is done, there are multiple failure modes and risks are assessed.  I don't think that is what you asking.

> To what extent do you need to determine the composition of products and wastes?

It's a positive identification for known stuff, not a search for unknowns.  If a company makes arsenic, biological waste and methane - they probably just check for those three things and any known contaminents / byproducts.

A common example is continuous monitoring by automated equipment.  Let's say every second a laser hits the waste stream to record turbidity.

Another is daily grab sample.  Literally one sample is grabbed from the line or stream per day.

Others are monthly or annual checks.  For instance, if a stack is continuously emitting smoke at a constant rate, it's okay to do a single annual gas composition check.

> How much unknown is allowed?

All of it.  If I'm not required to monitor, I don't.  For instance, I'm not checking my waste streams for lead, because I have no products or materials that contain it, nor any valid reason why it would be there."

Desert sand has the wrong chemistry, particle size, shape and distribution.

Desert sand is round and uniform in size.  It's like a ball pit at a kids playground.  It is usually smaller than 1 mm in size.  It often contains high chlorides that basically cause concrete caner later.  Round particles have a low surface area, which means it doesn't bond to as much concrete, so overall concrete strength is low, which requires more concrete to be used.

River sand is rough, jagged and many different sizes.  Average size is 2mm - which mathematically works out to be the perfect size for concrete.  It's like a jar of mixed nuts.  It contains very little salts as they have dissolved in the water.  The high surface area means there is lots of sand-> concrete interface so you get a nice strong material.

> What conditions are needed for desert sand to be able to be used in construction.

Wash it, then melt it into bigger lumps.  The process is called sintering.  You heat sand in a kiln just below the melting point and it merges into bigger lumps.  It's like when your cooking sugar gets lumps from humidity.

Downside, energy and water = money.  You either need big solar arrays or natural gas to run the ovens.

But the passengers feel fine and love the smell of stepping out into ""fresh"" air.

You can jump start your nose with some shocking scents.  For instance, perfumers add tiny amounts of horrible smells to jump start a nose.  Ammonia, urine, sweat and sulfur can all do this too.  A tiny bit of bad smell forces all your nasal receptors to flare open and then take in more of the good scent.

Here are [a few tricks to try and reset your nose](https://thenovastudio.com/4-ways-to-combat-olfactory-fatigue/).  The other one I know is to put your nose in the skin between your outstretch thumb and pointer finger for 1-5 minutes.  It's meant to smell neutral and reset your nose.

Since you say dog, ever been to a cat person's house?  They smell awful.  But cat people still exist and they stop smelling it after a while too."

A PhD will be a negative when applying for entry level roles.  You will be seen as ""too clever"" and likely to get bored, then quit.

I don't know what process engineer means to you, but be warned, to many people you are super over-qualified for an entry level process engineer job.  This is an over generalization - but most PhDs enter industry via R&D or as a technical expert.  You probably have to work quite hard to move into a process engineer role, competing against mostly BSc grads.

Be prepared to answer questions such as:

* won't you get bored working here?

* what sorts of future roles do you see yourself in?

* have you ever worked in industry before, worked to a deadline, killed a project, prioritized competing deadlines, etc

* you are probably 5+ years older than your colleagues.  Tell me about a time you were supervised by someone younger than you 

These will all be worded differently, but that's what they are asking.  Prove to us you aren't an ivory tower academic who couldn't get a academic position.  Prove you want to work in industry, with all the ups and downs that go with that."

You can google youtube videos of people using a filastruder to make composites.  Finely minced bits of solid plastic of any type, nylon fishing line, glass fibres, hair can work...  If you can somehow grind Lego branded building blocks into a fine powder, they work great!  Pretty much if it can pass through a flour sifter, it's good to go.

Fillers include minerals, such as finely ground sand, zinc oxide, calcium carbonate (calcite or chalk), graphite dust, pigments, clays.

Keep in mind any fillers will change the final properties of the material.  It can become brittle, porous, change colour of other undesirable properties.  But certainly fun experimenting.

If you have access to a twin screw extruder you can put in a huge variety of weird stuff and make pretty much anything into a pellet for feeding into the filastruder."

chemistry,ff1ptv9,t1_ff1o2ke,1579483504.0,"Rules to make an anti-smell product:

1.  Perfume, as a masking agent to create something nice

2.  Smell absorbers.

3.  Stuff to kill what is making the smell.

For instance, personal care deodorants contain perfume, anti-perspirants to absorb sweat and anti-microbials to kill odour producing bacteria.  

I thoroughly recommend you use your own perfume.  Those reed diffuser scent oils work, especially if you can afford to buy the essential oil concentrate.

Remember spraying is 3D.  To build a home made spray booth, get a big cardboard box such as an old PC box.  Remove the front and one side panel.  Spray from the open front down towards the sealed back.  It's a hack job, but you should see a nice even fan pattern with no big droplets or getting wet fingers if the spray head blocks.

I think I know what is happening.  [Relevent Scientific American article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/synthetic-fabrics-host-more-stench-producing-bacteria/).

Synthetic fabrics are homes to a specific bad odour causing bacteria called *Micrococcus*.  That bacteria doesn't like cotton or other natural fibres.

What happens in synthetic fibre clothing is you create a permanent bacteria colony.  Even after washing, 5-10% of the bacteria remain in the material.  Once you start wearing, making sweat and trapping bacteria food, the bacteria reporduce and make smell again.

There are two solutions that work, one of:

1.  Wash in color-fast bleach

2.  Hot wash at 95°C

Basically, you need to nuke the material from orbit, and regular cold wash with simple detergent won't do it.

Also consider sterilizing your washing machine once a month by doing an empty hot wash with bleach.  Your washing machine will also be a home for microccocus bacteria and be re-contaminating your clothes after each wash."
chemistry,ff1j8k1,t1_fel6fw0,1579480076.0,"FT-IR is the tool of choice for industrial plastics, paints, composites and surface coatings.

You can quickly ID the type of polymer and usually any fillers, minerals or additives.  By type of polymer I mean something like Dow-XXXX, not just is it PE or PP.  The fingerprint region <1000 wavenumbers is good for that - the region most chemists dismiss because it doesn't match up to functional groups.

For instance, with my FT-IR library I can take a paint flake and either fully of get really close to identifying the product using only FT-IR.  I can ID all of my own products, my competitors, about 12,000 historical product samples and quite a few contaminants.

Every few months I get an intern / slave labour to go around, buy a bunch of commercial products and populate the FT-IR library.  I can then sell that sample library back to the instrument supplier who on-sells it to other parties.

I buy really expensive sample libraries so the computer AI can do the search and product match for me.  Takes only a few minutes and is non-destructive."

Your numbers don't seem even close to believable.  While it's likely you may have a problem, those numbers seem wildly dangerous.

* The atmospheric NOx upper concentration limit in California is 2.5 ppm, one of the strictest in the world.

* A NOx concentration of 250 ppm will kill an adult human in about 10 minutes.

* A NOX concentration of 1000 ppm is equivalent to breathing in pure untreated diesel fuel (you know the blue cloud of smoke coming from a dirty truck exhaust, it's worse than that.)

* A NOx concentration of 2500 ppm is going to probably kill anyone within a few kilometers, plus the sky will turn brown and look like a volcano eruption.

NOx has an atmospheric half life of about 1.5 hours at ground level.  It's very reactive with water, soil, almost any surface.  It is not considered a persistent gas pollutant.  You can test this yourself if you own a diesel car.  Anytime I start my diesel engine inside the garage and drive away, the tingly NOx smell has completely faded within an hour.  There is poor airflow in the garage, but the NOx is so reactive it converts to other chemicals really fast."
chemistry,ff1dxfz,t3_eqjval,1579477945.0,"Ever seen someone who only considers ""Top X"" schools?  It's related to that, also money.

In international rankings (e.g. why Harvard and Cambridge trade off #1 on various tables), one of the criteria (among many) is what percentage of students and staff are international.  A higher percentage looks better, and the feedback cycle of higher rank = more internationals.  Schools will reserve a set number of places for international applicants.

Second is funding.  Education is a big business, in the billions of dollars.  International students often bring their own funding.  Sometimes to cover their own salary, more often to cover all tuition, consumables, travel, accommodation and the stipend.  Those really expensive student accommodation places at your school - those to milk money from internationals.  That means the school makes LOTS of money from international students.  Roughly, for every international student the school can fund one free domestic student.

The reason there is a bias towards domestic students is because that's why the schools exist - to train domestic students who will then go on to get jobs.  They are more likely to graduate and more likely to become alumni who then donate more money.  If schools didn't have to make money, they would prefer to skip the hassle of international students all together."

chemistry,ff19mmh,t3_er2da3,1579476591.0,"Any cyclodextrin will work to some extent.  

You determine max. solubility using a ""cloud point"" test.  To a container of water that is being stirred, slowly add cyclodextrin in 0.1 wt % increments and it will dissolve and the liquid will be clear.  Keep adding and at some point the liquid will look cloudy - that means it has become saturated and is starting to crash out of solution.  Overall: the max. solubility is 0.1 or 0.2 wt % less than the cloud point.

The surfactant (lecithin) has not effect on the cyclodextrin or odour absorbing properties.  The surfactant is only used to emulsify the perfume and to lower the surface tension of the final product.  The correct surface tension makes the product spray better and penetrate surfaces better (instead of beading up and forming droplets, which would be useless).  This one you do by trial an error by post-adding increasing amounts of surfactant to the final product, spray the product over a piece of brown cardboard and observe the spray pattern (e.g. big drops, spray angle, spray length, even vs focussed distribution...)

An ideal surfactant should be non-foaming.  Sadly, lecithin will make lots of foam and your product won't spray well.  An alternative home idea is to use baby shampoo.  That is mostly non-foaming surfactant.  You really only need a few drops per litre to optimise surface tension and emulsify any oils / perfumes in your product.

Fabric softener is mostly silicone oil and perfume.  I'd recommend not using that.  Your hypothesis of spraying oil to remove odours doesn't hold up and is probably causing stains on fabric.  It isn't absorbing any odours and is really only acting as an expensive perfume.

Please also include some sort of antimicrobial preservative.  Sugar + oil + water = bacteria food.  Your product won't be shelf stable without it."
