GirlGamers,ff6kk96,t1_ff0m6i4,1579629180.0,I only get on voice chat when I play with a group of people I actually know. Through different clubs and events I have been lucky enough to meet guys who I trust.

popheads,fer13gi,t3_eqbl83,1579348435.0,I’m actually surprised considering he was one if the first rappers to tell other rappers not to be homophobic. I still highly doubt that he is a committed Christian now. I also think they trash ass pastors are taking advantage of him and his star power.

NintendoSwitch,fegnv2r,t3_eolece,1579098287.0,I don’t use a screen protector and it has remained in good condition. I drop it all the time and there are still no scratches. The vents up top are breaking apart. My kickstand surprisingly is still sturdy. Joycon have wear on the sticks.

depression,fe66rjw,t3_cml6ni,1578883054.0,"So it’s time to face the fact that I really need help . I leave the house to only get fast food. Most of the time I’m ordering food delivery. It’s even painful for me to get out of bed to open the door for the delivery driver. Due to the excessive food deliveries I’ve gained so much weight. I’m always wearing the same clothes and I’m slacking with laundry. My hygiene has greatly suffered. I’m only 22 and I feel like I’m really just wasting my years staying home, but I’m also content with literally just dying in my room.  All of my friends are getting great jobs and considering marriage and I’m about to graduate in a few months and haven’t applied to any jobs. I’m really considering just living off of my trust fund and stay in the house forever."

popheads,fdo3i3m,t3_ematnx,1578598213.0,The Lizzo fat jokes are pretty heartbreaking. I understand that she’s overweight but there’s no need to tear other people down. The fact that ABC posted a meme about her being a bomb is so unprofessional. She’s still deserving of respect and that woman is up there singing and performing her ass off. I’m glad she’s taking a social media break but I hope she has a great support system

popheads,fdjw1bs,t1_fdgsa2l,1578489351.0,When she performed at Coachella it was packed as hell. She definitely needed more space. I don’t think she’s headliner status yet but I don’t doubt that she can pull a huge crowd. The issue is that her set list is only 45 mins

popheads,fclezd2,t1_fcj0t4f,1577746251.0,Same ! I think she’s so talented and was so happy to see her starting to do more televised performances. I made it my mission to see her live and she was great.
popheads,fclehk1,t3_ehsrl3,1577745928.0,Happens quite often actually. I remember streaming the hell out of Good as Hell in 2016 and then it was used for Drag Race. Now it’s in every commercial etc and I can’t stand it.

I’m not sure if it was being sarcastic but it was a quote tweet talking about why black people always run away when they laugh. They said “ Our ancestors on the cotton field would separate after hearing something funny... ain’t wanna cause too much noise around Massa. It’s genetic.”
depression_memes,fc0582d,t3_ef7xhl,1577279123.0,Well... you got me there. To be fair a lot of the excitement as a child was due to gifts. Now as a young adult you can buy whatever you want whenever you want.
