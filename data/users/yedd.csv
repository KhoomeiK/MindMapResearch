todayilearned,fffucqi,t1_fffooff,1579891982.0,"This also led to the birth of fruit machines, which were small machines located in the corner of pubs which dispensed limes and other citrus fruits. As it was natural for sailors to visit pubs and at the time were often at risk of developing scurvy.  
  
As it happened these pubs were often near ports where the limes were imported, so fruit machines became a way for the traders to sell their wares due to the huge demand yet keep staffing/effort costs low.  
  
  The popularity has continued to this day as a cheap and quick health benefit which enables patrons to easily garnish their drinks"

Nails are usually only used on brickwork long after it has fully set and is notoriously unreliable as bricks are quite brittle and the hole made by banging a nail in is usually larger than the nail. It's usually used to hold something temporary while work is being carried out. Saying that you'd never nail into brick, especially on facework. You usually stick one in the mortar where you can easily repoint if needs be, even then you can have problems, especially is the brickwork was layed using sandlime mortar which just crumbles like old hard cheese."

So I'm trying to focus on the head, which tbf was up there in the best I've ever had but I knew the slip road/off ramp was close and then we'd be on normal streets.
