Brawlstars,ffgm5cu,t3_etfsb6,1579909441.0,In the middle IMO. It's basically a better version of Gem Grab. Sometimes it is a bit frustrating when you are ahead but the enemy team holds their supers until the double points time and uses them to get control. It would be better if instead of 2x the points they made it 1.5x the points.

Intellectually as some people just have a greater capacity for memorization/comprehension than others.

As you mentioned, in every single sport that I can think of, the athlete can be better solely by having better height/cardiovascular system/etc for that specific sport.

I would guess that some people have their brains wired a different way than others that lets them learn how to play instruments and other skills. I would also guess that this, in the same way as intellectual ability, is influenced by a mixture of pure genetics and environment."
changemyview,feluxrs,t3_epucei,1579231564.0,"This is not really an attempt to change your view because I do agree with it. However, another reason I am against separating students based on learning types is that it is very hard to determine which learning fits a student best, and usually, this differs from subject to subject.

For instance, I am somewhat gifted in math and can learn from a straight up lecture on higher level material (higher level in comparison to the level of schooling at which I am), however, in English, I do not do well with a lecture. I do the best in English and Science with visual learning, not ""word"" learning."

nba,feilpbc,t3_ep6ac9,1579141461.0,It would be cool if he came back a game earlier for a showdown between him and Ja. 1 pick v 2 pick. 1 pick was undisputed for best player in draft but hasn't played meanwhile 2 pick has been playing very well and looks like the frontrunner for ROTY as of now. Also they both played on the same AAU team in South Carolina.
changemyview,feeb51i,t1_feciszo,1579030130.0,"I think hateful comments are wrong in (nearly) any context, however, my definition of a hateful comment may be different than yours. IMO a hateful comment is said solely to hurt the other person and for no other purpose. A comment may hurt someone, but not be hateful by at least attempting to be constructive. I don't agree with people saying ""fat people suck"" as this is a hateful comment, but I do agree with people trying to be constructively critical of someone who is extremely at an unhealthy weight for their metabolic rate. My reasoning follows someone else's comment below (I can't find it but I remember it from earlier) about anti-vaxxers and the fact that society views it as OK to constructively criticize (and in many cases be harsher) them, whereas their ignorance does not cause nearly as many deaths as heart disease, which can be caused by being overweight.

Sorry, this paragraph is long. Should've split it up a bit more."

changemyview,fechecn,t3_eoerpz,1578973973.0,"Some are, some aren't.

About the absence of comments on a skinny person: someone can be skinny because it fits the lifestyle they have (ie running, cycling a lot). Unhealthy ways of being skinny are not the only ways of being skinny. There is no healthy way to be fat unless one has an uncommon health issue that prevents them from burning the calories they need to burn.

About the most dangerous mental disorder being anorexia: I don't doubt it. However, the number one cause of death in the US is heart disease, which is, in many cases, caused by being obese.

I definitely do care if an overweight man has a heart attack. It is not fair for you to assume that strangers do not care about other strangers. I do not hate fat people, I just want them to take care of their bodies. I don't support the hateful comments, however, I do support it when someone has a view that being fat is bad. Why? Because I genuinely care for another person's life, and I don't think it is OK to normalize the biggest cause of the most common cause of death worldwide."
