BattlefieldV,ffn6ifg,t1_fflgpj7,1580062539.0,"They have apologized in the past, pretty much after big mistakes in the past few games. But it's a situation where continually doing so comes across as insincere for all sides.

EA finally pulled Dice all the way into the dark side."
BattlefieldV,ffn616p,t1_ffm5ydz,1580062407.0,"Looking on Wikipedia, Battlefront seems the only other game being worked on. I think it's clear Dice don't have the staff, resources and desire to fully support two games. 

Add in the massive complexity of Frostbite, and the pressure Disney must have placed on EA/Dice to properly support Battlefront2, and you can where things go wrong.

Lastly, add in the fractured and extremely poor management policies and ethos, and it all comes together in one huge mess."

BattlefieldV,fffaf4f,t1_ffeoqpv,1579879616.0,"Being reasonable, one would look at the entirety of Dice's work. Compare that to the data from the last three games.....all released with bugs, controversial decisions, apologies and ""never again\we won't let you down"" statements from Dice.

BFV is all these on steroids. They listen less, interact less, and produce less. The onky things to increase are bugs, game issues, and player dissatisfaction.

As is, Dice has been on a downward spiral for a while. Whatever the readons, if it wasn't for Battlefront (or maybe because), the studio would be in major risk of folding."
BattlefieldV,fff9jxe,t1_fff4pqi,1579879054.0,I think it's more like being done with Dice.

todayilearned,ffe49y4,t1_ffcts10,1579836309.0,"Yep....they initially had the ""ultimate battle"" concept, where they hoped to knock out the US in one huge naval battle. After Mideay, they were on the full defensive, but still hoped to make the the war too costly for the Allies."

BattlefieldV,ff9t07l,t3_es3qot,1579720607.0,"They clearly have a seriously limited staff, and probably just had some random person randonly adjust it with random skins. While no one is randonly keeping a log."
BattlefieldV,ff9se6d,t1_ff9eawi,1579720194.0,"I can equate BF fans to fans of a sports franchise. Nothing but love and glory when things are good, but utter dispair and ire during struggles. At this point, it's like being the fan of a team with a crappy, reclusive and unrepentant owner."
BattlefieldV,ff9s4h9,t1_ff9ea8q,1579719999.0,"But they take that extended breat EVERY year.....and always seem to drop buggy updates just before as well.

Think the worst thing I can about any professional, regardless of job, is they never learn from their mistakes. This is the THIRD game in a row where Dice released an apology and promise to do better, and yet it still happens. And whike they truly turned BF4 and BF1 around, they're too deep here, and lack the funds, desire and clearly the management to fix this."
BattlefieldV,ff9rpzc,t3_esctw2,1579719692.0,"BF is the onky franchise I truly connect with. Love a few other games (far cry, the division), but always come back. And honestly, as I get older, likely only a few years left of gaming.

I cancelled my first pre-order after the first trailer, but than got excited when I saw the second one and pre-ordered deluxe.......got screwed over twice, sone it glitched and never got to play early. Will never buy boins, nor will I ever pre-order/get deluxe, or buy the first few weeks.

So, on xbox, it's the only game that I connect with....."
BattlefieldV,ff9nkd7,t3_esd9vs,1579716733.0,"Totally agree!!! Sadly you'll get a few responses, but the community as a whole is focused on ttk And as another person posted, Dice are ignoring the real issue by saying things like ttk are the issue.

Yeah....it should take 6 bullets to kill me behind a wall, not one!

You have to add in the effect of high ping players, which bring out the netcode issues. But AE wont pay for proper servers, Dice wont run proper maintenance....and you have a holy confluence of issues wrapped in one ball called netcode."

BattlefieldV,feks4l4,t1_fejq5si,1579206466.0,Even worse when they add/change things without noting it in the patch notes.....like increased snap to aim assist on consoles (so snipers can get insta head shots from 200+ yards)

BattlefieldV,feh12zh,t1_fec0d0z,1579106925.0,"Late thought. The best protest will be not pre-ordering 6. Not buying deluxe (though they will surely sweaten the deal after the last fiasco), and not buying on release day. Only than will they truly 'get it', when the press picks up on the story, and corporate investors see profits flatten.

Not playing now may just lead them to reducing support, or coming out with another pointless apology."
BattlefieldV,fefbu73,t1_feey53n,1579052895.0,"Usually there are at least one person with a 140+ ping.....often over 200. Server goes to complete crap when you get multiples.

Many of us have only one real go-to, like myself. I'm on xbox, so I don't have access to many of the fine games on pc. There's also only one other game I've played (The  Division), and while it's a great game, it's a bit shallow.
