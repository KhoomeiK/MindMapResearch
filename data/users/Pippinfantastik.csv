I shop a lot at the Gap family, and all their things are returnable in store. Just not between normal and factory brands."

bulletjournal,ffp9v5a,t1_ffp8i9w,1580089774.0,Haha. Probably why I don’t do it that frequently. It sounds so... exhausting.

InteriorDesignAdvice,fff77m6,t1_fff730z,1579877459.0,"Sorry, forgot the sub. In terms of advice, the lamp color is really nice with the tones you’ve started, consider running with brass/bronze/gold for other accessories."

TooAfraidToAsk,ffdav7m,t3_essx0a,1579816893.0,I assume you’re asking because you’ve thought about seeking help. That means a little part of you is thinking that the part of your brain telling you negative things might be wrong. Being scared is the depressing part of your brain flexing its power again.
ketochow,ffd9rd2,t1_ffb8usl,1579816215.0,"This. Find another tablespoon and check them against each other. Cheap measuring tools are cheap for a reason and expensive measuring tools aren’t necessarily correct either.

askarchitects,fdqh83a,t3_emnjfm,1578666599.0,"Your final question hit the nail on the head. Like others have answered, it’ll be easier to understand the British Comonial architecture in places that have reverted to distinctly different local styles to show the difference. Look at those and you’ll get a pretty good idea of what happened with it in other places. 

Notice that the places where the language stuck, the architecture stuck. This can speak to how completely the British reign replaced what indigenous cultures were there."

askarchitects,fctvf2z,t1_fcte4gv,1577961539.0,"It’s certainly possible to do, although obviously not every homeowners dream. I’d start by looking for people who understand those systems. There will be the architects who can do it and the architects who have done it. Go for the latter. An architect with experience in renovation/retrofit will have the best concept of the transition between the two."
askarchitects,fctaqck,t1_fcta1yv,1577937490.0,"It’s all a part of building a high efficiency home. The architect can predict with relative accuracy how much heat you’ll need to produce to run the home with comfort. This will help you size your solar panels if you use electric heat systems (what my mind defaults to because my business does this), but it can also calculate out to pellets/cords of wood, etc. It’s the number that’ll be used for designing whatever HVAC system you go with."
askarchitects,fct9d26,t1_fcst6dq,1577936381.0,Sketching is one of the best ways to learn. Obviously not going to replace model building but it should be incorporated and used concurrently.

In residential builds the following standards are prob more what you’re looking for: Look for people who talk about net zero/zero energy ready (the government has a whole thing about ZERH you should poke around) and HERS, Energy Star, Passive House. 

The architect should take into account the siting for solar and will do a manual J for the loads. They can design for future solar installation."

I’ve considered breaking off a few times but once you have it set up it’s so simple to categorize etc. Their staff is incredible if you have any questions. They’ll look at your ynab and make a little video explaining things if you want. 

My husband is graduating residency this year and I can’t imagine giving up ynab but I’ll be picking up prob PC for the bigger money things now that there will be more interesting extras happening."
