rarepuppers,fecvzl9,t3_eofl6z,1578986811.0,Take to veterinarian ASAP check for parvo.  Could be why she was dumped. I have seen this happen before. Parvo kills puppies! Watch for diariaha. At first sign get her in quickly. Also get her microchipped ASAP. If you plan to keep. Beautiful pup! Take good care of your new family member.
dogs,feca6qm,t3_eoaa0y,1578969427.0,"As a humane officer let me explain. Your pet is already registered for life with the microchip company. If your pet is lost and then found, the company is called to get the owners information. If you paid the $20.00 fee, the company will call YOU directly. If you did not pay the fee, the company will reveal the owner to a veterinarian or a humane society. The advantage of payment is they will call you directly. That’s it. You should also be able to give another persons name and phone if there is a chance that you will not be available or on vacation. Either way you will be called!"

quilting,fe0dmfk,t3_en4r78,1578810978.0,I have never sold a quilt but would love to try. I might start with eBay because I am more familiar with it. At least until I start selling 1-2 quilts.

whatisthisthing,fdmlcrj,t1_fdlrnfd,1578554275.0,"When you use the same packaging that the meat is in at time of purchase and put it in the freezer as is, you run the risk of the packaging getting poked and as a result a hole which will give the meat freezer burn. I know this because I have experienced this myself. Meat is too expensive to simply plop it in the freezer.
Meat should be sealed tight in plastic, then sealed with freezer paper. Takes time but well worth it."
whatisthisthing,fdjdpwi,t3_elmi98,1578466560.0,Always put your fresh meat from the grocer in another package to freeze it. Takes more time but will preserve your meat better and longer. 71 year old mom. Spots are safe no worries.

offmychest,fcz0c8l,t3_ej599d,1578091077.0,I am sorry and I do acknowledge your feelings and pain about this situation. Because God gave us free will we sometimes walk down a narrow path to truths. It is only by faith that we can know him in our hearts. I can only ask that you sincerely ask Jesus to reveal himself to you through his word. He will give you the scripture to read and then give you perfect understanding. He has always loved you and he will reveal himself to you. I know this as fact from my own experience. He is real and alive!!
dogs,fcwgqfc,t3_ej8z1z,1578025191.0,No No No!!! This dog will bite again only next time it wont be a family member!! Do not find another home for this dog. He must be put down! Hindsight will not save the next victim. Dont allow another family to feel the same pain you are going through by re- homing your dog. I do apologize but it must be done for the sake of your family.
offmychest,fcwg56k,t3_ej8bt4,1578024758.0,"If you can, I would print every word of this out and give it to your dad.

offmychest,fcla41g,t3_ehn9d0,1577743111.0,"When I was in 6th grade, there were several boys that would call me ugly and would corner me against the school building shouting how ugly I was. After a while I believed them and would sneak up on myself in the bathroom mirror to see if I changed suddenly to an ugly person . It hurt me for a very long time. I am a 70 year old woman now and I still remember their faces and the pain of that time in my life"
