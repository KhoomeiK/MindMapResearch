Plastic bags aren't bad themselves, they are bad when not recycled or handled correctly

Realistically we don't have another material we can use instead of plastic to make bags

Like, paper bags are much more expensive, and environmental damage caused by switching to paper bags will be huge

We can use some sort of cotton reusable bags, but that will take its toll on environment as well, as you'll have to clear extra land to produce that extra cotton, and realistically, it'll take a lot of time before people would use reusable cotton bag for shopping

But there's much more - plastic isn't only in form of bags, there are other forms of plastic packaging as wraps and films and such, and frequently there's no real way to replace that

Plastic is so huge because it's really good, it is cheap to produce, its production scales up easily, you can manufacture produce wherever you want so logistics is very simple, etc.

Right now humanity has to keep enormous population of cattle, pigs, chicken, once we move to lab-grown meat lots of these won’t be needed

And despite whatever most people think, we don’t actually “waste” most of resources, we transform it from one form to another. Generally, we are living in somewhat isolated system. Most of our energy (and tbh all of our energy) is a product of the sun. We still receive crapton of that energy on a daily basis.
