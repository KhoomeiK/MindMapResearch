BabyBumps,fdaaypf,t3_ekemwt,1578243902.0,"I had my first three children in ‚Äò02,‚Äô03 &‚Äô04.   It was hard and yes I was tired, but the pregnancies went just fine with absolutely no issues.  No previa, no high blood pressure....no issues at all.  They did watch me a little closer but that was it.  

My DH made sure I could rest when he was home and I made sure I ate correctly and took my prenatals.  I was even nursing through each of them and had no issues with preterm contractions because of said nursing.  I loved having my first three close together...it was fun to have them all be so close and they are best buds now as teens. 

The most important to remember is to listen to your body, if you are tired rest (if possible) , if it hurts tell the doctors and most of all be kind to yourself...being super mom does nothing more than wear you down.  Your little one won‚Äôt remember if you two napped frequently or didn‚Äôt work on shapes and numbers. 

Congratulations on your little one and future little one ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"

PublicFreakout,fcs4fvh,t1_fcrj8wu,1577911325.0,"I have no interest in MMA fighting as I am a parent and have better things to do.  

As far as my hands..nah but my open and conceal carry permits come in handy lol 

Know how you don‚Äôt upset people...don‚Äôt start putting your hands on me and I won‚Äôt feel the need to protect myself.  Not compensating at all... I merely said the worker had the patience of a saint and I would have knocked her ass down if she laid hands on me.   See in that situation she started it and continued laying hands on that poor guy.  I would not have had that level of patience and would have dealt with it.  

Why do you feel the need to single me out...did your mom call you up from the basement keyboard warrior and now you feel the need to lash out?  I hope you have a wonderful New year."
PublicFreakout,fcrei9j,t1_fcq78s0,1577900751.0,"Actually no.  

I am an Army veteran and am able of taking care of myself.  I do not tolerate people disrespecting me or my loved ones.  It would be over the second she laid hands on me.   

But thanks for assuming you know jack shit about me there hoss."
PublicFreakout,fcop6kj,t1_fcooaia,1577837894.0,"Exactly.   No one wants to see anything that crazy dirty bitch has.  

She would be laid out she put her hands on me.  That guy has the patience of a saint.   He doesn‚Äôt paid enough to deal with shitty people like her."
legaladvice,fco81ml,t3_ei8gg6,1577825854.0,"Yes she can call the police and yes you can get into trouble.  


Call the police department or go down there and ask them how to handle this.  Tell them you‚Äôve been telling her to get her stuff and need it out of your home.  She is refusing to come get it and what should you do.   They will tell you where to go from here on out. 

If it were me and the police agreed, I would put it into a storage unit , pay for a month (or two depending on the law) and give her the key(mail it if you need to (signature on delivery)and keep the copy of the key incase she says it didn‚Äôt get there).   She is trying to make your life hell and is succeeding.   

Get a paternity test (to cover bases since she is acting shady) and get a custody agreement in place since these actions are going to piss her off further.   She has shown she will escalate things...believe it is coming and plan for it.  Cover your ass."

personalfinance,fcb0kw3,t1_fcaz6v0,1577580301.0,"Also the title says $40,000 in debt and since he/she refinanced her debt increased by $14,000.  She has a negative cash flow and is spending what I do on a mortgage for storage.  

The big picture says something more is going on than someone who is just bad with money."
personalfinance,fcb07a5,t1_fcaz6v0,1577580078.0,"Is she storing 737 parts or something?  Do you think OP is going to be able to convince her to get rid of everything and downsize?  It was just my first knee jerk reaction.  

I hope OP can convince her to do what you suggest.

Why does she have three houses? Does she rent them out? She could sell the two she isn‚Äôt living in but again...she doesn‚Äôt seem to concerned about her situation."
personalfinance,fcaz1ww,t3_egyrvb,1577579437.0,Bankruptcy.  It would take some serious work on her part and honestly I don‚Äôt see that happening.  I know you want to help but sometimes all you can do is be a listening ear. I‚Äôm so sorry . I can only imagine the stress this is putting you under
ThatsInsane,fcawmd7,t3_egxuuz,1577578064.0,"That poor bus driver.  I drove buses for our local school and hated winter time for the fear of this happening(Washington state). 

I just hope the bus did t have kids on board."
pregnant,fcasrb2,t3_egrp2v,1577575883.0,"Giving birth is not a spectator sport and at that time it is about you , your husband and baby becoming a family.   

Your parents,in-laws and whoever else thinks they have a right to be there can go take a hike.  

You have to focus on having a baby and trying to be modest because you have a group hanging around isn‚Äôt relaxing.   It amazes me at the manipulation they tried pulling on you‚Äù be really upset if you call them after‚Äù...I wouldn‚Äôt call them till I was home after that little ditty there.  

I‚Äôm sorry for being harsh but you can tell the nurses at the desk that your husband is the only one besides medical personnel allowed in your room.  Let them be the bad guys if you can‚Äôt keep family from barging up there.  

I hope you have a quick and safe delivery and most of all stress free as possible"

AmItheAsshole,fc69k16,t3_egfmyt,1577475407.0,"NTA.  Your friend has been trying for quite some time to have a child and finally gets pregnant but did not plan for said child....who the heck does that.  

She is obviously acting out for her family to either back out or not offer at all.  This speaks volumes to me and honestly would have made me run for the hills. 

She can be pissed at herself for being such a beast that no one wants to organize a shower for her and that didn‚Äôt set something aside for this planned child."
