You left him, and now he's desperate to get you back to alleviate the feeling of rejection. It has nothing to do with you as a person or girlfriend (I'm sure youre wonderful but he could never truly appreciate that anyway) it has everything to do with his self esteem."

OP chose to use the word love, it just seems kind of Petty and invalidating to go ""oh that's not love, I know what real love is because of xyz"" 

This person is important to them and  I just don't think of any of us are qualified to tell them that what they are feeling isn xx't true or real, because to them it is.

aww,ffcjsmx,t1_ffcdlza,1579800966.0,"In theory yes, but what often happens is that the expression of certain genes become linked, so you can't get rid of the undesirable trait without breeding away from the trait you are trying to get. For example, almost all dalmations in the US have issues with urinary infections and stones, becuase that gene is unfortunately linked with the genes that cause spotting. In the UK the UKC is less strict that the AKC, their dalmations are actually healthier becuase they allow larger ""patches"" on the ears and the AKC does not. Thus the UKC has a wider gene pool and better success breeding away from the health issues endemic in the breed."

When my dad passed in my mid-twenties we did a green burial where he was wrapped in a shawl, then buried in a shallower grave (3 ft instead of 6). We carried him out, laid him into the grave and filled it in ourselves. Now every year we plant native plants on it and the whole area is set up for native plant restoration and protection. It was so much better for me than a traditional burial or cremation where the family has basically nothing to do with the body.

I would say no replacing fish or corals when they die, slowly downsize that way. If you can try to get him more focused on freshwater tanks- they are much less expensive and easier to take care of than saltwater.

I think that just like anything else with the potential to be addictive (weed, booze, video games ECT) it really depends on the person using it.

AskMen,fea3du8,t1_fe92f9l,1578943916.0,It's not uncommon to have problems sustaining an errection without porn if you have a porn addiction. Some people who are addicted have this issue and others don't. Some develop it at some point along the addiction.
AskMen,fea2tfi,t1_fe79uqz,1578943789.0,"Porn is extremely mentally stimulating, it's designed to be that way. Excessive use can desensitize you to real life sex because it doesn't fire up your nuerons in the same way. When you keep repeating activities (especially ones that are rewarding like porn) it creates nueral pathways that are easier for your brain to follow, and basically makes it easier to become aroused from porn than real life. People who quit porn often find themselves having a better sex life, more intimacy, are more likely to approach others, and more happiness in their relationships. Some men can experience ED that is related to porn use. Also, relationships where one of the partners uses porn regularly divorce more often."
AskMen,fea16is,t1_fe9i3mw,1578943274.0,There have been several studies on porn use that show negative effects on the brain and on relationships.

relationship_advice,fe93v4v,t1_fe6spoz,1578933893.0,"How old are you? Your advice sounds like something a 14 year old would write after reading too many MGTOW threads. I don't think you've ever been in a truly equal happy relationship otherwise you might realize you don't have to show dominance and fight your way to the top to be happy. The fact that you think it's ""fun"" to use mind games to break someone down shows how immature you are and makes it clear that anyone looking for a happy partnership should avoid any advice you give. Reading OPs post it's clear he's a decent human being with empathy for his girlfriend, which means he probably wouldn't get off on being cruel like you appear to do.

Besides, it's pretty clear that OPs girlfriend is too insecure and emotionally immature for a working relationship right now. Playing mind games that appear to be designed to make her even more insecure won't fix that. She needs to work on herself before she's ready for a partner- just like you!

The techniques you describe will work on some people, but the people it works on are either seriously lacking in self respect or addicted to drama or both. And it will never make for a happy relationship."

relationship_advice,fdrq0el,t1_fdr3gls,1578688011.0,"A strip club is a form of brothel though. A LOT of clubs turn a blind eye to dancers selling extra services in the VIP room, and some clubs encourage it. Even if you're going to get a lap dance you're paying for sexual pleasure from a stranger. 

To be clear I feel that sex work should be legal and sex workers should be destigmatized. I have friends who are sex workers. But I sure as hell won't be staying with my husband if he engages the services of any type of sex worker, including strippers.

relationship_advice,fdrm00w,t1_fdqtmxw,1578686383.0,That's great that you and your partner have a relationship with similar boundaries that appear very relaxed. If it works for you guys that's awesome. Every relationship is different and different boundaries apply. As long as both partners agree to those boundaries who are you to tell them that's better or worse than the way you do things? Just because you and your partner have different boundaries doesn't make your relationship better
relationship_advice,fdrkxgs,t1_fdqafpx,1578685966.0,"A strip club isn't harmless if it's outside the boundaries they have agreed on for a relationship. IMO it's a very reasonable boundary.

It's wonderful that your mother gave you such a good understanding of the consequences that can come with being sexually active, but not everyone gets that kind of upbringing. The young woman in this story certainly didn't handle the responsibility of sex well, but that doesn't mean that every 15 year old is irresponsible if they are having sex, either. It's not like people reach 18 and are suddenly adults who don't make mistakes and are responsible now. People mature at different rates and to make a blanket (and judgemental) statement about the maturity of all 15 year olds is simply innacurate.
Also, claiming that the pregnant girl was lying about a being on birth control to trap OPs son? Big assumption with no evidence."

relationship_advice,fcvqlrp,t1_fcviesp,1578007882.0,"I wasn't responding to OP, I was responding to another comment. I may have been making my point with a personal story but the experience of maturing significantly from the ages of 20 to 30 is pretty universal. I wasn't offering OP advice because she has clearly made her choice, and even though I think it's the wrong one, it is HER choice. I was engaging with someone else who doesn't understand why there could be a problem with someone dating a 20 year old when they are 33. 
I'm not ignoring the fact that she was legally an adult when they started dating, I was pointing out the differences in maturity. 

The reason so many people are focused on the age difference is because it's likely relevant to the story. Her brother clearly has an issue with their relationship and the age difference is a likely culprit. I don't think that the brother expressed his concern in a productive or appropriate manner, but he has reason to be concerned. To pretend that the age difference doesn't effect this story at all doesn't give you a clear picture of what's happening here."

Dating a 20 year old would be repulsive to me, I would feel like I was taking advantage of them. We would have absolutely nothing in common either.
