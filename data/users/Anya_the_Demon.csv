JUSTNOMIL,ff72q99,t3_erxrz7,1579639942.0,"The fact that you even are aware of this and want to curb it is KEY.

I understand that you just forgot, but that was a serious problem.

Meet you somewhere for a vacation etc. Would it be nice if you made it out to visit him once a year? Sure. That would be great. But, it would be equally nice for him and his family to travel to see you and your parents etc. If he wasn‚Äôt giving you a hard time about it, I would just say NAH, but since he‚Äôs trying to guilt you over it while he hasn‚Äôt made any efforts to find ways for you guys to see each other, he‚Äôs the asshole. Try suggesting a family vacation somewhere equally accessible to you both. See what he says to that. If he shuts it down, then he clearly doesn‚Äôt want you in his child‚Äôs life THAT badly."

But, since IS hard to pack your shoes without setting them down on the floor first, you might want to provide your guests with plastic bags or something for them to put their shoes in for packing. Otherwise, are they going to have to, what, bring their suitcase down to the front door and shove all their shoes in at the last minute, with their suitcase reopened at the door? How do you pack your shoes without putting them on the floor? Do you keep them on a shoe rack and then put them straight into the suitcase? Does your guest room have a shoe rack available? Where should she have put her shoes while waiting to pack them? If you want someone to adhere to your standard for shoes never touching the carpet, you have to provide them with alternative systems. I was going to vote YTA, but since she argued with you about it when she should have just asked you for something to put her shoes on on the floor etc, I‚Äôm giving it ESH."

But planning to introduce a baby into a family where you already know s/he won‚Äôt be welcomed and lying about it etc is a TERRIBLE idea. If your family is so dysfunctional that you can‚Äôt have a healthy family conversation about this and make a decision to welcome this baby into your home collectively, then you should NOT be adopting this baby.

AmItheAsshole,fedsni2,t3_eona2e,1579019039.0,"YTA!! Lol, the fact that you tried to vote NTA on your own post speaks volumes. I think you‚Äôre going to lose a friend over this. I understand what you‚Äôre saying, but you‚Äôre basically making a choice. You‚Äôre choosing your morals and beliefs over your friend. On one hand, that‚Äôs fine. You‚Äôre entitled to do that. If you had done it gracefully, I would have voted NTA. But your post was SO AWFUL. You come off as pretentious and judgmental and holier-than-thou. Had you said to your friend, ‚ÄúFriend, I love you and I would like to find another way to support you for this big event, but you know how passionate I am about protecting animals. I just can‚Äôt attend a wedding at an aquarium.‚Äù And then asked if you were the asshole for that, my vote would have been different.

AmItheAsshole,fdyr1sh,t1_fdyqo2e,1578782725.0,"Sounds like your mom has learned to pacify him in order to avoid his anger, which is sort of both sad and smart, since it‚Äôs probably how she copes.  Your dad is 100% in the wrong and needs therapy but will probably never ever get it.

AmItheAsshole,fdkgvtn,t3_elpvjj,1578503612.0,"NTA. He is being a shitty father and husband (no pun intended, lol). If it‚Äôs a serious medical issue that is interfering with his life, he needs to seek medical attention ASAP. To not do so would be irresponsible. It does not, however, sound like that‚Äôs the case. Sounds like he‚Äôs found a creative way to dump all the work onto you.

I mean, it doesn‚Äôt sound to me like you realize the magnitude of what he did to her. You‚Äôre still of course allowed to want a relationship with him now, but it seems like you‚Äôre just glossing over the truly selfish thing he did and what that must have done to your mom. Now he gets to just waltz back into your life and be accepted and loved? If I was in your mom‚Äôs shoes, I would 1,000,000% be losing my mind over this. She was even younger than he was, but she didn‚Äôt abandon you. She did all the hard work.

I know that cutting ties is painful and that there‚Äôs this deep-seated feeling most of have, where we feel a hole in our lives if our family isn‚Äôt there. But your family is toxic and is causing harm to you and your siblings. I am so sorry. You have to do whatever you can to protect yourself and stay sane."
AmItheAsshole,fcja5v0,t3_ehh53j,1577681115.0,"NTA. Your boyfriend SUCKS. Dump him. Get a new boyfriend or just focus on your friends. Really, he is a seriously lame and shitty boyfriend. He isn‚Äôt even really a boyfriend at all."
AmItheAsshole,fcja2ds,t3_ehh6pv,1577681041.0,"NAH. No assholes here. The trip just bombed and you two have a LOT of work to do on your communication. It sounds like she was really uncomfortable and unhappy and didn‚Äôt want to talk to you about it. It sounds like you knew she was really uncomfortable and unhappy but didn‚Äôt know what to do about it. If you can‚Äôt communicate better with each other, then this relationship will be over soon."
AmItheAsshole,fcj4qep,t3_ehgdrk,1577677235.0,"NTA. Do not, under any circumstances, use that money to buy your parents anything beyond normal birthday presents etc.  You are still suffering because of that accident, and the money is for your future. If your dad is trying to hold you to a promise you made as a small child - then that is seriously fucked up and manipulative."
AmItheAsshole,fc9p4v1,t3_egramz,1577556047.0,"ESH. Yes, that girl and her family are the worst - but why hadn‚Äôt you ever addressed this with them and the school before? How was this the first time you‚Äôve met with her parents about this? You‚Äôve been remiss in dealing with it. And OF COURSE there was going to be drama when you invited the entire grade except one girl. I mean, come on. You had to know she and her parents would flip. You need to deal with the bullying issues proactively."
AmItheAsshole,fc7b6d2,t1_fc7ay11,1577502390.0,"Ok, as long as it is 100% not postpartum depression, then NTA. It sounds like the two of you need to have a serious family meeting where you make some agreements, perhaps get some couples counseling. But, if she was like this before you had the baby and she shows no interest in changing, then there‚Äôs not much you can do. She sounds selfish, or maybe just immature, and disinterested in doing basic adult tasks. I‚Äôm more worried about your toddler‚Äôs development than anything else. Can you get him into daycare?"
AmItheAsshole,fc79aye,t3_egkl3a,1577500944.0,"INFO: has she always been like this, even before you had the baby? Could she be depressed?"
AmItheAsshole,fc796km,t3_egkphl,1577500849.0,"NTA. I‚Äôm so sorry. This is a terrible environment that you are in, with some terrible people. Is there a counselor at school that you can talk to after break is over? What would happen if you simply said, ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt work for me. You need to make other plans.‚Äù And just repeated it over. And over. And over. They yell and say you need to do X. You just say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. That doesn‚Äôt work for me. You need to make other plans.‚Äù Stop trying to convince them or justify it. Just say no and stick to it. They don‚Äôt care about your reasons and they are unreasonable. Take care of yourself work on establishing boundaries and not letting them treat you like a doormat. Look for other adults in your life that you can talk to for support."
AmItheAsshole,fc78v8d,t3_egkpw9,1577500607.0,"NTA. If she won‚Äôt even compromise or be reasonable about this, then good luck with the next 18 years and 9 months."
AmItheAsshole,fc78rcz,t3_egkqhp,1577500529.0,NTA. He‚Äôs feeling sorry for himself and wants you to play the loving daughter. He doesn‚Äôt get to have you at his beck and call.
AmItheAsshole,fc78nfg,t3_egksag,1577500449.0,"ESH. Those are definitely issues you should address with him, but I don‚Äôt think you should call him a burden or that he is a burden. Those are just issues to talk to him about. It sounds like you could both benefit from working on your communication skills so you can talk through these kinds of things."
AmItheAsshole,fc7890d,t3_eggx3b,1577500153.0,Wow. Your husband is an insensitive asshole. NTA. He really needs someone to set him straight. Let‚Äôs just pretend that you WERE being unreasonable (even tho you are NOT). This is something that is upsetting to you and SUPER easy to fix. His choice to belittle your feelings and then make you feel worse by blaming you for making everyone else uncomfortable is... just wow. He is actively choosing to be unsympathetic and cruel about something that hurt you. He is selfish and self-centered.
AmItheAsshole,fc77lph,t3_egeunk,1577499672.0,"NTA. Your body, your business."
AmItheAsshole,fc77hjd,t3_egd6l8,1577499585.0,NTA. Your parents misled you. This is their fault for overbooking their home and not having a room that was appropriate for you to sleep in.

AmItheAsshole,fc66lwh,t3_eg5c4x,1577473455.0,NTA. Don‚Äôt move into the new house with this guy. These are red flags. He wants the house to be ‚Äúhypoallergenic‚Äù for when he resells it? Wants to force you to give up your beloved cats? Nope nope nope. Dump his ass.
