schizoaffective,ffdgz8z,t1_ffdf1j7,1579820658.0,I’m sorry if that reply had seemed rude in  any way. I was kinda caught up in looking things up and trying to really understand the situation and I wasn’t thinking of how I say my words. Thanks for the input. We got her meds adjusted a bit bit of nothing changes in the next few weeks then I may talk to her about switching to a different med instead of increasing this one even tho the only change has been more and more tiredness.
1200isplenty,ff9cv9y,t1_ff9494v,1579710166.0,I’m a weirdo and just eat avocado out of the skin with a spoon. But what you do sounds super yummy and I want to try it.
1200isplenty,ff9cqla,t3_esc06d,1579710066.0,I can’t do this on regular toast as I am going back to keto but I can do this on my keto English muffins that desperately could use some flavor.
AnimalsBeingDerps,ff9cfpw,t3_esajrc,1579709836.0,So precious
bipolar2,ff9c83z,t3_escb7p,1579709677.0,I’m so so sorry you and those in the comments feel this way. I am a caregiver and one who has mental illness but I also have a safety net of people who take me out of my situation even just for an hour and distract me from myself or even allow me to indulge and be a little irresponsible to help me feel better. It is really hard if you are doing the self caring all the time by yourself and have no reprieve. I hope you can find a way to get the recharge you need.
bipolar,ff7jxqa,t1_ff7jus9,1579651311.0,Thank you. That is a good thought to keep in mind.
bipolar,ff7jr77,t1_ff7eeld,1579651187.0,"I understand your need to mention her autonomy because a lot of people have experienced being medicated to benefit others, myself included, as one who also suffers from mental illness (just mine is nowhere near as life altering as hers has been). I appreciate you mentioning it because it shows you care and are willing to advocate for a stranger and that means a lot to me. 

She has always been very clear headed and articulate. In fact at times too articulate and self aware and some doctors have been unsure about diagnosing things when she was younger. Now she is lost, confused and feels like she is in her own version of hell. She is going through a lot of mental stress because of her experiences and that is what made me step in. I have always advocated for her and what she wants even when her husband disagreed and did not listen to her wishes. A big reason why she wants me to have control over her medical decisions so that she feels even when she can’t decide I will decide based on her wishes."
bipolar,ff7izpx,t1_ff7buyd,1579650669.0,Thank you so much!!!
bipolar,ff79wep,t1_ff6t4pk,1579644162.0,"Last year, even after she got better following her first hospitalization she said she was still having bad mental days 5 out of 7 days of the week that I could keep track of. She always had to keep her mind occupied or she felt like she would start slipping back into her psychosis. I didn’t look for a change of meds at the time because it wasn’t that bad still and she handles the hallucinations quite well. Her biggest problem is the delusions which she experiences every time she sleeps as dreams."
bipolar,ff79nuk,t1_ff72ddu,1579643987.0,"Ok. I hope so. It makes me worried, she’s terrified of going back to the hospital and I am not getting enough sleep before work. So it is all culminating into a very stressful situation."
bipolar,ff79kh3,t1_ff77ufq,1579643918.0,She used to be on 10mg a day but after this last hospitalization she is on 10mg in the morning and 15mg at night. And upon researching depakote it also has drowsiness and confusion as side affects.  Which is what made me reach out.
schizoaffective,ff6ruwh,t1_ff6r96a,1579633574.0,If you read the other replies you would see that she is already on meds. She has been on zyprexa for a little over a year and they just added depakote after this last hospital stay.
bipolar,ff6enk9,t3_errqnu,1579625545.0,"I literally just had a discussion like this with my sister. She believes she is not bipolar (was just diagnosed at her hospital stay a couple weeks ago) and is actually depressed with psychotic symptoms. The problem is, both times she was hospitalized she was manic and then went fully psychotic to the point where it was dangerous for us to keep her at home so we had to take her to the hospital. She swears that this last time she was not manic but it seemed pretty manic to me. I don’t know how to talk to her about it without her getting upset at me. She feels that if she has bipolar she is crazy because of her own stigma of the illness. So it seems she is trying to downplay it to something she is more comfortable with. It is hard. She also believes her depression is more dangerous but the two times she has tried to commit suicide were when caught in delusions during her manic episodes."
itookapicture,ff6dpm5,t1_ff5fyau,1579624959.0,You are very right
bipolar,ff6d9pr,t1_ff3l9bv,1579624682.0,"What meds were you on? My sister has been dealing with some narcoleptic like symptoms. She has no issue falling asleep (more issue staying awake) but her delusions take the place of dreams (more like nightmares) and she wakes from them completely lost in the delusion and it takes 5-15 minutes to get her to clear. But like, she falls asleep the moment she closes her eyes sometimes and in some cases is already dreaming 3 seconds after closing her eyes (not exaggerating this)"
bipolar2,ff441od,t1_ff3yah4,1579555071.0,I have been told by multiple therapists I show signs of adhd but I have never been diagnosed. So if interested me that this was mentioned. I agree it is important to not self diagnose
bipolar2,ff43ov1,t1_ff3iltv,1579554851.0,That’s good that you two are going to counseling and handling the trouble before you take the final step. That is very smart of you.
1200isplentyketo,ff3dtos,t1_ff3bu4e,1579539087.0,"❤️❤️❤️ also, since you are so early on in your diet it is ok to cheat now and you will just have to start your transition over. You haven’t really started losing fat yet, just the water that is stored for processing glucose. So when you break it you will gain that water back but it will flush again when you transition again. I hope you feel better soon. You are doing something positive for yourself. That is something to feel proud of."
bipolar2,ff3dhyl,t3_er4qrq,1579538926.0,Then that is definitely something that he needs to work on. Are you two already married?
aww,ff3cs50,t3_ercfak,1579538564.0,I love the names! I have a Mephisto.
1200isplentyketo,ff3anz7,t3_erf4u8,1579537501.0,"I was on keto for 3-4 months. I broke my diet for a month this December for the same reason (I had a death in my close family and my partner was hospitalized for two weeks) and only gained back 12 pounds. I’ve noticed that if you break the diet after being on it more long term you stay in that mode longer. Before that I went off for a weekend and I ate bad food and still lost 2 pounds after the 2 days. Just, once you are done handling your mental then get back on the horse and keep moving forward."
itookapicture,ff39mjt,t1_ff39441,1579536925.0,Looks like one side that may have been affected by the fires vs the other side that hasn’t? It’s a great show of destruction and creation. At least that’s what I got from it.
tarot,ff396ke,t3_er3ie0,1579536641.0,This is such an awesome idea! I kinda wish there was an actual tarot deck made like this.
schizoaffective,ff38lwa,t3_er6qze,1579536265.0,Congratulations!!!! That is definitely something to be proud of. Keep pushing forward!
bipolar2,ff38d0l,t3_er4qrq,1579536099.0,Hopefully the counseling will help. I hope you guys can work it out. No one should be put through something like that. It seems like he is gaslighting you using your illness. That sort of thing is usually an abusive manipulation tactic. If the counseling doesn’t start helping then maybe you’re better off without him. Having a partner that does not understand what you are going through and doesn’t put the time and effort into helping you through your illness is damaging and something you don’t need.
bipolar2,ff378sy,t3_ereq9h,1579535356.0,"The same for me happened but with music and phone games I played when my sister was hospitalized for crisis. I go to them and I get instant anxiety, pressure on my chest and I feel sick to my stomach. This is less true for the latest hospitalization as we have a little bit more of a handle of what’s going on but especially true for the first one because we were ignorant idiots who didn’t know what was happening and why. 

I hope with time the music that was ruined for you gets better again as your grow and develop past that feeling for you."
bipolar2,ff33bxf,t3_eraegv,1579532602.0,"Wait, is constantly losing things an ADHD thing? I lose my phone no less than 5 times a day cuz I never remember where I put it down and sometimes the places I find it confuse the hell outta me."
schizoaffective,ff276n4,t1_ff21wsr,1579495762.0,She just barely got on meds for bipolar three weeks ago. So I’m hoping they don’t need to be raised again.
bipolar,ff22adf,t3_eqtsfr,1579491866.0,This is a great idea. I think I will do this for my sister for our pets and close friends and family and write about what was happening in the pic. I’m hoping it might help to ground her more when she is feeling to floaty out of her head.
schizoaffective,ff20ggs,t1_ff1q18d,1579490511.0,"She is my universe. There is nothing else I could imagine doing.

Also, thank you for the info. It is good to see when others are experiencing the same thing. It helps her not feel so alone when I tell her about what I find out from others and it directs my efforts in figuring out what to do best to help her. 

Was there anything that helped you?"
bipolar,ff1kvtq,t3_eqye8y,1579480824.0,I LOVE the dot work. This is so beautiful.
schizoaffective,ff1jk3k,t3_eqyyf5,1579480216.0,My sister has been dealing with that and I experience it on a much less drastic level.  My sister was just recently released from the hospital after a crisis. Nights are the worst for her as she dreams very vividly and all her dreams have been of her delusions. She stays in my room with me so I can wake up when she does and clarify things to her and explain what is real and what was dream otherwise she gets incredibly confused. This is something we are trying to figure out how to handle when happening surrounding crisis for her. Normally she can clarify it on her own but it is harder when her psychotic symptoms are stronger.
schizoaffective,feiamyp,t1_feg8773,1579134048.0,We are in the US. I think she worked enough but her husband can support them both. But she needs someone to take care of her and Altho he can support her he can’t pay for a caretaker.
schizoaffective,fefr26v,t1_fe3lqgp,1579062738.0,My sister cannot work due to physical chronic illnesses. But we still haven’t been able to get on disability. She needs someone at home with her to help but her husband and I need to work so she pushes herself too hard.
