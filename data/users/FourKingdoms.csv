authors,febr48r,t3_dokzrv,1578961753.0,"Oh my, that must be terrible! But remember: the actions of your parents and relatives don't define who you are. Make a story if you want too! You shouldn't let that creative brain of yours go to waste! Everyone has a writer inside üôÉ"
authors,febql8a,t3_encobn,1578961621.0,I would recomend animal protagonists si.ply because I believe it is harder to write inanimate objects for characters. Not saying you shouldn't though! It is totally up to you. Check out my books at https://robertavasquez100.wixsite.com/website
authors,fe6ddj8,t3_ehw6ml,1578887623.0,Should we just email each other?

authors,fe6bbom,t3_d1l6b3,1578886081.0,"Depends on the characteristics of the character. If it is a character with a sweet and kind nature, I'd reccomend healing powers. And if the character was a rebel, I'd imagine something like teleportation. It really depends on the character, in the end."
authors,fe6b6ma,t3_d3cw3f,1578885976.0,I would also reccomend buying a planner or using your calendar to manage the time you spend on your book. I typically write two hours a day or more.
authors,fe6b3q0,t3_d3cw3f,1578885918.0,"Yes, I have many tips! You can actually visit some websites and find your ideal idea to stop Writer's Block. Don't give in, please.

authors,fe6aca1,t3_ehw6ml,1578885362.0,"Yeah, that is the difficult part. I still have trouble as an author trying to find and send the emails fo everyone. Maybe you should just stick with a social media platform. üòÖ"
authors,fe6a3sn,t3_ehw6ml,1578885195.0,I'd reccomend having a social media platform much like this one to promote your book on. I also think you should try to promote it by email. Your welcome üòä
