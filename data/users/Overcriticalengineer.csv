UpliftingNews,ff6g1oq,t1_ff6fgdd,1579626410.0,"Not OP, but missed mental health check (not an active check, only looks for adjudication [mentally incompetent] or involuntary committal to an asylum) and that there’s a private sales exemption for background checks.

“Any person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of the State where he resides as long as he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law.”

Futurology,fdxrtlk,t1_fdxqwkp,1578772257.0,"Very true. I should mention it runs deeper than just the measurements and methods, but the institution itself. If there’s a racist policy that arrests more black men than white men, and sentences them to longer terms or higher bonds, the algorithm (particularly learning algorithms) can codify that racist policy.

You’ve never been with someone who was disappointed with your reaction or the way you say “Thank you”, ask “What’s wrong?”, and then not let it go until you tell them?

AskReddit,fc2weqs,t1_fc2oogy,1577375827.0,"So, controversial, but. We don’t know what the person said, it’s being paraphrased as you mentioned.

Models take a ton of time to assemble, paint, and touch up. People also typically don’t casually put together models, so they’re probably serious about it. They may have a favorite brand of model as well. The model also has to be displayed somewhere, they don’t get binned once finished.

It more sounds to me like the OP as someone unfamiliar with models bought something for an expert, and there’s a possibility they couldn’t disguise their disappointment well enough."
