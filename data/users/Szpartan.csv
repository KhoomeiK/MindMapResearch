That damn finale though. I even was happy sad for Erin finding her parents. Though.... How did they just know because they saw her? 

Like did they know who she was the whole time and saw her *""famous""* and tried to grub? That irked me as I hope that's not the case but in my head, they're shitty parents and only care now that they think she'll have money from the show."
