AskVet,ff3ulu1,t3_erd7o7,1579549196.0,"Have you seen a veterinary neurologist or had an MRI performed to rule out other causes of seizures besides epilepsy? When was the last time you had a phenobarbital level checked and what was the number? It's possible that your dog's seizure medications have room for adjustment or that he needs additional seizure medications as it sounds like potassium bromide and phenobarbital aren't quite enough. Did your vet give you an at-home rescue protocol with his medications, knowing that he tends to have clusters?"
AskVet,ff3tkuw,t1_ff3chg4,1579548559.0,We had the same thing happen with a cane corso
AskVet,ff1yxua,t1_ff1xinm,1579489412.0,"Yes, shouldn't make her feel poorly but can cause some sedation. Pain medications wes see affect kidney/liver tend to be NSAID medications like rimadyl/metacam/previcox (and their generic forms). I'm sorry about your pup."
AskVet,ff1wczg,t3_eqsq7b,1579487673.0,Did you have any radiographs performed?
AskVet,ff1vxnw,t3_equs4h,1579487392.0,Any new neurologic change in a pet warrants going to a veterinarian. Please ignore the other comment you received as this is bad advice and it is up to a vet to determine if your pet needs medication or not. The fact that your dog has already had several of these episodes within 24 hours means that likely some medication may be needed.
AskVet,ff1vl3p,t3_equlf2,1579487160.0,I would video these episodes and consider seeing a veterinary neurologist.
AskVet,ff1vbfq,t3_eqyx3w,1579486986.0,"Is there an emergency clinic attached to your neurologist? If so, I would take your dog there if she keeps crying out and having difficulty walking. This sounds unrelated to her seizures, but typically the emergency clinic will have access to an on-call neurologist if they have questions about a case."
AskVet,ff1ullm,t3_er2fz9,1579486539.0,"I'd start with a visit to your vet, but know that a visit to a veterinary neurologist may be needed in the future."
AskVet,ff1tsif,t3_er3zq7,1579486016.0,"Neither of those medications are hard on the kidneys. In fact gabapentin is incredibly safe and pets can stay on it for years with no kidney/liver side effects. Tramadol isn't typically prescribed long term just because it's a controlled substance. I would honestly give both if they were prescribed, as they have different methods of pain control."
AskVet,fdypi0n,t1_fdxx20j,1578782238.0,"Typically if you go through a good round of medications and rest (2 to 4 weeks) and he is doing great, but then you stop medications and let him resume normal activity and he becomes painful again.. then that is an indication that he has failed medical management and a visit to a neurologist would be indicated. OR if he is on what your veterinarian would seem a good pain regiment and he still continues to act this way and be painful, then you might want to see a veterinary neurologist.

In the off-chance that this is a back pain issue, I would recommend that you cage rest him. No running, jumping on/off the furniture, rough play. Just rest and brief walks out to go to the bathroom and back inside (and when I say brief, I mean no walks around the neighborhood). If he has a crate he likes being in, it would be ideal to keep him in there or in a small room to minimize the chances of him jumping on the couch or something when you're not looking. Rest is a pivotal part of medical management, so it may have to require some tough love for a bit to give him the best chance at healing."
AskVet,fdxtuk8,t3_enbv7y,1578772866.0,"Being a dachshund mix dog, there are issues they're more prone to like IVDD. The only comment I have to make on this post is that I think it's important to explain that normal spinal radiographs do not rule out a back issue. Radiographs only show us the bones of the spine and can rule out a fracture/subluxation or certain types of cancer. However, radiographs cannot show us a herniated or bulging disc as the intervertebral discs are soft and jelly-like. The only way to rule out something like that is an MRI. If he continues to be painful or suddenly becomes wobbly or drags any of his limbs it would be highly recommend you see a veterinary neurologist."
AskVet,fdxsa72,t1_fdu236q,1578772423.0,"There are many types of neurological issues that can cause seizures or seizure-like episodes. Epilepsy in itself only presents with seizures and no other neurological issues. There are also conditions that small/toy breeds (and especially LWD's or ""little white dogs"") seem to be more predisposed to such as autoimmune meningitis which can present with a wiiiiide variety of symptoms from seizures to abnormal episodes.. blindness.. mentation changes.. neck or back pain.. paralysis.. etc. Some dogs may have mild symptoms and others may be severely affected. If these episodes continue, you may consider seeing a veterinary neurologist for a second opinion. Just because he doesn't have problems walking or orienting himself doesn't rule out a neurological disease."
AskVet,fdtiusi,t3_elxp8o,1578717389.0,Did you do an MRI? That's the only way to rule out a neurological cause of seizures.
AskVet,fdtihwb,t3_em0nxt,1578717240.0,"Pet insurance is very common. That being said there are important things to know about pet insurance- mostly that any health condition they have had will be excluded from coverage and most companies have limitations on how old they will sign up a new pet (most cut-off at 10 years old). What company you choose really depends on what you're looking for.. some cover alternative therapies (acupuncture, for instance), some have wellness coverage for vaccines/dentals/yearly bloodwork, some have yearly caps and some have lifetime caps, some will not cover your pet after a certain age. Trupanion pays SOME vets directly, most you pay up front and get reimbursed. I personally have Healthy Paws for my own pets, but you should shop around and see what you feel is the best coverage for your pets needs."
AskVet,fdtfjqw,t3_emtrtm,1578716036.0,"Also, I mean this in the least snarky way, but why did you not notice a difference in a medication you had regularly been giving and question the vet about it sooner? Yes, it was wrong and a mistake for the vet's office to fill you the wrong medication and I am in no way trying to rectify what they did, but why were you not prompted to call your vet when your medication went from a small white capsule to a large brown tablet? In the future, definitely always ask your vet about major changes you notice in your pet's prescriptions."
AskVet,fdfo7q3,t3_ekg1uo,1578366251.0,"I would find a veterinary neurologist in your area. The only way you will likely know 100% what is wrong with your cat though is advanced imaging such as an MRI. If that's out of your budget, a neurologist will still be able to give you some differentials based on their exam and recommend medications."
AskVet,fdfne8e,t3_ekmyj9,1578365713.0,"It can take up to 2 weeks for the ""drunken""-side effects to wear off. Just hang in there."

AskVet,fcsl2u0,t3_ei6m8b,1577918782.0,"If your vet said it's herpes virus, then it's very likely. Cats with herpes virus can show a wide variety of symptoms and usually will have flares during times of stress."
AskVet,fcskk5z,t3_eibrgs,1577918448.0,"What is he taking it for and how much? At most it causes sedation at higher doses, but should not affect vision."
AskVet,fcsjwxo,t3_eifok6,1577918049.0,What food is she on and how much is she eating? Do you do measured meals or do you leave food out all day?
AskVet,fcsjprg,t1_fcr86p1,1577917936.0,"Without knowing the dogs weight and exact doses of medications, it's hard to say  if the medications he is on are appropriate. Seizure medications have a very wide range. Has the owner had a phenobarbital level to check what level the medication is at in his dog's body? Typically it is done 2-4 weeks after starting the medication and then again every 6 months. If the level is low, it's an indication the medication is subtherapeutic and needs to be increased. Is he giving the medications on time and not off by several hours or missing doses? Also, some dogs have what is called refractory epilepsy and require 4 or 5 seizure medications and still may or may not have good seizure control. A dog on seizure medications is always going to have seizures, but the goal is to increase the time between seizures (in a case such as your friends dog, starting with seizures being 4-6 weeks apart would be ideal).

Nothing about your friends dog is ""extremely unusual"", all that is common in a dog with seizures (although I doubt your friends dog is having seizures for 10 minutes or it would likely not be alive. Seizures (the actual paddling/convulsing part) become an emergency situation at 5 minutes as they can go into status epilepticus and can suffer heat stroke). What is happening here sounds like an unmanaged epileptic. I would suggest your friend see a boarded veterinary neurologist and not just their general veterinarian."
AskVet,fcsihal,t3_eigyti,1577917135.0,What are the medications that were prescribed? Did they do any bloodwork?
AskVet,fcsi7wp,t3_eikmz8,1577916993.0,He needs to be seen by a veterinarian.
AskVet,fcsi4fj,t3_eiks6n,1577916943.0,You can also use boiled pasta or boiled potato.
AskVet,fcshohf,t3_eiloao,1577916722.0,"Do you keep plants or flowers in your house? Have children that could be dropping things like raisins/grapes? Take prescription medications or ibuprofen/tylenol/etc that could be dropped? Do your cats have access to a garage? Are they indoor/outdoor?

Also until bloodwork is ran, you don't know this cat has renal failure. With his habit of eating things he shouldn't, the vomiting and not eating could be from something such as an intestinal blockage.

While I'm sorry this is happening, my honest advice would be to stop getting cats if you cannot afford vet visits and have to surrender them every time they're sick."
AskVet,fcsgl2y,t3_eimeha,1577916219.0,"The issue with his leg is unrelated to the surgery or the snake bite based on the timing (you mention the difficulty getting in the vehicle, sliding out, and abnormal gait prior to the surgery). Your dog is having a neurological issue. The knuckling on his hind foot is known as a proprioceptive (CP) deficit and indicates a problem somewhere between the signal coming from his brain to the nerves that run off the spinal cord. In an older boxer dog this could be several things (degenerative myelopathy, herniated disc, neoplasia). I would book an appointment with a neurologist in your area so they can evaluate him. He may require advanced imaging such as an MRI to diagnose the cause of his ataxia."

We've had some owners say ""when they start having seizures, that's when we'll stop"" and others who let their dog go until it loses the ability to walk or do basic things like eating. I will say a year or more is very rare for a patient with a large tumor that is only doing palliative care (i.e no radiation or surgery). Be aware of worsening signs in your dog such as seizures, difficulty standing or walking, loss of learned behaviors like urinating in the house, no longer recognizing you, sudden aggression, vomiting, not eating, head pressing against walls or furniture. Timing is completely up to you, but think about how you want to remember your last days with her. Do you want her to still like cuddles and want to eat snacks and recognize you? Those are happier memories of your dog and you can make her last day on your terms and feel better about it and feed her cheeseburgers or whatever you want! If she is having frequent seizures or can't even stand up or is trying to bite you/your family.. are those the last memories you want of her?
