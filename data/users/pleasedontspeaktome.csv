You have no idea how accurate this is. You have to understand, when I am in Japan, I'm generally not in downtown Tokyo, or a super touristy area, I am in suburban Japan.  Practically no one  speaks English, and are not used to dealing with tourists, just regular people going about their daily lives.

In the first couple of months of living there, I began to learn sequences of questions, rather than the actual questions themselves; you buy a bento and the shop assistants will ask ""would you like to heat it up?"" ""would you like chopsticks?"". You remember the basic sounds and how to respond. Until this one guy NEVER asked if I wanted my bento heated up, so every time he was on, I ate my bento cold. So, out of pure necessity I learned ""atatamete kudasai"" (please heat it up).  Times that by 1000, and that's how I learned Japanese out of pure necessity."

todayilearned,femadt1,t3_epsvd0,1579245856.0,"Everytime I catch a Shinkansen I get reminded of how awesome they are. The last time was in July 2019 from Shin-Yokohama to Kyoto for work. The trip is about 2:15, about twice as long as a plane. However, unlike an airport, there is no lining up, you don't have to get to the station an hour before, there is no security or boarding procedure. You just show up, buy a ticket from a machine, train pulls up, you step on, and it pulls away. Then, you arrive in downtown Kyoto - not an hour away at an airport! 

We are planning a trip to Kagoshima in May. It is 7 hours by shinkansen, or 2:30 by air. We are going via shinkansen. By the time you add up traveling to the airport, all the check-in and security bulshit, I'd rather be sitting on a train with free wifi!"
todayilearned,fem9mt5,t1_fem31fj,1579244921.0,"I moved to Kanagawa in 2003, didn't speak any Japanese and lived there for about 3.5 years. As you said, no Google maps etc back then. I think a credit to just how easy it is over there; I had a fold out train map in my room, and all stations have those giant maps with all the fare info and routes. I never got lost once!  

I do recall that in the time that I lived there, websites did pop-up that would work out routes for you that were super handy. 

I still go back annually for about 4-6 weeks at a time, and having a smartphone has made it even easier."
