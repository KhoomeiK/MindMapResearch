wewantcups,ff843wi,t3_erv9ih,1579665466.0,"Ugh my family (parents) are so pro-waste I hate it. I made coffee in a coffee cup, and she’s telling me to use one of the foam coffee cups that are disposable because it’s so much easier, even after I said I’m at home and just eating breakfast, seems really wasteful, she couldn’t understand. Took me like 15 seconds to clean it, like, why? Maybe if I was going somewhere sure, but she’ll use them around the house for no reason. It’s sad. :-("

badwomensanatomy,feiu0jj,t1_feglq7p,1579147184.0,"My best friend started her period in 4th grade, she came to me, knowing I had mine, I was (for some reason) very regular a year in (kinda rare), and didn’t have any on me, but I walked with her to nurse and the nurse supplied her and I helped her know how to put it in, I’ve had to borrow idk how many in high school, and I always have extra, it would be really nice if they were there if needed, our school didn’t even have the vending ones in the bathroom. :-("
hulaween,feitr25,t3_epawbu,1579146987.0,"Also, pretty sure you won’t be able to sell that “officially” unfortunately, and selling outside is gonna get your wristband at risk. :-( I like to sell prints but gotta be real sneaky, and try to just sell to friends/people who wander to campsite, but I’m super cautious. Most vendors who sell any type of pipe sell it on the down low, it can cost their vending license at the fest. :-( even if it’s for tobacco"

childfree,fdg1icq,t1_fdg1ae3,1578376594.0,"He wasn't pressuring at all (i was 16 at the time), his was just sharing information lol. I just thought it was funny, he was in no way telling me to have a kid to burp again but that would have been insane. Also, I'm allowed 2 cans of beer/soda/carbonation (not back to back) a day with no ill effects. Also, husband doesnt seem too disturbed by my many farts daily."
childfree,fdf2dbk,t3_el0tev,1578351729.0,"I’m incapable of burping *something to do with my upper back/lower neck shape*, and my chiropractor (who asked me first, and I was surprised he knew I couldn’t burp), told me sometimes it’s fixed by pregnancy just because of all the gross movement that happens, but yeah I’ll take minimal carbonated drinks and avoiding bubbles thanks."
bigboobproblems,fdex743,t1_fdes8uj,1578348492.0,"In high school I was a buddy/curvy girl. (Not large at the time, just big bust and big hips and thick legs. Kinda wish I still looked like that), and our English class was curious why some girls got caught for clothes and others didn’t. I lived in Tripp pants and band tees but I volunteered to be in this experiment. We both wore Aeropostale polos, buttoned all but top, both in dress code but close to not. She was slim and not busty, I was. Same color, shirt etc different sizes. Then a skirt that was just 1 inch over what was allowed, same skirt, same “fit”. Wore it once a week for a month, I got “checked” with a ruler over 8 times, she never did. It’s weird man."
TooAfraidToAsk,fd7cx1s,t1_fd6ylbp,1578202527.0,"Orgasms (multiple or one) do lift my mood medicated or not, but not enough to “get rid” of depression by any means. (I have major depressive disorder), it’s easier to orgasm when I’m in a good mood, and medication makes arousal harder, but mostly it comes down to: orgasming is easier in a better mood and when relaxed, which is generally true for everyone I believe. Orgasms are not near a cure for depression, but it obviously makes my mood better for a while. Medication lowers my libido, so I want it less often, and it’s harder to get aroused, but not impossible. Idk if that clears it up at all."
thesims,fd6sy8f,t1_fd5nw4u,1578195323.0,I played sims 2 as a kid and wasn’t allowed to woohoo so the only kids were made in create a sim. Never had a baby lol. Strict parents.
TooAfraidToAsk,fd6qrrc,t1_fd6o27r,1578194573.0,"It’s always been that way but I generally am in a greater mood for a few days following an orgasm. I used to take SSRIs and stuff but lost insurance and had to taper off, currently unmediated, and I couldn’t orgasm on any of my past antidepressants (all ssri) without much work, and never really multiple."
JUSTNOMIL,fd6io4d,t1_fd3sqq1,1578191623.0,"Agree completely. It took me a year to kick the habit completely (without rehab but husband and I together), but being open and honest with relapses and having a support network was key. (Our out of town best friend and our lovely boss who told us to call him anytime we need to!)"
TooAfraidToAsk,fd6frdd,t1_fd5l4el,1578190309.0,"Just takes longer but yeah sometimes it’s impossible but I’m in medicated depressed, but sometimes it just takes more foreplay to get turned on etc."
TooAfraidToAsk,fd4m2gz,t1_fd2hvmw,1578168818.0,"I have severe depression and anxiety, and this only works if I’m 100% feeling normal. Depressed and anxious me struggles to have an orgasm at all. :-( But like when I’m in a good (rare) mood this is wonderful, and if I’m depressed or in a bad mood an orgasm can 100% turn the next few days around. Not sure if that’s helpful but that’s just how it works for me."

boomershumor,fcz2nyv,t1_fcxwven,1578092433.0,"My husband prefers I don’t, I had shaved up until two years dating him and he got drunk and was like “not shaving would be more comfortable for you, and it might make life a lot easier”, then I asked if he prefers it, and the sweetheart he is was like, “well a bit yeah but you can do whatever you want.” He forgot the convo entirely and was so excited when it grew in, like hell yes less work for me and you love it.

Only thing I miss is that alcohol relaxes muscles and I’m in pain a lot, can’t afford medical card (do qualify), and in illegal state so the setivas here don’t do anything for pain relief."

I immediately screamed “if I have to cut my hair he pays for extensions until it grows back” but luckily we unhandled it... turns out they “accidentally but totally didn’t have to” break his toy in the process of saving my hair. This kid was an asshole and older than me so..."
