I mean, I'm sure it's going to be very miserable and it's doubtful I can refuse treatment without anyone interfering so easily, but the thought that I only need to endure it for a short, if torturous while, and dying without killing myself, is more tempting than reasonable.

depression,ff5bvh3,t3_ermt16,1579586602.0,"Yes, of course. Whenever I slip up and say something too personal my instinctive reaction is to anticipate it to be used against me. It doesn't matter with who, how close we are or how long we've known each other. So I've learned to sort of put labels on parts of my life, and shove the untouchable ones into a deeper place. Honestly it was pretty easy because of the feelings associated with those parts are undesirable feelings, it's like shoving rotting carcasses back into the hole they belong in."

This was after she put in her book that he raped her after his botched cosmetic surgery (I think it was related to his scalp). As for the part with him being illiterate... Well, I'll argue he CAN read on some level, but he's functionally illiterate, that is, he struggles to read after certain level, I'm talking somewhere past 6th grade here (there had been reports about aides having to simplify reports with more visual aids and less words, also sprinkle his name throughout to keep his attention), and you've seen his numerous typos and limited vocabulary in his tweets. These two claims are not as baseless as you think."
