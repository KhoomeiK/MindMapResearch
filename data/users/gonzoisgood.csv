AskReddit,ff95i6a,t3_es53p0,1579705321.0,"An old friend of mine told the same stories of her ""old life"" over and over and over. She used to be rich and married to a powerful man and she told the same stories of her ""Glory days"" so many times I know them all in detail. They had been separated for years when I met her. (She was a loving friend to be fair and unfortunately our friendship ended when she descended in to a pretty nasty drug habit. She's doing better now and we remain in occasional touch.)"

AskReddit,fetqobn,t3_eqfgfg,1579378476.0,"Basically any Noah Baumbach film doesn't for me but 'While We're Young's, 'The Squid and the Whale' and 'Marriage Story's never get old to me. There's also 'Frances Ha' and Jack Black I'm 'Margot and the Wedding' is just great. Noah's films feel like real life."

AskReddit,feg2mqk,t1_feg2ant,1579074223.0,My fiance dreams every night about extreme violence. He is afraid to sleep and if they're particularly gruesome they can ruin half his day. My dreams are abstract but to him they feel totally real. Just hate it for him. I'm sorry that you deal w this too but I dig your outlook. Good luck to you .

AmItheAsshole,fefzq1z,t3_eon6gr,1579070846.0,NTA. Firm NTA.
AmItheAsshole,fefz9ee,t3_eoq0fz,1579070338.0,NTA. Kids make noise. They run and play and giggle and shriek. I hear kids outside my house playing constantly at the near by park. I've never once asked their parents to keep them quiet. My neighbor has a baby that sometimes cries LOUD. So I bought a fan for white noise. You live in the neighborhood and your kids should be able to live freely and play (and long as you're not letting them literally scream their asses off). I think I would have handled things in a nice way until dude suggested I moved. So in my opinion no NTA.
