fantasybball,fgke2cb,t1_fgkayzo,1580863398.0,"What I said was that they didn't NEED both, not that having both wouldnt be beneficial in your scenario. My problem with their fit on offense is that Russell shouldn't be limited to just shooting and secondary playmaking/shot creating, especially if not many pick and rolls are being run through him. His shooting is good, but can easily be replaced, and like you said, Draymond can offer some extra playmaking. You might not be able to replace that extra shot creation by trading Russell, but to your point, the defense would be an issue if he stayed. Put DLo in Minnesota and his value is maximized. He's the primary ball handler, he has a fantastic pick and roll partner in KAT, and his shooting would be needed to provide space for KAT and occasionally Wiggins. So, to be clear, Russell CAN play for the Warriors hypothetically, but his value on the court in Golden Stste would not be nearly as high as it could be in Minnesota."
fantasybball,fgkanhc,t1_fgkagws,1580861159.0,"I would say so. Hes not the most flashy, he's not gonna sell tickets, and his numbers might not be super impressive, but I would say he's just as valuable to his team as a borderline all star would be"
fantasybball,fgkahce,t1_fgka26i,1580861047.0,"Ok but Russell isn't as effective as he was last year. Sure he's putting up numbers, but the warriors are terrible and Russell's advanced stats are down. The fact of the matter is that DLo is at his best when he is running several pick and rolls per game. Also, next year, they will have Steph back to do all the things that DLo is doing now, eliminating the need for both of them"
