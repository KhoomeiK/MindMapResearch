AskReddit,ffbfca3,t3_espgfl,1579762835.0,Not really a question but I remember watching A Beautiful Mind back in 8th grade and wondering if my my life was just a delusion.
NintendoSwitch,ffapq1x,t3_eslgwc,1579741596.0,I would if I were you. Since you already have a gaming PC and all.
iamverybadass,ff8f4tc,t1_ff8c5fn,1579675801.0,No it's simple. First he simply has to get a girlfriend then he simply has to wait for her to simply flirt with somebody in front of their families (both of them presumably) then he simply must kill them. Simple.

politics,feel9g1,t1_feel339,1579036036.0,"Lol the source you refered to actually supports my statement. Either way Chappelle publicly came out in favor of Trump. That's the definition of endorsement bro. Just because he ""changed his mind"" doesn't change the fact."
politics,feeky4h,t1_feekb82,1579035852.0,It is actually. Nice wiki reference btw. Very convincing.
politics,feejto7,t1_feeje3f,1579035199.0,That's actually the definition of endorsement. It doesnt matter if he was already elected. Neither does it matter if he walked back on his statement. If anything it just shows he truly doesn't know what he's talking about.
politics,feeig8m,t1_feefiia,1579034403.0,"I believe he told people to ""give Trump a chance."" That's an endorsement in my book."

therewasanattempt,feb1530,t3_eoapx2,1578954409.0,I honestly don't think anyone could be this stupid. They just couldn't be bothered to try which makes this data kind of useless.

quityourbullshit,fe6eokf,t3_enyncy,1578888667.0,Here's my guess. Google told them it was snowing in Washington (state) and I guess they couldn't even be bothered to check.
todayilearned,fe5hssw,t1_fe5g5uj,1578869590.0,"Sorry I thought I was replying to someone else so I deleted my comment because it didn't make any sense. But hey thanks for being a turd about it. 

Anyway, it's actually far more likely that the thieves themselves weren't the ones who made the music. They likely just stole the equipment to turn around a sell back on the street. So the people who bought the equipment from them can really only be considered second hand or unwittingly thieves. Which is exactly the same thing as piracy. You may not have been the one who ripped it off but you still accepted ownership knowing you had no legitimate right to."
todayilearned,fe5f65p,t1_fe5e5xx,1578868738.0,How is producing music on equipment you didn't pay for any different than producing music with software you didn't pay for?
todayilearned,fe5ccdw,t1_fe5aanp,1578867650.0,"Chances are the thieves themselves weren't the ones making the music, most likely they stole the equipment to resell on the street as quickly as possible. If you still think that makes them thieves and you not one, then you're just a hypocrite."
todayilearned,fe59qcz,t1_fe57qw9,1578866897.0,Nope.
todayilearned,fe56t5u,t1_fe50ln6,1578866131.0,I'm not saying that it is. I'm just saying don't judge if you've also done unethical things to get to where you are.
todayilearned,fe55swk,t1_fe51n05,1578865899.0,I never said that it was.
todayilearned,fe501m2,t3_ensk1m,1578864411.0,Don't judge. I know a lot of you on here got your start in game/graphic design or music and film production with pirated copies of various software.
OSHA,fdua1zo,t1_fdu8uge,1578730184.0,"Ah, yeah. Fuck. I meant to say regardless, which I shouldn't have said anyway. Too late now."
JusticeServed,fdu8ufc,t1_fdu7oi2,1578729583.0,I think even Texas requires you to at least notify the police when you've shot or maimed an intruder. That was probably these peoples biggest mistake.
OSHA,fdu7jnh,t1_fdu5ilx,1578728954.0,Believe it or not but I have been cold before.
JusticeServed,fdu64nr,t1_fdu4led,1578728239.0,"You cannot justify a theft with a beating. Even the ancients believed in ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth."" Not a tooth for a limb or a bicycle or some shit. Also the fact that these people didn't report (and I'm using your words) ""THE CRIMES"" destroys any chance they might of had of proving their innocence or intents. Man, these people were fucking dumb as hell."
JusticeServed,fdu49x7,t1_fdu3nfm,1578727273.0,I've never heard of that guy so I don't know. But I think in this both people deserved to be charged. One crime doesn't justify or offset the other. It's simply just two separate but related crimes.
JusticeServed,fdtyxct,t1_fdsacoq,1578724539.0,"I'm not defending anyone's actions here but they were literally ""luring"" people with the full intent of beating them if they caught any. It's kinda hard to maintain your innocence if the act was entirely premeditated."
JusticeServed,fdtyks6,t1_fdsg05v,1578724371.0,I mean... They were literally using the bikes as bait. That isn't hyperbole.
OSHA,fdtkbsv,t1_fdtd0og,1578717996.0,"I mean, it's still a torch bro. I get that it's a one in a million shot but still... Seems like an unnecessary hazard just to be *maybe* slightly warmer."
OSHA,fdtiv18,t1_fdswkdi,1578717391.0,"That just seems excessively unsafe. It would be like using a circular saw as a desk fan in the summer to cool off... Sure it works, it's just that there are better, less lethal ways to achieve the same result."
OSHA,fdtheb3,t1_fdt0uzx,1578716793.0,That's not the same thing tho.. A grill is a specially designed unit made from metal and shit. Whereas this is just a torch dangling off a ledge.
OSHA,fdsm7su,t1_fdslhq6,1578705023.0,C'mon man. It's just plain unsafe. Keep arguing all you want but if the osha inspector (or your mother) saw it they'd be pissed.

OSHA,fdsej4v,t1_fds7ip3,1578700879.0,It's still an open flame surrounded by flammable materials. It's unsafe no matter how you look at it.
OSHA,fdse9t0,t1_fds8a3c,1578700699.0,"Irregardless, it still is retardedly unsafe. We are talking about an open flame next to flammable material. This tool wasn't designed to be a space heater what is wrong with you people."

AdviceAnimals,fdih10d,t1_fdi1trr,1578442723.0,"You're entirely missing the point. The problem isn't that people are posting pics of their kids, it's that they troll and fling shit at other people while hiding behind the facade of a cute pic of a child who has no idea they're being used in such a way."
AdviceAnimals,fdigk7c,t1_fdhucus,1578442417.0,"The idea is they can say whatever they want and get away with it because ""you can't attack a child."" It's extremely fucked up."
AdviceAnimals,fdigf69,t3_elf971,1578442329.0,That type of shit is straight up Machiavellian. They   think they can get away with whatever they want if they hide behind a child.

OldSchoolCool,fd6jnju,t1_fd6ikow,1578192057.0,How would that prove its authenticity? Also I find it interesting you aren't going to deny it.
OldSchoolCool,fd6id79,t3_ek5zpz,1578191493.0,"Yeah I call bullshit. Whys the graphic on his shirt blured out? Where is he anyway? A dark room on a submarine? To Scotland?? Why? Also the pic is too clear to be an old camera, definitely looks digital with a sepia filter."
facepalm,fd5r0g0,t1_fd24crp,1578180513.0,Exactly. And it's not like famous people come in to the restaurant every day. On the rare occasion that it does happen it definitely throws you through a loop.
