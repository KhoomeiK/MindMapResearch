We just leveled up to 4th, and I'm playing a Lore Bard Skill Monkey.  CHA is 18 with STR and WIS being odd.  The party is crammed full of casters, and I'm the fifth character.  (Barbarian, Eldritch Knight, Sorcerer, and Cleric / Wizard are the other players.) 

I've played a lot of D&D, this is my first 5e campaign.  Embarrassingly, I've got analysis paralysis on the feat or ASI to take.  

I've got it down to three choices. 

1. **Lucky** is a standout feat, of course.  

2. So is **+2 to Charisma** with all the extras to checks and the extra inspiration die, plus +1 to hit and save with all spells.  

3. **Magic Initiate Druid**: *Guidance* for what's essentially unlimited uses of Inspiration, maybe *Druidcraft* for flavor and camping, then move *Healing Word* to the druid list, and pick up a Bardier Bard spell for 1st level.  (Spell saves for Druid would be at +1 instead of +4, so they'd be utility choices.)  Could also do **Warlock** for EB and Minor Illusion, then find a good 1st level Warlock spell. 

If there's another feat that would be neat I'm open to suggestions -- I looked at Diplomat, Actor, Menacing, and they're all *good* but probably *less good* than these three.  I'm rarely in melee so Moderately Armored wouldn't help much.  Realistically, these would be my choices for ASI at 4th, 8th, and 12th level now that I think about it."

The skills will make enough of the in-game currency to keep your character going.  It will give you the ability to participate in almost any of the side activities, sometimes unlocking venues faster than dedicated professionals in the side activities.
