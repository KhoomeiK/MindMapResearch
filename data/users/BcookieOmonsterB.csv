All of those charges require knowledge of the investigation not mere assumption. 
Conspiracy to obstruct justice specifically requires two people with knowledge. 
Obstruction via 18 usc 1503 specifically requires knowledge and a connection. 
Rico doesn't apply at all, or at least not any more or less then it would effect you or I since it requires no specific intent or criminal intent or action.

Yes clearly that true, however that isn't how the law works knowledge is required, not mere assumption (the supreme court has routinely ruled that mere assumption has no legal bearing in criminal investigations). They literally have to prove the subject of the investigation **knew** not assumed, not thought but know by actual knowledge."

It's literally the same thing, it just means they have to go and apply for a new warrant which is the same thing for a removed gps unit. Though warrants aren't required for gps in most cases most places will still apply for it so as to leave a paper trail. Similarly of it is a warrantless gps use there's absolutely no recourse for the government even if stolen as they've left it in your possession and control with no legal basis to. Ie. Abandoning property. 

> They have proven you are using a phone already to a judge. If the person started using burners, etc, depending on the investigation it may just broaden the charges or create a whole new set.

Do you have any amount of case law to support that assertion because as far as I'm aware to interfere with an investigation it has to be knowingly interfering.
