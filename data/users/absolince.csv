It's very difficult to find even neurologists to have experience or answers. I've been taking gabapentin since the nineties when I was first diagnosed and it really is the only thing that has worked. Unfortunately I'm very sensitive to the withdrawal which for me is every few hours. I've had these symptoms but never did any Dr. understand the side effects of gabapentin because it was the new ""wonder"" drug and is still being repackaged now. I believe it's a very dangerous drug. So be careful with that although every one is different. That being said I continue to have to take gabapentin to get any sleep at all. I hope you don't have to suffer much longer and find a Dr. that can help. Take care."

""By the 1800s, Native Americans learned to use horses to chase bison, dramatically expanding their hunting range. But then white trappers and traders introduced guns in the West, killing millions more buffalo for their hides. By the middle of the 19th century, even train passengers were shooting bison for sport. ""Buffalo"" Bill Cody, who was hired to kill bison, slaughtered more than 4,000 bison in two years. Bison were a centerpiece of his Wild West Show, which was very successful both in the United States and in Europe, distilling the excitement of the West to those who had little contact with it.

To make matters worse for wild buffalo, some U.S. government officials actively destroyed bison to defeat their Native American enemies who resisted the takeover of their lands by white settlers. American military commanders ordered troops to kill buffalo to deny Native Americans an important source of food."""
