or maybe we're the host?

i can start to think of a kind of a new theory

everything was good then people went to the end for whatever reason and brought back a parasite, endermites. the endermites slowly transformed their hosts to have an affinity for 'ender' (idk, maybe void) so the transformed mostly went to the end. when you use an ender pearl (which harnesses 'ender') sometimes a endermite is attracted to the change in 'ender'"
