I’m not underweight, I have no hormonal issues, and everything else has been growing properly. There is nothing wrong with my body but I did not follow the path of the women on either side. 

I’m sorry for the harsh truth, but once you let go of that hope, you can come to terms with your own body instead of hoping for another. That hope will eat you up inside. Once you come to terms with your body and let go of a perfect image, you will feel much better."

Speed, no screen scratching due to bumpers, accessibility (of games og 3ds cant play), louder sound, tiny c-stick nub thing i have yet to use, better 3d, other stuff im probably missing. 

If the new 3ds xl looks good to you, I’d sell the og ones. You could probably get enough to pay for the new 3ds xl if you sell two used og 3ds (if you still have both). Then again you have multiple 3ds family devices. Do you really need another?"

Genetics (while they definitely apply) aren’t everything. Stuff like diet can influence growth (in general, not just in breasts), so you honestly never know.

Japanese systems are generally cheaper (watch out for shipping tho) so if you’re unsure of your skill, you can start there. O3DS is good but also 2DS is good too. But since 2DS refurbished is $50 you’d have to sell for cheaper... so you wouldn’t exactly make money in most cases (such as screen repair, which is a whopping $20).

Oh, and fishing is much better. No minigame? Yes please. Also, the music is beautiful. I discover games by their soundtracks because i study to them... the whole one song one hour thing? Yes, I’m for it.  Yes please. Even the monotone singing of K.K. Slider is somehow amazing. 

The game is designed around being a daily play sort of thing and the design in that aspect is genius. 

So far ACNL is the only game on my N3DSXL and I’ve played it without getting bored for a straight four months. I’m terrified of losing that magic that is pure addiction so I’m looking into getting other games haha. Even though I haven’t touched the surface it seems.

If the inner screws are rusty there might be liquid damage. There’s a sticker on the motherboard that should be white w spots; if it’s pink, there’s been liquid damage. Use your isopropyl to clean the contacts of the buttons. Gently peel back the clear tape and take out the four metal shells. The contacts should all be shiny.
