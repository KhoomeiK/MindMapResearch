Wellthatsucks,fe2y40w,t1_fe2matk,1578844122.0,"Fun fact. Official Scrabble is played with whatever word list the players (or organizers, in the case of a tournament) agree upon before play starts. There are three common word lists:

The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary: This is the OSPD, and, as its name implies, it is, in fact, a dictionary, and includes definitions. Currently in its sixth edition. It is published by Merriam-Webster, a lexicographic company. It is the primary source of official Scrabble word lists and every time a new edition comes out, all other word lists are updated. In order to be somewhat family-friendly, most offensive words in the English language are omitted from the OSPD. It contains words from 2-8 letters in length.

The NASPA (North American Scrabble Players Association) Word List: Known as the ""OWL"" list among fans. Currently in its fourth edition (OWL4). It is the list most commonly used in U.S., Canada, and Thai tournaments (why Thai? I'm not sure). It is *primarily* the OSPD, plus the redacted offensive words, and additional words in the 9-15 letter length range.

The Collins Scrabble Words List: Formerly known as ""SOWPODS"" for geeky Scrabble reasons. Now in its 19th revision (CSW19). This is the word list used in tournaments outside of the three countries above. Primarily, this is the NASPA word list, plus a bunch of British-accepted spelling variations (such as colour or favourite). This list is also published without definitions.

So... you can ""officially"" sit down and play Scrabble with whatever word list you like, as long as everyone agrees before you start play. However, if by ""official"" you mean sanctioned by an organization - I think you're kind of splitting hairs. The OSPD6 is absolutely what it says on the cover. It *is* the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, and it contains definitions. There's a reason that OWL and CSW update when OSPD does."

3Dprinting,fdx1o2c,t1_fdx1e3q,1578764387.0,I would like to emphasize again that I like it a lot! I’m just picky about the functionality of coasters.
survivor,fdx08l8,t1_fdwzxra,1578764008.0,Trying to stomp it out. This is an excellent example of a case where it doesn’t belong.
3Dprinting,fdwv66k,t1_fduzz2e,1578762632.0,"So... I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but I'm kind of picky about coasters. So let me tell you about how I think this is an incomplete (admitted by OP, it needs sanding and polishing) but beautiful piece of craftsmanship, but it will, in fact, be a *terrible* coaster. I say this because coasters aren't just random gewgaws that litter up a coffee table - they're tools. They are there so that one can rest their drinks on a surface that might otherwise be damaged by the presence of said drinks. Drinks of various kinds offer two hazards to a table's surface: high temperatures and moisture.

High temperatures: Tea, coffee, cocoa, mate, or what have you. Whatever your hot beverage of choice is, a hot mug on the wrong surface can really cause damage to your table. In order to avoid this, you need a coaster! The coaster should be insulative enough that it won't just transfer the heat through to the surface (this really doesn't take much, but I've seen some coasters that wouldn't cut it). Also and importantly, the coaster itself must be able to withstand the high temperature of the mug (or teacup or whatever). While there are some resins that could handle this, I do believe they are more specialized. I fear that with a fresh cup of very hot coffee placed on this coaster, it would be damaged and that would be sad because it's very pretty.

Moisture: Whether it be from condensation or dribbling or otherwise mildly spilling your drink, some table surfaces can be damaged by moisture. A coaster needs to be able to protect your table from that. To that end, it needs to be able to capture the water coming off of the beverage container. That capture can come in the form of absorption (as seen with some leather or cardboard coasters) or in the form of a raised support structure that holds the cup above a lower surface of the coaster (such as a raised series of pegs or a grate-like structure) - either way, it almost certainly needs a lip around the outside. Having a coaster that is completely flat and made of water-impermeable substances without a lip is just silly. The water will run down your cup, across your coaster, and onto your table.

A good coaster has one final requirement - Ideally, it needs to not stick to your cup through suction or adhesion. This is a common flaw of coasters that are too flat with no texture and/or are too light and soft (a problem with cardboard coasters that almost everyone has experienced). Largely this is achieved by minimizing the surface area contact between the cup and the coaster through raised texture and choosing a material that is unlikely to easily adhere to plastic, glass, or ceramic. After being sanded and polished, I believe OP's work, used as a coaster, would stick to any wet cup like crazy.

So... I really really like OP's piece. I like the idea and I might steal it for some of my own work in the future. We don't even know whether or not he/she intends it to be a coaster. However, if that is the intention, I would encourage OP to never use it with hot beverages, and to find some way to put a lip on it."

It wasn't controversial for its violence. Not when it came out. It was an R-rated action movie. That's expected to have a lot of shooting and such. Now... Three weeks *after* it came out, it became controversial because of the Columbine shooting. Those dipshits wore trench coats and shot up a school. Neo wore a trench coat and shot a lot of guns, so people made a causative connection there. Those losers owned and wore trench coats before The Matrix came out. Columbine was controversial (rightly so) and The Matrix was the most recent gun-filled action movie to come out. It was a victim of circumstance.

It didn't ""literally create new world views."" The whole idea of a simulated reality and the fact that reality is far greater than what you perceive goes way, way back. Most famously described early on by Plato in his [allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave) from his work *Republic.* That was written about 2,400 years ago.

A guy from the Sales team comes over and asks us what we're doing. It rarely pays to piss off the guys in Sales, so we gave him a brief rundown on the problem.

So, he kinda hesitates and looks at us all and says, ""Well, I don't want to speak out of turn, but couldn't you use Tool X with Option Y?"" (The specifics would get off in the weeds real quick.)

\- Maybe the company would do even better if I weren't goofing around all day (but also maybe not... depends on the job).

However, there are *definitely* a lot of jobs where there is 8 (or more) hours of work to do every day (manufacturing, warehousing, driving, etc.).

I quite like mayo as a condiment and an ingredient (I honestly haven't ever tried it in guac, but I've seen the recipes). Unfortunately... it's whipped oil, which means it's one of those things that one needs to use in moderation."

And they're not some weirdo frankenstein New Hampshire we-have-no-idea-what-we're-doing recipes... they're authentic-from-Mexico recipes. Sometimes they're served hot, too."

Take the relic to a specific location or series of locations. It's an intelligent book. Maybe it wants to visit a hard-to-reach library - see some old friends.  
Maybe it needs some very special ink. I imagine a scenario where the book's new print starts to get weak as it communicates that it's very thirsty (think like a printer running out of toner). Then later it drinks a physically impossible volume of some very difficult to manufacture pigment.  
Maybe it wants to feel prettier. Hey, it's a very special intelligent book. Who says it can't be vain? Take it to a legendary book binder who is some combination of far away and hard to access (works in a monastery in the mountains or in a king's palace where the PCs aren't allowed to go).
