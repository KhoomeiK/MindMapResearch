AmItheAsshole,fdm5vju,t3_eluqog,1578540547.0,"NTA.  Your SIL was aware of her boyfriend's problem, she should have mentioned this to you.  I'm assuming she knew about the C section as well . . . So she knew your wife had had a pretty significant surgery a few months ago and it didn't occur to her that she might have been prescribed narcotics, and that maybe she should say something before bringing her addict BF over? 

Besides, you said the pills were put away in a medicine cabinet.  Which means her boyfriend went through your medicine cabinet.  Which means he went into your bathroom already thinking about checking it for drugs.  It's not your fault at all. 

If your SIL had said something beforehand I'd feel differently."

TwoXChromosomes,fcuptu7,t3_eirnp9,1577986081.0,"OP, first of all, don't be embarrassed or ashamed.  You're allowed to send nudes.  Your boyfriend violated your trust and privacy by sharing them with his dad.  HE should be embarrassed and ashamed and disgusted with himself. 

Also, as far as him recognizing this as an issue and being able to change--that might be true.  But he's established that his father is allowed to see your pictures, and it's going to be very difficult for him to reset that boundary with his dad.  That could create issues between them and possibly between you and your boyfriend, who knows.  Just pointing this out. 

Regardless of whether you guys get back together (which you shouldn't, no contact is definitely the right move here) make sure he's deleted your nudes from his phone.  If you do get back together don't send him nudes, ever again, and go no contact with his dad."

Mom wants to definitively blame someone because she feels guilty, as she should--even in 1994 what kind of parent wouldn't at least have called the house where the sleepover was happening to make sure their kids were there?  And I don't put any weight in her photo ID; she was so eager to see her son she would have said it was him no matter what picture she was shown. 

Realistically, since Kim was found killed and in the water, I think it's most likely that her brother met the same fate and his body never surfaced.  Probably a crime of opportunity since these were 2 young children alone.  If a pedo ring was behind it, why would Kim have been killed?  Surely the goal would've been to take both kids alive."

Maybe her siblings were involved.  I didn't see their ages mentioned anywhere, but maybe they were riled up from jet lag and adrenaline and decided to sneak out and see the jungle at night.  Nora wakes up too and wants to come so they help her out the window and head off; at some point she falls behind and the it siblings press on, assuming she'll catch up.  But they lose track of her, maybe search for a bit, then go back to the resort and go to sleep.  They don't say anything to avoid getting in trouble, let their mom report her missing, and assume that with the big search effort she'll be found quickly. 

As far as where she was found, if it was so inaccessible how was it able to be searched multiple times?  And why search it to begin with if she had mobility issues unless it was assumed that her or a kidnapper could access that area?  I'm just saying that based on all this,that spot isn't as inaccessible as news sources would have us believe."
