I do take some solace in the fact that their career is in the gutter. There's no way they *walked away* from flippin' Star Wars to focus on their Netflix series. Though, it does sting that GoT was cut short so they could move on to Star Wars, which they didn't even do... dang it, I got myself mad again."
SandersForPresident,fgvhqgo,t1_fgve94o,1581149148.0,"It's getting a bit late here, so my tired answer is, eh, whatever, Pete's campaign isn't going to last much longer, just wait it out. :p 

My actual answer re: billionaires would be to try to communicate to them the sheer *scope* of a billion dollars. If you earned $1,000 a day, after living expenses, every day, with no holidays, it would take you over 2,700 years to *just* enter the billionaire class. Heck, if you started today at a cushy job that paid you $10,000 per day, you could finally become a billionaire just near the end of 2293. And there are people with *tens* of billions of dollars.

So... why do they have billions of dollars in their lifetimes? It's *absurd* to think that one person can do enough actual work that the fair pay for it would make them a millionaire. I mean, the average household net worth in the US is under $100,000. (Double check this, I just did a cursory search Still, there's no reasonable number that makes billionaires not *obscenely* wealthy by comparison.) Let's be *generous* and say an individual is worth that much, just to get this into the right *order of magnitude*. Are billionaires some special class of people that's worth as much to society as 10,000 normal people? Ten *thousand*?

What do they have to offer? If it's not the work they do, are they that much smarter? You don't see many surgeons become billionaires, or college professors, or astrophysicists. Heck, you see very few if *any* billionaires who didn't come from wealthy families to begin with. Weird, huh?

You don't *earn* a billion dollars, you get it from exploiting people. You leverage the capital you already have, pay workers less than the value they generate, and pocket the rest. I mean, no doubt Jeff Bezos does work at Amazon, but does he really produce enough value single-handedly to be worth billions? He's not putting things in boxes, he's not delivering packages, he's not working on the Prime Video software or managing all the content licenses.

Every billionaire is a policy failure, and they're not going to donate to someone who wants to fix the things they exploited to get where they are.

And Pete is being slimy with the question. He's portraying his acceptance of donations as something between a necessary evil and *a good thing, actually* in order to beat Trump... but he's not waiting on spending that money. He's doing that now, in the primaries, and billionaires gave him that money not to take on Trump, but to take on people like Sanders, who actually pose a thread to their repulsive level of wealth. If Pete gets the nomination, billionaires can stop caring, because they'll be fine either way. Sure, they'll pay a bit more in taxes, but at least  they won't have to pay thousands upon thousands of their workers a living wage, or have to contend with unions demanding safe working conditions, or a marginal tax rate that might make them mere multi-millionaires in a few years.

I might also bring up that while straight capitalism might be efficient at *producing* wealth, it is incredibly *inefficient* at distributing that wealth. Studies have shown that wealth can buy happiness, but only up to a point—actually around $75,000 per year. It covers basic needs, it covers some luxuries, and it covers pursuits beyond just working to survive and sustain your family. The average income in the US is $56,000, and of course there are many people living below the poverty line. If they work wage jobs, then their bosses are siphoning some of the value they produce for the company. In terms of human happiness, it seems wrong to siphon money from someone who needs it to someone who is *obsessed* with it but doesn't particularly need it, no?

And look into Elon Musk, because holy shit you're going to have a rough time if they're fanboys of his. He's cultivated this mythology about himself, that he's a self-made multi-billionaire, and a real-life Tony Stark. In reality, he came from a wealthy South African family (like, bought-half-an-emerald-mine-on-a-lark wealthy), so he had startup capital to be an early mover on the internet. He exploits his workers, including hostile and downright *dangerous* working conditions. He intimidates them out of unionizing. And, like all billionaires, it's not like he's up all night poring over schematics, welding panels onto the Falcon-X, and kissing each and every Tesla on the bonnet before shipping it out.

Alright, so I'm tired, and it turns out the corner I cut was *editing*. Sorry about that. :p I hope it still helps, and if not, I may revisit it later. Also, look up some videos on ""BreadTube,"" or leftist YouTube. A couple places to start:

Even if you or your friends aren't so far as anti-capitalist (like me, hi!), there are certain issues inherent to capitalism that have to be addressed or we'll slide straight back into the early days of the industrial revolution."

cocktails,fgv7nl7,t1_fgv6x7s,1581139621.0,"Happy to help!

Also, I did some more research on my own, and I've seen a ""Violet Fizz"" in a few places, which is essentially a Ramos Gin Fizz but with creme de violette to give it a floral note instead of (or in addition to?) orange flower water. [Here's one from this sub just a few days ago!](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/eyvpeu/a_violet_fizz/)

Between that and looking at the recipes above, I think there are a couple of takeaways:

1. It goes well with gin, lemon/lime, and a sweetener; pretty much anything that has a gin sour or gimlet as a base to build off on may be worth experimenting with. (I'm curious to try how it would work with rum, too.)

2. There are some recipes that use orange flower water, and if the goal is to give the cocktail a floral note, creme de violette could be a natural substitution to riff on that cocktail.

Naturally, between the two, the Violet Fizz was inevitable and delicious.

cocktails,fgux8xg,t1_fguvhe8,1581131492.0,"I wish I could tell you, but all I know is that it tastes nice and works well in cocktails. I haven't had another cocktail to do a side-by-side comparison. I should have been clearer when I wrote my comment, but I meant that, when looking for an absinthe, I got it because it was a good combination of cost, availability, and good reviews, and have been happy with it, not that I've tried several and landed on this one.

You might also find [this video](https://youtu.be/n8Dzvf9Aum4?t=869) helpful. It's from How to Drink (which is a great channel anyway) about absinthe, and I timestamped it to the St. George part.

You *might* also want to consider Herbsaint, which was the go-to absinthe substitute when absinthe was banned in the US. I also don't have experience with that, but (again from reviews I've read) it might be better to go with a good, fake absinthe than a bad, arguably ""real"" absinthe."
cocktails,fguugj0,t1_fgutd30,1581129686.0,"I second it. It's good stuff, and at least where I am, it was the most affordable absinthe. (""Affordable absinthe"" being a relative term; it still stung the wallet. :p) Plus it gets recommended fairly frequently.

Plus, as others have said, if you're using it mostly in cocktails as an enhancer, a bottle will last you a looong time. It's a lot like bitters in that way, and coincidentally, kind of in the same ballpark when it comes to price, if you were to look at it in terms of price per volume. You just don't usually see 750ml bottles of Ango. :p

wholesomememes,fgumwji,t1_fgul54g,1581124733.0,"No need to apologize! I think this is a refreshingly civil discussion. :)

I mentioned this elsewhere, but I do support UBI, especially as the economy has to transform into something sustainable. I'm convinced about the benefits you mentioned. I think we just differ in *where* it is as a priority—and all due credit to Yang for bringing it up in the first place, at least at such a high level in political debates.

Honestly, I'm really not trying to convince Yang supporters, because, out of the rest of the field, I don't want them to flip at this stage of the primary. I'm rooting for Bernie and it looks like he has a strong lead at this stage, but like I said earlier, I like having Yang in the debates, and even if he doesn't win this thing, the work Yang supporters are doing isn't going to evaporate. It's shaping the discussion, and cementing Yang as a person to take seriously moving forward.

So, for instance, Bernie lost the primary in 2016, but he managed to push the DNC platform, fix some parts of the (disastrously) broken primary system, and inspire a ton of new voices to run for office. Now, in 2020, he entered the race with a LOT more momentum.

wholesomememes,fgueo0k,t1_fguc0om,1581118953.0,"I mean, sure, I'm always for a bottom-up approach to economic stimulus. Still, it doesn't really address my problems with a good chunk of the freedom dividend inevitably being eaten up by landlords, who I wouldn't put in the same category as *good* small business owners. They are definitely more on the side of sucking up and hoarding wealth, especially since property in many places in America is out of reach for most residents to own outright.

I guess my general issue is that, while the Freedom Dividend is still a good thing, it's not the cure-all that it sometimes is depicted as, especially if it's going to come at the cost of targeted solutions to specific problems. I'd prefer things like Medicare For All, and directly confronting the housing crisis, and community-owned utilities (including internet) before UBI.

Though I *do* support UBI, and part of why I want Yang in the debates even if he's not my preferred candidate is that, when he's on stage, UBI is up for discussion. I just have some issues with his plan that keep me from supporting Yang to the same extent I support Bernie."

wholesomememes,fgu5mm5,t1_fgtygu9,1581113740.0,"Not the person you asked, but I have some bones to pick with his particular implementation of UBI.

First is that, without certain necessities being socialized, like medicine (and Yang isn't for single-payer), housing, utilities, etc., a good chunk of that money is just going to go straight to the people who own land and necessity goods and services. It may not be widespread inflation, but it will mean landlords know they can squeeze you for more than they used to.

Second is, and I welcome being corrected since I can't find it on his policy page, but his version of UBI would come at the cost of other forms of aid. If people have to choose between, say, food stamps *or* the freedom dividend, then UBI is a no-strings-attached $1,000 per month to all Americans... except the poorest ones who need it the most.

Third is that it only applies to adults, which leaves families with children at, effectively, a disadvantage. Granted, this is probably the least of my issues, since there may still be tax benefits to alleviate financial burdens on families with children. Still, I'd prefer a freedom *stipend* to take care of kids, or to bundle it with better socialized services for childcare, improve public schools, etc.

And I should mention, I like that my issues with Yang are about *implementation*. That's the kind of thing that can be worked out together, especially since I have faith Yang would consult with experts to work things out, or to refine his policies over time. :) Basically, I'm going to keep an eye on him going forward, so no matter how he does in the primary, I hope it solidifies him as a candidate for future elections."

1. Laziness. Why have a robust understanding of an issue when you can just *pretend* to have nuance? You can look unbiased, free-thinking, and sophisticated, when in reality, you just couldn't be bothered to look into an issue and get to the truth, but you want to *look* like you did.

2. ""Hiding your power level."" Pretty self-explanatory. People either lying to others or themselves about their own right-wing views.

Democrats are worried about it because of indications of election interference, election fraud, and the president *on multiple occasions* praising dictators and saying he wants to try ending term limits.

Republicans said the same kind of stuff during the Obama administration, though! ...for no particular reason.

But both sides said it, so they must both be equal.

Same goes with ""obstruction."" Republicans will filibuster their own bills if Democrats agree with it, and will stall appointments up to and including a Supreme Court seat.

SandersForPresident,fgmsy2t,t1_fgmcfpp,1580931412.0,"And the complete lack of self-awareness. I genuinely wonder how someone can *repeatedly* make vague, baseless accusations about how Bernie and his supporters are bigots, liars, toxic, mean, trolls... and not think, ""Oh, wait, I'm being a huge hypocrite."""
SandersForPresident,fgmssm9,t1_fgmhe6v,1580931323.0,"It's so weird to see it as someone who *isn't* vegetarian, but has a bunch of friends including pescatarians, vegetarians, and vegans. You know how often their diet comes up? *When we're talking about food*. That's it. Just when it's relevant, like picking a restaurant to eat at, or talking about recipes we made recently, or if I'm planning to have people over and want to make sure there's something for everybody.

I'm sure there are obnoxious vegetarians, but they are absolutely dwarfed by dickhead anti-vegetarians who just want an excuse to be an ass."

If you used them a lot, you would level up, and if you leveled up, literally the entire game got *harder*.

If you focused on skills you *didn't* specialize in, those skills would improve without you leveling up, giving you the only sense of character improvement relative to the world in the entire game.

Not only was this grindy, it led to completely unintuitive character creation, where the optimal build is to not focus on any skills you want to actually use."
SandersForPresident,fgl3swh,t1_fgl3kk5,1580881117.0,"Exactly. Honestly, this is better than losing to Biden, and might even be better than a narrow victory with Biden in second place. Taking him out of the running is HUGE.
