Eminem,fexhpek,t1_fewvdga,1579431179.0,"For some reason, I smell a Homestuck reference in this comment.

If it was, nice reference, my dude."

I also have some RP chumhandles, a couple in fact. But, unless you want the full list (as of now). I will not post the list of RP chumhandles I have here."

facepalm,fca3shd,t1_fca2ejx,1577562667.0,"1. Well...you did say ""Wrong reddit? Don't you mean subreddit?"", which yes, you were sorta correcting me there, chief.

3. I actually meant subreddit and not Reddit. And Contradicting instead of contracting."
facepalm,fca20h2,t1_fca14ve,1577561839.0,"I just typed too fast (just like most of the time), no need to point that out.

And why? Why else would he post it there?"
