dogs,ff3ghzq,t1_ff3f4l8,1579540556.0,"It was more a comment on the name becoming common in my area despite only one person vocally breeding and his dogs not going by that name and not many going on to be pets. Clearly something else is happening as well, probably a few of his dogs failing out (normal) and back yard breeders producing more. Since this is what I'm seeing in my area, it doesn't seem unlikely to be happening elsewhere, further supporting the likelihood that this isn't a random mutation or a less common retriever breed, but a mix of two very common breeds and possibly purposefully.

Edit: so just supporting your anecdote with one of my own!"
dogs,ff39v02,t1_ff31ft4,1579537073.0,"Agreed - it's very likely to be a lab/golden mix and, if not,  almost certainly a mix of some other kind. Black lab/ golden mixes are becoming more popular in my area, though, with the black golden name being used. There's a vet that's breeding them around here after he accidentally bred a litter and fell in love with the resulting pups (although he does not use the fanciful name and apparently most are placed with a service dog organization ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) so it could be a VERY regional thing."
dogs,ff38kw5,t3_eretox,1579536246.0,"Food pantries sometimes have dog food available. You could also call your local shelter/humane society - they may run programs to provide temporary assistance with food/ supplies or they may be aware of organizations that do and refer you to them. You could also try checking Facebook marketplace or craigslist to see if anyone is getting rid of unwanted food (I've had friends do this after their dog passed away and the organizations around couldn't accept open bags). You'll probably get judged/harassed a bit, but if you post on your neighborhood's Facebook or nextdoor, you'll likely get some donated food. 

The above are all temporary measures. If you know your situation isn't going to change soon or you find yourself in this position multiple times, you need to seriously consider what options might be best for the dog."
dogs,fdrmhjv,t3_emuh20,1578686609.0,"Block off access to the window,  including closing any blinds or curtains for a bit and try to distract him when or (if at all possible)  right before he turns to try to get to the window. Keep him leashed inside so you can lead him away. It might also help to crate train him so he's not just constantly looking for distractions when he should be sleeping. 

Enforced napping really helped my puppy when he just couldn't seem to recognize that he was tired and that he wouldn't miss out on fun things if he went to sleep. It sounds a different from what you're going through, but I see enough cross-over that I think it might be worth considering."
dogs,fdo9le4,t1_fdo79kp,1578601257.0,Thanks! That at least gives me something to keep an eye out for in reviews.
dogs,fdnsi5j,t1_fdnkpld,1578591943.0,"Do you like the cavalettis you have? If so, do you mind sharing what brand they are? I've been wanting to get a set for Duke, but they aren't available to me locally and all the ones I've seen online look so light and flimsy - I'm afraid I'll spend $60 for a light breeze to carry them away or my Freight train of a puppy mangling them the first time he inevitably runs into them on accident."
dogs,fdci2ud,t3_ekmd98,1578275439.0,"If the dog is running, it could increase the risk of injury especially if it's an uncoordinated puppy or the dog's hair in between its paw pads hasn't been trimmed (just like it would for a person wearing socks) and some dogs do just generally have a harder time not slipping, but it's typically nothing that area rugs wouldn't fix. 

If you are super concerned, you could plan on paying extra attention to (safely) conditioning the dog to ensure maintenance of good core strength  and even strength in front legs and back legs. Obviously this is always a good thing to do anyway (but also very easy to forget in the face of a new dog).

Edit: here's a link to a vet street article about training your dog to walk on smooth surfaces.  [Article ](http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/training-your-dog-to-walk-on-slippery-floors)"
dogs,fd6bkz3,t3_ek5w38,1578188475.0,"You could also look at purchasing it elsewhere. I just checked Chewy and it looks like they sell packs of 6 for $110 - so if you bought two, it'd be ~$40 cheaper than your vet and qualifies for free shipping. Not a whole lot in savings, but something to keep in mind if you can't find something else you like."
dogs,fd67fo4,t3_ek4ztv,1578186630.0,"I would suggest looking for an organization that places all their dogs in foster homes and rather than applying for a specific dog right away, contact the organization and let them know what you're looking for and ask if they keep lists and will call if they get a dog in that seems like a good fit if they don't have one already. This might be very location driven - if you're in an area where they truck in dogs from all over and still can't keep up with demand or if they're a municipal shelter they may not allow this. Where I am, the local humane society does this and dogs that get adopted this way do spend time at a foster home but are never publically listed (most of their small dogs are adopted this way since there is so much demand and so little supply). 

Even if they don't do that, having all dogs in foster homes means they get a better idea about the dog's personality and behavior. 

You could also reach out to breeders and let them know you're looking for an older, known dog. Many of them rehome dogs that return to them if the previous owner moved overseas or passed away, etc. or occasionally when they retire a dog from their program; however, you should probably expect a pretty long wait for a dog to become available with this method."
dogs,fd644xf,t3_ek3sar,1578185269.0,"I think the points others have made about training and behavior are right. 

So I'm going to answer a question you didn't ask and say that while I love dogs of all sizes, I can't see myself owning a small dog because I'm not good enough at training. Small dogs' mouths are just so far from my hand and my treat timing is already shit, plus the temptation to do things like just physically move the dog instead of training consistently would be much higher than it is for a dog that is/will be heavy... I'm not sure I trust myself to not get flustered or impatient and give in to that temptation too often, which wouldn't be fair to the dog or to my future self."
dogs,fd5zhjo,t1_fd3anww,1578183465.0,New Year's resolutions might explain the higher number of dogs. I'm still working with Duke on his frustrated greeter reactivity so I've actually been avoiding regular neighborhood walks lately because of the extra dogs out and about when I wouldn't normally expect many.  I'm not sure whether to hope things get back to normal soon or to hope that this becomes the new normal. Duke is normally one of four dogs that ever gets walked on my block and almost every house has at least one dog (many of whom hang out 24/7 in backyards unfortunately - and we all have small suburban size lots so it's not like they've got acres to roam).
dogs,fd5xgrd,t1_fd56cos,1578182730.0,"My pup does that as well for any kind of toy attached to a cord of any kind, but it's definitely because he's trying to break the cord. His success rate is very high and so I no longer buy them... at least not until I 1. figure out a way to train him out of it and 2. I get through our more important behavior/training goals."
bulletjournal,fcpauuq,t3_ei7bq4,1577856539.0,"Lots of great books on this list and a very cool idea to keep track! I do recommend that you consider subbing some out for other deserving titles (there are tons of these lists) if you find you just aren't enjoying one. For example, I would never subject myself to Moby Dick again and wouldn't have bothered finishing the first time if it hadn't been for a class."
dogs,fclfce6,t3_eho07v,1577746489.0,"So I don't have depression but I do have ADHD which has some of the issues with executive functioning depression can cause and I have hypothyroidism which causes fatigue when not well managed (very easy to manage, a pill a day, and yet I am bad at managing it so I'm often symptomatic) and having a dog is actively helpful for me to the point where I would almost consider him to be a coping mechanism. For example, it's easier to keep my house clean because I need it to be safe for him so my brain helpfully ""sees"" the problems in a timely fashion (I guess because now it's immediately important?) whereas when I'm living alone I'm both blind to the mess longer (literally I either do not notice or notice and get distracted too quickly then forget) and I have trouble getting started when I do notice - thinking my dog might get hurt or ill by eating something gives me enough external motivation to push through the inertia. 

HOWEVER, if I didn't have other coping mechanisms in place (medication, certain organizational practices, practiced self-awarenesss/self-reflection, a support system including a really good relationship with my doctor, etc.) in place, I could easily see it going badly for both of us. So... highly situational."
mildlyinteresting,fcj05fp,t3_ehf7y2,1577673996.0,"Maybe it was an attempt to make the room look/feel larger than it is? Pretty odd, though."
dogs,fbt6lfw,t3_eeaq9x,1577069686.0,"Like a lot of others who have commented, my local independent pet stores are more expensive, very aggressive about crazy anti-vax/anti-grain for every dog/alpha theory junk, and carry only very standard basic toys, collars and leashes. Why would I pay three times as much to buy cheap shit to some asshole berating me for being a responsible dog owner? There is one (of 3) that's not quite that bad, but the store shelving is extremely narrow and crowded (they don't allow pets inside and I'm pretty sure it's not wheelchair accessible) and the cashier has basically acted like my very existence in the store is bothersome each time I attempted to shop and again, all standard uninteresting merchandise so... not worth it even though I do try to shop small and local for other types of goods. 

I have gone to some cute little boutiques while in larger cities and enjoyed it very much even though it was expensive - but the key was the nice atmosphere and unique goods (compared to Petsmart/petco, easily sourced online,  admittedly but nice to see in person before purchasing)."
