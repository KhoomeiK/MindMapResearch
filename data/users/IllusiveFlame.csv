TheSilphRoad,ffpts4l,t3_eubjbv,1580105417.0,Anybody gonna talk about the glitches with raids where you lose the first 10 seconds and last 3? I've barely lost too many raids from it. Obviously stoped spending on the game a long time ago
TheSilphRoad,ffptls8,t1_ffoxqyo,1580105230.0,I'm sorry but what is this about premium passes for PVP? Are you guys saying they're going to give the option to  pay to some kind of weird thing that just boosts your rewards from PVPing? Or are they doing something like raid passes with it where you get one free battle a day and have to pay to keep fighting?
gaming,ffkxflh,t1_ffktlds,1580030726.0,"The easiest way I can explain them is you start with the deck, number-side up in 8 columns. You have 4 ""Free Cells"" and 4 cells to the side like you would in normal Solitaire (which you build from Ace to King to win the same way). You can move cards to and from the ""free cells"" at any point (only one per cell at a time though), and the cards in the columns get moved around in more or less the same way as in normal Solitaire (except you can only really move 1 card at a time). What I mean by that is, in order to move-say a stack of 3 cards from one column onto another-you would need free spaces for at least 2 of those cards to go.

Meaning if you have one column ending with a Black7, and want to move a stack of Red6,Black5, and Red4 to it, you would need to have at least 2 free cells free, to temporarily hold the cards in the stack.

Alternatively, if you manage to clear a column of cards fully, it more or less becomes an extra free cell that you get to build cards off of. Like how you build stacks from Kings in Solitaire, but these stacks can be started with any card. This part of the ruling can get kind of hard to explain without visuals or a computer to just do it for you, but having free columns gives you a lot more space to move cards around.

So, lets say you have 1 open column and all 4 free cells open. One of your columns has a Red(R) Jack on it, and another has a sequence from Black(B) 10 to R3.

You would basically move the 3,4,5,6 to the freecells, then the 7 to the open column, then move the 6,5,4, and 3 back to the 7 (most computers will let you just click the column and choose ""move stack"" or something like that to do this). Doing that opens the cells for the 8 and 9, which then lets you move the 10 over to the Jack and eventually bring the rest of the cards onto it. I know what I just said will make the game sound fucking excruciating, but I needed to explain the way the game uses its math to figure out how many cards you can move. Normally, you would basically just click the 10 and then the Jack (or drag the cards depending on the game), and it will pretty much do all of that bullshit for you (assuming you have enough space to do it)"
gaming,ffkv1a3,t1_ffjuuyl,1580029452.0,"Fun story about that. I had no fucking idea how to play it when I was a kid so I pretty much ignored it (like Hearts which I still don't understand). Had fun just kinda clicking random cards in Hearts to see what would happen like in Minesweeper. Well one day my aunt taught me how to play freecell with a little handheld game of it she had one night when I slept over. Ended up getting hooked on it and still play it randomly. Managed to get the original game off an old WinXP computer and honestly play it for like an hour a week, despite having a gaming pc with a massive backlog and internet access.

One brother took over almost every cabinet immediately, leaving us to split one. I just gave up and store most of my dry food in my room.

Only thing that sparks joy currently is how cheap rent is because of this, but even still, me and the brother splitting cabinet space are paying 50% more than the asshole one because he at first was going grocery shopping etc (which he doesn't now).

Yeah it's only supereffective against Grass, Bug (Fire is better esp. with community day starters), and Fighting (Lot of insane Psychic types with Espeon and Alakazam being pretty easy to get for a starterpack, ignoring Fairy with Gardevoir who was easy to get after it's community day and Mewtwo who is just generally insane lol).

TheSilphArena,feuax94,t1_fet5oz1,1579384854.0,"PVPoke honestly has saved me so much with this kinda stuff lol. But I don't think I have better ML mons tbh. We mostly have the same mons, with the only ones I have that they don't being Smacktar and Darkrai. They have Melmetal (which i don't) and (though probably not maxed like mine) Togekiss.

Adding to that, I am definitely more hardcore in Pokemon Go than them, but that's mainly because they're both busy with SW/SH. The main reason I've always failed against them is they've played nearly every Pokemon game ever made, while I barely got halfway through two other mainline games. And one of them watches a lot of youtube videos about competitive pvp in the main-series, while both have had type effectiveness memorized before they even got me into Go.

&#x200B;

Picking a team of just 3 mons seems so strange to me too. Like I want to have hard counters to what I remember them having as their top choices, but I also want to use some just generally top picks as well. Do you think Garchomp would work better than Swampert if their main focus is to take out Steel types like Melmetal or Metagross? I know Swampert is only weak to Grass, while Garchomp is to Dragon, Fairy and Ice but Swampert just seems much more big in terms of raw stats. Like PVPoke shows Swampert to lose to Tyranitar and just barely win against Melmetal, while walling Metagross; while Garchomp barely beats Metagross and Tyranitar, while walling Melmetal (all are assumed as openers).

&#x200B;

The whole combination of matchups varying based on amounts of shields and having to think about like 10 potential types that do well in ML is starting to make this a pain"

TheSilphArena,fekuw4j,t1_feku1p7,1579208092.0,I think I'm oddly enough going for Superpower/Outrage tbh. Superpower to counter another Snorlax and Outrage to be a safe swap from Swampert if they open with DNite
TheSilphArena,fekoc45,t1_fekn33p,1579204224.0,Ok definitely leaning towards Snorlax now. Sorry I kept forgetting you(?) mentioned Kyogre losing to Melmetal/Dragonite (there's a lot of people talking about pros and cons about different Pokemon lol)
TheSilphArena,feko33u,t1_fekn32w,1579204077.0,"Ok yeah I'm pretty much guaranteed to use Swampert and Togekiss now. Been mainly trying to figure out a good safe swap/generalist or other really good high tier Pokemon to fill the third slot. Machamp and Kyogre have been mentioned as having hard matchups though against Dragonite and Melmetal (making Snorlax seem to be among the best options if I can pick a good set of charges). I can only see Machamp coming in on a Snorlax or Tyranitar tbh

TheSilphArena,fekmvk8,t1_fekm3he,1579203354.0,"True, any ideas for a better generalist/safe swap then? Kyogre seems like a good option for just neutral damage at this point. But I probably won't say no to using a Metagross or other legendary tbh"

TheSilphArena,fekklh8,t1_fekjqlg,1579202001.0,"Ok cool thanks for the help. Definitely using Swampert, Togekiss and almost definitely Snorlax now. Togekiss' moveset will probably be what it gets when I evolve it (hopefully won't get DG)"
TheSilphArena,fekjcl6,t1_fekiwcg,1579201254.0,Awesome I appreciate the info! I'm the only one of the three of us with a Darkrai so I'm not worried about that. Guess Snorlax would just be more or less a war of attrition if they pull one out
TheSilphArena,fekj3rm,t1_fekivgb,1579201108.0,Ok fair point. Would it still be worth keeping DG for raids though? If the Togepi gets Flamethrower+Ancient Power when I evolve it I'll keep those but would prefer to save TMs if it gets DG
TheSilphArena,fekhytz,t1_fekfx0q,1579200427.0,"Can I ask why I should give Togekiss Flamethrower instead of Dazzling Gleam? I understand using Ancient Power because it builds up a lot faster than the others and could be decent for coverage. All I can see Flamethrower covering that Ancient Power wouldn't is Steel, but that's why I have Swampert anyway. I prefer Dazzling Gleam because it has STAB and higher DPE (plus it would let me use the Togekiss in PVE)

Also, given the option of using either Snorlax/Kyogre/Machamp as a third, which would you recommend? Just about everybody is recommending a different one of these lol"
TheSilphArena,fekgyxy,t1_fejst2e,1579199838.0,"I really appreciate you taking the time to analyze it like that :)

Also really glad to say Togekiss was definitely worth working on for a while (you're like the 3rd person to recommend it).

Would you recommend Swampert over Machamp/Lucario though? Another commentor recommended it and it's tempting but I feel Swampert can live through a lot more

I might pick Kyogre and just keep it as a closer, but now am thinking about using Snorlax or Machamp in its place"
TheSilphArena,fekg0yq,t1_fejfv57,1579199272.0,"How would you say it compares to Swampert at countering Steel types? I'm really thinking about putting one on my team but feel like Swampert can do better generally. And I'm pretty much set on using Togekiss to kill Dragons thanks to the other comments

Having a good Fighter seems like it would be pretty cool at the same time though. Could take down any Steel, TTar or Snorlax without much trouble I'd imagine. Would Lucario be any better here though? I know it gets ranked better in Ultra for having a lower max CP and being largely to counter Giratina"
TheSilphArena,feke8v9,t1_fejpz10,1579198215.0,"I did think about using that at one point (almost had him as a wildcard) but figured a single Stone Edge (TTar), or few Rock Slide/Thunderbolt (Melmetal) would drop him too quickly to be worth using
