schizoaffective,ffgrq8v,t3_etgbxi,1579913368.0,"Got a good 11-13 hours of sleep at first when I got on it as well as making me feel null in personality for that period. It didn't end up helping my psychosis and mostly just made me an expert at sleeping. I got off of it for a long time then got back on it as a sleep med as needed, taking a 25mg pill split in half. I keep a lot of coffee energy drinks and Starbucks bottles of coffee next to my bed for getting up and it's probably one of the best decisions I've made in a long while, just because seroquel makes me that degree of lethargic and drowsy when I wake up."
alcoholism,ff4ksvz,t1_ff3hrod,1579566022.0,"I don't doubt that, though my concern is exactly what you said. I know she's at extreme risk at this point of a lot, a lot, a lot of things. Her health is already going downhill and she prefers to ride things out than admit they're as bad as they are. She likes to ride things out and downplay them to be seen as her idea of strong. On top of that, she has a very strong fear of doctors and medications. She either rides things out for months until they either eventually heal up or she accepts them as a part of her life. She just got done riding out a broken bone she got from falling down after having had 22 light beers. She is at way too severe of risk, especially with her health going downhill, for her to not act at this point. But she will absolutely not act until she's already on her death bed.


Having laid out with numbers and examples exactly how severe her drinking is, she mentioned that she knows it's not just sirrhosis she's at a very high risk of. She mentioned she knows the chat wasn't necessarily just about cirrhosis, but also only mentioned cancer being the only other thing. I told her there's a mountain of other things she is at very high risk of that would be very very bad for her in the same way.

Honestly, part of the reason I brought cirrhosis up is because that's the main one that gets brought up anywhere. She knows what it is from TV but sober or not, her cognitive abilities at this point from all the very prolonged heavy drinking makes it very hard for her to understand, process, and retain any information. The only other one of those she would understand with any ease would be cancer, which is complicated. She has some baggage around cancer and refuses to discuss herself having any potential risks of cancer. It's a subject that has historically only made her upset, leading to a lot of denial and drinking.

My stepdad is going to look into resources at work for rehab since he recalls them having assistance for this. She's now saying that she's not sure if she wants to go to rehab or not, which is concerning."
schizoaffective,ff3evbu,t1_ff2uury,1579539644.0,"I take them as needed since I told my psyche that I only want them for emergency use to get out of a bad episode. Ironically, the last time I had a fit of this was when I had taken lamotrigine and rexulti together for the first time."
schizoaffective,ff3e5fy,t1_ff33ijn,1579539257.0,"I only recently started thinking this could be paranoia because I do think everyone is out to get me in any way they can and horrendous things are going to happen, except it's oddly intense where it feels like an entire paranoid episode has been crammed into an entire day or two. 

I don't know, I've just been calling it ""scary brains"" for years and I'm trying to sort out what it could even be. Paranoia isn't one of my main symptoms, it's a constant but it's mild with rare flair ups. This doesn't quite feel like the normal paranoia but god, I don't know what else to call it."
schizoaffective,ff29k2d,t1_ff25a2o,1579497841.0,God I wish I knew what this was called. My psyche didn't seem to understand it and it would probably help my disability case if I had it on file.
bestoflegaladvice,ff271dk,t1_fezz9uy,1579495653.0,"When I saw the Icy Hot condoms for the first time, I had a huge spike of anxiety. I have a menthol allergy and so Icy Hot for me is more akin to ""Hot OH FUCK THAT'S HOT"" due to heat of it combined with the stinging burning sensation of the allergy. Gives me a nice red swollen spot to the areas where the Icy Hot gets applied. Seeing those and being gay, I immediately felt my butt muscles clench up."
schizoaffective,feudadz,t1_fepxoph,1579385460.0,"I did a bunch of reading on it from people discussing my smoking before and this is correct. SZ people have less nicotine receptors and they tend to misfire, while smoking increases helps adjust those. SZ people tend to take in more nicotine from cigarettes as well. The end result in this is an increase in focus, memory, processing speed, and ability to learn. 


My psyche was absolutely not surprised that I smoke considering that it helps with the schiz schiz part of my brain as well as helping my ADHD seeing as it's a stimulant. 


I wouldn't recommend picking up smoking seeing as it's a both a hellishly expensive and unhealthy thing to pick up. I've just accepted at this point that smoking is a part of me."
schizoaffective,feu9v5o,t3_eqf86o,1579384585.0,"That's how seroquel felt when I first started it. Slowed, dull, detached, and all around like my brain had been wiped of things that are ""me"". I'm very eccentric in speech, attitude, and how I respond to things but it felt like it was all sucked out of me and left me as a null. I still get it rarely but seroquel was by far the worst for that since it lasted a week. It's not a fun feeling and I'm really, really sorry you went through that."

HiTMAN,fe6t1ct,t3_enp38g,1578904054.0,"A sawn off shotgun you can carry on your person into a mission and conceal. But on a more serious note, having that but a double barrel or even a single shot so it only holds very limited rounds at a time to help round it out would be fun.

Maybe a syringe loaded with a drug that causes people to get disoriented where they're not aware of their surroundings. Like when someone goes to vomit and can't notice illegal actions except without the part where they actually go to vomit. Could make timing more predictable than non-lethal poison (where people could be gone 10 seconds going somewhere to vomit up to a minute) while also trading off the potential to make your target vomit."
bipolar,fdyv7q7,t3_en5c5w,1578783963.0,I was already confused before lamotrigine. I can't tell if I got regular confusion or lamotrigine induced triple confusion. Or maybe I don't know just because I do have triple confusion..
bipolar,fdyakqz,t1_fdxb1qn,1578777724.0,"Just be careful with that. When I talked to my psyche about my mania, they got really concerned and explained that mania is your brain firing on all cylinders. She said that having your brain firing off absurdly hard, especially for extended periods where you're not really sleeping, is absurdly hard on your brain to where it can cause some damage. Just be safe and get some meds if you're concerned."
schizoaffective,fdy6fle,t3_en8tx0,1578776540.0,It took no time at all for me to start breaking out with acne. It made me tired but also made my legs tingly and restless when I'd try to sleep to the point where I struggled a lot trying to pass out. It was a different kind of experience than RLS and it was a hellish experience trying to sleep. It didn't take me long to stop taking it and my doctor didn't take me serious when I said there was no way I could keep taking it since it would take me about an hour and a half of misery to fall asleep. Absolutely not taking that one again

schizoaffective,fdbxo99,t3_ek7843,1578263539.0,Way more frequently than I would like. I'm thankful that I have people who understand in my life even if it's almost nobody but I'm not thankful that I've alienated everyone else with it. It throws a real wrench into the gears of meeting people.

bipolar,fd0twk8,t1_fczqkv0,1578123701.0,"Start it on a day where you don't have obligations the next day. You're gonna want a feel for how it is before trying that one, I'd recommend. It put me on my ass for 11-13 hours when I started and I'd wake up so sluggish that I started to sleep with premade coffees next to my bed. I'm adjusted to it at this point and so I get an average nights rest now but it still knocks me on my ass in bed within 30-45 minutes."

bestoflegaladvice,fcx0vtx,t1_fcwgr24,1578046222.0,"LAOP did mention that they're bipolar and as someone who is bipolar as well, I'm pretty intimately aware as to how hard it can complicate the whole ""reasonable emotions"" thing. Between fluctuating chemical imbalances of the chemicals that regulate moods along with a consistently inconsistent sleep quality, it can be a good way to have your emotions feel like your brain is spinning a wheel to decide how you'll feel for the day with the worst bonus spins to ever exist for when something could even potentially have an emotional response. 


Gotta say, I'm pretty fond of my mood stabilizers and it'd be a good move for LAOP to look into being able to say the same."
bipolar,fcpqple,t3_eicyov,1577870075.0,It's another day just like tomorrow will be another day. I don't keep track of time like that otherwise I'm gonna have such an existential that I'll tear my head in half.

I've never had any type of STD in my life and I was very less than amused to look at my file after a visit and see that I was put down as HIV+ out of nowhere. I asked him to take it off and instead I somehow ended up being put down as having multiple partners as well. So now my record says I'm HIV+ and sleep with a bunch of people, which is a terrifying combination."
