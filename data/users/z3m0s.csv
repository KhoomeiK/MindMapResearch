Just trying to work out if that's some kinda instilled dog instinct he's got going on there for something.

AskMen,fexqzd6,t1_fexq8np,1579434952.0,"Odd how we flip the words. . . Like I assume they were originally used as they describe but now it's like I willingly enslave myself temporarily to this thing because of how much I enjoy it? I feel like words have lost a lot of meaning. Words like awe-some and captivated should be so powerful but their familiarity ruins them. enthralled though. . . Now that's a fuckin great word, ima be enthralled by the next girl I come across and see how fast she asks to be my Runescape GF."

cancer,fckhvom,t3_ehlk02,1577725685.0,"Although I don't have a Feeding tube success story I did want to share my failed feeding tube story in hopes that you might be reassured somewhat should you experience something similar. SO I had a similar time, hadn't been eating much for a significant amount of time to the point where they said it was time to try the feeding tube and try I did. It was a horrible feeling to experience the tube slowly go up your nose and down your throat, for me they had me focus on drinking water so you kind of just swallow the tube and it goes down easy with no problems. Now I hope it's different in your scenario but for me the thing was unbearable, it was incredibly sensitive in my nose with all the line on the outside causing it to twist and move oddly in the nose, while I could feel the tube in the back of my throat, like something was caught there. It made me gag uncontrollably and I had to have it taken out after no more than 5-10 minutes. BUT, the reason I wanted to share was to ensure you that if it fails for whatever reason like mine did, there is still hope! They don't like it as much because the nutrients doesn't pass through your stomach and it can become lazy and give you problems but they can give you a line that will feed you through your blood stream which is sufficient for short term use while she's getting back on her feet so to speak. Hope this helps give a bit of insight into the process and perhaps ease some stress if it doesn't go to plan, happy holidays!"
cancer,fckggph,t3_ehjp3r,1577724784.0,"I had a very similar time, never really got much of an explanation on why I always wanted to vomit aside from just feeling sick from treatment in general, but the way a dietician described eating to me which helped during this time (My tastebuds were also dead lmao) was that you need to look at food as a task, almost I guess a chore. You have to do it regardless of whether you want to or not, it's like taking your medication. I also sucked at having reasonable portions so I found something that was okay to eat that I could come back to plenty and I'd set varying timers throughout the day and just nibble away until I'd eaten a decent portion, hope this helps! Happy Holidays, stay strong, you'll be good as new in no time!"
