canberra,ffi27xu,t1_ffho2iz,1579962917.0,"I'm not simple.   I have been flooded before, but not that way, and I dealt a lot with insurers.   One of the first things they asked when they did an inspection concerned whether any of the damage was attributable to a lack of maintenance?  You can guess where they were going with that.

So, it's a good idea sometimes to get quotes *outside the context of an insurance claim*, if that concept can be grasped.  You do your roof maintenance and then, when you get  hit by a storm, your claim is clear.    

Non-storm roof damage can be caused by tradies (or amateurs) up there for other reasons, such as solar panels, flue installation, aircon systems, skylights, paint, antennae etc.  Do you think they tell you if they crack a tile while they're up there?

Maybe you have sweet generous insurers who don't care about that?  Lucky old you.

TLDR Sometimes you need a roof quote that you will pay for yourself.  So trust is an issue.  OK?"

You can also differentiate between Tomoe River in the 52gsm and the 68gsm.  

The 52gsm is less absorbent than the 68gsm ie, all the colour and any particulates stay right there on the surface and therefore drying times are longer.  The 52gsm is noticeably thinner than the 68, but somehow is not fragile, so it still feels nice.  It has a soft, beguiling, silky sort of texture . .  

The only ink that I've seen disgrace itself on Tomoe River 52gsm is Noodler's *enfant terrible*, Baystate Blue, and then it was liberally applied with a dip pen.  Looked like a bizarre coral reef."

I had a similar story with AAMI over a year ago with a hailstorm.  They used to be good when they had that damage assessment place out at Fyshwick which took your car in and then commissioned all the necessary repairs. If your insurance covered a hire car, you got a taxi to Hertz and when your car was repaired, you got a taxi back from Hertz.  Last time my car was passed to another repairer  who did a pretty poor job on it and took forever and then broke my key.  Had to take the fight to AAMI HQ to get that fixed.  They have created a lot of personal distance now between the customer and the actual AAMI staff and they obviously don't care for the quality of repairs."

cats,ff9670k,t1_ff8k5z2,1579705787.0,"Well, I am an Australian and my cat is an indoors/outdoors boy.  He likes to watch the birdies but most of the birds around here - whom he has watched me feeding, throughout this long drought - are big enough to do him serious damage  - Aussie magpies, various raucous cockatoos, currawongs, correllas, mobs of galahs.  Once he got over the shock, the dismay even, he just watched this from a very safe distance.  He and the other cats in this development spend their outdoors time mostly watching each other, making sure nobody trespasses in another's territory.  They take the odd mouse still (mice and sparrows are imported vermin here).   I've never once seen him with any little marsupial things.

It is mistaken to suggest that any of these cats would be 'just as satisfied' indoors.  He's fit, he's active, he's out on the roof and he's 9.  I don't want one of those fat, timid ""chonkers"", peering miserably out the window to a world we have forbidden him.  It is no coincidence, I am sure, that feline obesity has risen in line with childhood obesity, for the same reason.  

As for responsibility, let she who is without sin cast the first stone.  We need perspective here.  Every single dwelling in Australia, or America, is built by humans on land that was once virgin wildlife habitat, plain or forest, often quite recently.  Our homes are built from materials harvested from the land (at best).  We travel on roads that carve up the bushland, closing off migration corridors, sitting in steel boxes that spew out poisons, and every day, we discard plastics and crap that pollutes these lands.   The explosion in ""Tree Changers""  developments in once secluded areas of bushland is having no small role to play in the current fire crisis here in Oz.  Cats are not Australia's real problem, humans are, but we do love to point the finger.  There's a whole other debate about the virtues of trying to snap-freeze a 1788 Goldilocks version of our ecology, instead of letting all inhabitants strike a new balance, as must have occurred in the Old World, but that's a debate for a different forum.

 Australia has sustained some terrible damage in the recent fires, *some of it caused directly by humans*, none by cats.  Don't say, like a doomsayer, that 'Australia is burnt to a crisp'.  Don't take your news from Facebook; there are still large areas unburnt.   It will take some time, but the bush will eventually revover.  It is fire-regenerative by nature.  We don't know yet what the full dreadful impact on wildlife will be.   The impact on farming areas has been pretty terrible though.  BTW, we are all astonished and  extremely grateful for the donations and assistance given by people overseas; it has made a real difference to people and animals.  I hope we will be just as generous when others are in peril."
