relationship_advice,fgibw7t,t3_eyhfvm,1580815977.0,"I'm curious why/how your parents found your sister's intimate items? That's kind of creepy depending on the circumstances. 

Also the solution is very simple. ""Nope we're going to continue as planned, as it's MY birthday. If you'd no longer like to participate, I understand. I love you, have a great day!"" Your sister didn't get ""caught"" with this shit in THEIR house, she got caught with it in HERS. Your parents are not only acting like children, but they invaded HER space, period. If your parents can't get it together for your birthday, then that's on them and them alone. IMO"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgiblfu,t1_fggbk79,1580815591.0,"Look up the difference between criminal courts (in the context of criminalizing nonviolent drug offenders) and drug courts (in the context of the requirements).

1. In the states/counties that offer drug courts as an option to nonviolent drug offenders it's extremely difficult to enter into. One of the requirements to enter into a drug court program is that your only offense is your addiction itself. 

2. Unlike criminal court rehabilitation is mandated and that's extremely important! Furthermore, it's understood and recognized that relapse is in fact part of the process of recovery. 

3. Because of the fact that in drug courts addiction isn't criminalized, upon completion of the drug court program the offenders record is expunged. 

4. Because the record is expunged the ""offender"" no longer has the ""scarlet letter"" (in the form of a felony/prison time/record hanging over their head) and therefore they're able to get gainful employment and not only contribute back to society, but to the program as well. 

5. As the result of #4 the drug court program is not only more effective, it's more cost effective too. On average it costs between 14K and 23K annually per inmate in traditional prisons, whereas in drug courts it costs between 7K to 10K and again the nonviolent drug offender in drug courts is able to contribute back to his/her program lessening the financial burden on the system.

6. Thinking about those numbers above, thinking also about privatized prisons and what do you have? Did you know that the majority of our prison population consists of drug offenders, many of whom are nonviolent drug offenders. Meanwhile you've got people like Brock Turner serving 3 months for rape! Why? MANY reasons, but one of which is the fact that there's no room in the Inn. Drug offenses are the bread and butter of the American prison system. In the context of privatized prisons it's profitable and in the context of state run prisons it's an excellent tool for convincing the public that the ""War on drugs"" is in fact effective! When in fact that's not the case and war on drugs coupled with programs like D.A.R.E, are systemically VERY expensive and ineffective (I could speak on those subjects both from a personal stand point and empirically all day). Why do you think marijuana is a scheduled I drug? I don't even use the shit and wholeheartedly believe it has NO business being a scheduled I drug, but for the reasons above it's there. The definition of a scheduled I drug is the following; easily accessible, highly addictive and no medicinal purposes. Wouldn't cigarettes and alcohol also follow that same criteria? Hmmmm looks like some substances didn't make it into the ""War on Drugs"" list, not to mention the abuse of prescription drugs.... BUT that's a totally different Jerry Springer show and I'm getting off topic. 

7. Again all of this wouldn't be possible if the nonviolent drug offender didn't meet the many requirements to enter drug court to begin with. One of those being that their only offense is their addiction. Therefore I'm not just making up my own definition, I'm referring to the definition set forth by drug courts. Which btw is also statistically more effective, than criminal courts."

Everyone else can fuck off! I'm referring to those who are not guilty of anything other than doing drugs themselves. Criminalizing addiction is wrong IMO and sending a non violent offender to prison will surely do two things: 1. Give them a scarlet letter which they'll carry around for life (which is why Bernie is advocating for expungement). 2. They'll more than likely turn to violence in the future.

Even if trump isn't racist, the shit he says propels it and those who do have hatred in their hearts towards other ethnicities now believe they have a voice. And if you're wondering why I said, ""racism"" it's because at the end of the day race is a very fictional word, with very real life and serious consequences. From a sociological point of view the only race is the human race and the powers that be first used that word to evoke fear and to divide..... mission accomplished.
