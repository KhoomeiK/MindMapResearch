AskWomen,fene98r,t3_eq16tj,1579282814.0,"I think, like everyone has been saying, it really depends on the friendships. You start to realize by the actual interactions whether it’s a flaw or it’s them not valuing you (you can usually tell when someone ends up just talking about themselves and gives very short replies). All my friends are very bad at initiating text conversations, but make an effort to make me feel good when we hang out. I just handle it by thinking about the quality times I’ve had with them. If I can’t think of much or anything, it’s probably time to cut them out."
