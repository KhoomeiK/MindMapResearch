dankmemes,ff8m1um,t1_ff8lpt2,1579685195.0,"Well cool, sjws are one of the many tens of thousands of people who fit into the category of stalwart college supporters that fucked up by getting a degree that isn't applicable either now or ever, but they aren't the only ones, just enjoy the meme, there's plenty of valid reasons to trash it but this isn't one of them"
dankmemes,ff8lxnz,t1_ff8lrlt,1579685014.0,"^^kinda hilarious that they jump to the conclusion that it's a jab at sjws tho, kinda pathetic that people just assume that everyone is ""out to get you"" for your beliefs"

summonerschool,fer165l,t3_eqfh5n,1579348466.0,"The reason for it is becuz they have timestamps on in chat, so when they ping it at say, 7:53, they know it'll be back up at 12:53(?) Since flash has a 5(?) Minute cd. Otherwise it's just developing the awareness to keep track of things like that in the back of your head, and remember then when it's most important(dragon coming up, trading in lane that you win and all in on, etc...)"
LifeProTips,feqgs2o,t3_eqd3op,1579341691.0,"I think about it in a similar way, but more based on how long I will find it pleasing/useful, if it's a game I know I'll play for say, 50+ hours, and it's $60, I'm basically getting 50+ hours of entertainment for 6 ish hours of work"

Says one even remotely racist thing, well now they're a racist bigot and deserve to get jumped for such hideous language. Really puts ""equality"" into perspective for ya"
