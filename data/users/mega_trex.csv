technology,fgv0xuj,t1_fgtvp65,1581134083.0,"Basically EV/PHEV manufacturer out there only lets you charge to like ~75% to preserve the battery life. Tesla said fuck that we know better and let you charge to 100% for maximum range on their original cars. Then they went ""oh shit we shouldn't have done that"" and slowly started taking away more and more range via software limiting for people who already paid expecting a specific range. There's a class action lawsuit for it now."

Christianity,fgux9g8,t1_fguo19l,1581131501.0,Treat them like valuable humans outside of dating purposes. Join some meet up groups or something so you can meet people with similar interests. If you hang out with someone and have a romantic interest ask them on a casual date and eventually start dating them. Either join a Christian group or ask about it early on if it's a deal breaker.

Christianity,fgu8ex9,t3_f0i0df,1581114846.0,I was always taught angels don't have free will since the Bible says they were created to do God's bidding. Since Satan is a fallen angel that means God wanted him to do that. But that's one of those things you'd get punished for bringing up at my church.

The Catholic Church is the richest denomination out of any religion in the world. Instead of helping the poor they are using it to get rape victims to shut up. They deserve to be called out 150%

todayilearned,fgsapr9,t1_fgs7ay0,1581078727.0,"No. You can never be tried for the same crime, new evidence doesn't matter. That's why you don't rush to trial with a dumbass prosecution case. OJ Simpson (also definitely guilty dude was a documented abusive piece of shit) wrote a book about how he did it and no one could do anything because double jeopardy."

todayilearned,fgrtaap,t1_fgrt69b,1581056783.0,Do you have a source I can read? Everything I've seen has said that the prosecution missed it.
todayilearned,fgrrvjw,t1_fgrffgk,1581055403.0,"Yeah because the prosecution & police were a major fuckup. The defense knew what was in her search history and were waiting for the prosecution to bring it up. When they never did the defense was like ... Ok cool. IIRC there were several major pieces of evidence we know now that the prosecution didn't even know about. 

And Caylee's body would have been found before it decomposed if the police weren't lazy pieces of shit. The guy that saw the trashbag with the body called in like 3-4 times and the police kept ignoring it cause they didn't want to get dirty in the swamp. So her body sat there rotting for months in the humidity. So much evidence lost because of that.

Knowjng what I know now, she is definitely guilty. But if I was on that jury and only had the shitty case the prosecution tried to pass off I wouldn't be able to say she was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."

news,fgrmjxe,t1_fgqzqtr,1581050772.0,"Other tests are for teaching. What does this test even teach you? That you're bad at pull ups? It's not even like they teach you anything leading up to it that they're testing, they're just like go do pullups now.

Did any of you even care how you did on the presidential fitness test? This doesn't eliminate any form of testing in PE just the generic run a mile and do some pullups one. Seems much more useful to teach fitness and verify people have learned something rather than this."
BeautyGuruChatter,fgrj8dd,t1_fgrcup0,1581048197.0,I think they will eventually rebrand completely. She talked about in the video how they are probably keeping the name for now for awareness until people who like it know it's a totally new brand.

""Pressed pigment"" is their way of getting around a lawsuit if you lose an eye because they ""didn't advertise it for use in the eye area"". It means it has ingredients that violate what the FDA has approved as eye safe.
