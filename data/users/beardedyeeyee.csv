My parents are aging and I can tell, it really hurts me brother, if I had them here with me things would be way easier :""/"

depression,fcwxgay,t1_fcvo82g,1578041772.0,"Oh brother, it seems that what people say about don't needing anyone else to be happy is not true, I agree with you, not having someone that's there for you is just sad, I broke up with my gf, that got me kind of sad but what really brought me down is that recently I texted this one girl that really made me feel happy, in the past I've had asked her out about four times and she said no, this last time she said she is taken already and she's happy :""/  I'm a little glad because she's happy even though I'm not, I'm really afraid of what's going to happen with me the day she gets married and I'm barely 19 :""/"
