AskReddit,fcvp4gi,t1_fcurr6w,1578006933.0,"I was lucky enough to get ELS’d from recruit training (Marines) a few weeks ago. Went in thinking I was going to be a badass operator of some kind like you said. It’s not like that, it’s nothing like what you think. Don’t join the military with some sort of “badass” fantasy, you will be disappointed. And your body will have tons of physical problems by the time you’re done if you do infantry or something like that, even if you never had any combat injuries. Just from carrying heavy shit and other manual labor. I spent 10 weeks in recruit training, don’t have any experience on the job obviously, but saw quite a few of drill instructors with knee and back issues from just being in the Marines. And plenty of privates all the way up to corporals cleaning rooms and shit with me (while I was in RSP), not doing their actual MOS, complaining to me about the Marines, telling me I was doing the right thing getting out."
