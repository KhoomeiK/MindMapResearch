AskReddit,ff9ely6,t3_es8f05,1579711350.0,"My dad represented a utility company in a major city in the southern US. He says that on the electrical side they are already at maximum production for electricity and before too long there won't be enough power to go around. The only saving thing is that there could be advancements in technology that could help with power consumption.

This isn't a conspiracy theory type thing either. This is real and the electrical companies already have a plan in place to which areas can have power and when just in case it happens before expected.

Additionally, water is becoming harder and harder to get to everyone even in the US so within 25 years we will have to start rationing unless something changes. I think this could cause mass panic and maybe pretty terrifying for awhile."
