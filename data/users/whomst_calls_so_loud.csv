AskReddit,ffeh49y,t1_ffeev78,1579847779.0,Seriously sick psychotic break you fucking weirdo who else have you freaked out on about shit they clearly weren't saying today?
AskReddit,ffegxo4,t1_ffeev78,1579847575.0,"Suffering is not a competition I'm just saying the us healthcare system is bad you weirdo. Please do yourself and everyone around you a favor and grow the fuck up.

And for the record I never once implied people in other places don't have it worse than Americans you psycho. You are severely fucking stupid, so please refer to the first portion of my post and grow the fuck up. Nobody cares that you don't like Americans."
AskReddit,ffe2hn9,t1_ffdzunj,1579834985.0,"Like there was a local story 2017 a 7 year old died of a chronic illness because the local hospital network refused to believe his parents he was sick

Another case this year with a 28 year old dude with lung cancer, refused to believe him or test him cause poor. Another case last fall with another 20 something year old dude with pancreatic cancer, doctors ignored the early signs.
 
My best friend had a chronic illness and was coughing up blood and eventually gave up because the local hospital would just wait for him to stop bleeding and then discharge him. He ended up just not going back when i fucking begged him to go to the er. Drowned in his blood. Please do not tell me what the healthcare system is like here. I literally just lost my best friend because of how uncaring local doctors are."
AskReddit,ffe297w,t1_ffdzunj,1579834812.0,"Hospital beds are cot quality but can be sat up, bravo. Also people regularly die in the US healthcare system pretending that's not true is mad gross my dude."
AskReddit,ffdxbdh,t1_ffdu5k6,1579831241.0,Yeah that's what they do to poor peeps here.
AskReddit,ffdta8v,t1_ffdq6nx,1579828380.0,"True enough. But in the US you lie in a cot and they tell you you don't have a chronic condition and you get a medication resistant fungal infection and a $10,000 bill so its not 100% the same but pretending the US healthcare system is good is ignorant as all hell.

Trust me hospitals let people die of treatable conditions here far too often."
AskReddit,ffdq63j,t1_ffdp23v,1579826296.0,That's what conservatives do though
AskReddit,ffdq14s,t1_ffdou1w,1579826211.0,Yeah its literally the same in the US except it costs you $800 for a bag of saline at baseline prices. The point is corrupt weirdos exist everywhere.
AskReddit,ffdpvvr,t1_ffdopjd,1579826118.0,I like how you're using Soviet Russian healthcare to make a definitive statement about socialized medicine. Canadians don't go through this shit dawg.
Fantasy,ffaevnz,t1_ff8o8ax,1579734063.0,You just sold me on getting around to reading those.
Fantasy,ffaema3,t1_ff8lg8o,1579733858.0,I still need to read those I'm a bad daddy Brooks fan.
Fantasy,ffael7e,t1_ffaedml,1579733834.0,"It's not just on reddit, Ive gotten shit for fanboying Bropks by a plethora of people who are mean about fandoms all over the place lmao. Ive noticed that most people who hate on Terry Brooks The Sword and were like ""this is Tolkienistic everything he's done is a Tolkien rip off,"" but they don't remember the plot beyond parts that mirror LOTR, or key characters, and generally haven't even read the other books. Also a tendency to ignore he wrote The Sword when he was 18. Not saying this is the case with everyone, but if i see another corny old dude insisting The Elfstones and The Wishsong are LOTR rips I'm going to scream."
Fantasy,ff7ymtc,t1_ff7ygxo,1579661482.0,To be fair that is a huge plot hole though
Fantasy,ff7xgtl,t1_ff7wv2q,1579660673.0,"I actually like the dwarves just being the least mutated of the other races but to each their own. And i always ponder about all of the demon/word/void stuff however I've rationalized it as >!there are powerful enough demons that escape the forbidding, especially during periods where the Elcrys needs to be reincarnated, and that possibly all demons are just things warped by the void. As for the Lady maybe she only intervenes in periods of extreme crisis. I know I'm giving it a ton of benefit of the doubt but I'm just very attatched to the metaseries lmao.!<"
Fantasy,ff7v367,t1_ff7tm8d,1579659061.0," Ok I love that it's all connected, and i have some sloiler disputes with you sir! Lol.

 >!The elven Kingdom the Cintra is in the woods of Oregon, Armageddon's Children takes place largely in Seattle.

As for the Dwarves, they live in the dense woods to the East in the Anar. They descended from peoples who sheltered underground during the apocalyptic era which is why they're short of stature. 

As for wraiths and the like The Word & Void Trilogy suggests that there were many faerie and demon creatures living in the world but more in secret before the apocalypse. Eg O'Olish Amenah, the Windego, the Gypsy Morph, the faeries in Wales. Something about the apocalypse triggered old magic to re-emerge on a larger scale though what that is I'm not quite sure lmao. I'm fine with there being lost history though.!<"
Fantasy,ff7rcbs,t3_eryo8n,1579656484.0,"I cannot get into The Wheel Of Time though I've read excerpts i absolutely adored. It's just like, Jordan nailed it with some characters and others are just weird."
Fantasy,ff7omme,t1_ff7n9on,1579654580.0,"Respect that, the man really blessed us with so much beautiful material. I've read The Wishsong, The First King, The Word & The Void idk how many times but not enough.

For me re-reading books is fantastic because of the tendency one has to forget the small details. When revisiting stories details you didn't or couldn't appreciate when you were younger pop out, like exploration of a protagonist or major character's mental health, the foreshadowing, symbolism or the author's sense of humor."

therapy,fedt6s1,t1_fedt11s,1579019365.0,There you go being aggressively negative over nothing again. Do you seriously not see my point about projection? Of course you take bashing fandoms as trying to hurt people as you're obviously trying to hurt my feelings over a minor disagreement. If you're gonna just continue to insult me for disagreeing with you i can just disengage dude. I hope you can work through whatever negativity is plagueing you though.
therapy,fedrrco,t1_fedrm65,1579018486.0,"Im talking specifically in the case of bashing fandoms lol. Much like the content being discussed, this disagreement isn't a huge slight so there really isn't any reason to take it so personally. Maybe we're just both projecting our attitudes tho? :-*"

therapy,fecp8cn,t3_ent3w4,1578979762.0,"As a pedantic music nerd who makes fun of everything, i hope you understand that a lot of people hate on things as a joke and that it's inconsequential. People who actually intend to hurt you over fandoms are absurd in their negativity and dorkiness, so in turn they too are inconsequential as you really shouldn't want to interact with people that meh. Your feelings on the other hand do matter which is why i really want you to understand that people are going to hate on everything on the internet for lols and that its generally nothing personal."
