malefashionadvice,fef0g41,t3_eotptw,1579045272.0,Those are dope.
CFB,fedt1cd,t1_fecowre,1579019274.0,I threw a party in high school and charged a cover and had my buds help usher and collect and this is essentially what happened. I sent a group text saying “whatever’s in your pockets you can keep it” it was wild
vscosluts,fe9al00,t1_fe9aamv,1578935888.0,Big yikes energy
vscosluts,fe8m10k,t1_fe8gnd5,1578927744.0,She explains in one of her posts. She’s censoring them so they aren’t reported.
raspberry_pi,fe5u991,t3_enr0go,1578875073.0,I want to be this good at code
GolfGTI,fe0pjqs,t3_enidrj,1578817198.0,Why isn’t this shit factory by now like it would save so much trouble.
LearnUselessTalents,fdckn3n,t1_fdcjyui,1578277261.0,Aww thank you! Yeah try it out!

LearnUselessTalents,fd9q7x4,t3_ekcl4y,1578236634.0,"A splash of vinegar (white, but tbh any kind works) will make the shell pretty much fall off. No effect on the taste either."
Vans,fcnufcr,t1_fcnqon1,1577818630.0,Yeah I feel like y’all are both right. I cleaned these once a month or every time they got scuffed and even on their worst nights they made the comeback. The fact that I had Reebok classics to alternate with probably cut the wear down by like half.
vandwellers,fcmnrbk,t3_ehrhuh,1577783326.0,Too* sorry
therewasanattempt,fby4cof,t3_eeyzxr,1577207787.0,Ppl weren’t getting it in the comments thought I’d help out. Of course that was when the gif had no likes and I was one of like 5 comments.
