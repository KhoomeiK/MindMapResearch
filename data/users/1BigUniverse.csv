funny,ffxyunt,t1_ffxrrgz,1580335121.0,"as a former server I can say that when people get their steaks like this more often than not its going to get sent back. They get the steak and will usually say something along the lines of ""it's far too dry"" and instead of just getting it medium well first and going up from there, we have to start them a completely new steak. Not always the case, but I'd say a majority of the time it is."
