Zika was dangerous because you literally had hundreds of thousands of people congregating into a mosquito infested olympics.  The actual danger of Zika didn't manifest until the pregnant woman had a severely disabled child.  But fast mosquito control really helped stem it.

Wuhan virus is a coronavirus. They are usually fairly contagious through droplets and usually only cause mild URI symptoms. This wuhan virus is killing people at a higher than normal rate of a typical coronavirus.  So yeah it doesn't have the mortality of ebola but it has the capacity to spread quickly.

Insurance companies got their profit % capped...so they just make more money by raising prices, which makes the pie bigger and then makes their % of the pie bigger.
