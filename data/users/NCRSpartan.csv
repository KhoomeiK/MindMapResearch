dating_advice,ffdy94a,t3_et3gkf,1579831913.0,"Im in a relationship with a 35 year old, im 26.

The difference you will see is maturity level, their response time to texting, their communication skills, their priorities, experience toward intimacy.

You are not gunna be dating a giggly little girl thats a play now pay later gal. You are going to be dating a gal who expects you to be a man and step up to the plate. One who doesnt have time for bullshit and wants you to have your shit together. 

Her priority is her career and future, will you be apart of her future or not? Thats entirely up to your actions.

Also some women in their 30s love to have younger guys pay attention to em.

If you want to pursue something. Be upfront but never ever Rush things. Build into it with dates with her and build attraction. Have a good time. If it leads to the sheets. She knows what she wants and communicate what you like too.

If shes a quality woman... you're gunna work your ass off to prove you are worthy. They know all the tricks"

No party harty bullshit"
relationships,ffcwine,t3_esy42l,1579808737.0,Low confidence in him it seems. Do you reassure him on this? Him showing the appropriate amount of love? Do you show him you're grateful?
relationships,ffcv1cs,t3_esxldd,1579807836.0,"You are making quite a bit of mistakes here most guys do in a relationship. First off you are showing desperate and codependent qualities and sound clingy. This sort of action turns women off. Quit it.

A woman who seems less interested in you is due to a few big things. You arent giving her space, you are too available, you're texting and calling way too much, and your center focus on life is that relationship. You need to understand something, when a woman knows shes got you wrapped around her finger and knows that if she wants you to be somewhere with her... you will drop everything you are doing to be there.

Once she understands that, the attraction you created for her slowly disappears to the point shes got you thinking shes bored with you. Now you are scrambling to figure out whats wrong, what did you do, how can you fix it?

First off, give her space. Be less responsive and put her into a curious mindset so she reaches out to you. When she asks you what you been up too, dont give her full descriptive answers. Just say you have been focusing on your career, hanging with friends, and enjoying hobbies. Heres the thing. You must actually be doing this stuff. Itll help you. But do not immediately respond to her, give it a few hours. And after your first response wait an hour or 2 to respond. This will get her wondering why your response times have slowed down. What you are doing is making her reach out to you. Your target response time to her texts would be every 20 mins after her message to you.

See alot of people will try to discredit the next things im gunna say.

Women want a guy whose confident, high self esteem, has priorities that are more important than the relationship, has life priorities, and humor.

What women subconsciously want is to chase the guy, guys chase them all day and thats boring. But when you put them in a position of chasing you. It creates attraction, curiousity, mysteriousness. Women want a guy who is a leader and an alpha (idc what anyone says about this, but this is fact) they want the guy to take charge. 

To rid the mindset of being Boring, you gotta re-attract her. Shes pushing you away, dont chase. let her come back to you. Be less responsive, less available, and less focused on the relationship...

Biggest advice i can give... you are responsible for your happiness, no one else is. Do not rely on others to keep you going. That is solely your responsibility."
relationships,ffcs0rl,t3_esxgj5,1579806068.0,"Ohhh my god... the relationship was over when you both became unfaithful. 

Now you guys are in the process of hoping something gets better. But deep down you must look at if this is something you want anymore. The cheating aint gunna stop on both parties. Thats a given.

Save yourself from anymore hurt and focus on your future. But leave the cheating shit out of it. Zero excuse for it."

relationships,ff4yffs,t3_ero148,1579575457.0,"Communicate it. Does he know you're getting depressed? Do you explain what obstacles in school that has you exhausted? Do you take the time to listen to him and help come up with solutions? Do you put effort into communicating with him? Are you showing affection toward him that might be less than what it was before?

Are there things you did as a friend that he wishes you still do? If he doesnt go into detail, try to communicate that.

All of this just requires communication and patience. Address feelings, opinions, and questions. Listen to each other."
relationships,ff4xslp,t3_ero7mu,1579575016.0,"Who gives a shit what everyone else is doing and what pace they are taking in their lives.

Thats their choice.

You have a successful relationship, thats something to be happy about. But if this topic is a real big concern for you. Communicate that to your SO, have a sit down with him and discuss what he wants in the future, tell him what you want. Be on the same page.

But never never never be jealous of your peers, you're not there to be like everyone else. You are doing fine at your pace. Relax. Dont compare you and your relationship with others."

relationships,fekm9a7,t3_epnuju,1579202986.0,"Well women tend to be the ones who lose attraction or excitement for their SO more often than men. Its normal. 

What seems to be going on is that you both arent doing anything exciting together like you probably all did when you were first together. Prolly doing the same old boring stuff. Gotta change that up. Try new things! A guy who works alot does tend to want to do relaxing things. But communicate this with him on how you feel cuz if it goes unheard. That means drifting apart is a possibility where it can be completely avoided with communication.

Are you focused on goals or a career at all? These should actually be a priority in your life and ridding that ""boring"" feeling cuz its distraction and it gives you time to miss him too.

Voice the concern... always communicate."

I understand that this is your first heartbreak, the first is always the hardest. We all been there. From a person with the unfortunate experience in heartbreak... the last thing you want to do is dwell on it. You should look into healing yourself and thats gunna be a long road man.

But take what you learned from this and apply it to your next relationship in the future. Carrying around past relationship baggage is gunna ruin you. I know cuz i did it. It sucks but its life and life isnt fair.

Took me 4 years to get back into a relationship. Thats only because i dwelled on the break up, was desperate to get her back, and i blamed myself for it even tho she cheated on me. Damn near took my own life cuz i couldnt handle it.

Do not be me. Get yourself out of that living condition, surround yourself with positive friends and family, focus on you, your hobbies, and your interests. You are 21 man... the same age i was when i got my heart ripped out. Healing is your priority."
relationships,fdsfhyd,t3_emzij3,1578701572.0,"Problem here isnt her, the problem is that you are still attached and it seems to be toxic.

You haven't accepted that this happened to you. You are assuming that she didnt feel terrible for the transition, or the fact that the 6 years was on her mind and she was hurting at the time.

You are hurt to the point that you want to punish her for something that she doesnt have control over. She grew up and realized her attraction changed toward the same gender.

It is time for you to grow up and get over it. Shes not wrong. Shit happens. There are so many women out there. You will be fine.

Allow yourself to heal man. Stop being toxic and punishing her cuz of the heart break. Live your life."

I put those on and bloused them low enough to look normal. And the shoes looked so painfully obvious they werent boots... but no one noticed.
