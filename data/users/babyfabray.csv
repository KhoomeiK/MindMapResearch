socialanxiety,fgiqfyu,t3_eynv60,1580828577.0,I actually told one of my friends I wanna get the corona virus so I don’t have to go to school (mainly because social interaction and fuck school in general) and she said “don’t say that!!” but ugh I really hope I do get it because I’m tired of school and having to do stuff in general. If I got it I could just sleep all day :’)
