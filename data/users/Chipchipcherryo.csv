IAmA,fezo2r5,t1_fezlkbq,1579459541.0,I would shy away from regulating this because it could be and is really helpful to people struggling.  Say you have a vehicle that you owe 4K on and you find out you need to pay 2K in repairs.

You are adding this detail to my scenario.  In my scenario, the 2nd toy dealer is giving $0 value for the trade in which creates a -8 equity added to the $10 toy purchase.  

I attempted to illustrate the idea of transferring negative equity to a new purchase in a simple way.  Does it make sense to trade something in and get no value for it?  Probably not but it is my scenario and I get to chose what happens in it.  If you or someone adds extra details into it, you shouldn’t then tell me I’m wrong based on the new details you insert."

I guess I’m not making my point as clear as I thought.  The person rolled the -8 equity into the new toy which cost 10 dollars.  The did not put anything down for the new toy except for giving up to the toy seller. So instead of borrowing the 10 dollars for the toy, the give the go to the person as a trade in and get the new toy.  The would then owe 18 for a 10 dollar toy."

According to forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden, who was hired by Jeffrey Epstein's brother to look into the death and was present during the autopsy, the fingerprints on the body found in Epstein's cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in the early morning of August 10, 2019 match the fingerprints taken of Epstein when he was booked during a 2006 arrest in Florida.  

He is definitely super dead guys.  The proof is the finger prints match.  No photos or anything.  Just the guy his brother hired to do the autopsy saying he is definitely dead.  That puts my kid at ease.  Shut this sub down. /s"
