SuicideWatch,ff8fjjb,t1_f6xc4bf,1579676274.0,"Late response, but to me that is the only genuine sentiment here. It makes me feel like someone acknowledges that it’s painful here, all the time, no matter what. So thank you for saying that you hope I do get to experience peace after all this suffering. My feelings are validated. I hate the “it gets better” or “what can I do” responses. It doesn’t get better, and if I can’t do shit for my sled, then how can anyone else, realistically?

Thanks for letting me vent."

BeautyGuruChatter,fdu1kb7,t1_fdounla,1578725876.0,"Yeah, that felt really mean spirited and unfair. Once commenter vs a well-known YouTuber? And she wouldn’t drop it and frankly acted like a B.
