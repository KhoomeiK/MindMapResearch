AskWomenOver30,fff83fv,t3_et70ce,1579878068.0,"I didn't quit jobs, per see, just transferred to a different unit.  I stayed within the same company so I still see the staff from my former unit all the time, a few of which have rudely stated I made a mistake to transfer. And you know what? I ignored them all!  I knew in my heart I made the damn right decision!  I did not feel like I was running away at all.  I just finally came to the conclusion that perhaps those particular set of responsibilities were not something I specifically wanted for the rest of my career life.  

My line of thinking is, we spend so much time at work compared to the rest of our lives outside of it.  Why in the hell am I gonna be at work AND be unhappy too?? No friggin way that'll fly.  So as soon as there's something that truly makes me unhappy (like say to the point of having an anxiety attack), I peace out of that place because it is definitely not worth my happiness and peace of mind."
AskWomen,fff77ms,t3_et472p,1579877460.0,"Slowly and with patience.  Understanding that it is not a timed process.  You cant put a time stamp on it and shouldn't be discouraged if you dont feel any different in however many seconds, minutes, hours, days,etc. It is always an on going process.  

Learn to forgive yourself.  Self hatred easily stems from self blame, believing something was your fault when it might not have been at all."
