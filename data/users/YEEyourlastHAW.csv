We were with a group of people and were going to meet at an Arby’s, but there were too many people to fit in a car so people broke out to meet there. He offered me a ride and I said sure. 

We did not go to Arbys. We went to a Chinese restaurant that was formally a church. He then ordered for me and told me all about his family’s money and the vacations they take . Afterwards we went to Walmart so he could see if they had any new hot wheels. 

When we finally met back up with everyone else my ass unclenched and I made sure to never be left alone with the guy again."
