There's a difference between your new favorite buzzword ""whataboutism"" and direct comparison to evaluate impact.  Maybe you should figure that out before you toss Reddit words around.  We use direct comparison to compare the impact of your usage vs other usage, which is entirely fair and how you should objectively look at things.

I'm not calling for wireless to replace anything.  I'm just doing the real simple math that phone charging doesn't matter at all to the environment or the economy.

We'd be better off shutting down Walmart if you really cared about the environment, not just making yourself feel good.  Your fridge also uses more power in a day than your phone does in a month, so maybe unplug your fridge.

Why not switch to completely wireless and have 100% waterproof phones?  The charge port and remaining physical buttons is the only reason we still have water ""resistant"" phones.  'Tis better to let phones be destroyed and replaced every year than make them waterproof and slightly less efficient, amirite?

But I guess 60-80% efficiency is just too far away from the 85-95% wired offers."
