OntarioLandlord,feyampz,t1_fey9kan,1579443054.0,"Not entirely sure what you mean about registered or designated. The police stated because it is one address, and not separate units, I can not  press a charge. All they can do is come and warm them not to do it (which they did). Since there was no weapon involved it wasn’t seen as a threat.

I figured there would be a possibility of adding it to my lease since my lease states I’m leasing the listed address and there is no indication of there being an upper and lower unit."
OntarioLandlord,fewm73p,t1_fewlqsa,1579414360.0,"The concern wasn't with mailboxes but moreso the house isn't designated as separate dwellings but under one address. It's also the reason I could not  report a trespass or any other charge to the downstairs renter who came in during a psychotic episode they were having. There is a better lock on the door now.

I updated the post about with other details about the unit that don't seem up to code. So I'm assuming it's a Bylaw issue. If it's not a legal unit, would I be forced to move out as well or would the downstairs just need to be brought up to code/given as part of my lease?"

ottawa,felpdwt,t1_felp7uu,1579227697.0,I wanted to get Siri to write down the plate number but they were too far ahead in the passing lane and I was in the middle. Bummer. The loud thud made me think the roof of my car got dented but it looks fine.
OntarioLandlord,felo2e1,t1_felgb7q,1579226794.0,Thanks so much for clearing this up! :)

OntarioLandlord,fek80nh,t1_fek3k19,1579194528.0,"They just wrote me:

""I thought it can go up by 2% every year, but I thought with the changeover, I mean new renters, you can set what rent you like (within reasons), surely!  You have to cover your expenses!  Let me know if I’m wrong.  I just did the accounts and saw the shortfall so I was going to say raise it for new renters, and only 3 to 4 % for the existing ones.  We can talk about it, I’m not saying this month or next, it has to be done soon so why not when there is a 50% changeover.

I would be interested in your thoughts as you are in the business.  Doesn’t it automatically go up every year, elsewhere?  It has to, because every thing else does!""

I wrote a lengthly email but basically boiled down to me telling her to get informed of ontario rental laws and how she should know this before buying a house to rent it"
OntarioLandlord,fek33al,t1_fek2rob,1579191579.0,"Hey there,  
I am the sole leaseholder, my border/roommates pay rent to me and I pay a lump sum to the homeowner.  
Yes, new lease was drawn up using one of the new RTA streamlined rental agreement forms in November 2017. It states 'one year' and $1750 and then legal babble about rent increases by legal limit after one year. It's also written that she can't increase my rent for two years, making that this past November 2019 I believe."

OntarioLandlord,fehb74g,t1_fehajy4,1579112958.0,"I’m not sure. I had explained it the same.

I rented the house, lived in one of said rooms, and then allowed the rooms to be rented out month-to-month. Shared amenities. They just said because there was no agreement/signing and with the shared space that they didn’t fall under the RTA."
OntarioLandlord,feh9vez,t1_feh9p3i,1579112166.0,"That’s so strange because over a year ago the board literally told me they were sublets when I asked how their situation is classified lol. Wonderful, thanks!"

OntarioLandlord,feh8ptg,t1_feh55xm,1579111466.0,"Hey there,

I have a signed lease with the homeowner. My sublets have not ever signed anything. The agreement is month to month (no first/lasts upfront either). It’s a verbal agreement that I give them and vice versa 2 months notice for leaving/termination.

I’ve talked with the board and police for a different person and they stated they are not covered under the RTA and could be kicked at any point because we share kitchen/bathroom, etc."
