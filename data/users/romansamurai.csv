#Cheating is cheating 

It doesn’t matter what sex they’re cheating with.  

Why do people this it’s ok to do this because “they’re exploring their sexuality”?  Why do they think then it’s not considered cheating. And why do they think their partner should accept it?  

This is still painful and wrong. **She’s nothing but a cheater and a liar**. 

Liar because she was already lying to OP and the while attempt to open the relationship (pretty common it seems in situations like this) was so she didn’t have to keep hiding it. 

**She wants to get her rocks off but keep OP at home** in case she gets bored or it doesn’t work out. .  She’s a horrible and selfish human being.

She’s a cheater u/arandomusername420. Dump her.  She’s selfish and wants her cake and to eat it too. 

Cheating is cheating. It’s just more fun to do when she has you at home to come back to. That way her other partner is just fun, with no responsibilities. 

Also lost open relationships are about sleeping with other people not having a full blown relationship with them. 

That’s what she’s having and **that person is more important to her than you are OP**. Because she’s willing to sacrifice you for her. As you can see. . 

She has to go.  Respect yourself a bit. I mean. She’s literally already seeing someone else bro.  Go no contact.  Screw what she wants.  She doesn’t get to decide and keep you miserable and around while she gets best of both worlds."

Was the daughter in law likely took advantage of that. What a terrible human being.  Scumbag.
