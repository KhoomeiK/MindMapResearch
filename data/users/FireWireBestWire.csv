I can't tell you how many policies come down from above that are frankly just indecent, cruel, and plain insensitive. Small effort on our company's part to solve problems for customers that will easily become big for them. They simply don't have the equipment to deal with their problem themselves, and with 5-10 min of effort on our part we can solve their issue, but the management wants anything extra at all to be charged out with photos to prove, names of people who approved the extra, etc. We've lost a good number of customers in the last year because they get pissed off from this type of treatment.

Given the short memory of the American electorate, it will be better for swing state politics for the Republicans to do a sham trial and for that to be blatantly obvious.

I agree with your points why he's a better person for the job, but I also know the American political reality because I've been down this road before. Hope and Change in 2008 turned into more of the same, so the possibility of accomplishing what Bernie's saying is very slim. Furthermore, America is facing a general economic moment of reckoning regardless of government or corporate intervention: the money has already been spent and borrowed. There will be no preparation whatsoever (because it is a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy) when the dollar ceases to be the world's reserve currency. I believe that other world powers are currently trying to soften the blow of this reality because they know how angrily America will react to this change to their fundamentals.

Democrats can complain about the electoral college all they want, but that's the system that we have, and other Democratic candidates have won using that system. They usually win with effective appeals to working class voters, and that message wasn't clear enough from Hillary for those voters to be swayed.
