WHY DO THEY DO THIS?! I was in the hosipital just about 2 years ago because my gallbladder suddenly died. The nurses kept trying to get me to take a laxative and I wouldn't. One of them even had the gall to tell me that she even pooped regularly when she was very pregnant, so there was no reason I shouldn't be pooping once a day.

By the time I'd gotten to the hospital, I had evacuated my entite digestive tract from both ends 2 days before and couldn't keep anything down except for maybe 2 crackers. And then they gave me one small cup of jello when my blood sugar was very low (after I told them I was hypoglycemic... That was another trip because first they tried to give me insulin.) And the nurse was still surprised I hadn't pooped. LIKE POOP WHAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT."

And if it this difficult for me, without any lind of underlying familial predisposition, I could absolutely understand a situation where OP has ooone too many.factors to always stay 100% on top of it.

I'm a very tiny person (4'10"") and I gain weight at 1300 calories per day. That's an insanely small amount of food, and it means losses take MONTHS to see any progress, while a YEARS worth of progress can be entirely undone in literally two weeks worth of backslide. My job is sedentary and my relaxation pursuits are also sedentary. I have hypoglycemia, which means that I need to maintain a certain minimum blood sugar level or else I get migraines and then vomit. I also have depression. If I am in high stress situations, it is impossible for me to lose weight. I also have depression. My metabolism has shifted a great deal from when I was a teenager. All of this contributes to the difficulty I personally have losing weight. And none of those are any kind of genetic factor.

I just think that if someone is saying they are taking steps to become healthier and have in the past, they probably understand the specifics of their own body enough to know whether they fit into the ""most"" categorization or not."

AskReddit,ffkez1v,t1_ffkbq27,1580021662.0,"In my experience this question becomes difficult to answer because of the weird power play happening in some interviews.

For example, as everyone in this thread suggests to do, I once spun a negative into a positive and the interviewer flat out told me ""well, that isn't really a weakness then, is it."" Where does that leave me?

I have depression. All of the side effects are my biggest weakness. But that is literally something they aren't allowed to not hire me for (in the US at least), so it really invalidates the question entirely. Plus, I'm terrible at lying or tellingg half-truths. I feel disingenuous, and it comes out in my tone and body language. But I literally cannot tell them I have depression in the interview. I'm high functioning. I've never been hospitalized or suicidal. 99% of the time no one around me is ever going to know. But it changes my behavior and channels it into beating myself up for not being perfect. Striving to be the best cog in thw machine isn't actually detrimental to a company. Byt the negative stigma of depression supercedes this.

Honestly, this question should be struck from the record along with ""do you have kids?"" And ""are you married?"" - both of which are questions they are not allowed to ask you because it violates certain anti-discrimination laws. It's just not as open ended as ""what's your biggest weakness?"""
