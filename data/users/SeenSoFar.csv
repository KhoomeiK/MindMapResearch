I live and work in Africa and haven't ever faced racial prejudice from Africans, but I have from people who come to do work on the continent. I had one white American person say that I was committing rape by being married to my wife, being a citizen of Uganda, and speaking Luganda. Their reasoning? A black woman can never consent to a relationship with a white man so I was coercing her by the very nature of the colour of my skin. Also I was appropriating Ugandan culture by daring to be a citizen of the country and speaking the language, because a white person can never take part in the culture of a foreign country without disrespect, and that's the same as rape. Some people will go to incredible lengths to justify their own prejudices and turn them into a way to be superior to others."

Seizures and other excitotoxic neurological effects are what is dangerous for most cases of alcohol withdrawal. Any drug that is active on the GABAergic system has severe rebound effects when halted suddenly. The brain had developed a new normal equilibrium that tries to account for and somewhat counteract the constant presence of inhibitory signaling. When the inhibitory agent is then removed suddenly without proper care and preparation the brain goes too far in the other direction, with excitatory signaling predominating. An exceedingly excitatory state is profoundly deleterious and leads to seizures and neuron death from apoptosis.

AskReddit,ff576ve,t1_ff3wngi,1579582211.0,"I also had a very vivid exploration dream. It's easily the most vivid dream I've ever had.

So first I'm sitting in some kind of briefing, it's clearly the late 1960s or early 1970s based on my surroundings, the clothing people are wearing and stuff, but it's not our world exactly. There is a flag hanging on a wall and it's some weird amalgamation of Canadian, US, UK, and Mexican flags. There are military guys all around. A friend is there, but we don't know each other. There is a projector being lowered at the moment I become aware of my surroundings, and someone is about to give a briefing. My friend and I are both wearing uniforms but for different agencies. He's dressed as an officer, probably airborne or air force cause he has wings on. I'm wearing some kind of battle dress, like a SEAL or JTF2 or something. The guy giving the briefing is intelligence, but some agency I've never heard of. He begins his briefing.

He's talking about a secret city that's been built in North Vietnam. Instead of building up they've built down. The city is a series of concentric rings that descend down over 1km into the earth. The surface is covered by a dome and trees. Some new satellite technology has allowed it to be imaged. It looks kinda like [this image](https://i.imgur.com/iLgBXA9.jpg), terraced layers descending down in a cone shape.

He says they have been hearing chatter for the last 5 years about the Union City, but they've always believed it to be some kind of code and not referring to a real place due to the level of technology described as existing in this place. There's talk that the Sino-Soviet Union has overrun the NVA and taken control of North Vietnam's government, and they're up to something big. I'm being sent in to determine what the fuck is going on. The next second I'm stepping into some kind of machine and I see the ground rushing up to meet me, I'm inside the city, and I've just materialised out of nowhere in front of a lot of people, but they don't think this is anything unusual. They are speaking every known language and there are non-human beings among them.

I'm confused, this is not a communist military project, it's some ultra high tech city that doesn't belong in this location. I'm disturbed, people are speaking English, French, Russian, Chinese, and a multitude of languages I can't recognise. Something is wrong, none of this makes any sense. I try to move but I'm frozen in place. Something approaches me, they're humanoid but not human by a long shot. They tell me that they're sorry to have disabled my voluntary muscle control but they couldn't have me going off with my machine gun until they had time to explain. The North Vietnamese made a deal with the Sino-Soviet Union and allowed part of their country to be used for dangerous experiments in exchange for military aid fighting the capitalists in the South. An experiment was conducted which ripped open some kind of portal through spacetime. The area it connected to was ultra-advanced and had achieved world peace. Normally they had a policy of non-interference in interdimensional affairs but this time they had no choice. The Russian-Chinese technology was dangerous and risked destabilising the multiverse, potentially causing a complete failure of reality that would cascade and affect every locally adjacent reality. They decided that they had to help us find peace, so they side-shifted one of their minor cities into our reality to act as a base of operations. They were currently infiltrating every level of government in the communist states and were soon to move onto the Anglo-North American Federation. Our people would be given the most advanced technology and shown the way towards peaceful co-existence and post-scarcity society. I would not be allowed to leave as I could compromise this goal. I told them it wasn't necessary, I wanted to stay and help them, their goal was laudable and I fully agreed with it.

I begin to outline all the intelligence the Anglo-North American Federation has on Union City. They're surprised that we could visualise it on satellite but they'll correct the problem. They also sent a jolt of energy back along the path I came by to destroy the space-time folding tech I had been sent to the city with and make the people who sent me think I was dead.  They then led me on a tour of the city and introduced me to aliens and technology that was so far beyond us it made us look stone age. They then said they needed to be sure about my motives before they gave me free run of the city so they were going to read my mind out. They fitted me with a brain-computer interface and told me to relax. They plugged me into the computer and I saw a huge flash of light and then woke up."

AskReddit,fewmv2a,t1_few2gbz,1579415085.0,"There are lots of voodoo traditions that have positive purposes. Many of them are supposed to be wards against evil and those who intend to harm you. People consider voodoo to be dark due to the seemingly strange rituals, but people who practice if often take comfort in it.

That being said I have a strange experience related to this topic that I cannot explain. For some context I'm a physician who lives and works in Africa. I'm a rational person and I don't go in for supernatural explanations and magical thinking. I was working in Benin, a West African country which is the original home of the beliefs and practices that were exported to the Americas with slaves and eventually became what most people think of as voodoo. Vodun is the original name, and it's still very widely practiced in Benin.

I was working in a village in a pretty rural area, and was the only white person in the area. The people were still very much practitioners of the traditional beliefs. While I was there stuff started to go missing from people's homes. I'm talking money and valuables, in a place where the people have little of either. I was nervous because I'm a visitor in this community and I'm worried blame will fall on me, but no one ever even suggests that. Eventually someone catches the individual in the act, but they get away. They recognised him before he got away though, he was the son of a powerful man in another village.

The villagers contact the responsible party and tell him they just want the money back, which he refuses. They contact his father, who denies his son would ever do such a thing and accuses them of attempted extortion. They contact the police, who don't do anything because of corruption. More stuff goes missing, and thefts start in other surrounding villages as well. Finally they turn to a man in the village. He's what you would think of if someone said the word ""witchdoctor.""   A local expert in Vodun. He says he will solve the problem permanently.

He does some kind of ceremony in private, and nothing obvious happens. I'm completely dismissing that anything will happen at all, and feeling sorry for the villagers who will never get their things back. Then the next day comes and soon we get some news. The thief has been found dead in his home, with no marks on him. His eyes are wide with fear. On top of him and surrounding him is all the stolen money and property. It was a really strange event. Since his father was an important person they had detailed pathology work done in Nigeria, but a cause of death could not be identified.

Ephesians 2:8-10

For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

Romans 4:4-5

Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness

Galatians 2:16

Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified

Romans 11:6 

But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.

Romans 3:20-22

For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction

Of course there are plenty of verses which contradict this as well. Contradiction is pretty prevalent in the Bible. The teachings I've always heard from Christians of every stripe though is that works don't mean anything and that faith in Jesus is the only way to heaven. This is because man is tainted by sin and so are all his works."

news,fdm99oo,t1_fdm3lzz,1578542997.0,"That is most certainly not what I said. I said exactly the opposite. I said very clearly that an uncontained engine failure could result in a crash. I said I cannot think of anything that would result in a 737-NG immediately incinerating itself and falling like a stone from the sky after an engine failure. Is there some perfect storm incident that could make that happen? Probably? Is that at all probable, especially on an aircraft of that age? Not bloody likely. Now I'm a physician, not an aerospace engineer, so I can't claim to see any assembly lines out my window. I do however employ a variety of aircraft mechanics certified to maintain the aircraft under discussion and make it a point of knowing about my equipment. I've been informed that that the turbofans on these aircraft are specifically designed to prevent such incidents.

I seem to have misunderstood your point though. You seem to be saying that there is some infinitesimal chance of such a thing occurring. I agree with that. It does not seem like the likely course of events here, but certainly anything is possible when you're dealing with 10s of thousands of horsepower and high pressures like those found in a turbofan of that size."
news,fdlxgz5,t1_fdki6pa,1578534833.0,"As has been repeatedly pointed out to you, the design of the aircraft is such that this scenario doesn't fit a mechanical failure. The aircraft is certified for 180 minutes of single engine operation (ETOPS-180), the design is such that an uncontained engine failure will not lead to the aircraft exploding and plummeting from the sky due to the lack of combustible parts surrounding the turbofan. The aircraft is designed to be able to land safely after an engine violently disintegrates (such as in a series of events similar to those that led to the crash of [LOT Polish Airlines Flight 7 in 1980](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOT_Polish_Airlines_Flight_7)). Even in the event that a disintegrating engine punctures the pressurised portions of the fuselage the 737-NG is designed to be able to make an emergency landing. See the incident with [Southwest Airlines Flight 1380](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1380) for an example of this. 

A series of events beginning with an uncontained engine failure and ending with the eventual *crash* of a similar aircraft are within the realm of imagination. A series of events beginning with an uncontained engine failure and following with the loss of controlled flight of the aircraft and ending with the immediate and violent conflagration of the aircraft as it plummets from the sky like a stone are not within the realm of imagination."
news,fdlum12,t1_fdlekb4,1578532869.0,"If irrefutable evidence comes out that this incident was a shoot-down, the Government of Iran will likely blame a false flag operation or a rogue missile operator acting without authorization. They will probably do anything to not take accountability for the event. It will cost them any sort of good will they've accrued by appearing as the injured party defending themselves after the Soleimani killing. 

Right now people are kinda divided on how they feel about this whole thing. Some siding with Iran and arguing that Iran's retaliation the against US targets in Iraq was justified. Some people are siding with the US and saying that Iran deserved what they got. If it comes out that they shot down an airliner either through incompetence or misdirected malice anyone taking their side will immediately desert them. They'll do anything to prevent that."
