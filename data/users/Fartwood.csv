gifs,fe3i7d5,t1_fe2xg28,1578849471.0,"Cities. The rural areas of a “good” state are much the same as the rural areas of a “bad” one. Same for urban areas. If your picture of the US comes from TV and other media, your images are almost entirely based on state capitals. 

For an example, look up a map of the 2016 election results by county. In general, darker blue equals more urban and populous while darker red means the opposite."
mildlyinteresting,fe2elzw,t1_fe0ou4v,1578837527.0,"Fancy places frequented by the pompous assholes responding to you. 

They had one of these at my sister’s wedding except i think it was just lemons. My uncle walked up to me at one point, set his cup down, and whispered “man, that lemonade sucks ass”

Edit: Yeah. Keep downvoting for pointing out that saying the condescending shit in the other comments makes you a pompous asshole. That’ll make me wrong."
funny,fdxfcn8,t1_fdviv7v,1578768157.0,"On the flip side: When it’s time to hand out money, it goes to raises for obnoxious shitweasels like Bari Weiss and Brett Stephens. When it’s time to cut back, the cuts are made to people that actually matter. Editors, journalists, underpaid and overworked freelancers. 

Obviously it would be harder for them to survive if everyone stole content though. I’m not really advocating one way or the other. I’m just saying it’s easy not to think about when something is supported by advertising. When they come around asking for your patronage, I picture the overpaid assholes they have crying and snitch-tagging on Twitter."

Showerthoughts,fdqmq2k,t1_fdqlgwp,1578670326.0,"It’s just the games you play. Shitty games aimed at children have an X that appears somewhere between the beginning of the add and 30 seconds in, and it can be anywhere on the margins of the screen. Can be different colors or sizes to make it blend in or harder to click. Some will do anything to trick you into thinking you’re playing a mini game (a real type of ad, but not in this case) and instead redirect you to the store upon clicking."

Showerthoughts,fdnbu57,t1_fdmn4yn,1578582412.0,"Yeah but what about when that kid remembers you?

What about when all of those kids remember you?

What about if I practice my poker face for when people call out to me and I don’t recognize them and I practice talking to them without using their name but the second or third thing they say is always “You don’t remember me, do you?”

Am I a bad person yet?

Edit: “We were in little league together, remember?”

Dude, I don’t remember a single coach, parent, child, or team. 

“We were in band together”

Holy shit. I played clarinet for six months a decade and a half ago. I didn’t even remember that. How did you?"
CasualConversation,fdn2jxw,t1_fdn0ura,1578575376.0,"Yeah, that is an option workplaces are allowed to do, but only because the unmarried partner is still a dependent. The same way workplaces can optionally let you cover your kids after age 26. Your ex-spouse is supposed to be removed because they’re no longer your dependent"
CasualConversation,fdmzwvr,t1_fdms369,1578572868.0,Serious question: Was he allowed to keep you on if he wanted? In America you’re supposed to remove your spouse immediately after the divorce is finalized. Since you can only have dependents on your insurance and they are no longer a dependent.
LifeProTips,fdlz9oc,t3_elz4g4,1578536056.0,Why are there so many shitty jokes here? It’s bad.
u_getnexar,fdlxlu8,t3_eiwc4j,1578534924.0,"Not funny, didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've wasted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt.

“This won’t be another Tridam,” Geralt said with an effort.

One image from that video that regularly comes back to me is the guy at 17:40

memeframe,fdcgia0,t1_fdca1dv,1578274328.0,"You get the same amount of affinity no matter who kills it. Only difference is it’s divided equally among your gear instead of being either all frame or frame/weapon split. 

(Edit: assuming that you’re within affinity range. But if you’re far enough away to not get any, no sense in complaining about not getting kills)

And that’s the issue with bubbles on Hydron. If I’m on hydron, I’m grinding affinity. Any frame that clears the map is my friend because they’re funneling affinity into me. Any frame that slows the pace down is making the grind last longer."
UpliftingNews,fd5i5bc,t1_fd4jt2f,1578177915.0,"When I had my first kid, I was allowed to leave and get my full pay for that day, and told that i could take one extra day off unpaid if I wanted. 

For my second kid, at a different job, I got two weeks paid. And by “two weeks paid” I mean that I had FMLA  and they allowed me to use my two weeks vacation for the year all at once after the birth. Then I had to come back because we couldn’t afford any more time. So I had to leave my son who was born 6 weeks early and my wife who had was recovering from an emergency c section, bladder surgery, and a partial hysterectomy. Neither one had left the hospital yet. 

This isn’t any sort of complaint at you or an “I had it tough” pissing contest. It just seemed on topic and I wanted to vent."

But if you make an equal trade (or a trade where the other person incorrectly thinks they got ahead. Like boardwalk for a railroad or a yellow) it gives you a leg up over whoever you didn’t trade with."
personalfinance,fcih4qu,t1_fciea7j,1577662456.0,"And you are correct. There just seems to be a miscommunication between you and everyone answering you. Maybe no one is clear on the question.

Even now, I’m not sure if you’re just rhetorically asking to say “it’s a useless service” or seriously asking what the next step is. So I’ll try to answer both

If you’re saying it’s useless and stupid: Correct. It’s not a service for people who have their head on straight financially and are thinking clearly. Lots of seemingly normal people make bad decisions. If you live somewhere that payday loans are legal, you would be *shocked* at how many everyday people are locked in  a payday loan cycle

If you’re seriously asking “You’re running a deficit, this gives you a boost, then it catches up. What is your next step?”: Lots of things. Credit cards. Loans. Pawn shops. Selling things (that you  probably couldn’t actually afford at the time and may even still be making payments on). Borrowing money from friends and relatives. Letting one payment go late so that you can pay a different one right now. It’s a constant juggling act and this service is just one more ball in the air. 

My ex wife is like that. Constantly juggling different debts. It’s insane to look over the debts I took over and see how much we paid on interest, late fees, and overdrafts compared to how much we actually paid on principals."

harborfreight,fcao4qt,t3_egxdd8,1577573147.0,"Never ordered anything online from them so take this with a grain of salt

-people have told me before that they got the store to order stuff for them, but it wasn’t an order *for* them. It was the store ordering an item for inventory and letting them come in and buy it. So, maybe if you talked to a manager or the right cashier they could do that. Maybe not

-You can use coupons when ordering online

-more important than either of those: Central Machinery stuff is currently excluded from the percent off coupons. It doesn’t seem to be on the physical coupon, but it is coded into the system. So you won’t be able to use that one online and they would likely not allow you to use it in store. But they might.

Edit: Didn’t look at the actual price until now. I have no idea what the margin on that is, but I wouldn’t expect them to to take $140 off for the coupon unless they already had one and we’re looking to get it out of there"

This is really dorky. I tried really hard to get a good selfie, something I never do. I thought “You know, you do look alright. You’re handsome when you smile”. So now I make an effort to take one good picture of myself every day, to smile when I can remember to, and to look in the mirror and think something positive about myself. “You look good”, “you’re a good guy”, “you try hard”, etc. 

It’s just baby steps, and I haven’t been doing it long, but it has made a noticeable improvement to my average mood and self-esteem."

tl;dr: likely that the pilot deliberately turned off anything that could track him, killed all the passengers via decompression, then flew into the ocean along a suicidal path he had practiced at home on his flight simulator. From the few bits of data we actually do have, they have a pretty rough idea of where the plane went down. All the fragments have since been carried far away from there by ocean currents."
