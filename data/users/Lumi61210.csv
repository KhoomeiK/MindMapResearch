aww,ffmrydy,t3_eu2cgn,1580058305.0,"No way this horse is only being fed weekly and some horses HATE being blanketed. Bedding for a shelter has to be changed regularly or you can get all kinds of bacteria and mold - you can't just throw hay (as someone had suggested, since it's food) or straw in there. Lots of factors at play in horse keeping. As long as he doesn't have wounds, is happy and alert when you see him and has food and water - that's likely enough for your local animal control organization. Maybe talk to the owner and see if the child can help out and start learning more about horses and their care? Would be beneficial all around from the sounds of it."
Aquariums,ffmnydr,t3_eu08nn,1580057119.0,I've watched mine crawl up the glass to the surface and lean backwards until they are suspended on the water like this. It seems to be somewhat fun based on the number of times I catch them like this.
MorbidReality,ffmi9pw,t1_ffmcl0v,1580055076.0,"Dental eruption just means when the tooth breaks through the gumline, like when the adult teeth come in - not explosive."
MadeMeSmile,fficpen,t3_etrjgy,1579970740.0,I do not know these people and I am so proud of both of them. Got me all teared up.
Aquariums,fezzeyn,t1_fezhozq,1579463521.0,Still fine probably. Just wash with soap.
Aquariums,fezfwls,t3_eqnjzl,1579456892.0,Is there anything alive in there?
Aquariums,fezflku,t3_eqo6vy,1579456843.0,"If it explodes it's probably a geode, so that's cool if you survive!"
Aquariums,fezf77s,t3_eqqwl5,1579456713.0,Just wash with soap and you'll be fine. Cycled aquarium water is not something you wanna drink but it isn't like horrifically toxic. Basically lake water.
Aquariums,fezehv3,t3_eqt8n1,1579456522.0,Lots of folks hate snails but I find them really cute and they keep things tidy. Just a thought though.
Aquariums,feze9ca,t3_eqtvpz,1579456466.0,"Try a sand substrate. It's really cool actually. I have one sand, one rock, and one Fluval Stratum. Sand is by far my favorite for maintenance."
Aquariums,fezduna,t1_fex8qz0,1579456322.0,You can make some really cool snail and shrimp tanks with the small setups but it takes a lot of cycle time and testing. The smaller the tank the less margin for error.
Aquariums,fezd8m3,t3_eqwl0c,1579456131.0,My oto wouldn't eat algae from the tank if you paid him. He's spoiled on cichlid pellets.
Aquariums,fezcgzk,t3_eqxztr,1579455944.0,If you're not overfiltering you are gonna have a bad time. They STINK.
Aquariums,fezc32e,t3_eqnu1u,1579455820.0,That would be an odd pattern for a nerite.
Aquariums,fezbydr,t3_eqsxs3,1579455774.0,I had tons of these in my childhood tank. If you get more they will breed like mad so be prepared
Aquariums,fezbijq,t3_eqxbeg,1579455714.0,Give them a fasting day. They won't die. Then scale back your feeding a bit. They can get chonky but it makes them slow and more likely to get picked on. Kinda like people.
Aquariums,fez9znp,t3_eqkdl8,1579455186.0,You. You is good people.
Aquariums,fez9w92,t3_eqv6pw,1579455154.0,This is fucking impressive for a first timer. I'm excited to see what your future holds in the hobby.
videos,fez93ex,t1_fewzdia,1579454988.0,Bettas native habitats are pretty shallow. Betta will likely eat the shit out of those shrimp before they get any chance at wounding him.
videos,fez8saa,t1_feu2qz5,1579454901.0,So the thing about crabs...is that they are not good aquarium pets. They need dry land and water to really thrive. Most folks don't have paludarium setups at the ready and they require a fair amount of expertise and money to build. I had one little fiddler crab as a kid that escaped the tank all the time and terrified me. Now as an adult I just feel bad my parents bought him.
videos,fez7xg4,t1_fewzj3e,1579454617.0,Aquarium people are the best at answering questions imho
videos,fez7kz4,t1_fetygvm,1579454508.0,"If you get fish that don't have flowing fins like theirs and fish who stay closer to the bottom they tend to be ok. Bettas are heavy on personality though so while one betta may be a pacifist to a certain tank, another could lead a massacre. Those cherry shrimp are fucked though, I can tell you that much right now."
videos,fez6qto,t1_fex6qw8,1579454373.0,Aquaria is both the single most calming and tediously stressful (at times) hobby.  Much science. Much drama. Much joy. Do recommend.
Aquariums,fez3fze,t3_eqjucy,1579453527.0,Mine just ate their first clutch. Hoping for another soon.
funny,fesmfi6,t1_fesjo4b,1579366778.0,Hmm fine. Let me reword that - flail induced momentum
funny,fesiexv,t1_fes91wt,1579365499.0,"You're actually pretty capable of whacking your head hard enough to die, especially if you have much speed. It takes way less than you'd think to suffer a brain injury or die."
todayilearned,fesho01,t1_fesh7pg,1579365258.0,Im still stateside and the only Finnish language I've seen taught here was by the Mormons in the Mission Training Center - so that's a no go for me. I've listened to a ton of music and watched as many Finnish speakers as I can find but damn it is a complicated language.

offmychest,fenbr4q,t1_femlpbf,1579281288.0,"So what's your alternative? You do have to make a choice to get better - whether that be making an effort to enjoy what you do have or go to therapy or get medication or start a meditation and self love practice or  all of the above. Mental health problems aren't your fault, but it is your responsibility and your burden to do better. I've been there myself, and the only way it got better was me finally saying enough was enough and putting in the effort to readjust my brain chemistry and my perspective."
offmychest,felm9e0,t1_fekuqv0,1579225553.0,"It's not about having a positive outlook about everything, it is about making an effort to find the good in SOMEthing. Everything can fucking suck right now but kittens are great. Food is nice. I do love me some blankets. My water isn't making me die of dysentery. The moon is always up there, keeping shit cyclical and being humanity's nightlight- that's cool. These things are rad. Taking those little baby steps and appreciating and savoring the objectively wonderful things, even if there aren't that many of them will slowly start making the world less bleak. I have battled depression and some shit circumstances all of my life, and I used to resent the ""find the good people"" but l get it now. It takes effort but it's such a pure effort and you get to own that as your little victory against the bad."
offmychest,fell1kw,t1_fel07qe,1579224724.0,"There is unrest but there has always been unrest. It's ignorant to think things are the worst they have ever been because we have this glory of hindsight that smooths out the rough spots in history. As long as there are humans there will be human shit to worry about. Some folks are luckier than others, this is true, but do they even know it? Their subjective experience is probably hard for them in different ways. Fuck, even if you were the only person on Earth - you could get obliterated by a meteor at any moment. Disease is around us and the makings of it are inside of us literally every moment we live. That said, it is an astounding miracle of sheer luck and innovation and a million tiny catastrophes and victories over the seemingly impossible that you are even here to think shit is hard (and type it on a tiny wonder of ingenuity and then broadcast it to the other side of the fucking planet). Point is - You can live your life and do your best to make the best of it, hell maybe you can even fix some shit and not fuck other shit up on the way or you can be paralyzed with the unknown. It's a choice. You get one certainty and that is your presence in this moment, right now. Savor what you have."

movies,fda4ka3,t3_ek64wl,1578241559.0,This movie should have been great with the budget and cast it had but failed to make me care about a single member of the cast as well as having suffered some shit plot. We already had slow paced sullen hunky spaceman movie - First Man. We already had the spooky ship being found around Neptune with Event Horizon. We had parenting-is-super-hard-yo + space movie with Interstellar. Moon pirates were pretty much the only new thing here.

Lazy, food picky, generally kinda shit attitude to everyone except their one chosen person (who they will happily die/kill to please). My parents have had them all of my life.
