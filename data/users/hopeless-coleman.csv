So i have Autism, ADHD and severe social and normal anxiety partially because of my autism and having my phone is the only way i won’t have a panic attack when i’m at school because that means i can always message or call my mum or dad when i’m in need, And it’s not always about messaging my parents it’s also about maybe going out on reddit to see a cute dog to calm me down so that my anxiety, ADHD or autism won’t spiral out of control. 

i’ve struggled quite a lot getting the teachers to understand that i need my phone and that i can’t give it away because it would seriously mess me up so i can’t never support these 0 tolerance policies regarding phones.
