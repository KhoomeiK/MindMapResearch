There's a change in procedure and the lawyers require a note in the paperwork that says staves were instructed.  There's a problem office that needs to be addressed and rather than single them out, everyone gets the scolding.  Someone figured out how to steal another benefit from the peons, or wants to force them into a bullshit ""retirement"" scheme.  And so on.

Those who have been at the bottom for a while know that actually pointing out problems is a great way to stay exactly where they are forever, or get fired.  So invariably you'll see the smartest and most experienced of them saying absolutely nothing.  You will also see that bosses are well aware of this, and a frequent trick is to force those otherwise silent people into the mix by giving them lines to deliver in the meetings.  Their lack of enthusiasm is always apparent.

Then there are the preeners, peacocks, social climbers and manipulators who rely entirely upon these meetings for their own status and mobility.

Showerthoughts,ff94jtl,t3_esaku4,1579704675.0,"Oh, no.  As a cartoon aficionado I can tell you exactly how it went.  When cartoons were shown before feature films they were drawn at 12-24 frames per second by a really good artist/director with a large team of ""in-betweeners"" who would draw between the lead artist's keyframes.  The good Tom and Jerries and the good Bugs Bunnies come from this era, ca. 1938-1959.

Then, starting in the '60s, cartoons became the province of television.  They skimped on everything, from less lavish backgrounds to fewer keyframes to fewer inbetweeners to fewer FPS.  Despite Johnny Quest, Hannah-Barberra was at the fore of this artistic nosedive.  Greats like Chuck Jones were brought in to lend some cred, but it didn't work.

So for example, compare this golden-age [Warner Brothers penguin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43-YeL7Ja4g) to 1963's [Tennessee Tuxedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxUaadrxuDk), which was absolute garbage, artistically.

I and hundreds of other kids descended upon this million-dollar home in Langley and proceeded to throw down.

The scene is worth describing.  Frankie Goes to Hollywood was blaring through a thousand-dollar speaker system and there were blue lights shining into this two-story tall open area with giant windows.  Looked like it was directed by Michael Mann.  The liquor cabinet was seized upon and there's bottles of hundred-year old brandy being paraded through the crowd.

I was up above and watching all this, sipping cognac or some shit with my pals, when one of my friends pointed out a couple.  First date written all over them.

The guy was dressed to the 80's nines, with these snow white pants that had these superfluous snaps that ran right down the centerline of each leg with a red lining and a white jacket with a pink Izod, collar turned up, of course.  Real Brad sort of material.

The girl on the other hand was probably beautiful but was just totally doing the Madonna thing with all the war paint and a single frilly glove.  And a blue dress.  Her body language was suggesting that she was not at all happy to be with this dude.

The dude, on the other hand, is being a perfect gentleman in a situation that's quickly spiraling out of control.  But while he's trying to lead her outside, she had got hold of a bottle of something and was slugging it every time his head was turned.

Anyway, there were a million other hilarious things happening and within minutes the police arrived and completely blocked the half-mile long gravel road that led to the house. They cleared everyone out into the yard where there was an impromptu bonfire of trash, beer cases, nearby firewood, and pool furniture.  The police were clearly at a loss as to what to do with hundreds of wasted teens, all of whom had driven there.

While me and the boys plotted our escape (successful--we were too smart to park on that road and instead came through the woods from another subdivision), I noticed that same couple across the bonfire from me.  Now the girl is wasted and jetting up faster than almost anyone I'd ever seen.  One second she's passing out, then she drops to her knees and tries to blow this guy.

Then, suddenly, she stands up and shudders, and the dude puts an arm around her to comfort her, and she barfs a melon-colored Exorcist stream all over this dude's white suit, top to bottom.  And the police were closing in on the bonfire as we backed into the brush."

And Obi-wan pretty much cornered the market.  For most of the 1950s Alec Guinness was the king of the small crime drama.  (Examples: The Lavender Hill Mob, The Ladykillers.  Guinness was increasingly being pushed into bad-guy roles because British actors who actually served in the war like Trevor Howard could never forgive Guiness for being an objector.)

&#x200B;

The trend continued all the way until the admirably tight Shallow Grave (1994).  That one was Peter Boyle's directorial debut and features Obi-wan (Ewan McGregor) and the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston).

&#x200B;

There's a pretty cool tie-in to a subsequent film, Trainspotting.  The same drug-dealer (or at least the same actor playing a drug dealer) plays a prominent role in both."

Once I was bringing a guards red 911 Cabriolet through Baltimore, and up on the overpass I dropped the hammer.  I know it was the fastest I'd ever gone, certainly over 130 but I didn't dare look down.  I crested the top of the overpass and some combination of open top, high wind, and high speed made the car start to float like a hovercraft, slowly drifting toward one side.  I figured if I touched the brakes I was going to fly over three or four blocks before I augered in somewhere a hundred feet below.  But I kept my composure, some, and kept it on the road.

Her job was to run against the herd when Republicans didn't care and were going to lose the vote anyway, so she could stay on the bubble as one of the ""mavericks.""  If it was the least bit important, she was the most dependable party line voter there was.

It was that simple, and she has been exactly that predictable for over 20 years.   Her entire career has been fake-caring for losing issues.  Now she's pinned down to something important and, surprise surprise, she went with the traitors.  If you review her entire record, you'll see that when they needed her vote to win, that's what she did, every single time.

&#x200B;

Edit: It was a useful tool.  When Susan Collins took a stand on something, say to cross party lines, it meant the Whip had decided that the vote couldn't be won.

You're annoyingly wrong and I can't allow you to fuck up someone's computer building experimentation.  The active cooling cools the part that needs to be actively cooled, and it still does that here, and if there are other parts that rely on a case for active cooling, they're shit parts that you never wanted.  The fact that there is no case to trap any waste heat here means that the entire system trends toward ambient *far* faster than most cases.

What you want to do is look for the unicorn onesie on Amazon without logging in.  The one you want is usually described as ""fleece"" or ""high quality fleece.""  It has pockets and a zipping back (remember to hold onto the tail at festies).  Once you're familiar with the catch phrases, keep looking at similar ones from different makers until the 12.99 ones with free shipping start turning up.  

If you're a medium they're as cheap as eight bucks.  I'm gonna get one of those because every girl I know who comes over wants to put one of these things on.  It's very cool.

It looks like they had two launches within 50 hours of each other in June, 2017 and have come close to that several more times since, but usually only with alternating Vandenberg and Cape launches.

AskReddit,fehah6o,t3_ep5v8a,1579112531.0,"I like Virginia and West Virginia.  They'd ideologically split almost county-by-county in the secession convention of 1861.  But West Virginia is remarkable in its creation because of how little it tried to overreach in the middle of a bitter civil war.  It was a very real and very political split and West Virginians wanted nothing to do with old Virginia--a secession within a secession that led to a permanent split.

There are a few nods to the military realities of 1863, notably Highland County remaining in Confederate (Virginia) possession.

The particular reason for that was that over the course of maybe two weeks in May, 1862, two armies fought  a small battle (McDowell) and subsequently sparred through most of Highland and back.  In so doing the countryside was completely denuded, the roads destroyed, its 6000-person population dispersed, and the area remained effectively uninhabitable wilderness for years thereafter.  The burden of ownership was thought to be greater than its worth.  Even today it has one of the lowest population densities on the Atlantic Coast, a legacy of just a few hundred hours' combat.
