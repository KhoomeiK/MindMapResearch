MomForAMinute,ff3vcd1,t1_ff3ucn9,1579549655.0,"I’m sorry you are having such a hard time. And I’m sorry you have these medical issues. I don’t know why some of us have to deal with all this type of thing. It isn’t because we are lesser people or less deserving of our lives. After almost 25 years of such experiences, I can tell you that there is hope. I won’t say things come up sunshine and roses, but I think you will at some point feel an easing. But to get there, you have to keep going. Keep seeking help. Keep breathing."
MomForAMinute,ff3u01z,t1_ff3sp12,1579548818.0,I know you can’t feel it. You aren’t in that place yet. That’s why you need to look to your son. He can’t handle your leaving. He cannot. Promise yourself and him you’ll hang on while help comes. You know it’s coming because you are seeking it out.
MomForAMinute,ff3sf1n,t3_erhtiz,1579547842.0,"Dear one, you are so precious. You do not know how precious you are because you cannot feel that right now. That’s okay. I need you to hang in there. I know about places where you are beyond bone tired, where you have to make it through the next second because the next day is way too far. I’m very proud of you for seeking the help you need. It’s so important that you do. Look at your son, and let him fill up your heart and hear it beat. Then, the next heartbeat and the next. Breathe in and breathe out. Repeat. You’ve got this for now."
VintageFashion,ff36te0,t1_ff2fvox,1579535062.0,"Thank you. I’m glad to have dates because that doesn’t mesh with the family story, and I’d rather be accurate. I really think it’s a darling outfit. My girls were never interested in it, but maybe someday a grandchild will be :)"
VintageFashion,ff364ty,t1_ff2abjb,1579534595.0,Thank you. My search didn’t show that.
Fantasy,ff1go0t,t3_er3v19,1579478937.0,"I’ll tell you so you can flame on me. The Mists of Avalon. Things around this book are problematic (although I don’t think it extends to the book itself), but when I read it as a young person, it taught me how to see the other side of every story. That became one of my primary philosophies in life. And that viewpoint plays a part in everything I write. And for that I have to credit the book."
books,fewef6b,t3_eqqijp,1579409216.0,Horror is my go-to genre. I love when ghosts or supernatural beings are presented as characters and developed. Anna Dressed in Blood was a recent read in that area. And a good dark fairytale retelling is always welcome. Strands of Bronze and Gold I thought was especially well done.
books,fewdt9v,t1_few6n5q,1579408916.0,That sounds fun. I think I’ll put it on our family read together list. Thanks for the suggestion.
tipofmytongue,few7q5p,t1_few6ux2,1579406547.0,Sorry. Wish I could help.
tipofmytongue,few55l2,t3_eqqno2,1579405541.0,"Sounds like Sam’s Letters to Jennifer by James Patterson, but I don’t think that was made into a movie."
