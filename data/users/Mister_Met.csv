worldnews,ffh7512,t1_ffh6gz1,1579924991.0,"Very rich people generally don’t have income per se. They make their money off their investment holdings, which is taxed as capital gains (or not at all if there is no gain in the capital). So no, they don’t have income and that’s how they avoid paying income taxes.

worldnews,ffh6rs8,t1_fffscd8,1579924687.0,"Bro, google the carried interest loophole. It’s absolutely a loophole that allows ultra rich people to pay much less taxes than they would if it were income. That’s why you need a wealth tax. Whether we ever get one is a matter of debate. It doesn’t look like Warren is going to get elected but even if she were, the senate is still firmly in republican control and probably many democrats would vote against a wealth tax anyway.

I actually don’t think high *earners* should be penalized. If you make a lot of money through income you should get to keep the lion’s share of it. That’s why I think you should institute a flat tax on all income above a certain amount (say 30k or whatnot. People making less than that shouldn’t pay anything. Or only like 10%) but have that income tax be significantly lower than what we have now. Then tack on a wealth tax on everybody with, like, 10 million in assets or more. The idea is you tax people who are just hoarding assets more than you do people who are earning money from income. I think that’s a lot fairer."

AskHistory,fff1ist,t3_et6fpi,1579873131.0,"Public opinion by the American colonies, at least as recently as 1775 or so, was that they were subjects of the British empire. Their complaints with the crown were that they weren’t being respected as Englishmen. They didn’t want to start their own country, at least initially. 

There’s been a lot of historic research on this. Well into the revolutionary war there were many pockets of loyalists, with New York being one such bastion. Also free blacks generally sided with the crown because they were told they would remain free under British rule. These are things that aren’t taught in american history classes.

British public opinion, from what I have read, was more along the lines of “those damn colonists should respect the crown and be grateful for the fact that they’re ruled by this glorious empire.” Which of course helped harden what would become American public opinion and eventually convinced a majority of colonists (or at least a majority of important colonists) that revolution was necessary."
worldnews,fff0z12,t1_ffeo8mc,1579872672.0,"I mean that comparison is not quite fair because we (most of us in the West at least) have it a hell of a lot better than any serf every could have dreamed of. I don’t think any kind of revolution is necessary. I think we just need to create better tax laws that greatly minimize if not eliminate the amount of loopholes that ultra rich people can exploit. If you have a tax on wealth (all assets held, even offshore) that will do something. Then you can counter that with a flat tax on income that is the same for everybody. Simple. Easy.
