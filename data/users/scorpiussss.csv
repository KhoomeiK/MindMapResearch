I'll admit that the kiss scene, the whole neck kiss one was really good though, hehe. 
But thank you that does explain a lot more!"
selfimprovement,ff5mpi4,t3_erfaax,1579600583.0,"Work and effort. No one will change the way you act but you, since the way you act and thing is the only think you're in full control of in this life. If you want change to come to you, you'll have to work for it."
ZenKoi,few15s6,t3_eq9s03,1579404001.0,I did :D my name is something stupid like fish are cool or something lol
DecidingToBeBetter,feet0b5,t1_feepgip,1579040572.0,"Absolutely. It's also good to understand that progress takes time. Progress really tests you in every aspect, and on top of all that, you need to be patient.  
Patience. One of the hardest things for someone who has to live in today's society. But it's so important.  
Working on yourself takes just that - work.   


A while back, I heard this quote in a video ""Most of the time, don't eat like an asshole. When you do eat like an asshole, don't treat yourself like an asshole."" I struggle with this so much. What's done, is done and you should just accept it, learn and move on."
DecidingToBeBetter,feeqmp3,t1_febnrvu,1579039142.0,"I'm not sure if this helps, but I definitely think we all have control of ourselves and our actions, and I think we hold the power in our hands to change ourselves if we'd like.  


From the bottom of my heart, I wish you the best, truly."
DecidingToBeBetter,feeprb8,t1_fee5r72,1579038639.0,Absolutely. You always need to be there for yourself.
DecidingToBeBetter,feepled,t1_fedybqh,1579038546.0,"In this world, no one except for your family has the obligation to take care of you. You need to learn on how to help yourself when nobody is around. That's the harsh truth. Humans are supposed to be social creatures, right? It's sad that people are so mean and vile that it truly comes to a point where you can't trust anyone anymore."
DecidingToBeBetter,feephgx,t1_fedwln2,1579038482.0,No problem :)
DecidingToBeBetter,feepgw8,t1_fedd9s2,1579038474.0,No problem :D

DecidingToBeBetter,feepf72,t1_fed2lj9,1579038445.0,Reminding yourself of this from time to time is extremely important! :)

DecidingToBeBetter,feepba5,t1_fecluqo,1579038383.0,No problem :)
DecidingToBeBetter,feep9fy,t1_fed2y73,1579038354.0,"Surviving teaches you a lot about living, for sure. It's difficult being alone, especially when you're in a society that considers you a failure if you don't have any friends. But you learn to take care of yourself."
DecidingToBeBetter,feep3f8,t1_fect2u0,1579038257.0,Always!
DecidingToBeBetter,feep2gq,t1_fecpe3t,1579038241.0,"I relate. It's difficult - I never fulfill my promises, when it comes to myself. I'm always so worried about others, and their well being, but I always fail myself.   
But, you need to fight against that. Nothing will change unless you work for it. It's so difficult but you feel yourself getting better."

DecidingToBeBetter,feeos00,t1_feca816,1579038073.0,"All we have for granted is first of all ourselves, and secondly our family. What I've learned recently is that friends will come and go."

DecidingToBeBetter,feeonv4,t1_febndq9,1579038006.0,No problem! Happy for you!
DecidingToBeBetter,feeomsy,t1_febgduy,1579037989.0,Agree completely :)
DecidingToBeBetter,feeolyd,t1_fecmr1b,1579037976.0,Interesting quote!
DecidingToBeBetter,feeokkm,t1_fecz6so,1579037953.0,"Thank you so much for sharing.  
I completely agree, especially with recognizing that you have a choice. You really do. I tend to forget that things don't have to be a certain way."
DecidingToBeBetter,feeoeei,t1_fec2hy1,1579037853.0,"Agreed. Of course, you always need to be able to criticize your own actions and recognize what you've done wrong, learn from it and move on. None of us are perfect, and all of us make mistakes but it's important to forgive ourselves sometimes."
DecidingToBeBetter,feeo8ph,t1_febkkso,1579037761.0,"I wish you the best of luck with your drinking habit. Dealing with something like that is difficult, however I believe each and everyone of us has the ability to change our future. Please try to remember that no one is stopping you from acting the way you want, as much as no one is stopping you from not drinking anymore - that's something that you need to work out yourself.   


Please do look for help, you deserve it because you're amazing, no matter what you tell yourself :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,feenzbc,t1_febcftg,1579037609.0,"No problem :) Love yourself and be there for yourself, because at the end of the day the only thing that will always remain yours is who you are as a person, your thoughts, and your actions."
DecidingToBeBetter,feenuuf,t1_febcc6u,1579037537.0,"Self talk and developing who I am, my skills, my personality, everything, has been a personal goal of mine for a while that I've been honestly avoiding for months. I decided that I cannot go on ignoring myself and my needs.  


One day at a time for sure! Always take it one day at a time. YOU'RE enough :)"
DecidingToBeBetter,feenny9,t1_feb76es,1579037425.0,No problem! <3 :)
DecidingToBeBetter,feenn5q,t1_febgks0,1579037413.0,"Very true. You don't control someone else's actions, that's an extremely important reminder for empaths.  
Today I ate so much sugar. My old reaction would've been a guilty one. Instead, I just tell myself ""you're in control of you, tomorrow is a new day and it'll bring new opportunities"". It really helps."

Journaling,fd01bnz,t3_ejjoil,1578112155.0,"That journal is so cute, omg!

A big tip is definitely watching journal flips to get inspired, it really helps you.
Also, don't worry too much about it. Journaling is there to help you, and it's something you can do on your own terms."

h3h3productions,fcvl470,t3_eiucli,1578004423.0,"They still talk very highly of him so I'm certain he'll come back again. But we've gotta remember that Post is a big artist at the moment, with a busy schedule, and Hila and Ethan are now parents, so it's probably difficult to find a time that works. But he'll for sure be back again, I don't think they'll fell off or anything."

Now, I hope she has a bunch of time off, to heal and to process. I feel like she's truly gonna flourish in the next era, because hopefully she's just now finishing up with healing.

(not that I want to rush her at all, but when do you guys think the next era will start?)"
