No funding towards stepping up enforcement on businesses. Nothing on Fox condemning them (like Trump, himself).


No, Republicans know how vital they are to our economy, not least by keeping our food prices low. It's all a bunch of fearmongering BS to rally the base of racists and ""law and order"" types around.

Because if the Republicans acquit him, that is what they are opening themselves up to.  If he really had corruption concerns with Biden he would have used the proper law enforcement channels of both countries to launch his investigation.  


Yes, the partisan vote tells me that a section of congress doesn't care about presidential corruption as long as their side is winning, as does McConnell's stance of not having a full trial.  And the transcript wasn't a complete transcript.  Not to mention the emails released yesterday further implicating Trump.  Sounds to me like you're the one being told what to think."
