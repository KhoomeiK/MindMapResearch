education,ffnzcjx,t1_ffnogtr,1580072587.0,"I believe this too about learning. Project based learning would probably be helpful to the kinds of problems that I'm imagining connected to the social climate. The social part I am talking about is definitely subjective. Based on the school and environment, rules, instruction, curriculum, the social experience will be different for every person. However, I think that the way a school is structured and the general culture have some kind of internal logic that deeply effects the social experience, and that is constantly changing because you have different people every year."

SeriousConversation,ffix7cv,t3_etvuzy,1579984912.0,It's hard to talk about death. People react oddly to it. That reaction could be fear or maybe surprise about where the conversation is coming from? Some people are kind of morbid.
SeriousConversation,ffiimxv,t3_etqikg,1579974766.0,Superiority in a person is distasteful. How is it helpful to anyone to remind people of he or she is superior? All it seems like is a poor justification to hoard all the resources and to take up time with ones bad opinions.

SeriousConversation,ffglqae,t1_ffep3tb,1579909157.0,"Here's a counter-example to the idea that someone that survives has strong traits. It could also be that everyone is weakened and some are weakened more than others, leaving some people alive. It only appears that a person that has made it through the process is more strong, but that doesn't make sense since everyone was weakened by the process."
science,fffxhj8,t3_etb9ln,1579893946.0,There is so much disagreement about education that you would expect lots of different ways about how to teach.
SeriousConversation,ffdbrk5,t3_eszq86,1579817492.0,Is it possible that it is survivor bias like the people who seem tough are the ones that have survived and they had some strong traits when they were young and the people who are gone had weaker traits and they have died off by now. The reason that some topics are more prevalent is because of networks and positive feedback loops. Something I've noticed is that a lot of older people that seem to be doing well exercise regularly. Maybe that is what is common between older people and not any kind of 'toughness' wisdom.
SeriousConversation,ffdaqjd,t3_esp981,1579816809.0,"I think asking questions in class and visiting your professors can help form relationships with those around you, maybe also showing up to class early, just so you get to know the people around you better and stand out some."

LateStageCapitalism,ffavyjo,t3_es0dyr,1579745750.0,"My feeling is that J K Rowling and Colin Kaepernick are on the side of Good. They are very successful yes and they are also making meaningful statements. For J K Rowling, she made a children's book that's basically inspiring, even though Harry Potter is a legacy student, it's a very satisfying book for kids. I don't know about her other statements. Lots of writers and athletes are providing entertainment and maybe they are more shallow, just selling escape entertainment or trying to draw a crowd to a stadium for fame."

LateStageCapitalism,ffadrcm,t3_esdxsx,1579733181.0,"The firefighting foam that contains PFAs has caused many problems around military bases, naval, air force. How come these places use so much firefighting foam? Or does the foam expire and they dump it out? I think the answer is that every single base does training.

>A vast aircraft testing facility in the high desert north of  Lancaster, Edwards has 24 contaminated sites where firefighting foam was  sprayed heavily.  
>  
>At a training site where firefighters practiced dousing flames with  the toxic foam, the contamination level in soil samples reached 18,000  parts per trillion, more than 250 times higher than the EPA threshold,  according to a contractor's 2018 report to the Air Force.

>Pre-industrial human BLL measurements are estimated to have been  0.016 µg/dL, and this level increased markedly in the aftermath of the  industrial revolution. At the end of the late 20th century, BLL  measurements from remote human populations ranged from 0.8 to 3.2 µg/dL.  Children in populations adjacent to industrial centers in developing  countries often have average BLL measurements above 25 µg/dL."
