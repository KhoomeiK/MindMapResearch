worldnews,ff67f9s,t1_ff65rbr,1579620917.0,"Fat the nutrient should be consumed regularly in recommended quantities (a pretty wide range) from a variety of animal and plant sources with minimal processing and avoiding excess saturated fat.

Body fat is accumulated excess of calories (not only fat calories but all calories) that, for healthy men, should generally never be below 5-8% of body weight for health and cushioning of your major organs and your brain. For peak health, it's not even unreasonable to have 12% body fat, and will depend person to person. Accumulating 20% body fat or more starts to get hazardous, and 30% will pretty much guarantee long-term health detriments to a mild or to a severe degree. Accumulating 40% body fat or more will expect to easily subtract a decade or more off of your life expectancy and significantly reduce the quality of life of the years you do get to experience.

All of these do damage over time, and it will very rarely not be extremely beneficial to lose weight to the target range, moreso the younger you are.

Keeping body fat between 5-15% of body weight (a very sizable range) will keep anybody in fantastic shape, provided it's achieved by calorie management of nutritious foods and vigorous exercise and not, for example, eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia. 

The body fat numbers above will vary for women, I just don't have those numbers off the top of my head.

Go to r/Documentaries to see yesterdays top post of the autopsy of a morbidly obese woman to hear expert opinions for *how* exactly excess body fat damages most of your major organs over time. NSFW."

Another potential option might be buying a bigger house that you then rent out and live with your tenants. You can find stories of people living rent free or at a profit doing this, depending on the circumstances.

As I mentioned elsewhere I'd still probably stay where you are, but I have different tolerances than a lot of people on this sub.

Is it an option to shop around for a different job that you don't despise? Not every job is quite as bad as the one you describe. One point of financial independence I lean heavily on is that having money allows you happiness, so working somewhere that you hate yourself for lots of money can be self-defeating. But hey for $190k I might be willing to hate myself for a couple years too.

I'm realizing that nowhere did I give you concrete advice but I hope it was at least a little helpful."
financialindependence,fdm1213,t1_fdm08m7,1578537275.0,"There's more to rent vs. buy than the plain expected return. 

People have different risk tolerances, and buying a house leverages your investment very hard at first. People often make out like bandits this way, but ask anyone who bought at the peak of the mid 2000s housing market how they felt about that house for the next 10 years. Depending on where you live, they may have yet to return to their purchase price.

Owning a house also carries more short-term risk in that if you need to move for some reason in the first few years, you may have not hit your breakeven point yet, and could potentially be selling at a loss on top of that.

Or more simply, some people can just be debt averse in general. We know good debt exists, but I still take comfort in things like owning my car outright.

So no, it is not ""nonsensical"" to rent. This is a dead horse you're beating as everyone knows there are pros and cons. It's fine to rent as long as you know what you're giving up for what you're getting, and are comfortable with that."

nba,fdkurz7,t1_fdkqqiu,1578511581.0,"Yeah debt selling is totally fine in and of itself, and I'd argue necessary for some businesses to recoup some of their losses for doubtful accounts, and not use their resources towards debt collections of which they are probably not equipped for. It's just that people who do it are often scum of the earth and very often see no recourse for harassment amd dehumanizing practices. The examples shown by John Oliver are infuriating. 

I just don't like when the typical reddit knee-jerk reaction is to immediately jump to outlawing debt-sale entirely. That's how the world works and is beneficial if done better."
todayilearned,fdkrdvr,t1_fdkqbuw,1578509568.0,"> He turned it in anonymously, and ended up getting sentenced to 14 years for unrelated crimes, the owner got sentenced to 30.

Putting this in the same sentence implies causality. It's MUCH easier to get clearer than this. Notice how many people came in here thinking the two were related?

One alternative example that I've, yes, *easily* come up with:

> He turned it in anonymously and the owner got sentenced to 30 years.

It's not relevant to the act described, so it doesn't belong in the title. Tangential information being put where it doesn't belong causes these misunderstandings because it's assumed to have greater importance than it already does.
