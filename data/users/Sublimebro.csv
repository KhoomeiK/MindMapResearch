self,fcok9aj,t3_ehxhzd,1577834342.0,"Mostly running related. Not really ‚Äúresolutions‚Äù but stuff that I‚Äôm doing that are my accomplishments for this year that I‚Äôm proud of! 

Run 2020 miles in 2020 (at least)

Running a full marathon in October

Half marathon in May 

Half marathon trail race this spring 

Bolder Boulder 10k race in Colorado in May

Dirty Kanza gravel bike race in June

Straight A‚Äôs in all of my college classes. 

Also I‚Äôve been spending too much time on Reddit recently so I want to see if I can not get on Reddit at all in January. This will oddly enough be the hardest of all of these lol."
vegan,fcj708v,t3_ef1yg9,1577678841.0,Your happiness is contagious! I love your energy.
cats,fcik05n,t1_fciju6a,1577663834.0,The trick is to not move so you don‚Äôt upset the blanket. Remain very still and try to keep a warm body temperature! Remember that you‚Äôre here for the blanket!
cats,fcij8la,t1_fciix93,1577663461.0,I think there‚Äôs something wrong with it! [Half of the blanket is sliding off](https://i.imgur.com/S1w5Bm6.jpg)
RunningCirclejerk,fcifwyz,t3_ehb5wv,1577661927.0,Wow nice so you‚Äôll be running 1.2 miles next week? Very dumb. Let me know how the full knee placement surgery goes.
RunningCirclejerk,fcga6wd,t1_fcg20t7,1577638030.0,You‚Äôre hopeless. Go have some GU and rethink your life please.
AskMen,fcfhv7j,t3_eh07g4,1577630116.0,Finished my last semester of college with straight A‚Äôs. Running 40 miles a week. Working full time. Life is super hectic and busy right now but it‚Äôs been such a confidence booster to be doing it all successfully. This sort of thing would have stressed me out just a year ago.
RunningCirclejerk,fccsa1f,t1_fcb7ky2,1577602035.0,"Make sure you get the Garmin 945 bare minimum. You‚Äôll get made fun of otherwise. The other garmins are basically fitbits. 

I like to dry my GU in the freezer and then crush it up and snort it before a race or a long run (long runs are at least 1 mile). Maybe you could try I injecting it into your butt."
cats,fc911sc,t1_fc62mwm,1577545304.0,*also give me some cat treats and a few head scratches*
RunningCirclejerk,fc75xmc,t1_fc6z56g,1577498413.0,Are these supportive enough? I‚Äôm looking for a shoe with a lot of support and cushioning. I over prostate horribly according to fleet feet.
RunningCirclejerk,fc6lg4y,t1_fc6d596,1577483361.0,I bet I‚Äôm more fat and depressed than you are
RunningCirclejerk,fc6lcuv,t1_fc6ks5p,1577483301.0,Great advice. I just pooped my pants. Thanks.
RunningCirclejerk,fc6i76z,t1_fc6huf4,1577481170.0,Sure but I hope you can jog a 39 minute 5k
RunningCirclejerk,fc6hst2,t1_fc6hoq3,1577480899.0,Sorry I ate too much GU
RunningCirclejerk,fc6hmte,t1_fc6h2d0,1577480788.0,What the crap dude!!!!! I swear if I was out running and we passed each other I wouldn‚Äôt even wave at you. Frick off!!!!!!!!!!

RunningCirclejerk,fc6fxom,t1_fc6fu9e,1577479643.0,Yeah they‚Äôre lame and horrible trainers. They only last 100 miles. I want a shoe that will last me longer than a year.
RunningCirclejerk,fc6fuc9,t1_fc6flly,1577479580.0,Oh yeah? Sizing me up on my own post? Well I‚Äôm faster than you idiot. I‚Äôd be willing to train you but it‚Äôs gonna cost you because I don‚Äôt work with slow hobby jogger idiots that are slower than me for free.
RunningCirclejerk,fc6fdg6,t1_fc6f1p6,1577479260.0,I run on my hands you moron
RunningCirclejerk,fc6equ8,t1_fc6ekyf,1577478835.0,Okay but I just read born to run and they all ran in sandals. Clearly what the guy is running in is a sandal.
running,fc5k6lk,t3_egbsym,1577459807.0,"You build discipline not motivation. If you wait for motivation then you‚Äôll be waiting around forever in all aspects of life. Just keep forcing yourself to run for a while until you‚Äôre disciplined to not need motivation to get out the door. 

Once you build that discipline that thought of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go run‚Äù will still be there, but the thought of ‚ÄúI have to if I want to accomplish my goals‚Äù will be stronger.

Also you probably should accept that you‚Äôre starting running at a different point in your life. Don‚Äôt compare your fitness now to where you used to be or it‚Äôll be discouraging. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with starting over! Especially if you‚Äôre doing something about it."
attackontitan,fc4gpf5,t3_e2i82o,1577416151.0,I just started watching this and I can‚Äôt stop laughing! It‚Äôs like watching old home videos of some of your close friends. Seriously the cutest thing ever. Every time they introduce a character I chuckle.
running,fc49348,t1_fc48isi,1577409950.0,Yeah that‚Äôs a fair point. My claim was anecdotal. Just my experience with the two.
running,fc479w4,t3_eg1w6r,1577408526.0,I love both. I do a lot of gravel biking and 40-50 miles of running per week. In my experience running has helped my cycling fitness. Cycling has not at all helped my running fitness. *Maybe* it has helped me not lose fitness as fast? It definitely hasn‚Äôt helped my running though.
running,fc473r5,t3_eg2vjj,1577408397.0,First poop after eating. Always.
running,fc46t4n,t1_fc3mh6g,1577408172.0,I‚Äôd vote getting a Garmin. The Apple Watch is pretty sweet but if it were me I‚Äôd get years more use out of a high quality fitness tracker over a smart watch that probably won‚Äôt be as future proof as a Garmin. Garmin is pretty well known for lasting a long time and continuing to roll out updates for years.
running,fc46hxt,t1_fc3rh7d,1577407929.0,"I‚Äôd vote for the 245 as well. The forerunner 2xx series has sort of been the staple garmin model for a while for running. I have the 935 which is an incredible watch, but it‚Äôs probably a little overpowered for what I need it for which is just running and cycling."
running,fc2uc77,t1_fc2evjb,1577374272.0,Also doing 40-45. I ran 15 miles last Sunday and I was starving a few hours after. I just couldn‚Äôt eat enough. The next day I was fine. One time I did run 12 miles and didn‚Äôt eat anything that night and went to bed. Felt absolutely horrible the next morning. So definitely make sure you eat enough.
vegan,fc1qtrn,t1_fc1emi8,1577326804.0,"That person is you. You‚Äôve posted a link to that person‚Äôs eBay account dozens of times in the last couple of ~~weeks~~ months.

Edit: Lol OP deleted their comments"
running,fc1l1i5,t1_fc1kffe,1577321950.0,Thank you! I just got into gravel biking last year. I‚Äôve made some of the best friends through that sport already.
RunningCirclejerk,fc1kuk3,t3_efn249,1577321785.0,"I also ran a 5k marathon today! A fellow athlete waved at me while I was on my run and I just started hysterically crying. I used to be 400 pounds and I‚Äôve never felt this level of acceptance before with athletes. I yelled a classic ‚Äúrun forest run!‚Äù at him and I took one of the energy gels that my hubby got for me and trotted up to them and I just couldn‚Äôt help but tell them all about how euphoric I was feeling from him waving at me. 

I must have really left an impression and motivated him because he sped way up after our conversation on my irritable bowel syndrome and how I always run with a diaper. I told him how sometimes I use a dirty sock to wipe my ass after shitting in people‚Äôs front yards and just bury the sock outside of their house. Just runner things though üòÇüòÇüòÇ Us runners sure love poop talk! Very nice guy! Thankfully it tagged us together on Strava so I plan to meet him at his start point every day at 3 pm and join him for a daily run! I‚Äôm going to surprise him tomorrow with some brown socks (inside joke!!!) Here‚Äôs to the new year right! So glad to be part of this amazing running community!!!"
