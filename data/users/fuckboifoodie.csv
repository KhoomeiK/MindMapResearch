politics,ffe8sqr,t1_ffdwzdi,1579839833.0,"While the desire to join the European Union was voiced by the  president of Georgia in 2011, it does not make then a member of continental Europe.

The context was the impeachment mangers from the house saying that the Ukraine incursion was the 1st effort to redraw European borders since WW2.  This statement is not untrue just because the Asian country of Georgia sought protection against Russian aggression by appealing to the EU.

For example, Turkey has also expressed interest in joining the EU and has a border on the East with Europe and one on the West with Asia.  By attacking Syria they are not trying to redraw European borders but rather Asia."

However, in this example this girl is putting some effort into it.  She's clearly imitating wonder and that is of some merit.  If they closed the area down and used it for a commercial shoot we wouldn't be criticizing, it would be bizness as usual.

movies,ff21d1j,t1_ff1tgmp,1579491170.0,"In the US this is completely dependent on demographic in my experience.  The fancier ones absolutely have a higher age but the more common 'affordable' home in my experience skew much younger.  

One of the main reasons behind this being that most individuals using Medicare only facilities are there for lack of any other option so they often arrive in ill health to begin with, holding out for as long as possible rather than have to live in these places that are less than desirable.

You either need to be top 10% in terms of net worth or put a huge emphasis on an expensive long term care policy during your working years to get to one of the nice ones where people in their late 80's and early 90's are the norm.

Tl;DR:  Be a good human to your kids or prioritize long term care spending more if you live in the USA."

How does your coffee lend itself to cold brew?  If it has double the caffeine it could potentially make the concentrate last longer and open up more variety in mixing options.

How does your coffee do as an espresso?  Is it possible to brew a traditional single espresso that has roughly the same caffeine content as a cup of coffee?"
