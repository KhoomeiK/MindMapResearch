Gusgus was a hard cat to care for (he had pica, which is why he died of a bowel obstruction, plus rarely used his litterbox) but easy to love. He was very sweet and loved my husband. 

Oddly enough the next two kitties we got are basically Gusgus' personalities in two sides. The slightly anxious side that likes being near people (Calcifer) and the snuggly love people and sleeps in your arms' side with Toby. We like to think that Gus sent us them to be his successors that would take good care of his human."

He was freaked out and asked my mom if people normally felt relaxed like that mentally. 

I think he tossed the script because he has a family history of alcoholism (both parents do. Dad doesn't drink at all. Mom has some wine occasionally) 

He likely has tourettes syndrome. He clears his throat every 7 seconds exactly while awake. I only noticed it after I moved away and was visiting. That's basically his tic I guess."

His nervousness came out more as he got older oddly enough. It peaked at like 2-3. At 5 he seems to be mellowing out. He's just a bit more high strung than the other 2. 

He's actually been quite affectionate (for him) lately. He sleeps on my feet or next to me all day."
