unpopularopinion,fgsha09,t1_fgsarqa,1581084291.0,"It is no coincidence that this kind of book succeeds and that one of the most common sexual fantasies amongst women are rape fantasies. 

Of course there is a huge difference between having a rape fantasy and wanting to actually get raped and that needs to be distinguished when talking about these kinds of fantasies. 

It boils down to the power dynamic of a sexual, or sometimes even non sexual, scenarios that most women enjoy to varying degrees and I don't think there is anything wrong with that. 

Every woman I have ever been with has enjoyed unbalanced power dynamics in the bedroom. It can be something as small as pulling their hair while you're doing doggy and saying things that imply ""ownership"" all the way up to full on simulated rape.

 I think books like 50 shades allow women to vicariously live out some of those fantasies that may be a little much for them to want to experience in real life."

Nothing major but definitely there. If you're interested there are many videos out there highlighting them. 

Don't get me wrong though I played the ptde millions of times using dsfix, it is my favourite game of all time but over all the remaster is just a much better experience than the ptde even with mods."

This isn't about money and it isn't a competition about who suffered the most, it is about allowing the child to have both of their parents around for a longer amount of time. It is about viewing the presence of both parents in the upbringing  of children as equally important and it is about breaking the stereotype that the woman is the one who should stay at home while the man goes off to work. 

But most of all it is about a nation collectively deciding that some things are more important than going to work. You will never get back those days while they're young and now people in Finland will no longer have to choose between eating and spending time with their young children."

For example you wouldn't say skyrim is a shitty port but going above 60fps in skyrim causes bugs because of the engine.

This might sound crazy but just let me run with it but  maybe, just maybe, they have a pram because they have a baby and they have a puppy. They look like they're coming from the beach, so it could be that they have been playing with their puppy on the beach and he got all tuckered out and so they picked him up and plopped him in the pram on their way back to the car.
