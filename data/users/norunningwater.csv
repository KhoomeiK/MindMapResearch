It is more like disparaging red delicious apples to a different type of apple that doesn't taste like horse meal and can throw a 90 kilogram object at least 300 meters.

Edit: I understand your meaning. As a category of siege weapons, the term catapult has become ubiquitous as the onager. Trebuchets deserve to be classified as a different siege weapon than the low-power man crusher onager catapult."
