service_dogs,ffivfd8,t3_etv5b7,1579983661.0,"Honestly if the dog tasks and the handler is disabled the dog is a service dog. Yes, pawing is a common alert behavior. So the fact is that this does sound like a service dog, I am not sure about the behavior of the dog while in public but that is honestly a secondary issue as the ADA only requires a dog to task for a disabled person. If this is a big enough issue then you need to either address it and if a compromise can't be made then I guess you need to let you and this person drift apart."
service_dogs,ffih6fz,t3_etr226,1579973778.0,"This is a task that my dog is going to be trained in as well. Like you I have poor circulation so if I sit still for too long my feet especially will get painfully cold, this happens even in warm environments, so I will be training my dog to lay on my feet to keep them warm"
illnessfakersgonewild,ffgd5wn,t1_ffdtq3j,1579903606.0,"I fully agree. Airlines do this regardless of the reason you need extra space, I don't see how disability makes your need for that space anymore valid than say a person with a health issue that causes them to be overweight, or whatever. The fact is that the accommodation for your disability is the fact that you have equal access to that space, it just so happens that you need to pay for it. Frankly on the same hand Personal Support Workers do not fly free with a disabled person, if your service animal requires additional space it is the disabled individuals responsibility to plan for that by getting an additional seat."
illnessfakersgonewild,ffdhpqr,t3_esybhk,1579821104.0,"Frankly like any other individual that needs extra space/baggage for any reason you should be required to pay for that extra space. You chose to have a large breed dog or mini horse as a service animal, and having to purchase an extra seat on an airplane is just one consequence of that choice. You are not entitled to encroach on my or anyone elses space just because you chose to have a service dog. Just like wheelchairs being difficult to impossible to use in certain terrains, a service animal has certain inherent downsides.

Sincerely a large breed service dog handler that would have to purchase the extra seat on a ticket."
childfree,ffa61vn,t3_esfxgd,1579728584.0,"I low key want somebody to try making that comment to me. I will sit and wait for them to find me a kid that can alert to my high heart rate, reliably work as my eyes around traffic and in the snow and not give me attitude when I drop my wallet for the 50th time and need them to pick it up for me. I will wait. Parents seem to get away with being complete dicks to everyone around them and frankly I could do with letting my inner bitch out more."
service_dogs,ffa4qm9,t3_esgsa9,1579727851.0,"I do appreciate that they are proposing stricter requirements for all animals in the cabin of aircraft, I would even support a requirement to get a trainer to sign off on the dog passing a PAT or something to fly in the cabin as a service dog. The fact is that aircraft pose a very distinct difference that is simply not present in public access scenarios, once the plane takes off it is no longer as simple as exiting the plane to remove a dangerous dog or to get a victim medical attention. The plane would have to land first, which dependent on where they are it might be hours before the dog can be removed or the victim received medical attention because they are over say an ocean when turbulence hits. 

I have not had an opportunity to read all 90 pages but what I have seen thus far I think is reasonable. Space is in high demand on an airplane, setting the requirement that our service animals must not encroach on the space of other passengers I feel is reasonable even though it may alienate handlers of larger breeds for the simple fact that we are not entitled to the space of another or to potentially endanger another(let our animals encroach on the aisle for example). By that extension the only reason outside of health concerns that I can see as reasonable for a well behaved service animal be denied as an accommodation is if the size simply cannot be accommodated, basically I agree that breed specific bans have no business being a thing."
service_dogs,ff6zwas,t3_eryarx,1579638320.0,"If you qualify for an organization I highly recommend going that route. Training your own service dog is a lot of work, money and risk. You are most likely going to have to wash your dog out. The fact is that if your family is not 100% on board then I would wait until you are out of the house, since if they aren't 100% on board they will likely to prove to be the biggest obstacle in your way to success.

I tried to train my service dog while attending classes, which was the worst choice I could have made. I did rush into a less than suitable prospect and spent so much extra time and money trying to make it work, I had to drop out of college because I could not afford to do both successfully in terms of both time and money. Having a service dog in college and having a service dog in training in college are two very different beasts. A fully trained service dog all you have to do is maintenance training which can be done with a couple evenings a week brushing up on skills that are getting sloppy, a service dog in training needs your near constant attention to get those skills to that point.

I would first start by talking to your family. If they are fully on board then start looking at programs, I recommend looking through the ADI program list as sadly there are a lot of programs that gigantic scams. If you don't qualify for a program dog I would start by talking to trainers in your area(and save every cent, service dogs are expensive), make sure they are knowledgeable about service dogs and know how to train the tasks you need. I would have them help figure out what breed is best for your needs, then locate a reputable breeder and have your trainer temperament test the litter to help you find the best prospect. Once you have your prospect then you start the approximately 2 years of training."

But yeah at least in public our dogs do largely simply exist when they aren't actively tasking. They are normal dogs when not working and are loved in the same way as pets. But in terms of the sex, depending on what the dog is trained for let's say heart rate alerts the dog sometimes need to be locked out of the room or crated because the dog might try and alert during that activity. But yeah, I was thinking specifically thinking of ""The Healing Powers of Dude"" which does have a lot of misinformation, or any of the other shows that have misbehaving ""service dogs"" in public."
servicedogs,ff6k57g,t1_ff5w4rm,1579628922.0,"Ugh, the person that made me swear off youtube for service dog content had a taxidermied wolf she claimed was a service dog then got a german shepherd that had worms from questionable background. It is now working as a service dog despite having bitten her, and being clearly shut down in videos and the handler having abused this dog claiming that hitting the dog is training.... The whole situation is a shit show, I do not recommend trying to find the individual.

I hate how people have zero respect for service dog handlers are just not respected. I have told the tenants in my housing program that they cannot pet my dog when she is vested, 90% of the tenants and staff respect the vest. One has poor memory so I suspect that I will never not be bothered by him, but I don't mind as much because frankly we have the same conversation about my Mom's motorcycle since the snow hit the ground in November so I legitimately believe he keeps forgetting. This other tenant on the other hand I know for a fact does not have that difficulty with memory, he just refuses to respect me telling him not to call her when she is working. He has also started to bleed all over the lobby and is often belligerant bordering on violent in the lobby so I have come to feel unsafe around him, and because we see each other daily he is a person Saria struggles to ignore.

As for why I have no issue seeing non-service dogs using ""working"" patches, it can simply be explained that all cats are mammals but not all mammals are cats. A service dog is a type of working dog but service work is not the only job a dog can do. Take a search and rescue dog for example, that is a dog that works but that does not mean it is a service dog. Now if that search and rescue dog and handler did not meet the legal definition of a service dog was taken in public, then we would have an issue but inherently other dogs wearing ""working"" patches is not a problem. Both ""in training"" and ""working"" simply means that the dog is either being trained or is trained to perform a job they alone do not specify what job, it is the people who use them to take advantage of the law that are at fault not the patches themselves."
service_dogs,ff52tmt,t1_ff4zi2x,1579578694.0,"Yeah, only time will tell if speaking with the Executive committee has solved any of the problems. The thing I have not disclosed yet with the individual is that my current girl is a lab mix with very short fur, I am hopefully going this weekend to go meet a breeder of collies hoping to get a rough coat for sensory reasons. I am hoping to bring a prospect home this Spring/Summer, I am sure she will be thrilled when that dog starts to take over for my retiring girl.

service_dogs,ff4tr3z,t3_ermrfz,1579572243.0,"I have honestly been dealing with this exact issue in my choir, I joined back in September initially without my dog because we were working on perfecting the down stay and I hoped I could handle this without her. I was not, basically I do have an diagnosed issue with my heart/autonomic nervous system that she does respond to. The second practice I actually fainted and regained use of my voice in time to call off the EMS call. At that point I decided that it was either I bring my dog or choir is just something I can no longer do, so I spoke with the executive committee just as a consideration and mostly to give them time to speak with the choir so that anyone with allergies could be seated away from me or whatever. 

Fast forward a couple months to a week before our concert, my dog has become well practiced at sitting through practice. She is still not ready for 6hr days so I have made arrangements with the choir to allow somebody to be in the audience to act as my helper for the day for free in the absence of my dog and somebody else to watch her for the day. This has been arranged for about a month at the time, and a couple of ""anonymous complaints"" have been made to me throughout the season but I finally put what I thought was an end to the harassment by showing my doctor's letter and discussing in detail why I needed her. Legitimately a week before the concert I was pulled aside by the same woman who kept harassing me to discuss accommodations for the concert, and the dog came up again. I simply reiterated why my dog was important to my ability to participate, went over how I make sure I keep allergens to a minimum and assured her I would be talking with the Executive committee since this was harassment and she was attempting to violate my human rights.

I am sorry, but I am not going to allow myself to be bullied out of an otherwise amazing choir that I have loved singing alongside. Literally everyone except that woman has been very welcoming of us and taken the couple slip ups in stride(she gave a startled bark when the person beside us dropped their music on her head and accidentally took another member's cane out with her tail). She is now perfect with the choir and I feel much safer attending with her by my side, knowing that if something goes wrong I do have what I need to lessen the impact of my body deciding to act up."
servicedogs,ff4imnk,t1_ff4d286,1579564511.0,"Thanks, I sort of picked it at random when I joined with the intention of changing it when I found something better but instead fell in love with it.

It does seem to happen that when people bother to really look into and understand the service dog laws that they also really pay attention to their dogs. Unfortunately this is a rarity, and I am even starting to see training classes with program dogs where the entire class are shut down. The fact is that it seems to be becoming acceptable for service dogs to be shut down or have behavioral issues which is just not cool in my opinion.

I am not sure how often a dog is kept working because of Insta-popularity, but I know there are a lot that continue to work their dog because they can't for one reason or another pull from PA. I know there was a pretty big Instagramer who mentioned that his dog shuts down in school but because he can't attend school without a service dog that he will continue to work her. That is precisely the reason I feel that you need to first function without a service dog before you get one, and you must continue to have that ability while having the dog.

As far as gear goes it has been my experience that as long as you explain to the maker the situation and don't get ""service dog"" patches on it that they are typically willing to sell to the average Joe an ""in training"", ""do not pet"", ""fearful"", etc gear. Even ""working"" I don't mind being on non-service dogs just as long as they don't claim to be a service dog."

Honestly I do wish there was some way to guarantee that anyone who wanted a dog service dog or not had at least an understanding in dog body language, because the number of shut down dogs I see in public is astounding. 

Honestly the ""not a true Scottsman"" drives me up a wall. A ""friend"" of mine(only such because they are part of my friend group), is definitely disabled and the dog does for sure task for her as he loves to press the handicap buttons to death. But this dog is terrified of his shadow, loves kids and dogs to the point that he screams at them while suffocating himself and has scratched up and peed in my other friend's car. This dog on all accounts is a mess and the dog does (not as often as it should be) and should be removed for the behavior. But despite that under the laws that make it a criminal act to fake a service dog she cannot be charged because she is disabled and the dog tasks. People love to claim to know the ADA, but frankly I call bull shit. I am Canadian, so the ADA doesn't even apply to me but I have a better understanding of the laws than most American based handlers and that is just sad."

service_dogs,ff0odgj,t3_er2ts0,1579470759.0,"June or July is at most going to get you a prospect to start training a service dog, even then if you are looking to rush getting a service dog statistically speaking you are going to fail and waste thousands of dollars. I would start looking at programs and expect to wait 2+ years to be placed with a service dog. If you are going the owner training route I would start with finding a trainer, and working with them to select a breed that fits your lifestyle and needs. Then you will want to carefully select a breeder to get your prospect from and have that trainer temperament test the litter. This is unlikely to be do able before June/July and you will likely find that you are looking at a June/July 2021 arrival for your prospect, by the time you get everything in place to be successful. After the puppy comes home you are looking at several thousand dollars in training, gear, vet expenses and 2+ years of training. Meaning that by the time you have a fully trained service dog it will likely be 2023, assuming the dog does not wash out and that is an estimated 60% chance of happening meaning your efforts will have to start from the beginning setting you back another several years."

The fact that breed only matters if you intend to breed the dog, which is frankly false and I am not sure where you got that from.

The fact is while well bred purebreeds are no guarantee in terms of temperament or health, they are in fact a million times more predictable than a mixed breed. To put it simply you would not get a beagle to herd sheep, they are bred for two very different jobs and even a poorly bred beagle will not have that herding instinct that makes a border collie excel at the job. My comment was talking in probability, which the probability of a mixed breed excelling in a particular job is minimal especially when the breeds that make up the dog are so different. You might get insanely lucky and find a husky-shepherd mix that excels at IPO but the brother might have all the drive to pull sleds of a husky and nothing for IPO, you just can't predict what instincts might be present for a mixed breed like you can a well bred purebreed. The breed standard for some breeds just lend themselves better to service work than other breeds, again they are not bad dogs and the breeds are not an impossibility to succeed but the breed standard which every reputable breeder of the breed will be breeding towards will give you the highest probability of success."

Allergies, dysplasia, food sensitivities among other conditions appear in much higher rates in mixed breeds than the well bred purebred dogs.

Can a mix breed work? Absolutely, my girl is a lab mixed with a staffordshire bull terrier and she is a fine service dog. But that does not mean I recommend going with a mix because of lack of predictable temperament, instincts and health.

dogs,fea6e27,t3_eo5ud3,1578944881.0,"Where I used to live there was this woman that frequently walked her dog off leash, and I use the phrase loosely. She and her dog were outside at the same time, that is about the extent of the ""supervision"", this dog is also aggressive though also old and stiff so it is more than possible to get away and hide if you see the dog soon enough. Routinely this dog would be in the park harassing other dog owners or children, while the woman would be five minutes down the road from even entering the park. This dog would be alone along the back road as well which is high traffic for the area, and often we have young drivers that drive recklessly down that road. I have been caught off guard by this dog on several occasions, luckily I was able to protect my dog from it but I have ripped clothes and have been gotten on multiple times by this dog. Each time reported to the authorities but still she does this, so now every time I return to visit friends and family I am afraid that this will happen again. 

One time she and her dog entered the park at the same time, the dog was of course off leash. I was already there and had sat down because I was having a really bad medical episode. So when the dog off course approached mine I called for her to control her dog. When she did not I tried to leave but because of the episode I did not get far and fainted. When I woke up she was close by with her dog finally on a leash. My dog was laying on me like she was trained to but barked once as the woman stepped closer with the dog, which at the time of this incident had already attacked us on a couple occasions. She then told me to control my dog who did not even get up, and was silent outside of that one bark. The woman proceeded to take a picture of me still on the ground promising to report me to the authorities. In the end nothing came of it, but still this woman has a problem.

It really is not fair that one person can cause such damage, both physically and psychologically. I am honestly glad that even service dogs are not exempt from leash laws, because that is a popular excuse used by this woman and other reactive/aggressive off leash dogs.

As I said the circumstances you speak of are times when the dog can and should be removed, but they cannot deny access proactively without the dog displaying such behavior.

Sure, fakes by nature are not trained to the same standard but saying the issue is all because of fakes is ignorant. It is aggressive or reactive dogs that are in public that are the problem."
service_dogs,fdta17o,t3_emzd6j,1578713875.0,"> As far as people saying over-dependence is possible especially for PSDs, I think this view is somewhat condescending. Correct me if this isn't right but it seems to me when people say that, they are saying a person's psychiatric disability is something they need to ""work through on their own"" or without depending on a dog. If your psychiatric condition is truly disabling as determined by you and your doctor, then working through it on your own. If medication or therapy are not routes one has taken for whatever reason, then a service dog is a valid avenue. 

It might seem condescending, but the fact is that of all the varieties of service dogs psychiatric service dogs are most commonly victims of the over-reliance issue. I will say up front that yes, people with other disabilities can and due develop an over-reliance on their dog but I will say that overwhelmingly my experience is that it is more common to see in people disabled by mental illness with medical alert being a definite second. Anyways the problem with this comes when the dog clearly needs to at minimum be pulled from public access to work on a problem. Often the reason is that they can't afford to stop working the dog, or they can't function without the dog. The fact is often I see issues that could easily be addressed with a few weeks spent working on the problem in some pet friendly locations, but because the handler ""can't"" function without the dog it gets to a point that the dog can no longer work and must be washed. Worst case scenario the dog attacks somebody or a service dog, best case the dog is just shut down in public and the handler washes the dog out.

The fact is that regardless of the nature of your disability you need to be able to function at some level before you bring a service dog. A service dog can be a massive improvement to your quality of life but they get sick, don't feel like working, need work or need to retire suddenly. The fact is anybody needs to be able to live without their service dog since life happens and they may not be able to work a particular day."

My fucks begin and end with safety, if the dog is likely to attempt to bite mine then I don't care if it is a Seeing Eye Dog or ""fake"" psychiatric service chihuahua it should not be in public putting my safety at risk. At the end of the day I low key would not mind seeing a certification for any animal that a person wishes to bring into public spaces be it a service dog or pet, assuming that certification tests that a dog can be safe around the public and other dogs. Same rules for removal would have to apply as for service animals as well."
service_dogs,fdl6sc4,t1_fdkpjxx,1578518015.0,"In this case it is because the dog could actually harm patients, ignoring the usual dander/allergen concerns because we know that people with pets frequently carry that around anyways, the dog very well could be carrying something that could cause major complications for patients in certain units. I see this as a precaution because unlike any other piece of medical equipment they can play host to diseases that could easily infect those who are sensitive to illnesses already. Either way, I can see how this would be considered reasonable for places like hospitals or zoos for the safety of the patients and animals. Since the dog poses unique risks that other medical equipment simply cannot in such situations."
service_dogs,fdkgl72,t1_fdjlxf9,1578503432.0,"There are so many reasons a person might not have their dog in a particular situation. Coming home for work where their disability is mitigated through other means and they need a couple ingredients for dinner. The dog is sick and they can't put life on hold because the dog's stomach is upset. They are having a good day and can manage their disability with other tools and tricks. They are going somewhere they are not legally protected to have the dog. None of these examples invalidate a person's need for a service dog, but instead highlight the need for the person to be prepared to not have their dog with them for a time, it is irresponsible to not have a backup plan that does not include your dog to mitigate your disability(ies).  


For example I am going to my friend's wedding in the summer and won't be taking my dog. Instead I will be using my wheelchair and my other friend has said she will help me if I need it, because another friend is afraid of dogs and I do not wish to spend the time accommodating each other's needs. Plus frankly it will be a long day with no way for me to just leave if my dog starts to feel tired or sick, so it just makes more sense for me to work without her for the day(she is moving towards early retirement, prospect should be home this year). I am still disabled and sure it would be safer for me to have her with me, but with the wheelchair at least I don't have to worry about concussions when I faint. Again, just because I am planning to go to an event without my dog does not mean she is any less important to my treatment plan. It simply means I know the limits of us as a team and work within them."

If your anxiety can be handled just with meditation and a good diet getting a service dog is not an appropriate step in your treatment plan. A service dog is often the last resort because it is the most time consuming and expensive option, but for some situations like one that might require surgery to even attempt to make it better then it is understandable to pursue a service before that surgery. At the end of the day it really is not my business how one comes to the decision, and at the end of the day I really only care if that animal harm my team."

(PLEASE NOTE: IM NOT SAYING A SERVICE DOG ISNT THE RIGHT ROUTE FOR YOU.) But I've known handlers who hopped right into it, got a dog less than 6 months after they made the decision (started owner training) only to realize that they weren't ready for the problems that come with a service dog, or that a service dog wont help them as much as they thought, or their life has suddenly changed in a way that makes it where a service dog wont fit in their life anymore. Then they end up having to wash the dog, and either go through the struggle of rehoming it or they now have to figure out the costs associated with having a pet. 

So much this, in the end I came to the conclusion that a service dog was the best decision I could make for my health and life situation, but that does not mean it was not one \*\*\*\* of a bumpy road getting there. I rushed into getting a dog as soon as I finished the college for the summer, with the intent to take the summer to train the dog to come back to part time studies with me. Because I did not take my time I made so many mistakes that cost me my schooling and thousands in correcting. In the end my dog did work out, but it was made a thousand times harder because I did not take the  appropriate care in preparing for the commitment. My dog will likely never shed the ""in-training"" because by the time I corrected the issues we had encountered, her health is meaning I must plan make plans for her retirement as despite it being manageable and safe for her to work now it is not fair to keep her working in the long term. Additionally, the dog was a source of much conflict with my family more so than friends, but I did lose friends because of the dog. I do believe that if more time was spent working with the individuals to compromise on the needs of all involved that we might not have had the massive family feud we did. In the end we did figure something out(moved family events to the party room in the apartment of one family member), but again not without a huge conflict.

TLDR: I wish I took time to really research and prepare for the dog. I lacked the knowledge and resources to be successful. I could have also worked with those in my life who had concerns to find something that worked for all involved."

Honestly while we did not live in an apartment she would have done fine in one as long as she was exercised which your routine sounds like it would have been sufficient. My Grandpa and I took couple hour walks on a friend's land twice a week, and about an hour a night with some days where we just could not fit it into our schedule with homework and my family working out of town in the snow belt meaning we were stranded away from home sometimes for days.

To set the stage, my friend had one last class to finish college and was set to need to start paying the $20,000 in loans in the next 9 months. She just got fired from her job and her abusive parents said if she went forward with getting a dog they would stop paying her rent and phone bills. She confided in me that she had $400 in savings and that was before she got fired, not working a month and having to pay for food likely spent that or if her parents fed her that is still not much. She was getting a dog because she was convinced that she needed a service dog after seeing my friend and I with ours. Anyways, all of a sudden before she got a job she brought home this 4 week old shepherd mix puppy, and immediately started begging for supplies. She luckily started working a week and a half later, leaving this young puppy home alone for 12+ hours at a time(security at a bar) because she worked late into the evening and the buses stopped running just after midnight and well before her shift ended. Fast forward a year, this puppy is a year and has bitten my friend's service dog who has now retired because that was the straw that broke the camel's back. This dog still works and has bitten at least one other dog, and she can't afford to see a trainer and refuses to wash the dog out even though it is aggressive and has a bite history.

I know some are because of irresponsible dog owners not picking up or controlling their animals, which if that were strictly the case then you would have a case for reasonable accommodation for having a trained service animal with you. But if pets are not permitted because they are having an negative impact on the wildlife then that would fundamentally alter the operation of the park and it would not be a reasonable accommodation to permit the dog to accompany you to work.

That being said under the ADA technically a diagnosis is not even required, just that your activities of daily living are negatively impacted and that there are tasks that the dog performs that help you perform activities of daily living that you could not do before."

I have been literally cornered by a person demanding to know my private medical information, and then telling me I am horrible for taking my fake service animal into a pizza place. If you are triggered by talking about yourself then a service animal is an even worse choice, as you will likely find that is all people will ask you about and that will easily hit multiple times an hour. Nobody will leave you alone, they will demand personal information, they will harass you, will not respect your personal space, likely assault you or your dog. A dog can be trained in tasks that can help with those things, but it is exceedingly rare for the good to outweigh the negatives of having a service dog in the case of mental health disabilities.

Speaking of me personally my dog has given me the ability to be independent but limited my want to do so. I am autistic with some other mental health issues, but my main reason for getting a service dog is that I faint and have terrible balance so I primarily use retrievals and response tasks for the fainting. My hyper vigilance has been made a thousand times worse since I started taking her with me everywhere, as dogs barking and lunging at us is sadly a common occurrence. So are kids and grown adults lashing out at my dog because of a ""fear"" of dogs. 

Additionally service dogs are expensive. For my prospect I am budgeting $10,000 for the first year. Cutting corners on cost is possible but that is how you end up with a washed out service dog, rescuing is cheaper than getting a well bred golden but for a laundry list of reasons rescues are much more likely to wash than that well bred golden. Not working closely with a trainer throughout the whole process can save you money, but you could miss something in temperament testing or some training mistake could lead to a big issue down the road that means the dog must wash but could have been avoided by working with a trainer sooner. It can be done while cutting those corners but you are far more likely to fail doing so, especially with your first dog.

Now an in home service dog/emotional support animal (can be a cat) does sound like a good option for you, it would not help with the sensory overload in public but could help with your disabilities at home. The public is a non-issue and you don't have to be near as strict with the temperament, just that the dog wants to do the job. This also means rescuing is a viable option, all you need is a dog that fits into your lifestyle and wants to work. Ideally not have behavioral issues, trust me walking a reactive dog can be stressful especially if you don't know how to manage the issue."

This being said in my experience it is the off leash dogs and dogs on flexi-leashes especially if they are small breeds that are the problem.

Large dogs I don't really know, and have in the past actually kicked a dog to get it away from mine when I had no other option. 

In my experience it depends on how many animals you tend to see in public, the general leash culture(are leash laws obeyed, what is the most common leash type in your area, are the dogs typically reactive). The fact is if your area is filled with irresponsible dog owners then I would say your chances are pretty close to 100% that you will have your dog attacked at least a couple times in its career as a service dog with a real chance of a few times a year.

A dog that is too excited doing a task might be washed because of that excitement but as an at home service dog it really does not matter, because where the dog is working will always be pet friendly and assuming the dog is not causing physical harm it is acceptable. Plus any trick dog trainer can help you train most tasks, mobility like bracing, counterbalance and guide work should really only be done by people who have a solid understanding of the tasks and with the approval of at least one but preferably multiple orthopedic vets.

The fact is with an exclusion for retrieving/holding items, opening/closing doors, turning on/off lights the risk to the dog is unknown, for all we know we could be increasing their chances of developing arthritis by a substantial amount with these mobility tasks and simply not know it.
