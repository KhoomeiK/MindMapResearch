Society must somehow agree on this topic. And yes women breasts are sexual organ because one of its use is to attract opposite sex.

This concrete case is ridiculous in my opinion. She was at home. But yeah having stepchildren makes matter more complicated. But I would agree that fathers child care should be restricted but not women be charged."

Kenshi,femf0bx,t1_fema1s0,1579252062.0,To be fair. This list only works if you are interest in one of these games. They all scratch very specific itch. Ty interest fps player with this. Usual FPS player has different interests.

So what if there were ""potty trainers"" second years running after first graders casting their shit away? Maybe they create some ""rooms"" where people can come to get their shit ""cast away"". We could call it bathrooms...And lets not even mention what wizard does while with muggles? He cant cast so he needs to use toilet anyway."

Which all is irrelevant because they are killing people on foreign soil without trial. All what is needed is for US president to sign an order. So he could just order me killed and no one would bat an eye. Well maybe mild diplomatic backslash."

IsaacArthur,fdk8zrz,t1_fcvei5x,1578498798.0,"Just finished episode(late guy). What if you take many worlds theory. What happens is that the moment you travel to other time, you actually change its state this way creating new universe. This would mean you only can travel one way. Because traveling back just creates new universe again, because your state is different now. New universe state = universe state + your current state. Both change constantly.

And also lets say you travel with someone if you split you can never meet them again. Unless you have way to calculate state of universe with that someone after their arrival and travel to it.

You can be unique traveler because you could only travel universe states where only you invented time travel. Unless you decide to share it."
