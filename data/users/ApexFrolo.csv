bipolar,ff73v56,t3_ervdes,1579640590.0,Funny fact taking the meds actually also decreases our life expectancy by like 20 yrs to
bipolar,fezvvm5,t3_eqyrai,1579462334.0,No drinking I took like 8 triazolam

bipolar,fef2zgj,t1_fef0vpg,1579046963.0,Lamictial alone has changed my life for the better no more anxiety and I can finally notice when I'm about to have a episode and can take the right steps to avoid or more so pacisfy such experiances compared to lithium its a thousand times better I take 200mg a night and 150 in the am. Its hard to actually say how its effecting me becuse I'm still learning to live with this disorder but compared to no meds and now and trying over 42 diff types of meds this and the vraylar / ritalin has made me feel more happy and normal then lithium or anything else ever has!
bipolar,feeco23,t1_fee6e8m,1579031024.0,Imo stop and get on lamictial its far better I was taking over 1500mg of lithium and the shakes and brain fog just aren't worth it.
bipolar,fee635g,t1_fe8qzln,1579027163.0,I was on lithium for about a year it Defiantely helps with episode reduction but otherwise I had bad shakes and had to be put on Propranolol a beta blocker. And the monthly labs sucked
bipolar,fee5xph,t3_eo2w4u,1579027071.0,Ritalin is my favorite med by far it helps tons with my low days and gives me the energy the vraylar takes from me.
