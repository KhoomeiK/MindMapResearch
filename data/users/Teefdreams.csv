However, making friends in treatment (healthy friends) is a good idea. They understand you and you understand them."
bipolar,fcm0hmp,t1_fclt94g,1577761036.0,Are you sure you started at 200mg and didn't titrate up? I have a hard time  believing any doctor would do that.
bipolar,fcm0c23,t3_eht1y6,1577760923.0,Yes. Latuda is killing me. It's giving me intense nightmares which is leading to flashbacks and every day is a fucking living nightmare. I started it and am just getting worse and worse.
bipolar,fcm07f8,t3_ehq2us,1577760829.0,What are you using this for?
bipolar,fcm030l,t3_ehupqv,1577760739.0,"Personally, I would keep it between your treatment team, immediate family and trusted friends only.  
There are a lot of people who will look down on you, mistreat you, potentially look for an excuse to fire you etc."
bipolar,fclzwh5,t3_ehthat,1577760608.0,If you're making women uncomfortable you need therapy for it. You don't want to be called up for sexual harassment. And that's not a symptom of bipolar.
