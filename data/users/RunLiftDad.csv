Obviously there are experienced specialists who have developed successful strategies for trans persons, and these practices have a history of decades or more.

However, there are still huge unanswered questions. Why is gender dysphoria on the rise? Is there a peer pressure component? Is there a link to autism? Is there a link to trauma? Is GD hereditary? Can dietary habits or pharmaceutical use affect the fetus in-utero to predispose them to GD?

Have some compassion for ""CIS"" folks. Only a small percent of people have gender dysphoria, and the rest of us are essentially taking your word for it. GD is not the norm, and the world is slow to catch up."
