Your mom adding insult to injury is over the top. 

Love your creativity tho. Kudos."

dogs,ff411ys,t1_ff328ci,1579553223.0,"Often, another solution is to have another dog. Even tho it’s not a human, a dog is another being and one that’s calm can help keep a dog with Separation Anxiety calm. Again, crating right next to each other is optimum. Also, good tasting chew bones (the super hard ones that look like leg bones) given in the crate can help keep the dog occupied and have something to do. For escape artists, a pin crate is made of thicker gauge metal and a better choice than a folding crate or a plastic Kennel. You can always drape a towel or blanket over it to create more of a den type feel."

gofundme,ff2n5oh,t3_eqdlsk,1579514334.0,"Even with lease not being renewed, there is probably a month to month clause in your lease or by state law. If you have your lease, read it. Also check with your housing council. Plus, call an attorney who specializes in housing. You should be able to get a few answers to point you in the right direction. Do it today! Doesn’t sound like your landlord did it properly and is counting on you to not know your rights."
dogs,ff13k82,t1_ff0g09v,1579474844.0,"The other thing I have had great luck with is to crate them right next to each other for work and sleeping. Take turns who is out of the crate when people are home. After a few days, take both for a long walk first thing in the morning. Walks are bonding exercises for dogs. The happy fun associated with the walk get transferred to the other dogs.

Edit...typo"
gofundme,ff115g9,t3_eqdlsk,1579474220.0,"In NY, The Landlord MUST give you 30 days (1 month) written notice. It also starts from the first of the month. If he did not, you don’t have to move. You can negotiate with the new owners or force one or both of them to take you to court. Check your laws in PA."
