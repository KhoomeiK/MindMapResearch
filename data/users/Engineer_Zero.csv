MaliciousCompliance,ff7r1yy,t3_ertp8u,1579656281.0,That audio was everything I wanted and more. Thank you for making my day. Hope you’re ok after it all settled down!
YouShouldKnow,ff5ln4t,t1_ff34wsn,1579598941.0,BP in Australia has it too. It’s incredibly annoying. I’ll definitely try this tip
insanepeoplefacebook,ff2hpo4,t1_ff05r3l,1579506620.0,It’s delicious! A pancake is just a thick crepe
TrumpRoasts,femf6da,t3_eps5yr,1579252308.0,I don’t like trump as much as the next guy but I’m so sick of posts like this that mention a great quote but don’t provide a link to it.
pics,felr0pr,t1_fek4e3i,1579228828.0,Some parts yes. But the ash from the fires getting washed into water ways is killing all the fish. We literally can’t catch a break.
Damnthatsinteresting,feengo8,t1_fedcwj6,1579037309.0,Can you buy it online from another country? The US’ prices are obviously artificially inflated and it will be almost impossible to get your drug companies to change their prices.
iiiiiiitttttttttttt,fed57os,t1_fed55ma,1578999460.0,"Yeah I thought so too. I turned off spotlight then just got the same photo forever more. 

Tbf I should look into it a bit more before complaining."
iiiiiiitttttttttttt,fed4s84,t1_fecx53e,1578998844.0,Thi thing about win10 that very slightly bugs me is the lock screen messages. I like the random pics that are on the lock screen but don’t like the messages/psuedo ads that show on it. But I can’t work out how to have the former without the latter.
Greyhounds,fe6z0es,t1_fe6qdnb,1578907891.0,Oh wow I didn’t know. I’m surprised that a smaller country like Ireland has that many. Glad that there are families taking them in once they’re turfed from the industry tho =)
Greyhounds,fe6l5mm,t1_fe5t0of,1578894551.0,How come they’re from ireland? Genuinely curious; I’m assuming there are no local ones?
IdiotsInCars,fe1idi9,t1_fe0drt6,1578826799.0,ITTT has geofences triggers now? That’s awesome. I tried to set up something similar a while ago so my phone would text my wife when I was leaving work but I couldn’t figure it out.
battlestations,fe1epug,t1_fdyf214,1578825669.0,Not op but steel series have really thick mouse pads. I bought the XL for my work desk and I find it really comfortable.
Conservative,fdyzqhh,t1_fdyz2al,1578785258.0,He broke the FCPA of 1977 by ordering the withholding congress approved funds to Ukraine.
Conservative,fdyylq1,t1_fdtk2f2,1578784846.0,"Why would the trial exonerate trump tho, he broke the law?"
AdviceAnimals,fduk8qh,t1_fdqz95m,1578734211.0,Ok so that was like 400 years ago or something. Maybe update the system so you can vote on weekends?
AdviceAnimals,fdujqyl,t1_fdr4qqx,1578734121.0,"Australian here: are you saying that not only does America not get a day off to vote/hold elections on weekends, but you don’t have the choice to mail your vote in either? Dude, wtf. It’s like they don’t want you to vote or something."
gadgets,fdq947u,t1_fdq91v4,1578659844.0,"Ah yes of course. There’s definitely a difference between having the technology available, and making the technology available."
gadgets,fdq8yo6,t1_fdprcg0,1578659690.0,Wasn’t this done years ago? I remember some hacker doing a presentation on reducing malaria in Africa by taking servos and the laser out of a blu ray player and killing mosquitoes mid air.
BitchImATrain,fdoc4ov,t3_ema427,1578602494.0,"Hey, a TLM that actually works! Nice."
brisbane,fdjfhnl,t1_fdigzvb,1578468583.0,"Man I’ve reported tiny leaks near my place and they’ve been there the next day pulling apart the side walk. Same thing when my sewer backed up; they had a crew in my back yard within the hour. I’ve had really good experiences with them.

Edit: sorry, didn’t see this was unity water. I’ve dealt with urban utilities who were great. My apologies."
dataisbeautiful,fdgk5r9,t1_fdgi68d,1578400010.0,I’m a python guy (albeit extreme beginner) but you’re right. The customisation it offers you is amazing
dataisbeautiful,fdgk3lg,t1_fdgfe9y,1578399950.0,"Oh cool, that’s good to know. I still use excel for data crunching on the fly or if there’s smaller tasks but kinda moved on to sql/PowerBi a while ago. I like seeing excel appear on this sub, it was my intro to data."
dataisbeautiful,fdgdbgq,t1_fdgb73b,1578391309.0,"Wow excel graphing seems to have come along way, well done mate. Looks great!"
YouShouldKnow,fdgd3x9,t1_fcv7gs0,1578390998.0,Oh wow that’s really interesting! I’ve only used them exclusively but I like their phone app. Now I’m curious to see how other pw managers handle like haha.
YouShouldKnow,fdgd1t2,t1_fcu3xkh,1578390909.0,"That’s true, I did read that before going with them. I liked how they handled it tho and it was quite a few years ago. It’s good to let people know about tho so they can make an informed decision. Apologies for not including it in my recommendation."
AmItheAsshole,fdbpwi2,t1_fda129q,1578260082.0,"Sounds like you had a shit day care centre than a problem with the industry as a whole. Our daughter goes two days a week and it’s awesome for her. She’s 18 months old and already has two best friends, the activities they do are very stimulating to the point where shes so exhausted that actually sleeps better on the nights she goes. They also have the local library come in and read to them, cultural days for different days of importance, the police and fire department come in and do show-and-tells etc. It’s wild. 

She comes home knowing new words or activities; her development is very plain to see."
CatastrophicFailure,fd89w1q,t1_fcysesj,1578215650.0,"You’d think so. I’ve seen the cabs thrown clear of the engine tho. Depending on the type of derailment this, sometimes the first part of the train makes it over the defect and the derailment occurs midway. So the drivers would be safe in that instance."
AskReddit,fd50xat,t1_fd2wua9,1578173093.0,"I’ve been to Paris three times now, and by the third time you really start to see how dirty it is. It’s like they’ve never heard of pressure washing haha. I loved Nice though and would love to see some of the other places you mentioned. 

One other thing worth mentioning is before I left on each trip, everyone kept telling me the French were very rude. But I found that the opposite was true. I can only speak very broken French but the locals seemed to appreciate the effort."
LifeProTips,fd1hxz4,t1_fd060ia,1578131468.0,"My bank’s online portal doesn’t differentiate between lower and upper case letters in your password. It accepts both. 

Not sure how I feel about that."
Games,fcymubt,t1_fcx8kql,1578082974.0,"Thanks dude. I’ll have another look on Spotify; last time I checked, there’s only a fan made playlist for ac7 and it’s just 100 rock songs."
Games,fcx6wv1,t1_fc8sc39,1578053713.0,Apologies for the late comment: any idea where I can listen to it?
YouShouldKnow,fctvlhi,t1_fctrzd7,1577961798.0,"I really like LastPass. The features are great and they’ve recently made their premium accounts free. 

Their mobile app is easy to use, they let you know if you’ve reused any of your existing passwords across multiple accounts, their password generator is great and they periodically run your email address thru haveibeenpawned to alert you if you’ve appeared in the latest data breaches. 

I’m sure there are other good managers, lastpass is just what I landed on."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fcq2k2i,t1_fco7fyk,1577877346.0,Wait til you quietly automate their tasks with said spreadsheet.
13or30,fcpw00u,t1_fcobqji,1577873340.0,"Apparently They're Amish, who are known for sometimes having smaller gene pools due to their culture/religion etc. Hence the four boys looking rather unique yet similar."
IdiotsInCars,fcm1c8m,t1_fckzgae,1577761665.0,Would your insurance be affected if you were in an accident with temp tags on your vehicle?
StoriesAboutKevin,fcjl9z2,t1_fcgbc3n,1577692272.0,Definitely something akevin would think haha

worldnews,fcj5wse,t1_fchbh9i,1577678051.0,"Holy shit, any go can prescribe cannabinoid products, and then specially licenced gps can prescribe THC. I love it."
StoriesAboutKevin,fcipf2i,t1_fcfgseu,1577666696.0,"Ah, that makes sense. I’m Australian so we need a passport for any international flight"
Greyhounds,fci9eip,t3_eh8ocs,1577659352.0,"I wouldn’t recommend tinned food, if not because of the price and lack of control over the ingredients then because it’s gross to deal with haha. 

We use Blackhawk kibble, buy it online with free delivery. For dinner, we give hive equal parts rice, steamed veggies and either pet mince or chicken, whichever is cheapest at the butchers. Once you shop around, you’ll work out a routine that’s cheap and has high quality ingredients. Sunday is our cooking day and we create a week’s worth of meals in bulk. For snacks, look into what types of bones you can give them as you need to keep on top of oral hygiene.

One other thing worth mentioning if you’re adopting is to not give your grey any toys that have that tennis ball fur on them. Tennis balls obviously,  but I’ve seen it on other toys as well. The fur wears down their teeth and greys already Have shocking teeth. We found that hockey practice balls are great as they’re cheap, smooth and incredibly durable."

StoriesAboutKevin,fcfdjgv,t3_eh5lup,1577628926.0,That’s weird. I thought your passport info was required when you booked an international ticket.

MovieDetails,fc8mnjk,t1_fc8mk76,1577538048.0,Oh that's interesting to hear. It's been a while since I've seen the hobbit so I should check it out.

MovieDetails,fc7rvdm,t1_fc7nncd,1577517029.0,I just pirated it from memory. It was a few years ago but I think I searched ‘hobbit extended edit’ or something.
MovieDetails,fc7r4pr,t1_fc7qz52,1577516503.0,"You’re right, I think that’s what I’m thinking of. I just grabbed a copy of it off a torrent. I really liked it"
MovieDetails,fc7n4sy,t1_fc7n3hr,1577512980.0,I think he just did the hobbit. Not sure if he did the first three movies
MovieDetails,fc7n08t,t1_fc7lx9t,1577512843.0,"The edited version is pretty good. The guy from that 70s show took all three hobbit movies and cut them down to one, which is much truer to the books.

Edit: for those interested, it’s called the Tolkien Cut and is available via torrent I believe. Thank you u/ImportantLoLFacts"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fc73ucs,t1_fc62fjo,1577496812.0,"We use dish towels instead of wrapping paper for gifts to our family. They’re pretty cheap to buy and they can be used after the gift giving, over wrapping paper that tends to be thrown out. Plus it looks cool"

EverythingScience,fbzaj23,t1_fbyrq8l,1577240277.0,"There's a couple scenes in zero dark thirty that go into the various methods used to either narrow down the search or confirm a suspected location of bin Laden. From the movie, I believe the vaccination drive was **after** they suspected his compound. They were looking to match a blood sample or something. 

They also tried collecting waste samples from the sewage etc."

AskReddit,fbwswei,t1_fbv15dl,1577158550.0,"On this: I’m a track engineer. You’d be surprised how easy it is to get a big chuck of heavy rail to suit your blacksmith needs. If someone cold called one of our regional maintenance depots or similar, they’d be able to point you to the skip bin full of off cuts that you could help yourself to. 

I used to use off cuts in my garage as parking guides."
