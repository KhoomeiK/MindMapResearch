I mean, it’s very helpful, and I love that it has instructions for both left and right handed, among other things... but some of those photos and projects in it just crack me up! My mom found it in an eclectic hobby/education shop the other day and gave it to us. The boys found it very funny too which is why we included it in the photo. I love it! It’s my new ‘coffee table book’ for kicks and giggles!"
Brochet,ffb9jmh,t1_ffb62wv,1579756227.0,"Yeah! So we have looked at some online and in stores, and they’re really drawn to the books about amugurimi animals and like superheroes: my nephew is really interested in [Dragons, Unicorns, and More Fantasy Amigurumi](https://books.google.com/books/about/Unicorns_Dragons_and_More_Fantasy_Amigur.html?id=erzftQEACAAJ&source=kp_cover)  after seeing a post here on reddit of a unicorn (or maybe it was a funky llama - I can’t remember lol) with reference to the book for the pattern! I told him it’s one we could eventually get if he continues to practice, but if we can’t find it I’m sure any amigurmi critters will be a hit. My son hasn’t settled on a book of interest quite yet, but he’s wanting to make bags, totes and useful products eventually so we’ll probably get some with patterns geared towards those and books with techniques fancier stitches for those items in time. I’m not sure if there are books specifically for the kinds of totes or bags he has in mind yet, but he is planning on asking for recommendations from his Family & Consumer Sciences teacher (like home ec / textiles studies). I’m hopeful that there are some he can find suited to his interest though because I haven’t made these things myself - still very new as well. I am trying to learn how to read patterns so that I will be able to help them both when we do venture into using books for projects! So far the only one we have is a vintage (1975) Crochet book (cover shown in the pictures I’ve shared). It has some crazy designs, but it does cover the basic stitches well. It’s so funny though! My mother picked it up from an eclectic hobby/education store that she likes to visit. Anyway, sorry for rambling! I’m quite excited that there’s a plethora of resources out there for us to learn from, including this sub!"
Brochet,ffb86cq,t1_ffb4230,1579754648.0,"That denim ombré is D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S isn’t it?! It reminds me of warm fires and home cooked meals... totally cozy! I’m still in awe that such a sweet someone felt so inspired to gift it to him! I love wrist warmers, and I’m sure your daughter will too!"
Brochet,ffb80fl,t1_ffb3xup,1579754498.0,"Thank you so much! I am gushing with love for comments from people like you, it’s been a pleasure to share and to be thought of so warmly. They will definitely have fun creating, as this sub has so many amazing ideas that they love to admire. Its been great."
Brochet,ffb7u3y,t1_ffb053g,1579754318.0,That’s wonderful! I hope that your niece and nephew are receptive to your lessons. They can really take off and blossom if they stick with it!
Brochet,ffb7pp1,t1_ffaz2s7,1579754185.0,It really is! I was shown what yarns would be coming but I was still blown away - vintage and specialty yarns that are just so soft and pretty! I know they’ll make great use of it and have so much fun in the process.

Brochet,ffb7kob,t1_ffawpk1,1579754033.0,"They bring me so much joy, but sharing their newfound love for this really makes me happy too. I haven’t experienced such compassionate people sharing an interest such as this before. I’m grateful. And actually sobbing over here about all these kind comments from people such as you and I’m so glad! Thank you!!"
crochet,ffb7dqt,t1_ffb78ky,1579753834.0,"It really is! I was very impressed that his teacher was not only receptive to the idea, but openly encouraged it too. Crocheters are the best!"
crochet,ffb78fs,t1_ffb20es,1579753691.0,I would love to! Thank you. My sister (nephew’s mom) asked me to give him little classes once a week but there has been some difficult my working out a schedule so for now we’re just working on practicing stitches. They’ve only been at it for about a month! Hopefully when we get a schedule worked out where I have more one on one time they can accomplish a lot more. I’ll be sure to post their works too!
crochet,ffb70wd,t1_ffax641,1579753508.0,"Thank you, and I certainly will! I absolutely agree! After I taught my nephew how to do slipknots and chains, he went to school and told his teacher that he knew how to crochet. She told him that she crochets too, and invited him to bring some supplies to class so that he could work on it when he finishes his schoolwork or needs to calm. I thought that was so awesome! He even went on to show his friends and classmates how to do it, so a few more have joined the hobby too. I’m very proud. :”}"

crochet,ffaqaq4,t3_eslgzf,1579741982.0,"Hi! I’m in Utah. I learned a basic chain and single crochet as a teenager from one of my sisters, but didn’t progress from there. My mother also crochets with the basics but she never had the patience to teach me more than what my sister did. I started up again on Thanksgiving Day last year and have been at it since! I think it’s a great idea to get a general consensus of where other members of the sub are from! Crochet is a global skill, after all? Isn’t it? It is, right? (Someone, tell us!) anyway, this sub is so supportive and creative and I love it! Welcome!"
EverythingScience,ffa3cef,t3_eshz9y,1579727060.0,"Given that I’ve lived with this condition (partial) due to medical condition and subsequent procedures for quite a long time (and have family members who do too), the results of this limited study don’t surprise me at all.  Thank you for posting it though, as I wasn’t aware that there are non-profits dedicated to those of us who live with ‘nose-blindness’ and/or ‘olfactory hallucinations’.

I believe she has a Playlist of beginners videos. Hope this is helpful to you!"

houseplants,ff8k9pj,t3_es985y,1579682489.0,"They don’t look as neglected or unhealthy as you think (they’re beautiful in fact!) and many plants are more resilient than we credit them for. They’ll probably look more grateful to have this soak, but you’re doing just fine with them. Sometimes caring for plants is in itself a method of caring for ourselves and the important matters in our lives, too. Kudos to you for doing that!"
whatsthisplant,ff8c2fz,t1_ff855dz,1579672458.0,"Well, they do get big, several inches as you said. Some as up to 6” across. If the photo you’ve posted isn’t from the event you mentioned, perhaps you’re recalling a different flower with a somewhat similar appearance but a lot smaller. Something like Gomphrenas? They kind of have a spiky flower look like hops and are quite small by comparison: I’m really not sure though and I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help in your quest."
Aquariums,ff7xojr,t3_es5ihl,1579660819.0,"Standard LED household bulbs are fine for temporary use to keep a diurnal cycle in place and sustain low tech plants. I’ve used one for many years on my 10g. Of course, stronger lighting is best for most real aquatic plants. Remember to keep the bulb about 3” away from the glass minimum, and to place the electrical outlet out of range of drips or flooding. Other than that, its fine."

They’re not finicky and you should see roots within a month of you’re patient and consistent."
whatsthisplant,ff7gsul,t1_ff7fc4t,1579649206.0,"I don’t mean to be contrary, but they really are Blushing Bride Protea buds. They start out pink and as they age they begin to turn white. In this photo they are not in full bloom yet. If they had been allowed to continue growing the blossoms would continue to open and expand in size.

EatCheapAndHealthy,ff4od37,t1_ff4m9b8,1579568517.0,"Yep! For whatever reason my body has difficulty processing iron and iron supplements so I’m always ‘borderline anemic,’ yet cream of wheat keeps me from becoming fully anemic. If I didn’t have this issue personally, I probably wouldn’t have known the benefit of it as a great source of iron either. Also have no clue why I can process it from cream of wheat but not many other iron-rich foods. It’s odd, but it works!

As for seeds, if you still want to use fruits, pressing them through a sieve should sort that out. Alternatively, you can purchase freeze dried fruits and they can be powdered to add into your foods or you can allow them to rehydrate for something mushier; I haven’t encountered freeze dried fruits that contain seeds yet."
yarntrolls,ff4jmau,t1_ff4imih,1579565200.0,Baffling seems to be putting it very nicely! LoL It’s equally atrocious and hilarious!
EatCheapAndHealthy,ff4j44h,t3_erlz1a,1579564841.0,"Cream of wheat once daily should cover you for your concern about anemia; it has a sufficient amount of iron for most adults. 

Some other ideas you can try: Refried beans (add sour cream or extra broth to give it the consistency for your personal need), summer squash soup, pumpkin purée (mix in crushed graham crackers if you can stomach it after they absorb the pumpkin), mashed yams and carrots seasoned to your liking, mashed cauliflower (add a small dab of bacon grease and finely minced chives for a tasty boost), Onions can be puréed for French onion soup, queso over twice baked potatos, dumpling soup (you can use whatever broth you like, make the dumplings very small, and chew well if you’re confident you can stomach it), broccoli and cheese soup (purée or mash the broccoli if needed), peanut butter banana protein shakes, mash up strawberries, blueberries, peaches or figs to mix into oatmeal, creamed corn, and that’s about all I’ve got off the top of my mind. I hope some of these are helpful for you, and I wish you a speedy recovery!"

Meditation,fel93ey,t3_epqzyv,1579216737.0,"Yes, so this is an optical phenomenon where the color changing effect of blue (or sometimes other colors of bright red, pale purple, or a filmy green) is caused by the light penetrating the retina (yes, even through our eyelids) for an extended period and it basically causes a disturbance in the receptors that transmit the colors and images through our optic nerve. It can cause that ‘filtered’ sensation and it can also cause retinal imprinting, which is when the basic outline of an image is temporarily seen as a hazy overlay on whatever we look at. I think the latter is a little more common. The important thing to remember is not to do this frequently or for extended periods without protective eyewear (sunglasses or shade of some kind) because even through our eyelids the strength of the sun can cause irreparable damage to our vision. Just a friendly caution to you! 
Facing certain directions isn’t necessary to meditate, but it can be very helpful to some. Having an object or image, such as the sun, to focus on (carefully, and again, with protective lenses) is also ritualistic, which is in part why some religions practice this. It all comes down to personal preference. It’s good to hear that you enjoyed your experience facing the sun."
Aquariums,fel7dpc,t3_epr024,1579215648.0,"I only remove algae if it’s on the front pane of glass or on the glass where the light sits, to ensure that the algae isn’t blocking light from reaching plants or the view looking in. I dont think of algae as being ‘dirty’ and I tend to like the look of it - more natural. If it’s not causing harm to the stock it also seems an awful waste of time to me. All that said, to each their own! I think it’s perfectly fine to remove it if that’s more aesthetically pleasing to you."
succulents,fel6c8d,t3_epr0sg,1579215005.0,"Yep, these are scales. They need to be treated with insecticides. Like other succulent and cactus pests, they will eat away at the plant until it’s decimated if left untreated."

houseplants,fei492f,t3_epa5bq,1579129941.0,"Aporocactus flagelliformis - Rat Tail Cactus (possibly a mini). They are quite prolific when cared for well. They’re epiphytes so they’re used to hanging around and climbing trees and such while preferring bright yet indirect sunlight. Spines are very thin and can easily irritate skin for weeks on end, so be very careful and use gloves. Should not be around pets or chikdren for that reason. This one looks like it’s gone without enough water for quite a while."
Aquariums,feh387v,t3_ep4sx8,1579108220.0,"Gradually drop the temp to about 72. This will slow the metabolism and lower their natural aggression as they recover. Take care to salt the tank appropriately and hardness is accurate for Africans. Make sure they have plenty of rocky hiding places to reduce stress, allowing them to hide and heal. Any fin rot medication or treatment should do fine. You don’t need to remove carbon for herbal treatments such as melafix, however if you choose to treat with a medication you should take out the cartridge for assurance that the medication will be in full effect (esp since you’re certain there’s carbon or not). Healthy fish do respond well to melafix, but fish that are suffering from internal infections might not respond to it at all. Frequent 30% water changes over the next two weeks, and make sure that your filters are maintaining good beneficial bacteria, so clean them carefully with excess aquarium water if you haven’t recently. Should be fully healed within 4-5 weeks depending on how vigilant you are with your chosen treatment. Fin rot isn’t a death sentence. You can do this!"

I really love this hobby and think anyone could benefit if they stuck with it."

bonecollecting,fea2ltp,t3_eo8pym,1578943763.0,Supposedly purple acid phosphate (an enzyme that creates a pinkish-purple hue) can cause this. I’d guess it’s reversible with some sort of alkaline treatment. Hope this helps in your search for answers.
crochet,fe9dd63,t1_fe98k4v,1578936566.0,"Gosh, that hadn’t crossed my mind. That’s terrible. It was very frustrating, but at least I was able to salvage it. It’s good to hear that you haven’t had too much trouble with this brand. Do you think there is some way to check that the innards are not tangled this way, without ruining the skein for someone else?"
Awwducational,fe5xsha,t1_fe5x9mr,1578877323.0,"That’s cool! figured they’re related as mollusks but I wasn’t sure if they’re classified as both snails. That’s great to know! I grow freshwater and brackish snails, and that’s where my username comes from, but I know very little about saltwater ones. Learning new things all the time!"

So I recently took up crocheting at the end of November again after over a decade of not doing it. Back when I had first learned to crocheted for a short while I only knew how to do single stitches and I was becoming a mother so I decided to make a baby blanket: the most frustrating part was trying to create a simple scalloped border. Haha! I kept miscounting and twisting where I shouldn’t and ended up frogging the whole blanket in anger. I later made another, but soon put the hobby aside after that. I’ve since learned that frogging is just an opportunity to begin again and even frogged stuff builds up our skills. I’m happy that it’s back in my life again and that there’s a community here on Reddit to share the adventures in learning with!"
crochet,fe5ieh3,t3_ensx1h,1578869838.0,Excellent! Isn’t it awesome how fast it is to pick up and create something useful? That’s not to say it’s easy though. The scrunchies look great! I didn’t even know we could make scrunchies from crochet. Haha

For snails, it’s called a foot! I wonder if it’s also called a foot for conches."
crochet,fe4kvke,t1_fe2mhe5,1578860399.0,"So these kinds of cotton washcloths are very absorbant. More than terry cloth ones you might find in a store and probably more so than the average kitchen sponge. They’re great for sopping up spills, wiping counters, doing a quick dishes that have been pre-rinsed, so they can do the work of a sponge if that’s your preference. These can also be used as personal washcloths, though I strongly recommend differentiating the ones you may use for that versus household cleaning. The textures in the crochet are great for scrubbing or exfoliating. I’ve used the personal washcloths dipped in ice water to bring fevers down. They’re very versatile. They do require rinsing and wringing out well between use and should be washed frequently to avoid mildew and other bacteria from taking hold. Always lay them flat or hang them to get the most air to surface for quicker evaporation. In dry air climates you may get away with an extra day or two between washings compared to humid climates, and obviously depending on what it was used for or how heavily soiled it is. 

I tend to wash mine with hot water and a small amount of bleach in a small load, then they go into the dryer on high heat or out on the line to sunbleach in the warmer months. I’m not sure if others treat theirs the same way, but I can be a bit germaphobic so this is the care I take to keep them as santitary and sterile as possible. The colors do tend to fade over time due to this process, but that’s the least of my cares, ya know? I love that they can hold up to the harshness of everyday use for many years with proper cleanings in between."
crochet,fe4fu5h,t1_fe2m9f4,1578858821.0,"This was new to me as well, but it was simple enough that I was able to manage the first one with short pauses to the video, then the other two I didn’t need any assistance. Definitely one I recommend trying, as you’ll probably like your own results too. Thank you so much for the compliment!"

painting,fe30q47,t3_enopdw,1578844793.0,"300! Wow! 

My concepts are often inspired by two things: dreams / daydreams, and other people. 

Don’t be afraid to stretch it into abstracts when it comes to conveying your dreams. It might seem strange, but when the inspiration strikes you have to roll with it. It’s worth it! You’ll learn a lot about yourself and what it is to ‘make art’ if you temporarily let go of the tutorials and the realism and the concerns. Get messy. Then go on to Ask people what they’re reminded of when they look at it. You’ll come to find that a lot of people will be able to relate to it in ways you might not have considered during the process of creating it. Always consider the viewer’s interpretation in the process, but never take it seriously because to do so would be assumptive. Speculate only. Be brave. 

When you’re stuck on what to paint, turning to other people is a fantastic way to exercise your imagination. All of this mist be done with permission, of course, but it yields great results in my own experiences. Ask for as many details as they care to give of what they would like to see in a painting. Allow them to choose some colors if they’re able and willing, and listen intently to their ideas for cues that you’ll remember as you progress. Take notes if it helps you. Then reach within to ask yourself how to best translate their version of thought into a visual rendering. Nothing has to be precise, it just needs to be an honest effort. Expell your doubts and just trust in other people and their desire to see you succeed will get you through this one and on to the next! 

In addition to the ‘other people’ I think it’s also important to glean ideas from Masters of study in the past. They paved the way for artists of our day, so honoring them with some studies geared towards their techniques or methods can really broaden your abilities. 

I hope you find this somewhat helpful, and I wish you the best in your painting adventures!"
