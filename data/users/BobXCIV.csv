Languages constantly evolve. Inuktitut is no exception. English isn't anymore evolved than than Inuktitut. Also, saying that no one is forcing its extinction is also r/badhistory; Inuktitut speakers were forced into boarding schools just like other indigenous North Americans.

There are no such things as ""subpar"" languages. Languages hold many cultural aspects whose purpose is more than ""representing"" the world; Inuktitut represented the Inuits' world. Also, English isn't used by everyone in the world. It's not even the most spoken language by native speakers.
