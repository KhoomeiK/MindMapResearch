iamverysmart,fedrdj4,t1_fedlgoz,1579018248.0,I'm pretty sure you just made this up. Psychopathy and sociopathy aren't even legitimate disorders recognized in the DSM. It's just kind of a buzz word.
SelfAwarewolves,fedqyvt,t1_fedp7gy,1579017994.0,What are you even talking about? Do you think immigrants are just leaving their babies at the border en masse and the United States is graciously providing them housing and food?

AskReddit,fecv616,t1_fectbe2,1578985882.0,"That's what I'm thinking. A bachelors and a masters degree in literally anything, let alone something medicine related, opens up so many more options than 7/11. Honestly, a high school degree will probably open up more options than 7/11 lol"

oddlysatisfying,fcxb2my,t1_fcx8a4d,1578057917.0,"Why on Earth would someone want to work at McDonalds when they have other options? See, this is what people don't understand. A job at McDonalds sucks. It's hot, its loud, and everyone's rude to you. You have to a deal with shitty bosses and customers who don't treat you like a human being. It's not a fun job that anyone with other options would take OVER those other options. This is just a foolish statement you made."
