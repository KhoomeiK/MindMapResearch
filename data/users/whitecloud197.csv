It's not just ""Especially"" Rural Areas. Edmonton and Calgary run out of available ambulances several times a day. An issue that AHS calls ""Code Red""

AHS instead is now pulling ambulances off the road due to being unable to staff them as they wont pay to have the spot filled. EMS is already severely short handed and it's now even more so.
