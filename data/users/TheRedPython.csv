I contacted shelters in rural areas since the city shelters did not have anything like what we were wanting, kept looking on petfinder and shelter websites, etc until we were settled into our new place and ready to bring a dog home. Two that I had been eyeing about 3 hours from my city ended up being adopted a few days before we were going to travel out to meet them, but then a closer town posted a BC mix on their website and I met and adopted her the very next day.

All of the other dogs in that shelter were pits except mine and the cattle dog mix she was brought in with as a stray. I met her within a couple of days of being released from stray hold, if I didn't get her I bet someone else that week or even day would have.

rarepuppers,ff5gtpl,t1_ff5exfs,1579592247.0,"First of all, like my post said, I did adopt.

I don't work full time, I have no children, I have no dependents. This is not the case for the vast majority of dog-hopeful households. I have time to work on my high-maintenance herding dog and she is coming along beautifully.

I have no illusions about most families fitting this bill. I have no illusions that simply adopting all of the dogs will fix the problem. Backyard breeders and puppy mill litters who don't sell are always ending up at shelters and rescues, it's their backup plan. They have a win/win: they can make money off of dogs without having to deal with their excess ""inventory."" Yeah, it's a problem that shelters and rescues can be complicit within.

I don't see the situation as black/white as you do; I think it's good for people to adopt who are prepared to deal with the risk that comes along with it (like I did). I don't think it's feasible for every family, by any stretch. When I grew up our first dog was a \*stray\* so you aren't speaking to someone who is against giving a dog a chance. I have also seen what happens when an ill-placed adoption goes wrong. There's no shortage of shelters who just hand a dog over without checking or asking for references, landlord permission, etc. I came to the Humane Society with mine ready but they didn't even ask for them. My dog was just lucky that I had minded my 'p's & 'q's. How is this a good practice for a dog? What if I had gotten a reactive Shepherd mix in a multi-family environment without having read about dog training/behavior? That dog would end up dead anyway, and someone's kid might not have all of its fingers after all is said and done.

If you have children or handicapped elders and want a large dog, or can't deal with the possibility that your dog may come down with a genetic issue when it's only 3 years old later down the road which could cost thousands, if not tens of thousands to fix, then yeah I do think a well-bred dog is a better option. Reputable breeders stick with you and help you and have resources that most shelters and rescues can't give. I also think that if you want a \*puppy\* that's a better option. Dog abortions exist, I'm tired of seeing rescues and shelters allowing pregnant surrenders/strays give birth. That adds to the problem with puppies of unknown health/temperament issues and also takes away from other dogs getting adopted out of the same shelter, not to mention resources.

I live in a community rife with loose, feral and stray dogs, recycling them back into the community often doesn't serve anyone well. There are also some dogs that are plain un-adoptable to all but the most seasoned trainers and those are few and far between. Basic obedience only goes so far with dogs who have already been abused or badly trained if you have a person unable to commit to that much training consistently. Most dog owners that I observe are not up to that task.

I wanted a companion and I did my homework. I know a lot of people who have gone out and adopted and their dogs thinking all dogs are the same and their dogs ended up attacking someone, having so many special needs that the owner couldn't live their life happily,  with the dog living a miserable existence with an owner who works 60 hrs/week and should have gotten a cat instead (that dog ended up being 1 strike away from mandatory euthanizing per the city \*after\* my friend adopted it from the shelter), or killing a beloved cat. This is the side of ""adopt don't shop"" that no one talks about. No ethical breeder would have adopted those dogs to those people. Shelters and sometimes rescues fail to see the bigger picture out of a desire to ""save them all."" It's noble, sometimes it works, but sometimes it causes more harm than good. This issue is far more nuanced than ""rescue good/breeders bad"""
rarepuppers,ff5dhtk,t1_ff4qdmr,1579588331.0,"The fact that you think death is the worst scenario tells me a lot about how shallow your perspective for ""empathy"" is. There are fates worse than euthanizing, such as ending up in a constant adoption-and-surrender cycle, or being warehoused in a no-kill shelter indefinitely because of behavioral/neurological/health issues that hardly any potential adopters can manage.

It would be better for those who can afford it get vetted by and purchase through reputable breeders so the backyard breeders can go bust and the need for shelters/rescues can be diminished to a greater extent.

I won't even entertain your ""all purebreeds have health issues"" claim.

Said there was ""no way"" NYC could ever be safer than the midwest...ok, boomer"

I would commute by bus every single day except during really bad weather if they just did this since I live and work along a route, but my shifts either begin or end during mid-day so I can't take it both ways. I say this as someone with a well-working car, even."

I'm a Millennial myself but it was jolting to me when I moved away from a job I'd had for much of my 20s and had to navigate this difference while settling into a new place. Not being able to easily follow up on an application/resume was really unnerving to me. I have since only worked for small, local businesses which has been its own double edged sword but at this point I don't think I want to deal with corporate businesses ever again if I can help it."

CreepyWikipedia,fcwo3ug,t3_ej1lvi,1578031275.0,"I had no idea of this. My great grandparents came from this part of modern day Ukraine but left at the dawn of WWI, my great-grandfather was Polish from near here. I wonder if he lost some relatives in this way or if they all managed to leave before WWII. He refused to learn English so there was little communication between him and his non-Polish speaking grandchildren for stories to pass down and my great-grandmother wasn't fond of talking of the Old Country it seems.

Also had no idea that Ukrainians and Poles had such animosity toward each other back then."
CreepyWikipedia,fcwnuu5,t1_fcv5gfv,1578031042.0,Was this some kind of relatively common torture during WWII? I read a similar account in The Fall of Berlin but I believe it was from a different massacre elsewhere.
kansascity,fcwln5q,t1_fcwarhy,1578029087.0,"The better quality of life in those cities has less to do with putting up more luxury highrises, Whole Foods/semi-upscale dining/shopping and more to do with a liberal voting base tbh. Nobody wants to live in the midwest because it's up-and-coming, ever at any point in history, but instead because it's more practical and affordable generally. Make the city exclusive to mid and high level earners only and this city isn't going to work out as hoped."

Sadly, I think this is one of those that may never be resolved no matter what kind of technology advancements come.

Colorado, Nebraska & Kansas are always fighting over the Aquifer and who owes who water, who's using too much, etc and maybe one of these states, or even Kansas, is employing this technique. If one state is currently disputing and considering a lawsuit about it then it could even be a private company hired conducting this.

I did find this article from earlier this year about testing drones for a similar purpose, so the technology may be there [https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/integration-suas-hydrogeophysical-studies?qt-science\_center\_objects=0#qt-science\_center\_objects](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/integration-suas-hydrogeophysical-studies?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)"

dogs,fccdm79,t3_egagg0,1577597192.0,"I got a 10 month old BC/Lab from the Humane Society earlier this month. They said she had no prior training, had severe anxiety, etc. Much of that was true. She was previously somehow crate trained, we learned when she decided to show us, which has made a big difference for us. She was (and still is) afraid of the stairs to the point where she won't come down, and we are on the 2nd floor. She has mastered 4 tricks, no longer ""anxiety pees"" and has gotten comfortable with our balcony and the few times I've managed to get her downstairs (carrying her) she has displayed great progress with leash manners, in on-leash parks and on trails. She was terrified of the car but after only her 2nd trip into the world she has figured out how to get in and out of the car with little to no prodding from me--although she still finds the movement in the car kind of scary. For a high-energy teenage puppy, she has come so far. She has also finally figured out to potty on the potty pads we have in the kitchen, FINALLY. If you wonder how we keep her exercised, our apartment has some open spaces that lend well to fetch and we do a lot of training for mental stimulation. She gets tired before we do. She sleeps like a dream in her crate and is happy to go there when I have to leave the apartment, too. Over the last few weeks she has demonstrated some incredible progress, though, with many of her fears. She wouldn't go near the balcony or the stairwell, now she enjoys the balcony and loves to ""train"" on the stairs. She now will go halfway down. Once we have her down the stairs when it's time to go up she does so on her own. When I first brought her home I ended up having to carry her up."
BanPitBulls,fc933vp,t1_fc8d4ye,1577546245.0,"It wasn't so much as outright mistreatment from the WWII vets so much as a coldness and a sense of disappointment and abandonment, or so my dad explained it to me, and within some families it was pretty brutal for the returning vets from their own parents/grandparents. It was complicated and they did not receive the fanfare of their elders when they returned (for reasons that I think are understandable--but I can see why many vets were bitter about it all the same).

And about Boomer's parents--the WWII vets, largely--many Boomers experienced abuse or abandonment from their veteran parents whose PTSD was not any more appropriately addressed than the Vietnam Vets' was."
BanPitBulls,fc7jnce,t1_fc7gjhq,1577509542.0,"I'm not usually one to defend Boomers but the Boomers who fought in Vietnam were not received very warmly by the WWII vets at the time.

It means that any assets that they accrue over their lives will be held against this action until the debt is paid. It cannot make them homeless and if they have no bank account then they can't be collected upon. Even if they do have an account it will depend on the local laws/lawyers to determine how to collect from there."
