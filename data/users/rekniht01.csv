As for weather sealing, that's a bit more complicated. Since weather sealing is not part of the mft standard no manufacturer will verify cross brand sealing. And no independent testing has ever been thoroughly done, at least as I am aware of. What this means as a consumer is that there is no way to know for certain. Many users have no issue with cross brand sealing, others only trust same brand sealing. It is really up to you to decide. I will say that Olympus sealing is absolutely at or near the top when it comes to weather sealing. So if that is an absolute necessity in your shooting, you can't do worse than an Olympus body and Olympus lens."

On the other hand, the OPs story seems really one sided. That has me thinking there is more trouble in this relationship than just pregnancy hormones. So maybe ESH.

Yes, she is the AH. She seems to have taken the opportunity of the move to check out of the marriage. Not being honest about that to you and the kids is definitely AH material.

What gives me pause is OP's language. "" I told her... it needed to stop."" "" I told her we need to move back...""  Is that really the how it went down? That's pretty controlling AH language, even in this post that is looking for validation of responding to shitty behavior. That tells me that there were probably issues with this relationship prior to the move. Which goes a long way to explaining the shitty things she started doing when the opportunity presented itself.

If you want to continue this relationship you both need to be honest with each other, probably in a room with a therapist. But honestly, I think it is past that point. Good luck.
