SuicideWatch,fez72pv,t1_fez653o,1579454426.0,"Thanks so much, I didn’t think someone would actually talk with me. I’ll have a think about it. I’m not sure about anything but you’ve helped me relieve a bit of stress that I was piling up, unable to tell anyone."
SuicideWatch,fez4wg6,t1_fez2q5w,1579453891.0,I don’t know. I just don’t think I can make it through these couple years of my life. And honestly I think the thing stopping me from suicide is me wanting to explore a little and make my life better as you said. But I see no hope currently. It’s like I’m in some pitch dark cave with no light or hope. Another thing I’m struggling with is coming out to my friends and family that I’m gay. I haven’t been able to do that either for many years now. I just can’t see a future in myself.
SuicideWatch,feyylnf,t1_feyxfbd,1579452066.0,It always seems like just not being here anymore is the easier option. You can avoid doing all the difficult things and hard times. I know that means that I’ll also not be able to have good times and happy days but it just doesn’t seem worth it. Just feels like the bad over weighs the good and just doesn’t add up. That being said I can’t build the courage to actually make a move so now I gotta get through this school year with good grades and the means to do that is to act normal and get through every day like a normal person and study hard.
SuicideWatch,feywf6y,t1_feyv8z3,1579451332.0,"Another reason I’m struggling to see a doctor is my family’s reaction and a highly important year of school. I feel like if I seek professional support, I could be effected somehow in school and perhaps be forced to take days off or something which I can’t afford to do. I’ve always been planning to take my life before school starts in 2020 as I’ve been stressing quite a lot over this upcoming school year. But obviously I haven’t been able to and honestly I’m too scared to."
SuicideWatch,feys780,t3_eqgy8d,1579449949.0,I’ve thought the same so many times. Strange

askgaybros,fcwwi7q,t3_ejadtb,1578040584.0,I’m 16 and gay and tbh I wouldn’t want for you to tell me. I’d be hella embarrassed. You should probably just leave it and sometimes give subtle hints to your son that you accept homosexuality and you support it. Would help him to come out to you when he’s most comfortable.
