I think what you guys are doing is great though. Knowledge and ideas should never be suppressed no matter how out there they may be. They should be brought to the forefront of our discussions so they can be dissected in a constructive and meaningful way, and you guys seem to be starting on that. There may just be hope for all of us."

However, it seems that QAnon and Trump supporters purposefully go out of their way to remain as ignorant as possible. They have all the information they need to see the truth but they would rather continue pretending that they’re right and their “great leader” will rescue them. I have no sympathy for them because ideas like theirs are cancerous. They risk our future by allowing these asinine ideas to continue spreading."

Oh and I do recall that when the women would leave the men’s room the zombies would...umm....check to make sure a deposit had been made.

wowthanksimcured,ffy4ypn,t1_ffxov45,1580338639.0,True but you also have to remember that your inner baby only knows how to communicate with drama. Babies are always all or nothing so you have to learn to take it in stride. And you can definitely reach a point where you can push through some discomfort but it takes time and knowing yourself very well.
