Hit a block going up, the next one will probably be the opposite direction, down.

Hit a block going right, the next one will probably be the opposite direction, left.

Obviously it isn't true for everything, but many levels on E+ just do this. The diagonals mess it up but I basically don't even go diagonally, it just goes along.

This song is rather tedious because of the switching of the sides. So you go from hitting light speed blocks and suddenly you need to bring your arms to the other side and then back again in a quarter of a second. Just keep practicing and get the muscle memory down. It's far easier to play an expert+ track you've played 10 times than an expert+ track you've never played."

Channel that energy into Iowa if you want him to win!"
JoeBiden,feb53nc,t1_feb3pvd,1578955501.0,"I do hope he does well in Iowa still, I've been with the campaign since it started but even I must accept that the end may be near, sad to say. :(

If anything, I hope Yang runs in 2024 if he doesn't secure 2020, his online base will only grow further and the effects of automation will be taking place.

Although yeah, I hope Yang does take any spot with Biden, it would give him great experience and get his ideas pushed straight to the federal view."
JoeBiden,feb2hc2,t1_feax9g4,1578954858.0,"Thank you for the warm welcome!

Because of the misleading Hillary > Trump polls from before the election, I'm still skeptical at any polls pertaining to the general election, however it is clear to see Biden would pull a lot of Dems in to vote and Biden has a fairly strong stance against Trump. I'm sure he would do well!

As mentioned in another thread, I like his experience number. Experience doesn't equate to electability but it sure does add a ton of credibility!"
JoeBiden,feb20ul,t1_feawhu5,1578954723.0,"IIRC Yang only went in for the presidential slot, I don't think he cares for a cabinet/vp slot. However I would LOVE if Biden brought yang on in some way, Yang knows lots about nuclear power and I think UBI would be interesting if brought into the public eye."
JoeBiden,feb1pnc,t1_feaw05v,1578954598.0,"Yep. I'm in a fairly rural area in Minnesota. I know a LOT of trump supporters, one thing's for sure - they all have an innate hatred for Bernie. I'm not kidding, I haven't met one trump supporter that would vote for sanders at all. The Bernie supporters saying that Bernie would pull trump supporters are the same people who have only ever talked to people in their own political bubble. Biden doesnt really attract my MAGA friends, but they don't despise him like they do Bernie.

That's why I'm ready to give my support to Biden. If Warren or Sanders gets that nomination I am confident trump will stay until 2025, they stand no chance."
JoeBiden,feain5v,t1_feahfu6,1578949266.0,"Experience cannot be downplayed, I didn't know he has served the public that long! Will be hard for Trump to knock him on that.

Compromisation is great in this divided political climate, that's for sure. Imo, Biden does seem like the most neutral of all Democratic candidates, it's synonymous to most stable for me.

Hopefully he will be able to pull more from the red and swing it in his favor."

Just goes to show though - these animals are rather intelligent compared to most other animals. Many gorillas can also show signs of bonding, empathy, and genuine remorse over humans and their deaths. [This is a stunning example](https://youtu.be/uUb1ZWzZBHs) of Koko the gorilla, a gorilla capable of basic sign language, mourning Robin Williams after his passing. Truly beautiful creatures!"

YangForPresidentHQ,fdu1u3i,t3_emte2d,1578726013.0,The amount of annoying fucking downplaying of yang and condescending behavior I've gotten from Bernie supporters has ruined any chance of me supporting him. Their bitterness from 2016 is alive and more dangerous to Bernie's campaign than ever.
AskReddit,fdrvooa,t1_fdrsu1g,1578690410.0,Is no one allowed to type a link? What if someone is referencing a 100% digital store? Chewy could get branded as a brick and mortar store to those unaware if the .com isn't there.

My name is Austendo on YouTube, I do videos on my opinions of gaming subjects. Although it's a fairly new style so I'm still getting used to it. 

I think I'm doing fairly well for myself in this crazy marathon. I had an older YouTube channel and got over 1k but lost it once I stopped uploading for no apparent reason. This was 3 years ago.

With the help of some friends I got a little following that helped me out. I admittedly did a *liiiittle* bit of self promo on Reddit but I didn't keep it up for very long, it can get annoying.

My first vid in this new style (I consider this the freshest start) was August of 2019. Second vid was November 2019. I plan on getting my third vid out very soon, since I found a way for my editing software to not be complete garbo lol.

Since then I've amassed 80 something subs, although I don't really care for my sub count anymore. I focused too much on that years ago and I think it drained me so now my mentality is ""who cares if I lose a subscriber, I have a relatively high amount already and I should be happy with that.""

My two videos though have been ridiculously successful. Even though my last upload was in November, and I only have 2 vids, the last 28 days gave me over 100 views which is crazy. Only 2 days in those 28 have there been 0 views. It's an odd feeling. They're both above 200 and the newest one is leading at 250. Pretty interesting to watch.

I think I'm doing very well on the marathon. I know the content I like doing, I like my editing and having fun, and I like my mentality on the whole thing, I feel a lot more grounded.

If you want a link to my newest vid I can share, I recommend it over my first one since I really liked the editing style at that point and got used to it."
PresidentialRaceMemes,fdl6wst,t1_fdl5yh1,1578518071.0,"Clear to see how open minded you are considering you are harsh, sarcastic, and abrasive when I simply called out a contradiction you have made, and then you add onto it with a generalization and an insult.

I'm not gonna provoke you any further but you're a good example of a terrible political standpoint. Good luck in life!"
PresidentialRaceMemes,fdl46j9,t1_fdkw2bj,1578516751.0,I mean... I wouldn't expect Bernie supporters to defend capitalism because that's not what they're on about. Why are you expecting us to condemn our own economic idea?

Weather also sounds fantastic! I would give anything to not live in this crazy area for temperature. I'll see if I can visit sometime, perhaps even stay if I like it - wouldn't be too spendy I'd say. Thanks for the realistic info though, it's better to hear honest thoughts and it really doesn't sound too bad. As for politics... I think we've got it quite bad here ha, not much can be worse"
