AskReddit,ffeaq8x,t3_et0g8b,1579841474.0,"*My family poops big. Maybe it's genetic, maybe it's our diet, but everyone births giant logs of crap. If anyone has laid a mega-poop, you know that sometimes it won't flush. It lays across the hole in the bottom of the bowl and the vortex of draining water merely gives it a spin as it mocks you.
Growing up, this was a common enough occurrence that our family had a poop knife. It was an old rusty kitchen knife that hung on a nail in the laundry room, only to be used for that purpose. It was normal to walk through the hallway and have someone call out ""hey, can you get me the poop knife""?
I thought it was standard kit. You have your plunger, your toilet brush, and your poop knife.Fast forward to 22. It's been a day or two between poops and I'm over at my friend's house. My friend was the local dealer and always had 'guests' over, because you can't buy weed without sitting on your ass and sampling it for an hour. I excuse myself and lay a gigantic turd. I look down and see that it's a sideways one, so I crack the door and call out for my friend. He arrives and I ask him for his poop knife.
""My what?""
Your poop knife, I say. I need to use it. Please.
""Wtf is a poop knife?""
Obviously he has one, but maybe he calls it by a more delicate name. A fecal cleaver? A Dung divider? A guano glaive? I explain what it is I want and why I want it.
He starts giggling. Then laughing. Then lots of people start laughing. It turns out, the music stopped and everyone heard my pleas through the door. It also turns out that none of them had poop knives, it was just my fucked up family with their fucked up bowels. FML.
And the best part is when his wife got to know about it!*

*I told this to my wife last night, who was amused and horrified at the same time. It turns out that she did not know what a poop knife was and had been using the old rusty knife hanging in the utility closet as a basic utility knife. Thankfully she didn't cook with it, but used it to open Amazon boxes.
She will be getting her own utility knife now.
[Edit: Common question - Why was this not in the bathroom instead of the laundry room? Answer. We only had one poop knife, and the laundry room was central to all three bathrooms. I have no idea why we didn't have three poop knives. All I know is that we didn't. We had the one. Possibly because my father was notoriously cheap about the weirdest things. So yes, we shared our poop knife.*"

In a city of global delicacies, of course we have to eat food with Michelin Stars. This was also more successful, with no bugs. Just before I left, I has a low fever and was coughing quite heavily, I ate lots of medivine, which lowered my fever. finally, my fever went down, and I was able to exit.""The medicine she has taken is ikely to have been an antipyretic, which lowers the bodies temperature when fever hits.*

*The ""infected"" woman explained in a post that unfortunately if her infection was diagnosed, she would become a “super-infected person”.*

*This news comes as many more cases of those infected with the virus have been revealed, including Wang Guangfa, a member of the expert group of the Chinese National Health and Medical Commission who had visited Wuhan earlier and stated that the epidemic was “controllable and preventable”, but he has been diagnosed with Wuhan pneumonia last night.*

*So far, 440 people have been infected. A total of 26 cases were reported in Guangdong and 14 cases were confirmed in Shenzhen.*

*China has placed infrared temperature measurements screening in airports, train stations, coach stations and terminals.The news comes after a French citizen had been reported to have suffered respiratory problems and other virus symptoms after returning to France from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city in which coronavirus appears to have originated.*

*The symptoms had previously been suspected to be coronavirus.*

*Yet, French director general of health, Jérôme Salomon, confirmed that the patient had received tests for viral infection at the Institut Pasteur health clinic, and all had come back negative.*

*Mr Salomon told French public service media FranceInfo: “He is doing well, and has returned home.”He added that in case of any doubt, the public was recommended to “stay at home”, and take “barrier measures” to avoid the spread of viruses, including washing hands, and avoiding excess contact with others*

*France has so far declined to put any systematic testing measures in place at its borders, and is not testing travellers arriving in the country from China.*

*In contrast, countries including Russia and Thailand have begun testing the temperature of all travellers arriving from China, in a bid to halt the infection.*

*Mr Solomon said: “This measure is not recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO)Yet, Ms Buzyn said that precautionary measures are being taken on direct flights from Wuhan, and posters with advice on how to avoid spreading the virus have been distributed in international airports across the country.*

*China has so far confirmed that more than 440 people have been infected with the virus since it appeared in Wuhan at the end of December.*

*Nine people have died in China so far.*

*This week, Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese scientist working at the country’s national health commission, said that the virus had been “confirmed” as spreading between humans; the first time this had been confirmed officially.*

*The virus has also been reported in the United States, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and Macau.*

*The World Health Organisation WHO is set to meet today, Wednesday January 22, in Geneva to “ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern”.*"
