Thirdly, regardless of what crime is actually being committed, they aren't legally allowed within our borders, so why wouldn't they be deported?  Fourthly, you're forgetting the word ""alleged"" before ""children"" there.  Human trafficking is a serious problem, and just taking the word of someone trying to sneak into the country with a child in tow isn't a great idea.

And finally, literally all countries do this.  There is not a country on the planet that doesn't do something to maintain their borders; that's one of the primary qualifiers for a sovereignty to be classified as a ""country"".  That means detaining people who violate those borders and then deporting them at the very least."

I'd also think it more helpful to identify specific actors who are suppressing the starving people, rather than just say ""business"".  From there it might be possible to figure out how to do something that has actual impact.

Proper governments are supposed to protect their people from predatory businesses, and if they aren't it's just further indication that the state isn't functioning properly for the people, but how to go about fixing that is also going to be a case-by-case issue that's even harder to resolve."
