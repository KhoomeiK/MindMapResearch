androiddev,ffdznh9,t1_ffc79tt,1579832924.0,"[I did it!!](https://imgur.com/8l2Ach2) Thanks. Your comment helped me research the different parts of the process. I decomplied the apk with apktool, used a program that converts Smali into readable Java, compared the [Java](https://imgur.com/t8mMYWv) to the [Smali](https://imgur.com/AAvrHyF), found the two values I had to change, recompiled with apktool, and signed with SignApk.

I realized that the way the timer slider worked was that each slider increment was given a value from 0 to 12 (""progress"" variable) and multiplied my 5, so in the smali, I changed

    mul-int/lit8 v2, p2, 0x5 

to

    mul-int/lit8 v2, p2, 0xa

which multiplied it my 10 instead of 5, so my slider now goes from 1 min to 120 min. I tested it and it works! It was quite fun learning about smali, apks, and to reverse-engineer an app hehe."

wholesomememes,feed0kt,t1_fedvhfg,1579031227.0,"I interpreted this meme as his image of himself, his self-confidence improving. In the first panel he considers himself ugly, in the second, average, and in the third, attractive.

Just browse incel forums or r/plasticsurgery and you'll find plenty of people who believe they are uglier than they really are. Doesn't matter if they're ""ugly as butt"", as you say, they might be a 2, but they see themselves as a -1. The way I interpreted this meme, those ""ugly as butt"" guys would go from considering themselves a -1 to a 4 or a 5, even though they would still be a 2, and that would be a good thing.

I didn't interpret it as ""under that unshaven face, shitty haircut, and lack of skincare, you're actually a supermodel"", although that will definitely make anyone less attractive as well."
