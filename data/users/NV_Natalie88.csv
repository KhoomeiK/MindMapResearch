sex,ff9a270,t1_ff99iud,1579708276.0,The book is the 5 love languages by Gary Chapman and it’s really good. Have you tried communicating about this or going to a couples counselor?
sex,ff86u5u,t3_es6tvh,1579667647.0,"Are you comfortable talking to your primary care physician? I go to mine for sexual health things. Also there is a good show on Netflix that talks about a bunch of different types of birth control. It’s called “Explained” and it’s the “Sex Explained” birth control episode. 
All gynecologists and doctors should practice professionalism and have heard just about every question in the book. Maybe try identifying what it is about asking that that makes it so uncomfortable for you. Hope this helps ✌🏻"

sex,fex2p3g,t3_eqtv72,1579423324.0,"I don’t have personal experience with this for myself just yet but I recently watched a show on Netflix, I think it was called “Explained” and there’s a sex version with an episode on different birth controls. It had good information in it including the copper IUD, vasectomies, and all sorts of stuff. Could be helpful."
cats,fewccir,t3_eqrovw,1579408304.0,I’m so sorry for your loss.
cats,few5pk2,t3_eqrafn,1579405771.0,My fur baby is named Eeveelyn!!!!! ❤️
sex,fetpjiu,t3_eqli2v,1579378036.0,Troll much?
Zumbosjustdesserts,feq1xhq,t1_fepvzc7,1579336311.0,Yeah I’m not sure why zumbo really gravitated toward her. Maybe he has a soft spot for struggling teens 🤣
Zumbosjustdesserts,fepq18u,t1_fepnxzt,1579327471.0,I agree. I must’ve forgotten about the golden ticket thing.
sex,fep1lut,t3_eq9jdr,1579310105.0,"Sounds like an accusation so yeah, women are not going to be happy when you make assumptions about what others may or may not be doing. I LOL’d though when you commented about their “lies” 🤣🤣"
aww,feoqor2,t1_feokv9i,1579304105.0,I’m so sorry to hear that. I was there last August with my 1 year old. Stay strong and take care of yourself.
aww,feokg3g,t3_eq7v8k,1579301452.0,Oh no 😓what happened?
psychotherapy,feojhdq,t1_feo9q4r,1579300935.0,"Yes, the classes and materials pump so much info into your head that it’s impossible to remember it all or even be able to logically organize everything. 
I’m going to be relying on listening skills and feeling out each client on their own as they come. The biggest thing my program has been teaching is to just listen, use natural empathetic skills and meet the client wherever they are and as safely as possible. Obviously if someone is panicking or suicidal then use appropriate measures of de escalation but otherwise, just be there for your clients and do your best. There’s a reason your program chose you like my program chose me. 😁"
psychotherapy,feo8g5s,t3_eq5j4u,1579296536.0,"I start my first practicum and client experience in February. I’m extremely anxious and nervous as well. I feel like my University program is good and I’m learning so so much but I feel the way they’ve prepared us to start seeing clients has not been the best up to this point. 
One things that’s helped me is that since you’re WILLING and WANTING to do this job, you really have all the skills you need and most of the clients will have not experienced someone to just listen to them and confide in. Don’t work harder than they are willing to and always, always give yourself time for self-care and decompression between each client. You will be great and I believe I will be too! We all got this 👊🏻💪🏻"
FoodPorn,feo53jk,t3_eq2pl7,1579295242.0,It’s beautiful and looks so yummy!
TheCircleTV,fenl8i4,t1_fenkw27,1579287081.0,"Yeah, it’s too enmeshed and certainly unhealthy. Lol"
TheCircleTV,fenkn6w,t1_fenkkqz,1579286719.0,I did the exact same thing 😂😂
TheCircleTV,fenjv83,t1_femtj1c,1579286255.0,Ahh alright. That makes sense. I assumed it was some sort of air conditioning going on but I only noticed it in her hair lol 😝
cats,femcik3,t3_epnure,1579248580.0,"I’m so sorry for your loss. I had a beautiful
Orange baby named Julius and I miss him everyday. Stay strong and take care of yourself in this rough time."
TheCircleTV,femc0ke,t3_epusub,1579247925.0,"She was extremely annoying and I agree with OP, made everyone in her generation look terrible. Didn’t try to be relatable, wasn’t helpful, and always had random wind blowing in her hair...? Just a waste of resources honestly."
Fishing,fembgad,t3_epl8d4,1579247206.0,Woweeee
TheCircleTV,felaeyr,t3_epqs4z,1579217582.0,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I literally just watched this right now.
Zumbosjustdesserts,felaabu,t3_epqgbl,1579217500.0,I agree. Maybe the producers wanted to make the show “more exciting” with the golden ticket thing but it seemed really useless. Simon was the best.
cats,fei51oi,t3_ep0uzv,1579130442.0,So sorry for your loss. Looks like she was a wonderful companion.
pics,fei3x71,t3_ep5t7i,1579129733.0,What’s wrong with rainbows? :-(   This sounds completely unreasonable.
