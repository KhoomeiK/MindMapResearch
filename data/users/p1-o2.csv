Whether you think so or not, people vastly prefer taking something delicious and fast acting rather than a gummy or RSO capsule. Infused drinks and snacks make people happy whether or not it's rational. The high is the same IMO."

news,fffemww,t1_fff8mg2,1579882290.0,"Yup, once the first few months of giddyness wears off in a legal state then people tend to treat it like any other consumable. If you can make it taste better than the competition then people will flock to it.

This is also why you see such a massive variety of beers and liquors. If everyone was okay with the same old thing then we'd have just basic vodka and whiskey, but consumers prefer novelty and quality. The cannabis industry is no different. 

The best cannabis infused chocolates go so quickly that the only way to buy them in my state is to be on a waiting list and you have about an hour to show up when it's your turn. Otherwise you're stuck with the medicated gummies."

It isn't necessarily about C# but the skills I've learned there make a lot of people come to me for advice at work about tooling and practical solutions. I definitely feel like it has given me a leg up on just understanding computation and how to get through it quickly/professionally.

furry_irl,ffa1mtj,t1_ff9oq0e,1579726072.0,"Yeah, I totally agree. Even in a breakup I approach it as friends with the goal of remaining good friends long afterward. That has worked out about 75% of the time! I honestly feel lucky every day to be surrounded by so many amazing people even if we are moving through different paths in life.

The internet is totally blessed for introducing me to so many new friends over the years."
feminineboys,ffa16xw,t3_esbd8f,1579725816.0,"If you are overweight then yes, losing weight will help a lot. The problem I see with friends is that they will lose the weight but not adjust their own self-image. Even once you do have a more feminine body it's really hard to actually convince yourself that you do if you've been treated masculine your whole life. Even the smallest of cuties have that problem.

This is what people mean when they say you're beautiful no matter what and to be easy on yourself. Nobody needs drastic physical changes to be feminine. At least half of the battle is confidence, and the other half is conforming to cultural standards like shaving and how you dress. Femininity is something you *are*, not something you have to earn.

It's so hard though. You're valid for feeling this way and you're up against a lot of social pressure. If you don't give up then you'll end up a strong and confident individual because of the huge mental obstacles you will overcome in the process.

Be kind to yourself."
ADHD_partners,ff9xql7,t3_esh2e0,1579723788.0,"This post is freaky in a small way because it sounds exactly like what people with ADHD go through and many of the ways they feel about it. I can only assume you two have a pretty strong connection with each other if it's affecting you that badly.

Something I have learned is that I have to recognize immediately when I'm being ignored and just disconnect from the situation. Even if it's an argument that I'm 100% in the right about. The moment I see the ADHD creating a wall between us then I stop, step back, and repeatedly communicate that we need to pause this until the other person hears me. Once they pause we can either decide to talk about it later in the day or the next morning, or we can find common ground and start over.

I think that you have to be willing to truly and sincerely accept that some things will never change, because this frees you up to work on finding solutions to work around those problems.

Ultimately, I have to see the person with ADHD as a culmination of their best moments and realize that their bad moments are as difficult for them to control as for me to deal with. That doesn't mean I will participate in their behavior. I just immediately remove myself from it to avoid rewarding it and trust that my partner will want to work things out once they clear their head.

I hope things work out for you and I'm sorry if this sounded like one long ramble. There's also a good chance you've already heard all this before, in which case you should reconsider that exoensive CBT therapy. It's agonizingly slow but it does help a lot for most people if they stick with it long term.

They really, really have to stick with it though. CBT isn't something you can stop practicing after a year or two but many people do."
PoliticalHumor,ff9seiu,t1_ff9cvhg,1579720201.0,"The reason it's still a debate is campaign finance laws. Their opinions are bought by their donors. They don't work for the American people anymore. They work for the highest bidder, both internationally and domestic.
