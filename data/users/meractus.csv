HongKong,ffepne5,t1_ffengh3,1579859166.0,Tip: Bring masks for your friends.
AskReddit,ffcstpr,t3_ess76y,1579806545.0,"Don't do this. It hurts. 

Put your pinkie together, nail facing up, and bite on the nail gently (exerting as much pressure without causing pain). 

Count to 60 while maintaining this pressure. 

Now, take your pinkies out of your mouth, and hook them together [like spelling the letter S](https://images.app.goo.gl/Lio9q1tzgYMwSfHC9) and pull your hands apart, while the fingers are hooked together. 

You should feel a little shooting pain in the fingers."
AskReddit,ffcq3n4,t3_esse9d,1579804849.0,"Back when I was serving National Service in Singapore (my country of birth, although I hadn't spent extended periods living there.. this will come in relevant later), I was just starting to date this girl who had just started working in 'legal.

She was a but touchy about things, and I was young and pretending to be ""worldly"", and trying to get into her pants. 

We had met up at a bus terminal, and was about to head out to grab lunch (or a movie). Not being accustomed to how bus stations were layed out in Singapore, I always had a hard time finding my bus, navigating etc. 

While walking through this large, confusing bus terminal, I saw a blind man (sun glasses and a striped walking stick), and I was wondering how he knew where to go. He didn't seem to be walking purposefully, and seemed slightly distressed. 

Remembering someone telling me that blind people should be led by giving them your elbow, I asked the blind old man where he was going, and he told me his bus number. My date found the bus line and we headed in that direction, me being very proud of knowing to give him my elbow, and of being a good Samaritan (when nobody else in this relatively crowded station was helping him!). 

After walking a few minutes, the blind old man stops, let's go of my hand, unzips his pants, **WHIPS OUT HIS DICK, AND STARTS PISSING**. I stop in shock and step back from the growing puddle of piss, not knowing WTF, but also not wanting to draw attention to the situation. Guilt by association I guess. 

This is Singapore. Littering comes with a SGD500 (~USD 250) penalty  and/or community service of street sweeping. Some American kid got CANED on his ass for vandalizing cars. Walking around naked in your house is illegal if people can see you. I did NOT KNOW WTF THE PENALTY WAS FOR WHIPPING YOUR DICK OUT IN A PUBLIC BUS TERMINAL AND PISSING ON THE FLOOR IS. I was in the military! Rule1 :Avoid trouble! I was freaking out a little in my head. 

I look at my date, who seemed nonchalant about the situation. 

I reassess the situation. Nobody else was freaking out. Am I over reacting? 

The old man (finally) stops pissing, gives his old man dick two messy shakes, and cramming his shrivelled sausage back in a tangle of salt n pepper curly knotted hairs. He doesn't zip. 


I didn't notice if his fingers were wet, but he stuck his hand out again, as if looking for my elbow. 

Half in shock, half wanting to just get away from that puddle of piss, I lean over, offer him my elbow, and lead him forward. 

He walks through his piss, tracking a trail of pissy foot prints to his bus, we put him on the bus, and we continue on our date. 

We never talked about this situation. 

Till this day, I don't know WTF happened. Was that normal? Did I meet a blind guy who liked to piss in public? Just.... Wtf. It's been almost two decades, and I can't get the image of this blind man shaking his old dick out in public, as if at a urinal."

HongKong,fevug6p,t3_eqeclc,1579401650.0,"I think it's too early to panic. On the other hand, it's flu season. 

**Panic: **

1) There are new cases in Wuhan after the seafood market has shut down. 

2) There are cases outside of China

3) China has a history of not being honest during previous epidemics

4) It's flu season in HK, so any standard anti-flu precautions is a good idea 

5) HK hospitals are always packed during flu season. 

https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3045387/hong-kong-enters-winter-peak-flu-season-23

**Don't panic:**

1) No verified cases in HK

2) Even if it spreads between people, it doesn't seem very contagious. Wuhan is a city of 11million people. It would have spread faster if it's a bad one. 

2.5) Survival rate seems ok (but not enough cases to tell, really)
