On a positive note,  I have zero weed cravings. None at all.  I feel less nervous - I was suffering pretty bad with anxiety. Not saying its gone, but its less. I also cut coffee out, so this could be down to that too.  My sleep last night was normal, compared to the other days. I have noticed that I want to get out of bed in the morning. When I was smoking I just wanted to sleep, and some days wouldn't get up till past noon. Overall I am happy I stopped smoking. I felt good up to day 3, and then started to feel this agitation.
