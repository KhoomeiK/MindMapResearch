Say right now (hypothetically) it's a 50/50 shot of Bernie or Biden winning the primary. Say, if one of them runs smear campaigns, then their respective chance of winning goes up to 60%. However, if they lose (40% chance), then their opponent's chances are decimated in the General. Was the smear campaign worth it? In this example, I'd say no.

politics,ff9cukt,t1_ff9bewh,1579710151.0,"It's a good question, and it's tough. Progressives are gaining more and more spotlight than they have before, but the BIG downside of this is that it can dilute the democratic vote (e.g. votes going to the god-awful pseudoscience Green party in the general). Here's what we can do:

* Primaries are the time to shine. Most polls don't have Sanders as the favorite, but he can still win, he still has a real chance. Get out there and advocate for your candidate.
* Talk to your current representatives, and advocate for the policies you want. They don't always listen, but sometimes they do, especially if enough people call/write in.
* Keep advocating for progressive change, regardless of whether or not your candidate wins the primary. $15 minimum wage, as an example, wasn't discussed on anywhere near the national stage prior to 2015 or so. Now, it has a real chance of happening in the next several years (and already has happened in some select areas). Sanders didn't give up after he lost the 2016 primary - he kept fighting the good fight.
* Worst comes to worst, most progressives are on the younger side, and more conservatives and centrists are on the older side. Wait it out, and those older folks will die. Maybe a little morbid, but true.

Honestly, my biggest concern at the moment is that future elections will be ACTUALLY rigged, so that our votes *really* don't matter. If that happens, I don't see a future for change in this country."

But let's not kid ourselves. *Sanders is still an underdog.* Take a look at the [Megathread from 2 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/enbanj/discussion_thread_democratic_presidential_primary/). Sanders is behind Biden in every national poll except one. In about half of them, he's about 10 points behind. More evidence: take a look at [current betting odds](https://www.oddsshark.com/other/2020-usa-presidential-odds-futures).

The ""projection"" logic you presented is a little faulty; Sanders went from ""just"" a state senator to a nationally recognized figure in 2016. There's certainly still plenty of room for him to grow in recognition and support, but it'll likely take substantially more effort for him to make the kind of shift he did in 2016.

Please don't get me wrong: I would love for him to win and he DOES have a REAL shot at it. But, at the moment, he's undeniably an underdog."
politics,fedig1k,t1_fedbg4g,1579012350.0,"It's overblown. Articles about Sanders killing it at the polls make the front page almost daily on Reddit, but if you look nationally, he's still substantially behind Biden in most polls.

financialindependence,fd2xedt,t3_ejtx95,1578152636.0,"Starting next year, my wife+my income will be over $200k. I've been maxing my roth IRA, but I was doing some research, and it sounds like moving forward, I should do a backdoor roth to continue my contributions. However, I had money from an old employer's 401k that closed and I needed to roll over to a traditional IRA. As such, I currently have about $12k in my traditional IRA, $1.6k of which is gains.

I was reading the [Boglesheads wiki on backdoor roth](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth), and it sounds like I can either: 1. Convert it all to a roth, and pay tax on the $12k. 2. Roll it over to my current employer's 401k. Decent option, but the downside is my employer uses a management company that basically costs me the cost of Vanguard plus an additional 0.25% annually or so. Not too bad, but not perfect. 3. Start a business and roll it into an individual 401k. Could I just sell something on eBay and call it a business? How hard would this actually be to set up?
