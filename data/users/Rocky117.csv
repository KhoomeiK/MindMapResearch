I normally support police but this is really stupid. I can’t endorse this crap. I don’t even think the guy had a weapon. People could use the logic that he was driving dangerously and thus needed to be treated as if he was dangerous (I have seen comments saying this exact thing BTW.) but that doesn’t fucking apply when he is OUT OF THE CAR WITH NO WEAPON.

unpopularopinion,ff2ng7k,t3_er1syq,1579514791.0,"Same exact thing happens when there is an injured cat or dog. If you go into ANY video that is about rescuing an animal, everyone in the comments says the same version of “if I find who did this I am going to kill them.” Or “These people are going to hell.” Even though THERE IS NO SIGN OF ABUSE AT ALL.

Video of a Feral cat scared of a human. It is backing up, hissing and feigning attacks. People will say “that feral cat is terrified it obviously had been abused by humans.” Completely ignoring the fact that all unsocialized or feral cats are going to hiss and run away. ESPECIALLY the one in the video I’m talking about because it was starving.

I mean seriously go check for yourself. Pull up ANY animal rescue video of a cat or dog and you will see dozens of comments saying the same thing by threatening to hurt whoever did it and bla bla bla. Obviously if someone did abuse the animal they’re a piece of shit, But you don’t just ASSUME that it is the case. All it does is stir everyone in the comments into a frenzy of anger directed towards NOBODY because there are no signs of abuse at all.
