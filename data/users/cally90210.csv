dogs,ffe0rna,t3_et0dtk,1579833730.0,"Hi! I'm three months into rehoming an 11yo husky. The main thing is just being in each others' presence, I think. Suka was very quiet and passive to begin with, and then almost immediately had a health crisis (pyometra) and an emergency hysterectomy. So that was stressful, but also oddly bonding – I was sleeping in the kitchen with her, and hand feeding her every few hours when she was barely eating, and I really think that made a difference to our relationship. I know a sled dog owner who hand feeds every new recruit to his kennels for a few weeks, so I think that helps cement you as 'top dog' and provider in their eyes.   


We walked little and often to begin with. Suka had already done some off-lead training but I didn't take her off for 3-4 weeks, and then only for tiny bits until I was confident in her recall. Simply: you don't know what will happen when you first release them, so do it somewhere contained and with few distractions, then work up. Don't do too many treats early on, just be friendly and pat them when they want, and try to be a fun person to be around - play games or run with him/her

Suka wasn't a 'rescue' so much as a retiree. (She'd been a working dog, and is now living a much lazier life with me). So rescues will likely be more complicated, but I think the same logic applies – be present as much as possible. Be warm and fun to be around. Feed them at regular times and possibly hand feed if they are gentle enough. Get them in a routine as fast as possible so they can relax and know what's expected of them"
dogs,ffe04lw,t3_et1f5b,1579833268.0,"Hmmmm. Difficult, and also quite hard to judge from this description. I'd hire a trainer for a few sessions to discuss this with in more depth, they might have more specific insight?"
dogs,ffdz9s8,t3_et2z91,1579832646.0,So sweet. I've been teaching my 11yo rehomed husky (very docile and usually near-silent) to 'go to your bed' and tonight she was so overcome when she 'got it' that she began to howl in excitement every time I asked her to do it. It was adorable.
dogs,fend61w,t1_fen9uyy,1579282152.0,"Ok. Sorry, I didn't mean to be aggressive, but a few points (which I'm sure you've already thought of already, but are important so worth reiterating):  
\- yes, this particular dog will not happen again. But you obviously didn't expect this opportunity to come up, were not considering a third dog before, and are now. So although this opportunity won't come up again, that's not to say ones \*like it\* won't, and you will feel different then. So the question is: is this decision right for you right now?  
\- the third dog is a bit of an unknown quantity. Could adapt amazingly well, be very obedient already and healthy, and add almost no extra work. Or it could add way more work. You know the dog, so will have a better sense than I possibly could, but obviously there's a risk that you are taking on much more responsibility than you have at the moment.

\- age/training of the third dog is obviously the most important factor that will impact the above. We can't advise on that, but you'll know.

\- a new baby, alone, is often enough to stretch a mother's mental health (and often its parents' relationship) to the very maximum. Really do take that seriously. 

\- a dog can make the above exponentially worse, if it's not the right dog. I know a couple who, heartbroken, had to rehome their second dog (of two) because they had a baby and the dog was simply too energetic and too much to handle on top of all the new baby stress. It was a sweet, nice-natured spaniel but it needed too much exercise and was driving them all insane. They kept the first (older) spaniel. The second spaniel went to a close friend who is a farmer so gets loads of exercise and they still get to see it. It was a great solution, but obviously it was heart-wrenching to give the dog up when they loved it so much. And that was only a second dog, that they had owned for some time.  


So the risk of emotional overwhelm is serious, I would suggest holding off. Two dogs and a new baby is a lot to handle already. But only you know how easy and well trained and chill the third dog is, and how much help you can afford if things get too much."
dogs,fen5dd7,t1_fempfyc,1579277335.0,"This feels like a false assumption. Why would you 'never do it' if you don't do it now? Yes, this dog is a good opportunity, but other opportunities will come up, and probably at a better time.

If you want the dog, get the dog, but don't convince yourself this is the only dog that will ever come up"

dogs,fdk3nrm,t3_elqugn,1578495271.0,"Hi, Scottish person here who recently brought a dog in from overseas. Yes it's possible to import three dogs, but the cost and effort depends a LOT on how you do it. 

Flying dogs into the UK is very complicated, I imported a dog from the EU recently and couldn't find an airline to let me fly with the dog in the hold, they wanted the dog to be flown cargo which cost a lot. Best would be overland in a car, if you can do that, as you can catch any car ferry from the continent into the UK and keep the dogs inside the car. Then you also don't need to worry about the expensive crates.

I recommend getting the ferry from Amsterdam to Newcastle with DFDS which has dog friendly cabins. You can only get 2 dogs in the cabin though, so you'd need two cabins. You can travel this way with or without a car, but you should book this kind of cabin  over the phone.

Here's all the info on the necessary vaccinations and so on. [https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad](https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad) It is more involved if the dogs don't have a european passport, so be prepared for quite a bit of work and expense.

You can also hire companies to do it all for you, which removes the stress, but prepare for it to cost £££££"
