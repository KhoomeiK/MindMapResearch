Poverty can mean all kinds of things, from having 4 roommates in a place designed for 2 people, to living on the street in a box.  Some people living on the street actually have jobs that they somehow manage to make it to every day.  Those jobs don't pay enough for them to move beyond hand to mouth, so they stay stuck in a vicious cycle of sleeping in their car, or hiding out in a tent under an overpass for the night.

Anyone who thinks Wal-Mart is as big as it is because it's convenient should actually go into one of their stores.  Sure they got everything, but you can't find it.  It's not convenient to wander around the store to get 8 items.

But complaining when you just can't fix a car like you did in 1987 with some booger welds and bondo, just doesn't cut it.  Most vehicles in 2020 have 3-8 different types of metal used to create the chassis, frame, and body.  Some use Boron Steel to make up major structural components. Boron Steel is one of the hardest steels available, nearly impossible to dent, and basically impossible to drill.  Volvo uses it extensively, and they are pretty much universally known as one of the safest cars on the road.

A Ford F150 Body is Riveted and Glued together.  Believe it or not, Rivet Bonding is actually stronger than welding in many cases.  But old farts just wanna pull out the old MillerMatic with some .23 wire and start burning metal.  It just doesn't work that way these days."

California only had just over 1000 convictions for various types of insurance fraud in 2018.   They have over a million insurance claims a year in California alone for all types of insurance from homeowners, to worker's comp, to automotive.   Nearly 1/3 claims paid out is actually a fraudulent claim, but we can't deny those claims without absolute proof, because the DA has to prove a criminal case in order to win.   They are reluctant to prosecute when it's only likely that the case is fraudulent.  It's pretty obvious that a claim is fraudulent when you deny it and the claimant just drops the whole thing. If it were a real claim, they would produce the evidence we ask of them or file a DOI complaint that we are required to respond to.

IdiotsInCars,fdsxwa2,t1_fdsmrv1,1578709375.0,"That is not covered.   We get one every once in a while where the spouse was upset and intentionally crashed the car into the other spouse's vehicle.  Both vehicles totaled, but because the wreck was an intentional act, $0 of coverage for the loss.   

 I just wrote one where the guys boyfriend crashed his VW into the side of boyfriends Mercedes while pulling out of the driveway.  Both are on the policy, so both cars are covered.   It wasn't on purpose, so we paid."
IdiotsInCars,fdsxf6t,t1_fdsihb3,1578709191.0,"Yeah as one of my seniors managers put it, ""we cover stupid, we don't cover on purpose""  - So we'll cover you accidentally putting Gas in your diesel, but won't cover when your wife gets mad and reverses into your car on purporse or smashes it with a hammer."
IdiotsInCars,fdsx31a,t1_fdsjsgj,1578709063.0,"If you really want to get mad - 300 out of every 1000 in premiums is estimated to go towards paying actual fraudulent claims  and fighting fraud claims.  Not idiots like this, actual fraud schemes.

&#x200B;

 Insurance companies have a mandate to fight fraud, and we can actually be fined if we don't pursue it aggressively enough.   Think about it, your premiums would be 30 percent lower if we didn't have to spend all that money paying out fraudulent claims and fighting fraud."
IdiotsInCars,fdswok3,t1_fds7dkf,1578708918.0,"Yeah this is pretty much how all companies operate.  We are not looking to deny your claim unless we have absolute proof or think it's worth it to try to prove in court.  Otherwise we risk the bad faith lawsuit and fines that go along with it.  We are getting fined in states like California just because the name of the insurance company on the appraisal doesn't match the actual underwriting entity name that is listed on the customer policy.  It's getting crazy out there.  My company paid hundreds of thousands in DOI fines all over the country last year.  Every company pretty much does, because there are literally thousands of things we can get fined for."
todayilearned,fdsmf0o,t1_fdqddio,1578705105.0,"Yeah but the whole thing is a mess.  I've been all over the new and improved sections of the Tollway, 635 Express, 35 Express.  Its still a disaster because it just doesnt connect thr right way.  There is no way to go from 75 south to the express lane west without merging with 635 main traffic.  The same is true for going from the 635 Express to 75 North.  These are the 2 busiest connections to the express, and you have to sit in 10 minutes of traffic to change directions.  It's the single biggest fuckup I can think of.  The kicker is the whole thing is run by some obscure entity composed of a bunch of investment bankers.  The whole thing reeks of crony capitalism.  We have to end the idea that everything works better when its for profit.  The only people making money off the road should be the people building and maintaining them.  Over a billion dollars was spent on this project, and I would consider it an utter failure after living here 35 years."
atheism,fdqd1a8,t1_fdpn617,1578663399.0,I have a feeling the Church will prevail in court.  You can not be sued for consequences another person suffers at the hands of the law if you report them.  Whistleblowers Laws pretty much cover this.

Motocross,fdpfo1d,t3_emk5kr,1578627403.0,"I have about 20 hours on my Dad's KTM 450 and Beta with a Rekluse.  His KTM was a 2008 with the original Rekluse system.  It had 0 clutch action, which sucked when you wanted to do a clutch drop and get some extra power to jump a log or whatever.  

The Beta is a 2017 300RR which I think is the 3.0 Rekluse.  The clutch lever actually does something on this bike, but it still has all the downsides other posters have described.   No engine braking, no bump/pull starting.     I personally don't think it's worth it.  My dad loves it because he 65 and can't ride that hard, but I prefer the feel of the a standard clutch for 90 percent of trail riding."
todayilearned,fdpeoc2,t1_fdoqdq5,1578626691.0,"ANNND you can Prepay for a spot, and it will cost you 100 bucks for a regular event.  When you pull up to park, you can just pay 35 Cash to park in the same FUCKING LOT!   I was so damn mad, because the website made it seem like parking was already completely sold out a few hours before the event.  Only to pull up, see i could have paid 35, and end up parking right next to someone who pulled in before me and paid 35 cash to park!   FUCK JERRY JONES!   It cots me 200 damn dollars to take my kid to the Supercross now.  I'm skipping it this year and going to more local tracks and watching amateurs."

Dirtbikes,fdpe88i,t1_fdogjp3,1578626374.0,"Same here.  I run Rogue's on my Trail bike, and ran Pillow Top's on the MX bike.    I don't currently have an MX bike, so I took my trail bike to the MX track a few weeks ago.  I really wish I had the pillow tops for the track.  I don't know why, but the Rogues feel wrong on the MX track."

AskReddit,fdmab54,t1_fdlv52u,1578543784.0,"Look on Craigslist.  I found  a local girl who is just starting up her own operation.  She is only charging us 45 bucks an hour and does a great job.  We are providing the cleaning materials because we have it all anyway so we can clean up after ourselves, so it works out for everyone."
AskReddit,fdma1do,t1_fdm2h9w,1578543577.0,"I guess it just depends in your area.  Everything around me is 70+ for synthetic blend oil changes with house brand filters.  Even the dealers are charging that much.  I just decided I would take the opportunity to become really familiar with my vehicle and perform a thorough inspection every time I change the oil.  Sure I spend about and hour looking over the car with the oil change included, but I'm more likely to spot a potential issue than the low wage lube tech who barely has time to change the filter and not strip out the drain plug.

Edited to add,

When you add in the travel and wait time for paying someone to do it, you suddenly realize you might as well change your own."
AskReddit,fdm9cck,t3_elvt0p,1578543053.0,"I have been unmedicated for almost 20 years. I'm 35 now. In that time, I have learned to be aware of my ADD, and to check myself in ways to ensure that it does not cause me issues. Things like having designated places for my personal items that I use often are a big help.  Some things are a still a mess, like my toolbox and garage, but I guess that's pretty normal.  

It takes work every day to recognize your own behavioral tendencies and overcome them."
