Yeah, that's bullshit, I agree. How we can all live in the same world with the same restrictive gender roles and still think that the only possible way anyone could ever be any form of trans is to harm women, is beyond me. The question is why aren't *more* people trans. No, not really: but what I'm saying is that being held to gendered expectations is hard for most people. And to people who assume malicious intent in every trans person: believe it or not, most people have better things to do than harm women. Just because predators abuse self-ID, doesn't mean every trans person is a predator or even a fetishist. And I could even make the argument that even ""fetishists"" aren't inherently evil, and they might even be legitimately trans. Idk. I wish Blanchard wasn't a pariah in the scientific community, because then maybe his research could be expanded upon. Maybe he could be proven wrong, even. I don't think we've studied human sexual response thoroughly enough yet to conclusively prove or disprove Blanchard's typology theory.

>6) People assuming I'm ignorant or misguided about my own existence. I am capable of reporting my experiences to you as I experience them. I have talked to mental health professionals about these things. I promise y'all that y'all aren't the first people to suggest I might not actually be trans.

I would be guilty of thinking you're misguided, since you ID as NB. But I'm not gonna be a dick about it! I would just ask you: do you accept that many ""cis"" people may also count as ""NB"", by some definition? That maybe most people don't have an inner sense of gender, either? I just let people treat me ""like a woman"", because I am one, physically, and it's just easier. But I don't *feel like a woman*. Am I NB? I don't think so: I think I'm just a humanoid trying to live in this crazy, gendered world.

And I also agree about the downvoting. Seriously, people: how would you feel if you had minority views here and people either downvoted you, or replied to you with condescending comments as if you're a little slow? It feels like shit. It's rude and it's not helpful. It makes people not want to comment here."

I suspect that even within GC/radical feminism, people also have their differences. That's fine, too. I don't think everyone who holds a certain belief has to agree to make a philosophy/worldview coherent.

But I refuse to look at every man I see as a penis possessed nutcase (no pun intended).

I've been ""possessed"" to do some pretty crazy things myself, but all I have are female genitals. I empathize with men just as much as I do women. We all have biological drives.

Agreed.

>Some edge cases do indeed exist, they are humans to and can rightfully be accommodated in various ways.  The edge cases do not disprove the rule or make it unnecessary for those two large groups to have a name,  to have advocacy and sort out their in group and inter group problems. 

Also agreed. But the problem I have with class based analysis, even when it's about actual economic class, is that it polarizes. I think we can look at differences without being polarized. That's why I dislike both TheRedPill and ThePinkPill: when we look at men and women as essentially different (not just two reproductive systems and their corresponding strategies) we become no better than any other biological or social determinist. People go against their programming all the time. If we can't, we may as well all kill ourselves! But we do. I do. Therefore, it's possible, and that's what we should strive for.

So I can't get behind that. As for whether you are ""normal""? Hell if I know. Probably somewhat normal. Fantasy is different than reality, though. Most men and women wouldn't dream of acting on their every perverted thought! But we all have them.

I don't think self-ID is good enough, but I think anything where you're looking between people's legs to decide where they can pee is murky territory. It would be ideal to have a benevolent kind of gatekeeping in the medical establishment, to weed out the trenders and predators, and then assume anyone else who meets the criteria gets to use whatever bathroom they want.

I don't see it. I don't become fearful because I see a penis (which I don't, usually, as we wear clothing), I become fearful if I see a creepy man who looks like he's up to no good. What do the penis and testicles themselves have to do with it? Supposedly even castrated sex offenders continue to offend, which does *imply* that it's something mental. Does this ""something mental"" usually occur in males? Yes. But it's not the fault of the penis. Lots of people have penises that they manage to keep in their pants just fine.

If it weren't for the fact that geologists actually CAN draw those lines in the sand, I think it works just fine.

Sex, unfortunately, just hasn't been studied enough to confidently draw the same line. That's not necessarily because it's inherently more fuzzy or mysterious than anything else: more like because we've barely been self aware as a species for a blip of time, and we've been prudish, misogynist Puritans clutching our pearls for most of that time!

Sex may be as old as the hills, but sexology isn't. Just to tie in the hill analogy again. We need more hormone studies, especially those including the kind of thing Benjamin Boyce is doing: getting people's personal, subjective accounts of how hormones change thoughts, feelings and behavior."

Some people call them ""sex roles"" other people call them ""gender"". IDGAF what they're called, they're behaviors that are expected based on either what's between their legs or how their clothed body appears to others.

They're only just beginning to learn about the brain science. There is something about a male brain that makes it more likely to be psychopathic. It'll all make sense when autism gets figured out. That doesn't mean that men are somehow more inherently psychopathic, either. My whole thing is that men are usually pretty pro-social and decent guys including, and many of those are trans women. It's just that we're only scratching the surface of how the brain processes social cues. We don't understand the gender and sex implications yet. 

Science reveals inconvenient truths. This is not cut-and-dried. Each sex had their strategy in evolution, and to some extent we've carried that out into the future. I'm not a biological determinist OR a social constructionist. I won't go into much detail here because I have a feeling that you think I'm out of my mind anyway: we're not going to agree, that that's fine. But I have my reasons for thinking that the whole gender and sex situation is a lot more complicated than either gender critical or queer theory can explain.

Another thing I keep mentioning, because I listen to the Benjamin Boyce interviews with endocrinologists and sexologists and all kinds of people, is that we don't really know what's going on with hormones.The thing that seems to be pretty certain is that hormones are serious business and we shouldn't be just giving them out to anyone who wants them.

But how do hormones factor into brain development? The fetus undergoes a hormone bath which seems to determine some of its adult sexual behavior. If everyone could stop being such Puritans, we could study this stuff more thoroughly. 

I like trying to steel man queer theory, as well as gender critical, sometimes. What I'm learning is that there may be an argument to be made for gender. I'm not sure yet. This is something I want to see more research on before I make my call."

GCdebatesQT,feaxvq3,t1_feajl5m,1578953345.0,"
Yeah, if sex were a mountain, gender would be everything from a hill to a flat plain. There would be points on the way between plain and mountain: something like ""pink is a girl color"" would be an anthill, whereas a more reasonable stereotype like ""women aren't violent"" would be one of the borderline cases: a mountain so small it could be called a hill. Whereas something that's *definitely* based on sex, like ""having a uterus"" would be a mountain.

I'm liking the mountain example more as I'm thinking about it, because I'm visualizing the decline from a mountain down to a hill, then to a plain; essentially, from something to nothing. From something meaningful, that we should care about, to something completely made up and useless. As the realities of actual sex devolve into stereotypes about gender, they become less and less substantial, until they turn into arbitrary, superficial things like clothing colors. But there's no line we can point to as the point at which the concept in question stopped being sex and turned into gender. It's often a matter of opinion. Maybe this sex-gender continuum could be called a bimodal distribution. I've heard that biological sex is bimodal, and that makes sense to me: two main categories, but with very fuzzy borders between them. So there's sex, which is real and tangible, then gender, which is invented, but the less obvious things make up the fuzzy part in between."
GCdebatesQT,fea5rv7,t3_eo8t1m,1578944686.0,"I don't believe that there's a sharp divide between gender  and sex. Especially when we factor in hormones, which affect feelings and behavior.

Sex is innate, and gender is socially constructed. But it's not like we can draw a line in the sand to demarcate the borders between sex and gender. Most human behavior is a pretty complex mix of nature and nurture.

So I usually try to be specific, but I probably do slip up from time to time. I have no idea if TRAs now think sex and gender the same thing, but maybe they do; it wouldn't surprise me, as many already think sex itself is socially constructed. And gender actually *is* socially constructed, so they could lump the two together and still be ""logically consistent"" (by their own version of logic, that is)."

That really depends. Some natal women insist that they are treated just as men are. I see what they're getting at, but I'd still guess they're wrong. That's why it's very complicated, imo. This is the territory of purely subjective experience, where people are even less ""reliable narrators"" than usual.

I brought up catcalling in addition to a number of other examples that usually only women (or people perceived to be women) experience.

Thanks for being polite. I've noticed your posts here, and you are very reasonable. I totally get the GC POV, I swear! It's just that I try to be very specific about the issues I see with being a GC absolutist.

There seem to be many misunderstandings all around. I think most of the QT/TRA stuff is nonsense, and yet, trans people existed before QT. It's pretty rare, though. The fact that it's on the public's radar now is causing a lot of problems. I don't blame the transmed types for looking back on the days when they could just transition and then be stealth. But this large scale coming out process also coincides with what seems to be a collective gender/sex crisis, brought on partly by social media (especially dating apps), and partly because it's just time to sort these things out (the timeline: sexual revolution happened, then some backlash, then gay acceptance, safe sex, then internet porn, ugh). We still have details to iron out when it comes to how to live in an egalitarian society. Can we cut women and men a little slack? That remains to be seen. But that gender roles do seem to hurt people and make them behave in strange ways. I'm trying to cut everyone a little slack as long as they are somewhat reasonable."

I'm not into exploring ideas without proposing solutions. I've proposed some on this sub.

Or we let the ones who pass [*] in the women's room. That would be fine with me.

[*] My definition of passing means: I'm buying it, that you're trying to be respectful of natal women, that you're trying to assimilate into the culture of a woman's bathroom, that you have no interest in harming anyone, just peeing, nothing to see here folks.

Oh, I forget to mention another thing we share: estrogen.

Trans people are gonna exist, and we're gonna have to get along eventually. That's why we should be careful gatekeepers in the early years of this experiment of trans people being openly trans. We can't let them run around and boss people around, but we can try to get along with them, perhaps making very reasonable demands and sticking to those. It's not good to be a sycophantic ally anyway. That would be infantilizing, to just go along blindly with everything some mob of online trans people say is the right way to do things. Who are they to decide? Ideally, we'd align when our interests are mutual, which they sometimes are. But we wouldn't just give in to every crazy demand. There is a way to set respectful, mutual boundaries. There are ways to have functioning relationships where both parties get their needs met.

I’m not trying to say any of this to prove TWAW. I just think it’s important to note that sexists don’t always use female biology to inform their sexism. You could argue that because misogyny has historically been about sex (not “gender”) that a passing trans woman is just confusing a man who hates women.

Some trans women do pass. Do most? I have no idea. That would be very hard to prove for many reasons.

The reason I had to preface everything else I said with that is because otherwise, none of my examples would make sense, because a non passing trans woman most likely wouldn’t treated as a woman. But for those who do pass: to the extent that other people do treat them like women, they share social experiences with us. As in, people are sexist towards them (despite not knowing their actual birth sex), unfortunately.

In the best case scenario for them (passing), strangers would treat them like they would any other woman, as for all the stranger knows, they are a natal woman."
GCdebatesQT,fe442x9,t1_fe37o8r,1578855625.0,"Here's one thing both have in common: being perceived by society as women (assuming the trans woman passes).

I'm guessing trans woman who pass get catcalled, men open doors for them, and are expected to always be pleasant and submissive and friendly. They probably even get accused of being ""on their period"" if they don't conform to these double standards. People probably expect them to fawn over babies, and smile politely at every bad joke. They'll be expected to wear makeup if they have a job dealing with the public in any capacity. If they don't, people will be all ""Are you sick? Are you tired?"" To which they'll have to reply: ""No, this is just my face"".

What I'm saying is that if they pass, people will treat them the way they treat any other woman. Maybe if they're tall, people will be more intimidated by them, or less likely to pick a fight with them. But if they pass (which many do) even people who don't accept transgender identities at all would still, unwittingly, treat them as women (for better or worse).

While we share some experiences, to me the big difference (besides the aftereffects of male socialization) is that we didn't get a choice, but they did. Having had a say in the matter is a privilege that natal women aren't given. That's why I would hope more trans women would help us set the boundaries of what being a woman means, and more importantly, what it *doesn't* mean. But they're all individuals, and many are operating under an ideological framework of liberal/pop feminism that's so ""sex positive"" that it implicitly condones the degradation of women (be they trans or natal). So I would argue that many of our interests are aligned, despite there being areas where our interests conflict (trans women participating in sports, having access to female only spaces, etc)."
GCdebatesQT,fdwjf3d,t1_fdwez6p,1578759314.0,"I think that’s exactly what the reasonable QTs are getting at. Because for someone to think that passing means that the person is like their chosen gender *in all ways* would just be silly, imo. Someone could be like their chosen gender even in most ways, or in many meaningful ways, but if they were like their chosen gender in ALL ways, they wouldn’t even be trans! I think that’s fine. Real trans people exist (but not so many as to be proportionate to their media presence, I’m guessing). But it’s important that there are distinctions made between trans women and natal women. That doesn’t mean that they can’t function as we do in society in most ways, but no one should be pretending that they’re exactly the same as us. They’re just not: and that’s fine. I don’t want to live in world where everyone is the same. But we can’t be completely “gender/sex blind”, just as we can’t be color blind all the time.

GCdebatesQT,fdw1q5b,t3_en7b53,1578754158.0,"Passing is binary (yes/no) for each individual's reaction to the trans person in question. But it's only binary in time and space, mind you. On a different day, from a different angle: different story.

And each individual has a slightly different standard of passing. Some people will think a certain trans person doesn't pass, but another person might.

Passing is not an exact science. It helps smooth over social interactions, but if I were a discriminating gender therapist, I would include passing, as well as desire to pass, ability to pass, and other things, into my criteria for whether transition is likely to go over well. The current medical establishment is affirmation only, which means they don't make these crucial judgement calls.

We have to decide on a reasonable standard and stick with it. That standard wouldn't be binary (pass/fail... ha) but it would include how well someone passes, because if they really want to be treated as their preferred gender, they should try to pass to the best of their ability. So in my perfect world, this would be taken into account, and then maybe a team of professionals would decide whether to allow sex markers to be changed on IDs and such. With adequate gatekeeping, someone like Yaniv wouldn't have had a case to begin with. Not because JY doesn't pass, either: that's just one of a few reasons that person would've set off alarm bells, had there been any reasonable gatekeepers in place.

There are gatekeepers in life, folks; I'm sorry. I'm working on getting the gatekeepers to give me an autism spectrum diagnosis, because I think it would be useful for me to know. That's just a personal example of gatekeeping in action that I'm using to describe how innocuous gatekeeping can be. I won't let the medical establishment damn me to a sub-par life as a dependent of the state, but I still think they have their uses. And if at first you don't succeed (in convincing the gatekeepers to ""let you through"") then try again! That's not ""fair"", but neither is life. We do live in a society, after all. There has to be some consensus on certain things.

Edit: maybe I should finally broach the bathroom topic here. So yeah, personally, I don't feel ""safe"" in female only spaces to begin with. A bathroom is a safe space for me only if if I'm behind the stall door, or even better, in single unit with a lock. People make my life hell, not just men.

However... I respect that there are other females who feel the need for a space free from males. It has to be up to the person who needs a safe space to define the terms of said space. That's why I have zero issues with something like the Michigan Womyn's Festival or anywhere else where the rules are female born women only. Bathrooms, though... Sometimes people just have to pee. We use the opposite gender's bathroom if we really have to go. Probably the best case scenario is to have more locked, single gender neutral bathrooms. That's a reasonable compromise. I don't think we have a choice but to compromise, and that is where I differ from many of you, most likely. It's really important to me that all reasonable people get their needs met in public life, because then they're less likely to bother me! Seriously. It's really important that there is a system in place that works even if a few stray individuals don't cooperate. The world could stand to be designed better. Good design means less conflict. If there were some way that people who disagree could just stay out of each other's way, that would be ideal.

Oh, and if misogynistic men could just go to an island and fuck each other until they all die out, that'd be cool. Then we wouldn't need to worry about males in women's bathrooms, because being male wouldn't be an inherent threat. Most men/males are fine. The ones who aren't are the problem, as well as those who condone their psychopathy.

Edit 2: oh, and I should answer this question, too: does passing *actually* make a trans person a woman/man? That really depends on how we define those terms. By one definition (you're born one sex and you die that sex, and gender isn't a thing), no, obviously not. But by another definition (you can be born one sex and have a different gender) then sure, you can effectively ""be"" your chosen gender. People have different ideas about this. According to Pew Research, most Americans don't believe that one can be born a female and ""be"" a man *. But many do. Personally, IDGAF. I think it's fascinating, don't get me wrong. I enjoy thinking about what makes someone a woman, or a man. I don't ""feel like"" either, but I know I'm a woman, because I was born female and I have a female body. Other people have different ideas. In some ways, it's up to the individual to decide. But good luck convincing the majority of something they don't already believe. That's not to say that no one should try: we had to fight for gay acceptance, and thank God we did. But it won't be easy, and there are good reasons why. Sometimes you have to rock the boat, but you're in for a rocky ride.

[*] It's actually closer than I remember: 54/44 in favor of sex determined at birth, as of 2017. I'm not seeing a similar survey for more recent years, but I would be curious to see if people have changed their minds at all. The thing is, it's mostly a partisan issue, like so many other things that really shouldn't be :( I don't think it's even useful to look at the phenomenon through a philosophical lens (as the question implies): the practical implications are more important. I can expand on this, but I'm already tacking on lots of edits to this post."

GCdebatesQT,fdltnnh,t1_fdkyiks,1578532227.0,"That would be very awkward, in that case, I won't try to sugar-coat that either.

It's awkward for everyone involved, which is why it seems to me that everyone should cut the other a little slack. It's one of those things where technically, it's only awkward if you make it awkward, and yet... someone has to make it awkward, and then it's awkward.

That's without even getting into the political ramifications of how one handles the pronoun issue. Even without that, it seems likely that unless the trans person somehow goes to bed a man and wakes up a passing trans woman, there will be awkward times ahead. And in that case, there should be some understanding from the rest of society that you can't just snap your fingers and pass. But then the trans person, in turn, needs to understand that until they pass, they should be aware that their existence is making other people feel awkward. That's not fair, but that's how it is. I know that I make people awkward just by being myself: it sucks, I wish I didn't. But I'm not trans and it's still not fair for me; it's not fair that any individual has to play along with the collective sometimes. But I'm trying to work around it, so I know it's possible to be somewhat accommodating of society without losing your personal integrity in the process. 

I'm putting a lot of emphasis on passing, but it's the only way I can make a distinction. And I try not to have a narrow view of what can count as passing: the way I'm asking myself whether someone can pass isn't so much ""am I buying that this person was born a woman?"" More like ""am I buying that this person is trying to live as a woman does, in good faith?"". So it's a subjective call, as someone might pass to one person, while another clocks them. I guess it's also a judgement call as to what ""living as a woman"" means. And hopefully the answer to that question is at least somewhat flattering, as imitation is supposed to be. It's unfortunate that sometimes it is the opposite of flattering, to say the least (Yaniv, etc). But then some trans women pull it off well. 

I'm wondering if there may be something existential about the whole gender situation. I'm critical of it's existence in a metaphysical way, but I do think it has an existence in practice. And this whole trans situation is society trying to sort that out, what it means to be seen as a gender, vs to be a gender, and is there any difference? I don't really know, but it does have a practical existence that's independent of how anyone thinks about it individually. Because we base some of our ideas about ourselves upon the way people treat us, it's hard to separate the genderless subject from the gendered object. Gender is forced on the object whether they like it or not. Ideally, this would never constrict someone. So if someone really feels that they could flow through the social world more smoothly if people treated them as the other gender, I say they may as well give it a try. I'm glad I didn't: I'm sure the only thing worse (to *me*) than being a woman is being a female who's a man. But inexplicably, it works for some people. I doubt that it works for most people (there's a lot of confusion about this lately), but it really does seem to be the right choice for others. I wish there were an exact science, so that there wouldn't be so much human carnage as we all try to figure out this gender mess."

That's why we so badly need reasonable trans people to set a good example. I don't like how speaking out about even the slightest difference of opinion will get a cool tran accused of having internalized transphobia.

Most GC reddfems think of examples where trans women appear as men in dresses, and so claim ""political integrity"" when refusing to comply with preferred pronouns. But the opposite scenario can happen just as easily. I'm not going to go out of my way to call someone like Buck Angel she out of moral righteousness, when my brain registers ""**DUDE""**. Of course, I know Buck is female, and I'll never see him as a ""real"" man because of it, but my mind is automatically going to reach for the masculine gender (gender, as in grammatical gender, I'm thinking in Frenglish here) when referring to that person! It's ultimately not that deep.

Exactly my sentiment. I would feel absolutely silly calling Buck ""she"". It would feel convoluted and unnatural.

It sucks that TRAs have made this into a political issue, but the way I deal is by doing things the way I always have, and using the pronoun that first comes into my head. For a real trans person (who's done at least *something* to pass, to sell the idea of themselves as their preferred gender) the pronoun that usually jumps to mind is their preferred pronoun."
GCdebatesQT,fdjwbze,t1_fdjnben,1578489610.0,"Why do you believe pronouns to be sex based?

I don't believe we should be forced to use them, either, but in my experience, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, we usually refer to it as a duck.

Meaning that passing trans people get called their preferred pronoun anyway, regardless of their actual biological sex.

I don't see a reason to do things any differently. Blaire White pointed out to Ben Shapiro that if they were planning to meet at a restaurant, and Ben came in later, he wouldn't say to the host ""I'm here to meet that man over there, *him*"" and point at Blaire. Because then there would likely be confusion. Anything to avoid more confusion in social situations, I say.

I also don't believe that calling someone ""she"" amounts to conceding that they are a ""real woman"" (a natal woman); more just like: good job, you pass! I don't really care if the TRAs think that using preferred pronouns is a concession, because to me, it's not. I'm gonna keep using pronouns the way I always have: based on the sex someone *appears* to be. It would be going out of my way to make a conscious effort to call passing trans women ""he"".

I respect people's right to refer to others as they see fit, but I don't agree that pronouns can really be said to be sex based. Maybe for some people they are, but for me, they're definitely not. Just want to put that out there.

Edit: maybe actually answer my question, instead of just downvoting. That's very easy, isn't it? Why bother engaging someone else's POV when you can just downvote and be out? Maybe read the sidebar while you're at it. 

Seriously, I hope you can see that: no one has given me any reason to believe we use pronouns based on sex, so as far as I'm concerned, *we don't*. If you can argue that we do, I'll listen. So go ahead: convince me that we do. We certainly usually do, *because most people aren't trans*, duh. So usually, he = male, and she = female. Obviously. But we absolutely give people the benefit of the doubt: we don't demand to see genitals or a chromosome test. For all we know, we're calling a lot of male people ""she"" and vice versa... Because in polite society, *there's no way to tell for sure*. I don't make the rules, anyway: don't shoot the messenger! I really don't like just how damn sure of itself either GC or QT is: consider for a second that someone else might know something you don't. I feel like I might have to start getting a little bitchy, but I'll try my best not to. Emotions might get heated here, I realize that, as it's a touchy subject. But that doesn't mean we can't try to see the other side's POV. Otherwise, why bother? Why not just kill ourselves, if we don't even try to resolve our differences?

Yeah, tbh, that's my issue with GC, too. Of course there are bad actors: but are the majority of male people bad? Is their socialization really that intense? I don't think so. I guess you could answer, as you are MTF. I've never been socialized as a male, but it seems likely that biology plays a role in sociopathic behavior, not only socialization. I mean, not just ""likely"": that's been proven, I think. Everyone is socialized differently, too. There are similarities, but technically, many of the answers GC gives as blanket statements only actually apply to a pretty small group of individuals. I don't think misogyny is normal, despite being normalized in some pockets of society. It's not explicitly condoned, and that's a huge detail that GC usually wipes away. It's more like a large scale gaslighting effort: ""do as I say, not as I do"" is the usual message we get from the media about misogyny. Denying that rape is a widespread problem on the one hand, and condemning it as the very worst crime, while still implying that rapists and murderers and thieves are hiding in every alleyway. People are confused, and that's probably exactly the point. The corporations benefit from sensationalism and polarization, but the people lose (women and men alike).

As for my issue with QT, it's mostly just that I'm turned off by the ""branding"". I have always liked queerness, even before I knew there was a name for it, or even considered that I might count as a queer person myself. But nowadays, ""queer"" is pretty much synonymous with a certain authoritarian faction of the left, so I don't like to associate with the label. I've considered before that the word queer is due for another reclamation, a re-branding. So I guess I am on board with QT only in it's very basic, fundamental sense.

With radical feminism, I feel kind of the opposite. The fundamentals of radical feminism seem sketchy to me: I don't believe it's useful to lump in everything bad that happens to women under the header of ""patriarchy"". I think it's way more complex than that. I also think we have power; and no, not just sexual ""power"" either. We aren't as weak as much of society would have us believe. However... When I look at the state of liberal feminism today, I go running to read Feminist Current. Porn isn't ""empowering"". It's not ""kink shaming"" to suggest that when a woman is into something like DDLG or the worst kinds of BDSM that maybe something isn't right. I mostly just hate to see women being degraded, especially if they appear to be doing it willingly. So I really appreciate radfem media criticism.

So I'm just not ideologically identified in either direction, though I see useful things in both camps. I've just been more into learning about GC lately. QT is something I'm guessing I'll need to look to back on, to find the most useful parts. I've been meaning to read Judith Butler for a while now.

>Personally I wouldn't mind there being some id law. For instance my driver's license requires I wear corrective lenses. I have a little marker on the back. you say your trans talk to a doctor, when you start to transition add it to your driver's license just the same as that. I think it should remain till your ""done"", that's hard to judge so I would leave that for a doctor or lawyer to deside on that one though.

I guess I agree with both of those things. Definitely the first one.Though I'm sure some would say that that's literally like a Nazi concentration camp badge 🙄

And yeah, self-ID could be the first step in one's transition. Kind of like how if you're depressed, first you have to, well, *identify yourself* as a depressed person before you see a therapist. What I'm not sure about is how far into transition self-ID alone should get you. Should it be enough to get bottom surgery? Maybe, as long as you are over 25, and I know that's awfully late, but the brain continues developing until around that age. Perhaps I'm just overly cautious, but I tend to cry when I hear the stories of detrans people. The idea of one of these teenage girls with ROGD cutting off their boobs... It just sounds so barbaric. I believe ROGD is a thing, unfortunately. I can't know for sure, but if I were 18 right now I'd probably think I was trans. Actually, if I were 5 right now I'd definitely think I was trans. But I'm not: I do have some kind of gender dysphoria, but I think there are other ways to deal with it besides transition. But it's not as strong as the GD actual trans people have. If I were into that sort of thing, I'd probably say I was NB. But I reject the whole idea of NB, as I think it can be pretty sexist, and it can effectively erase both butch lesbians and twinky gay boys, as well as many other flavors of GNC people. 

We haven't yet been able to pinpoint the difference between being gay and being trans. There are probably borderline cases, and in that case, I guess it is up to the individual. I just wish we knew more about it, but there's been so much effort to show that trans and gay aren't the same thing (which is true, they aren't) that you rarely hear it mentioned that even so, they are *related*. They aren't 100% separate, distinct phenomena. There's some overlap: the Venn diagram isn't two separate circles. Some sexologists have been studying this, but I guess it's not PC to do so :("
GCdebatesQT,fdbz2fi,t1_fdbvteh,1578264069.0,You read a lot into my comment that I never actually said.
GCdebatesQT,fdbyyr2,t1_fdbvteh,1578264016.0,"Never said it was ""mysterious"". I don't think we can deny that gender and sex and sexuality and sexual orientation are some of the most complex parts of the human experience.

I'm talking about the whole thing: sex, gender, everything. Yeah, it's pretty fucking complicated. That's why they're probably mangling trans people with risky surgery and stuff. I don't think they've figured out enough yet, empirically, to just put forth transition as ""the only cure for gender dysphoria"". If at all possible, don't mess with mother nature; she doesn't fuck around."
GCdebatesQT,fda1hp7,t1_fd9tncw,1578240629.0,"Personally, I don't think bottom surgery should be necessary. I am pro-penis (and pro-vagina, of course): penises don't rape people, people (usually men) do. And I dislike the idea of someone undergoing major surgery on such a delicate part of the body if it's not absolutely necessary.

If it were socially acceptable for women to sometimes have penises, and for men to sometimes have vaginas, I think that would be just fine. Idk if it ever will be socially acceptable, and I recognize that some people are grossed out by that idea, but I don't find it gross; just different. The same way I'd like the words ""he"" and ""she"" to be less polarized, I'd like human anatomy to be less polarized as well. As in, a penis doesn't have to serve as a symbol of male domination any more than a vagina has to serve as a symbol of female oppression. They're just body parts.

It's fine if you want to have the surgery anyway, don't get me wrong. I know most (?) trans people have some level of genital dysphoria. I just think that probably hormones are the most important thing, and I guess clothing/general presentation is second to that (as in, accentuating feminine characteristics). It's just that I would hope that a trans woman who doesn't want to get bottom surgery doesn't feel like she *has* to, like her penis is this offensive thing in and of itself. Having said that, she should still probably not strip naked in the middle of the local YMCA. There are usually stalls or curtains, luckily. And if there aren't, probably go into a bathroom to change or something. I mean, I do, even as a natal woman. I don't want to run around flashing my actual genitals or even pubic hair, but being topless in a locker room is ok for me, personally. I'm pretty self-conscious, so I'm not going to be the one to advocate for more public nudity, even in women only spaces.

And I agree that eventually, it would be ideal for society in general to treat people in as gender-neutral a manner as possible. I never ""sir"" or ""miss/ma'am"" people, so that's no problem for me. I'm honestly kind of amazed that we still do it at all, as a society. There's more of it in certain areas, though, like the closer you get to the southern US states. I think we should mind our business about other people's genders. I sometimes see people who I can't tell what gender they are, and I think... hm, I hope no one misgenders them, that would be awkward. They might not even be trans: some people are just naturally very androgynous. So yeah, besides the obvious situations like in the doctor's office, where biological sex is literally a life and death matter, I agree we don't need to gender everyone.

That's why I'm not really GC or QT, though I agree with much of what GC in particular has to say. I was on board with much of QT until around 2010: I think it's gotten too big for it's britches and it's taken over academia. But I mostly agree with the performative theory of gender. Maybe just with some caveats. And I support real, actual trans people in all the important ways, just within reason. Trans women likely picked up some bad habits from male socialization, and trans men likely picked up some internalized misogyny from the culture at large. But I don't think that invalidates their gender: it's more just something that I'd hope they're aware of. But I don't support self-ID legally: in order to be legally designated as a gender different from the sex you were born as, I think it's reasonable to be required to present some form of documentation. Much as it pains me to say it, the medical establishment has to have some say in these matters. That's why I wish we could actually trust the medical establishment. But as it is now, it's better than nothing. There has to be some gatekeeping of some form, is what I'm getting at."
GCdebatesQT,fd9lr2z,t1_fd8uf6b,1578235074.0,"I agree that the OP is pretty much just making the attack helicopter joke argument. This is different: it's gender. And gender, unfortunately, appears to be infinitely more complex than nationality, or any other example.

And I think it is reasonable for individuals to respect other individuals self-ID... to a point! Like you said, they should be expected to do something, to the best of their ability/desire, to signal that they want to be treated as a sex they weren't born as. Simply requesting to be called a certain pronoun just isn't enough. It might be enough for me, personally, because I'm pretty nice and I'm also a coward, never trying to get on people's bad side (provided they aren't being rude to me, then I'm a raging bitch!) But there are people who just aren't going to understand. I think it's reasonable that trans people be expected to... ugh, I hate to say ""pass"", because what if they don't like to look stereotypical? But to make some effort, besides self-ID.

It sounds like you might actually agree with that. But I'm curious as to your take on NB people? I'm always saying that I have absolutely no problem with people *being* NB. However, I can't get behind neo-pronouns, mostly because they don't make any practical sense. I think the whole idea of using different pronouns comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of the way pronouns are actually used in real life.

I also think that neo-pronouns de-legitimize the experiences of regular (""binary"") trans people. Kinda like ContraPoints was saying, before she got into hot water with NB Twitter. When people are pushing for pronouns to be used differently than they have been forever (based on individual self-ID, as opposed to presentation) they seem to make it more difficult for trans people who simply wish to be treated as the gender they transitioned to (often paying a lot of money to do so, to add insult to injury). It's kinda unfair that they do all the work to transition, only to be bitched at for being too binary: essentially, having binary privilege.

Especially when most of the world doesn't even understand regular trans people: they get lumped in with militant NB activists when they're just trying to live their lives. NB is muddying the waters.

Another thing is that most people, cis or trans, aren't binary. We're 3D people, with personality traits and interests that don't fit neatly within the boxes of ""feminine"" or ""masculine"". Sex isn't actually all that important in most cases. That's not to say that it isn't at all important, but it doesn't (or shouldn't) color every single interaction. And someone can appear 100% binary, sexually, while still behaving in a completely gender neutral way (the opposite, too).

I'm going off on a tangent now. I guess my point is that I don't want anyone, cis or trans (which is a false dichotomy anyway) to be restricted by gender. But I still do believe that there's a way that gender has worked forever (which can include trans people) and there's no need to reinvent the wheel. (I'm not talking about patriarchal and/or oppressive gender norms, btw: more just the way pronouns work, the way gendered spaces work, etc.)

But ultimately, I do agree with your point that it's not that difficult to respect someone's self-ID. I think many people still resent it, though, often for good reason. And with NB people, I sometimes think that their self-ID conflicts with *my* self-ID. I don't feel like a woman or a man, either, but I have this female body, and I prefer a slightly feminine aesthetic, so people call me ""miss"", and I respond. Would an NB ""correct"" them? ""Um, actually, I am a genderfluid demi boi and my pronouns are xi/xir"". They probably don't care. They just want to get your attention if you dropped something, so they say ""hey, miss!"" So yeah, it's nice to be nice, and a polite person would say ""ok, you do you, bye now!"" But beyond that... What does it mean to have a nonstandard gender identity socially validated? Is it like a stamp to get parking validated? Seriously, though, if the word ""NB"" doesn't mean anything to Joe Schmo, then why not just let him assume your gender?

Sorry if I'm interrogating you like you're some hardcore QT TRA, when you actually sound very reasonable. It sounds like you recognize that self-ID can be abused. Anyone else can chime in, too. I just wanted to air some grievances that have been building up in me for a while, about the ways I agree with QT and the ways I don't."
GenderCritical,fd3d185,t1_fd12306,1578157057.0,"Do men actually like/watch beauty pageants? I'm honestly not sure who they're for... (Other than for the sponsor's pocketbooks, naturally.)

I think it's only fair that trans women are subjected to the same sexist bullshit that natal women are. Ideally, contests explicitly based on physical appearance wouldn't even exist. But since they still do, I say let in any trans woman who wants to participate in such a creepy, barbaric activity.

Conservative types are (reasonably) offended by ""drag kids"". I think it's because they're only used to seeing women publicly debase themselves, so when a little boy does it, it's especially shocking. But maybe some of them will come around, and realize that it's gross regardless of the sex/gender of the person! And maybe they'll feel similarly about trans women in pageants: maybe it'll open some eyes. 

Luckily, I just read that viewership of pageants has been plummeting steadily for a while now. That's a trend I hope to see continue, until they're not a thing anymore. I mean, isn't real life enough of a beauty contest?"

I'm sincerely happy that someone like her can do so well for herself with the world as it is.

We need to put our money where our mouth is. Financially supporting a cause or project isn't always just paying lip service. I'm well under the poverty line, but I've decided that $2 bucks a month is a reasonable price to pay to support someone whose voice I think should be amplified. That's much different than some Wall Street suit throwing money at a dubious charity so he can wipe his hands clean of his privilege and sleep at night.

The system has problems, obviously. But I'm not so cynical. Most of us try to do the best we can, considering the circumstances. Is it actually praxis? Idk, but it's fucking *something*."
GCdebatesQT,fcxgs90,t1_fcw79ss,1578062536.0,"Oh, good. Yeah, I get that it's sort of based on sex in that women are usually physically weaker than men. And like most myths, stranger danger is loosely inspired by reality (as well as cleverly misdirecting attention from the real abusers: men you know). But the ""curfew"" thing: it's just a rule that begs to be broken!

A better example might be whether women and men stand or sit to pee: definitely based on sex/anatomy, and usually it's not a rule people break, simply for the biological fact of the matter, convenience, and yes, social norms, too.

There are very few examples of actual sex roles. I've tried to come up with more, but besides anything to do with pregnancy, or ejaculation... There are definitely tendencies that people with more estrogen, or more testosterone share, and those could be considered sex roles, except then we're in the territory of condoning and enforcing them, if we decide that gender roles are bullshit, but sex roles are real. Not to mention that this would mean trans people are following sex roles, if they take hormones. Personally, I think they actually are: it's just that there may be some countering sex and gender roles (that they might not even be aware of, unless they're a cool, rebel tran!) that are competing with the sort of ""sex subroutine"" initiated by the hormones. 

The problem is (and this is where I veer off from the usual GC thinking) that there isn't really a sharp distinction. I wish there were: it would make things easier. There are things men tend to do, and things women tend to do. Some of these things are socially constructed, and others appear to be innate. But that's just another false dichotomy: nature and nurture can't be separated out. Not to mention all the exceptions. My guess is that the reality of sex and gender is so much more complex than either QT or GC make out to be. That's why this sub is pretty cool: people just go in to the weeds to try to come up with some kind of explanation for the way things are, some working hypothesis."
GCdebatesQT,fcw6m1r,t1_fcvetqu,1578018343.0,"> not going out after dark

I was with you 100% until this. Kinda like you were saying, there are very few expectations based on gender *or sex* that can't be overridden by the individual. Only problem is that most people are conformist suckers :( And their gender and/or sex norms, explicitly or implicitly condoned (as in, by imitation), have terrible repercussions for the rest of us who are just trying to be ourselves. 

I don't even think gender and sex need to be spoken about differently here: women and men break ""rules"" (even rules based on sex) all the time.

The idea of not going out after dark (alone) as a woman is based on ""stranger danger"", anyway. We're much more likely to be abused by an acquaintance, friend, family member or spouse than by a boogeyman hiding in the bushes. I won't submit to an unspoken curfew, personally; I'll take my chances, as it's my world, too, out there under the moon.

It appears to be lost on the woke mob that it's the very system that they claim to be so critical of (the white-supremacist-capitalist-patriarchy or whatever) that's driven these poor suckers (Trumpers) into his hands.

GCdebatesQT,fch9yw8,t1_fch5nv8,1577648596.0,"There are many things preventing that from happening. Some things have improved, and I think it’s definitely possible to have a society where people can just be themselves. I think one of the biggest impediments is unconscious bias and general ignorance of the assumptions we make. So a lot of the people who hold up these double standards probably don’t even see it that way. We do need to make *some* assumptions: that’s where it gets tricky. From what I can see, most men aren’t thinking to themselves “she’s not smiling... but she’s a woman and women are always supposed to smile! Does not compute!” It’s more likely that they have been socialized in such a way that seeing a woman with a neutral facial expression triggers some kind of inner notion that they need to help her, to fix her, to do *something*. It doesn’t occur to them that a male face would have to be actually frowning to warrant such a reaction in them. So much of our behavior is baked in by the time we’re adults. It’s totally possible to “manually override” our programming, but it takes first awareness, then vigilance. It’s a lot of work: I can see why some would rather stick their head in the sand, or double down and deny that they are making any unwarranted assumptions. It’s very complicated, so I think it’s nearly impossible to assign blame. I don’t hold it against all of the people who hold up gender norms, but I do wish they would stop. Some people definitely deserve blame, don’t get me wrong. But the actual sexists aren’t the only problem, unfortunately. There’s a lot of casual... not sexism, really, but ignorance.

GCdebatesQT,fcga5vm,t1_fcg05pn,1577638019.0,"Existing in the social world *is* effort for me. When people see my female presentation, they expect me to behave in a certain way.

I’m not an activist: “be the change you want to see in the world”. I don’t believe women should be held to a different social standard than men. So I don’t abide by that standard. Hopefully some people take note of this. Whether I have actually effected any change is another issue, but it’s hard enough for me to leave the house, so for now, I don’t have a choice but to *be* the change.

As for who gender harms more: I don’t think we can separate out the harm, because we affect each other. The harm done to women is indeed more overt. But that doesn’t mean that men aren’t being harmed as well. When men are harmed, they sometimes harm women. And sometimes when women are harmed, they harm men. It’s just usually a different kind of harm, but it’s harm nonetheless."
GCdebatesQT,fcg7sdr,t1_fcfpzy6,1577637305.0,"I am an American: I’ve lived on the liberal East Coast my whole life, though, and I’m guessing I’m younger than you because I was only alive for Bush Sr and only really conscious by the time Clinton was elected. I look back at the nineties with rose colored glasses: Nickelodeon ads for slime, marketed to boys and girls of all races. True tomboy fashion was in style (no “boyfriend” jeans, just big old JNCOs for everyone!) Much of mainstream culture since the mid aughts has just been trash, imo. Nickelodeon was pushed aside in favor of the Disney channel, and more Disney values being instilled in that generation of young millennials and gen z. It became common to see ads in feminist magazines like Bust (and even sometimes my beloved Bitch mag) for stores that sold modern pinup girl or fifties housewife style clothing: supposedly that was subversive, but I never saw it that way; it seemed like just more rehashing of tired tropes. It seems like the new millennium has just been reinterpreting the gender bullshit of the old one.

And then there’s the free internet porn epidemic, you’re right. And “sex positive” (but not really positive) “liberal” (but not really liberal) pop feminism that says it’s ok to be a feminist and still get off on being degraded or watching other women be degraded. No thanks!

But on the other hand, sex and gender are finally being discussed: they can’t be ignored. If I’m gonna speculate on the way things are trending, I wouldn’t say that misogyny is actually more common, more that it is now out in the open, and can’t be ignored by the mainstream anymore. Same thing with Trump: the undesirable elements of American culture came to the forefront. In a way, Trump and his supporters are like the fever, where the underlying resentment is like the flu. But many of his supporters would never call themselves misogynistic. I’m not sure how they justify their support for him, but they do. People can justify almost anything.

On the plus side, we’re just generally more woke, but in the original sense; meaning *aware* of race and gender issues. But the woke police are a horrible counter reaction to Trump types, who are themselves are a reaction to society waking up, to social progress.

I guess I just see a lot of misdirected anger at the wrong people, imo. You seem reasonable about it: I get now that you weren’t trying to imply misogyny was the only issue. Or even that the situation is all bad... I don’t think. We’ve made a lot of progress, and with progress comes its own set of problems. It’s almost like we’re dealing with a second wave of misogyny. To me, the general sentiment of misogynistic types today has a different ring to it than the old school, boy’s club style misogyny. They seem threatened by women now, whereas the traditional patriarchy was really sure of itself. It’s very difficult to argue that women are subhuman in this day and age, because we’ve proven ourselves to be competent and capable of competing with men in the public arena. Maybe the word I am looking for is “backlash”. I know that book came out back in the day, so maybe we’re now actually in a third wave of backlash. I think that’s significant. Calling it backlash certainly doesn’t excuse it, but it does put it in context. There’s a constant push and pull, and ideally, the struggle between both camps kind of iterates, a little different each time. So idk, I guess I’m also cautiously optimistic, like the OP.

I do want to gather my thoughts about the issues with putting down men that I see in radical feminism. I just want to make sure to phrase it in such a way that I don’t appear to be conflating misogyny and misandry: they are apples and oranges. Or maybe rotten apples and oranges. There is a stark asymmetry between the results of misogyny vs the results of misandry (the results of misandry are a lot more subtle, usually, whereas misogyny has an overt negative impact). So I will eventually get around to writing a whole new post about it!"
GCdebatesQT,fcfm7ac,t1_fccm4ce,1577631592.0,"> Misogyny is growing stronger in society, not weaker.

I don't think that's something that can be said, for sure. I'll just say it: what counts as ""misogyny"" is somewhat subjective, around the grey areas (I'm well aware of the extremes). Not to mention that it's a kind of trend that we can't gather accurate data on, because ~~no one~~ most people don't self-ID as ""misogynist"". And by ""society"": which part of society?

Maybe incels, etc are the symptom, not the disease. Maybe there's something beyond ""partisan gender politics"" that has implications for all of us, regardless of sex.

Sorry to be so nitpicky, but I don't like to see broad generalizations being made that ""round down"" so to speak, not factoring in nuance. We have a gender crisis afoot: that's readily apparent. But men lose in the gender game, too: we *all* lose. Gender is harmful to children and all living things (or however the saying about war goes). Not just women. If men seem to benefit more from the status quo... Well, try and see it from their perspective. They get told from day one that they're harmful: maybe it's a self-fufilling prophecy?

I've avoided coming out in favor of men and masculinity here, but fuck it. I'll probably make a post about it sometime, as I've been meaning to. ***Women and men are hurting***. No one wins the gender game: not in the long run.
