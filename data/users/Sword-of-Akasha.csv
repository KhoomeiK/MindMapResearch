I've had some bad therapists. I've manage to get a decent one after a while of many tries. Don't know how long that shall last. Selective pressure means the good ones will move on to better positions after cutting their teeth here down below. Government insurance sucks. Even with my therapist I must keep my secret heart. Believe me, mandatory psychiatric hospitalization is brutal.

I'm a game's writer so I understand escapism. My characters are my friends, deeply flawed ones but at heart good, I focus on moral complexity so I have antagonists rather than villains. It's ironic, I write dark stories with a light at the end of them... yet in real life we stumble forever in darkness chasing willow wisps and illusory reflections of true light. I'm actually stuck on writer block right now. I’ve reached a Bolivian Army ending scenario… in the middle of my story hahahaha. There is a point where strength of will and individual skill cannot overcome the overwhelming raw reality of numbers."

I'm thankful for social support services, they try, however, they're overworked, underpaid, and must remain detached and apathetic to a degree in order to function. In the US there's a crisis and we seem to demonize the desperate and most vulnerable while cutting their resources. I've had to fight to find even mediocre care. 

In my personal life, I've found myself often the shoulder that others cry to... when I am stranded and feel poorly everyone becomes busy. Perhaps people mistake kindness for weakness and I naturally attract users and abusers. Maybe it's been bad luck."

You see the tradition continued today. Where to the police patrol more often than where they receive their tax revenue from. When they need arrest numbers they make forceful forrays into blighted areas. Response rate is significantly lower in such zones as to keep officers safe and after the crime has been committed. Meanwhile a colored person so much as standing in a white area shall be swiftly and violently ejected less he can explain his presence and provide identification in a so called 'public area'.

It's all smokescreen and distraction, you've hit the nail on the head.

The world is in desperate need of erudite individuals such as yourself that are able to see above and beyond the toxic fog generated by Fox News and the Religious Right.

I live in the Yankee North and there's only a thin layer of liberal. Scratch and you'll see hateful Fox News supporters all around.

Conservatives nowadays seem to bloat the budgets and only pay lip service to their ideology. ""Less government"" just translates into ""more corporation"". Given the option they'll privitize everything. I'm astonished private prisons are a thing. We already live in a two tier justice system.

The internet *was* a wonderous things. In the wild west days you could be exposed to contrary opinions and the best ideas would emerge in the dialectic struggle. This was anathema to the Power Structure. So filter bubbles came to be. You only saw what you wanted to see and algorithms ensured you be fed that on a steady drip keeping you stupified. Search engine optimization means even when you look for controversial things, only the corporate sponsored ones will be on top. With the death of Net Neutrality, they can go further and slow down sites that don't pay up. Like cows corralled into pens. We can moo to each other, however, the no cow the next farm over can hear.

What is immediate apparent to minorities is invisible to others because they've never experienced it. They get angry thinking that you're diminishing their 'hard work' or you're 'belly aching'. They don't realize that you don't have to be wearing a KKK white hood to be racist, racism is more subtle and coded now. These people will denouce the KKK member but when it comes to the edge in the job market they recieve based upon their race they'll only attribute it based upon their merits.

Equality on paper doesn't help when the reality is far from equality. There's a vicious feedback too. The inequality created skews crime statistics. A civil rights leader lamented once he'd be more at ease seeing a white person in a dark alley than a member of his own race. The media loves to appeal to its white audience by further skewing the perception of crime. Fox News finds the few colored persons who are the exception then parade them about and make them mouth pieces to the ""Racism is over narrative"".

Ultimately racial tensions have been always fermented by the upper classes in order to control the lower. These systems are designed to foster resentment since scape goats are great for diverting attention from the Robber Barons reborn into our modern century. All races are fighting over scraps whilst our corporate overlords hog over the plate of plenty.

\-Look for card skimmers at a gas station pump. Give the card reader a little shake to see if it should come loose. 

\-Check if the skimmer is inside the pump. Many gas stations have put tamper tape seals nowadays so that if the panel has been opened they'll know. The tape peels leaving an impression with part of the tape still on. Sure scammers can buy tape, but could they buy the exact brand?

\-If it's an option use a gas pump that is in the immediate view of the gas station. Those facing away would more likely be the ones rigged. 

\-Even with due diligence I was taken by a gas station skimmer when I traveled through. They're always evolving their methods. Luckily the card company reversed everything.

Emotional strength, that’s not clear cut either, once bitten twice shy comes into play too. Some people never ‘get back up’ they end up crawling.

To quote Clint Eastwood. “Deserve has nothing to do with it.” Life is fundamentally unfair. Many shall be born into horrific suffering and die in the same such situation. Telling people they deserve such and such doesn’t do much but remind them about how fucked up the system is.

Sorry if I appear to be lashing out, it’s just nauseating to be surrounded by the cult of positivity. In our hyper capitalistic dystopian nightmare you have to be insane to be happy when you’re scraping in the dirt."

Nerf,fc296xw,t1_fc28czv,1577346537.0,"Roughcut aesthetically seems pretty kicking. Thanks for the insight into the performance. Still I'm going to stick with the Liberator hahahah if there was some way to mash two Liberators togethers for double barrels, then it'd be doubly awesome. 

The inability to reload in the field against a team using different ammo would be a huge downside to the Twinshock.

Some folks are fps fanatics, I think since we're talking about shotgun style blasters, fun is the priority."
Nerf,fc27mco,t1_fc26js6,1577344172.0,"I encountered the double loading issue. It occurs when people don't close the loading gate and pump it. If you close the slide first before the first pump, it should feed correctly. The performance drop off at range is very noticeable... but it's shotgun so I think that's to be expected. 

Hmmmm as to an actual blast of multiple darts or rival rounds, I'm not sure there are satisfactory blasters yet at a low enough price point. The Trilogy I read in reviews was underwhelming in performance and fussing about with collecting shells after each firing sounds irritating."
Nerf,fc1pzog,t1_fc1pq79,1577326059.0,"I've seen some of the custom nerf shotties, I'm impressed but the price point is way above what I can afford to play with... lol for that price you can have two squads outfitted with Liberators and have ammo. Also the loading gate for liberator is very reminiscent of a real boomstick."
Nerf,fc1phl0,t3_efnkrj,1577325609.0,I'd say the Liberator is still the best shotgun around in aesthetics and functionality. It's not nerf though.

confession,fbzg5i9,t1_fbz571p,1577245579.0,"Yeah, hmmm they could have undiagnosed mental disabilities. Mental medical science was at its infancy then and even now is rather dodgy. Brain scans are for the rich. The pill they throw are like attempting to do surgery with a claymore sword rather than a scalpel. There's bloody side effect. You never know if there was tumor pressing against your rational thought centers until they autopsy you.

Crime though is rather inexcuseable save for when you need bread to feed your kids. I knew some shop lifters back in highschool, they only ever targeted the big corporate stores. I'm not sure what crimes you talk about so that's another gray zone. White collar criminals do greater societal damage than actual traditional crime. The greatest theft is wage theft where employers steal time from their employees.

Jobs have also gotten progressively worse. You really only progress up the ladder by going laterally jumping to another company. Average job ain't but 4-5 years. The old style of staying and being recognized no longer applies. Shopping around is something you have to do down low when the boss isn't looking, since despite all the corporate family talk we're just replaceable cogs to them."
confession,fbz4wn1,t1_fbz446o,1577235169.0,"Then I imagine they weren't 'smart' then. Some conflate the appearance of intelligence for actual intelligence. There's factual understanding and there's such things as emotional intelligence. Some folks are smart in their area and nothing else. How did you reckon they were 'High IQ'? Did they tell you their scores? Even with tests you cannot tell completely. Shrugs, how well did you know them outside the forced interactions at school?"
confession,fbz3o4h,t1_fbytkz9,1577234106.0,"Maybe instead of that you should consider that folks come up from different circumstances. Intelligence won't matter much if you don't have the opportunity. Some people have to take care of their parents and family, or maybe there was a crisis. Most folks in America are one medical bill away from bankruptcy. The majority of wealth is inherited. Being smart to realize it just makes it worse when you know that there are things you cannot overcome."
povertyfinance,fbz1lmk,t1_fbyygu1,1577232346.0,"Revolutions have typically been led by those that paid lip service to the peasants but secretly their only objection to the ruling regime is that they're not in charge. The 'Revolution' is now another market commodity. They sell Che Guevera t-shirts at the mall made by a supply chain of slavery and misery. Propaganda has convinced people to blame scape goats like minorities and immigrants while the super rich do the true pillaging. 

The super rich mean while are trying to create absolutely loyal robot slaves or designers babies so that they might enliminate the working class and rule in perpetuity without fear of ""Revolution"". Why should we share the wealth and all live modest humble lives when the .01% may live as gods of their new eden."

povertyfinance,fbxomhh,t3_ef1fen,1577196009.0,"Studies have shown poverty effects your brain. The continual stress diminishes your mental capacity. We've always got that guilotine of an unexpected bill, accident, or illness that will fall upon our heads. It's nerve wracking to say the least. People born to wealth don't understand till they're down on their luck. Some are only visitors to poverty and forget quickly their shame... others become permanent inhabitants and the thoughts of the past become pain that drains them further.

It isn't talked about by state and corporate media is that this topic is a big crack in the myth of meritocracy. This myth sustains our vastly unequal system and ignores the great advantages at birth that the spawn of the super rich enjoy. It's pay to win. You notice now because you're on the ground. High in the sky, the rich like to lie to everyone and themselves that they've achieved only through their own merits. It justifies their wages and the system that perpetuates such disparity. Control is instituted by lottery that convinces the laboring class that they're only temporarily embarassed millionaires to be."
lostgeneration,fbxk1zu,t1_fbv7acw,1577191168.0,People don't realize how at a certain threshold of wealth it's self sustaining since you can hire people to manage your empire and corrupt politicians in your favor.
lostgeneration,fbxjzqh,t1_fbvfn96,1577191090.0,Not really. Buying politicians pays tremendous dividends and it's dirt cheap compared to if they were to pay the super rich were to pay their share not even their fair share since the law is already in their favor.

depression,fbxdns4,t3_eez5x3,1577181842.0,"Lots of people have been sad, which they think equals depressed. It really irritates me too when they tell people to ""get over it"" as if lifelong trauma was the same as losing your pet hamster. Then there are people who think they're depressed but are just sad. Makes me angry when I hear folks crying over spilled milk. Spilled milk could be the straw that broke the camel's back... but just the milk... that's just insulting for us all that got physical scars to go with the mental. So some people do require perspective. Then there are people who makes their own hell and only drag you down with them.

It's a case by case basis as you stated. We all need more compassion for others."

I feel obsessing about such things gives the monsters in our lives power. Granted we cannot help the unwanted invasion of our thoughts but ultimately we can control to a degree what we see when we close our eyes.

When I’m lonely I think how terrible it was when I was with bad people. This at least assuages some of that pain. There’s predators that love to prey upon the lonely. Good people are elusive, please take care of yourself."
