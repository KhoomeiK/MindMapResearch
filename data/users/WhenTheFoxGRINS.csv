""Oh man, my biggest weakness?""  Pretend to spare half a moment to think on it - if you answer right away it can make you come off as scripted.  ""I guess I sometimes can get a bit too invested in things...  I always want to get the job in front of me done in the absolute *best* way possible.  When I can't afford to give something my all, I tend to get upset with myself, knowing I could have done better.  I wouldn't say I'm a perfectionist necessarily, but I still realize that sometimes I may set the bar a bit unrealistically high and occasionally need to dial that back just a little bit.""

**You acknowledged your weakness.**

*You give everything your best, even when you know that you realistically can't go above and beyond with every single task.*

**You mention that you tend to get down on yourself when you fall to this weakness.**

*This not only shows that you have a sense of awareness of yourself, but that you naturally strive to improve yourself.*

**You let them know that beyond acknowledging this weakness, and how you react to it, that you're actively working on *improving* that weakness.**

*You can assess a situation's needs and adjust to whatever you need to do to most realistically deal with it.*

Of course, you can pick anything you'd like, but it's important not to just say what your weakness is and let it go.  *Always* tell them that you're actively striving to overcome that weakness!  So not only are you expressing that 1) you're not perfect, 2) you acknowledge that, and 3) you're working to improve yourself regardless."

GoForGold,ffegf0r,t3_et30y9,1579847007.0,"Phew, okay.  First and foremost, let the doctor know as soon as possible about your fear.  If possible, maybe even call ahead of the appointment - this might further drive home how serious you are.  Many people are afraid of needles, but not as often to such extremes.  You *need* to let them know exactly how bad it is, or the doctor may very well underestimate the situation.

Be open, honest, and yes, vulnerable.  It may sound a little gimmicky, but if they can empathize with you and/or feel real sympathy for your situation, they'll likely be much more careful and friendly towards you.  In a sense, showing that vulnerability reminds them that you're only human, and despite the fact that they're sticking needles in people day in and day out without much thought, they'll reevaluate what to them is likely a simple, thoughtless task and what it means to *you.*

A good doctor can make conversation to distract you.  Even if you *know* that they're trying to distract you, just roll with it.  They'll likely ask you questions that will require more than a simple yes or no response, something to get you talking and focused on whatever that point of conversation is.  Go along with it.  Focus on being casual and friendly, and try to keep a relatively light-hearted atmosphere.  How to do that?  Fake it.  Pretend that this is just a regular walk in the park for you, that it's no big deal.  It's honestly quite amazing what we as humans can convince ourselves with just a little persuasion.  We're more likely to believe whatever it is that we *want* to believe.

Okay, this is an important one.  Do **NOT** look at the needle.  Not even once.  Tell them right away that you don't want to see it at *any* point.  All you need to do is look elsewhere.  Don't close your eyes - that'll just psych you out.  Just let your eyes focus on one thing in the room, in the opposite direction of where the doctor is standing.  It can be anything - maybe a picture on the wall or a sink or a computer screen.  You don't need to look at them as you talk or make any eye contact - it's not rude in this situation.  They'll be understanding.

And I know that this part is scary, like, really scary,  but let them know that you don't want to know when it's going to happen.  This seems like the opposite of what you might want, because you want to prepare yourself, right?  But in fact, ""preparing yourself"" is only going to draw your focus to what you don't want to see or think about, and it'll make you instinctively tense up.  There's a reason they tell you to relax.  If you tense up, it's going to hurt a bit more than it would otherwise.  Doing everything I've mentioned so far will only aid you in doing this though.  No need to repeat a mantra of ""relax"" in your head, as again, that often has the opposite of the desired effect.

To recap, or tldr:

- Let the doctor know about your situation in advance.  Calling ahead and then bringing it up again when you meet in person is a safe bet.

- Be sincere.  Be vulnerable.  Allow them to realize that no matter what your sex/gender, age, race, or status, that ultimately you're just human and you have legitimate fears.

- Make conversation.  Be friendly.  Fake a positive and easygoing attitude as best you can - like an actor in a movie.

- Do **not** look at the needle.  Ever.

- Pick an object or spot in the room away from what the doctor is doing and let yourself just relax and focus on that.  Do not close your eyes.

- Tell them that you do **not** want any warning beforehand.  You'll only make yourself tense with the anticipation, which will make you more uncomfortable in the end.

Final note: When I say ""doctor,"" I'm referring to whoever it might be that gives you the shot.  They may actually be a nurse or just an assistant, but no worries - anyone in that position has worked hard and are qualified to take care of you!

Best of luck!!"

AskReddit,ffdnvi0,t3_esse9d,1579824868.0,"When I was maybe about 19 and poor as dirt, my fiance and I had just boarded a public bus to get back home.  We'd just finished grocery shopping and each had several bags in each hand. 

On one of the stops, I was jerked a bit too hard (we were standing) and I dropped a jar of peanut butter accidentally.  It rolled across the floor and a man reached down and thankfully stopped it from going under the seats.  He then smiled and handed it back to me.

He was very dark skinned, which was uncommon where I was living at the time, and he was dressed a bit strangely - though if I were asked to explain how, I don't think I could really put my finger on it.

He introduced himself as ""Angel,"" and I remember thinking that couldn't be his real name, but it was unique enough that I never forgot it, so.  We thanked him and we made a bit of small talk, but nothing too memorable beyond that.  When we got off the bus, he wished us a ""blessed day"" and we never saw him again.

As for *why* I'll always remember this guy, I'm not entirely sure.  I remember wondering if he might have been a real angel, despite the fact that I'm not really religious in any way.  He just had a unique name, aura, and pleasant disposition that didn't entirely line up with how he appeared.  Very similar to a ""gentle giant"" in a way.

This was of course before I'd moved from small town Pennsylvania to big city California.  Living in LA, I've since met and have become accustomed to meeting outstanding and unique people, to say the least.  But for whatever reason, Angel always stuck with me.

Hope you're having a good life out there, Angel!"

As for what I plan to do in an emergency - well, I keep a pair of lounge pants and a large T-shirt right next to my bed, typically so I can put something on when I get up in the mornings.  If there's a fire or an earthquake, all I really have to do is grab my shirt, wake up my fiance, and run out of the house.

There's a certain standard or sanctity to this site that does make it a bit less ""mainstream,"" and I understand not wanting to have it overrun by rampant emoji-spamming, likes-hounding, braindead idiots, but I think it's all a matter of extremes ultimately.

I will agree that those types of comments are obnoxious, annoying, and cringe as hell.  They're just meaningless spam.  If you don't have anything of actual wit or substance to contribute, and/or you're spamming emojis like a spastic child (no offense to spastic children; they're allowed to act like that to an extent), I can completely understand why they'd subsequently be downvoted.

Also, that ""FB meme"" is painful to look at and reminds me of early 2000's internet memes made by 11-year-olds trying to be cute and witty.  Guess they never left - just huddled up over away FB.  Yeah, stolen content?  They can have it."

Anyone who is actually familiar with the crisis we as a species face with overpopulation would likely agree with me. 

We're not China.  We don't have way too many elderly, so much so that there's literally not enough young people around to assist them in their old age.  We have more than enough young people for that.  If not within the younger units of the family, then through geriatric care centers and personal home health aides.

It's actually a dream of mine to care for the elderly as a career.  I have a lot of respect for them, for all they've been through and all they continue to go through.  Just the sheer amount of change they must have experienced over their lifetimes floors me.  I'd be honored to help take care of them, help extend their own independence longer, and be a friend or just a listening ear to hear any stories they'd like to tell.

The problem, at least for me anyways, is that I need a solid chunk of education and training (in the US) to do this.  I need to be capable of taking care of other human lives.  You have to help in so many ways - sometimes you're a maid, cleaning dishes, laundry, taking out the trash, or picking up around the house.  Sometimes you're a cook, preparing multiple appropriate meals and snacks a day.  Sometimes you're a nanny - you help them dress, undress, shower, use the restroom, and get in and out of bed.  You also need to be educated in proper medical care, like knowing how to do CPR, the heimlich maneuver, as well as organizing and distributing the *exact* right amounts of their medication at the right times.

I'm not above doing any of these things, nor paying for the ridiculous cost of educating myself within the US system.  What I do have trouble with is the fact that elderly care takers are spending their full days and often many nights taking care of these lives, but we're paid barely any more than what a burger flipper makes.

And I truly mean no offense to burger flippers, truly - but how am I realistically going to support my spouse and our children in one of the most expensive states to live in in the US making only that of what a fast food restaurant server makes?  How will I realistically pay back the debt for gaining the education and training necessary to take care of others?  Whilst also paying off my mortgage, my car, paying for health insurance, car insurance, and life insurance, retirement savings, emergency savings, holiday and birthday gifts, vacations, paying for my kids to grow up in a safe neighborhood and attend a good school, while also saving up for their own college educations, amongst the many, many other expenses of just being alive?

So to bring this all back around, I don't think we need to be concerned necessarily with having enough hands on deck to take care of our aging population, but rather I believe that we just need to make getting education more plausible and paying our medical care workers a proper, living wage.

Because it doesn't pay, I'm not going to be going into geriatric care like I wanted.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been faced with this situation.  If you're not going to give the younger population any incentive at all to want to take care of the elderly, then, why would they?  If it won't allow them to pay the bills, then I can't really blame them in the end.

Overpopulation is an issue.

AskReddit,ff3i9c3,t1_ff2qu5j,1579541610.0,"In the US, we don't have that.  It's up to the individual if they want to decide whether or not they want to make a retirements savings account and or money into it consistently. 

I know so many people throughout their 30-40's who still don't have anything saved for retirement.  Like, literally nothing.  When I ask them what they're going to do, they often say either ""oh, well I still have time to save up before I actually retire"" or ""I guess I'll just figure it out as I go.""

Those are the people who end up struggling under the tight amounts that the government gives them.  It really makes absolutely no sense why the US doesn't follow Australia's example here.  It's not like NO ONE knows what to do and we're all just clueless - it's just that the US is both too stubborn to 'admit defeat' and take after another country's example, and they're incredibly resistant to change, even if it's a good change."

makemychoice,ff2dups,t1_ff175sn,1579502105.0,"You're not too far from Greece...

It's kind of a bit difficult to say. 

On the one hand, you have Latin, which is essentially a dead language on it's own.  It does share a lot of root words with languages such as English, Spanish, French, and Italian - all of those options likely being more relevant in Europe.

Greek, on the other hand, has an entirely different character system, of which is used nowhere else in the world save for Greece.  The same can be said for the spoken language - only in Greece, unless there are a lot of Greeks in your corner of the world?

To be completely frank, I don't think either of them are really the best to be learning from a purely practical standpoint, unless you plan to eventually move to Greece.

But, at least by sticking with Latin, you'll continue to become knowledgeable of the roots of different romance languages, which would be nice if you ever plan to pick up and learn any of those languages later on.

TooAfraidToAsk,fetm2tr,t3_eqhhvo,1579376801.0,"I'll be completely honest here - if I walk into a restroom and it's completely empty I'll typically aim for the handicapped one.  I'm a very large person, and while I can still easily enough fit into regular stalls, it can often feel a bit uncomfortable and cramped.

I understand that wheelchair users can *only* use that stall, so if it's occupied then they'll have to wait.  Buy the chances of having a wheelchair user come in during the 2-3 minutes I need to shit is fairly unlikely.  In any case, they wouldn't have to wait very long.

I also realize, all too well, that many disabilities aren't something you can always see.  That being said, if you have IBS or something similar and need a toilet, *any* toilet is fine in that case.  It doesn't really necessarily need to be the handicapped one.  I can't see any real added benefit it would serve to that person.

Also, I definitely feel for those with arthritis or bad joints, etc. who really benefit from that hand rail, but I don't know if it's just where I live, but almost ALL bathroom stalls have a rail nowadays, regardless of whether they're specifically for handicapped people or not.

So while I'm not physically handicapped myself, I still prefer to use that stall if it's available to me.  I sincerely hope I don't upset or offend anyone who is handicapped by admitting this, but if I find that this is something people feel strongly about, I wouldn't mind changing my future actions."

Of course, the fact that a lot of us aren't properly educated in money management specifically is only compounded by the fact that many of us are, quite frankly, overworked and underpaid.  Getting through college has become the standard and a lot of employers expect to see a degree on your resume.  It's no longer just a nice perk.  And with the skyrocketing tuition rates and such a large majority of the younger population going into debt, quite honestly, our country is just a mess.

The best most of us can do is learn how to properly save and spend the money we do have, and that's still a rare skill.  I really hope that this post reaches at least a few people out there - that you need to constantly be prepared for these things, because nobody *plans* for their car to break down, yanno?

AskReddit,feowkxv,t1_feorunq,1579306960.0,"I'll admit that I'm quite lucky in this regard - If any type of emergency were to suddenly befall me, I'd certainly be able to take care of it.  My partner and I have been working and saving very, very diligently over the past 13 years, with the first 5-6 or so years spent living in borderline poverty.  Our friends called us cheap and stingy because we'd never eat out or buy fancy phones/electronics.  We were (and still are, haha) big time coupon ""clippers.""

In the long run we're doing well though.  We're still saving (though we're a bit more lenient when it comes to certain luxuries now), preparing ourselves for the future - be it travel, kids, buying a house, or retirement, so we can take those challenges on to the best of our ability when the time does come.

I think a lot of people are surprised when they find out how much we have stashed away in savings, particularly because we live a very modest middle class life.  That is to say, even though we technically *have* the money, we live like we *don't* have it for the most part.  I think going with that mindset has been one of the biggest helps for us.

I grew up in a poor town well below the poverty line, and know all about living paycheck to paycheck, worrying if there'll be food in the house, and watching my parents debating which utility to have shut off next.  I never had things like a car or a TV, and I think because of that upbringing (at least somewhat) I'm able to more properly appreciate ""the little things"" in life nowadays.

I still know so many people though who would be majorly set back if they had to cough up $700 out of the blue.  I know that when I was growing up, we never learned anything about financial management or other actual ""adulting"" real world things, and I really think that if we pushed for more of that in American schools we'd (hopefully) see those rates fall."
