ScientificNutrition,fgg6p3c,t1_fgg4mc9,1580755420.0,"Been waiting for this study since there's often some doubt as the real effects of red meat when processed red meat are lumped in with unprocessed. In this study processed meat is clearly bad for our health but unless I'm reading the numbers wrong, the HR for unprocessed red meat seems surprisingly low. Not even enough to worry about when other dietary factors are in order."

I don't want to follow each of those studies but I'd like to know if the real food performed better than the supplements, and I wonder if the foods would work equally as well if the bacteria was killed."

Beer (being made from plants) is loaded with antioxidants, fiber and tons of vitamins and minerals. It's anti-inflammatory, lowers your blood pressure, lowers bad cholesterol (LDL) while raising good cholesterol (HDL), and lowers your risk of T2D.

>Lowered corporate taxes to encourage growth. Cut bureaucratic red tape for businesses to grow and new ones to open, opened fracking to create 700,000 new jobs in the oil industry and make the U.S. nearly energy independent

I honestly can't tell if the person was trying to make Trump sound good or bad. It feels like some kind of meta-ironic post. Do they really think cutting corporate taxes was meant to encourage growth? Do they know ""cutting red tape"" is code for removing oversight and regulations that protect consumers? It's 2020. Who the hell is talking about fracking in a positive light?

I don't know where these people have been hiding for the past 30 years, but their opinions seem to have come out of nowhere. I don't feel like any significant segment of society has been pushing for lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations, and more environmental disasters. I think that's why Trump supporters get compared to neo nazis, because they both seem like a segment of society that's been underground for a while but suddenly came bursting out."

Man, I felt that statement. Taking adderall made it feel like I had cubby holes in my mind where I could put problems to be solved, and then tackle each problem one by one. It was nice having functional working memory. It was like this voice in my head that said, ""Hey, relax. You have plenty of time to work on this.""

I think some people look at drugs like adderall and think, ""Of course you're getting more done. It's speed!"" But I got more done because it relaxed me and I didn't get frustrated over every single minor impediment."

The team were a bunch of cliquey stiffs and I never felt welcome. They put in the least amount of effort possible to answer my questions.

You may have had the same problem at your previous job. It could have been the people causing your anxiety rather than the nature of the work. It may not have been anything that was outright obvious, like someone being a jerk. Some teams just aren't managed well and it creates an unsettling vibe."
