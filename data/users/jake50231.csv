LetsTalkMusic,fcwqmml,t3_ej2pks,1578033788.0,That’s a great list but you should probably have other sources of learning about music besides theneedledrop.

I swear to god as soon as any PC product is marketed to gamers it doubles in price and people eat it up."
dankmemes,fcs1dt9,t1_fcrt86s,1577909918.0,"A lot of gamers are extremely gullible and like flashy things way more than they are willing to admit. 

Like cmon the average gamer knows nothing about the real difference between what’s inside an i7 core and an i9 core they just know bigger number = more better = more frames."

shittyrobots,fci3wrl,t1_fcfa7rw,1577657472.0,I’m none of those things but I still love fucking around with arduinos. So cheap and so much versatility.
todayilearned,fci1v0m,t1_fcha47v,1577656739.0,"If you make a measly 5% on your investments on 20 mil (not hard at all to do. When you have that kind of money it’s easy to get it managed well) you will make a million dollars a year passively. That’s far more than enough for any reasonable person to live on, and get anything you could ever want. As soon as you sell that invention for that kind of money you have peace of mind for the rest of your life. I can’t imagine not taking that offer."

I think I’ve literally seen this exact thing on several parody pages."

OutOfTheLoop,fcafj2j,t1_fc6v4vz,1577568358.0,He never shit on other women. He just said he’s glad his wife doesn’t do that. If I say I’m glad my girlfriend plays video games with me does that mean I’m shitting on girls that don’t play video games?
Unexpected,fca9tfc,t1_fc8jq3w,1577565307.0,"Jesus fucking Christ our education system needs to be fixed if this is really the case. 

Actually never mind.  It’s much more important we memorize hundreds of dates in history class rather than actually learning about historical events and why they were important."
OutOfTheLoop,fc9crpu,t1_fc4g4s1,1577550641.0,I just wish the criticism was actually focused on her being a shitty person and not on her appearance. Also wish that people would call out male rappers as much as Cardi B for their bad behavior.
OutOfTheLoop,fc9c9by,t1_fc6uyy2,1577550431.0,"She doesn’t owe me anything but I still have my preferences. That doesn’t mean she has to look like that. She can wear any amount of makeup and I’d still love her. She prefers when I dress up that doesn’t mean I owe it to her to dress up every day. She also prefers me clean shaven over a beard. I’ll stay clean shaven because it makes her happy but I don’t owe her that. I honestly wonder if you’ve ever even been in a relationship because if you have you’d likely know that the dirty little secret is we’re all shallow and we all have preferences. I also never claimed I was giving a rebellious attitude. I was just giving an alternative viewpoint than the one everyone else was giving. Honestly I have no idea where you got any of that from. 

Also I’m sorry but you’re not gonna convince me that I got downvoted because people found that sexist, and that I was reducing women to nothing except their attractiveness on a thread that is literally focused on calling Cardi B a hideous zombie when she’s not wearing makeup. That was not even one of the more sexist comments in this thread, most of which are being upvoted.

Did you strain yourself reaching for all those conclusions?"
OutOfTheLoop,fc6j85b,t1_fc6gsof,1577481875.0,"Honestly I’ve been downvoted any time I bring up a story involving my girlfriend. 


I can’t for the life of me figure out any reason why that would be?"
OutOfTheLoop,fc6f0ml,t1_fc4u3nd,1577479021.0,Man why are people so angry at us for being happy with the people we’re with?
OutOfTheLoop,fc6eyac,t1_fc55nxn,1577478976.0,No just putting in a personal anecdote to add to the conversation. I didn’t know redditors would get so pissed at me for having a girlfriend. Apparently it’s triggering to people here.
OutOfTheLoop,fc4tcym,t1_fc4n29m,1577427664.0,"My girlfriend rarely wears makeup and to me she looks flawless 24/7. She does do some minimalist makeup every now and then which maybe makes her look slightly better, but I prefer no makeup to the very few times I’ve seen her in heavy makeup.

Man this really upset people apparently."

todayilearned,fc3bljf,t1_fc2oder,1577386185.0,Theology is interesting to me because it’s the only academic field where the less logically consistent an idea is the more weight it holds.
