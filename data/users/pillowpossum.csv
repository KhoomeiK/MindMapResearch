unpopularopinion,fgsyyb9,t1_fgsxtt3,1581095565.0,But your whole post seemed to be more about how women can't be both sexual and taken seriously in the same breath??

unpopularopinion,fgsvt91,t1_fgsua2b,1581093697.0,So if a woman is a doctor she can't go out and be dressed sexy when she's off work?
unpopularopinion,fgsrwiq,t3_f04e9c,1581091355.0,"You could always just be respectful of all people's choices. 

You can be sexual and still want to be treated with respect, you can be a professional and still be sexual outside of a professional setting. 

You actually can have it both ways."

unpopularopinion,ffuu672,t1_ffutw1q,1580249399.0,I think that's an age/maturity issue that isn't exclusive to women. I think if you had conversations w women friends about this you'd be surprised. Lumping us all this way is pretty uncool.
unpopularopinion,ffusg1u,t1_ffus455,1580248489.0,"I think sometimes women go into a relationship w a person that seems nice, and they end up being shitty, but by that point you may be emotionally attached. I feel like this can be said for anyone, you start something good, and when it goes bad it's hard to just leave. We aren't looking for people to treat us badly."
unpopularopinion,ffursos,t1_ffur6bk,1580248132.0,"I thought this was going based off of the stereotype ""women want a guy that treats them like shit"" ""women go after men that are pieces of shit"" 

The study you linked seems to point out that women think these men are good, or don't realize they are violent/psychopathic"
unpopularopinion,ffur29k,t1_ffupouk,1580247708.0,"Yeah this is about a psychopath's charm and ability to manipulate people very easily. “Psychopathic men have a personality style that makes them appear attractive to women in dating encounters. This may be because they are extra confident or feel at ease or know exactly what to say to get the attention of women."" 

Not really due to women liking ""bad boys"""
