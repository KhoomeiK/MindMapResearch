AskReddit,ffk5yxu,t3_ett7fr,1580016967.0,"Staying with people who bullied me/ disrespected me long ago. This happened to me in middle school. When I complained to my parents, they told me people of this age maybe like this and will get better later on. I had a few amazing friends who understood me and helped me at tough times, they still do.

But what I didn’t realize was if they’re capable of doing once, they’ll do it again. Yes, I was bullied and disrespected by them again in my early twenties - after 10-12 long years. I ditched them. Yes life is far better. 

I have those amazing people who supported me no matter what and never made me feel low. It’s a privilege to only be surrounded by people like them."

You are a wise and strong person and certainly you deserve better. I know it is tough, but once the initial phase is over, you will realize it’s the best thing that has ever happened to you. Please try again for this stranger’s sake."
