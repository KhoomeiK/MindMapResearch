A LOT OF SUICIDAL PEOPLE DO HAVE PEOPLE WHO LOVE AND WOULD MISS THEM- THEY JUST CANT SEE IT.

If it's someone who knows you, theres nothing wrong with pointing it out. Regardless, someone saying that to **me** was never an issue because it's all subjective."

NarcissisticAbuse,fdsppih,t1_fdsmrt9,1578706340.0,"True. that would be an interesting thing to **entertain**, but yes it's all subjective. I suppose it's from the standpoint that she was allowed to run lose and do hard drugs by her parents at a young age compared to him growing up fairly well off yet becoming such a manipulative person. It could possibly even be a nature vs nurture type of issue, as sociopaths and psychopaths (disputed as they may be) are kind of the same comparison as well. Or maybe I'm biased?"

offmychest,fds3em9,t3_emxxny,1578693723.0,I mean.. Being an introvert often comes hand in hand with being socially inept- therefore turning into the want to be alone. Just because you don't have social anxiety/awkwardness doesn't change the fact that people who DO have it are often introverts. What even is the POINT of bringing down people who have social ineptitudes?
