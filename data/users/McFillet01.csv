depression,ff52sqi,t3_ermt16,1579578674.0,"I know how that feels. I was reaching a breaking point with keeping all my feelings inside, and how it felt like my insides were being torn apart by myself every day. One day, I was talking to a work friend. And I guess because I subcociously felt like I had to vent, I straight up handed him my journal for him to read. After reading it, I felt like 'oh shit o shit oh shit o shit' like I had destroyed my life or betrayed myself or something, but after a few days, he just continued to treat me the same, and I realised the consequences to opening up were only in my head, and that made me feel that I had some power over myself."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fdy74fq,t1_fdxzbm4,1578776795.0,"Very true, but if you look at theory and technical skill. Np was much more consistently inventive, where I find nick Mason was too stripped down in his approach to be eligible for goat status. And as a drummer myself, I understand there is a time and a place for falling into the background, but even if you just look at a song like Tom Sawyer, np was doing so many things that no one else was doing. His flow is honestly pretty timeless. Even though art is subjective, not all art is created equal."
