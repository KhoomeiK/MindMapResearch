That being said, i bought some Walmart brand chicken breasts for chicken cacciatore. It's a very simple recipe, and with a slow cooker, is virtually impossible for meat to come out bad.

The chicken breasts from Walmart came out dreadful. Rubbery, tasteless, and bland. In *chicken cacciatore*.

This is because the poultry from Walmart is *Young*. It doesn't cook right, doesn't hold the flavor at all. It's fine if you don't care what you're eating or you cannot afford a better quality product. I don't hate on people who can't afford anything else because I'm not that guy. I *am* a guy who enjoys cooking and feeding his friends, though, so no, i won't be buying from Walmart.

Chicken breasts from Safeway taste much, much better and is of a much higher quality. It's more expensive, but living is expensive these days, but you get what you pay for, and cheap food has ultimately been proven to be less healthy for you.

You can be as salty as you fucking want, friend, about how i feel about Walmart, but a quick Google of complaints about Walmart protein being absolute ass shows that many, many, MANY people feel the same.

Rape is a different kind of violence altogether. It is longer lasting, has untold consequences, and i highly doubt there would ever be a way to 'cartoon up' rape like you can with murder.

It's why you can have a pg-13/14 movies where the heroes are murdering the hell out of their enemies: they are either robots, CGI aliens or something other. Cartoon violence, you see??

gaming,fehvwco,t3_ep8jjl,1579124916.0,"one of the primary things you need to consider is amount of YOUR game time vs theirs, especially in games like PubG and R6, where your main enemy is another person. i don't have a lot of time to play (about an hour a day, a little more on the weekends), but some people have considerably more. they have *time* to pick up skills whereas i *do not,* at least not in any measurable time frame. 

this makes the game less fun for me, especially if all i'm doing is dying. so i play single player games, or if i do play something online, it's either in a coop format or a PvE server.   


it took me a long time to come to accept this fact. so, either you spend more time in a single sitting playing games like PubG and R6 and working on your skills, or you step back and look at what other games are out there that fit into your requirements for a good game. you can get good at games, it just depends on a lot of different factors (age, response time, etc). don't beat yourself up over it, though, because they really just are games. they're supposed to be entertaining, and if they're not, something is wrong."
