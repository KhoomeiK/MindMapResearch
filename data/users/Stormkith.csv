The second type are incredibly skilled players who know how to play a rogue character that works with his party and on their behalf rather than only for himself. This type is far less common, but also far more useful.

Players of the first type are an absolute bane, and the moment you see a player trying to steal anything that isn't nailed down, address it. Either they stop acting like a dickhead or they leave. It's that simple. (Odds are, you're going to have to kick them, so I won't hold it against you if you just go ahead and do that rather than try to talk sense into them.)"

I achieved that effect by using the Waystone Green as a ""base"" and then adding a layer of the blue over the top, transitioning up to where I didn't base it in the green first. It was incredibly simple and I was really happy with how it looked out the gate.
