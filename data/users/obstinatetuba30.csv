They could've gone with the fact that she didn't actually pay a Hitman, she only paid a police officer and if they are charging her of attempted murder they should charge the policeman too of being a Hitman. They went with reality show wtf like, any defense makes more sense than what they did lmaoo"

Edit 1: just checked the definition of term half past, half past something means half an hour after that time, so half past half past 8 would be 9."
