Biologically?  Yes it does.  If an animal is going to have only one partner its entire life, it needs to stick around to reproduce for more than a single cycle.  Afaik there isn't a single mammal that mates for only a single cycle.  Gibbons are a great example of an actually monogamous creature.  They're primates that, when they mate, will never take another mate.  They stick together in a bonded pair and even after the other is dead will never seek another mate.  No great ape is monogamous.  Not a single one.  Not gorillas, not bonobos, not orangutans, and certainly not humans.  We date, posture, masturbate, challenge, display, and even form natural harems.  It's simple biology.  Longer sex times actually point the opposite direction.  If a creature is bonded with its exact and exclusive mate then there's no need for an elaborate sex ritual.  There's no competition.  The need to court and express a long sexual ritual is actually indicative of greater competition for mates that comes with non-exclusive pairings."

Not even close.  Exclusive marriage came about to simplify property law.  It's not our biological default.  You know how you can tell?  Sexual dimorphism.  Animals that mate with only one partner for life look identical male to female.  Gibbons and many birds are great examples of this.  Great apes, like humans and gorillas have a lot of differences between the sexes because it's on the male to attract as many mates as he possibly can."
