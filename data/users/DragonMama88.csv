Dad is the oldest male on his side of the family with the exception of 1 uncle who just turned 98. I've found myself trying to get more experiences in with him. I usually buy him concert tickets, or hockey tickets, etc. Quality over quantity!

raisedbynarcissists,ff4zm4n,t1_ff4s5r4,1579576300.0,It amazes me that they're siblings. My 4 uncles are all amazing. One of my aunts on that side is too. The other aunt is a younger version of my nmom.
raisedbynarcissists,ff3o6z3,t3_erh4d9,1579545257.0,"When I was 15, one of my cousins was getting married. My nmom tried to convince me to wear a white blouse to the wedding. I called my aunt (cousin's mom) and asked if that was even appropriate. Oh man was she mad that I went above her judgement. My nmom wouldn't dare wear white herself, but jumped at the opportunity to try to get me to. The next 2 weddings in the family, 2 of my uncles, they made sure I was in the bridal party so she couldn't try to force me into white again."

raisedbynarcissists,fdk4uau,t3_elkgdt,1578496082.0,"All the freaking time. In high school, I ran 2 after school clubs and was in 6 different music groups. Cell phones were a thing, but my parents refused to get me one (which is fair enough) I'd call home from the pay phone in the school lobby and whenever it asked for a name for the recording ""you have a collect call from YourForgottenDaughter do you accept charges?"" Then I'd wait an extra half hour for my stay at home mom to get off her ass. I lived 5 miles from the school. If I walked I'd have to cross 6 lanes of highway traffic. 

When I started working, my first move was to figure out if I had coworkers who lived close by to try to carpool, as my parents made zero effort in teaching me how to drive and relying on them for rides cost me a few jobs. 

Now I'm typically 15 minutes early to anything I have to do. My poor husband doesn't understand why I get so stressed out when we have appointments."
