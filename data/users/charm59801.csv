depression,ff59qq9,t1_ff57kkm,1579584520.0,"I'm sorry, if you can figure out what triggered it that might help. Sometimes figuring out the trigger can help you redirect your thoughts and actions to solve the problem. Of course part of it might be chemical but the life aspect of it might be easier to solve. Maybe you're feeling some burnout from work and its translating to your home life. Also for me it's just a matter of time sometimes so I do just indulge my depressive desires until I feel better."

But I gained it all back lol and now I'm like blegh I wish i could lose it again but i have no motivation. 

It sucks too cause all the things that would make me feel better i dont have the motivation to do. Clean house = happy mind, excersice = happy mind, skinny body = positive self image. Fo I wanna do any of those things? Noooooooo"
depression,ff56ig8,t1_ff51qnw,1579581632.0,"It's the biggest way my depression manifests itself. I get real self deprecating thoughts and no motivation.

I dont even know what her problem is. She apologizes everytime and has some sort of excuse and I get pissed off and then forgive her. But like we made plans on thrusday she said she wanted to take a nap first. Then just NEVER MESSAGED ME BACK until friday morning. Then I was like it's cool I get it let's hang today?

depression,ff4q7oy,t3_erj6dh,1579569809.0,"Me and my boyfriend both suffer from some depression and it has been tough sometimes to keep it in check. For me what I find hard is my boyfriend just shuts down. He doesnt want to talk about it. At some points hes gotten super down and to this day o dont know what he was thinking. Pushing him to talk about it was never the answer because it didnt help him it only helped me. At one point I literally asked him how do I help you? He told me he doesnt like to talk at all sometimes and just the company and distraction helps. But sometimes being alone does help. I try really hard not to project what I need on to him. I need to talk and over explain this is the opposite of helpful for him. 

If you want to stick it out realize this might be a forever thing, and you might have to lean on him less than other people. Hopefully he has his moments where you can lean on him too."

Pwrsoany only things I miss from sims 3 is owning part of businessif you click on a business it's an option dont remember exactly what it's called though) and I miss the rabbit holes there was a theater and museum and restaurants you could go to and your sims would disappear and you could have them woohoo in the theater for a fun moodlet lol. Also cops and firefighters were awesome because they'd actually come help.

Love getting downvoted for my opinion."

CasualConversation,fem0tow,t1_fem08fe,1579236114.0,Same! I've always wanted to make a lot of money. Being a poor kid it's always been a goal. But even more my selfish goal I want to provide for my future family and my wonderful boyfriend. I cant wait to see us both thriving together. Like it's all I want in life is to be a happy healthy financially stable family.
CasualConversation,felzvqv,t3_epv18r,1579235323.0,"I'm 23 and want kids probably in the next 10 years? Im with a long term partner who would make a fantastic father and an amazing co-parent. I joke a lot about never wanting kids but deep down I really do want a family. I'm just so not ready yet. 

I haven't even been my own person really yet. I want to get into better physical shape first too. I'm fat, always have been. I was a fat kid. I think childhood obesity is the biggest contributor to my adult fatness. I dont want to do that to my kid. I want to teach them and show them how to be active. I also really want to be better off financially. 

Me and my partner both grew up pretty fricken poor and it sucked as kids and now growing up. I just do not want to do that to my future kids. Also I just want to be able to provide in a way I wasnt provided for. 

I also want to travel and live without kids first. I'm literally just about to graduate college so my life is just about to start. I dont want to have a kid rn. 

Also on the total flip side though I'm so fuckin impatient for that family feeling, and like I said my partner would be an amazing father and I cant wait to see him in that role. I do get pretty strong baby fever but i know realistically I'm not where i want to be yet."
TwoXChromosomes,felrxiu,t1_felr7t7,1579229443.0,Then why are you even in this thread.
TwoXChromosomes,felrj4a,t1_fel9q6n,1579229173.0,You realize it happens right? Like often? Parents kill their kids because they dont want them and by simply neglecting them. Ans if they dont kill them they severely traumatize them. I know plenty of kids who wish they were never born. Maybe it's why our suicide rate is so fucking high.
TwoXChromosomes,felrfud,t1_felaf3u,1579229112.0,Killing a toddler and aborting a literal clump of cells is not the same. Wtf.

TwoXChromosomes,fek4otw,t1_fejwnty,1579192544.0,No one is saying some women dont. But when pro lifers want to tell women that they will definitely regret this shows they're wrong. It might be useful information for someone to read and feel validated.

TwoXChromosomes,fej4sha,t1_fej42rk,1579156905.0,Honesty would be cool if women weren't shamed for their reasons.  Pregnancy and birth shouldn't be punishment for having sex. Did you know some antibiotics can make birth control fail.  Should those women be forced to carry a baby they don't want?
TwoXChromosomes,fej4l5v,t1_fej40ev,1579156679.0,"Which is why it's a personal decision to terminate based on ones personal beliefs. I dont think there is a scientific answer, at least not yet.

TwoXChromosomes,fej21ne,t1_fej13sj,1579154028.0,"Abortion isn't the wrong thing, and adoption isn't the right thing. It's a decision to make either way but neither one is right or wrong. It depends on the situation. Pregnancy is trauma on the body, mind and life. Making someone go through that could put their lives at risk. That thing inside women doesnt have more rights than the woman carrying it. Not being financially, emotionally or any other type of ready is a valid reason to have an abortion. 

Are you still pro choice or did this revelation make you decide we should outlaw abortions?"
TwoXChromosomes,fej1o10,t1_fej0vwx,1579153667.0,"They werent babies they were fetuses, or embryos."

TwoXChromosomes,feizb2y,t1_feiyy06,1579151487.0,I think that's up to interpretation. Personally I'd say somewhere in the second trimester when it could easily live on it's own with out the mother. But even then it isnt my choice when someone else can terminate their pregnancy. We can't force someone to use their body as an incubator.
TwoXChromosomes,feiz0os,t1_feiyq9d,1579151235.0,"Of course, I appreciate you said your opinion shouldn't be confused with fact. Just because we agree doesnt mean it's true. That's important to remember. I'd like to see more psychological effects of abortion being studied."

TwoXChromosomes,feiy3wo,t1_feiwvbe,1579150447.0,It's fair to be skeptical. I think it still shows a valid pattern. 667 isn't a terribly small sample size though. I agree the women knowing they will be called and having to talk about it could confound some of the outcome. I'd be curious to see what precautions they took. Or if they feel they shouldve added more.
TwoXChromosomes,feiwpv9,t1_feiwe8w,1579149299.0,I thought so too! People often talk about how it was the hardest decision to ever make. But I think it's okay if it wasnt a tough decision. You don't have to feel guilty or regretful just to make it an okay choice.
TwoXChromosomes,feiwhtv,t1_feitch6,1579149119.0,Yeah that's a fair distinction.
TwoXChromosomes,feiwe6h,t1_feiuneb,1579149037.0,Yeah when the choice is taken away its normal to feel different feelings than when you make that choice for yourself.
TwoXChromosomes,feiw7qb,t1_feirw35,1579148893.0,Well good thing fetuses and embryos arent people.
TwoXChromosomes,feirclw,t1_feiqp5t,1579145267.0,I love all these comparisons to criminals. Really shows some peoples true colors.
