Memes aside, people are laughing and making memes about someone who's sick in the head. Is he an asshole? Probably. Is he sick? Definitely. 

The guy deserves better from his fans, from the NFL, and from the sports community. He needs to be pushed to do the right thing and seek professional help, rather than being laughed at and ignored."
