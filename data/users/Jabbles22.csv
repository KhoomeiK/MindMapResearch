I can accept stickers, hats t-shirts, etc but I just don't get the love people have for him or any politician to the point of wrapping your car and getting a personalized license plate. Closest thing I had was a Jean Chretien (Former Canadian Prime Minister) poster I had in my room. I didn't particular like him but I found the poster when helping a teacher clean out a storage space.  I kind of thought it would be funny to have it."
IdiotsInCars,ffx605j,t1_ffx4vd5,1580318478.0,"That is why I said I don't agree with them. It's just not as simple as ""I am only risking myself"". There are similar arguments for motorcycle helmets. Let's say you mess up and hit a guy on a motorcycle. If wearing a helmet you still injured him but he survives. Now if he wasn't wearing a helmet he may have a serious head injury or he may even die. Now the accident was your fault but the severity of injuries was due to a lack of helmet."

askTO,ffwz9g3,t3_evojkw,1580314348.0,"Legally I simply don't know what is and isn't a legit reason to evict someone. Realistically though that is a risk you take when renting a house. The owner may want to sell or simply move in.

Before talking to them find out what you can and cannot legally do. Once you know what is legal then you can choose how to proceed. You could simply ask them to move, if they are ok with that then is should be easy but get things written down. If they do not want to move then it's up to you if you want to push for legal eviction (assuming you can), if you force them out and aren't in a hurry you can likely give them plenty of warning. It's not like you are planning on kicking them out with only a few days notice and it sounds like they are doing OK financially so they should have no problem finding a new place to live. 

&#x200B;

Kicking someone out for not paying rent is necessary but can result in those people being homeless,that sucks, these people may not be happy to be forced out but I am sure they will be fine, especially if they always paid rent on time. If you can vouch for them not being deadbeats that will help them find a new place.

Lastly it's ultimately your parents decision since they own the place but if you really don't feel comfortable having people kicked out on your behalf let your parents know."

What I really don't get is why they refuse to use it even if it isn't required.

I walk into the house and am blasted by warm air, it is hotter in that house than I would ever set my thermostat.
