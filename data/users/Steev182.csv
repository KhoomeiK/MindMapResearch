teslamotors,ffbsx7s,t1_ffasgfn,1579781555.0,"I think you’re being downvoted because it’s a bit of a blanket disagreement. But I think the weather and how a city/state maintains their infrastructure play a big part in how a car survives over the years. Two reasons I don’t have my Mustang anymore:  

Space as we only have one car with 2 kids under 4.  
The punishment that a sportier car goes through in the winter and on the roads ravaged by winter.  

As long as a car is so low and doesn’t have much suspension travel, the roads in winter are just a really harsh environment. I had replaced the tie rods, hand brake because the cable snapped from erosion, a tyre blew out from a horrible pothole, the front splitter was torn off when I drove during a snowfall from work and the snow hid a big chunk of solid ice. Then by the time I did sell it, it needed a new transmission mount, new control arms, new shocks. Most 120,000 miles in NYC/LI. 

The Pathfinder I have now is pretty good. The steering and suspension components have done well because they have some more travel and a higher ride height. The underbody panels have survived too.  

As for hail, that’s something that can affect all cars. Not sure why that would be a reason to get rid of it, and it’d be just as bad for any other car in the same price range.  

Maybe the Y would share some of the qualities my Pathfinder has so it can survive the roads better and doesn’t have air suspension which I’d guess would be pricey to replace if/when a shock blows out."

So I recently bought an a7iii. The low light performance is great. I bought a 50mm to go with it as a mount lenses aren't compatible with the E mount Sonys, and I really like it.  

My stance on not buying such an expensive camera if I'm not making money with it kind of changed a little. Whilst I'd like to make money using it, I found myself using my bloody iPhone in low light conditions more than my G85 because anything over ISO 1600 on it would need to be made B&W to get any recovery from the noise I had.

When driving normally, we don't stick our hazards on willy nilly. If we're using proper lane discipline, we don't have to put on hazards to let cars behind us know we're there so they can pass us like someone above mentioned, too.  

The best times for this is when the Tesla is decelerating or is stationary and detects a vehicle closing in at a fast rate. Another time is when it is decelerating quickly on a highway. In Europe, you *should* activate your hazards when braking hard on a highway, but some people need to deal with the hard braking before they can activate them. This would be a great feature to enable automatically, and is easily done.

1. It isn't like looking at a real image. It is looking at the real world, not a representation of how the photo will look. It may save some battery life, but back when I had my a330, I dropped it and the mirror went out of alignment. It meant that the framing was off as well as not being an accurate representation of the images captured. This meant I'd have to frame the shot to the right slightly in order to frame what I wanted to fill the frame properly. That's just a balls up of mine, but hopefully shows it isn't a true representation. Another thing I prefer with EVFs is that so much more information can be there for you and can be tuned somewhat.
2. Guess what else has loads of buttons and dials that you can use blind? The a7iii.
3. The menu on the a7iii kinda sucks, but is nowhere as bad as people say. The only custom menu item I have is to switch to crop mode, as I only have a 50mm lens, and it's nice to have it zoom in a bit. I loved the articulating screen on the G85 - still do to be fair, but I haven't found it anywhere near as necessary on the a7iii as I did on the G85.
4. The lens choices on FE are a lot better than when I went away from my a55, and partially why I went m43. Plus adapted vintage MF lenses perform much better on mirrorless than DSLR because of things like focus peaking and zoom assist."
