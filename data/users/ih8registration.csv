NoStupidQuestions,ff8mnfs,t1_ff8lno7,1579686129.0,"Yes It's this sort of, but in general once something is standardised it cannot guarantee to keep up with another standard (they do evolve after all) so it's much easier to worry about one set of problems, and more importantly they are the problems you made and can fix.

If you want to support a competing standard there will be a lot of wasted time and money depending on how the standard gets updated in the future.
It might be trivial for your opposition to make you look foolish.

It's quite a gamble."

ProRevenge,ff4jxf7,t1_ff49ei7,1579565411.0,"Actually that's why Karen's like this get to manage a place like this.
The people they are helping are vulnerable to manipulation and there's lots of volunteers around who do not follow or understand professional conduct.

I have volunteered a bit over the past 20 years for Red Cross, Salvation Army and lately an Anglican church kitchen for homeless people.

I ended up leaving the kitchen because the one person there that was getting paid seemed to schedule things together that would create conflict.
When I would offer solutions on how to get the volunteers working together better I was told that 'we are a community development program and people won't develop if we only keep them in their safe space'

So basicly find out what the volunteers are good at and then DON'T let them do that task.
Then you can justify your position to the higher ups and point to all the new things people are learning.

2 examples here for you:
So the one guy that is patient enough to cook pasta correctly gets assigned to the front area so as to run food out to tables.
Now I'm now throwing away huge amounts of sludgy (precooked yesterday) pasta and trying to get something quickly cooked that isn't mushy crap. I know it's for homeless people but... how hard is to cook pasta?

The girl with high functioning autism and crippling anxiety gets put on the front counter to deal with the general public.
She follows rules to the letter and was trying to get her own catering business up and running. She would have been perfect in the kitchen and would have learnt a lot about prep-times and food safety. And I'm sure she would wait for the water to boil before adding pasta :)

Buuuuuut those are skills she was looking to develop herself, so much better to throw her in the deep end and take her out of her comfort zone. Right? /s

There are more detailed examples but I think you get the point.

So in a nutshell:

Under cooked sludgy pasta (water usually wasn't boiling when pasta was put in and everyone was too busy talking and patting each other on the back to care about quality)

Food not prepared on time (previous day) so menu is incomplete.

People going for a break from kitchen and sitting outside chain smoking talking to the other volunteers, sometimes never coming back... just stay outside and talk about how great it feels to help.

Volunteers hanging out in the kitchen looking for free food when I'm trying to clean everything and leave. Not offering to help just in the way.

Sheesh what a clusterfuck I'm over volunteering I swear it's the blind leading the blind.
I understand that the situation is non-standard but cmon a good manager works with the strengths of their team not the direct opposite.

Take care"
