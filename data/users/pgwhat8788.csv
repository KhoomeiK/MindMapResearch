EZ way to save that builds up and makes you feel good about yourself - save $100 a month if you can and don’t touch it. It builds up and you won’t want to spend it once it grows to like $300

My way based off fixed income 
1. Take the total check amount and immediately subtract rent/college/bills
2. Take that new total and divide it by 2.
3. Put half of that into your “I can’t spend this” jar
4. Take the other half and divide it by 30 (days till next paycheck)
5. 4 is your daily expenditure. If you go under that then the average daily expenditure goes up! If you go over you’ll have to be tighter for the next couple days."
