She never went public with it or to the family, but she moved out of state to get away from the family. She only told me and her boyfriend, who also threatened to kill him after he learned it.

In any case, I hope your family finally realized the truth and supports you, because that kind of personal invasion is just abhorrent, especially coming from your family, someone you thought you could trust. These things are incredibly painful and put tremendous stress on family dynamics.

I'd like to say I hope he learns his lesson, but honestly people who do this sort of thing aren't generally the kind of people to be remorseful for the actions they inflict upon others.
