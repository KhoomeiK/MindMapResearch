They were really able to pull your wisdom teeth in 15 minutes for the whole procedure though? That seems really short to me - they took 10 minutes to get me prepared before they even started the sedation when I had mine pulled, and to be honest I don't remember how long it took me to get out of there, but it was definitely not under half an hour."

30 minutes is typically if they don't do X-rays. I'll go in, sit down, and the assistant they poke around and examine a bit, go over previous results to compare, do some scraping of the hard-to-reach places, then floss, then brush and rinse. Then the doctor comes in and goes over results, maybe looks around himself, says it all looks good and you're good to go. 

Start to finish that about half an hour. With X-rays that adds 10-15 minutes depending on whether they're doing the wing bite things only or if they're doing a full set."

It can take minutes for the numbing agent to function, and hardening the crown takes 60 seconds by itself, but is done in multiple stages so that's multiple rounds of 60 seconds (might be faster now, but still). That's filled with precision drilling and removal of the root in multiple stages with multiple tools. If your dentist that all that in 10 minutes either you were fully sedated and don't remember or they didn't actually do anything.

Not to mention wisdom tooth removal. Did they just take some pliers to the back of your mouth and pull really hard?"

Source? Because I'm from the US and full sedation dentistry is a specialty area of a few dentists and pretty limited unless you're having major procedure done (like getting your wisdom teeth pulled). It happens, but it's usually just people who are afraid of it. The majority of Americans don't, by far.

>it's almost impossible to get adult people to sit still in a chair for fifteen minutes.

Also, where are you from that dental appointments take 15 minutes? What do they do there, look in your mouth for a minute, take the fast X-rays, and give you a thumbs up and a pat on the back while you're ushered out? The standard in the US is to get a cleaning when you go in, whether you really ""need"" it or not. That takes 30-45 minutes typically."

What does ""so it's probably 6 that gun laws don't change things and the US isn't any worse of 3 per capita than anywhere else"" mean? How does it fit between ""The both best and worst thing about this thread are the same people who will say this is a mass shooting in Germany"" and ""will also say these types of shootings don't count as mass shootings in the US and that's why there's only like 20 last year.""?

Either way, responding to at least the first and last part of your post, the if the definition of a mass shooting is 4 or more killed, or 3 or more killed, then this is a mass shooting *and* there are <20 (estimate, don't have the exact numbers in front of me) mass shootings per year in the US.

It's when we start using the definitions created by gun control groups that things get sticky, especially because the US is the only country that thinks about counting events with only injuries towards these numbers. Is someone shooting themselves in the parking lot of an abandoned school building in the middle of the night a school shooting? Is a kid hitting four people with a BB gun a mass shooting? When someone breaks their toe running away from a targeted murder, and that increases casualty count above 4 people, is that a mass shooting?

It's telling when someone wants to change an existing definition of something to make numbers more or less exclusive so that their side looks better."

PoliticalHumor,ff953hg,t1_ff6ki9x,1579705048.0,"You're right, but not in the way you think you are. 

If you talk to gun owners that vast majority will tell you that more people, minorities especially, owning firearms is a great thing. Firearms trainers and stores often hold discounted or free classes for LGBT or women or minority people to support their desire to defend themselves. Yeah, there are racists out there, but most gun owners want people to be able to protect themselves and to do so without ridiculous restrictions.

Where you're right, however, is in gun control being a fundamentally racist and classist endeavor in the US. All of these restrictions never seem to hurt the upstanding, wealthy, white man, or the police, or the government in general. If I have some money and time I would still be able to get most any firearm I wanted, I would still be able to find a range, I would still be able to take time off and go get training and pay someone to teach me or certify me, and I would still be able to pay any tax stamps required of me.

On then other hand, if I were struggling, or working two jobs, or someone that the people granting certifications didn't like, good luck to me! You know who most of those people are? Minorities and the lower class.

This is intentional. Reagan did it, the KKK tried it, and now Governor Blackface is trying it too. It's no different than enacting a poll tax or requiring a test to be able to vote, or the current practice of requiring someone to just magically have time available to go to the polls on a specific day. 

It's never the rich white people who have to worry about these things, it's always the poor and undesirables. Your party pushing it instead of the other party doesn't change that."
PoliticalHumor,ff93isb,t1_ff7ggba,1579703959.0,"I'm replying similarly as I did to another responder because these suggestions that this was a white nationalist rally and that all gun owners are old white racist bastards are ridiculous. 

Here are some more photos from the event for you: https://m.imgur.com/a/sQpVkpC

Overwhelming the evidence from this rally is that it was a peaceful and inclusive gathering of people who wanted to protest the government's decision to take away or limit their constitutional rights, and yet no matter how much that becomes evident (and has been evident from the start, despite what the media would like you to believe) some people are trying to force this white supremacist narrative that doesn't exist here. And then when evidence is posted it's downvoted and dismissed out of hand?

This mentality is nuts. The whole point of this rally is that gun rights are human rights, whatever race or creed or gender or religion you come from. And after all of that is said and done and proven and no one can point to any violence or discrimination at the event and *the protesters even clean up after themselves* you folks decide it's cool to just make fun of people supporting something they believe in because they're overweight. 

Like, what the fuck? How is this ok?

You go to all these lengths to try and find something you can point at to justify your beliefs that this was a white nationalist rally despite all the evidence otherwise, and the best you can come up with is ""racism isn't *racism* and clearly nuance isn't understood by the right."" Anything to justify your pre-existing beliefs, huh?"

You're right, a most of the people there were white males. Saying that makes it a racist event or a white nationalist rally is insanely disingenuous though. A few idiots being arrested before the event and the media making a storm about it being violent and how people are going to die (didn't happen, to no one who actually paid attention's surprise) doesn't make this a Nazi rally any more than [some people taking the opportunity to loot and burn stores](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/looting-erupts-after-vigil-slain-missouri-teen-michael-brown-n177426) at BLM protests make all the people there criminals and looters.

The thing is, you may not be *saying* people are racist, but the implication is sure as shit there. If it weren't you wouldn't be okay with people making fun of a guy at a political rally for something he believes in either, and you wouldn't be joking about *shooting minorities with a firearm.*"

MawInstallation,fef8ucg,t1_fef823v,1579050913.0,"I think it works for a geopolitical RP, Geosim specifically from what I can tell, because the posts play out like news reports on actual events - a Big Thing happens, the nations make their comments or take some action, and the world moves on. I wasn't able to find an actual war played out there, but I'd guess ends up playing out similarly. 

In-depth character RP I feel would be more difficult to pull off because you would be writing out whole conversations, back-and-forth actions, and so on between one or multiple people. Reddit isn't conducive to that on a community-wide scale. The Reddit mentality isn't really in that same space anyway, where a post can be made and then a week later someone can respond. If your thread isn't ""complete"" in a couple of days it sort of just disappears.

I was able to find the old Jedi Vs Sith forums - they seem long since dead, but there were sections for different sectors and planets and factions had their own forums and so on. Threads stayed up for days and when someone posted to one it would get bumped back up to the top so people could see a reply. That, or something similar and in my mind anyway, is more conducive to character based RPing."
MawInstallation,fef76vj,t3_eoqdgy,1579049799.0,"Back in the days of InvisionFree forums there were always Star Wars RPGs around. I've fallen out of that sort of thing as my time has gotten more limited (like you said, middle school me had the time to sit down and write out thousand word posts explaining how my character dropped his lightsaber from one hand and caught it in the other then tried to stab the other guy's character in the chest, and do it multiple times per day, while adult me does not), but I would imagine that you could find those things even today.

Hell, Facebook had a Jedi Vs Sith group that eventually became an RP forum with a huge number of people, full rulesets, corporations and fleets and planets being ruled by factions, the whole nine yards. That was something to see while I was active there.

As far as tabletop RPGs, there's a whole line of Star Wars roleplaying games out there. I have a very infrequent game going with some friends, and there are a handful of Twitch streamers playing the games (Roll Play and /r/itmejp has a campaign going on currently). They're out there. 

I think you may run into issues with Reddit as an RP medium though. I may be wrong - haven't tried it myself - but the upvote/downvote system and organization of posts doesn't seem conducive to long term roleplaying and writing. It's great for discussions of current topics and bringing up new things, but the sorts of pbp RPs that I was always a part of tended to have long, multiple-day-or-week posts between specific characters with overarching events in separate posts that played out over the course of a month or two. It would be difficult to keep that feel in a Reddit thread, though, again, I could be wrong or missing something."

Expect to miss a train now and then leaving the station because it takes off early or isn't there, but if you make sure you're at the station 5 minutes ahead of your train you'll be alright, just might have to wait another 15 minutes or catch the C line and transfer at Broadway/etc. 

If you're coming back, leaving downtown any time around 5:00, be prepared to be consistently 5+ minutes late getting back to Littleton/Mineral. If you drive that's not a big deal, but if you're catching a bus with a transfer window of <10m you'll probably miss a bus a week if not more."

Denver,fe6ongq,t1_fe69gjm,1578898375.0,"I mean, if you can take any train that comes and get to where you need to go it doesn't much matter if one is missing. If you're at Alameda and going the 18th/etc route then three of the five trains coming your way will get you there, so even if two in a row just don't show up you're not waiting more than 15 minutes or so. 

If you're at one end of the line or another, however, and only one train will get you where you need to go, missing one is an extra 15 minutes if you're taking it during rush. If two don't show up in a row - which has happened to me - you're immediately 30 minutes late. If you're also taking a bus, and you plan to be at the station for the transfer but the bus is late, and then the next train is late or doesn't show, all of a sudden you're waiting at the station for 40+ minutes. That hasn't happened often to me, and the few times it has temperatures weren't bad out, but I've been stuck after an Avs game in 10 degree weather for an hour before and it sucks.

For me, who takes a bus to the station to catch a train, then reverses the trip back, I am routinely waiting 15 minutes for the next one to show up because the bus is late or the train leaves the station early. And getting back from work the train is usually running late so I miss the connection, and then I'm waiting 30 minutes for the next train. To clarify, by ""usually running late"" I mean that the transfer has a 6 minute window between when the train is supposed to arrive and the bus is supposed to leave, and the last time I was able to walk to catch the bus was in November. Since we moved to where we are early last year I have never ridden the train back 5 times in a week and *not* missed the bus at least once, and it's a pleasant surprise when I only miss it twice in a week.

I tried tweeting at RTD whenever my train was late because it was getting ridiculous, but after months of doing so with one single response saying they've ""opened a ticket"" and complete silence afterwards I gave up. If my job weren't flexible I'd either have to plan an hour ahead just to be safe or I'd be out of work.

So, yeah, if you're close to downtown the train is great because you can show up to the station whenever and catch a train within 5 minutes, and even if one doesn't show up one of the next two will be going where you are. If you're on one of the branches and not riding to and from 10th and Osage, Alameda, or Broadway, the train is a problem."

In the original that distance is right around 50km (the Taiidan Fleet cutscene and trigger occurs right after 49km). In the remastered it's around 15km. I found this out because in the Original you could send a probe out to 49km at either side of the V to mark the distance you could harvest to, and right after that was where the Taiidan Fleet trigger occurred. In Remastered I tried the same, but 49km takes you all the way to the edge of the map. Took me multiple tries to get the right distance down - if I remember right it's about 14km, maybe 13.5 or so, where the trigger doesn't quite occur.

You can time the amount of time it takes to travel between points too. Either ships in Remastered move significantly faster than the original or the maps are smaller.
