He owns an authentic orange chiefs stadium seat, and the ONLY time he got up from it was to change jerseys like 6 times, ha.

We have more in common than my own sister, which I guess makes total sense especially if a guy has a ""type"" of girl he usually goes for. Their daughter is talented, beautiful, funny, and just an amazing kid all around. Every time they visit Vegas, we make sure to meet up to grab some food, and hit up the newest kid-friendly spots. They are family to me. I really wish this was more common. It's just easier, less stressful, less drama, and can be awesome if the parties involved are mature enough not to rag on their ex, or trash them every chance you get. I'm friends with all of my exes, but I will admit most are because I had to learn to play nice in a small town like this, where everyone knows everyone in the nightlife industry. I love seeing Juliana and Sarah get along, you can tell at least in the scenes we saw that its genuine. The smiles, Sarah trying not to cry, all that shit, you cannot fake."
