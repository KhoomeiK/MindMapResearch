Was the ussr a stateless society? Was it classless? Was it moneyless? No, then it wasn't. Was it its goal to become one? Maybe in the early beginning, but it soon was seized by the dictatorial bolsheviks, who believed that to attain it, they must go through a hard phase of capitalism and a literal dictatorship. But since they didn't understand that power corrupts, and those who accumulate too much of it are bound to keep it indefinitely, that stage would have never stopped.

You realise that coopting socialist terminology was a tactic to appeal to the people, since socialism was ""trendy"" at the time? It was literally in their program to destroy any forms of socialism. They dismantled syndicates as soon as they could.

The firms belonged to a wide range of sectors: steel, mining, banking, local public utilities, shipyard, ship-lines, railways, etc. In addition to this, delivery of some public services produced by public administrations prior to the 1930s, especially social services and services related to work, was transferred to the private sector, mainly to several organizations within the Nazi Party."" http://www.ub.edu/graap/nazi.pdf"

Representatives don't rule over the people: they represent them, and are evictable and replaceable at all times by the ones who chose them. 

In economy, to make sure no hierarchy forms, we have to abolish private property and collectivise the factories, resources, etc. Transform enterprises into democratically run cooperatives, so that the workers get the full value of their work.
