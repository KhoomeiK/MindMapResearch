SandersForPresident,fgu58qp,t1_fgtp64o,1581113503.0,"Maybe, but at least Beto had genuine heart. It was extremely obvious to everyone how much he cared about the American people. He was just a bit misguided.

Pete is as slimy and manufactured as they come."
GreenAndPleasant,fgsop8g,t1_fgslsra,1581089363.0,"Plenty of reasons. Did you not read the rest of my comment? You make a deal with the landlord— you pay off their mortgage in exchange for never having to worry about property taxes or hurricane insurance or affording all the random shit that breaks around the house, like replacing the roof or floor when the dishwasher explodes. 

There’s nothing wrong with someone wanting that simple lifestyle. You pay a flat fee every month in exchange for never ever having to sweat all the details (or random bills) that home ownership entails."
GreenAndPleasant,fgsio5r,t1_fgs4y9q,1581085321.0,"I’m with you on this one, man. Not everyone is a 17-property slumlord. Sometimes, people just own one rental in hopes that it will help pay the mortgage as a retirement plan. 

Also, what the other person is forgetting is that some people don’t WANT to own a house. It’s a lot of goddamn work and a huge headache. I have discovered that the past year when we bought our first home after renting for years. I don’t want to own again for a long time. 

So for the people who don’t want to own, SOMEone has to rent them a place to live. It’s not always “exploitation”. My family’s landlord for like 6 years charged us over a thousand below market rate because he didn’t think it was right to go that high. We were able to go to school in an amazing district because of his kindness."

oddlysatisfying,fgrp1kn,t1_fgrlsst,1581052859.0,Plus the camera work was truly awful.
SandersForPresident,fgqdb8h,t3_ezxbcm,1581022065.0,Why does everyone keep saying we won? The metrics are still frozen on 96%
politics,fgqcpsa,t1_fgppz8b,1581021802.0,Michael Douglas!! *American President* is a fucking CLASSIC.
FundieSnark,fgpnza4,t1_fgp88my,1581008614.0,Hahaha my mom tried to use that line on me when I dated a (VERY DEVOUT) Catholic boy. Absolutely ridiculous.
SandersForPresident,fgpfo5u,t1_fgpdpn6,1581003866.0,"My husband is. He believes “presidents don’t really DO anything anyway” and that Pete’s inexperience and failed policies don’t matter, just the fact that he’s vaguely “presidential”, 

It’s a nonsensical position but one I’m hoping he’ll drop later in the race."
SandersForPresident,fgpdz3s,t1_fgpbnwh,1581002876.0,"Execute Order 69! Birth control for all! Dew it!

What about the GOP attack on the children?"
SandersForPresident,fgobrp0,t1_fgobc84,1580964950.0,Lmao didn’t trump do the same thing and claim the electoral college was “rigged” and then never do anything about it once it helped him get into office
therewasanattempt,fgobdg9,t1_fgmsxhi,1580964626.0,"Well. 

“Decide”."
SandersForPresident,fgoa8yt,t1_fgoa209,1580963729.0,"Is Pete outright racist? I thought the entire appeal was that he was smooth and “presidential” enough to not directly come out and say or do anything that can’t be read like 6 different ways. 

I see that as the behavior of a snake. My husband sees that as “befitting of the figurehead that is the presidency”. 

I mean it’s frustrating but not marriage ending lmao"
FundieSnark,fgoa31q,t1_fgo9nbb,1580963602.0,"They don’t even look like PREGNANT jeans. Like holy cow they must be miserable for a 9 month pregnant, bloated-Ass person to wear"
SandersForPresident,fgo8z5i,t1_fgo84z4,1580962775.0,It feels like we’ve all been collectively edging for 2 days straight and it’s starting to get real painful lol
SandersForPresident,fgo8vpm,t1_fgo8j3l,1580962706.0,Do you have a source on that? I want to show my Pete supporter husband.
