AskReddit,fg87437,t1_fg83m05,1580611277.0,"I think you are missing the point a bit. While anxiety, IBS and migraines might occur more often in autistic people it's not defining of the disorder. Depression has a high comorbidity with autism as well, but so do a lot of other disorders. Same goes for anxiety and migraines (I am guessing IBS as well, but that's really just a guess).

Clinically speaking, defining of autism is developmental impairment in communication and/or social interactions. So someone who never had issues with communicating or social interactions throughout their childhood and later on developed these symptoms, for whatever cause or reason, would not be diagnosed with autism.

 There is a lot more, and different flavours of autism come with other traits, but these two points are clinically defining for the whole spectrum.

The graviton is a hypothetical particle predicted by String Theory. String Theory is NOT a scientific theory, String Theory (or M theory) is a huuuuuuuuuuggggeeee collection of mathamatical frameworks of which quantum mechanics and general relativity are emergent properties. Its basically ""all possible answers"" to the question of ""how to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, assuming that the laws of physics we have now are true"". It is not a believe system. Also AFAIK, if the graviton turns out to be true it would actually disprove, or replace (however you want to look at it), the big bang theory. How and what that alternative would be I couldn't tell you because different versions of M theory predict different things, which is one of the reasons why it's generally not considered a scientific theory."
