cats,ffmbv54,t3_eu5dwm,1580052028.0,When our cat gets hopped up on life he’ll chase after a hair tie for awhile. That’s about it.
nextfuckinglevel,ffm08s6,t1_ffllaty,1580046468.0,"If they spoke to him, found out he’s a mental patient, and released him as someone else said, there will be a record of this and obviously the video stored."
nextfuckinglevel,ffm05e9,t1_fflgdwu,1580046401.0,"Unfortunately, a thing called probable cause keeps police from being able to just tear this guy’s life apart and search his computer and home. At most the charge here is loitering and prowling (in the eyes of the ridiculous judges nowadays, not even that) and there is no way you’d get a search warrant for anything off of this. 

Plus, most of these psychos don’t usually shit where they eat. They would usually appear just strange to neighbors and then do their creepy shit somewhere else. 

The unfortunate reality is that any detective in any jurisdiction I’ve worked with is so covered up in ACTUAL rapes/molestations/murders/armed robberies that this isn’t a case they would even be assigned by a supervisor."

Braves,ffb2z8v,t1_ff7nqtj,1579750474.0,"Honestly, and this is hugely unpopular, I wasn’t a fan of the man anyways.
