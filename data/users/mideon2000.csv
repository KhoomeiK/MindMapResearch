AskMen,ffafglo,t3_esclmg,1579734500.0,"38 married with kids.  Wake up around 6. Get to work about 7 and ,depending on my route, leave around 3. Get to my little girl's school around 4 and pick her up. Go do a grocery run and am home about 4:30. Take my daily shit, shower and lay on my bed for about an hour and reddit. My son gets off at 3 and is home at 330. He gets the main tv till 6 or 630. I start dinner at 6 and eat and watch youtube until about 715. Wife is usually home at this point ( she does retail so odd hours) and we catch up and sit around the living room till about 9 or 930. She will be on her phone and ill be playing videogames. Everyone is a bit older so we kind of do our own things. Anywho, lay down and fall asleep around 11. 

Sat and sunday depend if i am doing overtime, or if there is something planned. If not, i park my ass on the couch and play videogames and watch football. We may have birthday parties, or i might have to go help my parents at their ranch etc. If i do any smoking of meats, it is usually Saturday nights. Sunday i volunteer at my church as a 1st grade teacher at 9 am until 10:30. I am a co teacher with my mom. Afterwards i usually cook a big family breakfast and........park my ass on the couch and watch football and play videogames. Obviously i do other things with my wife and family, but i am a homebody. I work hard and i rest hard too."

AskMen,ff87rdh,t3_es054f,1579668427.0,"Every decision you make will now have a direct impact on your life. You flunk out? You get kicked out and you owe money. 

You will become close friends with people, and while you may remain friends with some afterwards, much like high school, you will lose contact with most. So trying to fit in just isnt worth it. 

You are paying for classes. Go to class. You will preform better. 

You will have plenty of advance notice for papers, projects and assignments. Take advantage of that. Don't procrastinate. You will feel like you can take it easy and miss a class here and there, dont do it.handle your business.

Dont drink. Fuck drinking. And if you do, don't binge drink. Drinking is a bad and terrible habit masked as being a social activity. Don't leave your drink hanging around, and don't accept drinks from strangers.

Everyone is on a different path. Some are here to prove themselves, some are here to satisfy their parents, some have no clue why they are her and are thinking it is the most logical next step to take. The point is dont compare your path with others. Some may switch schools, drop out for grades, money or personal issues. You do you.

Know what you want to do so you dont pay for classes you dont need.

Dont take a semester off to recharge. It is a bullshit excuse. Suck it up buttercup.

Take advantage of services offered by your school. There are writing centers, libraries, fitness areas, and all sorts of other goodies that you pay for already. Use them.

If you are going far away, remember, mommy and daddy can't  take a 10 min drive and rescue you. You are going to have to depend on yourself and the help of others around you, so surround yourself with good people.

Just remember, call hime and reach out if you feel overwhelmed at anytime. Sometimes hearing a friendly voice is all you need."

AskMen,fdzif70,t3_enerdd,1578790529.0,"Don't slp around. Women get pregnant, not the guy. You get stuck raising that child if the guy is a deadbeat. It doesn't matter if he pays child support. You will be stuck doing all the work. In addition, society views men that sleeps around is a player. A woman that sleeps arounds is a hooker that doesnt charge her client.

Lastly, get to work. You can't be independent if you cant make money..if you cant make money, you are dependent on your partner. If your partner is abusive, you may not be able to get out of the situation quickly."
AskMen,fdzgfuz,t3_endw8n,1578789976.0,Yes
