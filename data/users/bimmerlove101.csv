todayilearned,fgtaiyw,t1_fgs0bpd,1581101699.0,They had a big room filled with food. Like a good month or two of food for a family of 5.   Must have had 50 gallons of water.   Probably felt pretty stupid when they woke up the next day and every was pretty much normal.  Lol
sporetraders,fgt5rz9,t3_f00ym4,1581099633.0,"The problem with this is that misting should be as needed.  Each house, school and building had different temp and humidity.   My house is very dry right now and needs extra misting.   Misting is an “as needed” task.  Not something that can just set and forgot about right out of the box.  Over misting will screw things up.     Too many variables and mushroom growing is about precision."
MushroomGrowers,fgt4qnh,t1_fgsu4ss,1581099015.0,"This.  

I just lost two shoeboxes cause they dried out at about 70% colonization.  Damn winter air in my house is so dry.  My tubs were setup the same as summer and I should have had them closed off more for winter.   Even my portabella block was requiring a lot more misting than normal

Time to start over OP"

todayilearned,fgqql77,t1_fgqixom,1581029397.0,It was so much hype.  I knew a family that stocked their basement with non perishable food. Lol
BmwTech,fgoucke,t1_fgnvzsa,1580986997.0,"Yeah, there are hundreds of sensors on F chassis cars that make the ecu function. I don’t know if it’s been done.  I would just build the motor if you’re planning to boost the fuck out of.  Would be cheaper than an LS swap, and you would keep the cars electronics.  I think you would lose the functions of the infotainment screen if you LS swapped a M2

I have 120k on my FBO N55 and I piss pound my car pretty often.    I haven’t had any mechanical issues and I do maintenance pretty often.   Oil change every 5k and plugs every 8k.  Definitely upgrade the rod rod bearings too."
shrooms,fgotu0k,t1_fgofxus,1580986303.0,Yup.  Now I check every few days and mostly just to see if any jars have contam
todayilearned,fgokbh5,t1_fgogtvs,1580973255.0,The only think that y2k fucked up was out schools lunchroom computers that help track of our accounts.
todayilearned,fgok6iw,t3_ezm6u5,1580973092.0,"He was probably sinking the ships himself.  Kinda like a pyromaniac lights shit on fire all the time, Charles Lightoller gets off on sinking big ass boats and watching the people drown....but then he feels kinda bad and saves some people.  lol"
Wellthatsucks,fgojmzh,t1_fgofi3x,1580972459.0,Damn....how do you know all this about Nazi medals?
