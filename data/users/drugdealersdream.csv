Tinder,ff9v20o,t1_ff9uanj,1579722088.0,"bc you don’t always need to “remain” friends? to say remain implies they were friends to begin with lol. it was just a date and clearly either are fine to have met each other, found out they weren’t soulmates and be on with their lives. sometimes it can be as simple as: going on date, finding that you don’t feel a romantic inclination to the person and just moving on from the sitch - not everyone is looking for or wants a “friendship” and that’s totally fine."

He was so shy and reserved, yet exuded confidence and passion at the same time. I followed him on his socials after and I was obsessed with how cool and just how effortlessly artistic he was. I have met him a couple of times and I think he’s such a cool dude—  I really admire his solo work and his creative direction. I think he’s such a talent and I’d love to watch a movie inspired by his life."

i truly don’t “think” much (gotta lay off the xans), and i don’t know much about politics at all but i was raised in a conservative, christian, black household that was against... everything. yet still i was able to decide from probably before middle school age that i myself should treat everyone with kindness, compassion, respecta instead of how my folks & family treated people. my teacher wrote in my report that i was one of the most empathetic and accepting kids she’d ever met (to my parents... confusion)."
