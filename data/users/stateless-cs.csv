immigration,ffgfg2t,t1_ffg8uc2,1579905036.0,"Unfortunately, I do not own anything back in my homeland as I hardly ever been there. My parents moved to the US under a non-immigrant work visa but subsequently died before they can change the status. I am thinking that I might need to wait for a few more years for EU passport, transfer my assets to my European accounts, then apply for F-1 for a better chance at the visa."
cscareerquestions,ffeu7hj,t1_fferbdq,1579865728.0,"Not from my personal experience. I was an analyst and none of my interviews were about toolings like Jupyter notebook hacks, Kibana, Tableau, or some company-specific processes. In almost every one of my interviews, I was tasked to design something like a recommender system, how do I mine user data,  asked about the fundamentals like regularizations, describe some data, or do some quick virtualization. Softskills play a crucial role in these interviews.

I am a Software Developer now and my interview outside FANNG has always been about tooling. In SWE interview for a C++ SWE, I was asked about some corner case pointer problems, some weird uninitialized variable issues, and Cmake. In other interviews for Java, I was asked about the life cycle of a Spring bean, DI frameworks, JPA, POM,  promise vs observable, and so on. Maybe some small coding tests but it is usually very trivia like a indexing with a hashtable. 

COBOL to Java might have been an extreme example. There is probably more COBOL code than Java today running the fortune 500, and it is unlikely to go anywhere anytime soon. I could also say the same for those who invested heavily in Ruby on Rails, AngularJS and trying to get senior nodeJS React jobs. It's tough to get past HR screening."
cscareerquestions,ffer462,t3_et566v,1579861368.0,"Problem with Software Engineering is that the techology moves pretty fast and it is hard to convince HR that your 10 years of COBOL at IBM translate to a senior/principal Java developer. So it is creating a problem where a lot people start chasing the latest and greatest tools for their resume instead of focusing on engineering the right solutions for problems at hand using available tools. 

Analytics careers experience, not just data science, does not seem to diminish over time. And Data science isnt an end all for mathematicians, there are many career path if youre good with math. Getting Actuary cert, for example, can lead to a very high paying stable career."

You don’t need the i9 CPU as a programmer in my opinion. 16GB is also more than sufficient unless you’re working on some large eclipse projects. If you plan to upgrade for another 5 years, then I would think 32GB is worth it. Otherwise you can do without it.

Getting a graduate role in the UK under tier2 visa is quite difficult as it is based on availability and the salary requirement could go up. Brexit sees a lot of EU exodus so demand for tier 2 is even greater. 

The UK food scene is pretty bad in my opinion and the salary is really low. Most of my Russell group graduates that need sponsorship are getting 25k offer out of college.

Indians on h1b can afford a house, a car, and future for their kids. You can’t do that in any other country even in western Europe where salary is much lower and expenses are much higher.

I was in the US for 23 years until my visa options ran out. To be honest, I regretted til today not trying even harder, and I would do it all again in a heartbeat."

I am living in the western EU now at the moment. EU is not as welcoming as NA when it comes to sentiment against immigrants. 


US is unfriendly against poor and hard working immigrant. H1b is heavily abused and over subscribed. You could go there on a tourism visa and perhaps get an American wife. You can also get a diversity visa and hope for the best. Lastly, you could invest $1,000,000 and obtain investor visa."

On my GCP host that takes less than 1 hour and cost me about $1. I also don’t lose productivity of my laptop while training model. 

I personally recommend MacBook Pro 13 for Mac OS for ML work. Homebrew is one hell of a package manager. Anaconda on windows is very clunky to setup right if you have a tons of ML projects.

Unfortunately, the only downfall is the lack of ports and unreliable butterfly keyboard."
macbookpro,fe4luna,t3_enr84d,1578860648.0,Docking station is probably better. Also Why would you get a MacBook Pro just to hook it up to some 1080p or 1200p monitor?
macbookpro,fe4l2ir,t1_fe4jrgy,1578860461.0,"I think depends on whether you need a laptop or not. If I don’t have a laptop or iPad, I would probably keep my 15 inch and get another Mac Pro. 

You are not getting any better laptop for $700 than the one you currently have. Most $700 windows laptop are the ones with crappy 1080p monitor. You’re not going back to that after using the retina display."
macbookpro,fe4ieh8,t3_enmnvl,1578859615.0,I wouldn’t expect a full 8 hours with battery replacement. Software is getting bloated over time in favor of newer CPU. My 2013 retina has only 200 cycle and I barely get more than 5 hours.
macbookpro,fe4hpnt,t3_ens9d7,1578859451.0,Intel is getting stagnated. There was a news that Apple is ditching x86_64 and moving to ARM within the next few years.
macbookpro,fe4hhkb,t3_enq3vf,1578859364.0,I wouldn’t even install the free trial on my machine.
macbookpro,fe4hes1,t3_elmagy,1578859332.0,2011 unibody is very customizable. I would go for it.
macbookpro,fe4h5zb,t1_fe4a461,1578859223.0,You probably better off opening it once in awhile for air dusting job. Then use it with the enclosure.
macbookpro,fe4gjbz,t3_enriiu,1578859113.0,"Have you considered eGPU? I used eGPU on my laptop when gaming and it makes it run very cool with little fan noise. 

I don’t game with my Mac though. I use Alienware m15 with its graphic amplifier. It is extremely hot with noisy fan without the eGPU."
macbookpro,fe4ezts,t3_enqikw,1578858583.0,You do you man. Happy that you found a good deal. There are always risk of getting used machines.
macbookpro,fe4e5ur,t1_fdzjkjf,1578858364.0,It retains value well for 5-6 years machine. I sold my 2013 for $450. Bought it for ~$1600. Windows laptop probably go straight to a junk yard.
macbookpro,fe4dtq9,t1_fcxh8t6,1578858239.0,"CPU uses the same watt so shouldn’t affect battery life by much unless you are cranking it up. It sounds like you will need 32GB of ram rather than 1TB. 

You can try using the base model and return it when your custom machine arrives."
macbookpro,fe4cua2,t1_fe439ac,1578857969.0,"Not a Mac advice but I would personally finish off the debt before getting into another one. If you’re making video for a living, you’re the only one who can determine whether the cost is worth it."
macbookpro,fe46s0x,t1_fdzdhl9,1578856295.0,"I recently purchased the 16 model, upgrading from exact model as you but with 256GB SSD. Depending on your needs, I don’t think you need to spend your grant moneys on this yet as it can be used for other emergencies. 

The ivy bridge Iris Pro model are still pretty decent. I used it til this years for Many of my java, python, and JavaScript Projects. I did a lot of machine learning(Skleaarn) Projects on them without issue at all. Only problem I had was to run eclipse on medium size java projects (60,000 lines), doubt you’re doing that in college. 

However there are some good reasons to upgrade as well. According to Louis Rossman, the late 2013 iris pro has a known common unfixable issue with its chip causing Random BSOD crashes similarly to the old GTX model. My machine has it but it’s not frequent enough to lose productivity. If you’re experiencing BSOD after heavy GPU workload then this might it. 

Furthermore, portability  of the new MacBook pro is much better. Despite having similar weight, I realized how much weight the old MagSafe adapter adds to your backpack. The new USB C charge is a welcoming change as it also allow you to use portable battery packs for extra juice as well. 

Performance wise I don’t really notice significant improvement to performance as a developer. Compile is much faster but it is insignificant for me. The 2013 model was already sufficient for most of my tasks. Hope this gives you some idea."
macbookpro,fe3v5fn,t1_fdxljxf,1578853174.0,4GB is fine for most tasks today. 8GB is better supported for 4K and multiple high res monitors.
