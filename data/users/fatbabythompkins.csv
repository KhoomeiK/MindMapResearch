moderatepolitics,fffen3c,t1_fffb6xk,1579882292.0,"Preface: I despise Trump.  He's a narcissist and, IMO, unfit for office.  He was a gross lowering of standards to literal reality TV.  I don't truly believe he has any ethics.  And I 100% agree that someone without ethics and morals should hold that office.  That said...

Do you happen to have any objective truth here?  Or are we just going on the headlines?  As someone said further down, is this feels or reals?  We're talking about a President and we're talking about setting precedent.  The ends do not justify the means.  When we view this through an objective lens, do we see enough _in this act_ worthy of removal?  

What this argument boils down to is a zero tolerance policy, one I see argued against for pretty much everything.  It's a first offense.  Is that offense worthy of removal?  Was their negligence or was there really a malicious intent element?  I'm not saying either of those scenarios are good, but one is clearly removal worthy while the other, with a level of objectivity, I'm not so sure.

Again, I agree with you, but I fear for the precedent it will set if not laid out objectively.  I can't say with any degree of certainty anyone, both House or Senate, is approaching this impeachment with any sense of objectivity."

Second, I would be looking for evidence of intent.  As I have said many times, there is a difference between a crime of opportunity vs. intention.  Did Trump know what he was doing was wrong and still did it anyway?  Or did he not know what he was doing?  So far everything I have seen is more the former than the latter.  It's still bad, a lapse (or lack) of ethical judgement, but not one I agree is removal worthy.  The latter is definitely, IMO, removal worthy as it really is displaying evil Trump.

Third, for such a nuclear option, removal of a sitting President, I would hold the bar to beyond a reasonable doubt.  As it stands, we have second hand testimony and evidence.  We haven't determined intent.  There's doubt.  That doubt needs to be cleared up.  

If the Democrats do that, which I would hold for any one, any President, and you have my ""vote"".  Anything less is not removal worthy, IMO, as it would set a very low precedence for removal in the future.  Not something I want the tribals to have in their bag of tricks.

The high barrier to entry also ensures little to no competition. And pole monopoly laws also ensure running cables is very difficult (this I somewhat agree with as we don’t want 50000 cables all over the place). It’s more aligned with power and telephone than anyone is really willing to admit. Make it a utility, set minimums that force infrastructure upgrades, and let large services (Netflix, Amazon, cloud providers, ect...) have a feedback loop into FCC to provide KPIs on when upgrades are needed.

I agree, conservatives need to be internally critical of what is going on.  Trump does not represent pretty much any conservative value.  He's simply anti-left.  Maybe the enemy of my enemy is my friend kind of thing, but it's a loss of credibility to lose your position of values just to stick it to the other side.  It's the lack of critical thinking and objectivity that makes me almost not even want to associate with, at least online, conservatism.

And I can pretty much say exactly the same for progressives.

I've said before I believe what Trump did more than likely occurred, but intent is still in question.  We need information to determine intent.  Did he know what he was doing was bad and did it anyway, or was this ethical negligence?  The former is removal worthy, IMO, while the latter is not, especially for a first offense ([Argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) is not an argument).  It speaks to his character, for sure, of being ethically negligent _at a minimum_, but that's why we have elections.  Most people I would even give the benefit of the doubt, probably.  I definitely agree Trump has a history of ethical negligence (narcissism is a hell of a drug), which is why I didn't vote for him and do not plan to either.  But I also try to look at the issue objectively and by what precedence this would set for future Presidents.  Until I see some proof to intent, I'll reserve judgement.

> * The decline in the use of AWs has been due primarily to a reduction in the use of assault pistols (APs), which are used in crime more commonly than assault rifles (ARs).  There has not been a clear decline in the use of ARs, though assessments are complicated by the rarity of crimes with these weapons and by substitution of post-ban rifles that are very similar to the banned AR models.

> * However, the decline in AW use was offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns equipped with LCMs in jurisdictions studied (Baltimore, Milwaukee, Louisville, and Anchorage).  The failure to reduce LCM use has likely been due to the immense stock of exempted pre-ban magazines, which has been enhanced by recent imports.

Further,

> It is Premature to Make Definitive Assessments of the Ban’s Impact on Gun Crime

> * Because the ban has not yet reduced the use of LCMs in crime, we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence.  However, the ban’s exemption of millions of pre-ban AWs and LCMs ensured that the effects of the law would occur only gradually.  Those effects are still unfolding and may not be fully felt for several years into the future, particularly if foreign, pre-ban LCMs continue to be imported into the U.S. in large numbers.

These are snippets and I would suggest everyone to go read the full document.  Especially if a counter argument is ""it wasn't in long enough"".  For that, see page 3.

> The Ban’s Reauthorization or Expiration Could Affect Gunshot Victimizations, But Predictions are Tenuous 

> Should it be renewed, the ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.  AWs were rarely used in gun crimes even before the ban.  LCMs are involved in a more substantial share of gun crimes, but it is not clear how often the outcomes of gun attacks depend on the ability of offenders to fire more than ten shots (the current magazine capacity limit) without reloading.

It's my take that limiting millions of peoples liberty should have demonstrated effect in an implemented 10-year policy.  We can equivocate on the LCM issue, but even that is tenuous even by the report's own description."
moderatepolitics,fdef56c,t1_fddee91,1578337673.0,"Here's some of the data I've looked at, because I try to do my own research rather than rely upon articles to shape my opinion.

According to the [FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls), there were 15129 homicides in 2017, of which 10982 were by firearm.  Under firearms is Rifles, which includes AR 15s and hunting rifles, which accounted for 403 homicides.  Knives accounted for 1591 homicides (almost 4 times as much as all rifles), blunt objects (clubs, hammers, ect) 467, and even hands, fists, and feet 696 were more than all rifle homicides.  It's the focus on ""assault rifles/weapons"" that is truly a poor argument, IMO, though I understand the sentiment (they do have significant killing capabilities). The relative number of rifle homicides stayed relatively stable (2.33%, 2.1%, 1.88%, 2.47%, 2.66% from 2013 to 2017).  

We do see a rise in homicides around 2015, which should not surprise anyone with the general increase in unrest.  Tracking against estimate population (https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-total.html#par_textimage_2011805803) we see the rate increase from 3.9 per 100000 in 2013 to 4.7 per 100000 in 2016.

When we look at the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf)'s numbers, specifically table 6, we see there were 2,813,503 deaths in 2017.  599,108 to cancer.  854390 to cardiovascular disease.  169,936 to accidents, 40,231 in motor vehicle accidents alone, and 36,338 to falls.  47,173 to suicide, of which 23,895 were by firearm.  14,542 homicide by firearm.  73,990 by drugs, 35,823 alcohol-induced.  

Granted this is just data.  Though firearms homicides are relatively low overall compared to other forms of death, they do have a very high rate in the 15-24 and 25-35 categories.  So too with accidents (especially motor vehicles) and drugs.  The killing at such a young age, IMO, helps explain one of the reasons for focus.  It's easier to rationalize much on the list, except firearms.  Accidents happen and drugs are addictive.  You might say it's low hanging fruit, but I wouldn't want to trivialize anyone's death.  More, homicide is preventable as it is typically direct human action rather than other forms of, mostly, natural cause (accident, disease, old age, ect...)

I don't claim to have any full understanding of anyone person's argument, rather, I try to understand why people would come to the conclusion they do based upon what they see.  I think, in part, that outrage sells.  Compared to the historical [crime rates](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm) over the last century, we have homicide rates similar to 60's.  That doesn't mean we don't have work to do, but we're at an almost all time low in relative homicides, with an all time low in 2014 (looking from 1960 onward).  There was a [quiet period directly after WW2 from ~1942 until the Vietnam War](http://www.jrsa.org/projects/Historical.pdf), page 38-39.  Again, that doesn't mean we don't have work to do, rather, is it truly an epidemic when we're at relatively one of the quietest periods (in homicides) in American history?  

I think, in part, it's outrage media and our brain's inability to handle so much information from so many places.  Modern tribalism doesn't help, either."
moderatepolitics,fde5s5d,t1_fddz7qr,1578331797.0,"> Your assumption here is that there was no ill intent.

No.  I'm leaving the possibility open instead of going to an absolute.

> There is no, ""investigate my enemies,"" without ill intent. 

There can't be any other reason at all?  Does that mean one can never, under any reason, investigate someone that also happens to be a political opponent?  I assume you don't hold this absolute and were just being hyperbolic.  There is certainly a right way and wrong way to go about it, and Trump _absolutely went about it in the wrong way_ here.  That's why I agree this was bad behavior, but not necessarily one, at this time, with grounds for removal.

> It either is impeachable, or it isn't.

False dichotomy, though I'll admit to mixing word use here.  Impeachment, the investigation, is absolutely warranted.  Impeachment trial, and subsequent removal, not yet.

Do you see how I leave myself open to possibilities?  That I'm not making hard, absolute judgements?  That I'm not willing to convict someone without seeing all of the evidence, even though I do think there was a wrong doing?  I'm trying to be as objective as possible by rejecting tribalism.  

I've said the same about Bill Clinton's impeachment, where there was even more grounds for removal (an actual crime of perjury on top of abuse of power), but didn't think it worthy of removal either.  I hold that forceful removal of office, the effective changing of millions of votes, should have a certain amount of wrong doing with concrete proof.  That is completely subjective, and I fully admit that.  As it stands, from my view of the facts, Trump had an ethical lapse (not that I'm claiming he had much to begin with) and was one of negligence.  All signs, from what I can tell, shows he didn't know he was doing something wrong at the time, mostly because he fully admitted what he did.  

I fully expect arguments of ""that's exactly what we're talking about!  He's a bad person and doesn't even know!""  And there's some truth there.  That's why I didn't vote for him in 2016, nor do I plan to vote for him in 2020.  That doesn't mean this issue has grounds for removal, IMO.  I can simultaneously think he is unfit for office, yet not think this issue worthy of expulsion.  Let me put it this way, do you think marijuana crimes worthy of mass incarceration?  The sentence doesn't fit the crime yet (I leave myself open to be changed with new evidence).  If Trump did commit bribery, with full intent and knowledge of what he was doing was wrong, then absolutely I will be pushing for removal.  But that must be proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Not alluded to by tribal politics and outrage culture."
moderatepolitics,fde16qv,t1_fdd5wa9,1578328854.0,"Preface up front. I’m not a Republican. I didn’t vote for Trump, not plan to. I’m a true independent that tries to operate, to the best of my ability, outside of any bubble. I lean right, which is the reason I flag myself a Classical Liberal, as the Republican Party doesn’t interest me, but I do lean more towards conservatism/libertarianism. 

See [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/26/opinion/sunday/republican-platform-far-right.html) from The NY Times. Look at the third infographic showing a fairly stable Republican platform and a divergent Democrat platform. This from The NY Times, not some right wing publication (and there is more data out there that agrees the Democrats have moved left over the last decade while the Republicans have stayed relatively stable). This would imply any shift in platform was from the left, not the right.

It would seem natural if your opponent is diverting away, at a fairly rapid pace, to be scared. If the right went rapidly into fascism, you’d be scared, no? That’s a normal human reaction, especially when you consider conservatism is hesitant to change by base value. It doesn’t excuse nasty rhetoric, but at least is a descriptor.

When you hear, daily, how the right has shifted far right, punch a Nazi campaign, and yes “a bunch of deplorable” on a continual basis, combined with the only non-left main stream media being Fox News (not exactly a bastion of objectivity), people are going to become more irrational in response. Again, not an excuse, a descriptor. 

You said you left the Republicans because of their actions. You went centrist first, now Democrat. We saw above a rapid departure from policy and arguably further after 2016 (Medicare to illegal aliens, tuition reimbursement for all, UBI or similar programs). I’m assuming, by your own words, you left not because of policy, but because of rhetoric. 

Let me ask a question: is it possible that the deluge of outrage media, social media, and online anonymity has given rise to massive tribalism? That no longer are we discussing issues, but always pointing fingers at each other, by article, by post, by broadcast, and that has shaped our rhetoric to the point we choose a side? Because any sign of weakness is jumped on by hundreds to thousands of people, instead of just the one or two you would normally have in a conversation? Finally, is it possible you have fallen for one sides’ rhetoric more than the other? I ask this final question because a lot of what you say above is from arguments of rhetoric, not on policy. 

At the end of the day you’re an individual. I can no more claim absolutely why you have shifted over the years than anyone else. It’s extremely more complex than any simplistic answer. Realize that every single person painted with that same rhetorical brush is equally as complex. I don’t think you’re a bad person. I don’t even think you’re a misguided person. I think you’re a human with the same thoughts and feelings the other 7+B people on this planet. Both sides? No, all sides, [because that is normal human behavior](https://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html)"

You can find an extreme in every group, point the finger and say, “how can you believe that?!” as a statement to discredit the entirety of a group. As if that one issue defines the entire group. And it is taken in the simplest and most contextless way possible, in most cases.

Do you not see what you are accusing those supporters of, you just did yourself? Taking an extreme position and applying it to the entire group? The brush is large and picture is very bizarre. Saying conservatives are unworthy of conversation because of cancer and windmills dismisses the entirety of what being a conservative is. Just as when a conservative dismisses a progressive because they believe in many genders.

Might I suggest, that if you honestly do not believe conservatives are worthy to have conversations with, you need to take a break.

moderatepolitics,fd4i3gd,t1_fd4enxr,1578167686.0,"No. What I think Trump did, how he went about it, was ethically wrong. I do not think, at this time, this impeachment worthy. Or more directly, removal worthy. Impeachment, the investigation, yeah.

As for Biden, yeah, I think that wrong and investigation worthy as well. However, it’s the how and why. Was Trump actually going for corruption, or did he see an opportunity to politically hit one of his opponents? That’s a question that needs answers. I’m of the opinion, given the facts I know, I think it more probable Trump went after him politically more than corruption. Though I think it was an ethical lapse of opportunity rather than some large scheme.

As I highlighted elsewhere, the ends don’t justify the means. This is true of Trump and the House Democrats, IMO. Both can be painted very similar. “They’re rooting out corruption (Biden for Trump, Trump for Democrats), but they have an ulterior motive to their actions (dirt on political opponent for Trump, removal of political opponent from office and a blocking of running for any future office Democrats).”"

I don't know why these have to be mutually exclusive.  People have this tendency to do something right for the wrong reasons and something wrong for the right reasons.  I do not ascribe to absolutes.

I think the offense investigation worthy (impeachment), but do not find it removal worthy, _yet_.  Notice I'm leaving myself open to it, unlike many.  I'm not condemning or acquitting the man.  My apologies if I have a slightly higher bar to enacting the ultimate political punishment."
moderatepolitics,fcybq15,t1_fcy8m4s,1578077770.0,"Maybe I didn’t spell it out properly. I agree. Wrong is still wrong. The severity of wrong is in question. Murder was with intent, manslaughter is without. At the end, someone died and you still serve time, but one was intent, the other negligence and they have punishment inline with that. 

It’s my assertion that, if this was ethical negligence, it’s not worthy of impeachment. Anymore than it was ethical negligence for Bill Clinton committing sexual harassment for sexual favor (though perjury was strong).

For Trump, I simply do not have enough evidence, myself, to judge either way. I do tend to think Trump more a buffoon than an evil genius, but I’m also not beholden to that, like so many others are absolute in their position. 

And I agree this shows his character. We can argue about mistakes worthy of removal, but I don’t think we’d have a very objective debate there. Again, intent. If this was an ethical mistake, then it certainly shows he’s, at least sometimes, unable to make the right decision and should weigh into votes. I know it’s a foregone conclusion for most in this department, but I don’t deal in absolutes or tribalism. Or at least try my best to remain objective. Hence why I agree something bad happened, punishment and/or condemnation rendered, but until I have concrete proof of evil mastermind, I hold for more proof, with an open mind."
moderatepolitics,fcy5u65,t1_fcy0ahp,1578075256.0,"This is actually where I line up.  I think it worthy of strong condemnation as I believe it more than likely occurred.  Now as for intent, I'm still weighing the facts (is Trump a mastermind that was trying to unethically alter an election, or was it simply a crime of opportunity and he didn't think anything wrong with it, or basically ethical negligence.) Either is bad, but one is with intent to harm our institutions for his benefit while the other was a lapse, or lack, of ethical judgement.  The former warrants impeachment.  The latter warrants a strong rebuke at a minimum, with threat of something worse to come if the behavior continues.  Either way, voters, especially independents, _should_ be thinking about their future vote.  (And as an FYI, I didn't vote for Trump, nor do I plan to).  

In this way, the impeachment, the investigation, did its job and made it clear something bad happened, but without all of the details, including and especially the intention, I don't necessarily agree with removal _at this time_ (I still leave room for evidence to change my mind).  I think there is a little of column A and a little of column B, but I'm not sure to what percentages and will never agree with an absolute (either way) without significant proof.

Caveat to include, as I've said before, I do not agree with any impeachment for political gain.  Again, this boils down to intent.  Are the Democrats impeaching Trump because of corruption or because of political gain?  The former is noble.  The latter is pretty much a mirror of the allegations against Trump (rooting out corruption, but with an ulterior motive to harm a past and/or future election).  I think there is at least some cause for concern here."

If the Overton window is the space between the two parties, and the left went further left while the right stayed where they are, the center of the window shifted left.  So even if you are in the center, the right will look farther away.  That's not because the right moved, as we see in the graph, but because the left moved quite a bit and that center moved along with it.  That may appear that the right has moved, but it is also can be explained that they stayed place while the left and the observer moved.  Or basically a study in relative vs. absolute change.

Now, again, we can debate the veracity of this, but I think it fairly well established that the left (in the US) has, especially recently, gone much further left than they possibly ever have.  It stands to reason that, even if the right hasn't moved, by a casual observer using a relative scale would perceive the right moving further right."
moderatepolitics,fcva3p3,t1_fcu7nxi,1577997804.0,"In my, admittedly getting older, view young conservatives are seeing numbers, in part, due to a traditionally anti-establishment mentality the younger generation is typically known for.

Some people are just going to rebel against what ever the dominant position is, regardless of value.  There's also a side component of trolling, just to anger those quick to anger, especially in the perceived dominant position.  

Colin Quinn in his standup special Red State Blue State said it best, paraphrased, Donald Trump is a giant middle finger to the left.  He engages through the preferred media of youth, online.  He's anti-left.  And he could very easily be viewed as a troll, or at least the center piece of troll behavior.

It does not surprise me, in the least, the rise and popularity of the modern conservative youth around President Trump.

My concern is the entirety of above is based on anti-left.  It has no position of its own.  It's simply to stop or troll the left.  Some may say that's good enough for them, but there are plenty of us that do not abide.  It's why I do not call myself, or flair, as a conservative.  I used to post regularly in /r/conservative, but rarely find myself contributing and more often questioning a lot of their content lately.

The center of my position is that immoral and unethical people abuse lobbying. It just so happens that a lot of money is combined with a concentration of immoral people who have incentive to be immoral (drive profits to make more and more money). That then is brought to those who should be for our best interest, but greed and corruption can be bought, through lobbying, by otherwise good intentioned representatives.

If I boil it down, if I could simply say greed, I’d be happy, but that doesn’t make good policy. It’s my position that free market capitalism is the rule and policy/regulation by exception, and typically only to protect the individual from other individuals or, in this case, groups of individuals.

Take net neutrality. As an insider to the industry, I have a lot of direct knowledge in this area. Telecoms want to alter their service by creating artificial scarcity, by manipulating service levels, to sell a tiered solution. There’s no motive other than profit as the problem statements are false or made by not upgrading (I.e. if they don’t spend any money, they look like they’re in congestion, yet have a very high margin on recurring revenue). It’s pure greed at the expense of the consumer. Lobbying should not be a way for these extremely large corporations to enact an unethical solution upon us, the individuals. 

Again, to reiterate, I’m a free market capitalist as the rule, with exceptions for regulations that protect the individual.
