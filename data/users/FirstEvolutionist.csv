There's no way that the amazon grocery store only scans the items. It need to track you through the store.

The tech exists and it has been in use. You think just because there are no laws that Amazon is not using for what would be considered illegal if we had proper laws? They are using it to make money, they are working with the government, law enforcement (ring cameras) and they are working with the military as well.

Right now they can do pretty much whatever they want because there are virtually no laws. They just don't have a tracking app that you can download from the app store because they can't make money off of that but you can absolutely be sure it exists because there's no reason not to."

At first it can be quite amazing. It falls gently and it's fluffy and reflects the light in beautiful ways. You can catch them in your tongue or on a glove and actually see the snow patterns! It's pretty neat.

But then that shit gets old pretty fast. First of all, it's usually windy so you can forget that gentle bullshit. Then, it's only nice when it's fresh. After the first day it starts to accumulate all the shit in the air and turns brown. It's also not fluffy anymore since the top layer probably melted and turned into an ""icy snow"".
