supplychain,ffauqls,t1_ff9pki7,1579744942.0,APICS is now under the ASCM banner. Definitely join them if you are serious about advancing career opportunities and continuing education in the field.
supplychain,ff8wfjc,t3_es7w9s,1579698333.0,"If you are pursuing a logistics/ SCM major of a well known university they tend to have a career center within the college and an internal job board for companies looking to hire interns or employees from your school. 
They will also review your resume and provide interview skills practice. 
 A professor in that discipline also typically has significant industry experience and can be a valuable resource to connect you with opportunities. 
Is there an ASCM or ISM chapter in your school? Students gain access to free or discounted educational and networking opportunities with executives and tours to companies that also open doors."

Maybe do some window shopping of open positions in the market and look for the qualifications and experience they are seeking. It could help you test the waters for some direction before diving in to a big investment."

selfcare,fdhomor,t1_fdhms6j,1578427059.0,I tried googling alternatives. Speaking out into the universe in an affirmative way is what I have found to be the closest to a non religious/ non spiritual option. Could you work with that?

selfcare,fdhk5nw,t1_fdhjt6n,1578424364.0,"Not encouraging that at all. Read it carefully. Time and time again, over sharing results in missing out on good things and exacerbating on bad things. Definitely seek out counseling and positive outlets.
Edit: how often are people truly happy for you? How many would admit that they are happy you are suffering or indifferent? How many are envious? Protect your energy and hustle, seek out healthier ways to express them."

supplychain,fdenj97,t3_ekx60v,1578342761.0,"Job prospect is good. Top expanding roles have to do with analytics and data science application in supply chain or senior roles. 
Pay varies. Have an internship or two for your junior or senior year to increase your earning potential per experience. 
Earn certifications based on your interest and economic climate in these areas: Lean, Six Sigma, CPIM, CTLD, CSCP, sustainability, ERP systems and analytics. Please look up these terms yourself. The top organizations are PMI, ASCM, ISM, 
Participate in competitions and case studies to bolster your resume. 
Ask your professors. They‚Äôll be able to help you a lot more as the instructors do have industry experience and can give you the connections you need to position yourself for the best opportunities."

This is my third year out of college and I am pursing and have pursued certifications to further my career. Please consider joining APICS or ISM. 
If you want to continue working in the procurement/ inventory stream, I recommend the CPIM certification. It is costly. Membership discounts help. Also consider Lean & 6 sigma certs as well. One of my goals this year is genuine networking connections. I started a group on Facebook for US Supply Chain Professionals if you are interested."

I know some huns obsessed with Monat, despite all the evidence it caused hormone disruption and hairloss. They‚Äôre just mentally too deep in pyramids ass. The product is never wrong, the customer isn‚Äôt using the products right. And if their product has a lawsuit, then it‚Äôs just haters and every other company has lawsuits too."
