What is his ring name? You can’t call him the Heart Break Kid or HBK or Shawn Michaels, all are owned trademarks of WWF.  Mike Highenbottom main eventing a Super Brawl doesn’t really have draw written all over it.

WCW was awful at booking smaller wrestlers by the late 90s. They had no idea how to use or capitalize on Bret, Eddie, Jericho,  Benoit or Mysterio. 

You deflect the Bret mistreatment but With Bret, you literally had him coming out of one of the most controversial and infamous events and wrestling history. He was a massive fan favorite and had tons of heat. And their move was to debut him as a referee in an Eric Bishoff Larry Zybysko match....
