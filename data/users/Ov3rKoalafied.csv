The 2nd year they had them, and this year it looks like they've improved even more. I think this is their 3rd-4th year. I've heard good things about freetaxusa too. Im sure TurboTax and credit karma are both selling my data but at least I don't have to pay credit karma to steal it.

personalfinance,fejqb7k,t1_fejk6kg,1579183132.0,"I'm using 50% based on the fact that the tenant has full use of one 1BR, I have full use of 1BR, and we share the rest of the space.

I said above I deducted half the mortgage interest, not principal. I'm not including any principal payments in my calculations. 

I'm aware that deprecation does not include land value and have accounted for that."
personalfinance,feh5eu2,t1_fegzhdr,1579109508.0,"This is the first year I've claimed it (new homeowner). Based on the article you shared and what I've previously found, as I understand it, it does not immediately qualify as passive income. however, I do have an MAGI of less than 100k and I am claiming well below 25k in losses so I qualify for one of the exceptions. Therefore I see no reason I can't deduct this. My only other concern was if this deduction should be itemized, but based on how credit karma handled it / some digging I'm fairly confident that this deduction is in addition to the standard. Thanks for the article, it was clearer than a lot of other things I had read."
personalfinance,fegyjg9,t1_fegxllc,1579105376.0,Thanks! You're in general agreement with the other commenter and my general thoughts as well. Appreciate it.
personalfinance,fegya7d,t1_fegx7p4,1579105217.0,"Thanks!

My state is a flat rate so that's generally pretty accurate, so I don't think I need to do anything for that.

For rental, I am not going to make a profit. I've basically taken the rental income I made and subtracted half of the mortgage interest, taxes, HOA dues, maintenance, and deprecation (I rent out 1 BR and use the other), and that amounts to a ""negative income"". I could do it your way (actually calculate the tax to be withheld per pay period and put it on 2b line 4), but that seems like a lot more steps and potential for error than just adding an additional deduction to 4b and letting the IRS do the math."

todayilearned,fc7vz4r,t1_fc7lre0,1577520074.0,"We also use/study way fewer materials than you do. Like mostly wood, concrete (and masonry), and steel. So we know the properties of those pretty well. So yeah, a mix of intimate knowledge of those materials and trial and error.

I've definitely had moments at work where I'm like ""oh shit, I just thought of something that could be an issue"", just to ask my boss and learn we already have a note somewhere in our drawings or specifications that cover that concern."
todayilearned,fc7vs2j,t1_fc7shw2,1577519933.0,"As an engineer I can tell you most of the slow rollout of clt is due to fire restrictions in building codes and contractors being slow to adopt (and therefore charging more to do clt). It's not that complex of a material and the properties are well defined (check our the CLT handbook, it's a free download). I agree though that some conservatism by engineers could also lead to higher prices, similar to the contractor issue (just because the analysis techniques aren't as refined)"
todayilearned,fc7vb5t,t1_fc7s2wo,1577519571.0,"Biggest issue with going taller is fire restrictions in building codes. One example is being satisfied that the building will be fire resistant long enough to evacuate. To the building codes, there's a difference between ""based on everything we know this is ok"" vs ""we did a ton of tests and know this is ok"" (2nd is what's required).

Also CLT is best for shorter span floors, so like apartments, and dorms especially. It's also gorgeous when left exposed, but sometimes fire restrictions make you cover it up. 

Biggest issue I've seen as an engineer is that a lot of  contractors don't like learning new materials (it's more financial risk), so they often charge more for CLT which leads to the project changing to a diff material. From an engineering perspective it's actually fairly simple. It's getting there though, slowly but surely."
todayilearned,fc7uqfq,t1_fc7u1sa,1577519140.0,"Fyi semi related wood does still shrink quite a bit as it dries out, so shrinkage is still a concern in taller buildings (especially buildings that have masonry elevator cores, as they expand. So some of your building goes up while the rest goes down). As you get taller and taller you basically need to try to mitigate the shrinkage. I haven't done any crazy tall wood, but some methods would be keeping the wood as dry as possible prior to installation (or even accelerating the drying process), and using construction methods that avoid bad shrinkage (wood shrinks the most in specific directions, so you basically try to avoid orienting the shrinking direction vertical as much as possible)"
