My pouch had a hard time with tuna. Ham/pork is tricky too. I did have some pork chop last night because it was so tender that it fell apart with a plastic fork (my clinic's guideline for a ""soft food."" Also removed as much of the fat as possible.

I had to accept before surgery that I was never going to be able to gorge myself at a buffet or a combo at McDonald's ever again. At least, not if I want to maintain the loss. I have head hunger but my physical hunger is currently shot. I can make my protein goal most days, but just barely. Liquids are easier, yet it's still easy to feel sick if I drink too fast. Dr Now's theory was that she was grazing all day. I don't know how; I'm supposed to work myself to a small meal or snack every three hours and I'm barely eating three meals a day (one being a protein drink). 

Bethany didn't stretch her stomach immediately, but she absolutely will. A lot of patients regain something within a year or two. She regained within four months. Holy crap."

Frugal,fdqkfvy,t3_emowvy,1578668825.0,"Eggs can be bought for very cheap. Milk is another cheap dairy product. Yogurt is often 10/$10 no matter where I go (and you don't have to buy all 10), store brand canned and frozen veggies often less than a buck, tuna packets are often around a buck. I've seen certain spices for $1 at the supermarket; even a small bottle of ground black pepper or garlic powder would last you awhile. I'm suggesting that last one to add some variety to your diet, not necessarily because it's nutritious.

A ramen only diet is completely unhealthy. You know it, I know it. Please look into food banks. Call around to save on gas. If you're that dire for food, DFCS will expedite your application so that you can get SNAP faster. Doesn't matter that you're out of state. The government doesn't want its citizens to starve, which is exactly what's happening to you.

I'm turning 29 this year and am morbidly obese. My lab work has always turned out well. Main issues besides morbid obesity that I have are that I have high cholesterol and I had a vitamin D deficiency (currently on supplements for that). However, while my A1C and fasting insulin levels are fine, they're perilously close into entering prediabetic territory. That's just one thing that I can see that could make my 30s a living hell. That's what ultimately pushed me into getting gastric bypass. I didn't have the co morbidities a lot of patients have like sleep apnea, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, but I wanted to prevent them from happening if I could help it. Losing a lot of weight would help immensely and WLS seemed like a great tool in my arsenal. One month down and I'm already down about six or so BMI points.

But I felt like I needed it to ""cope"" with the loss since I wasn't able to go to the out of state funeral. I distinctly remember that. It didn't ""kill"" the pain like medicine would. It simply buried it. I was distracting myself with the food.

I had gastric bypass a month ago. Underwent counseling for months to receive my psychological clearance. While I still have head hunger (it returned when I introduced purees), my stomach is still pretty meh on food so I haven't really found myself wanting to overeat... yet.

There was a 500 pound man on the show that was able to walk around pretty well. His mobility horrified the coaches. The reasoning was that he was lucky he could walk because he was so tall, and he was so morbidly obese his entire life so he got used to moving around like a normal person. Ergo, he thought he was fine *because* he could walk so well (and he justified his binges because he ate only \*salad\* on weekends). He was a very difficult patient for them, I believe.

2) I use one from URSugar, but I know a lot of people have excellent luck with the ones on Polish Pickup.

3) There's a lot to discuss re: stamping. A YouTube video may be the best way to explain this. Stamping requires a lot of practice and there's a learning curve to find what tools and techniques work the best for you. You have to clean the plate with acetone, clean the stamper head with soap and water first and then clean it off with tape or a lint roller between nails. Scrape once, twice at the most, before rolling and stamping the head on your nail. There are special stamping polishes, but generally if a polish is very opaque, linear holographic, or metallic, then it'll stamp 9/10 times.

I've been unable to get my medication between insurance and distance to clinic bullshit the past couple months. I finally have an appointment on Thursday so hopefully I can finally get a refill. I'm not at the worst I've ever been outside of surgery, but my depression (aggravated by situation) has definitely worsened. Strangely, my anxiety isn't as bad as it used to be when I'm off meds. 

As I said, if you're getting WLS, a psychological evaluation is usually required. While I hated that my counseling delayed my surgery by almost six months, I think it was a good tool to have. You might end up needing therapy before and/or after surgery, and that's okay."
