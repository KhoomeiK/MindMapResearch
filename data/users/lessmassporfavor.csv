fatlogic,ff0by4b,t3_eqyanm,1579467435.0,I bet these FA people thought they struck gold when they realized they could twist “fat is unhealthy” into “fat people are less healthy specifically because doctors don’t like them and won’t treat them”
fatlogic,fepu688,t1_fepnqeh,1579331407.0,Recovering party girl. I’m realizing this now as I get older and feel my well being decline drastically after heavy drinking. It’s just not worth it anymore
ibs,fepu18w,t3_eq87m9,1579331269.0,"Binge eating for me is a whole other issue in addition to IBS.

My favorite “fuck this and fuck you, colon!” story for me happened over the summer. I was doing the Whole30 in the hopes that it would help my IBS-D since it had improved my symptoms a few years prior. This time, it wasn’t helping much at all, but I was sticking to it faithfully hoping to reach a turning point. Then I shat my pants at work while in the middle of teaching.

That night I went to Chili’s and ate quesadillas and tortilla chips and margaritas, with my mentality being “what’s it gonna do?? MAKE ME SHIT MYSELF?!”"
fatlogic,febvlct,t1_febuwb0,1578963226.0,And having the doctors help people lose weight and thereby giving the insurance groups...less money?
progresspics,feao5pf,t3_enxmvc,1578950767.0,Major face gains! Your eyes aren’t being squeezed shut by fat anymore and they are GORGEOUS
fatlogic,fe6nlxc,t3_entclu,1578897177.0,"Not to be too edgy about this, but in a weird way I kind of agree. If you take shit care of your teeth and let them rot out of your head, and someone who takes great care of their teeth tells you your teeth are unhealthy, that would be completely valid. Even more so if you keep talking about how much you love your teeth. You can’t love something and take poor care of it. I’m saying that as a chubbo too. You kind of can’t say you love your self-abused body."
fatlogic,fdp7mx5,t3_embfp2,1578621895.0,Compare the physicality of Lizzo to Lady Gaga onstage and you’ll see why one is drastically fitter than the other. It’s not hard to walk around and sing.
fatlogic,fdp7ev2,t1_fdomh20,1578621745.0,"The deeper you delve into Lizzo the more you’ll realize she makes her size a major talking point in her work and online accounts. Her instagram name has to do with eating, and she posts naked photos of herself frequently while talking about her size."
fatlogic,fdmg39r,t3_em3sda,1578548724.0,What a wild ride. This almost comes across directly as “these were some great feelings that happened when I lost weight. These were some bad feelings I had when I gained weight. I hope no one else ever tries to lose weight.”
fatlogic,fd6hkvr,t3_ejyf93,1578191132.0,Self-harm could also be considered “resiliency” based on this definition. Try saying that to someone and see the kinds of glares you get.
fatlogic,fd0n1g3,t3_ejkive,1578121089.0,Anybody else get a full bingo on this? Lol I’ve done each of these! The only sustainable ones I’m still using now are IF and calorie counting though
fatlogic,fcjr1os,t3_eh8p8j,1577700318.0,This has “now I identify as a helicopter” transphobic energy. And I’m not even one to bring up social “phobias.”
fatlogic,fcjqyri,t3_eh8dh1,1577700196.0,"This totally isn’t relevant to this sub, but her mom’s first cousin would actually be her second cousin. Her first cousin’s child would be her first cousin once removed. Weird to include all that backstory and get the facts wrong. It’s almost like facts are meaningless to these people."
fatlogic,fcjlzim,t1_fcjjua6,1577693198.0,"I live in a relatively health conscious part of the US and work in an industry where people are very fit. I never see any fat shaming whatsoever. No one said a peep about my 60lb weight gain. If it’s not happening here, I don’t know where else it would be happening. I think any perceived aggressions these people report are things like weight loss advertisements and clothes not fitting. No one says shit to fat people"
ibs,fcj77nk,t3_eh63j2,1577678987.0,My dog waits outside the door for me. I can hear the bang of her big body when she leads back against it and slides down to sleep for a while. I open the door when I’m done and she gets all excited. I call her my “bathroom helper.”
fatlogic,fcidpb0,t3_ehael4,1577661010.0,It’s not starvation if you already have plenty of energy stores on your fabulous fluffy tummy REBECCA.
fatlogic,fcidam2,t3_ehc4u9,1577660840.0,"“Us fat girls have always existed.” Lol, girl no one is saying that taking in more calories than you burn is a brand new invention of recent times, just that it’s a lot easier to do now a days. 

Funny how grabbing a Frappuccino from starbucks on your way to a desk job, ordering food via postmates from your favorite sandwich shop down the street on your lunch break and eating at your desk, and swinging by McDonald’s on your way home are more conducive to weight gain than two servings of homemade stew between your hours spent at the factory every day."
fatlogic,fcarwl4,t3_egx9ut,1577575421.0,Jokes have been at people’s expense since....jokes were invented! When did everyone start getting such thin skin? Offended or “rubbed the wrong way” isn’t the same as being triggered.
fatlogic,fcarmhh,t1_fcaos5c,1577575265.0,"Not to mention, if you have lots of fat on your body you already have a full tank of calories waiting to be used up"
fatlogic,fbcaz7x,t3_ecfd5z,1576719803.0,"I cannot stress enough how much you should NOT go with this dietitian, or any other HAES “practitioner.”"
