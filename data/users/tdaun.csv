latterdaysaints,ff7zjib,t3_es0x9i,1579662120.0,"For my wife and I we just felt that we should start trying, it took us a little over a year to get pregnant. We both felt that we should start trying when we started and both were in the mindset that we wanted to have a kid. For us it just felt right; it's been a little tougher with deciding when to have a second but so far we haven't felt that the time has come yet. I always tell people that it's going to be between the 2 of you, God just lets you know if it isn't the right time or in some cases that you need to. If you both feel right about the idea of having children and it's something you both desire than most likely you're ready. It doesn't mean all fears will go away but that's normal; as the kid comes along you get the hang of things old fears go away and get replaced by new ones."
