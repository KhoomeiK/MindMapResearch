1. Religion - ""thou shalt not kill"".
2. Hippocratic oath - "".... Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. ..."".
3. Getting involed in a trial like this one."
belgium,ffwtsan,t1_fed502x,1580310822.0,So apparently after euthanasia the federal euthanasia commission verifies whether the requirements were met. Can anyone explain why this isn't being checked ***before*** the patient gets killed?

cscareerquestionsEU,ffubaa9,t1_ffu9wgm,1580238361.0,"Definitely not, after all I'll still be working in software development and constantly be discussing implementation of requirements with software engineers. So it's not going to waste in any case.

And, no I'm not expecting to be treated as a senior dev if I don't have any programming experience. I was just wonderig if I could still start in development if I wanted to at a later time. After all, I'll have plenty of experience in software development. Just not programming specifically."

cscareerquestionsEU,ffu4p19,t1_ffsx53i,1580234430.0,"Yeah, I really like that as an analyst you're involved in both the business AND the technology. It's high-level enough to not get grating (I don't know if I'd be able to program 40 hours per week for years on end... It must get frustrating) and you have a good amount of influence over what gets implemented, how the UI will work, and generally how the problems get solved. A lot of it is working with business processes and looking at IT from that perspective.

That being said, I do think I'll miss the satisfaction of producing a working product after spending hours debugging."

My question was more along the lines of: will employers think my degree is worthless/doesn't count if I don't gain any specific programming experience on my cv? I know some degrees become basically worthless if you don't get a job in them."

selfimprovement,femas66,t3_epvbqi,1579246357.0,"To give a serious reply: starting is often the second most difficult thing. It's hard to start because a) we don't know what to do and b) because we're afraid of failing. Yet the best thing to do is just start... Just do SOMETHING. Identify that very first thing you can do that's easy to do but that moves you towards your goal. Want to become muscular? Okay start by researching gyms nearby and training plans. Want to switch careers? Find out what skills are required to start in your chosen career. Realize that you WILL fail. Your first attempt will suck  and your second will too. That's okay. Failure rates are 95% across the board. Learn from your mistakes and build momentum. Starting is the second hardest part (regaining momentum after a setback is the hardest), what you're experiencing is perfectly normal."

dating,feht7z0,t3_ep7x31,1579123399.0,"So obviously she isn't interested romantically/sexually. And she probably wasn't trying to set you up with one of her friends either.

You seem to think she was trying to mock you. I don't think you should jump to that conclusion.

It's possible she just saw it as a platonic ""let's hang out"" and brought some friends. She was looking forward to a chill evening. You had different intentions, though, and the situation threw you off. You were unprepared and mentally psyched yourself out.

That prevented you from connecting to the other people there, which you interpreted as them giving you the cold shoulder. A self-fulfilling prophecy that ended with you thinking she deliberately wanted to humiliate you.

For your own sake, give her the benefit of the doubt. It was something unexpected, and you dropped the ball. That's okay, you can learn from it. And next time, you could maybe see it as a great opportunity — a hot girl just gave you her entire group of friends on a silver platter."

Give them a general idea of who you are as a person and what your life is about, so they can select based on *their* standards.

Frankly I've gotten over it already. 30's will be awesome.

Suffice to say that I'm (almost) in my best shape ever, I'm about to finish my second degree and am doing very well in my new career, and I'm about to receive a significant windfall.

The best thing right now, for you, would be to take a good hard look at your life.

List your primary life areas: finances, career, personal development, health/fitness, home/environment, romance, family, friends, hobbies, fun/bucket lists, community, charity/contributions,...

For each of those: are you satisfied with them? What do you want to achieve by the time you turn 35? 40? 50? 60? What steps do you need to take to achieve that? What are your priorities?

Don't just randomly do things. Decide what's important for you and make those dreams reality. You will never be able to do everything, so make sure you do what's most important to YOU."

The thing is, I'd love to have a reasonable estimate of my energy requirements. I know it's in the ballpark of 2200-2800 calories but that's a wide margin. I'd need to have several weeks' worth of data to even out the outliers, but I can't just *not* eat out for 1 or 2 months. Simply impossible."
loseit,fee43m8,t1_fedq0cz,1579025985.0,"I could see that approach working at a buffet/walking dinner. Load up on veggies and lean proteins, a little side of carbs if it fits the plan, a little something something not to feel deprived."

I think I should be less obsessed with the numbers. As I noted in a previous comment: even if you have the nutrition label (or the exact quantities), you'll still be off by 20% or maybe more. That's *before* having to guesstimate ingredients and amounts. AND that's not even taking into account the impossible task that is determining your exact energy expenditure (and non-energy protein and fat requirements).

It's more a matter of finding an eating plan and a set of guidelines that works for your tastes, needs and limitations and being consistent, I guess."
loseit,fee3c8j,t1_fed5cmc,1579025536.0,"This is certainly good advice. I just feel annoyed when my calorie counts are inaccurate.

Of course, calorie counts are inaccurate to begin with. Natural variation in the nutritional profile of foodstuffs, calculations based on some 'average' for a 'generic' foodstuff measured 20 years ago on the other side of the globe, manufacturers purposefully underreporting calories (because who checks the accuracy of nutritional labels?),...And then we're not even going into the biochemistry of it all...
