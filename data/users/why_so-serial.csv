politics,fekse0c,t1_fekq28x,1579206616.0,"“Uh, I don't know if you realize this or not, but most people seeking asylum do that.”

Immigrants are detained for UNLAWFUL entry to the United States, when their claims for asylum are received (and prior to release into the United States by parole), and in the process of deportation and removal from the country. In other words if they went through ports of entry and stated they were seeking asylum they wouldn’t be in detention centers.


“I wasn't talking about them. I was talking about the asylum seekers that are being put in cages. Yes, it's happening.”

A federal judge in Seattle ruled Tuesday that asylum-seeking migrants detained for being in the U.S. illegally have the right to a bond hearing in immigration court rather than being held until their cases are complete——literally the first statement of this article. 

These people have not traveled through ports of entry, they have been caught crossing illegally and upon their capture claim asylum. If they went through ports of entry they would not be in detention centers. 

“Wow, you imagined what my position might be and then attacked your imagination. At least we know you've got great strawman building skills.”

What is your definition of an illegal immigrant?

“There are lies, damn lies, and statistics. Federal arrest skew toward immigrants because they control the points of entry, so your sample is biased and any conclusions mostly meaningless. Show me the same data but for all arrests (and not just federal ones), and then we'll see if any actual conclusions can be drawn from the data.”

Prove to me that the statistic are bias and are “damn lies” instead of just making a claim."
politics,fekosag,t1_fekmems,1579204491.0,"I don’t understand your argument. Are you saying American detention centers are of lesser quality than other nations?

Edit: spelling"
politics,feknmhn,t1_fekm9lc,1579203801.0,"If they were “literally following the law” they would go through ports of entry as the law mandates. 

Those that cross the border outside of ports of entry are deemed illegal immigrants and rightfully so. This is a national security issue, there are US farmers along the border that law enforcement suggest they wear bulletproof vest while tending their crops because of the rampant illegal immigration issue. 

The problem is, people who think like you believe EVERY illegal immigrant is an asylum seeker. This is just not the case. 

I understand you believe your taking the moral high ground but this too is not the case. 

Non-citizens accounted for 24 percent of all federal drug arrests, 25 percent of all federal property arrests, and 28 percent of all federal fraud arrests.


In 2018, a quarter of all federal drug arrests took place in the five judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico border.


Politicians who declare their jurisdictions to be sanctuaries for illegal immigrants who commit crimes are needlessly endangering their law-abiding citizens.

In fact, more Mexicans than U.S. citizens were arrested on charges of committing federal crimes in 2018.
