BlackPeopleTwitter,fem0z0m,t3_epro03,1579236243.0,"My first two pairs of glasses were transition lenses and I grew to hate it. First of all, it's not as good as sunglasses and I was still blinded by the sun while driving. And second, it would take 10+ minutes for the lenses to go back to normal once going indoors which was really annoying."

AskReddit,feljkk9,t1_felcjel,1579223721.0,I heard that watermelons that have that brown scarring on the end means it's good
BlackPeopleTwitter,fecnwnf,t3_eoc7v8,1578978668.0,My entire class (of maybe 15 or less people) talked about our pets as our fun fact.

sewing,fe6fx22,t3_enyuia,1578889689.0,"I don't have advice for hand sewing, but good luck! I was making the same dress in a turquoise linen from the same tutorial today! Drafting the sleeves gave me a lot of trouble since I have pretty much never sewn sleeves before, but I think I finally got a pattern that will work. I have no idea how I'm going to finish the seams though since I've been using my sewing machine for everything."

AskReddit,fdtfk7q,t1_fdqd36z,1578716041.0,"While I'm allergic to the adhesive they use, it sticks pretty well and I haven't really found a brand that compares evenly. Sensitive skin ones fall off too easily, especially if it's on your hand and you sweat even a little bit."
sewing,fdqs41c,t3_emt56o,1578673693.0,"I don't have advice for a type of sewing machine, but I find a lot of patterns on Pinterest. Easier projects to start out with would be a pillow case/pillow, drawstring bag, scarf, or a simple tote bag.  Some blogs have video tutorials, but you can also search YouTube. I like to watch Annika Victoria, withwendy, and coolirpa."

cats,fdirmna,t1_fdi54xs,1578449495.0,"Yeah, after our cat got severely injured (possibly hit by car?) and surprised the vets by surviving surgery and another who went missing, we have kept all cats inside. It took a while, but our cats stopped constantly meowing to be let outside.  But we also built a catio so they can still sit outside."

sewing,fdfeot4,t1_fdfe9ts,1578359934.0,Thank you :)
sewing,fdesw1j,t3_el0jhl,1578345914.0,I used home decor fabric from Joanns. The tutorial might be difficult to follow if you have never made a bag before. Also I could only find Pellon Peltex 71F for the interfacing (don't know if there is more than 1 kind of Peltex) but I would recommend using a less stiff interfacing. Attaching the bottom of the bag to the sides was a major pain.
AskReddit,fd4qtum,t1_fd39fdk,1578170149.0,"I stayed in Munich for 4 days during my exchange trip and loved it. Really, it was a step up compared to the American cities I'm used to such as Dallas and Houston. Public transportation and being able to walk places was great, and the scenery itself was beautiful."
AskReddit,fd4ji58,t1_fd36od5,1578168073.0,"I never considered that rainy climates like that would be more prone to mold. While I don't plan on moving to Europe, I'm also asthmatic AND allergic to mold"
HumansBeingBros,fcpg8fl,t1_fcoyxp5,1577862621.0,"I wish I had you for a physics teacher when I was in high school. Mine was on her first year of teaching, and would basically tell me to figure it out when I didn't understand something. I failed nearly every single quiz and some tests and had to retake them all (and I'm someone who always gets As and some Bs)"
AskReddit,fcpfvos,t3_eic8yl,1577862171.0,"Redo middle school, high school, and half of college? No thanks.


But would I make an effort to talk to my grandma who passed from a heart attack and prevent my childhood cat from going outside for him to never return? Yep."
sewing,fcjjw42,t1_fchzen3,1577690530.0,"I do this so fabric doesn't unravel and become tangled with one another if there's more than one piece. It works great for smaller cuts, but large cuts (1yd+) tend to get a lot more wrinkled when stuffed in a bag and washed."
