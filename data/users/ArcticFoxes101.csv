loseit,ffbvqwy,t3_esrxvl,1579784382.0,"I'm there this morning. On top of that I've also hit the point where logging my food every day is making me think about eating more often than I would otherwise. It was fine for a few months but now this. So on top of not weighing myself every day im going to only be logging my food at the very end of every day and trying to eat to 1200 only when I'm hungry and without continuously logging, which has made me snack and try to 'cheat' my own system a lot recently. I usually underestimate how much I need to eat to lose weight so hopefully this will work well."

Advice,ffbsypt,t3_ess3sp,1579781601.0,"Try getting more healthy fats and oils in your diet. In particular omega 3s like oily fish, cod liver oil supplements, nuts and seeds and avocados. Sometimes we dry out because we don't have enough water, but other times it's because we haven't got enough oils. I always take cod liver oil when my skin gets really dry for the DHA/EPA and it is the only thing that actually fixes it."
schizophrenia,ffaq9a5,t3_es7rc2,1579741955.0,"Or you're reading theirs. Like an empath, or something.

But seriously, everyone has times like that happen, and some people seem more in tune with some other people (especially like close friends with good chemistry), and most people don't have anyone after them, and in most cases it's between friends which I just think shows we rub off on each other as people too."
Advice,ffanopd,t3_eski6x,1579740224.0,Probably because it always seems like everyone knows what they're doing but you. Except no-one does. We all feel the same way inside. I finished my degree with a great plan that I haven't done at all and am doing a career change instead. I'm 24 and I don't know what my life will be like next year. My parents are always doing stuff with a lot of certainty and do well but they're just plodding along trying stuff too. Honestly. Nothing goes as expected so the only waste of time is time you spend agonising about what you 'should' be doing. We all do it but just don't get lost in those thoughts. Just doing what you like and what seems like a good idea to you at the time is enough.
Advice,ffan1oe,t3_eskl48,1579739794.0,"You're kind of in the same boat as me where you have a business idea that you like but want some stable income and opportunities jobwise if things ever don't go to plan. I've decided to put my business off personally until I have a reasonable amount of savings and capital and stability, so I am retraining to do a practical career too (engineering). So whilst I like your fashion idea I think you'd really need to be clear on the financial details of this plan and how it would work before selecting it,otherwise you might be choosing an option that isn't even doable if you just go for it. So have an idea of how to earn and where to stay if you don't make any profit for two years, budget details for any training you need, etc..

Basically really seriously consider what you are able to do financially and how because following your heart is great when it is possible and a dead end if it doesn't practically work."
running,ffamjga,t3_eskl57,1579739447.0,"I agree with all that has been said so far. Just wanted to add that I seem to do better with flat shoes myself (my feet also over pronate), my ideal pair of shoes would be completely flat but with a comfortable sole, and wide so I can spread my toes. still haven't decided if I should bother trying orthotics. I think building up the time you're in them if you're giving them a good go is a good shout."
Advice,ffalrn3,t1_ff9fao8,1579738923.0,This sounds farfetched but it actually happened to my friend. Starts off small and is very insidious. In her case it totally wrecked the relationship.
loseit,ff9vafn,t3_esedta,1579722256.0,"You've got better quality and stronger fibres, your oxygen is being transported more efficiently. These better quality stronger muscles (including your heart) don't need to work as hard, so they don't use as much energy and burn as many calories. A little teeny weeny muscle would have to put in 10x the amount of work to move a weight than a big, dense, strong muscle would have to put in to move the same amount of weight. So it stands to reason that you use less glucose and thus less calories. 

Meanwhile your heart doesn't need to pump as often because more of the oxygen is absorbed and less is wasted than when you start out. When you start out your body isn't as efficient at quickly using all the oxygen in one heartbeat so a lot will go unused and your heart has to beat more times before your body can get the amount of oxygen it needs. Less pumps means less energy required means less glucose and calories used. It's a pretty straightforward equation.

On the plus side apparently just having more muscle bulk increases your base rate of calories burned when sedentary, because the muscles require more calories for daily upkeep."
ADHD,ff9uvp0,t3_esec91,1579721953.0,"Hahahaha! On a side note, it is truly amazing when you finally gain the self awareness to save yourself from yourself every day. I can't count the amount of times I've thanked my past self for knowing what I'm like and preparing accordingly."
Advice,ff9arki,t1_ff99zn1,1579708717.0,"I would say it's pretty effective over time. Like usually people take it for a couple of months, stop taking it early cuz they don't think it's doing much, then a bunch of symptoms they forgot they ever had resurface and they're like oh...ok guess it WAS working. That's even what it was like for me haha. I don't have a lot of experience but I've personally seen really good results in fibromyalgia, gut issues, migraines, fibroids and eczema, and have herbalist colleagues that have had pretty miraculous results in almost every kind of issue, although it's worth noting not every case has that kind of miraculous outcome, it isn't the best choice for every kind of issue.

There's one really good liver protective herb that is used in China to treat hepatitis even in hospitals which is also a western herb, Milk thistle (Silybum marianum), which is good to protect the liver from alcohol and poisons too. I don't personally know how far I believe heavy metal contamination myself - but I haven't researched very far so I won't knock it, but liver herbs like Milk thistle (another is dandelion root) would probably be a western herbalists first choice."
Advice,ff94our,t1_ff8q18r,1579704769.0,"I have a degree in western herbalism but not Chinese. I understand a bit of it but it's very different to western. And from what I've been told TCM organs are not exactly corresponding to the actual physical organs, so treating kidney chi isn't exactly treating kidneys, and spleen chi is also not just the organ of the spleen, since the spleen doesn't really do the same things biologically as the spleen in TCM does. But it's pretty complex and like I said I don't know too much about TCM.

I don't really get why I got downvoted though, I think it's fair to ask how someone knows what their spleen feels like considering its placement when herbs are more likely to cause stomach irritation. if you had said you have had spleen issues before and that's what it felt like I'd be telling you to stop the herbs and go to your Dr!"
Advice,ff94hqf,t1_ff8pbog,1579704635.0,Is she reeeeally mysterious and shady or do you just not talk very in depth...I guess you could ask her if she's ever done anything illegal?
Advice,ff8ptqc,t1_ff8p5bl,1579690897.0,"Yeah I was just curious how you were sure since it's in a similar place as your stomach, and indigestion from herbs could feel like you described... I'd talk to your herbalist about it anyway or lower the dose for now"
Advice,ff8pgll,t3_esa1ip,1579690379.0,"It's funny because I used to always think it was anxiety when I had doubts about being with my partner. In hindsight they were very reasonable doubts and I should have listened to myself before things got unbearable or went to hell. I only know this because in my current relationship I have had pretty much no doubts about my desire to be with them. There was one thing recently where I worried we might be incompatible in that way (the way we like to socialize with friends is very different) but after talking that through we found a compromise. And  I never ever wanted to break up.

Anyway, I guess what I'm saying is, if there is a specific issue(s), can you address them, and if they were fixed would you want to be together? If there aren't any specific issues, do you want to be together? I've said it before and I've said it again...you don't need a reason to not be with someone anymore other than you don't want to. It's ok to want something more. In fact it's a good thing because it shows you are unfulfilled in some way. You will KNOW when you're fulfilled, believe me, you would not be asking this question. I wish I had known this in the past."
Advice,ff8p4vq,t3_esa2fk,1579689901.0,How do you know it is your spleen?
Advice,ff8ov6g,t3_esa3vm,1579689498.0,"Your title made it sound way more ominous than the situation you described. If she is generally a trustworthy person otherwise then I think it is a safe bet that she genuinely can't think of what you'd like to know. For example I find it odd that for you it was important to know that she is still friends with an ex. I am still friends with about 5 of mine and I don't think that's a strange or important thing that would need mentioning. Like, I wouldn't mind talking about it, and your gf has said she wouldn't mind talking about whatever you want to know as well, it just doesn't seem very important to me. 

So with that in mind...what DO you want to know? If you don't have any specific questions to ask her, how can you expect her to know what to tell you if even you don't know exactly what you want to know? And then just ask, she's up for talking about whatever which is a great sign!"

Advice,ff7sb5m,t3_es4qv5,1579657151.0,"I feel like especially for you finding something you really enjoy doing is top priority, because if you can do that none of this comparison stuff will even be in your head whilst you're doing it. When you use exercise only as a means to an end it's hard to keep it up if you're not enjoying the act of it so the motivation is less in-depth.

Find something you enjoy because you enjoy the actual activity and feel positive doing it rather than negative comparisons all the time and in theory it should be easier.

I like dance specifically because there's more creativity to it, it's so fun it doesn't feel like work, and cycling because it gets me to work for free.

Btw I can't run a mile so... you might be starting way too hard with running if it is causing you pain. It shouldn't."
LSD,ff7s2mu,t1_ff47dnc,1579656987.0,I always used to gauge roughly how strong my tabs were by erowids guide to what kind of experience you might get at which dose and then compare it to what seller claimed it to be plus how my trip colleagues experienced it.

LSD,ff7rc5k,t3_es4l5t,1579656481.0,"If it's from the same dealer try something else, if not and you're pretty sure it's acid, I know one guy that doesn't get visuals. Never quite figured it out. the one time he got visuals was when he took a cocktail of LSD, cocaine and ketamine...I do not recommend that, he is kind of a machine,I definitely wouldn't do that personally. You could always try shrooms or DMT instead, DMT is very visual heavy."
LSD,ff7qz2m,t3_es47cg,1579656223.0,"Have music set up beforehand. I can't fathom technology when I'm tripping. Have a variety of music types or genres, maybe on separate tabs or something, so you can pick and choose if a particular genre isn't fitting your vibe. 

Mood lighting is also quite essential. It makes or breaks a trip on the come up. It's not quite as essential later on but still gorgeous. Glow sticks, soft lamps, fairy lights."
LSD,ff7qqdy,t3_es4e9c,1579656056.0,"Well it makes sense to be crying about a pain that you've had for a while (loneliness and wanting to feel close to someone and loved). I had a trip that made me very emotional for a month or so afterwards but I found it pleasant because my feelings usually get stuck so it felt really good for them to flow. It does go back to normal eventually, if you want it to. But the best way to comfort yourself in this case I feel is to surround yourself with some friends or family or anyone you feel genuinely cares about you which should hopefully help you feel less lonely and more loved and help the feelings somewhat."
LSD,ff7qeuc,t3_es4htk,1579655835.0,For a first trip I'd take half just in case. And then obviously you can try a full one some other time if the effects aren't extremely obvious.
LSD,ff7qb9a,t1_ff6meip,1579655764.0,That's fair. I had a weird experience on shrooms where I can only describe I literally felt like an animal. Like no concept of anything at all really except the very basic fear or pleasure. Very different to my LSD trips. Yeah I think the first time was mind blowing but the second time it did seem pretty simple haha

Advice,ff61hq6,t3_erv63p,1579616728.0,"Meds are nowhere near enough for you. You need a lot of emotional and psychological support. It's not an easy process to undo the damage that has happened, but focus on one thing at a time, step by step. Perhaps the first step would be to focus on stopping taking drugs. It's kind of impossible to fix your head when you're taking drugs, I have recently watched good friends go very fast off the rails on them. like their headspace sucked before but the drugs made them full on disassociate and attack people, hallucinate and have psychotic breaks...one of them has managed to stop and has her head much more under control now and is happier.

I know the drugs start cuz of the fucked up shit, but you can't keep using it as an excuse to keep taking them if you really want to start putting things right in your life, the life you now have control over that you didn't have when you were younger. Accept responsibility for your actions now and work on it. Best of luck to you."
Advice,ff60wly,t3_erv5is,1579616282.0,"This may sound silly, but one theory could be that you're finally getting over them. As you said you're in a very loving and stable relationship. Sometimes emotions take years to begin processing, and sometimes only when you feel stable and safe. Part of getting over someone is after the initial negative feelings remembering what was good, what you did like about them, and basically integrating the experience into your life as a whole rather than just the negative part of that experience.

If it's not that then I have no idea!"
LSD,ff60d6o,t1_ff5r50e,1579615865.0,"Yeah that is a possibility. I also had a friend that didn't feel anything on acid till eventually he took a dose high enough that he felt it , but he doesn't remember most of the trip, it's a blank...keep upping till you get there I suppose! Or if you're adventurous cocktail it with weed, DMT, cocaine or mdma... But research into that of course first, don't be trying it blind, especially regarding your meds."
LSD,ff5q0fv,t3_ert746,1579605472.0,Probably like 300-400ug+. But some people need more. And I've found it to almost always be pretty introspective regardless of dose...

LSD,ff4np79,t3_erjtku,1579568049.0,"Depends what you mean by it. Way I see it is your ego is basically your image of yourself and how you see yourself in relation to others. The point at which you stop distinguishing any difference between you and others or other things around you as being separate from you is what I would call ego death. Like say you were in a room and someone else in the room did something and you basically thought they were you and you did that. And you were like that with everything.

I've had more trips where this hasn't happened than I have where it has, so ego death is how I distinguish that kind of trip because I feel it is an accurate description."

What I'm trying to do is purposely ground myself in doing things in the here and now as me. Trying to really cement my own idea of myself in my head, or create a new one that will stick. Deciding that small things matter and just learning new skills. And trying to put the trip on the back burner. Meeting people and enjoying their company.

Next time I took 225ug and still I slipped very easily into ego death and seeing everything as one (very visually) and that everything and everyone is already in existence and we are all one, everything being experienced at the same time.

All I can say is it is hard but as long as you are always trying to be understanding of others, if they are putting you down for no reason then the truth will be self evident to anyone intelligent that they are being unreasonable, and you will know that you tried your best too.

Having said that if you do express something that is a sensitive sore spot for other people you can't expect people to not have a reaction; you have to tread and navigate carefully with what you say. It'd be like if I said ""I don't get what the big deal is about cancer anyway, it's got a 70% survival rate nowadays"". It's gonna upset a lot of people for whom this is a very sensitive and personal topic. Just because it isn't for me because I was so lucky to escape being burned by it doesn't mean that is the case for others, and I shouldn't expect them to feel the same way that I do.

Advice,ff0khp7,t3_er1uj3,1579469729.0,"My close friend, who is like family to me, had a very abusive childhood and if he ever expressed emotions he was shut down or beaten or just abandoned. It's affected him really badly, though he is slowly learning to express things step by step with people he now trusts.

Emotions are completely natural responses that we use to process information and give cues to people around us. When we are angry, we are expressing that our boundaries have been crossed and to back off. When we are sad and crying, we are expressing that we need comfort from people that care about us around us in that moment. Expressing emotion around people that are open to connecting with you will help you become closer with them and build a solid, deeply satisfying relationship with them. 

If you're able to express something there and then, it usually will pass and you will feel healthier emotionally afterwards. If it is suppressed, generally you will end up running into issues down the line.

Some people don't understand emotions well and raise their kids strictly and unemotionally. They were probably raised the same way and can't teach you emotional intelligence when they don't have any themselves.

Like, it happens. Obviously I didn't mean to but I was desperate. 

One of my besties that originally introduced me to acid started randomly getting panic attacks at a certain point in the trip. He never used to have them,and it was definitely acid,we took it together. He's basically stopped taking it now. We don't have an explanation for it but in his situation and in your friend's, they are better off without. It is a shame because it is a wonderful drug but for some people it isn't worth it after a while, like when I stopped smoking weed after the paranoia got too much. I also wish I knew why it happens sometimes but I just don't."
schizophrenia,ff0909r,t1_fezkhq5,1579466489.0,"Yeah, not sure I have either. Just never had anyone describe anything like that to me.

Ha, I smoked DMT and reality very much melted around me, it doesn't matter if I have my eyes open or closed on psychedelics when I'm tripping hard, I'm seeing the same stuff. I have a friend that is like you though, very minimal visual effects on psychedelics.

I have had some dreams that have been incredibly vivid and true they are nothing like what I see in the pictures in my mind when I imagine. But most of my dreams lack visual detail in the same way it would if I imagine something, and lack imaginary bodily sensation. It's all a bit dulled. Exciting storylines but also kind of flattened and 2D. Which is also how I imagine things, kinda flattened and 2D without much detail, like some kind of art or something. Just since I'm asleep I'm not thinking it isn't real. But LSD and DMT visuals look far more life-like to me, higher levels of detail and dimensions, plus of course the fact I am physically seeing it in front of me, not just in some mini cinema room inside my head.

Yeah, I think it's incredibly important to be very precise about what people are meaning by their words because like you said, it's very hard to have any idea what other people are experiencing since it's very natural for us to assume everyone around us is experiencing things the same way. It's exciting when we find differences, I think.

Edit: just found out my friend can physically imagine things in the room like that with her. She is a marvelous engineer. She said the main difference when she took acid was she didn't focus on making it happen, it was spontaneous, whereas normally she would do it intentionally. But the images were both as 'real' in front of her eyes.

That's the other thing, in SZ I feel like hallucinations are more spontaneous and uncontrollable from the sounds of it."

Advice,fez7j3z,t3_eqt3rf,1579454492.0,"I cut a friend out when she had a total mental breakdown and was disassociating a lot and attacking my friends, full on attacking, punching and stuff and screaming and the police were called. She was really unwell that year. We cut her out because it really shocked us all. Anyway a year and a bit later we are friends again because she is doing a lot better and is more stable. It sucks because obviously she was super upset we had abandoned her, and I also wish we hadn't, but in her own words even her mum couldn't handle her at that time so it's not surprising her friends couldn't either. But we have both agreed that we're actually closer now than we used to be now that we have reconnected.

Now I am the first person to be ok with cutting out relationships that don't work for me, but if we were only friends with people that never made mistakes, no-one in the world would have any friends. We like people because we just do. It is also ok to distance from people but still care from a distance. Basically, moderation, care and self-care."

As for myself, I definitely don't think I am over imaginative imagery wise, it is all like a dream and not so vivid (not like LSD for example!!!) but I guess like you said compared to many of my friends it is more than their norm so that was the assumption I made. I also used to daydream a shit ton, like probably 70% of the time as a kid/young teen so whilst those weren't massively vivid either I spent an inordinate amount of time doing it which was another factor in my hypothesis.

But yeah I'll look into it."

schizophrenia,feyrbv8,t1_feypngr,1579449692.0,"Because I have discussed it with people I know. Compared with them I am reasonably good, some of them don't have a very visual imagination. And most of them don't get the random image flashes in their minds eye after watching scary films and thus don't get anxiety afterwards like I do. In fact a lot of my anxiety is based on intrusive visual thoughts of what might happen and when I have explained this to friends they did not have the same experience. So for the sample I had that is the conclusion I drew. Thanks for being a little condescending about my experience.

Advice,feyqwp3,t1_feyojql,1579449450.0,"Yeah, clearly nothing you're doing at the minute does, I would experiment a bit with different clubs, sports, online stuff,  go to some music concerts maybe...try getting creative with art or hair or clothing...try and track your cues to see if you would prefer to be indoors or outdoors, really keep track of how different activities and environments make you feel, different foods, different thoughts and situations....journal it or keep note somewhere if you need to. Just become more self aware and follow what feels good or at least better than other things .

schizophrenia,feycxav,t1_ferv092,1579443914.0,"I wouldn't say I really see what I imagine. Like, I see a picture inside my head, like a dream, so I don't have aphantasia, but it's not directly in front of me, like a hallucination. And also it's not quite as vivid. If I imagine a voice, it is also not very vivid or as clear as if it came from the external. There's a pretty big difference.

The only thing that confuses me sometimes is when I'm tired in bed and random voice thoughts appear in my head. They still aren't vivid and clear like actual voices in the external, they are obviously still thoughts, but not ones I'm imagining on purpose which is why they are weird, I would usually direct my imagination (visually too except after I've watched a scary movie and then I might get a flash of an unwanted scary image in my head, still very obviously not a real image in front of my eyes, but unnerving nonetheless)

I see the point you are trying to make but my imagination is reasonably vivid compared with most people and even then it's nothing like a hallucination or reality."

The thing is I'm not even saying I completely don't believe in their existence. But I am saying that what is important is that you are safe and that your quality of life is restored. At least doctors are legally obliged to look after your health and sanity.

Anyone can say anything on the internet. Maybe they even believe it themselves. People deny climate change and the shape of the earth nowadays too. I'm sorry that you've been scared to go to a doctor, but it seems the obvious choice over some of the things that have been suggested to you online."

I only think it's you feeling anxious because you've already said that it doesn't happen to you really, you're just worried it will.

The more you do it the more your brain will become convinced that it is ok and the anxiety should stop.

It's unfortunate this is happening to you but keep making friends in your own way, the people that truly know you will know and appreciate your character.
