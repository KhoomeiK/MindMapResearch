This is really not true. Germany only unified in the 1870s, and even since has always been very decentralised. The current borders of Berlin were not established until the 1920s, when lots of small villages were merged together with the explicit intention of creating a larger capital city.

One of the main reasons that the Nazi regime invested heavily in grand infrastructure projects for Berlin was that they were embarrassed that their national capital was so tiny and provincial in comparison to London, Paris, Moscow and Rome."

AskEurope,fe37t6g,t1_fdy72pv,1578846790.0,"One of the biggest benefits of constitutional monarchy is that the monarch is completely undeserving of the position. It sounds strange but hear me out...

It's extremely important to have separation between head of government and head of state. Countries with this arrangement are far more stable than those with a combined president. The head of state acts as the neutral arbiter of democracy, with the head of government having all of the actual power. Some countries (eg. Germany) achieve this with an elected head of state separate from the elected head of government - but there's a big problem. By virtue of being elected the head of state has some degree of legitimately - someone could literally run for office on the platform of overriding the government - and if they win then they have a genuine democratic mandate to do so. A monarch has absolutely no democratic mandate, and also has a much larger investment in ensuring stability because their children and grandchildren will inherit the consequences of their actions. It's good to have a head of state looking at a multi-generational timeline as opposed to politicians who by neccesity tend to only operate in 5-year blocks."
