I understand why this won the Goodreads choice award for history & biography because it is brilliant! I love the way the author focused on the lives of the women and the choices that led to them being in the place where they were murdered, while simultaneously giving no attention to the notorious killer. Each biography delved into a different facet of life in Victorian England, and I feel as though I learned a lot about it as a whole!

This week, I finished **So You Want to Talk About Race** by Ijeoma Olou. This is a very powerful, must-read book. 

I DNF'd **The Archarnians** by Aristophanes. Not only is the narrative absurd and reliant on knowing who the contemporaries of Ancient Greece were in order to appreciate the jokes, but I got to a point in the play when a poor father looked at his two young girls and said, ""Would you rather starve or be slaves."" ""Be slaves, be slaves!"" **NO.** This is the second play by Aristophanes that I've read (the first being Lysistrata, which I finished albeit with a lot of eye rolling) and I feel like I've sampled enough to avoid the others. 

I'm currently in the middle of reading **The Kingdom of Copper** by S.A. Chakraborty. It's been a while since I read *The City of Brass* and I'm having a little bit of difficulty reconnecting with the characters again (particularly since Nahri has been stripped of all power/agency to start) but my favourite part of the books, the world building, still entrances me. 

I just started **The Five** by Hallie Rubenhold and **Hurts to Love You** by Alisha Rai, both of which I'm very excited to read! 

Happy reading!"

AskHistorians,fcye0gw,t3_e78gzk,1578078659.0,"I read too many wonderful books last year to list them all, so here my top three non-fiction books I loved most last year. 

**Quackery: A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything** by Lydia Kang and Nate Pedersen. This book is *hilarious* and informative! 

**Murder by the Book** by Claire Harman, recounting a murder/investigation/execution in 1840 London, England. I love this era, so I found it fascinating! 

**The Amazons** by Adrienne Mayor. A very in-depth look at the evidence to support female warrior horsewomen behind the exaggerated myths. 

Honorable mention: **The Rise and Fall of Dinosaurs** by Steve Brusatte, which was informative and made me want to seek out other books on the subject but had too many personal anecdotes for my tastes. 

On my reading list for 2020: 

*SPQR* by Mary Beard

*Laughter in Ancient Rome* by Mary Beard

*In Bed with the Ancient Egyptians* by Charlotte Booth

*Gods and Robots* by Adrienne Mayor

*The First English Detectives* by J.M. Beattie

*A Certain Share of Low Cunning* by David J. Cox

*Inglorious Empire* by Shashi Tharoor

*Women Warriors* by Pamela D. Toler

*The Butchering Art* by Lindsey Fitzharris

This week, I read **A Girl Like Her** by Talia Hibbert. She's the author of my favourite book of the year (*Get a Life, Chloe Brown*) and this is one of her earlier books. It was good but not the OMG WOW MUST READ MORE of Chloe Brown. 

I am so, soooo close to finishing up the other three books I have on the go. I only have a couple hours left in **The Name of All Things** by Jenn Lyons. It took me a long time (over half the book) to get really hooked on this the way I was with book 1, but now that I am, I foresee finishing this today. 

And I'll have time to finish **Wyrd Sisters** by Terry Pratchett, too! It's not my favourite Discworld book so far, but his prose remains top notch and hilarious. 

After that, I'll have two days to finish the last few hours of **Policing Black Lives** by Robyn Maynard. I've learned a lot so far and recommend this book, especially to fellow Canadians.
