AskWomen,ffk1tyl,t3_etdutg,1580013220.0,I'm 37 and I still go like once in a blue moon (maybe 4 times a year).  I was a former dancer and I have lots of friends who throw events and DJ.  The clubs I go to are more chill and not the dress up vibe though.  Sometimes I want to see a really good DJ or dance.  I usually go to restaurants and bars more though.

AskReddit,fds5616,t3_emr80h,1578694594.0,"People describe me as an extrovert.  I'm great in socially, friendly and confident.  You can throw me in any type of social setting (dinner parties, parties, clubs, family events).  I (usually) instantly get along with people and can strike up a conversation on a variety of topics.  My exbf said that I have resting nice face because people love to talk to me.  I grew up the oldest in a large family (and extended family too) so I learned how to balance out different personalities (my dad and half my siblings have bad tempers).  I can get anyone to talk to me without being pushy because I am sincere.  I however don't consider myself an extrovert because I just love to stay home alone.  I love to read books, watch movies and stay home with my cats.  I go to certain events because it will be a big one (holidays, birthdays, baby showers, weddings, etc...)  I think naturally I am in introvert, but developed introvert skills from being one of the oldest in a large family."
