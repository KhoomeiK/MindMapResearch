PlayTemtem,ffhhpjo,t1_ffhg4db,1579935730.0,Thanks man you're right. I'm honestly just excited about this game. Been wanting a pokemon MMO since I was a kid and these guys are doing it but better with their own monsters. Gonna get it on steam but I dont have the time to play pc much so I'm honestly most excited for the switch release.  Wish it wasn't a year away. Hopefully itll be cross platform

MadeMeSmile,ffezhri,t1_ffez0z5,1579871361.0,Nah it's the same. To your adult mind it may be different.  Not not a kid. I'm only saying this because before I had a kid I would have thought the exact same way. Now that I have one I realize you just cant apply our grown logic to their tiny minds. They be able to absorb things like a sponge but they just work on such a simpler level you'd have to experience it firsthand to even understand what I mean

MadeMeSmile,ffexo1i,t1_ffex2bt,1579869615.0,"Problem is you probably assume he's doing this all the time. As a dad of a toddler I can tell you there's a huge chance he's not. And letting your kid feel like they did something amazing every once in a while brings them and yourself joy. Also for all you know they just posted this for fun on their Facebook without any sort of malignant thoughts then someone saw it liked it spread it and here we are on reddit. 

Edit: to add kids can get frustrated very easily and give up. They don't understand why their body doesnt do things they want it to do sometimes. A kid will take those shape toys where you put the shapes in their corresponding holes and get very frustrated the first few times trying it and might hate the toy. But if you take their hand and help them do it then make a big deal they'll love it. They'll try again, fail, you'll help, and eventually they can do it on their own"

So many people would comment on the fact I was going bald. Didn't hurt my feelings per se but I got tired of hearing about it but I decided to just to get rid of it all. Best. Decision. Ever. Sure you can tell I did it cause I was going bald but no one will even bother mentioning it. It's like they could tell I sas fighting to accept the fact it was thinning by combing it so they'd poke fun at me. Once I accepted it noone ever mentioned it again.  And before y'all call my friends or former co workers ass holes, they absolutely knew they could joke with me about my balding head. Cause I'd poke fun at them for random things too and none of us were sensitive about it. It was all in good fun.

PlayTemtem,ff785sv,t1_ff6849q,1579643010.0,"Sure man I feel you , you always hear the same complaints about the amount of pokemon.  Personally I haven't played a pokemon game in so long I dont even notice that. Plenty of mons for me. My problem with the games are they are completely stuck in the past. Graphics are terrible  . Being online creates a massive frame rate drop. The entire design of the game is lazy to me. It doesn't feel like a game from a franchise that's brought billions of dollars in. I understand not all those billions come from the games alone but they always sell millions of copies. Sooo many things about this game just feel like it's some indie game made by a a brand new company.  Trying to play online with people is the absolute worst experience there is. The fact I can't just easily trade with my friends without setting a code is ridiculous for this day in age. The animations are just absolutely lazy. I get that alot of the low effort things in the game could be attributed to it being a game on a hand held console back in the day and like for example the crappy amount of npc variation is just ""part of pokemon games"" but jesus come on. It's time for the pokemon games to get out of the past."

LifeProTips,ff51j26,t1_ff4us64,1579577714.0,"It's crazy how many people think that being ass holes will get them discounts or better service. I always just tried to hurry and get those people out of the store as fast as possible, but I would never go over and above for them. Just do exactly what I was being paid to do. However I did see a LOT of guys, specially before I became management (they try not to do these things in front of management ) , that would walk to the back crazy slow, stand there looking at the parts,  and in some cases just not even look and say sorry inventory is off.. if you were an ass hole to them. The auto part equivalent of spitting in your food"
IDontWorkHereLady,ff4to2w,t1_ff4nmjl,1579572184.0,Awesome thanks !
LifeProTips,ff4tldn,t1_ff4mu7k,1579572133.0,"In the big chains there is always a report the store manager reviews the next day for discounts issued, shows the amount and who did it. All the info on the discount really. Some stores have more leeway based on upper management.  Since too many discounts lower your profit and affect your big bosses bonus , you'll rarely want to risk getting talked to by your boss for saving a stranger a couple bucks. However alot of managers understand that a certain level of discounts can be a good thing and can help create returning customers. When I was a manager I never gave my guys a hard time in discounts as long as we were hitting all of our targets . If the store was already suffering then discounts are scrutinized more just like any other metric in the store.  Best way around it was using the excuse of price match. In fact if I had stellar customers I would go out of my way to find a cheaper price online and match it for them. My point before I keep rambling is, nice people get discounts when an employee feels they can do it without jeopardizing their job.  However ass holes are a thousand times less likely to get one unless they cause some kind of scene and someone over you overrides it."

LifeProTips,ff4hyvr,t3_erix4f,1579564060.0,Most every auto part store I've worked at does something similar.  If it ends in 0 or 5. Like 9.95 it's an item that's discounted because they will likely stop carrying it. They do this alot when swapping brands or when they're about to remove seasonal products. Also the price usually drops weekly. Something that was 19.99 will drop to say 17.95 then 12.95 then 9.95. Eventually it will drop to 0.05 but usually the product is long gone by then or hiding somewhere in the back so the employees can buy it when it gets to that point. Most stores are also given the go ahead to give out discounts on said items so unlike most of the time don't feel bad about asking for a discount on them. They usually just want to get rid of them to free up space

musictheory,fejtcyi,t1_fejrx0a,1579185371.0,Ah ok. Isnt that why some guitarists tune their guitar to the middle notes of the neck if they're going to record a solo in the studio? Then tune based off the open notes if they're playing something in that range for rhythm or whatnot.
