There's no reason whatsoever for any communication with the enemy team other than shit talk(which is beyond childish).

Also, I don't understand why teammates sometimes start flaming their own team to the enemy team(this jungler... ; my team... ; this x is so bad).
As if they're apologizing to the enemy team and saying that they're playing on our team just because the circumstances placed them here and would usually play for them.

Honestly, LoL really is a team game but more in the sense that you should have at least 1 friend to play with rather than play with all randoms."
