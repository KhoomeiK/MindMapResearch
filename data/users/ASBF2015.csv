Something  along the lines of “[employee] was previously employed at [company] from [date] to [date]...” include title, maybe a few duties, maybe a little blurb about the company, but nothing too detailed. If your company has a lawyer you work with, they could probably draft you a standard template to use going forward (if needed).


Depending on how you feel about her performance solely based on your professional opinion, not personal, I don’t think it’d be unreasonable to include a sentence stating that the employment was terminated. No employer wants employees like that."

However, what’s to stop you from making an “unofficial” club or society? If you have a space to meet, on campus or off, you could always create exactly what you want. It already sounds like you’re good at getting the word out. Even if it is not recognized at first, doesn’t mean it has to stay that way.

AmItheAsshole,ffc2z8n,t3_esrtrc,1579790252.0,"Yes, YTA. I bet there will be a lot of people placing blame on the “quitter” because of his reaction. You’ve made it clear in your post that you also see it as a somewhat reasonable reaction. I see myself as a professional, polite, extremely ethical, hardworking, and reasonable person, however I have been let go by two jobs for reasons that did not accurately depict the true circumstances and therefore my reaction to the news was anything but poised and professional. I don’t fly off the handle, but I understand your subordinate’s reaction to act as if it’s your loss, not his. 


It sounds like he was blindsided, so did you give him any warnings prior to terminating him? If not, then you’re doubly the asshole. Not giving an employee the information needed to improve an unsatisfactory performance level and just firing them is a crap thing to do. Not saying you did, don’t know. Just my 2¢. 


If I were you, I’d give him his severance. If he is able to or does file for unemployment, I would also not fight it on the employer side. This guy’s pride is already bruised, just be a good guy and make it a little easier on him while he hopefully doesn’t struggle to find more work.

i’m a 19 year old student, i don’t have a lot of debt, but i can’t be throwing my money around like i’m rich. i have a cousin (26) her wedding is on sunday, we’re not really close, but we do have an okay relationship.


she made an announcement this week saying that she’ll be charging 50 dollars for every guest who’s coming. she said that they can venmo her the money so there won’t be no problems and everyone who paid will be added onto the “exclusive guest list” which basically means you won’t have to wait in line while other guests pay.


once i read this, i was shocked. i responded asking why and she said she wanted to get the money she spent on her special day back. i told her i wouldn’t be able to come because this was outrageous and that i wish her well on her special day. she contacted my aunt and my aunt called me cheap and rude. my parents offered to pay for my entry, but i refused.

Your mother probably told him you were gay two years ago and he has been waiting for you to come out to him before bringing it up. The first step in getting closer with your dad is to push yourself to be more open with him. It will be weird at first, but eventually you may end up feeling much closer to him. It sounds like he just wants to be closer to you and is receptive to whoever you are so give it a shot. He may not know how to bring you two closer either, you’ll have to work on it together.


 Maybe a convo explaining that because he’s away, you feel it impacts your closeness, but you’d actually like to be closer. He clearly loves you. You’re his son no matter what. Tell yourself he’s your BFF and it’s not awkward.

AmItheAsshole,femeirq,t3_epxtlb,1579251351.0,"NTA. Although, I think there are better ways to solve your problem. First, I would go to HR or his supervisor and discuss his training methods. Ask if it is possible to have the other trainers you’ve worked with already to continue to supervise you. I understand not wanting to start work and immediately start stirring the pot, I’m usually pretty meek and quiet when I start a job, but that doesn’t mean letting people push you around. You’re new so you still feel like an outsider and not part not the team, but don’t let this guy bully you into quitting. Also, he’s not going to be the last asshole you come across at work. If you absolutely have to work with him again, when he starts shouting, say something to him. Stay as calm as you can and let him know his shouting is not helping you. You learn better with a calmer approach. 


When you speak to him or his supervisor (I’d get this message to the supervisor) make sure to let them know that this does not reflect your ability to work while problem passengers are on board. You’re still trying to learn the ropes and will be much more confident in yourself when fully trained.

Of those women know they’re getting together to pick the dress. Planning a wedding is stressful. A bride doesn’t have time to go over bridesmaids dresses repeatedly or try to get a large group of women with busy schedules together again and again. Joy wouldn’t have been happy until Joy got to pick the dress, but news to Joy: it’s not about her or what she wants. If Joy was a good friend she would have been less self-absorbed and more about honoring OP and her wedding. OP did her part, she tried to be accommodating. If she were another bride, she would have said “this is the dress you’ll be wearing. Don’t like it? Don’t be a bridesmaid.”"

 If Joy wanted to be a part of the bridal party, she should’ve sucked it up. It’s not Joy’s wedding.

It honestly makes me feel like the producers and execs take the public as fools for subscribing to it. There comes a certain point where the bad outweighs the good and they need to go. I started watching for the lifestyle porn, the added negative drama takes away from the show for me. I think the directors/producers (whoever) push the fighting too hard.


Edit: I like some good drama but I don’t want to constantly see grown women acting like children or out of control every time they’re on screen. They cause problems out of nothing for more screen time and it is old and redundant. I’d rather see fancy vacations and where they have fun and do amazing activities and get along rather than screaming at each other the whole time. Or fun parties that actually go smoothly. Making every moment a screaming match honestly ruins it. I get that these women have been put into a group and told to be “friends” and may not actually get along so tensions are high when they are all together, but every once in a while it’s like “ladies, suck it up and keep it together.

Your tourist visa was likely approved because they’re not looking into your marriage history, just to make sure you haven’t entered illegally or done anything illegal while in the US. That will **not** be the case with this green card case. They will see the annulment decree and will question it. Your lawyer will navigate this with you and respond appropriately. Be prepared for a battle because if there is anything USCIS hates, marrying for a green card is at the top of the list. Hopefully, your lawyer is able to rightfully explain that that is not what happened and that your exwife is a liar and by the fact you left the US when you split proves you weren’t just after a GC.

It sucks that this is just making her angry at you and isn’t really going to teach your daughter anything, because you are absolutely right and I wish there was a good way to make her understand how dangerous it is without a fatal accident being involved. Not sure I would have revoked her license, but without your exwife’s support, what other options are there really? 


When I had just graduated college and was back living at home, I was driving my dad’s car to the gym. There was **no one** on this town road with me, when my phone rang, I looked over at it for one second, when I looked back up, there was a national grid truck basically stopped just a few feet from me. Well, I hit it. To this day, I have absolutely no idea where it came from. The driver was super nice about it, probably because she cut me off, but I couldn’t prove anything because I hadn’t seen where she came from. It had me so shaken. The truck was totally fine, itty bitty scratch, but my dad’s entire front end was crushed. Thank god that’s all that happened. I learned my lesson the hard way and have never been so careless again.


Your exwife is supporting your daughter’s stupidity because your exwife is being just as stupid. It’s unfortunate. You may have gone to extreme measures, but it’s better than one of them learning the hard way and chances are it’ll be your daughter because she’s so inexperienced at driving. 


You should compile videos of accidents, survivor stories, and loved ones losses for *both* of them to watch. I can’t believe your exwife is being so flippant about this, it’s actually very serious. If your daughter was on her phone long enough for a cop to catch her, she was definitely on it long enough to cause a serious accident."

You or your fiancé (I’d suggest you so you know what is said) should also have a talk with Dan to let him know that all three girls will be a part of the bridal party. From there, it’s up to them. You’re all adults and awkward tension happens when you have casual hookups, but hopefully they can be mature enough to put it on the back burner to be present on your big day.

harrypotter,fdmv3gg,t1_fdldz79,1578567210.0,"Thank you so much! Bottom right seems to be the crowd fav (mine too)! I’d always be willing to take a request. Setting up a shop is a great idea! I’ll have to get on my grind and pop out a few more first. All these paintings are 16”x20” acrylic on canvas, except the center left (7.5”x13.5”)"

harrypotter,fdl945q,t1_fdjwe4j,1578519138.0,I would be happy to! Send me a message if you’re interested.
harrypotter,fdl7ek1,t1_fdl5727,1578518309.0,Thank you! I’d be happy to sell them! Always love sharing with another HP fan.

harrypotter,fdl46y0,t1_fdjsoz8,1578516756.0,Yes! That’s how I got on this kick. I’m an HP lover and my BFF is a big fan. She also loves Starry Night so I made the bottom left for her bday.
AmItheAsshole,fdjqdoa,t1_fdii4p4,1578483411.0,"I think it’s more insecurity than fantasy. She’s assuming strippers will be at the Bach party and wants to be on party patrol to monitor her fiancé’s behavior. Plus, she gets the added validation of his friends seeing her in a sexy way, but I don’t think it’s a fetish or anything."
JUSTNOMIL,fdjn87q,t3_elmnwv,1578479108.0,"From your flair, yes. I’d try to just let it go. It’s probably not a competition (it may only seem like it to you), MIL is likely excited to be around her grandchild. If she really only sees him once every few months, why not just let her care for him (within reason)? If you just loosen up on the control of “he’s *MY* baby”, I think the tension you’re feeling will subside. Everyone knows you’re his mom, he’s not going to love anyone else like you, and someone else comforting him or caring for him for a little bit is never going to change that. 


As far as the diaper issue, I’d just let her know diapers are expensive and if he doesn’t absolutely need it, don’t do it. It’s ok to set ground rules, no need to feel guilty. 


I’d suggest taking a step back and reflecting on the situation. Try to change your perspective. Obviously, there are boundaries, but everyone is aware that he is *your* child and having family and in-laws that want to love on and care for your baby is a good problem to have."

Loved it! She is so hilarious."
AmItheAsshole,fdg20v5,t1_fdg0m5j,1578377106.0,"I always get stuck on this detail too. OP can be talking about getting mugged, purse stolen (actual Reddit post), and commenters still assume male. Which most people would be like NBD, but gender can definitely affect the narrative a lot of the time (and commenters’ sympathy levels)."
BravoRealHousewives,fdekp8x,t3_ek4cmu,1578341077.0,"LeeAnne made a few appearances on Dallas Divas and Daughters. It’s basically pre-RH’s. Personally, I think Pam from that show would make a **great** Dallas housewife."

relationship_advice,fddcgrb,t3_eklljy,1578305570.0,"No, no, no, girl! Please have some self respect! Know your worth. Don’t be naive to his sweetness now. Love has a way of clouding our judgment, but he abandoned you in your darkest hour and time of need. Please understand that you deserve so much more. This man is good when you are good, but leaves you when you aren’t? I truly hope you are smart enough to stay away and not let him back in. You will find better. A relationship is full of ups and downs, it can’t work if your partner is only there for the ups."
OccultConspiracy,fddb2s2,t1_fdd18w5,1578303453.0,"But still so dumb. Basically, every famous person is an alien or reptilian? Hoookay 🙄 


Like Miley Cyrus? Please... pshh"
Fencesitter,fdd9711,t3_ekq9a5,1578300648.0,"Yes, you should definitely worry. This is a major compatibility issue in a relationship. You could love him with every ounce of your being, but if you want kids and he doesn’t, it can’t work. Kids are very stressful. If someone isn’t fully onboard, it should be an absolute no-go. It **will** cause resentment, arguments, and eventually may break the relationship."
Vent,fd9b20j,t3_ek8n1w,1578230985.0,"People get that saying all wrong anyway. It’s actually the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Meaning the bond between soldiers, war bothers, etc. is so much stronger than family ties and genetics."
AmItheAsshole,fd5zpl5,t1_fd4zd03,1578183542.0," It’s really unfortunate when someone wasn’t super famous when a baby with the same name was born but by the time the kid is in school said famous person’s career has exploded.


I went to high school with a Pam Anderson that happened to be brunette, wore thick glasses, 5’8”, and about 260lbs... needless to say, it did not go unnoticed."
PublicFreakout,fd4mixx,t1_fd2eli9,1578168910.0,"People don’t work while in school? Especially, part time jobs that allow for class time? Have loans? Scholarships?

aww,fcyrccy,t1_fcyllgy,1578085462.0,Lol. Why did I have to confirm I was over 18 to see that? Had me worried for a sec.
AmItheAsshole,fcxdgo9,t1_fcw350c,1578059976.0,Seriously. It just makes it look like the parents didn’t know that “x” already makes a “z” sound. So redundant.
AmItheAsshole,fcx7pde,t3_ejeng2,1578054576.0,"NTA. She sounds mentally unstable. Hopefully your brother realizes sooner rather than later that she is going to ostracize him from his family. Her behavior sounds beyond childish, screaming and throwing a fit in public like that is unacceptable. This chick needs help and some serious self reflection before she’ll be ready for a serious relationship."

immigration,fctvfax,t1_fcrhil2,1577961547.0,"I’m sorry you were treated this way. So what exactly was the issue? Was the company you worked at for 2 months not updated in your I-20? 


You’re still employed, correct? Does your HR have an immigration specialist or an immigration attorney they work with? Definitely contact them right away."

Similar, I love Married to Medicine, but in seven seasons the ladies have never all gotten together without at least one screaming match. Ever. I noticed in season four and nothing has changed. It’s like, come on, seriously? You grown women can’t be mature enough to have a civil disagreement without throwing fits and screaming?"

You have the means to have other food and you eat your child’s beloved pet that you also killed? You’re a selfish asshole, sorry."
