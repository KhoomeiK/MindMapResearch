False. Also easily solved by examine text.

>dumb after some time

False at least to me. This will be an epic race and achievement remembered for a long time much like first inferno clear or lowest inferno is actually a better comparison.

TheSilphRoad,fdk2bb5,t1_fdk1zti,1578494318.0,I've heard of this happen. Some showoff threw all but one ball on the ground to flex and then the boss blocked the last ball. So satisfying!

TheSilphRoad,fd4mht6,t3_ejtkiu,1578168899.0,Why do you guys play it if you hate it so much? Yes it has bugs. They have always been there and I'm used to them. I exploit quick catch daily and would be heartbroken if it was fixed. Of course there are multiple QoL updates to be made and there really is no excuse for buggy updates but I still am very much in love with the game.
