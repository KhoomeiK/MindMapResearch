You do know what it means to be a Kung Fu Master.  There are only so many over all of time.  

In order to earn that title, one must gain the respect of all of the other schools.  

And not for nothing, this one guy taught Bruce Lee!

Bruce Lee has been accepted in modern science as a super human.  And this guy taught him how to do Kung Fu?

If you want to do the research.  A lot of it is defendable.  

There even is real documentaries.  And film clips about Master Ip.  There are pictures of his wife.

I am still at the most entry level stage of this school after studying for a decade.

Kung Fu strength is different than sport strength.  

 \- 1 It's all about core

 \-2 It's all day, all night.  No beginning and ending.

I could go do a 3 mile open water swim.  At the end.  I come home and crumble in a mess.  

There is this guy who I look up to in my school.  And I get to spend time with him through volunteer work.  I could show up at 6 am.  And work with him non-stop until 2 am.  And the next day when I get up at 6 am.  He is already there dressed and acting like he had 3 cups of coffee.  For volunteer work!!  That dude has true Kung Fu.

He is like half the size of me.

I'm big, 6'1 220 lbs and propper.  So they use me for security.  I look the part.  But just because I have genetics.  I've got nothing on any one of them.

My wife is 5'3''  the is the love of my life.  And she is gorgeous.  I watch her when she sleeps. 

But her Kung Fu is stronger than mine.  And she gets angry.  She might be able to punch my lights out.  I'm ducking, weaving, and blocking like crazy.  And when she lands a punch.  It freaking hurts.  And usually takes out something I need, like an eye.

Skip the gym.

Run stairs.

Go take a few Kung Fu classes at a local place and learn.  

And did you know that Bruce Lee wrote a book.  He liked Kung Fu.

Keep meditating, study, go to some classes, practice your forms, and study.

I've studied Kung Fu in New York, Los Angeles, and Taiwan.  

Back in 1990, I knocked on the Shaolin temple door and asked to be a student.  They told me no.

Last year, my Teacher told me that our school has a promise to protect them.  And we have to continue that promise.  He was like, 'Oh by the way, do not forget that our school is required to protect the Monks of the Shaolin'.

taoism,ffxo95v,t3_evrokw,1580329155.0,"In China, about 3,000 years ago.  The people felt they were being treated unfairly.  So they went to the Masters of Kung Fu and asked for a solution.

The Masters got together and came up with a solution.

They would create one school.  

They would go to every other Kung Fu school and ask for the youngest most promising student.  

That student would be trained by all of the Masters of Kung Fu.

Then, that student would be sent to live in a random town.  And if anyone ever found out they knew Kung Fu.  They would have to leave that town and go to another town.  Just to hid their identity.

They were required to train in the middle of the night.

There is the other part.  It's part of history.

The first Chinese battalion would show up and never be heard of.  

No sign of any weapons.  No footprints.  Horses well fed.  Everybody was dead.  

So the Chinese Government was like it's you, the Japanese!  Only Ninja can do this!

Japanese was like, NO!!  It is not us!  

So the Chinese Government hired the Japanese Ninjas to wipe out the invisible warriors.

And only a few survived.   

Those people carried on a tradition, a few books.  And some teachings.

That is the story, a few farmers facing the Chinese and the Japanese military."

You need oxygen and you need rest.  Take in as much O2 in your back.  That is fine.  But you need more O2 in that breast stroke.  In the IMs  butterfly is all about survival.  For everyone.  Even at the college level.  But you have to develop technique.

An IMer's breast stroke is different from a breast stroker.  It is a way longer way more efficient stroke.  The breast stroker will get in and just splash splash splash and get out.  

An IMer that's the middle.

Start talking it out.  I went through about 6 therapists.  Now I just meditate.  Now it's just a work out.  Or a run.  And some meditation.  Make sure I eat healthy.  That's it.

That is where you are going to be.  A positive body image.  A positive outlook on life.  Optimistic about the future.

You aren't going to change.  You are just going to learn how to be crazy and be good at it.

I'm no longer depressed.  I'm not dangerous to myself or anyone else.

Not everyone will be able to understand or appreciate you and you will not care.  

Give it just a few months.  Go to the meeting. 

One pro tip.  I chose a sexy therapist.  When someone who looks like a potato is telling you to have a positive outlook.  You are like.  All that goes through your mind is how many bags of Cheetos do they eat in a week.  

But if it is someone that is sexy telling you to be proud of yourself, you are like, 'Hmmmm, I think I should listen to this sexy person.'

Maybe it's me.  But I will not listen to even a medical doctor unless they are a sexy female.  

They don't have to be young.  Just sexy.  It's not a pervy thing.  It was just something I discovered about myself.  

Other people go for people that look like their teachers or their mothers.

If an old fat dude doctor told me to lose weight.  I would be like whatever.  But when my super sexy doctor that looks like she just did a runway show.  

I starved myself for a month to lose 20 lbs.  

The other thing is getting defensive.  That was the first thing I figured out.

I'm a big guy.  And when a guy starts telling me what to do.  I turn into Randy Marsh at a Hockey game.

Listen.  Kung Fu takes years of dedication.  Decades of training with someone who knows it.  And if you are lucky, a Master.

You learned wrestling in what, high school?  Beat up a bunch of kids in the school yard and now you think you are an expert on Kung Fu?

Shut your freaking mouth.  My wife could beat you up.

Just stop talking like you know everything.  You are a kid, you are a punk.

I'm not going to play the game.  I don't care about your opinion.  It doesn't matter.

Do you want to know what a fun trick is.  Dodge a few punches and get them to smile.  That big sh\*t eating grin.  They think they are winning.  The chin is out.  

Once they are smiling. The next hit usually wraps up the whole game.  I mean blood everywhere, and usually they are just falling.

There is no point in hitting a guy like that in the noggin.  You can't make them any dumber.

You can not leave your equipment in the car because the bindings could freeze.  And when you go to use them, they might be fragile.

So as a skier, you sleep with your equipment.  

But there are places that have strict rules and post signs, ''DO NOT BRING YOUR SKIS INSIDE THE INN!!""  But that is like at the hostels in Switzerland and everyone is on rented gear anyway.  And you can't actually get to or from the town without skis.

Meditation,ffrq53l,t3_euu8xy,1580163343.0,"No!!!!

Never!

Let's talk through these scenarios.  Both I have been a part of.

You are going to meet the ex-boyfriend of your current girlfriend.

Scenario #1

He threatens your manhood.   He threatens your dominance.  You must assert dominance and show him that you are the victor.  So, you do your push ups.  Beef up.  Dress in clothes that show how strong you are.  And when you meet him you give that dude crazy eyes.

That dude sees you and is like.  Oh my gosh this guy will crush me.  And I will never see it coming.  If I crack this beer bottle over his skull and make a run for it.  At least I have a chance.

Then the beer bottle.

Scenario #2

Oh My Gosh!!!   You are the person who was so kind to the person I love for so long.  I want to thank you for that and extend forever hospitality.  I am so sorry it didn't work out, it sounds like both of you had valid reasons.  She told me everything.  

But you liked this person.  I like this person.  We have that in common.  I like the fact that you were so nice to my girl friend for so long.  Let me buy you a beer.

So the second scenario is a a situation where someone prepared for the scenario by finding ways to be kind and thankful.  Not confrontational.

Of course now you say, duh of course.  You are always going to say that you are a Taoist.  

And that is kind of the point.

Prepare your mind to bring kindness, gentleness, and generosity to any oppositional table.  

The Taoist secret to winning is to fill your heart with love and kindness.  I'm not kidding.  3,000 year old Kung Fu secret and now you have it.  The secret has always been love and kindness.  

And the reason why is if they punch you.  And you love them.  You say, I am sorry I offended you.  It's easy to take a punch from someone you love.  That is physiology.  It has to do with how the body tenses up.  Another 3,000 year old trade secret of the Tao."
