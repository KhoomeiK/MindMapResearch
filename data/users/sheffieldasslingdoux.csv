MapPorn,feh9hob,t1_feh6niv,1579111935.0,The problem is that independent commissions sometimes do that. If they have to make districts competitive then they will pack minorities into a district or effectively gerrymander the map to force a “competitive” race. Independent commissions are a great stop gap. But ending our current single district system is the ultimate solution.
MapPorn,feh92z1,t1_feh69ne,1579111685.0,"Gerrymandering is when one political party draws electoral districts in a way that advantages them. The consequence of Gerrymandering is that a party can receive a minority of the vote but get the majority of representatives. There are several ways to gerrymander, and it can be quite complicated since you can use computers to draw the districts. The most common method is to pack similar people into few districts, so they’re not represented proportionally to their population. 

The US Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional, but not partisan gerrymandering. In other words, it’s illegal to put all the black people in one district preventing them from getting more than one representative. But you are allowed to pack all the Democrats or Republicans into a district. 

Context: every 10 years the US conducts a census and redraws congressional districts. States with bigger populations get more districts (ie more reps in the House). Whichever party is in power in each state was traditionally in charge of drawing the congressional maps. Obvious conflict of interest right? So, several states now have independent commissions that draw the maps. 

One thing to note here. Gerrymandering is a consequence of our single member districts. So you can’t “end gerrymandering” under the current system. It’s impossible. And there’s a whole debate of what criteria districts should be drawn on: competitiveness, fairness, etc. 

Etymology: Gerrymandering is named after Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry. In 1812, a district in Boston was drawn which resembled a salamander."

The last time the United States officially declared war was 1942. Every president in recent memory has ordered covert military action without congressional authorization. This is the average person's idea of astute political commentary. Trump stacked his cabinet with neocons itching for war with Iran. Bolton and Pompeo have never seen a war they didn't like. While Trump not informing Congress is newsworthy, it's also expected.

Obama directed the military to aid Saudi Arabia in their proxy war in Yemen. Congress only woke up to this conflict when Trump assumed office. You will see many politicians wag their fingers at Trump. They may even write a sternly worded letter. But remember, almost all of them voted for the most recent NDAA and the reauthorization of the AUMF, allowing Trump to carry out this action in the first place.
