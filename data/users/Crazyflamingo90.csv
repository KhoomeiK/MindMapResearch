awfuleverything,fewmvgg,t1_fewjwu0,1579415097.0,Fake baby dont worry and not meant to be funny meant to be awful. Hence why I put it here.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fevu872,t3_eomli4,1579401568.0,This is terrible I hope they spend a long time in prison for this.
iamatotalpieceofshit,feuxki8,t1_fen6vmi,1579390973.0,To be fair the USA is one of the only 1st world countries that doesn't allow prostitution.
iamatotalpieceofshit,feuwaqt,t1_feq4rby,1579390561.0,I hope that he meant ok doomer as a joke but I feel like it's misplaced hope.
spicy,feudcr9,t1_feuc9h3,1579385481.0,Not here to argue just wanted to say if it's too hot even if you can handle the heat it over powers other flavors. Like an onion if you put too much onion on a burger you will only taste onion. Just wanted to state my opinion. I respect that you have your own preference.
spicy,feu70tr,t1_feu5h48,1579383763.0,"I agree, but what I'm saying is, for example I like habaneros but if I put 16 in a bowl of chili I'm not gonna taste the chili only the habaneros regardless whether it's unbearably hot or not it will over power the flavor of what you're eating if you go nuts."
gatekeeping,feu66nz,t1_fetyoc5,1579383474.0,"I I wouldn't brag about being emo anyways. ""Wow this person is depressed, that's cool I want to be just like them now."" If you are genuinely depressed I promise I'm not trying to takea shot at you just people who fake it for the attention."
spicy,fetxbsz,t1_fenmx4l,1579381024.0,Your story reminds me of the time I ate some super hot wings and when they made their way out it was so hot my asshole felt cold from the shock of the heat lmao. They were good wings though.
SmashBrosUltimate,fem8tuq,t3_epvgtm,1579243993.0,"Time to suck it up, it happened and now it's done. Show sakurai some respect"
AskReddit,felfglx,t1_fel8g92,1579220924.0,"I agree, they are disgusting. But I have to say blueberries are horrible. To me blueberries tastes like dirt."
news,fehiu01,t1_fehcmmq,1579117421.0,"Only the politicians, I'm from gulfport and most white people myself included treat black people the same way they would like to be treated. Now central Mississippi is racist as fuck, or it was in the early 90's anyways."
ScarySigns,fegq24t,t3_ep0utr,1579099843.0,We have a bridge here where I live and you wouldnt believe the number of box trucks and RV's that hit. A local moving company even has in their contract that you cant take their truck fon that road and people still do
AskReddit,feeqmmo,t3_eojqln,1579039141.0,If I'm innocent and not lying I would go with sherlock Holmes (modern tv series on from elementary) or the guy from lie to me.
killthosewhodisagree,fecvb50,t3_ekk179,1578986046.0,That is the ramblings of a person blinded by misplaced loyalty and I wouldnt call either. They would let me die. I'm not rich after all.
AskReddit,fecucck,t3_eohb6f,1578984944.0,Carbon steel with a diamond coated edge I would think. Laser sharpened before diamond coating. That might do it but I'm no blade expert.
AskReddit,fecu4vw,t3_eohbap,1578984713.0,If it's a group I enjoy you should most likely be ready fo a friendly debate.
AskReddit,fecscmo,t3_eohbcn,1578982763.0,Not really because of age so much as having a family now but travelling. I wish I had seen more states before i settled down but couldn't be happier with my husband and son.
AskReddit,fecs6hd,t3_eohbna,1578982579.0,"It's also a saying, but my 4th grade teacher used to tell us at the end of every week, ""good, better, best, good to your better and better to your best."" Then would go on to explain that it means that you should never stop trying to be better. Its helped me alot over the years."
AskReddit,fecrpq6,t1_febzlcy,1578982090.0,I believe that nearly anyone has been masturbated to at some point. Everyone is attractive to someone.
gaming,fe6oq51,t1_fe6onan,1578898466.0,"That I completely agree with, if you're not going to make an effort to help your team then they should play a solo mode like free for all."
gaming,fe6oj8h,t1_fe6obtx,1578898235.0,There's plenty of decent western gamers. Japanese may be more polite in some ways but most Americans are generally speaking polite people. And as far as being drunk or high while playing it all depends on the player as to how they react to each one.
gaming,fe6ntl5,t1_fe6niy9,1578897413.0,"No because they are different. Rude simply implies that your not very tactful with your word choice and tone. Toxic behavior is like being rude on steroids. That's why I say toxic, it's not slang it's the correct term."
gaming,fe6nla8,t1_fe6nbse,1578897158.0,"It's a game if you take it so seriously that you feel the need to belittle others when you don't win, you my friend are a problem. People like you are what make modern gaming seem so bad to so many people. You contribute to a toxic community. You are probably trolling but if not I sincerely hope you at least try to analyze what I'm saying and apply the implied advice."
gaming,fe6n8x3,t1_fe6n4ur,1578896785.0,"No, because what you call playing like shit could be their best and they are trying to get better. Your response to my comment implies that you lean towards being toxic."
gaming,fe6mwkq,t1_fe6fyyf,1578896413.0,It's a sincere sentiment. If you have lived your life being toxic and you want to change it's not going to happen over night it's a habit like any other behavior it takes time and conscious effort like this to over come.
SmashBrosUltimate,fe454jy,t1_fdysa3g,1578855877.0,Would simon and Richter count?

creepyPMs,fdu2se2,t1_fdu1vm2,1578726509.0,Just to be clear I wasn't abusive to women or men or anything I just always struggled to be faithful and caring if I felt I wasn't getting enough sexual attention. Still don't understand what made me that way but I am glad I overcame it.
creepyPMs,fdu0r73,t1_fdtynww,1578725460.0,"I sincerely hope that this person isn't stuck in such a dark situation. If they are I pray that they find all the help they need. I used to be sex obsessed and then I found my husband and I learned how to be better, how to appreciate things outside of the sexual nature such as his personality and interests. I hope this person has a similar experience before it is too late."
creepyPMs,fdtj0iq,t1_fdtenvm,1578717453.0,"You're right, I hope he gets some kind of help because I can only imagine that there is something wrong in his mind if he's being genuine. That is still no excuse for that kind of behavior. I like trying to understand people like this."
creepyPMs,fdt2qz5,t1_fdqwt23,1578711158.0,"You are entirely correct, but as for everyone else maybe it's not so much racist as it is disrespect. He himself could be a black man and doesn't respect women and calls certain ones hood rats. Or he could be totally racist and I'm completely off base."
Jokes,fdsel9b,t3_emub1w,1578700921.0,"New telling of an old joke, all the same good."
UnethicalLifeProTips,fdnnusj,t1_fdm93nh,1578589651.0,Can anyone else hear the youtube video then? Because I hear it perfectly.
HumansAreMetal,fdkjjqo,t1_fdkgk2e,1578505023.0,"No problem, auto correct can be a pain in the ass at times."
politics,fdke43p,t1_fdj05yo,1578501931.0,We have that stigma only because the government speaks on our behalf when it comes to other governments without consulting us or even referring to polls to show how against war we really are. And it doesn't help that the people who are for war seem to scream much louder than the ones who don't want war so they seem like the majority. I'm antiwar and anti conflict in general so I don't go about screaming like a lunatic about it but this also hurts us because we don't stick out as much as pro war people.
HumansAreMetal,fdkbfl3,t3_ejqzii,1578500324.0,"You mean to say ""tis but a flesh wound"". I'm sure it was just auto correct messing with ya, just felt I should quote the awesome movie properly lol."
Cricket,fdinjlt,t1_fdif30x,1578446880.0,"That helps some, thank you. Sorry I had to ask, here in America cricket isn't played or at least not that I know of"
