I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say.

> If you’re going to argue I should have respect for the man who sits around and signs papers because he creates unlivable wage jobs, then you should also support the notion that those jobs should be livable with benefits, wages, and unions.

1. I'm not telling you to respect anyone.

2. You're engaging in strawman arguments. No where did I mention anything about signing papers or unlivable wages. (And by the way, have you ever defined what unlivable wages mean?) I did mention that there are a certain breed of people that create companies and jobs.

3. Any leader of a company (CEO, president) job is to steer the company and keep it competitive and profitable. They may only make 3-4 decisions in a year but they're far reaching choices like which market segments to pursue, which locations to venture into, etc. You want workers to keep having jobs, someone needs to make decisions that keep the company afloat.

> But as it stands the rich avoid taxes, funnel money and labor overseas, hoard wealth, cause people to face immense hardships, rig our democracy against us, prevent infrastructural growth by lobbying in their outdated interests.

Once again, that's a different topic. I just responded to someone asking why a boss should be making more money than a worker. If you want to talk about this, start another thread.

> They have become leeches and detriments to the very infrastructure that they REQUIRE to earn anything. The workers of this country do not leech and therefore are not a problem. 

There are a lot of leeches to the infrastructure like the homeless, illegal immigrants, the elderly, college students, etc. From a wear-and-tear perspective, they're far more destructive to infrastructure than the comparatively handful of CEOs and presidents.

We'd get far more money to pay for infrastructure just by taxing these types of people.

> We must do everything in our power to save America from its biggest threat, and that’s the rich and elite.

Right, let's get rid of all the rich and the elite. Who's going to create jobs again?

Can you point to any country that has survived over 50 years without the rich or the elite?"
facepalm,fd5zlxk,t1_fd5objs,1578183506.0,"> Those 0.25%, however, would not have made it anywhere if it weren't for the infrastructure of our country.

And workers would die without the infrastructure of our country. The stability of our economy and common services (e.g. law enforcement, fire sanitation) benefits everyone.

> They would die in their current year if it weren't for their laborers.

And workers would die in their current year without jobs. Who do you think creates jobs?

> Ignoring that the primary problem is with those born into wealth, who never have to work a day in their lives, and focusing on those who actually earn their wealth: These people generally are more in touch with the world if they weren't born into wealth.

If someone inherits a company and doesn't know how to run it properly, chances are the company will fail. Then another competitor will rise up.

> But the fact remains that they would have earned $0 if it weren't for our workers.

Workers need jobs to pay their expenses. Businesses need workers to run the business. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement. Unless someone puts a gun to their head, workers are free to take and leave jobs as they see fit.

> So it is only fair that they pay a proportionate amount of taxes while they sit on their yacht doing nothing.

No one said they're not paying taxes. If you want to spin this off into why businesses need to pay more taxes, feel free to start a separate thread.

> It's the least they can do after our taxes gave them their wealth.

No one in the history of capitalism ever got wealthy through taxes. Taxes take money from citizens and businesses in order to create a stable platform to live their lives. This benefits everyone. For some, it allows them to start businesses. For others, it allows them to raise a family.

> And they should also be paying workers fair, livable wages with benefits no matter what level the employment is at.

That's a highly subjective standard. What exactly is livable wages? iPhone 17 in every pocket? AMG in every garage? If you've got an objective standard, I've love to hear it.

A living wage has been discussed at least back to 1928 and it seems no one has come up with anything concrete.

> So clearly it is vital for the rich man to make his money while sitting on their yacht.

Yes, it is absolutely vital. Because there has to be a big enough incentive for someone to work 80 hour weeks, put their home mortgage as collateral for a business loans, and put their blood, sweat, and tears into starting a business.

For some people, they're OK with just being self-employed. So they might start a mom-and-pop store or work as a consultant. They'll never sit on a yacht but they're alright with that.

The reward has to be proportional to the risk."
facepalm,fd5at80,t1_fd4sbu4,1578175826.0,"> How is it fair that a boss who sits on their yacht earns more than a worker who spends hours on hours doing labor warehouses, just to feed their families. 

Assuming you're talking about the founder of the company, it's fair because when the company was being formed, there was no guarantee it'll make it beyond 2 years.

95% of companies fail in the 1st year and 95% of the remaining companies fail in the 2nd year. That means only 0.25% of companies make it to the 3rd year.

They took the risk of starting the company, putting up their assets, and putting in countless hours to organize and kickstart the company.

For the workers, in case the company goes under, they risk nothing except looking for a new job."

If I recall, Left 4 Dead 2 had something similar.

And on top of that, if you and your team was doing too well, the director would block off passages to make your trek longer."
