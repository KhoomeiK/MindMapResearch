MadeMeSmile,ferme8n,t1_ferkpe8,1579355745.0,He did but it was his choice. Everyone is commenting that he was forced to give them away when he wasn't. The administration came right out and said the rule doesn't apply to him because he's not in a position to give preferential treatment to the students like a teacher would be.
MadeMeSmile,ferjkea,t1_fer7mhh,1579354710.0,He didn't have to. Maybe actually read the article.

AskReddit,fckyk2u,t1_fckq4dd,1577735951.0,">(I’ve done it before)

Why?"
ChoosingBeggars,fciv3xk,t1_fciuoni,1577670537.0,"It's art. There is no real ""normal"" rate. Most I've seen, though, will charge by the hour with a one hour minimum charge."

worldnews,fc79tj5,t3_egk1l6,1577501335.0,The only ad I ever seemed to hear on Spotify the last time I didn't have premium was the Spotify ad telling me to get premium. Doesn't seem like this will change much.
gaming,fc78y2k,t1_fc77klp,1577500666.0,"I mean, there's also a gaming circle jerk subreddit specifically for shitposts like this, which is another reason to downvote."
television,fc6onfu,t1_fc6o5zf,1577485602.0,"> But Geralt is woke as well as large, and does not warm to Streggy’s  toxic masculinity. “Evil is evil,” he informs his potential employer  with an integrity this freelancer can only admire.

dataisbeautiful,fc6lygl,t1_fc6jvyt,1577483707.0,I think you kind of ruined your own experiment by explaining it right off the bat.
