pcgaming,ff84w63,t1_ff76ear,1579666068.0,"Well, the 2v2 format, moves clearly show their priority (There is 3 types of priority), and then the TemTems go in speed order by priority. This is similar to pokemon but IIRC pokemon either had priority moves or normal speed moves.

Some abilities start on cooldown, generally buffs and powerful moves. This is actually a nice change compared to pokemon, because this allows to have truly powerful moves, creating situations where the opponent must kill off that pokemon ASAP before you can use the move.

And yeah, temtems have stamina, abilities cost stamina. You can use an ability while out of stamina but it will cost HP. You can either order your temtem to rest, to regain stam, or swap them out. This part I actually like, because this should stop team wipers, as stam will run out, and they will need to swap out.

Overall, it's early to say, but I am already liking it quite a bit because you kinda have to use your whole team."
pcgaming,ff83mcz,t1_ff6sxiv,1579665097.0,"Well, it's an indie company alright, doing all the critical mistakes many make. From what they're saying on the forums, they didn't expect this amount of people. 5k was a ""top end of their expectations""... for a pokemon MMO **on PC**... Like if you've been on any mmo forums, the search for the quintessential ""MMO like pokemon"" has been a big one, for a long time. There have been maybe two, which just weren't even close.

Having played the game, it's definitely designed for console first, PC second. The menuing, the controls, it's all great on controller, on PC it's kinda meh. 

So I am guessing they gauged the interest with the Switch market where they would go up against Pokemon. For PC though, there have like zero competition. There is World of Final Fantasy, which is alright but has a weird stacking system and that's it."

This is precisely what we were taught in our courses, knowing someone's profile and probabilities associated with it to get the actuarial survival, and then using that with the profit margin you want and on average how much you'll be paying out to know how much you should charge one person. In reality they do this but you're put categorized into groups, law of big numbers and reduce variance and all.

For the consumer, it's purely a risk elimination thing. ""If I die tomorrow what will happen to my wife and kids?"", that's why insurance works. If you were to take all insured people, and instead of paying for insurance they would put it in a saving account, on the average, they would come out ahead, but of course, we're talking about individuals, they don't care about the average.

Now, about 3/4 of the class looked at the entry fee and didn't bother doing the math of ""ooh, so on average for every 1500$ I spend on tickets I get back 2500$"", as most people would rather drop only 5$ on chance than 150$ on change, even though at 5$ at 0.1% means on average you'll lose half your money.

If you're looking for classical grind mmos you got : Runescape, Black Desert Online, Albion Online, Maplestory, Gloria Victis

MMOs with lots of world events: TESO, Guild wars 2, WoW and to a lesser extent FF14 and EVE online

MMOs with ability to solo dungeons: SWTOR, FF14, Guild Wars 1, EVE, Lord of the rings online, Astellia

MMOs with group dungeon: SWTOR, Neverwinter, WOW, FF14, TESO, Albion. The following have group dungeons but either too hard to find a group, unrewarding or both: GW2,GW1,EVE, LOTRO

MMOs with PVP: SWTOR(character and ship PVP), WoW, Guild wars 2 (RvR or Arena style), Eve online, Albion, Gloria Victis, Black desert online, TESO others have PVP as well but mostly abandoned or unplayable. Like GW1 you can still find queues but you'll play against and with bots (like actual bots that people use to farm money).

In term of population; Neverwinter, SWTOR, FF14, WoW, EVE, Blade Desert online, Albion and TESO, in no particular order, you'll always have tons of people playing.

For the most part, they all have their twists, ups and downs, I'll list my personal opinion on the big ones:

TESO: Is one of the top contenders, very immersive, lots of story and lore from quests. There is a lot to do in that game, from the standard grinding dungeons for gear and crafting gear, and crafting is always relevant btw, thanks to upgrading dungeon gear. If you get bored of that, you can go around and pickpocket people, accomplish bounties for guilds, or complete assassination contracts from the dark brotherhood. 

FF14: The staple of the theme park mmo in my opinion. They took what worked from various mmos, instead of reinventing the wheel. FF14 has the most solid end-game grind loop, based around the token/drop model from around WOTLK, do dungeons, get gear and token. It's made so you don't have to waste your life on the game grinding every minute of every day if you want to keep a class with great gear. You do your weekly token allotment, you do your weekly raids, for parts (one you can just pug, extreme requires a premade group and are tough). 

Guild Wars 2: This one is a big sad to talk about. It used to be so great, but then they extended it into this mess.... I mean it's still a decent game. The big fun in that game, for the most part, are world maps, world events and PVP. The arena PVP is pretty balanced, skill based. RvR world PVP is pretty fun but can be mindless if you just zerg. World events are good money and good fun, just show up where you should be based on the schedule, and get rewards. The world map stuff is where they've put their big focus, like every season has seen a new zone, which is basically the same grind.

Guild wars 1: I play this above GW2 in my book, it's still one mmo I play often. It's just good, it's one you'll mostly play solo, but it's basically a mix of MMO and classical RPG where you control a party. You make a party of yourself + 7 heroes, each hero you gear up, and make a skill build, lots of nice combination you can do.

Black Desert Online: This is a tough one. I really like it, but I don't really fight it in anymore. It's weird, BDO is a breathing world, it has the most exciting combat of any MMO in my opinion, but the grinding and leveling gets kinda stale. World bossing is kinda fun, but costly. What often ends up happen is life skilling takes over the warrior's life. You end up spending a lot of time on fishing, or taming and training horses, or cooking and processing, or sailing and bartering and so on. Everything is a skill and a hobby to master. The PVP is really great too, but the grind can get boring.

Notable mention: Gloria Victis it's kind of a weird one, in early access, but making good pace. The crafting/gathering is very similar to Runescape, you go to one spot, grind resource, wait for respawn, then craft. It's a third person medieval combat game, very much like mordhau and chivalry (maybe not as clutch, since it's a MMO). But it's fun, there is some grind to leveling and making money, gotta kill npcs in the world for exp and money, but there is constant fighting, there's a map and you can constantly attack and defend against other factions."

Likewise, what I said is only true because the amount of vegan attempts is so low, it swings the statistical probability hard. As far as  declared vegans who try to climb mount everest go, only 3 have declared it, 1 has died, that's 66% survival rate. The average survival rate by comparison is 93.5%, therefore, much lower.

One culprit is indeed religion with the whole **born again virgin** thing.

Another one is simply ignorance, they found a significant amount of women in *college* who had some very, very loose definition of virginity because it's ingrained in American society that being a virgin is a valuable trait.

Let's take the two main examples:

**Starcraft 2**: The most obvious of these, they begun strongly on e-sport front, but due to their limitations on tournaments, and mobas coming in and sweeping the casual market, e-sport fell short. It wasn't all bad on Blizzard's front, they did try to make the competitive play more casual, things like probe counters above mineral fields, drones being automatically sent to gather, starting with more drones to reduce the boring eco start of ""I build nothing but a supply depot until 12SCVs, then I start a barrack at 12 SCVs and one at 14 SCVs"". It's fun if you like that kinda stuff, but this isn't what the casual player likes. If you go look at games like Dawn of War 1 or AoE2, like 90% of games played are comp stomps. 

Now, what did SC2 do to get a short renaissance? Their co-op mode is actually quite good, with many ""sub races"" and doing missions solo or with people, and having to buy new commanders, that got people still playing. So PVE was the answer to the dying game.

**Dawn of War 2**: DoW1 was a fairly typical RTS with some twist on resources, but it was great, still one of my favorite RTS. DoW2 changed all that by wanting to focus on a more tactical and competitive aspect, this one I called the *arena RTS*. Now the campaign was actually pretty good, with co-op options, although GFWL really hurt the game initially. It was quite finicky to get it working. Because of this focus on competitive, it made the PVE play quite stale. What truly kept this game relevant for a long time was the co-op survival mode which basically became the main mode. You picked a hero, leveled it up and tried to survive.

Both of these well known series failed to chase the e-sport cow and turned to what people actually want which is more PVE driven content, little too late for that though."

>Change all the time = keep players grinding away. Don't change = player base drops to nill.

The statement never specified arena shooter, you only gave that as your example following it.. I gave you two examples that are opposite of that; little change but lots of players because it's just fun. My point being that the statement is untrue, and in fact I'd agree the arena shooter is simply a case of false equivalency, they failed for entirely different reasons.

Arena shooters issues is high skill gap and floor, the formula is just not very conductive to keep the casual players, they drift towards more friendly experience like CoD and BF, as much as people hate them here. RTS genre also suffered this, although differently. A good chunk of casuals moved from RTS to moba, and a lot of people moved from RTS to 4X(Stellaris,HoI) and turn based strategy games (Civ, Total War). Interestingly, and opposite to your assertion, one of the most popular RTS right now is Age of Empire 2 HD. The game is still hugely popular because it is simply fun, and the vast majority of people play vs comp as well. Yes, they did make 1 or 2 additional DLCS over the past couple years, but those have generally been negatively received as they were fairly low quality. The game still plays like it did 20 years ago, and people still love it.

Although RTS is kind of different in essence because if you look at what keeps player engaged in RTS, it's the PVE for the most part. Like Starcraft 2 still has a lot of players but a huge chunk of those play their ""new"" PVE mission thing. Another example of this is Dawn of War 2, where they pushed hard on e-sport which made the general gameplay kinda meh, it ended up just being an *arena* RTS, coincidentally on topic. The PVE in DoW2 other than the campaign was trash until they added the survival mode which ended up being the most popular mode for DoW2."

Did you know that, currently, players have to play 100 hours in Casual mode before being allowed to even touch Ranked? That's right, a new player has to grind through 100 hours of smurf infested games before finally being able to get a chance at playing against people of his caliber.

Then people wonder why they can't get new players."

pcgaming,fdkchiq,t1_fd9n0cu,1578500963.0,"You don't really talk about it, every time it's brought up it's massively downvoted.

The main issue right now is that Valve is forcing players to play 100 hours in casual against smurfs. I've tried to introduce friends to the game times and times again because they love mobas. But their first experience with the game is getting roflstomped into another dimension. It wouldn't be so bad if it was a limited experience, but the comment I've gotten the most is ""What? I have to play **100 hours** just to be able to pick a role and queue up to play against people of my rough caliber? Fuck that, back to (whatever moba)"".

100 hours is an absurd number, and from looking it up, it seems that Valve's intent was to limit smurfing in ranked... except that doesn't stop smurfing, people just smurf in Casual instead, so now new players have to play through 100 hours against basically 99% smurfs!

I completely agree with you that Dota 2 is the best moba on the market and it's completely free. It's also most egregious and frustrating MOBA for new comers."

The big thing right now is that to get into ranked, I need to play 100 hours. All my previous played games are forgotten. Now, I wasn't expected to jump straight into ranked, play a couple dozen games at least.

But 100 hours? I mean holy crap. That sets the bar stupidly high for newcomers. I can play maybe 4-5 hours a week. So in the best case scenario, no ranked for 5 months?

Games,fdgl0ip,t3_ekw7gp,1578400874.0,"It's funny that nobody said it but Black Desert Online is a decent horse game. 

You have horses from Tier 1 to Tier 8, each horse has a large pool of skills they can learn but can only learn x many.

Leveling horses takes a whole though, you set the game in the background (uses little to no resources) and you set a training loop and they level up. You can capture up to Tier 5 wild horses, then you can breed a male and female, and they can get higher tier (there's a website for that). Depending on the color of the horse, you'll get different breeds, which have different base stats.

That being said the most important thing are leveling stats, one of my fastest horse if a medium base speed who got really good rolls.

You can sell horses to imperial horse delivery for half profit or try to sell it to players.

Once you get a T8 horse, if it learns a very specific set of skills, it becomes a courser, and then you can go and try to transform it into a dream horse, which are stupid expensive.

Other than that, there is obviously racing, which happens periodically on servers and are different brackets. So there could be a tier 5 only race, meaning you do want to breed and keep your fastest T5 with sprint+drift+IA (a combo of skills that make you go ridiculously fast).

For quite a while I basically only played this game for the horse stuff. A T8 can take a bit to level, like 36 hours maybe? So I'd just leave it there and check in now and again."

Blizzard forcing the meta with their changes led to little variation in meta, very repetitive games. Combined with the advent of mobas on the e-sport scene taking large chunks of viewers and *sponsors*, on top of Blizzard's grasp limiting the amount of tournament which in turn meant less sponsorships. A lot of what Blizzard did wasn't healthy for the e-sport scene, but that alone wouldn't have killed SC2.

I'd think mobas were certainly the main aspect. When SC2 was beginning to peak came along with the twitch becoming popular. A lot of more casual players got into SC2, it offered a different play style from the high action FPS games with a more strategical approach, but it still pushed a bit too far on focus.

Moba came along and just ate up the whole casual competitive market, by being easy to pick up, quite relaxing gameplay, etc..."

Games,fczod4s,t1_fcz8jw0,1578105635.0,"My assumption is that someone didn't read the documentation on how dates work properly and miscalled the date parsing.

That's been happening quite a bit recently. I think a year or two ago, some delivery service in the UK had that happen? It's happened to Twitter app I think back in 2015. Look up 2020 software bugs, apparently parking meters in New York failed as well.

Basically, date formats and accessing information from a date system is often handled by the language or comes with a package, and that package has documentation.

Now, those are often very *lengthy*, comes with hundreds of methods of pulling dates. For instance, in python %y gives you the last 2 digits of the year (20), %Y gives you the fully year (2020), and some language will have one for pulling the first digit only. People often only look up the first few lines, and can miss crucial information.

Now as to exactly what they messed up, hard to say, it could be a wide variety of things. 

*My guess* is that they parsed calendars in-game, only two months ahead, when it switched to January that means they tried to load the calendars of January and February, and 2020 is a leap year and something weird happened there because they weren't prepared for that? Anyways, that's just my guess, but I'd be willing to bet it's date parsing related."
