Not to mention that depending on where you live the ""portions"" aren't fit for you average dude either. This is just a smokescreen to shift responsibility."
badwomensanatomy,fdkhep0,t1_fdkgr40,1578503931.0,"It's the most important factor. If you eat less, you lose weight."
badwomensanatomy,fdk9qjo,t1_fdjyehf,1578499264.0,"That's true. However no one is shaming fat people here, only bad logic and bad anatomy. ""Women have higher fat% on average than men"" isn't a reason to be overweight or obese, it's a distraction tactic to make oneself feel better about being fat and pretend like it's unavoidable. 

There are way too many fat people who delude themselves into thinking that they're either not fat or that their being fat is outside their control."
badwomensanatomy,fdk9gvb,t1_fdhp1yy,1578499097.0,"Your body isn't creating fat out of nothing. If you're fat, you're eating too much. ""Difficulty"" in maintaining a healthy body is subjective, it's not more difficult to me to eat less."

These people live lives of luxury and comfort like you and I can't even imagine, let's not feel too bad for them."

YouShouldKnow,fdgm6dg,t1_fdgg6gw,1578401983.0,"Large quantities of blood will make you nauseous, I don't know if there's any other downsides. It's usually pretty harmless to swallow some nose blood, if anything it just feels pretty gross. I used to get nosebleeds when I was a kid and I learned pretty quickly that tilting my head forward instead of backwards makes the whole experience a lot less annoying. That and stuffing rolled up tissue paper in my nostrils."
YouShouldKnow,fdglyhw,t1_fdg6nr4,1578401779.0,"I mean, you can swallow a whole lot of blood before getting nauseous, so. Just drink in moderation?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdetm3t,t1_fdek1po,1578346340.0,"""It's not illegal"" isn't a good argument, stop using it. In any and all cases. No one bases their moral code on the law, not me, not you. Make an honest argument about the ethics of it instead of hiding behind the law. The law can be, and often is, morally wrong."
trippinthroughtime,fdaffrk,t1_fdaas6w,1578245490.0,"Art isn't just about skill. Sometimes it can just be about eliciting emotions. Whether you think this piece is good or not is up to you, but ""it doesn't take skill/anyone could replicate it"" isn't really an argument. 

Art isn't about winning or being the ""most skillful"" or just doing things that are hard to do just for the sake of the difficulty."
