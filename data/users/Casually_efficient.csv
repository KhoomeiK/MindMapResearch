The website has reviews/discussions written by people who apparently do the jobs. Perhaps that website or the sub (findapath) will provide what you‚Äôre looking for."

PlusSize,fejnksw,t3_epig7k,1579180864.0,"You‚Äôre not the only one :-) My usual solution is to buy items that fit me in the shoulders/upper arms, because this is the most restrictive/hard to fit part. Then if the body of the garment looks bulky and shapeless below that point, I take in (meaning, sew to make it smaller) the bust/waist/hip area bit to make the garment appear to fit better. This is pretty easy with simple poly/cotton type fabrics, but more of a challenge with sheer or other fancier fabrics. I usually don‚Äôt buy those for the reason that I‚Äôm not a particularly good sew-er, and I don‚Äôt want to mess it up. But dress shirts, dresses...most of these have seams in places where a little nip/tuck on a home sewing machine won‚Äôt be noticed. If your budget allows, having a tailor do the work for you can make the garment look like it was made for you."

Fantasy,feb6o7u,t3_enucau,1578955891.0,"I really enjoyed [The Warded Man by Peter V. Brett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3428935-the-warded-man?from_search=true&qid=i2qDwyNkCH&rank=1). I‚Äôm currently waiting for the next in the series from my local library; this one was a page turner for me. Without giving too much away, there is magic, and a character in the story does grow stronger in its use over time."
Fantasy,feaxpwy,t1_fe3bbnm,1578953294.0,"Just finished reading [Emily Tesh - Silver in the Woods](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43459657). It‚Äôs the first of a duology of novellas and it has dryads. I love OP‚Äôs artwork (gorgeous), but it‚Äôs a bit different than the way the novella describes the dryads."

PlusSize,fe91b6i,t3_eo5ddo,1578933131.0,"Congratulations on your upcoming big day, OP! When I bought my dress (about 13 yrs ago, but I was about your size, so I think it‚Äôs still good advice), I was really surprised to find the right dress at a local boutique in my small city in Canada, for a very reasonable price (just under $500). I had gone into the store pre-convinced that I wouldn‚Äôt find anything suitable, and ended up being totally (pleasantly) surprised. 

My best advice is to try to keep a bit of an open mind about the exact style you think you want. It‚Äôs great to look at pics of dresses so you have an idea of what you like and can help a bridal consultant understand your style - and maybe rule out designs you really don‚Äôt like or you know from experience won‚Äôt fit the way you‚Äôd like - but try on dresses that do fit, even if they don‚Äôt seem just right when they‚Äôre on the hanger; you might be surprised! The two dresses I picked for myself during that trip to the bridal salon didn‚Äôt work out as well as I thought they would, but when I tried on the dress the consultant picked (which had seemed just ‚Äúso-so‚Äù on the hanger), it was like it was made for me. I felt gorgeous and I knew right away that it was the one, even though it was different from some of the dresses I‚Äôd been mooning over in pictures :-)

Best of luck with your search!"
WoT,fe7ml3f,t1_fe6xyji,1578916545.0,Haha! I see what happened there. Glad I didn‚Äôt use her name when I wrote; the bot‚Äôs response probably would‚Äôve freaked me out. Thanks for the answer.
happy,fe5di1h,t3_enuglz,1578868090.0,Awesome accomplishments; great work and congratulations!
WoT,fe4ibnq,t1_fdswici,1578859580.0,"I‚Äôm not OP, but OMG, I‚Äôm so glad someone else noticed the braid tugging. What‚Äôs up with that?! I just finished book 3 and if the one character who does this (I won‚Äôt name her, to avoid spoiling anything for OP) didn‚Äôt tug her braid so often, the book might have been a good 20 pages shorter! Does she eventually stop it, or am I in for another nine books with the same quirk? (I‚Äôll read them anyways; love the series, just surprised by this particular repetition and curious to know if it goes on.)"
PlusSize,fe4btj0,t3_enpbuh,1578857692.0,Suuuper adorable; what a great outfit! I particularly like the nod to nautical styling on the bodice of the dress.
