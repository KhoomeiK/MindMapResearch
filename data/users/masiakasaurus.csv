So what. It is an official flag, OP asked unofficial. The uninformed may take your comment as meaning that Basque flags are not used by the government, but they are.

>'Annexation'? What a curious word to use, when the Spanish Constitution allows and forsees the possibility of Navarra and the CAV joining together.

Annexation is just a word. Meaning the act of joining something into a bigger something. It doesn't have a negative meaning in itself. There is such thing as legal, peaceful, and consented annexation.

Yes, I'm well aware of what the constitution says about Navarre joining the CAV. It's very much irrelevant to this discussion but whatever. If Navarre ever votes to join the CAV it will... join the CAV. Become another province of the CAV. The Navarran flag will be the flag of a Navarra province and the current CAV's flag will be the ikurriña. The capital of the region will be Vitoria, not Pamplona. That means Navarre will be annexed into/by the CAV or willingly annex itself into the CAV, however you want to put it.

>Nothing ironic about it, considering that the territories currently in the CAV were once part of Navarra itself

That's exactly what is ironic. The only Basque state that has ever existed in history was the Kingdom of Pamplona/Navarre, with its capital in Pamplona and its red banner with chains. The current CAV were nothing but its western fringes when they were part of it. If you knew nothing about Basque nationalism, you'd assume Basque nationalism would be all about the restoration of independent Navarre and its institutions. But they are not. Basque nationalism, in its current form, is very much born, bred, and centered around Biscay. I don't blame Navarrese who oppose joining the CAV because they see it as a takeover by Bilbao."

The Balkans or Italy is the only one with evidence of collecting bird feathers, southern Spain the only with collected shells (not fir food) and alleged cave art, and so on. In fact, Neanderthal communities are belueved to have been smaller and less interconnected than sapiens communities and that's presumed to have been a factor in their extinction.
