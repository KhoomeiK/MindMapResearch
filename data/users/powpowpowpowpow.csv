https://www.health.harvard.edu/cold-and-flu/can-vitamin-c-prevent-a-cold

Every vitamin is a proven benefit in that they are defined as a nutrient that if lacking will cause a known specific disease.  With our current food availability outright cases of something like scurvy are not terribly common but there are millions of people who might eat a donut and coffee for breakfast, a McDonald's burger for lunch and some Mac and cheese for dinner and they keep doing this maybe the only reason they don't get clinically diagnosable  scurvy is because they get a craving for a soda that has some citric acid in it every once in a while.  There are millions of people who eat and drink this stuff, look at the sales figures.  There are no real nutrients in this stuff, maybe just enough to make it so they do not have an easily diagnosable nutritional deficiency.  But they sure as fuck can be diagnosed as depressed and their SSRI deficiency can by rectified.

There is no established medical framework that creates an assembly line for sub clinical or near clinical deficiencies.  There are some doctors who do this but you can't buy them on the stock market and their findings don't light their stock price on fire or even get any publicity."

Antipsychiatry,fdljis1,t1_fdldg9u,1578525410.0,"That is an assertion, not a statement backed up with a lot of verify able facts.

Yes some vitamins are too expensive but not all vitamins are, most vitamins are inexpensive enough that even a marginal benefit is worth it.  Vitamin C does help a bit with colds and I can tell you that B1, electrolytes and water work great for a hangover.

No you aren't going to get the dramatic effects of something like an amphetamine.  

Vitamins can't be patented, the can't be controlled by a pharma corporation, so maybe their multi billion dollar PR machine might drop a few hits on vitamins being worthless.

Our society is loaded with soda pop, McDonald's, 7-11 food, sugar frosted cereal, chips, fried bits, etc...  There's no nutrition in any of that, even supermarkets are mostly garbage.  Rates of depression are also going up.  Vitamins aren't a direct cure but they can have some benefits at the margins especially if there is a serious deficiency.

Seriously, go back and look at the efficacy of nutrition programs like adding iodine to salt and vitamin d to milk.  There have been significant benefits."

Antipsychiatry,fdl3lyd,t1_fdkw8un,1578516481.0,"Why would you assume that? 

We are talking about people who have something wrong. The simplest thing and least obtrusive thing in the world is to make sure they do not have a deficiency.  Also there are physical conditions that affect the bodies ability tometabolise or retain nutrients and vitamins.

If you just gave them some vitamins and told them that they help some people (true) and utilized the placebo effect while you tested for an underlying medical condition at least you wouldn't be giving them something harmful.  I certainly wouldn't object to that approach."
Antipsychiatry,fdkromk,t1_fdk5oee,1578509746.0,Bullshit.  Vitamins are not present in sufficient amounts in all food especially with a poor diet.  People do get scurvy and other deficiency diseases still and sub clinical deficiencies are common.
