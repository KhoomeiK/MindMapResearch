childfree,fdst8k7,t1_fdspiac,1578707638.0,"Yes, that's exact right.  It took the doctors a while to figure out what was wrong with him.  I remember being at the emergency room and the doctor putting my screaming little brother in a bath of ice water to get his temperature down.

He was also given an vest that cooled him, an air conditioner vest. I remember my mom being on the news talking about it.

Now that hes older he can figure out when hes too hot and we can figure it out by him starting to be an extra dick to everyone.  Then we'd tell him literally go cool down and stop being an ass."
