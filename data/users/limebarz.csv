Been 3 years since she left me for her AP and I still struggle with the situation. I think 50/50 custody is best for the kids but it's hard for me to move forward and establish a new relationship... Anyway, happy for you! Congrats."

Damnthatsinteresting,fehi7de,t1_fehewi1,1579117054.0,Damn. You're absolutely right. Never imagined the possibilities of that before. In the future there could be photo-realistic deepfake porn of anyone (provided you have accurate visual and/or audio reference material)... Marilyn Monroe. Elvis. Your secret crush. ANYONE.
