AmItheAsshole,ff8pdqu,t3_es3p8q,1579690262.0,"I was talking to my friend (daughters mum) the other day and we came to the conclusion that parenting is the biggest trial and error experiment most people will ever take part in. If you get it 60% right or better and your child becomes a good human being, that's really all you can ask for and you did a good job. Don't worry about doing everything right, you will make mistakes. Do your best, show them right from wrong and love them. That's all anyone can do. Good luck."

YouShouldKnow,fekac6f,t1_fek9yra,1579195900.0,"Haha. I'm going to go with a no on that one. It sounds metallic when I tap it, not that I have much to compare it to ceramic wise. Does a plate count?"
YouShouldKnow,fek8eah,t1_fek847e,1579194753.0,"Haha. Yep. It's like a half or quarter sized hair straightener with a comb on one side.

Edit: word

Edit again: I have no idea what I was thinking of, may have been combining the hair straighteners and the beard/hair drying comb. It's a comb that heats up and you brush it through your hair or beard that straightens as it goes. Good thing I kept it."
YouShouldKnow,fek800n,t1_fek7djd,1579194518.0,"Your first example sounds very similar to my reaction to and thoughts on what happened but more eloquently put. With an interesting take on obtaining names and addresses, unless specified everyone registered to vote (UK) appears on the voting register which is very cheap and easy to search. Good catch."
YouShouldKnow,fek5g37,t1_fek4tnq,1579193000.0,"Sounds like maybe they use it for a time frame and then move on. My hopeful and naive conclusion, is they got any address or contact details from an order you placed with them legitimately and used it to send you stuff so they could leave positive reviews. But I'm sure somebody's bank account got hacked along the way. Don't suppose you need a curling iron so you. Haha."
YouShouldKnow,fek4mf7,t1_fek438a,1579192504.0,"It's definitely a random collection of stuff that's for sure. I'm not sure about the podcasts explanation though, how do they get your address and you can't leave a review if you don't have the item in your orders. At least I haven't found a way to leave one. Same time frame though, 2 to 3 months and I've had nothing since the end of November roughly."
YouShouldKnow,fek46nb,t1_fek2yw4,1579192238.0,"It's definitely worth a look, speaking to my daughter she reminded me of 2 more items I received. Hair curling iron and a posh iPhone screen protector that came with a frame to get it perfectly lined up. I gave that to a friend at work at the time."
YouShouldKnow,fek3t3i,t1_fek2tdr,1579192013.0,"Haha. I looked up a couple of the items and yes, there was a review from a jado (not 5150). So I'm unsure if it was me, my first name is pretty common but the dates were fairly close between the item arriving and the review."
YouShouldKnow,fek3j4i,t1_fek1shj,1579191846.0,"What I took from their post is that although it might look free at first glance, if you use amazon a lot they could hide the payments in among your purchases. Meaning they actually have access to your account and bank details, or they are using somebody else's bank to pay for the items. Which isn't nice for them. 

Best case scenario and my first thought, it was an amazon or eBay seller (I've bought from ebay before and it arrived in amazon packaging), that you've bought from so they have your name and address that use their own money to buy the item but have to ship it to be able to leave a review. They get most of their money back but can leave a good review artificially pushing it up the amazon rankings, possibly raking in even more money. Which was an idea also mentioned by OP."
YouShouldKnow,fejwsju,t1_fejvxl4,1579187644.0,"My daughter walked off with that but if I find it I'll let you know. Not sure if it's up to much though, I did search it on amazon and it was about £15."
YouShouldKnow,fejvbjf,t1_fejugu0,1579186686.0,"No issue, I don't remember saying there was one? Just that I've also experienced the same issue as OP.

Actually, some minor issues: I don't have a fitbit, I don't have a beard, I don't have an iPhone 11 and I have no use for a USB microphone."
YouShouldKnow,fejl3e1,t3_epgcr8,1579178537.0,"I had a few of these, the last arriving at the end of November. I've received a USB microphone, beard straighteners, a charging dock for a fitbit and an iPhone case. Every time they came I checked my amazon and bank account, I've not been charged for any of the items and they don't appear on my orders. Honestly didn't know there was a process to return them."
AskReddit,fejcmf7,t3_ep9ur1,1579167344.0,"African warlords. There were 2 groups of soldiers, one were on their knees in front of the other while the highest ranking soldier walked behind the kneeling group possibly shouting (no audio). Then he walks up behind one of the kneeling soldiers, grabs his hair and just starts hacking at the guys neck with his machete. It wasn't a clean cut like you see in the movies, he may as well have been using a rusty spoon. Easily the worst thing I've seen."

AmItheAsshole,feg9lu3,t3_eovesf,1579083682.0,"NTA. I'm sure there was a similar story on here a month or so ago. The pregnant person moved in then tried to pressure the original tenant to move out saying it would be easier for her to get somewhere else than the pregnant lady.

VPN,feg5cj2,t3_eow522,1579077656.0,"Unless part of your sign up process is, what are you going to use this VPN for? To which they say commit crime, possible paedophilia and maybe a touch of selling drugs. In that case they may be able to prove prior knowledge and conspiracy to commit.

But generally, are car manufacturers liable when someone runs someone else over, are gun manufacturers liable when someone gets shot, are duct tape manufacturers liable when a serial killer takes a victim.

But something about your post worries me, you definitely aren't setting it up with the express purpose of allowing people to commit crimes? Right?"

But the second she says she doesn't like it and you don't stop, then you would become TA. Some other people brought up the power dynamic, which is an interesting point.

AmItheAsshole,fdns8wl,t3_elxvfn,1578591795.0,"This is a tough one. I'm gonna say NTA and believe it is just down to you both being young. Why did she need to know the extent of your friendship, with regards to the fwb situation? There was no need to bring that up at all, seems like your friend was trying to sabotage that relationship from the start. How would you feel if you were told straight away that your new boyfriend used to have casual sex with his female best friend, I bet you'd have trust issues too.

As far as your friendship is concerned, my best friend of 11 years is female and also an ex. We have a 13 year old together so it's hard to hide the fact we had a relationship but it's not something we throw in their faces. Surprisingly it's hard enough to meet new partners when your best friend is a member of the opposite sex as it is. Without making it harder.

Maybe next time don't mention that you 2 have had sex. Otherwise you may as well just tell them about everyone you've slept with? Not implying it's a lot or anything, just that you might as well include your whole history. Or as the case may be, his whole history."

It's about as positive as I get, I still have faith that humanity is mostly good. Hopefully."

dating,fdk0z18,t3_elsi00,1578493344.0,"I agree with everything u/patorikum said, except I think it's both and not neither. I also have similar problems meeting women, I found one recently that I thought was possibly going to go somewhere. She kept saying men seemed put off by how upfront she was, I said I actually don't mind it. I like to know where I stand. Everytime we spoke she said how nice I was and that she really liked me, then she'd vanish for days. I would message her a few days later, she didn't give a specific reason as to why she vanished (not that I asked, she felt the need to apologise) just work. I left it and carried on where we left off, then she vanished again. This time I didn't text her, I haven't heard from her since. I think you, me, her have all put ourselves in a negative mindset. You possibly choose bad boys, assuming you'll get hurt anyway. She expected me to leave after she put herself out there, so she left first. I expect to be let down and left, so let her leave. 

Therefore confirming all of our doubts and fears and driving us further away from finding happiness. 

Hopefully is something that can be overcome, good luck."

You've been amazing and have given up a lot, don't completely pull away from your nephew as has been mentioned he'll never forget who raised him. That's you. But you're young and need to live your life too. If your parents can't look after him then they need to put the responsibility back onto your sister.

AmItheAsshole,fdefxes,t3_eksb4t,1578338164.0,"I know how you feel about family, I was pretty much forgotten as a child. I had 2 older sisters, one loud and selfish, the other just a yes man to that sister. I was quiet from constant bullying by the loud sister. I cut off contact with that sister completely as soon as I moved out and was pretty minimal contact with my mum and eldest sister for a while. I did make up with my mum and had a very good relationship for years up until she died a few years ago very suddenly. My eldest sister is still minimal contact but better than its been for years. It's been about 20 years since I cut contact with the loud sister and we're still pretty much no contact. I know the worry you have about being alone but I got to choose my family and they are very few in number but I can trust them 100%. You already have friends, that's a good place to start. Good luck."

AmItheAsshole,fcmvsty,t3_ehrttw,1577794579.0,"YTA. You put a friend over your wife and child, you should also think about your feelings for this friend and your wife. You have very questionable priorities. You didn't want to leave work as they are short staffed for your wife giving birth to your first child but left at the drop of a hat for this friend. To mention nothing of the last time your wife went into labour it was a still birth, which also nullifies your point of having the rest of its life to be with your child. Probably one of the most clear cut TA I've seen on here."
