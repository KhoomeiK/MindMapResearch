Though the pee was not as easy as the furniture there is level with the ground) whenever my mother was gone for an extended period. He was a bit fixated on her, despite my boyfriend and I taking care of him to at least an equal amount, if not more. We also live in the same house and apartment (it is my family's house and is pretty big). But whenever she was gone, he'd do this, despite having gone down to the garden only shortly before. It was obvious he did this on purpose.

Now, we didn't put up with this literal shit for too long. At one point, we made it clear we wouldn't take it. I don't recall what exactly did, but some stern talking (sound of voice is relevant. You could shout sweet nothings at a dog and they'd understand it as ""angry"", as long as no familiar words are in there. Also, you could curse at them in the cutest voice ever, and they'd be endlessly happy. Above mentioned dog can be the cutest asshole sometimes. No really, he's a clever ass. I have some other stories of what he did, which goes beyond simple cleverness but transcends into advanced planning with multiple steps.) to was involved. I guess in the end we clarified we are a higher rank than him, and while we understand that he misses my mother, but we are also there. 

Also, he used to not voice his desire to go poop (used to be an outdoor dog at his previous home, so I guess that is understandable), and it took some time to teach him. 

These days he only does this when he is sick and can't voice it fast enough (like in the night). He also has been getting way more cuddly in his old ages. He used to come by for about 20 seconds close cuddling a day, and then was happy with just being nearby where we are. These days it can  be up to 40 seconds multiple times a day. He's sweet."

I am fully aware of the witchdoctor markets having been known to also offer albino children, which is absolutely terrible and despicable. Selling dried parts of birds is one thing, killing and selling people is something completely different.

What I was trying to say is that, seen from here at least, it appears that the Chinese markets of this type have gone beyond harbouring old and mostly wrong concepts (along the lines of ""this thing got a huge dick/some part of it is phallic, I am sure it can boost my libido"", but also stuff that might simply be harmful.) and house medicines (which can be absolutely fine, herbs, teas etc, often actually based on experience. Chamomile, willow bark. You get the idea. Keep harbouring those no worries there.). How did they go beyond? By making it a huge market. I don't think any other market of this kind has grown into such a huge business while in many parts still being highly illegal. It is a big business.

This is nothing against chinese people, or their way of thinking in general. I'm sorry for not clarifying. The ones that take the cake are the ones that have pushed this kind of thing to grow into such a size.

Also I am aware this is not just a chinese thing. But china is a big country with a lot of people. That alone makes it prone to have any kind of market grow to enormous size. That itself is not bad. But what the markets are, that is what can be bad.

Just because you provide a service, doesn't mean you have to be treated badly. You are there out of your choice and you could also refuse them service. You are not their slave (and if they see you as such, shame on them). You are not even a servant! This is business being conducted, not some kind of social ranking. 

There's some people who think anyone who provides a service has to do it because supposedly they are your lessers. Or even have to thank them for ""honouring"" you that you can serve them. I remember someone complaining that young people go ""Happy to help"" instead of ""Thank you for shopping."". It's such a different mindset. The ""happy to help"" shows such good nature that you help them because you *want* to be helpful, not because you *have* to serve. Be happy that others are happy I say. 

I think you handled this perfectly. You pointed out, in a very subtle way, that you are fully aware of their rudeness, and without even saying the words you showed them you will not stand for it.

He knows he fucked up, maybe he'll think twice about making stupid rude comments in whatever languafe after having been humbled a bit.

His friend even laughed. I am sure they will remind him of it for a while.

Hair,fg9u4x8,t1_ffdez9r,1580643232.0,"Water softener is really just salt. As in, you could theoretically eat it as it has to be food safe (it comes in the form of large pieces about the size of walnuts), though I still wouldn't do so as even though it has to be safe the standards are still a bit different from food salt. It makes sense if you think about it, as it *could* come in contact with your drinking water. It should not, because its purpose is to remove the residue of what was removed from the water, from the machine itself. It does not remove the stuff from the water on its own.

(Also don't use food salt in your water softening device, it is too small grained, and if it has anti-caking agents, or other stuff like iodine or fluoride in it, it might not work properly to de salt. An actual common anti-caking agents is magnesium chloride, which defeats the purpose, as it is one of the things you want to remove from the water softening device.) 

There's not much you can change about the salt you put in. 

However, maybe they have it set to too soft. It should not get salty, as like I said, salt should not even come in direct contact with the water being softened, just with the part that has been filtered out for waste flushing. If the water is salty, check if the machine has a problem.

There's the occasional odd discovery. Last year it was I think, they spotted a bomb sticking out of the landscape above a pedestrian path by the river, and apparently it had been sticking out for quite some time. It was at a steep decline by a river, and no one ever got close enough to recognise it. People probably thought it was a rock, until one person recognised it.

Last year, the fire brigade in Frankfurt discovered a bomb in the Main river while doing training for underwater work.

The area is really dangerous. There's signs that there's explosives, and not to enter. It is on one side of a pedestrian path. The grandpa of a friend is hunter and has told of cases where it smelled like grilled pig in the foret, and then he saw half a boar that had triggered a mine or such in that area. Last summer, that area was particularly problematic, as there was a big fire there (probably by an old sulphur grenade), and the fire brigade couldn't really walk in.

oddlysatisfying,ffhs32c,t1_ffho1fz,1579950989.0,"Yeast doesn't automatically make it bread. The reason why you use baking powder instead of yeast is just that the dough can't be too soft. It needs a stronger dough.

There's many traditional cakes using yeast. So common actually, that my fiancé always refused to lick the mixing attachment when I asked him if he wanted it. At first I tought that he didn't feel like sweet stuff at the time, but after like the 10th cake I asked why specifically. He said he didn't want to get belly aches. Took me a second to realise he thought I was using yeast.

The dough in a yeast cake might be a bit less sweetish though, but used as a carrier material for stronger toppings like fruit.

Some examples that are definitely not bread (and some might not be cake proper either) are Strudel, Stollen (this can be considered quite breadish I realise. I wouldn't think of it as either of the two, it is just Stollen. All on its own.), New Orleans Kings Cake (at least I think it has yeast), classic Guglhupf, and most of what we call ""Blechkuchen"" in Germany. Blechkuchen is a cake that is baked on a whole oven tray. It is rather flat, and the dough is not too sweet - it is usually topped with somethung like apples, plums, pears, poppyseed, or just Streusel (sweet crumbs). Often Streusel are added to any of the other toppings. The dough for the Blechkuchen is called ""Stutenteig""."

They might be doing it right when not paying attention to it, but once they do pay attention (taking a deep breath, while singing, etc.), they often push out their breath.

If it is some highly rare animal (which I hope it isn't), the effort to make the most of it will be higher, due to its value. But for regular cow or pig? Not necessarily. It is highly unlikely you'll have ever seen a cow's face on a bag without noticing. 


For pigs, you can sell the ears and the snout and stuff otherwise. Either to places people will eat it, or to be made into dog treats. Same for cows.

Special exceptions are smaller animals, like, rabbits, hamsters  or minks. Sometimes even foxes. Then again, the variations in their face is often smaller, and you can hide more if you use them for fur and not go to make them into leather. 

And yes, I mentioned hamsters. European field hamsters. They are quite a bit larger than the ones used as pets, but still not super huge. They'll make the most of the pelt, and sow it together to make it one square piece. That is, used to. They are highly endangered due to overhunting both for the fur and the usual fear they might destroy the entire harvest.
