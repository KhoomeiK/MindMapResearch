Okeechobee does this and I believe Shaky Knees does too. But again, those are in the southeast. Good luck though!

Moustache,fckias0,t1_fcj8bw7,1577725949.0,I use Death Grip wax but it’s a really tacky one and my stache doesn’t have nearly as much natural curl to it as yours does. I’ve heard good stuff about the Fireman brand too.
