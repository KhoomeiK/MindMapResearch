Should we be denying them birthright citizenship just to stop a handful of people who are 'cheating the system' even though most of them will likely never return to Canada, or if they do, will be no different than any other immigrant, other than the fact that they'd be granted automatic entry into the country?

Of course not. Permanent residents are here because they are **permanent** residents, i.e. they want to be part of Canadian society. Permanent residents respected our laws enough to go through the immigration process. 

There is a pretty big difference between PR's and foreign nationals using Canada as a country of convenience to have their kids. The CBSA turns people away for much triter reasons like not having enough money in their bank account. Surely turning people away for planning to have a baby in Canada for immigration purposes makes a lot more sense.

And if they do return to Canada, they will be very different from the average immigrant who has had to go through a years long immigration process. They will be people who take Canada for granted because they found a way to cheat our system and will carry that mentality forward in everything from taxes to national allegiance.
