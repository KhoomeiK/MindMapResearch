ChoosingBeggars,ffaw3m4,t3_ese45f,1579745844.0,"In Portugal we had a great example of this type of Choosing Beggar, with a celebrity. I don't know if you heard about this celebrity, his name is Jos√© Castelo Branco.

Well, in a video, a beggar near him is asking for money, and he calls this beggar and gives her a coin (1 euro)... Well, the beggar, not satisfied with that, starts demanding him more money, asking him for 5 euros, because she ""needs it and has children at home waiting for her"" and etc. Well, he gives her such a verbal lesson, that most portuguese people know, because it kinda became a ""funny catch up"", or, as we call it, ""apanhado""... 
The funny thing is, he uses God as an example and his way of talking, alongside the words he uses. He starts saying to her ""go find a job"", and then goes on to ""you are on drugs"" because the woman doesn't stop trying (in a crying manner) to get even more money from him... Until he says ""and my God bless you"", gives her two goodbye kisses in the face and sends her away.

Again, its the way he acts up and talks that makes this the Pearl it is..."

AskReddit,fephd61,t3_eqband,1579320528.0,"Ending up with my first girlfriend. My father (a really racist, homophobic, strict, rude person) kinda blackmailed me to end it all, because he wouldn't allow his 15 year old son to have a girlfriend (despite making fun of him for many things including that)... And I feared him, because we would beat me up constantly for small things. And I ended the relationship with her, without wanting to, but because I was scared of him...

2 years later, I got mentally sick and the doctors didn't knew what was the reason for that, and he'd beat me up with everything he could grab on, saying I was a liar and I was doing on purpose by failing on my studies and everything else... This went on for years... I still haven't got rid of the mental disease that assaults me (got diagnosed as a serious depression with some symptoms of PTSD), so I regret too not fighting back sooner. Not imposing myself to him, you know? 

Unfortunately I regret a lot of things in my life, and most of them are really related with this person, who I don't even think of as my family anymore. Not ever again."

depression,feiqhyr,t1_fefvzdp,1579144676.0,"We don't wanna get out because, now, we are always suffering. We expect to suffer, every day, every time something happens. We expect being disappointed about our path in life, our relationships with other people... We are expecting all of that, and that makes us know that ""we won't get out of this"". Because one thing that happens with depressed people is that we forget how to handle disappointment, how to handle the normal bad things in life. And no one wants to suffer again. So we prefer to suffer every day than to be happy and well and liking that feeling and then having to suffer real hard all again and trying to get ourselves together, AGAIN."

That they don't need to tell me what I have to do, I already know it too damm well, and it kills me inside because I have dreams and unfortunately I can't fufill them.

as for myself... well. In the middle of a severe depression and some symptoms of PTSD, various issues with friendships and trust, non existent self-esteem/self-confidence... some memory/concentration/learning dificulties, no job... just trying to hang on here and trying to make my life make some sense.   


People say that karma is a bitch, but there are exceptions. My situation is one of those exceptions. I was the one bullied and the one whose life got real bad. Those people who made fun of me and hurt me by being toxic are doing too well in their lifes... It's sad."
