I was responsible for 25 software packages, projects using Visual Basic 3,  VB6, VB.net, C#.net, various generations of Access and VBA, Objective-C/XCode, Java and Android Studio, two different database packages, primitive APIs developed in house by a guy who learned dev on the fly, who is moderately autistic and impossible to communicate with because he smelled like roadkill and was angry if you asked him for guidance on his work because it interrupted his Dungeon’s and Dragons 3rd party dev hobby which he spent 90% of his workday on.  I was responsible for customer support, we had over 5,000 customers which had paid support packages, some running Windows 3.1 packages that had a Windows CE mobile extension.  I could go on and on how fucking crazy the demands were, I also was supposed to do remote installation, training, and support for new customers.  

Oh yeah, I was in charge of IT infrastructure for three locations and 90 employees.  That alone was a full time job.  

The fellow I replaced was an immigrant, he put in up to 10 hours a day of his own time on top of the 8 he was paid for, to keep up with the load, because he was terrified of losing the job.

The owner was a cocaine addict, and well over 3/4 of our staff were too.  They were obnoxious and abusive.

I literally had a nervous breakdown after two years of scrambling around trying to perform this jobs needs with no help from these lunatics, all the while being literally threatened with beating or murderer by the managers, who told me the owner is involved in an organized crime syndicate.  To top it all off, I was sexually harassed by a faction of highly aggressive homosexual men who were part of the organization, who made up about 20% of the staff at my location. 

These people sought out and harassed my exwife and high school aged son when they felt I wasn’t performing to their obnoxious standards.
