SubredditDrama,fem2xak,t1_fem2nnb,1579237990.0,"lol, no, I just saw She's The Man coming at me, and I saw it as finger-aggression rather than slap-aggression."

But yeah, Alex says in some video that he's very much a beta male and they needed an alpha male to run the show... I liked it when Greg said he might fuck off and Alex said ""Well we'd just have to ask David Walliams"" because, well, yes, same difference."
SubredditDrama,fem2f2x,t1_fem27k8,1579237526.0,"I grew up pretty privileged and I wanted to be a Disney animator for 3 or 4 years in elementary/middle school, so the two times my family went to Disney World were fucking amazing.

Not sure what you're getting at?"
SubredditDrama,fem22q1,t1_fem1joc,1579237218.0,Yes....?
panelshow,fem20kr,t1_fem1ney,1579237166.0,"Aw poop. 

Certainly, we have to allow for All The Producer Shenanigans. One of my best friends is a reality TV associate producer and OMFG. I was definitely hoping that Greg's points were genuine.... but I suppose it doesn't seem that likely.

BTW my appreciation of the show shot up about 500% when I found out that Alex creates almost all of it. XD"

SubredditDrama,fem18f7,t1_fem0bd7,1579236472.0,"Sorry, I just saw the gif title, and apparently it's about slapping? Sorry that wasn't clear to me. Apparently I think Disney Tweens are more likely to finger me than slap me, for whatever that's worth."
SubredditDrama,fem132s,t1_fem0bd7,1579236340.0,You mean.... finger her with the finger of a Disney Tween????
SubredditDrama,felzw4v,t1_fely02p,1579235332.0,"What is ""traditionally discipline""?"
SubredditDrama,felzut0,t1_felxb6p,1579235301.0,"THANK YOU. YES. It's years of trial-and-error or just a simple ""hey internet, is my asshole-meter off?""

TBH i expect AITA has taken a lot of money away from hardworking therapists :-)"
domesticviolence,felz42i,t3_epttyo,1579234681.0,"Here's my honest advice:

If you want the TRO, then you need to show up to the hearing. It doesn't matter what you did or didn't do. If you want to keep him away from you, then you need to go to the hearing. 

Him saying ""do not text me or I'm pressing harassment charges"" is just another way of him trying to control you. It's ok that you called and texted him, you were upset. Some jerk might be mean to you at the hearing, but the important thing is that you show up, so you can be clear that what you want NOW is to keep him away.

Let me know how it goes!"
depression,felyhms,t3_epiyby,1579234186.0,"I'm fascinated that so many replies are about daydreaming, because that wasn't my thought at all when I read the question. 

For several years, as an adult, I liked to pretend that my (vaguely emotionally neglectful) parents were actually my aunt and uncle. It really helped me to appreciate what they're able to give me, and stop feeling so resentful that they can't give me more. Basically I just lowered the bar for them in my own head, and now I get to have a positive if limited relationship with them."
Divorce,felxqxb,t1_feliy8k,1579233609.0,Why.... does anyone have to pay child support.... if both parents have equal legal parental rights???????? Genuine question.
Divorce,felxn13,t1_fel6bi7,1579233531.0,"I'm sorry, she's on ""head meds""???? 

I understand that the relationship was awful and that you're glad it never got as messy as it might have. I feel the same way about my ex.

But it seems a little odd to put ""head meds"" in the same category as drug and alcohol abuse, when it ought to be clear nowadays that some brains aren't as good at making the right chemicals as other brains."
panelshow,felwqzj,t1_felsckg,1579232870.0,"Oh yes. There's a very good moment in a Catsdown where Roisin Conaty brings ""queen face paper"" (money) as her lucky mascot. Somehow the conversation gets to where Jimmy says ""Actually I had to give a lot of my queen face paper back to the queen.""

I'm not sure how sketchy Jimmy's finances were, but hot damn he handled it like a champ."
panelshow,felwgrn,t1_felaxqx,1579232659.0,"Yes! I have always thought this! Whatever he personally thinks about the whole debacle, Jimmy clearly decided right from the beginning that he would grin and bear it, take his lumps, poke fun at himself, whatever you want to call it, while also taking full responsibility. The 8oo10c from that week is a frikkin masterclass in how to handle a scandal. 

I liked him OK as a comedian before that, but I genuinely respect him as a person for how he handled dealing with fucking up and the public shame that goes with it. He's clever enough to know that showing any exasperation would have been fatal to his career, and I admire that.

Have you seen his latest Netflix special? He makes a joke early on about needing to adapt his material for American audiences... then later, makes a tax joke at his own expense and says ""Don't Google that, Americans, I'm a good guy."" I almost died."
Lithops,felv1z0,t3_eptato,1579231648.0,"They're so pretty! I love how you can see that one old leaf in the very center crumpling up like a pie crust. This is the point where I actually put my hands behind my back when I look at mine, because I just don't trust myself to not pick at it!"
depression,fc4inhf,t3_efyemj,1577417758.0,"Yes. This. It drives me nuts. I have struggled with depression etc since I was 20. I’m 38 now and I’ve had a shit-ton of therapy and I’ve got the right meds finally and I’m able to say things like “my life is pretty ok and I’m able to choose to be positive and happy most of the time,” and let me tell you, I’m fucking grateful to have made it to this point, because there were times it might not have turned out this way.

And then people like my dad will say, “I just don’t get it! I wake up and every day is a new day!” With the not-so-subtle implication that it should be the same for me. 

And you want to scream at them, shake them, hit them, whatever it takes to make them understand: YOU ARE SO LUCKY. You are fortunate, blessed, privileged, that you don’t have to deal with this kind of mental health issues. 

But they don’t say “gosh, I’m sorry that you have to learn how to live with a burden that I haven’t been given and don’t understand. How can I help?”

They say, “I don’t get it. I wake up happy every day.”"

explainlikeimfive,fc4gibj,t1_fc46s7f,1577415989.0,“Of course”? Is that in one of the books mentioned? Because I legit love the idea of old timey mutton chops thinking “we are at the forefront of human ingenuity! let’s see how this is solved!” and then being super cranky about the clock answer.
