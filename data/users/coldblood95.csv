vegan,fc26548,t3_efmsrd,1577342136.0,"To be honest, lot of people including some here don’t emphasise on how Non-Veg food is actually NOT healthy, please if you could spare some time I would highly suggest to watch “What the health” it’s on Netflix and on YouTube for free. 

And eating vegan food is in fact healthy because it’s the direct source of nutrition. I feel now it’s the time so make people more aware how meat affects negatively on health instead of just saying you are hurting animals. 

There are people who still think ( including some doctors) that meat is healthy, because that’s what corporations have manipulated the medicine and food industry for profit.

I think it’s time to focus more on Heath benefits."
