writing,fdkt1p3,t1_fdklee0,1578510556.0,"What I ment with the last part is that when the hero and the villain want to get the same thing by different means its not necesarely that they're gonna have the victory for themselves, but for the force they represent. A classic example whould be Lord of the rings Frodo failed but the ring got destroyed (so he indirectly suceeded), the victory is not for himself, but for the ""side of good guys"" who as Sauron, wanted to be the dominant force of Middle earth, the diference between the two is how they want to become the dominant force and what morals they stand for. (kinda like in the Bible)

So my question is: what are some alternatives beyond that specific hero-villain relationship?"

anime,fdioghy,t3_ee5ruu,1578447459.0,"Wolf's rain was such a beautiful experience for me, it's an anime that shows beauty and love in such an intimal and incorporeal way, my favourite scene is the one in wich Myu and Kiba play with each other in the paradise while the song ""Run wolf warrior, run"" sounds on the background, such a powerful scene, it makes me cry whenever I remember it."
writing,fdifhej,t3_eliiqk,1578441720.0,"Important point> do not forget the age of the characters, you have to get inside their head, wich means they sometimes will have to be more childish or mature , a 12 years old talking like a 22 YO feels fake, a 35 years old man talking like a 22 YO feels inmature, another tip is to remember that male and female brains act different so men and women are more prone to think in certain ways that you need to take in consideration, same goes for different cultures and religions, they are more prone to make your characters think, act and react different in subtle ways"
writing,fdieqrs,t1_fdhilo0,1578441241.0,"Also most of the time the MC and the love interest get in love after a couple of days and end up having sex it feels so artificial, as if the characters didn't had a life before the story started, actually very few stories begin with the MC already in a happy relationship."

When some friends of mine in an art group I was began to say that it was wrong for me to draw to get views and become known instead of sitting for hours drawing with a smile on my face. It just frustrated me how they thought I was drawing for the wrong reasons and I had to have the exact same view of art they have.
