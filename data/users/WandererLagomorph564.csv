Roms,ff6jd0r,t1_ff6fn94,1579628447.0,"Got all of those, now I'm at the part where I upload the changes, where do I do that? I'm looking at the cloned and original repos and not seeing much, pull requests are either grayed out or the upload says somethings wrong."

LineageOS,fev2dfn,t1_fetxsdl,1579392314.0,"Shit.
Are any of those good for rooting to put Lineage on? Or am I just fucked?"

Tetris,fep066d,t3_dsxrbf,1579309196.0,"Same here, Most links I find are either dead or broken, the closest is the V2 link but that's missing a few skins, including the ZX Spectrum Skins."

LineageOS,felrkga,t3_cl1ci3,1579229198.0,"I'm looking to migrate from an Iphone to a usable Android phone that supports LineageOS.

Size doesn't matter too much, just being able to fit in my pocket is fine (Coming from the fairly large Iphone 6S)

Carrier is Sprint and Country is the United States
Money is fairly tight, I'd say around 100-200 is my budget, if it's a little pricier then I can save up.

For Storage I'd like it to be fairly usable, current phone is 64 Gigabytes though I don't use up anywhere near that currently, so if it's 32 then that's not a dealbreaker.

I take a lot of pictures so a fairly decent camera would be good.

Being able to use LTE/WiFi/Take Calls are the most important features, I don't play games or use apps like Facebook, Snapchat or anything like that, being able to use Discord/Signal/Authy/Email and Riot.im would be nice but those are usable on desktop so those are generally optional. Longevity is an important factor though, since money is tight I can't buy a new phone every year, so a phone that can last would be preferred. Same with the battery, a decently long battery life would be nice too.

Headphone Jack would also be nice but not mandatory."

retsupurae,feeusc9,t1_feenfld,1579041666.0,"I've got a few downloaded, only large set i'm missing, apart from the weird individual cases, are large series longplays. I've got most of the LP videos downloaded though, which include the Billy videos."
retsupurae,feeuops,t1_feeqaf8,1579041604.0,"Yup, Some of them are still in the original channel since they must have missed some, but I downloaded those reuploads too just in case."
retsupurae,fee4kla,t1_fecgvs9,1579026262.0,Yeah that's the idea. I've got a few playlists so far but it's still got a lot to go.

buildapc,fe356er,t1_fe2guv4,1578846047.0,Any decent recommendations for an MB? I'm looking through PC Part Picker right now but I'm still not sure what I should be looking out for.
emulation,fe2gt0x,t3_ekpvts,1578838191.0,"I'm looking to upgrade my PC to run stronger emulators like CEMU, for a long time Intel was the better option for running most of them, is that still the case or is Ryzen good for it now?"
buildapc,fe2gn79,t1_fe0uei1,1578838121.0,"Wanting to make sure I have a fair amount of space to work with, to avoid nasty cllutter.

I did look at Ryzen but that's not compatible with that particular motherboard, still trying to look for a good MB, those are the most difficult to replace so I want to be certain the Board and CPU are solid."
buildapc,fe03mrb,t1_fe00dl3,1578802237.0,"Any advice for the motherboard? When I check the ryzen 3600 it says it's not compatible, MB and CPU are the most difficult to replace so I want to make sure those are spot on."
depression,fcj8qf0,t3_eh1hgi,1577680107.0,"Oh absolutely every day, People usually abandon me because of all the problems i have so i just accept the fact that i'll die completely alone, probably in a hole somewhere cause that's my lot in life."
depression,fchxfj4,t3_eh6o7b,1577655260.0,"I'm the same but for a different reason, my best friend died months back, we used to talk every day on Discord, so waking up and not seeing that little ping, or if it's happens then it just being some random server announcement, just crushes me inside. I've just completely fallen apart since then."

PiratedGames,fc7aty6,t3_eggtd8,1577502122.0,"Tmodloader with cheat sheet + HERO's mod is your best bet, TML has it's own DRM to lock out of non steam copies (So GOG and also cracks) but I've got a few cracked versions of TML if you need it."
Minecraft,fc6mho4,t1_fc6mews,1577484075.0,Anything specific I need to find? UWP has very weird file and folder formats so I'm not sure if I can just copy those and dump em where I need them to be or if I need something special.
