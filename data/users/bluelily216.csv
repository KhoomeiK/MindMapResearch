Congress members and even the president aren't actually paid that much but if they pass laws that give money to certain companies they can expect a cushy job once they leave office. So if you're helping pass a bill that gives $10 billion to Northrup Grumman once you leave office they'll have a job waiting for you where you make five times more than you ever have.

I looked everywhere, couldn't find what I was looking for and stood up to go inside. I turned around for some reason and there stood a man who had walked off the curb, into the street and was staring directly at me. For some reason my body told me to not look afraid, to make sure he knew I saw him. So I stood up as straight and tall as possible, looked him in the eye, and walked at a normal pace inside. Once inside I told my sister what happened and when we looked outside he was standing across the road looking at her front door. We called our brother and looked outside a few minutes later.
