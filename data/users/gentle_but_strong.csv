Endo,ff9k0pr,t1_ff9i0jq,1579714642.0,"Is the femmcycle a firm cup? I have to use the firmest cup on the market (Yuuki) because my pelvic floor muscles crush everything else, so my cup options are very limited."
Endo,ff9gjol,t1_ff9fwg1,1579712543.0,"I use cloth pads as well, I also bleed through those. 

Doubling up is the only way Iâ€™ve managed to somewhat contain the flow. Pads alone just spill off the sides and a cup alone just overflows. Sigh."
Endo,fenrqm8,t1_fenpf31,1579289802.0,"Wow, thanks for the info! I donâ€™t even have a credit card yet, so that sucks that it will affect my credit score already. 

From what you and other users have said, Iâ€™m going to save up as much as I can before the procedure. Maybe Iâ€™ll be able to pay off half upfront."
pussy,fdzxr5o,t1_fdzxp7y,1578798380.0,Thank you! I thought so too ðŸ˜Š
bipolar,fdidq2f,t1_fdhoe7d,1578440577.0,The tiredness goes away after a few weeks!
bipolar,fdidnlh,t3_elf0sh,1578440532.0,I fucking loved Vraylar. But it gave me blurry vision and I couldnâ€™t drive anymore. Currently unmedicated...yippee
sex,fdh41nn,t3_ekzh03,1578414920.0,"I have a question. Ive been with a really caring and patient partner for a year and a half now and still havenâ€™t been able to orgasm. I can get myself off, but not in front of him. Itâ€™s really frustrating and I just want to fix it. Do you have any advice for this? 

I really resonated with your post and am so glad youâ€™ve achieved sexual satisfaction and comfort. I hope to do the same."
sex,fdgyzsk,t1_fdgvqmm,1578411744.0,Hearing that thereâ€™s no such thing puts my mind at great ease. Thank you.
sex,fdgyyqb,t1_fdgu3mp,1578411725.0,I think youâ€™re right. Now my focus is so set on having an orgasm that itâ€™s creating anxiety and preventing it from happening. Iâ€™ve never been able to orgasm in front of/with a partner (while sober at least) so thatâ€™s never really been an option. Thank you.
sticknpokes,fczi15k,t3_ejosfg,1578101699.0,What part of the body is this? Iâ€™ve been trying to guess for longer than Iâ€™d like to admit.
bodymods,fcw3iov,t3_ej44vh,1578016306.0,What is that tattoo under your ear? Iâ€™m intrigued!
AgeGap,fcue43z,t3_eiz27g,1577978800.0,"Just as another commenter said - if heâ€™s leaving a marriage for another relationship, what makes you think your relationship will be any more secure?"
endometriosis,fcud3kg,t3_eixwf7,1577978140.0,"If youâ€™re in this much pain and the ibuprofen isnâ€™t helping, please tell your doctor. It is their responsibility to treat pain and they should give you something stronger if they can. 

Iâ€™ve never had the lap procedure so Iâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t further help you. I wish you luck and hope things start to feel better soon."
endometriosis,fcu9vpo,t3_eisx6w,1577975999.0,Wait which pills can help while ovulating? Sounds like something I need
Endo,fcqthl3,t1_fcqszpd,1577891955.0,"Wow, Iâ€™ve never even heard of it and it seems to be a great option. Not sure why my doctor hasnâ€™t suggested it yet. Thank you so much!"
endometriosis,fcackxi,t1_fca7bqa,1577566798.0,"Thanks for your input. Iâ€™m so sorry to hear about the struggles, pain and procedures youâ€™ve been through due to your conditions. I hope good health finds you well, and soon."
endometriosis,fca1ar6,t1_fc9uyr5,1577561429.0,"Thank you so much, that gives me hope. I fill up a menstrual cup in less than two hours so I understand how tiring and annoying it is. Congratulations on your pregnancy!!"
endometriosis,fc9oe47,t1_fc9jbsz,1577555732.0,"I believe you take three every day of your period (canâ€™t remember exactly, donâ€™t have the directions in front of me)."
