The first step to recovery is mechanical eating, because we have messed with our digestive system and our interpretation  of signals from our body is also very messed up. Once you’ve normalized your intake and output then you focus on listening to your body. 

Because believe me, currently my body does not receive these cues at all"

fatlogic,ffc4k05,t3_esqqw3,1579791360.0,"I mean really unless you know the person well, commenting on their weight, loss or gain, good or bad is not a great idea. If you know a friend is intentionally trying to lose weight then sure, encourage them for their hard work.  But honestly it’s weird to comment on a stranger’s body. I’m not saying complimenting weight loss is bad, just be careful about who you’re talking to is all."
