Things that helped me feel more comfortable:

\- found a farm close enough to home that I could drive / have car on site for instant escape if I don't like it. In the same vein, I didnt agree to a huge long stay right out the gate. I looked for a month or less stays.

\- check for social media, websites, youtube etc to try to get an image of the farm im staying at

\- talked to host farmer on phone and had a clear idea of the social vibe of the farm. He was a college instructor before farming so I thought that was probably a jackpot temperament to have for teaching a newbie. I wanted my own bedroom outside of the host farmers house to have a little alone time so I looked for that.

\- took my mace / pepper spray. Whatever weapon you feel most comfy with.

\- I found out after the fact that the farm I was on ran background checks on wwoofers. I think in the future I may ask about this because it was very nice to have. The owner had some stories about some colorful characters that had come through before the background check and I would not have wanted to share a trailer with any of them. The trailer-mate I did have was chill/polite and not too noisy or messy considering he was a 24 yr old guy.

systematic racism doesn't excuse more systematic racism. 'revenge racism' will only beget more. again, im sad to see this on the avatar subreddit."

>Water  tribe based off of Native Americans/indigenous. Earth Kingdom is based  off China. Especially with the King and Queen ruling the Earth Kingdom  and showing how Earth kingdom was a mess until Kuvira came and she  basically Mao Zho doug( I forgot how spell that guy name sorry). But  instead of communism, Kuvira was fascist and was willing to united the  Earth Kingdom by forced and modernized it. Fire nation is based off of  Japan. In ATLB it was imperialist Fire nation who like Imperialist Japan  from ww1 and ww2. Air nation is based off of Tibet and Nepal. You see  there no white or black in the show. Diversity is good thing but it  doesnt fit for some live action shows/movie.

you could take this and flip it to be about medieval settings only needing white people and it'd fit just fine where i described."

worldnews,febiwty,t1_febeu3n,1578959293.0,This logic breaks down pretty fast when people get rich enough to write whatever laws are beneficial to them. Look up 'oligarchy' cause thats what America is these days
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,febi4ig,t1_feaiuq6,1578959061.0,dunno but only a tiny percentage are convicted of a crime so might as well keep shooting till they retire you

TheLastAirbender,feb8d54,t3_eo9lo2,1578956338.0,"Its sad to watch the avatar fandom make the same arguments that white nationalists have made to keep diversity out of video games. That it's somehow 'historically inaccurate' to have a white or black person in an imaginary land with airbenders and flying bison. SMH.

SandersForPresident,fe9jgfh,t3_eo5o4i,1578938168.0,Its not so much any one policy - its the integrity that is shown in his own actions. I suppose the practice of refusing to accept corporate PAC money and the consistency of his positions is what has won me. Maybe file this under 'money out of politics'
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fe9j5qw,t3_eo5tqt,1578937987.0,"I was walking a few nights ago (actually weeks ago now) and I noticed a guy who was chilling by a fence peeled off and started following me after I passed him. As I started walking across a narrow bridge to the greenbelt near my house he was gaining on me and was walking right behind me. When I reached the end of the bridge I turned sharply to let him continue on, but he turned sharply too.

At this point I gave my dog some extra leash and let him jump/growl at the guy - he looks small but c[attle dogs know how to intimidate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_oYdBegiK4) He looked shocked and turned away and then carried off in the OPPOSITE direction. So, something sketchy was up for sure. I was annoyed after that I had given him so much leeway thinking he might just be walking at night and not noticing me. They fucking notice what theyre doing."
