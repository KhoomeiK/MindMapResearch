I have never worked for a company that dumped the shit on the road or allowed pipe to be hauled anywhere but a cleaner for descaling and then to a dump that accepts radioactive material.

nyc,fffhyc2,t1_fffhi3y,1579884355.0,"Im talking about a deeper issue. A pre-curser to bigger crime. A sociological issue. Not 100% accurate but an indicator of the health of the ""rule of law"" in a certain place.

If people are emboldened enough to spray paint busses, trains, walls etc. that is a sign they are relatively unafraid of the consequences. Those people may never escalate. But if they are feeling emboldened what about the true criminals? What is there level of confidence they wont be caught? There is no real way to measure this but seeing things like a girl being murdered for her cellphone in a park by a bunch of early teenagers is also a sign.

Those kids had robbed before and it escalated to murder eventually. They felt safe in their spot that they wouldnt be caught while robbing people. Then it escalated to murder.

I am not saying the city goes to hell every time someone buys a can of spray paint. I am saying it is a possible indicator for things to come if it is ignored.

We already know what NYC was like in the 70s and 80s. Shit even through the 90s some parts of manhattan were infested with hookers and drug dealers. I dont want to back slide just because ""nah man graffiti is such a small crime it doesnt deserve any attention""."
