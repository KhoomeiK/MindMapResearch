Another principle that I think people get wrong: there's no reason to make yourself miserable for a year or two to pay off your loans, only to have way more money than you know what to do with. The best way to optimize happiness is ""consumption smoothing"" - that doesn't mean ratchet up your lifestyle to 11 now, but if you're going to be relatively comfortable in the future, you should be relatively comfortable now. Heck, it'll probably make you a better worker and more likely to move up in your career."

discgolf,fdfsmic,t3_ekzdnv,1578369195.0,"So from what I understand (I could be wrong), the spin of a disc has two impacts: first, at higher speeds, it causes the wake behind the disc to push a RHBH to the right (the turn). Then at lower speeds, the effect Danny was talking about comes in and the disc fades. I didn't hear anything in that video about the impact of spin on the amount of turn a disc gets, but I feel like that could be the explanation for why the FH doesn't turn as much?"

Non-zero-sum games are everywhere but once you're in a ""game"" mode you tend to think of competitive scenarios, which are often zero-sum. Another good example is the Prisoner's Dilemma, which you should look up but it's a situation where two people cooperating can both do better for themselves. 

Something not to get hung up on is that the zero-sum nature of a game is defined within the scope of the game. We're not considering whether society wants the potential prisoners in jail - the win/lose in the PD is entirely defined by the number of jail years, with less being good."
