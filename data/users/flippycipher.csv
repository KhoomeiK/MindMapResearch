funny,ffdf07d,t3_esr01a,1579819490.0,"Fuck the Royal family. Being dictated what you can and can't do, who you can and can't marry, and how you live your life, should not be a thing in the 21st century. It's too controlling and restrictive, especially when they're born in to it and had no choice from the start. Don't want children? Don't want to marry that guy/gal? Well tough shit you're a royal and you must procreate. For the rest of society, having old grandma dictate your life would be considered controlling and inappropriate behaviour, but in the royal family it's somehow ok? And don't get me started about the whole Pedo Andrew scandal, and how he gets covered up and protected just because he's a royal. If Andrew was a regular average joe he would have been exposed years ago. 

The whole royal nonsense just sounds like a milder Sharia Law but with no beatings. Honestly the Royal Family is pointless, outdated and obsolete. And what's with the paparazzi? Who even cares? Give them the privacy that everyone else deserves!"

facepalm,femyuhk,t3_epwmlf,1579273101.0,"There's this youtuber called turdflingingmonkey, and in one of his videos (called ""shh mommy's sleeping"" or something like that), he talked about how putting women into comas and raping them should be an idea for society to consider. He seemed pretty serious about it too, and his whole channel is basically just complaining about how terrible women are, and saying that they are all sluts who should have their rights taken away.
