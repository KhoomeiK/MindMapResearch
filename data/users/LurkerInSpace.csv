The fact that Trident is the biggest item that gets brought up when addressing reveals how little slack there is to cut.

That isn't to say this is the best way forward; the EU only works because no one country has ever been big enough to totally dominate it - when it was founded France, West Germany and Italy were all roughly the same size economically.

>  In America [liberal is] used as a broad catch-all for the political left, whereas anywhere else in the world a liberal party would generally be one in either the centre or the right.

i.e. Outside of the USA it doesn't mean being on the left at all. The only reason it's used this way in America is because there are only two viable parties there, and the more left wing party happens to be a liberal one. In Australia it's the opposite.

In France Macron's liberal En Marche party is opposed by three socialist parties and by the various right wing parties. In Germany the liberal FDP is opposed by the conservative CDU on the right and the Social Democratic Party and the Greens (who are on the left). Italy's 5 Star Movement is a populist liberal party which is likewise flanked by the left and right but is part of neither. In each of these cases they occupy the centre and don't overlap with the left the way the socialists and social democrats do with each other.

Liberals and socialists generally oppose each other in the rest of the world."

That completely misses what's wrong with those countries. Some of them were even governed by explicitly socialist parties and still had the same problems - others have ideologies which don't fit on that spectrum at all.

The fundamental problem in these countries is that the government isn't dependent on the people for its main source of revenue and so doesn't give a shit about them - it can pay its key supporters and stay in power with money from either natural resources, foreign aid or even just borrowing with no intention of paying it back.

In that context it doesn't matter if the country is capitalist, socialist, or feudal; the problem is in how the government supports itself.

> ""no sorry we can't help you because the governor of your state is corrupt""

For a sovereign country this is an actual problem though. For exampe, in Myanmar following the 2008 cyclone, General Than Shwe ensured that foreign aid had to be directed through him, and was given to his supporters to sell on the black market at a profit. If the governor of an American state tried that he could simply be arrested; such a thing is more complicated against a foreign military junta."

In America it's used as a broad catch-all for the political left, whereas anywhere else in the world a liberal party would generally be one in either the centre or the right.

The Canadian Liberals, for example, compete against the left wing NDP and take a centrist position. The British Liberal Democrats are to the right of the socialist/social democratic (depending on who's in charge) Labour party - the main opposition. The Australian Liberals are firmly on the right.

Liberalism and socialism are opposed to each other; the reason they sometimes work together in America is simply because America's two-party system is firmly entrenched."

MapPorn,fehczz7,t1_feh6s7w,1579114018.0,"That's one type of gerrymandering, but not the only one. The more general definition is: redrawing political boundaries to effect a particular result.

For example; one can draw maps which produce only safe seats for *both parties*. This is essentially what has happened in North Carolina recently; the previous map was considered a Republican gerrymander, so they made a deal which gave the Democratic Party two more seats, and made all seats on the new map extremely safe.

One can also do the opposite and gerrymander for extremely competitive elections, but this generally isn't done since neither party really likes the risk that comes with that.

Finally, one can gerrymander to try to get a result which matches the proportions people voted for each party (good luck doing this in a 3+ party system). This is effectively a mild gerrymander in favour of the Democratic party, since a map drawn only considering population tends to slightly benefit the Republican party due to the distribution of each party's voters."

A Martian colony would need to be enclosed, but it fills an economic niche because of the abundance of resources and its low gravity well.

The more rocket components it could make itself the more profitably it could do this.

When such a colony has grown sufficiently into a country in its own right (by which point it will have enclosed plenty of land), *then* it would consider the difficult challenge of terraforming its planet (which is still much easier than finding another one like Earth)."

The latter seems like the more complicated problem to deal with."
