Luckily I saw him before he saw me and I snuck back out. I was disappointed as I really wanted to try that place but like fuck I was going to chance a forced conversation with that dickwad.

awardtravel,ff87p3h,t3_es3403,1579668373.0,"I wonder why they wouldn’t let you carry on if you’re silver or better. One other thing about silver or better is when you check your bag they should put a priority tag on it which should make it come out the claim belt first. Doesn’t always happen but most times it does, can save a lot of time. Pay attention this year tho, United has changed their premier earning system so it may effect how you’ll be able to get silver or not for next year. 

At $400 I’d do it. I am gold and we got offered my wife to buy silver at like $1100 one time and I almost did it. 

But as other posters said, if you’re only concerned about a free bag I’d go with the credit card."

AskThe_Donald,fen37nu,t1_fem7jy5,1579275970.0,"Yeah but like, it’s used to make an example you wiener. 

I have apartments that are rented to section 8 where the tenants pay SIX dollars a month and the state pays the the other $594. We have one guy who pays ZERO, he got a voucher for 12 months rent. I go over to fix something and these fuckers are laying on the couch asleep at 2 in the afternoon. Not a day off, not a lunch break, straight up not working. They all smoke, they all have giant flat screen TVs, they all have multiple gaming consoles. Most are overweight. A lot of the time they have pets. 

It’s not everyone all the time but is a lot more people than it should be. If you’re able bodied and on some kind of assistance you should have to re apply quarterly. The trouble is a lot of these people are never called to the carpet so they just keep getting housing vouchers, EBT cards, free babysitting services. You name it, if someone knows the system they can get by pretty good on govt handouts.

But please, tell me, someone who deals with it daily, how that isn’t true."
