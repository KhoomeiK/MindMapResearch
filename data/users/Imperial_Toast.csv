aww,fehpi26,t1_feh2f4g,1579121280.0,"The original date of completion was set for March 03 2019. Unfortunately a clerical error occurred that caused the completion date to be set as March 03 2091. In further unfortunate news, the amount of time to correct clerical errors of this fashion and magnitude is between 540-780 months, so it is a distinct possibility that we could see the construction complete in 2061, but that‚Äôs a hopeful estimate."

Then a hugely popular podcast, made of comedians and based on finding videos of wild shit on the internet, features him. The podcast hosts make jokes at his expense, sell merch based on slogans that were never copywritten, compensate him, interview him (which he voluntarily participates in), and then he gets mad. I'm sorry, but I don't see any issues here. Keep it high n tight in 2020 jeans!"
