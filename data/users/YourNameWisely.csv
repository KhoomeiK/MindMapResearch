AskVegans,fcxpxdh,t3_ejhiqg,1578068685.0,"Dairy is equally bad for your health. I recommend watching What The Health (itâ€™s on Netflix). They talk more about the ill effect of dairy.

Itâ€™s great youâ€™re considering going vegan by the way, your health will definitely improve and as a bonus youâ€™ll make a positive change for the world!"

WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fc3mlut,t1_fc34mlv,1577393312.0,I tested it and youâ€™re right. I think the cat is trying to tell us heâ€™s the reincarnation of Michael Jackson. Wouldnâ€™t be surprised if his name was Shamone.
autism,fc2mwll,t1_fc2mn3i,1577367546.0,"Wat een mooi doel! 

Wij â€˜kregenâ€™ de hond toen onze zoon al 9 was en nog niet wist dat hij autistisch was. Het was dus eerst een buddyhond. Na de diagnose kreeg Kirza de titel autismegeleidehond. 

Bij mijn weten blijft de hond altijd zijn hele werkzame leven bij Ã©Ã©n gezin of persoon. Na zijn of haar pensioenleeftijd kan de hond worden geadopteerd door de eigenaar, of zoekt het KNGF een andere plek."
autism,fc2j947,t1_fc2iucv,1577363118.0,My partner is on the spectrum. I am the only neurotypical person in our family. So in our family I am the atypical one :-)
autism,fc2a97t,t1_fc28ty1,1577348253.0,"It is not necessarily an autism thing. For my son it is one of the ways his autism shows. If he canâ€™t read all the signs he gets really upset. Itâ€™s something he HAS to do. 

But: I am not autistic, yet I do share a lot of characteristics with my son. Itâ€™s only autism if you have all the characteristics.

I once read a comparison with the color spectrum. Autism means you have all the colors, in different grades (so e.g. a bit of orange, and a lot of red). Neurotypical people can have purple and Blue, but unless they have every color it isnâ€™t autism."
autism,fc1yzkb,t1_fc1hhjw,1577334180.0,Het is een museum in Stockholm. Maar: hulp- en geleidehonden mogen in vrijwel alle musea naar binnen. Ook in Nederland.
dogswithjobs,fc150i5,t1_fc11fpq,1577308439.0,"Something like: having autism means either not being able to do anything at all, or be a genius. I have no idea why they removed the account. Their idea on autism may have been flawed, but I live by the rule that thereâ€™s no such thing as a stupid question. I hope no one sent them an angry message :("
dogswithjobs,fc14meq,t1_fc13liz,1577308123.0,"I donâ€™t  remember exactly , but someone asked about the nature of my sonsâ€™ autism. I donâ€™t know why they removed it!"
autism,fc14jn3,t1_fc13x30,1577308058.0,"Our son was tentative around dogs as well. But his dog helped him understand dogs, and now he wants to become a dog trainer (at weekends, on weekdays he wants to be a scientist). So I wouldnâ€™t let that stop you necessarily. We did go for a special, trained support dog, mainly because we wanted to know the character of the dog. 

Having a dog can be truly helpful for ASS.  The dog is a true loyal and forgiving friend in a world where thatâ€™s unfortunately a scarce thing. But itâ€™s a lot of work for the parent. The dog deserves long walks, and thatâ€™s the parentsâ€™ task. If youâ€™re up to that, I would say go for it!"
autism,fc12y89,t1_fc12gjx,1577306752.0,"Wij ook niet! Maar onze zoon (Aspergerâ€™s) heeft er zo veel baat bij. Het is een trouwe, voorspelbare vriend die hem op de juiste momenten uitdaagt om net een stap extra te zetten. Onze zoon had een rolstoel nodig voor we de hond hadden (o.a. omdat overprikkeldheid zich bij hem uit in pijn) en nu gebruiken we deze bijna nooit meer. Lang leve het KNGF!"

It was the Nordiska Museet in Stockholm. My son and his dog now know all there is to know about the shrinking arctic!"
dogswithjobs,fc0qj17,t1_fc0q52c,1577297217.0,I am like that with my husband Iâ€™m afraid. But itâ€™s also one of the things that makes him special. I am just soooo very impatient ðŸ˜‚
dogswithjobs,fc0p685,t1_fc0gtj5,1577296351.0,"My son gets very disturbed if he canâ€™t read and see everything. I hope he finds someone who cherishes that as something positive, just like your partner does"
dogswithjobs,fc0omi1,t1_fc0nnlj,1577295967.0,"Our son is something in between. He has a high IQ (+145) but struggles with a lot of things like social behavior. He has zero to no friends. He is also very sensitive to tactile stimulation, meaning he often has a lot of pain. His support dogs is both a friend and a distraction from the pain. She is a godsend!"

dogswithjobs,fbx8x9w,t1_fbx85zo,1577174763.0,"Oh no, itâ€™s not that easy! There are dedicated organizations with long waiting lists and strict rules. Only they can provide official dogs."
dogswithjobs,fbx83vj,t1_fbx80vi,1577173618.0,"It was free of charge, and she was allowed to be with us at all times, definitely one of the perks of having a support dog!"
dogswithjobs,fbx7mdp,t1_fbw5fi0,1577172961.0,She had to sit at our feet. There was very little space but she just curled up and slept all flight. She did really well!
