oddlysatisfying,ffasj79,t3_escb2f,1579743484.0,So I’ve never seen this sport before and I’m very confused; can someone who is British explain?
entertainment,ffad9bl,t1_ff3e4vd,1579732821.0,Very true; animation in the west I think is still seen as content for children.
TrollYChromosome,ff6f7ll,t3_erptjr,1579625888.0,Mark Dice isn’t relevant anymore.

socialskills,ff3dfx9,t3_erb2rz,1579538895.0,"Wow, this post is exactly how I feel right now. I’ve been having a habit in the past few years of burning bridges and therefore I lose connection with many friends and potential employers. This leads me to not even bothering with being around people or trying to be a positive role model anymore.

Would appreciate every bit of advice given here as well."

entertainment,ff08h9l,t1_ff07hpr,1579466282.0,"I’ve been watching a lot of anime lately and other animated content more frequently than live action stuff, so I’m biased towards one medium than the other; it just seems something like the dark tower series would be better executed with animation, especially since I hear the live action attempt failed.

Then again, the Mandalorian is practically flawless, so perhaps I’m wrong. Animation seems to solve a lot more challenges, especially when action is involved, so that love action actors don’t have to rely on stunt doubles or a lot of practical effects to be used."
