unOrdinary,ffh14ma,t1_ffh10fr,1579920312.0,also... username checks out :)
unOrdinary,ffh0kkt,t1_ffgzlqm,1579919884.0,i see.. btw i like how u explained ur point without downvoting and criticizing me for not siding with john. :)
unOrdinary,ffgudbq,t3_et7uwr,1579915293.0,rly want sera to talk to william to find out the truth. cuz sera aint gonna get shit outta john. :(
unOrdinary,ffgu49z,t3_etcd3h,1579915108.0,"ikr same. i just read the fastpass spoilers here. for all the ppl who says its ptsd. i dont cate. thats not an excuse to continue to lie to someone you see as your """"best friend"". if u continue to keep them in the dark when they ask... ur not their ""best friend"". its not how friendships work.

though i will admit sera rly should b confronting john more.. although i side with her, its kinda annoying how she ignores john instead of goes up to him telling him that she knows for a fact hes joker and ask him why hes doing what hes doing.

will resubscribe when sera and john have a real talk."
unOrdinary,ffc9zpk,t1_ffbcjnk,1579794911.0,"i totally agree, esp with seras part"
unOrdinary,ffb5nn4,t1_ffb58t8,1579752448.0,yep this is gonna take a while... i wont be reading it until they have a heart to heart..
unOrdinary,ffb2xo7,t1_ffb1v4k,1579750444.0,yep. im coming back when sera and john have a heart to heart and not a moment b 4  good thing these spoilers r here so i know exactly when to re subscribe
unOrdinary,ffb2u5t,t1_ffb1xcm,1579750376.0,well thats cuz he keeps lying to sera. thats not gonna help him much. sera already doubts him. if he doesnt come clean its just not gonna go well for him. Sera deserves to know the truth. best friends dont lie to each other. though i will say that sera rly needs to go ASK john. rn neither one is communicating to one another.
unOrdinary,ffb2n4p,t1_ffazqky,1579750241.0,i've been unsubscribed for months cuz its not going in a direction that interests me. i always read the fastpass spoilers here and up til now i was about to resubscribe BUT it seems like john is being shady again... i literally just want john to man up and tell sera the truth and until that happens im just not gonna read it
unOrdinary,ff3iszz,t3_erfw9b,1579541945.0,sera vs john if that becomes a thing.. or sera vs arlos barrier. that was hella badass
Awwducational,ff3do3v,t1_ff32lrm,1579539012.0,it was the tall thin human wearing blue shirt walking slowly across the colony with a gun!

CharacterDevelopment,fezpk78,t1_fezopus,1579460055.0,"sounds interesting! who would the antagonists be? since they are in the army, would the antagonists be a country they are at war with? or will there be a conspiracy like in fmab and the antagonist is someone from within?"
CharacterDevelopment,fezf9d2,t1_fezdvav,1579456733.0,"haha thank you! as you know i am still plotting and one of the hardest things to do is to pace each character's arc and figure out where they run into each other but they will all definitely run into each other many times... i have many many points where one or a few of the characters meet up together to accomplish something but i am also still worldbuilding and figuring out what else the characters could do :D

well its not really inspired by the matrix.. but i have watched it before :)

Thank you! and i hope you can reach your goal and publish your comic too!

And what does your art look like?

what is your comic about? who are your main characters and what do they do?"
