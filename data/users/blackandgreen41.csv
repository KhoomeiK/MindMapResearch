Most of us are carrying cell phones and our bosses are calling us at all hours as needed and weekends. 

Plus, let's not exaggerate the teacher's plight to an absurd level. We wall went to school as children. Teachers are not grading papers at home unless they are as dumb as a bag of rocks. They are grading papers during their work period, during lunch, or during class time when they assign out work for the class to do. 

The teacher that lives next door to me laughs at people doing grading at home. She has never done that. She always has the class read some shit and answer questions or work problems quietly while she uses class time to grade. All of my teachers did that.

Teachers don't even average 40 hour weeks when you count their summer vacation and other ridiculous days off.They are only working 180 days a year. The rest of us are doing 300.

You have your numbers wrong. Most gun related deaths are suicides, not accidents. Only some are accidents, and any gun enthusiast will tell you that they doubt most ""accidents"" because of the circumstances reported. For example, my neighbor apparently ""accidentally"" shot himself in the temple with a 9mm. His family cannot bear the thought of a suicide, and the police have joined them in this bullshit story about an ""accident."" This guy had 30 guns and was quite skilled with them. I doubt he pointed a loaded weapon at himself on ""accident"", especially since he was taking anti-depressants and reported that he often felt nihilistic and unappreciated."

centrist,ff8r6c0,t3_esa75t,1579692751.0,"There is no evidence that increasing a particular person's pay results in better service. 

There is evidence that increasing the pay offered for a job attracts more people to the job and gives you a larger pool from which to higher ""better"" people. 

This is also the argument against raising teacher wages. Teachers argue that they should get paid more, but they get summers off, work relatively short hours compared to private sector people at the same income, and have less exposure to financial risk. They also have higher job protection. 

Offering teachers higher pay doesn't improve teaching quality, because the current crop of teachers is one of the variables causing low quality teaching. Increasing teacher pay would only be effective if you were able to offer the higher pay, interview from the new pool of smarter, better-looking people that applied, and then fired any teachers that were lower quality than the new candidates you identified. IOW, you have to fire the current teachers and hire new ones attracted by the higher pay to get any benefit.

There is also no evidence that raising teacher pay will silence the bitter, endless complaining of teachers about their pay. They've been complaining since the 1980's, and they will never stop. But the truth is that they voluntarily and knowingly went into a low-paid profession not for money but for a purpose driven life.

Unfortunately for them and us, they cannot have a purpose-driven life working from state and national standards within the walls of a government bureaucracy, so they become disenchanted quickly, bitter, and have extremely high attrition into other jobs.

Teachers do not migrate into high paying jobs, though, because generally they were never going to be highly-paid people. They aren't corporate executive material nor entrepreneurs - its one f the things that attracted them to teaching in the first place.

TL;DR: Raising wages only raises service levels when the higher wages are used to replace current shitty workers with new, better workers. People don't get ""better."" People do not really change."

centrist,ff4yaoy,t3_erl6rf,1579575366.0,"My take on it is that gun control is a stupid left-wing talking point that distracts from actual national problems that are never addressed. For me, gun control is easily dismissed as being worthy of my time:

* Most gun deaths are suicides - and suicide is a separate issue from ""gun violence"" where one individual violates another's right to life/liberty
* Some other percentage of gun deaths are caused by law enforcement and self-defense.
* The genie is out of the bottle, and since gun confiscation is not an option, any laws will just be a bunch of showboating for the politically naive. Police will not enforce gun bans or gun confiscation, and few Americans will tolerate such a thing. Americans will not surrender the weapons voluntarily as they are an artifact of identity. 

Thus, all laws on the topic are a waste of time, solve a minor issue, and fail to address the issue of suicide. Plus, trying to deny guns to ""crazy people"" just results in a police state where an incompetent federal agency gets access to everyone's medical and psychological history. so much for privacy.

Gun control is never going to happen, and even if it does, it is a total waste of time.

I recommend our federal government concern itself with other planks in their platforms:

* Health care cost control
* College cost control for public colleges
* Revenue/spend imbalances in US fiscal policy
* Excessive military spending
* Inadequate and/or terrible veterans benefits and programs

But no, sure, let's keep focusing on gun laws that will never be enforced, will provide zero results, and will not be obeyed."

Many centrists hold various positions all over the spectrum, but they add up to centrism in general. That's generally how one ends up a centrist rather than a moderate. A moderate is an ideologue near the center.

I can't imagine the American reaction to a president saying ""Oh yeah, the Pentagon was blown up, but we're going to send in a diplomatic team and meet all of our enemy's demands.""

Dude, it's terrorism."
PublicFreakout,fdakltg,t1_fdaa3s0,1578247092.0,"> ome experts do suspect that some historical figures like Einstein, Newton and Mozart were autistic.

No experts believe this. Jenny McCarthy and some therapists believe it. Therapists are experts in dealing with mental problems, but they are not researchers nor scientists any more than medical doctors are. 

No researcher who wanted to retain his credentials among his peers would ever speculate about something like that, as diagnosis is quite impossible, and you cannot even come to a reasonable suspicion. It would be tantamount to speculating on what happened before the big bang. 

And as you have probably noticed, many people speculate about that, but no astrophysicist does. They just say ""We don't know."" 

Casting someone of amazing accomplishment like Franklin as autistic might make you feel better about your autistic kids or give them someone to look up to, but what about the other people who already looked up to that person who's reputation you are now shitting on for your personal feelings?

Autism is a social disability, and Ben Franklin was a social genius, not just an intellectual genius, as were all of the founding fathers. None of them were socially inept, avoiding eye contact, or otherwise having trouble making connections with each other. They were extremely social, as all people at the top of any company or governmental structure are.

This might not make people who are in autism support groups happy to hear, but anyone who has gotten up the corporate ladder knows that intellect has nothing to do with it. It is all charm after a point, and that's the disability that autistic people have."

None of the candidates talk about cost controls on health care or education. They just talk about pouring more money onto the ridiculous costs that already exist and enabling those who set the prices at ludicrous rates thanks to insurance/lobbying/industrial collusion.

None of them are talking about the wrong-headedness of political correctness run amok such that people on college campuses are literally advocating silencing those they disagree with.

None are discussing any tax plan that will bring in revenue from the wealthy from their stocks/bonds in concert with any plan to reform govt spending and introduce new discipline.

None of the democrats other than Tulsi Gabbard have uttered a word about foreign policy, and she's out.

The entire election is a shit show. Just hoping the DNC has learned its lesson and doesn't throw all of the super delegates to Biden and annoint him before the primaries have even concluded the way they did Hillary."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fd6yec8,t3_ejz5mc,1578197251.0,"Pretty sure that's illegal in every state. You can't self-enforce ""no trespassing"" signs. You have to call the sheriff or the police to enforce them for you to arrest someone. You also cannot leave a trap for a human or an animal like that which detonates or fires off. The land owner is probably in deep trouble even if the guy was trespassing.

Not saying people don't ignore the signs sometimes, but doing this is unethical AF. If it was a video of a four year old kid having that explosion go off on them in the woods, reddit would be calling for the land owner's head."
PublicFreakout,fd3cmm2,t1_fcy9y8p,1578156901.0,"Whoa there, mom. While the sentiment is appreciated, there is zero evidence that Einstein, or Newton had autism, and no professional researcher would agree we can diagnose someone with autism after they are dead using limited memories, journals, and rumors. Ben Franklin's known behavior doesn't point to it either. He was insanely social and popular - so much so he was our ambassador to France during the Revolution. He ran social organizations. He was charming and highly people-oriented as well as being a genius. The founding fathers clustered around his genius as well as his charm. 

Let's not start inventing a lot of autistic people in history. Your kids can be just as successful in life without you buying into this ""All these famous people are autistic"" nonsense."
