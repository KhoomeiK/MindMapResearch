Pessimism,ffwf01f,t1_ffue56b,1580298515.0,What I like the most is that whatever is life or living things... one thing is common: its entropy is negative at the expense of the rest of the universe... fascinating... to me.

hamburg,ffq7tvw,t1_ffq74rd,1580125009.0,"I probably hit wall very quickly like:
- Hey! hallo, wie get's?
- Mir es gut! und du?
- Na, auch gut!
- (awkward silence)...
- (probably you try to talk to me, me what? er... say it again?)
- (then I just diffuse the situation with some stupid joke) ""Ich hasse Brenda. Habe mir die Hosen gepinkelt"".
- (maybe you laugh out of pity... done. nothing else happens because I'm too stupid to keep a conversation let alone in german).

Don't get me wrong, i will look for this conversation/you once I'm able to speak more.
In other words, I totally appreciate it! let's keep in touch."
