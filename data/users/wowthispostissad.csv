Interesting how none of the advice in here suggests becoming a better catch, how to build yourself, or how to identify and attract men who would treat you right in return. 

Think logically about this. Why would doing more of this behavior give you the results you want, if it’s never worked before? Wouldn’t doing more of the same thing give you back more of the same results? 

I’m assuming you want just one man. Why would doing this for more men give you what you want? You’ll get more of same thing back.. except more of it because you’ll be doing it for more men. On top of this, men negatively judge women for being with other men, so you’ll be in an even worse off place than before."
WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,ffkbrwz,t1_ffkbkfr,1580020182.0,I agree with 2. She’s doing something wrong. That’s why I suggested coming to fds. Continuing to do what she’s doing (as she stated) and putting men’s needs before hers will give her the same results she got before.

If I’m 36 then it’s already bad. If I’m 25 it will become bad because I won’t stay 25 forever. Either way, getting with a man like this means you lose no matter what.

I’m a woman with a stem degree from a top 5 uni in the world. Yes, world. And I currently work with more than 90% men and I am their boss. My graduating class was 1/3 women; I graduated around 10 years ago. Almost all of these women do not work in male dominated fields today. We were all very aware what was waiting for us in the working world before we graduated. Many women who are educated and ambitious do not want to work in fields where they will face extreme sexism. What’s the point in doing all that education only to be pushed down every step of the way because of your sex? 

The bar isn’t lowered overall for women. Maybe getting in as a junior engineer for your first job out of college, it can be more equal, depending where you live. But try to go beyond being at entry level, women face sexism all the way up. What’s the point of getting the entry level job just as well as men do if you aren’t allowed to move up because of men? Entry level lasts less than 5 years and a successful career will last decades. True in law, finance, engineering, construction, medical, etc. 

Women have been shouting this forever yet men still wanna play “it’s not sexism, it’s that women aren’t interested in these high paying, respected, dynamic, interesting careers as men are!” I’ve heard all those excuses before, many times. They’re all different versions of “women aren’t as capable or ambitious as men are.”

There are also tons of studies showing that women are generally just as interested in stem fields at first, but over time, leave due to the sexism. I wouldn’t recommend a woman pursue the path I did unless she’s extremely passionate about money and/or that specific field and has a certain type of grit. Otherwise she will not make it. 

We need “women in stem” clubs because otherwise we would be steamrolled by men completely and have no space for ourselves. Having one club doesn’t mean that now society is more accommodating towards women than men in stem. Because women get a specific crumb men don’t get (when they have almost the entire loaf), it’s all of a sudden more accommodating to women? That is ridiculous. 

Men need to accept the fact women have been improving over time and it’s starting to show. We are finally making it despite all the hurdles we face. Men haven’t improved much in the same time period. Instead of coming up with excuses for their hurt ego, learn from women and become better. Women were behind for the majority of history (and mostly due to male oppression).
