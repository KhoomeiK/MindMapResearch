cars,ffdg6g3,t1_ffdcwca,1579820192.0,"The ECU has the security coprocessor inside of it. It exists between it's storage and CPU and probably an IO bus. As far as the CPU is concerned it's talking to storage. If the security compressor cannot validate the firmware on its own, it will send a bootrom that's only purpose is to display to you ""your firmware is fucked, tow it to a dealer"" or perhaps immediately try and reset via OTA. 
Two signatures yes, no real way to read the per car key without chip invasion. First C8 has already been solid. Not sure on the timeline to dealers. 

Z06/ZR1 I think they tend to be harder to crack just because they come later in their development cycle, and they have some manueverability in changing the ECU. Don't think it's for any product reason."
cars,ffdc1q1,t1_ffdat6v,1579817676.0,"Probably not, but non OTA will still need to be signed and follow the same protocol as any other firmware update method. The reallll question is if the security coprocessors firmware will be patchable (usually yes) and what that will entail. People have been touting ECUs as uncrackable since the 90s but we are rappidly approaching a point where only national agencies will have the resources to do so for some manufacturers. BMW almost had it with the M5 ECU, but fucked up the chip design so there was a hardware exploit that required drilling into the DIP itself. That wouldn't happen if it's a general purpose security coprocessor instead of just a keystore module like what BMW was using."

This post is making the assumption they are even using security coprocessors. Knowing GM they will fuck it up somehow. But any OTA system is a major PITA for cracking anything. Companies that build chips for GM have released a lot of white papers on security coprocessors in busses which is why I think they will use it."
cars,ffd5u5i,t1_ffd2d48,1579814000.0,"I am talking about a firmware flash key (master OEM key), not on disk description key which is a UUID in the security coprocessot and different for every car. 

You are still thinking of the ECU has a single chip system and it shows. 

You are unable to validate a checksum on the ECU because it is never done on the ECU, just the security coprocessor.

You cannot load ANYTHING to the ECU without it going through the security coprocessor, as storage is real time encrypted and decrypted at run time. 

I am not going to speak about this anymore as it's clear you don't understand the purpose of a security coprocessor and how it interacts with over the air updates. 

If you can create a sustainable memory crack for any widely used security coprocessor that survives a reboot and an update, you have more than enough skills to break nearly any advanced hardware encryption out there, which thankfully, nobody has figured out yet.

Let me turn this into terms people who don't work on security chips might understand better. With iPhones. Which is going to have a lot more in common with it's bus framework than any vehicle bus outside of Tesla afaik. 

Old iPhones used to work like cars. Master signed firmware, UID encrypted user content. All encryption decryption lives on the main boot rom. 

New iPhones UID and Master key signed firmware (updates are device specific, so even a leak of a master key alone does not compromise the firmware) before the iPhone boots, the main processor memory is _partially_ decrypted by the security coprocessor. The keys never exist on the main processor. Before anything going into storage, or coming out of it, it's decrypted or encrypted by the coprocessor as well. 

I would reaserch how apple secure boot works and really try and understand it. It's much closer to how this framework is going to work on a module level. Not even taking into account the firmware level encryption that may or may not exist.

Basically what I am getting down to, is you cannot run anything on the CPU without the keys on the security coprocessor, because everything in storage (at the very minimum) is run through the coprocessor before the CPU. So in order to run anything on the CPU, you need the coprocessors keys. Which are really. Really really. Hard to get. And you would need to get them for each and every car you want to crack."
cars,ffd1b0q,t1_ffd0ijc,1579811456.0,"Let's say there is a leak, there can now be an OTA to reset the keys with a new one, and prohibit it working for new cars or they can be refreshed periodically making leaks have a short lifespan. AMG has direct access, but yes I assume there will be limited published keys for lingenfelter. Or perhaps they will have to request keys for individual cars, so a leak would be meaningless. 

There's also the threat of no Single Signature. Where there isn't a master key at all, and there is a key defined per car that is stored in what I assume a very difficult to leak database, that could also be refreshed.

Also with the huge investment into secure software and hardware, I am sure keys will be more locked down than before. Tesla hasn't had leaks of any major caliber yet.

Leaking Chevy's private OTA firmware signing key is a lot lot more damaging than an engineer leaking ECU decrypt keys.

Every single update has the ability to break a cracking method, much like jailbreaking."
cars,ffcz78w,t1_ffcxyh9,1579810288.0,"Unsure until it's out, probably at least as secure as Tesla's platform. It shared a lot in common with NXPs secure vehicle platform if you are interested they have a great white paper."
cars,ffcuann,t1_ffcqevo,1579807401.0,"They really don't need it (yet). Basically, you can be assured a company will be using a security coprocessor (unless they are dumb dumbs, looking at you Nissan) if the compute network is designed to allow for at least a couple of these things. 

- Full platform OTA updates (Mercedes only does this for infotainment in it's ICE cars)
- EV integration with central battery management 
- Eventual support for full self driving platform.

Mercedes does not use coprocessors and has been cracked. McLaren does not need any of that so why spend the money designing a secure infrastructure.

The reason GM is so security focused with this platform is it's supposed to last the next decade.

C7 Z06 ECU has been cracked for a while. Pretty much the same as any other ECU out right now (besides Tesla).

The fact that you included the British in that list made me actually laugh out loud."
cars,ffcn267,t1_ffcmu5z,1579802941.0,"The validation and decryption is happening on the security coprocessor. Information routed to other systems (storage in most cases, but could be an Ethernet bus in chevyland) is run through the coprocessor as well for NRT ecrypt decrypt. There is no unencrypted functions anywhere outside of the security coprocessor. I guarantee you have not worked with anything with a security coprocessor before. Unless you've tried to decrypt an iPhone (something three letter agencies have spent years trying to do).

The security model you are describing (single chip signatures) is what was used by early iPhones, and why they were jailbroken so fast."
cars,ffckmr8,t1_ffcgvwa,1579801473.0,"You are pretty far off yes, in cheap, old, or single chip systems (pretty much all ECUs up to this point), you are correct, keys were held in the boot sector of main program memory. 

Due to factory debugging, if you had pin access to the SOC you could then dump the rom, load it up in a hex editor and look for the correct keys length in the correct sector, the encryption schemes that could run on these simple controllers was also pretty basic in most cases. 

This is no longer the case. Encryption keys are no longer stored in main program memory but in a secure access coprocessor. There is no pin outs on these, and decryption is done on the coprocessor itself, so no intercepting those keys of a signal line either if you one hell of an oscilloscope. The secure access chip also verifies the signature of the entire program memory or it just won't even attempt to decrypt and boot at all. 

This has a lot in common with secure boot on computers with secure access silicon. As far as I know, without a manufacturer signed firmware package, there isn't a way to extract the base UID from a secure access chip without literally getting **physical** access to the memory bank and reading it one bit at a time with very precise, custom instruments, which I think countries have tried to do, unsure if it's ever been done successfully. 

Usually these chips are bundled on the same die as the main processor making things much much more difficult. Nearly necesitates silicon level access without a manufacturers signature. 

You are *way* more likely to destroy the chip than you are to read it, and youve just discovered the UID for a single access chip, and spent what I can imagine hundreds of thousands of dollars in custom hardware. I would not be surprised if their is more than one. 

The above is making the assumption that there isn't a *major* flaw in their security schemes. Which I think is unlikely given their outside consultation. There might be hacks that work for single cars, but a single OTA could stop it from working for forever.

All of this has to do with the integration of separate auto systems into a single network. OEMs now have a HUGE liability if people can mess with cars that have automatic emergency braking and OTA. They could mess with an EVs battery controller to turn of it's active cooling, ect.

ECU security in the past was always a stop gap for competitive reasons (much like video game piracy protections). Now it is absolutely mission critical to the platforms integrity. If there was a hardware flaw that lead people to be able to crack the master key (or it was leaked), I wouldn't expect Chevy to say ""dang"". They would recall every car that has the potential to be compromised if they cannot update it"

cars,ffb9fc7,t1_ffas5xz,1579756069.0,"Bruh if you think you can crack a 2020 OTA compatible ECU by hooking up JTAG like it's 2008 or it's a NRF52840 you are in for a bad time. OEMs have been moving towards advanced encryption schemes across the board. Global B (the electrical system underlying the C8) is a totally different beast than cracking a normal ECU, as it's built with the idea of OTA updates and full autonomy built into the kernel (and yep, there is one of those too. Ever try and JTAG (lol) your smartphone and get the keys from a full sector encrypted partition with a secure access chip?). 

C7 had ECU architecture that dates back to 2003, C8 is brand new moving forward. The M5s TSK6 ECU architecture is probably 100 times easier to crack and Dinan just created a new solderable signal processing module so they could control things.

Is the C8 going to be tunable? Sure! But not without custom chips or Chevy's blessing for what I expect to be a long long while.

If it *does* get cracked I would expect it to be from a leak, not from crackers who have been working with basically the same flash security schemes that people have been using on video games since 97.

Global B has over 100 compute modules in the harness, each and every one of them is end to end encrypted. The only other type of vehicle that has that kind of encryption throughout right now is in the aviation industry.

/ˈvī(ə)ləns/

noun

behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something.

I don't understand how you are even conceptually equating the creation of proprietary software with violence.

Also terorisim implies violence (actual, physical violence) to meet a *political* goal.

How on Earth am I inflicting pain on my customers? I write software that helps doctor's make better decisions with opiates. If anything one could argue that the abscense of my software would have a bigger negative impact than it's creation. The only reason it *can* exist is because we charge for it, so we have the *ability* to keep making it and the resources to invest into making it more effective.

""But capitalism is the problem then"" capitalism isn't going away. It just isn't. Even the most socially liberal systems have booming private software sectors, because they recognize its ability to fertilize innovation via the investment of resources. 

I understand that capitalism has its pitfalls (especially with regards to disabled, differently abled, societal prejudices, nepotism, the list goes on) and there are methods of alleviating them even in a majority capitalistic society (UBI being a great example). 

With that said. There's no way I would even consider quitting my job for an extra $12K a year. I like my job. I like what I do and I like the impact it has on society. It's not soul crushing even in the slightest. The good kind of greed is to push people into mutually beneficial situations, what a vast majority of sales people do is convincing of mutuality.

UBI needs something to tax to be able to function, and it comes from capital gains one way or another. Whats wrong with capitalism if we can construct it to provide a satisfying existance for those who are unable to themselves otherwise? I recognize this isn't the case at the moment, but calling the entirety of capitalism incompatible with this is overseeing it's inherit benefits, and downplaying the equally strong weaknesses of it's alternatives.

I think it's interesting that you described a cloud software and videogame company inflicting ""so much pain and suffering"". I am curious, what was the (non abstract please) mechanism behind this pain and suffering.
