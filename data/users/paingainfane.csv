Fitness,fckcjiq,t3_eh4cnh,1577722267.0,"First up, I’m 40 so I’ve been doing this a little while.  Have patience and commitment and you’ll get there.  Playing the long game with lifting is the key to solid gains and little/no injury.

I’m pretty balanced in my body, but my lifts are limited to what I have at home.  So, lots of dumbbell movements and creativity when doing things like legs (larger muscle groups).  I’ve done the bench now and then when I get to a gym, but it takes a few days to get used to it before I can really max out."

Great job though and yes commitment consistency and patience..."
Fitness,fcj92mw,t1_fcj4753,1577680319.0,"Yep, flat press.  I rotate the rep quantities a lot depending on weight, but at 100s I do 6 sets of 8.  I’ve also got 35 lbs on you.

Keep up the work.  When I started I flatlined at 70s for some reason, but after a few months it just opened right up. For me it was frequent changing of reps and weights, keeping the body guessing."
