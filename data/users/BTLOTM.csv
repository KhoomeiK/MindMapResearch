It was in fact what I was planning to do, and then he brought that up that a lot of people do that, and I told him I would be coming back cuz I was going to donate.

It feels like it would be really easy to replicate the coolest part of gold and silver, going back to Kanto, and it would let you push back your development cycle so that you have more time to work on your other games.
