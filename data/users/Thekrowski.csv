Just because you're fine with something doesn't mean tothers have to be.

Clarifying they're a woman (ie don't call me a guy) doesn't mean they're necessarily upset.

And if they were upset, that doesn't mean they were approaching anywhere near the levels of ""doNt AsSuMe mY gEnDeR"" memery.

And if they were near the levels of ""doNt AsSuMe mY gEnDeR"" memery they'd probably use stronger wordchoice than ""I'm a woman"".

So you go browse top trending posts and you see people have these fabulously detailed worlds with XYZ and TUV stuff in it that your world does not. So you tear your world and down and start reworking it far beyond what you originally wanted.
