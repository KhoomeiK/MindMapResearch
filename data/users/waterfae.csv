VetTech,feqyyln,t1_fepmg2b,1579347691.0,"Really depends on the dog. It’s typically the first course of action when dealing with separation/storm/boarding anxiety. A lot of times it does the trick and calms a dog down, sometimes they get tired and go to sleep, sometimes it doesn’t affect them at all. If the anxiety is serious and trazadone isn’t helping, then it’s time to consider something stronger like xanax."

OldSchoolCool,fei0uyx,t1_fehxbn4,1579127843.0,"Exactly this. At this time, monarchies all over Europe were being deposed and the British royal family couldn’t risk doing anything blatantly unpopular. It’s why they changed the name of their royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in 1917 because they couldn’t risk being seen as German insiders in the aftermath of the Great War and the revolutions that followed."
