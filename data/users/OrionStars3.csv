whatsthisplant,ffif93p,t1_ffhuxxe,1579972460.0,I didn’t know they were invasive! We planted these to decrease the chances of our home being burnt down during the next CA fire.

wholesomememes,ffggw6p,t1_ffggjy0,1579905960.0,"I might ask Reddit too, because the one time I used puffy stickers the kids were HYPED and asked me to tape them so they could remove them and put them on their binders and such. I was afraid to keep going because I didn’t want to make any SPED kid feel like they were being singled out. I guess that’s my own insecurities coming out"
wholesomememes,ffggcce,t1_ffgdpm4,1579905603.0,How does it make you feel? I work with special ed (mostly behaviorally challenged) and I’ve been wondering if giving them stickers that smell nice would lift their spirits?
