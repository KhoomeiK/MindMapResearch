IdiotsFightingThings,femwrdj,t1_fdngluq,1579271630.0,Pro tip: After getting into such an accident take down your dashcam and don't tell them. They could get aggresive and try to take your dashcam to protect themselves or they might try to leave the scene. Let the person tell the police their side of the story and use the dashcam footage to neglect their claims afterwards. They will instantly lose all credibility and there is police on-site.

unpopularopinion,fejjjqj,t1_fdzu04s,1579176929.0,"Taste is your personal preference but aspartame is definetly not poison.   
The EFSA ruled aspartame safe for human consumption and set an acceptable daily intake of aspartame at 40 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight. So if you were a 90 kg adult you can have 3,6 grams of aspartame. Aspartame is about 180 times sweeter than sugar and thus those 3,6 grams are as powerful as about 650 grams of sugar in terms of sweetness. A can of diet coke contains  180 mg of aspartame. So if you are 90kg you can drink 20 cans before reaching the recommended limit and there is a big margin between that limit and actual physical dangers."
greentext,fejio35,t1_feji8er,1579175937.0," For placing ‘a’ or ‘an’ before a noun, the initial alphabet is not the criterion. The initial sound matters. Consider that ‘umbrella’ starts with ‘a’ sound, so it takes ‘an’ before it. But ‘university, union, universe, unity, unicycle, uniform’ start with ‘y’ which is a consonant sound. So, we place ‘a’ before such words."
