That after 4 college deferments he got a out of nowhere diagnosis of bone spurs. Which kept him out do the draft but, in his words, still able to dodge std‚Äôs in NYC. 

Also his long time lawyer confirmed [it](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2019/02/27/trumps-lawyer-no-basis-for-presidents-medical-deferment-from-vietnam/).


This was one google search for ‚ÄúTrump Bone Spurs‚Äù. For the ideal NCO, you sure as shit don‚Äôt know how to solve problems or research yourself. Perhaps the username was ironic."

politics,ff7jbfq,t3_eryydr,1579650893.0,"I did. I voted in 2018. Also in 2019, 2017, 2016 and every other year since I was 18. I also voted in about 80% of off cycle elections and primaries. 

We only have this trial because people voted the republicans out of power in the house. Protest all you want, Trump is getting acquitted 53-47. 

You have to show up to vote in November and vote blue no matter who up and down the ticket.

Winners vote. The losers are the ones who have no option but to protest."

politics,ff6zimm,t1_ff6yqok,1579638098.0,"Well the White House did get to cross examine. The republicans on the committee got to ask plenty of leading questions and statements that were outright lies. And the recent texts from Parnas show that the WH was always in communication with Nunes and the republicans in the house. 

So your family is wrong. They were crossed examined. 


Also if you use the metaphor that this is like a criminal trial you‚Äôd see on Law and Order. The house impeachment is like the grand jury, the first part where they decide if there is enough evidence to even press charges and go to a trial. And in real like and in Law and Order, defendants don‚Äôt have the right to question anyone before a grand jury. They don‚Äôt even have to be in the room or even know they are before a grand jury. Their rights to defense start once they are charged and then tried.  Like what we are doing now in the Senate, where there is a whole table of WH lawyers and they get equal time as the House layers. 

Also in criminal law and on Law and Order, grand juries are totally secret and behind closed doors. So Trump actually got better treatment than we would have on an episode of Law and Ofer because we got to watch his grand jury arguments and he had people there (the republicans on the committee) to defend him."

Second would the chapel is still an in use chapel. Popes are elected in that room. Special services are held there. So the Vatican probably wants the room treated with holy reverence. So that mean quiet contemplation and prayer. Not talking and group selfies. 


Third. They probably sell reprints and photos of the ceiling in the chapel at the Vatican gift shop and they want you to buy their shit."
