watchpeoplesurvive,fguda7x,t1_fgtluw9,1581118010.0,"I once read a story about a boy who's mother and father were murdered when he was only 1 years old. But he was able to survive the attempted murder and the murderer was somehow killed during the attack. The baby became famous, but was quickly moved away to another town to live with his aunt and uncle, where people didn't know him, so he could grow up without living with all that fame and popularity and just be normal, not knowing that he was special."
