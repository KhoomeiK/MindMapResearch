Even if she doesnâ€™t have those resources for self she probably was ready to find them for you. When you care and have been friends with someone this long things are taken very seriously like you would family. I would feel the same way about my best friend of the last 10 years. When you care and love someone as much as it seems your best friend does when these big serious things happen to you she herself probably needs to decompress as well and get perspective and help from her own family and her boyfriend. Now I can see why that would rub you wrong about things being told of them, and I get that, but you have to understand from her perspective she might need help processing it in order to feel like she can help you.

You involved her by texting her and calling her in what was an assault situation. So I feel like itâ€™s really natural that sheâ€™d be absolutely concerned if not completely anxious about it. I absolutely would be. And looking at your posting history I can understand why she might have some anxiety about it.

You also make a quip that you had gone essentially under the radar for two days, when that wasnâ€™t the case from what I read. It was 4 to 6 days, which is worlds different when the last thing you hear from a person is them being hurt and drunk with a domestic partner. 

I understand wanting space and some privacy, and perhaps that something you need to step away with for your own sake. 

But I donâ€™t find her actions and her worry that unreasonable considering the context youâ€™ve given me."
relationship_advice,fekxeig,t3_epoihm,1579209581.0,"So Iâ€™ll be frank, if my best friend had texted me/ called me that she had been in a physical altercation with a boyfriend that wound up with police presence, and then she suddenly went completely and utterly radio silent for six days, yeah Iâ€™d be freaking the fuck out too. 

And I would be looking up as much information online as I possibly could to find out if sheâ€™s in need of help. And I might go so far as to tell my husband or some family in the event they know how to handle the situation and ensure both your safety and my calmed anxiety. 

I personally donâ€™t really view this is overstepping boundaries, at least for me it wouldnâ€™t bother me if my friends were that same level of concerned. A drunk altercation resulting in injury and the cops would scare the living shot out of me, doubly so once I couldnâ€™t reach my best friend to see if I need to get her legal counsel or bail or medical care or a cab, esp if you donâ€™t have a parent you can reach out to."
