Seattle,fecsmdg,t1_fecnade,1578983050.0,"Twilight is set in Forks on the Olympic Peninsula.  I think Twin Peaks was set in Roslyn but maybe that’s just where the diner is?  Been a long time since I’ve seen that show.

I’ve never seen twilight but it ruined my favorite places to visit so....."
MadeMeSmile,fecshml,t1_fecs7ga,1578982911.0,"That’s the approach I’m taking, I figure even if I don’t “diet” if I cut out all the shit (soda, alcohol, fast food, junk food) and can drop my first 20, then exercising will be easier and help get me that last 30."
MadeMeSmile,fecrt1i,t3_eobm9r,1578982184.0,"This is so awesome!!!  Can I ask, how did you get started?  Did you change your diet and then start exercising or did you start working out first, some specific diet you followed, etc?

I have 50 pounds I have to lose this year and it feels so incredibly overwhelming."

Ps - sorry our president sucks and is a tyrant.  We aren’t all like him."

LifeProTips,fdbp8xz,t1_fdbp5r9,1578259739.0,To return the behavior.  :)
LifeProTips,fd7sfux,t1_fd7qhl8,1578209381.0,That’s probably because you are a nice person.  I think we are seeing the same coin from different sides.  My post was also meant to remind people that we need to care for and love those in our life and make sure they know it.  I think I was just coming from a different angle.
LifeProTips,fd7s30b,t1_fd7r9jw,1578209221.0,"Wow, I’m sorry you’re so cynical and jaded.  As a person who has lost several people to suicide as well has struggled personally with depression and self harm, it seems like the world needs a reminder to be kind and let people know they matter and are loved."
LifeProTips,fd7nlj0,t1_fd7mi39,1578207235.0,"The healthiest of marriages are based on trust, communication, and integrity.  If it happens, talk about it with your spouse and come to a decision together."
LifeProTips,fd7ncv9,t1_fd7lvpd,1578207130.0,For sure.  I worded this poorly and should have said if you have someone who does it often they might be lonely.
LifeProTips,fd7jjfl,t1_fd7jhaq,1578205509.0,This is so important!
LifeProTips,fd7jc9e,t1_fd7ijjk,1578205428.0,Preach!
LifeProTips,fd7dqe6,t1_fd7d697,1578202887.0,"I’m sorry to hear that... next time, please feel free to send me a message!  Ill always listen"
LifeProTips,fd7d0jc,t1_fd7bjzb,1578202566.0,"No no no!!!  God I really wish i had worded my post better.  There are people out there that are genuinely nice, I was only saying that if you have one friend that seems to do it a lot for no reason that they might be suffering from loneliness."
LifeProTips,fd7bdh5,t1_fd79wn6,1578201917.0,I’m sorry you feel that way.  Don’t let others self involvement ruin your self esteem or self worth.  You are enough.  You are good enough.  You are smart enough.  You are pretty/handsome enough.  You are enough!
LifeProTips,fd79mwt,t1_fd79b84,1578201243.0,I’m proud of you for taking care of yourself and doing what you need to recognize where you’re at and what can help.  You’re a strong individual and I find you inspiring.
LifeProTips,fd75i92,t1_fd756cb,1578199692.0,This!  Thank you!!
LifeProTips,fd74mak,t1_fd74hci,1578199367.0,"Yikes.  Yes, there are crazies out there that think they are entitled and misread.  This is very good advice.  Trust your judgment and be firm and clear in your intentions!"
LifeProTips,fd732r3,t1_fd72t72,1578198820.0,"I definitely should have reworded my post. I didn’t mean to imply everyone doing it is lonely.  I know there are just nice people out there.  I meant more like if you have that one friend that sends a message like that to you often, they might be struggling with feelings of loneliness."
LifeProTips,fd72vmm,t1_fd72mkh,1578198750.0,"I’m so sorry.  I care.  I know I’m a stranger and don’t mean anything to you, but I care about you and I hope you’re okay.  I’m here if you if you ever need someone."
LifeProTips,fd72g43,t1_fd725rf,1578198600.0,I’m sorry you went through that :( I hope you’re in a better place now.
LifeProTips,fd71nil,t1_fd710o0,1578198341.0,I think only lonely people would maybe think you’re lonely.  There are lots of just genuinely nice people out there that reach out because they care.  But some friends that do it often to you might be lonely?
LifeProTips,fd6zs95,t1_fd6zaxs,1578197728.0,I definitely didn’t mean to imply that every thoughtful person is also lonely.  You might just be a really nice person!!
LifeProTips,fd6y9uy,t1_fd6xukj,1578197208.0,I’m so sorry that happened :( I’m sure she has her reasons but that doesn’t negate how it made you feel.
LifeProTips,fd6x1td,t1_fd6wqu0,1578196793.0,Oh yeah that’s bad!!
LifeProTips,fd6unvi,t1_fd6uizy,1578195935.0,"If it counts for anything, I’m always here if you’re lonely!"
LifeProTips,fd6uifs,t1_fd6u2b3,1578195880.0,Sounds like you and I are similar.  I have really bad anxiety so I overthink everything all the time and no matter how much I hear that sometime is okay I still stress out that it’s not.  I’m working on being better and I’ve come a long way.  Every day is a journey.
LifeProTips,fd6u6s4,t1_fd6tmx2,1578195761.0,Thank you!  And same to you!
LifeProTips,fd6tag7,t1_fd6t3kz,1578195437.0,"Well then it’s just a compliment, right?"
