AnimalsBeingDerps,ff9c0nk,t1_ff8hbgz,1579709524.0,Hahaha I always like to imagine what the person said when someone replies like this to a comment that was deleted.
trees,ff8ldyl,t1_ff82jl0,1579684177.0,"In Switzerland almost every household has a gun, no problems with guns here though."
trees,ff8l9u6,t1_ff8dgcg,1579684000.0,Uhhh what?
hmmm,ff87jpm,t1_ff7w7yn,1579668247.0,At first I wanted to point it out. But when I realized it I thought he might as well know the proper way of saying it? Just from a non-native speaker to another.
hmmm,ff6vqfr,t1_ff6sor0,1579635867.0,"Uhhhh... I'm pretty sure you snort cocain, but I guess you could somehow manage to snore it. (woops sorry, I'm guessing English isn't your first language?)"
funny,ff6vj4d,t1_ff6mmlf,1579635749.0,And you'd think that all the overwhelming amount of proof would convince them.
Drugs,ff6b1b3,t1_ff68m4f,1579623264.0,Dose varies from person to person.
funny,ff5gpad,t1_ff4zez3,1579592091.0,"Ahhh yes ""cheese""."
Drugs,ff2t7ti,t1_ff2e7js,1579523160.0,"Can confirm this, spectacular performance."

Showerthoughts,fen86ij,t1_fen6l3n,1579279087.0,"But Trump made it great again?

Edit: guess this is necessary: /s"
gaming,femn4au,t1_femcci6,1579263313.0,Well what if you're too skinny and have to have a more fatty diet? It could also mean that you eat more.
gaming,femn0gt,t1_femc8pp,1579263196.0,Yes but it's not necessarily implied.
gaming,fembvs5,t1_fembjbi,1579247751.0,Being on a diet doesn't mean eating less food.
greentext,fem7rzs,t3_epnmib,1579242828.0,"She's a bitch, why would she mention that she has a birthday coming up but not invite him?"
Ayahuasca,fekam7b,t3_eplv7t,1579196062.0,Wow this doesn't seem very likely for shamans to do that. Has anyone had an experience like this? I don't really trust what I read online anymore.
trees,fek7um8,t1_fejldm5,1579194430.0,There's something very wrong when the police have to have a daily quota. If there aren't any arrests or fines handed out during the whole day its actually a very good thing! It means that the police are actually being effective.
LSD,fek3h2s,t1_fejskwt,1579191812.0,Why don't you just review it first?
facepalm,fek2wdt,t1_fejz2mp,1579191461.0,Yeah I didn't say that it didn't make sense. I just said that there's more explaining to do to understand why Fahrenheit isn't illogical.
facepalm,fejs1xn,t1_fejp1ff,1579184440.0,It makes sense but you have to explain a whole lot more to understand it. Celsius is much easier to understand why.
funny,fejrrvs,t1_fee05c7,1579184232.0,"Ahhh land of the free. Where they put stuff like ""non-gmo"" on their food products. Or one of my favourites is ""gluten-free"" on carrots or whatever which obviously is just to sell to people who don't have a problem with gluten but like to be trendy."
funny,fejrkcj,t1_fee367a,1579184078.0,Just cause it's like that in the US doesn't automatically mean it's like that in the whole world wtf.
Jokes,fejjso7,t1_fejhbsx,1579177197.0,It comes from like French or something i think.
madlads,feh7fiq,t1_fegsh3g,1579110714.0,"It's worse than water cause they have to first have a cow that makes it and food/shelter for the cow, then they need to milk the cow, skim the milk which requires more energy and then they have to package it in a non-recyclable container and the end result is pretty much just water."
madlads,feh731h,t1_fegv15q,1579110512.0,Skimmed milk is just water lying about being milk.

funny,fedz4l2,t1_fedwr4j,1579022944.0,Uhhh is that how you recycle things?
Psychonaut,fedx0oh,t1_fedawfw,1579021681.0,"Ever considered being agnostic? Because the concept of god is very abstract, you could say nature is god, or the Sun is god because it gives us energy or you are god because you are matter experiencing itself. I mean no one in this world believes in the \*exact\* same thing, even people who believe religion will differ in opinion on some things. What makes you so sure there \*isn't\* a god? That's why I'm agnostic, I guess. It's a bit more balanced."

Ayahuasca,feae62p,t3_eo8j7v,1578947516.0,"I see you are very respectful of the medicine. That's a very good thing but it's also important to trust the medicine, it's super intelligent and it'll know just how to heal you. Also if things get too intense you can always let the shaman guide you."
AskReddit,fe7thu0,t1_fe6rhgz,1578919101.0,"Stop drinking it for a while, you'll find out that you feel much better without it. I don't even remember when the last time was that i had a cola. Those things are stupidly sweet, anyone who doesn't drink soda is probably on the same page here. Normal cola has an exaggerated amount of sugar and diet cola is even worse because it has sweeteners and will damage your liver."
gaming,fe535fe,t3_enpba6,1578865230.0,Golden Sun had a couple of usable doors facing north.
interestingasfuck,fduxqcd,t3_en3xjo,1578740678.0,Humans can be so weird and disturbing. Making rules that are so obviously wrong but still not much changes and things stay fucked up.
shrooms,fdrct75,t1_fdqk0ag,1578682609.0,Wait what???
replications,fdqs569,t1_fdptpyz,1578673711.0,Ikr? I think they're probably harder to replicate but also they end up being so much more accurate.
outdoorgrowing,fdqq5m3,t1_fdpofuz,1578672490.0,"It's a completely natural process. The plant isn't going to look pristine all the time, specially outside. The lower leaves are yellow cause they don't get as much sun as the top leaves, so the plant prioritizes the ones that get the most sun and sacrifices the lower ones."
microgrowery,fdq7ql4,t1_fdpmmmn,1578658401.0,"Hi, I'm a tico currently living in Switzerland but I've been interested in having a grow-op in cr for a while now. Would you have any tips to start? Or perhaps I could go help you next time I go there."
microgrowery,fdkmhob,t1_fdkbsuh,1578506624.0,You mean 90% of the cup? Cause this plant is definitely not 90% roots.
Psychonaut,fdkalw1,t1_fdk3ihz,1578499815.0,"It's a game of hide and seek pretty much, but within. Finding yourself is like remembering. At least thats what I understood."
AskReddit,fdhtgyc,t1_fdgnf3r,1578429863.0,"I love when you suddenly start to ""get"" physics in an everyday basis. It really can get in handy."
trees,fdhm6xr,t1_fdgnoq4,1578425602.0,So how does that happen exactly? You roll the joint and then just forget it exists?
trees,fdhm2rf,t1_fdgo3wp,1578425532.0,It's obviously a dragonfly.
spirituality,fdgv0yc,t1_fdgkgxd,1578409019.0,"Well I understood what OP meant, and it's an entertaining thought. I don't have to accept it, but I can understand it."
news,fdgkunc,t1_fdgja1w,1578400712.0,"How would you define a mental health disorder? I believe that if you think it's ok to fuck some serious shit up, than you definitely have a mental problem."
spirituality,fdgka7l,t1_fdgft2c,1578400136.0,"Well there is no past self either, time is just something we created to have like a point of reference. I mean how would you say what OP said? My now self of the future? My now self to be? My not yet now self?"
Unexpected,fdgjdq4,t1_fdg3fmv,1578399195.0,What logic?
Unexpected,fdg21c0,t1_fdg0u8h,1578377119.0,I have a friend who has been giving his dog bones through its entire life and hasn't had a single problem ðŸ¤”

outdoorgrowing,fcwxv78,t3_eja2w1,1578042296.0,It's not looking too bad. Just transplant to a bigger pot (I recommend not a clear one or black since it dries out the water faster) with some good soil and it should be fine. I'd only add nutes if the yellowing worsens.
LSD,fcwxq08,t1_fcvl850,1578042108.0,Except for the fact that he's holding Yoko Ono's hand.
mildlyinteresting,fctq31j,t1_fctcz3q,1577953703.0,I've been wondering why people complain about GMOs cause almost any fruit or vegetable we can buy has been manipulated some way or another.

Damnthatsinteresting,fbzzlet,t1_fbz3eeb,1577270484.0,"This was probably made by someone who did this their entire life. Also got all the information from their ancestors who did this as well. It's the same reason why we can't recreate the buildings that we used to build, like cathedrals for example."
