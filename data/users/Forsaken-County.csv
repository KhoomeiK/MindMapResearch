sonos,ffdtzvf,t1_ffdpvfn,1579828885.0,But they won’t work together with the playbar
sonos,ffdmd7n,t1_ffdcx02,1579823953.0,"Yeah so my wife just brought this up: 

Say you have a playbar which was bought as a home cinema with two play1’s in surround. (Sonos sells this package) ... your play1’s get EOLd but your playbar doesnt. Then suddenly you can’t have surround anymore.

First world problems sure but $"

I’m going to sell them tomorrow. I’m up a couple hundred so that should help buy into a different product range!"

I like the product and I have a terrible feeling that in a year or so I’ll crack, take the 30% and upgrade.

Now I’m going to investigate other brands.

Sucks huge donkey bits. I love the brand and I’ve been invested for years. I have something like 9 units, 3 of which are affected by this and I assume the playbar and play1’s are next."

UKPersonalFinance,ff3k1iz,t1_ff3dul7,1579542703.0,"I’m an expat in the US currently. Typical fuel is $2.30 in rural areas, up to 3.80 in city centre.  I think it’s roughly $6 in the UK.

As a result I drive everywhere. Serious convenience and it’s super cheap. Recently did a huge week away involving a 1000 mile each way car trip and it cost 1/5th of the flight.

Honestly very little reason to have fuel duty costing so much in the UK other than revenue.

You can’t blame climate as public transport is shit in the UK and you can’t have a modern economy if people can’t move goods, services and people easily."

Got very tired towards end!

Our flights got cancelled and we jumped in the car and drove 1000 miles on a whim to not miss out on vacation.

Atlas performed wonderfully. Flawless on the highways, comfortable and easy to drive. In the mountains with ice and snow it also did very well. Not on winter tires so being extra careful was a good thing.

This is my 3rd VW and I’ve never enjoyed a car before other than an A to B. The atlas is an amazing machine."

Biggest difference is the bowls, tree runs etc . You just don’t get that type of skiing. But man those bowls. They’re mindblowing. 

There’s also a big difference  in snow quality. In Europe I’ve had only a handful of real powder days despite so much experience. In the US you get them so often! I’ve had a powder day this year already..."
skiing,fdln8bp,t1_fdl835z,1578527860.0,"Just wanted to say as someone who spent his whole adult life (35) skiing in Europe....vail and all American resorts are just so much better for the skiing. Not the après, accommodation etc.

Raw skiing for those of us who don’t live locally to a mountain and get 2-4 weeks a season, America is amazing. Vail is mind blowing with the back bowls. Those just don’t exist. So far I’ve been to 4-5 resorts and plan on hitting up more. Epic pass is indeed epic."

chicago,fd93sun,t1_fd6k4ve,1578227978.0,"Sure.

The premise is you go into what looks like a bar. Usually deep electro or reggae remixes very very loud. Full of young folks from all over Europe. All are very stoned/drunk/both -Order from a menu, and you can then smoke in premise or take away. Volcano vapes are popular on the counters. Some also serve alcohol and overpriced food. 

Also, European smoking culture is all about the spliffs. Ever since the tobacco bans all over - you now have to smoke pure, vape or use tobacco alternatives (sometimes provided). I think this shifted smoking culture a lot bizarrely. Harder to smoke hash and more heavy skunk is consumed in larger quantities.

The cafes themselves vary. Some are themed, some are tucked down alleys and only open during the day (the best and most chill ones). Some of the big ones like the bulldog cover multiple floors. City centre ones can be seedy, it also has a constant low level ‘on edge’ atmosphere because of pickpockets and other petty crime as well as a healthy dose of weirdos.

Amsterdam is a beautiful and historical city that attracts tourists anyway. The centre also attracts stoners, stag do’s (cheap booze and legal sex scene too).  It’s also a big business centre. I’ve been on business as many times in my life on business than for fun.

You also come across stoners who drifted to Amsterdam in their late teens and never left. Slightly depressing. Finally harder drugs are not openly sold but Amsterdam has a very soft eye on drugs generally. I am not a fan but to each their own. It does mean a lot of people tripping on just about everything under the sun. Again, that means more crazies to keep an eye out for. 

I enjoyed the legality of it, but the culture has shifted over the last 15 years and I don’t see it as fun as I used too."
chicago,fd5yj36,t1_fd5fmyj,1578183115.0,"I’ve been to Amsterdam 10-15 times in my life. The cafes are awesome but the culture around them is not chill in the slightest.
