I remember having them with me at the hotel, but some time after we got back to his house, I wanted to wear them again but I couldn't find them. I was upset because I thought I left them at the hotel. Boyfriend assures me they must be in the house somewhere, because we made absolutely sure we left nothing behind before we checked out of the hotel(we do a double sweep, because we tend to forget things otherwise). When I went home, he said he'd make sure to find them in the house. I was back home for a week or so and I was straitening my bedroom and I found my bag of bracelets in a box. I was so confused, because I know I took them with me to his house, then definitely remember wearing them at the hotel.

AskReddit,fdccy3t,t1_fdago13,1578271878.0,"You could try audiobooks, too. If you have time but struggle to read(no judgement, all kinds of reasons) while wanting to enjoy a story, audiobooks might help. Also, what another person said, make sure you are trying books that are interesting to you. I read almost exclusively fantasy, science fiction, and horror(I can't stand things like romance novels or plain action novels, historical things like the Scarlet Letter etc.). I don't read every single one I find. Some authors write ones I find boring. Some are hella interesting. You just have to try them to see which genres you like, and in that, which authors you like. Since you mentioned being a social media addict, I recommend trying collections of short stories. They might be better for you at first to train your attention span back to longer things. Also, definitely pay attention to recommendations based on books/authors you've read. It definitely helps me find similar authors with stories that have the same feel to ones I already like."
