TrueChristian,fft7otw,t3_ev12nc,1580211203.0,"Hey man, I honestly think you did the right thing!  I'm sure it took some daring to do that.  I think someone who has always avoided conflict in life is going to need to practice it a lot before they get good at it.  So in the beginning it might not have the desired outcome, but just try to be open to changing *how* you confront people.  You want to try to be direct and honest but give them ""room"" to defend themselves.  For instance, you should never confront someone by saying, ""You're a selfish person and you need to stop being so selfish"".  Instead, say something like, ""I feel like you eat a lot of my food and never reimburse me and that's making me irritated.""  or ""you spend a lot of time on your phone"".  These sort of things open up a conversation and allow the other person to express how they feel.  They might have a surprisingly good motive or at least a reason you can empathize with.  

That being said, you did mention that you were gentle and loving, so it might not be you at all.  It could just be that he is offended and is coping by avoidance.  In that case, you probably need to go to his house or something to really force the conversation to happen.  He will probably get angry but in the end he will know it's because you are trying to love him well and are willing to fight for the relationship."
TrueChristian,fft6roy,t3_ev2h3l,1580210002.0,"Actually, there isn't much in the Bible about hell and there is only one verse about ""the rapture"" which never even mentions that word.  The leading theologians of Jesus' day were divided over whether there was even any such thing as an afterlife - that's how vague the Bible is about it.  It's equally vague about Heaven.  So if the Bible isn't about heaven and hell, what is it about?  My recommendation is to sit down and read the book of Matthew (in one sitting) and then write a paragraph about what the book is about.  (I did this in college and it changed my life) 

As far as evangelism, what was Jesus' method?  And Paul's and the other apostles in the new testament?"

TrueChristian,fft19xv,t3_eullhp,1580201696.0,"I feel you bro.  But it's really not hopeless, Jesus is actually in control right now on the right hand of the throne of God, and He is raising up the Church into full maturity until his justice and love fills every corner of the globe.  Don't give up, you are part of the solution."

PrayerTeam_amen,ffst1xp,t1_ff9spcl,1580191413.0,"true that.  still getting blessed in Heaven I guess.  though I can't agree about the ""end times"" since they already happened back in the first century AD.  The ""new world"" (aka Kingdom of God) is already here in our midst, we just need to be obedient to God so that He can bring it fully (on earth as it is in Heaven).  So please don't sit in front of the TV waiting for the rapture to happen, get out there and try to bring Heaven to the world."

Mountaineering,fe3a0fg,t3_enpgte,1578847355.0,"I wish I'd done something at 22.  I never even hiked a trail until I was 23 and I didn't rock climb until 27.  I did some mountaineering here and there in my late 20s, but I didn't do an actual mountaineering school until I was 30.  Actually, in my experience mountaineering is more a sport for older guys 50+ because it is very expensive and time consuming.  At least if you want to do anything in the Himalayas, Pamirs, etc...  BTW, have you read the greatest mountaineering book of all?  *Conquistadors of the Useless*?"
