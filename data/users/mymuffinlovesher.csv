Epilepsy,ffbts6g,t3_esrjwn,1579782465.0,"Hi there! I've been on Vimpat for almost 2 years now (26F) and adjusting to it was interesting to say the least. I just saw a new neurologist finally last week and I'm on day 6 of starting Lamictal (in addition to the Vimpat because I'm still having seizures sometimes).

I would say it's just a process that we have to go through. I know that's what the doctors say, but it is true to a great degree. Everyone processes drugs differently and we just have to wait and do as we're instructed to do by the doctors. So I just take it in stride and say fuck you to the side effects and all the things I can't do anymore. Yes, being tired all the time really sucks, but you know what? I'm no longer so freaking hard on myself. We have an illness that we have to deal with. So be kind to yourself and take care of yourself. 

Accepting that you are different and no longer ""normal"" (maybe people who have been seizure free for awhile feel differently?) is pretty tough, but once you accept it, life gets easier and better.

Depression is hard and it got really, really bad for me. I finally sought therapy when I started to get suicidal thoughts and was laying in bed majority of the time. Therapy changed my life!"

Epilepsy,ff5xzer,t3_erms9e,1579613914.0,"This is a wonderful story! Thank you for posting! That must be so hard for her parents to have lost their daughter, but it's amazing how much money they've raised."
worldpolitics,fei7ceo,t3_ep605t,1579131906.0,"I agree with this, but why is it in worldpolitics?"
Showerthoughts,fed8v55,t3_eofryd,1579004008.0,Correction: I am female and do not have balls.
worldpolitics,fed8ks5,t1_fea80fm,1579003730.0,"Me too. It's the reason people just don't seek care, because it's just too expensive. People can't afford it. I's shameful for our country to be like that!"
worldpolitics,fed8hst,t1_fea81i0,1579003641.0,"Edit: I meant employers, not employees! Stupid autocorrect."
worldpolitics,fea7eyw,t1_fe8go1h,1578945235.0,Same! Mine is about that much too. The price of private health insurance is ridiculous. And you still pay when you get treatment anywhere. I have to pay $50 just to see the damn doctor. Lol.
worldpolitics,fea70nh,t1_fe8fbxq,1578945090.0,"I agree with you, definitely. I was just explaining the mindset of for-profit pharmaceutical industries. And exactly what you said, many people would work on cures if their employees allowed them to, but their employees don't allow them to because money."
worldpolitics,fe7q8fd,t1_fdxt6he,1578917880.0,"Oh absolutely. I tried to explain all of that to her, but she just kept trying to prove how her mindset was right and my compassion was too wrong...too much that it would get this country in trouble if we were all compassionate like that. She also said all of my points were wrong. That there's always a way to get yourself out of a bad situation, you just have to have the will power.

Edit: so that's who we're dealing with; selfish, brainwashed people that only look out for themselves. Thankfully she didn't claim to be a Christian. That is the ultimate oxymoron, isn't it?"
worldpolitics,fe7pi93,t1_fe2dzrc,1578917736.0,"Right, exactly. People are motivated to make medications and find cures for things because of the money involved, not because they're all nice people wanting to help sick people. Some, maybe, but most are probably in it for the money. There would be no motivation to make generics (or medications at all for that matter) if there was no money in it. That's the unfortunate truth. Same with US doctors, for instance."
worldpolitics,fe7p1gy,t1_fdxv6qa,1578917555.0,"I like the idea. There's not one type of epilepsy though. There's different medicine for different types, so would they make all of them a priority or just one? I guess what I'm getting at is maybe it's a bit more complicated than we think and that's why it'll take longer than we want it to. People have to agree, money has to be made. :( I love, love, love Bernie, but my concern is where he'll get the money from to do what he's saying. Is the middle class going to suffer like we always do with these things?"
Wellthatsucks,fdxt46o,t3_en87at,1578772620.0,"How did they hit a camel?? Camels don't exactly sprint out into the road like squirrels, do they??"
worldpolitics,fdxsk16,t1_fdxk7rm,1578772489.0,"Yep. I just had a conversation with a co-worker (US here) who basically said she didn't care if poor people suffer. She has her money and doesn't want to give it to anyone else who ""begs"" for it or ""takes advantage"" of the system.

Edit: she was referring to anyone else who doesn't have her 6 figure salary, not just very poor people."
worldpolitics,fdxs52n,t1_fdwgqbz,1578772372.0,There's no generic for my epilepsy medication yet. How would that work?
AskReddit,fdjrtge,t3_ell2h8,1578485136.0,"I did low contact with my mother for awhile, but I realized that that's not really the answer. I think it's best if I have more controlled contact with her and continue to set boundaries and just remind her that I am my own person. So whenever she starts treating me like a child, I'll say something along the lines of ""no mom, I'm doing it this way. Thank you though."" and I find that I do often have to repeat myself (calmly), but at least I can still have a relationship with her and not be pressured into her ""you should do it this way"" opinions. She's terrible with money and just loves to tell me what to do financially."
Epilepsy,fdf8l7h,t1_fdexpk8,1578355826.0,Love your username lol

Showerthoughts,fcu03wq,t3_eivtjr,1577967824.0,"There are already people doing that! :) It's called sociolinguistics and people dig into forums, memes, text messaging trends, etc. to understand how people are using language."

AskReddit,fcllszy,t1_fck9ygw,1577750787.0,"SAME with the Keto diet. It's meant only for children with very, very, very difficult-to-treat epilepsy."

AskReddit,fcitnqq,t1_fcikvwn,1577669543.0,This made me laugh. Thank you.
AskReddit,fcitjh6,t1_fchq6su,1577669461.0,"I actually encountered someone at my last job who prayed for my ""total healing"" after I got diagnosed with epilepsy. When I told him there was nothing anyone could do about it (because it's something I'll always have and regulate with medication), he said ""oh, but God can heal you"" and proceeded to tell me a story of him witnessing someone getting their illness prayed away. It was odd."
Epilepsy,fcisxtq,t1_fchcbu6,1577669051.0,"That's a great idea! If that ever happens to me, I'll have to ask them if that's okay."
