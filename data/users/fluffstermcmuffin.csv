We get a lot of Pro-ED posts here. They always get removed. I personally remove many. This post does not have the warning signs we typically see in a post of that nature. What it does show is someone who maybe needs a bit more information to work with. There is no benefit to anyone if no information is shared. Polite feedback is what OP posted for, and so far it is what she recieved. 

And of course we can only work with the information we have. It is a judgement call, and one that no one here would claim we are always perfect with. We can only do our best. We will continue to evaluate the situation."

As a sub we would never advocate for over restriction or unhealthy goals. However, OP is not showing any signs of aiming for unhealthy goals. It seems perhaps she is misinformed and needs guidance. Or maybe there are circumstances we are not aware of.

Lots, and lots of denial, and very likely a yet to be diagnosed case of Binge Eating Disorder. 

Your husband won't lose weight until he can get past whatever demons in his head are getting in his way. This isn't something you can fix. It is very likely beyond just food, metabolism, or calories. This sounds like it has a deep mental health link that needs to be addressed."

fatlogic,fe0czie,t1_fe0cied,1578810290.0,"I do know all of that. My point was only that people have this idea that DD regardless of band size is excessively enormous, when at a smaller band size it is in fact totally average. This is something I would not have known 100lbs ago, and I would imagine most people who have been overweight their whole adult lives probably don't know either. It was one of many things I learned while losing the weight. 

Or maybe I'm just slow and all people understand this regardless."

The thing is that you say ""my cup size is DD"" and people think that is huge, but no one looking at me would ever equate my chest size to a DD.  However when I was 210lbs my boobs were undeniably HUGE. 

So, even I would agree, anyone losing significant weight would see a difference in their chest size. Even if the cup size were to remain the same your body shape is so different you could be appropriately proportional with the smaller band size."

I do understand that you recognize you have lost a bit too much, but a 110lb loss in 8 months to land so severely underweight are some very significant red flags of disordered behavior. We won't validate such severe restriction or becoming underweight with a positive message.

We will not allow the suggestion of VLCD, or anything close enough to a VLCD. Such a severe restriction can have consequences over time when done without supervision. Beyond that they do not teach proper nutrition or instill healthy, sustainable habits when done without a support team to help fill in the gaps. VLCD are used only when the risk of continued obesity is more dangerous than the potential side effects of such a low calorie intake."

Despite what many people here have said calorie counting is *not* required to lose weight. It is very helpful, and certainly something I have used to lose weight, but there are many, many people who don't and are very successful. 

That said, calorie counting is not a negative behavior for most people. So long as you are not obsessing, or have a tendency to obsess over the numbers and do not have any history of disordered restrictive eating you should be okay. It is common for people who have dealt with those types of issues themselves to believe calorie counting is a bad practice for everyone. It is a highly personal thing."

I almost never ovulated, or had any kind of period at all for about 15 years. Then I dropped some weight, and boy was I surprised the first time I had a one!

You do have to be significantly overweight for that to occur though. I had my gallbladder removed with a BMI of like 39 and no one said a word about my weight being an issue. I know someone who was quite a bit heavier than I was and they were told old school was the only option due to their size."

You think you are gonna die a painful slow death because the inside of you is on fire. I assure you requiring a gallbladder removal is not at all equivalent to plastic surgery in terms of necessity. 

That said, if you can't have your gallbladder removed laparoscopically because of your weight you are in for a bad time. They will require you to lose weight, or if you can't (or won't) you are looking at a very major, invasive surgery instead. The risks are just too high when you are over a certain weight.

I used weight loss to prove to myself that I could control something about life. I was worried as I transitioned to maintaining vs losing that I'd have to let go of something I wasn't sure I was ready to let go of. Which sounds silly, perhaps, but having this goal to focus on for so long had become such a big part of my everyday life. If I didn't have it...then what would take all that space in my brain? 

I still have weight, health and fitness goals. I've figured out that maintenance might be and a different stage of things but it is not that different when it comes to the mental benefits. Plus proving to myself that even as I get a little older I am still capable of increasing my fitness levels is a big driving factor.

The hardest part are those times at the beginning where it is *so easy* to fall back onto comfortable habits. It's not that day 100 is easy either, but in the face of stress, exhaustion or unexpected events you would have newly built habits to navigate through the challenge. 

I always remind myself that if I persist through the early days it gets easier. If I cave that's okay too because the next choice brings another chance to keep working on those new habits. Weight loss does not require perfection, just determination to always keep going."
