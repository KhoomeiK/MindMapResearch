Anxiety,ffdd97n,t1_ffdbm6g,1579818440.0,"I agree. Mental illnesses are severely misunderstood. I think if i am open about my illness, i would be immediately replaced. So trying to hide it as much as I can. But it's so tough. I am sorry for what happened to you. That company sucks big times. Hope they go bankrupt"
Anxiety,ffdcx23,t1_ffd2e8s,1579818228.0,"This is so horrible. I am so sorry for this. I thought the HR would be understanding and I had almost considered talking to the HR about my mental illnesses till I get started on my therapy and feel better . As someone else mentioned, companies are pretentious and they don't care at all. This is so bad"
Anxiety,ffcbvav,t1_ffc4wv6,1579796092.0,"CBD didn't work for me unfortunately.  Maybe I tried the wrong dose. Cannabis makes me more anxious than ever, so don't think I can function or attend meetings while on it. Beta blockers seem to be the option for now"
Anxiety,ffc8kxl,t1_ffc76yu,1579794012.0,"Your reply put a smile on my face. But I really hope, it doesn't come to this"
Anxiety,ffc4wv6,t1_ffc3i7h,1579791605.0,I am sorry. It's shitty of them to let you go for that reason. Did your panic attacks make it impossible to work? I am afraid they might have started to look for someone else too. My manager has been a lot cold with me lately. The only silver lining to my situation is that there are 2 stakeholders who immensely like my work. So I guess I will be demoted for sure ( if not fired ).What kind of CBD do you use? I had a pen with 4:1 CBD +THC. But that didn't do anything with the physical symptoms.
Anxiety,ffc2sgb,t1_ffc2nqs,1579790115.0,My therapy got delayed and starts next month. I guess I will be suffering till then
Anxiety,ffc18ou,t1_ffc13qr,1579788962.0,Thanks. Downloading it.
Anxiety,ffc0o3u,t1_ffbzxjh,1579788524.0,"Owing to a lot of reasons, my therapy won't start until next month. So my response to these attacks was to avoid the situation altogether. But since it's getting noticed, I am more stressed out and panicking even more. I have heard really great things about Beta blockers and I can't wait to get prescribed to them."
Anxiety,fedzmtu,t1_fedvbc8,1579023246.0,So true! I am hiding it a lot. I took a promotion recently and have been in a client facing environment. So bad for my anxiety.  Embarrassed myself so much. I am afraid I will be replaced soon
Anxiety,fed5ero,t1_feci940,1578999742.0,Me too. I keep messing up during meetings constantly.  I want to tell my manager about crippling anxiety.but scared for his reactions
Anxiety,feabak1,t3_eo8ep9,1578946565.0,You killed it!Such an inspiration to the rest of us.. Congrats.  Hope you rock
Anxiety,fdqp0pa,t1_fdqmnwb,1578671776.0,"Does it alleviate symptoms of anxiety? Like heartbeat, shaky hands and voice etc.  I have terrible speech anxiety"
depression,fdqoeho,t3_emfeyp,1578671390.0,I wrote the exact something in my journal today!! Erase all memories from those who loved you and just end that misery for good
alcoholism,fdhcwq0,t3_elautc,1578420126.0,"I was about to post the same thing. I quit alcohol a few weeks back. But i keep craving it and have no alternate activities to fill in that void. I mostly hit local cafes or go shopping to beat that craving, but they don't work on Saturdays. Everything else seems so boring infront of partying:("
Anxiety,fddqare,t1_fddo790,1578321110.0,I am in applied statistics making my way into analytics and machine learning.  I mess up meetings often owing to my panic attacks and i hate it. It's horrible. Has medications helped you?
Anxiety,fdcv5fn,t3_ekmyq3,1578285206.0,"This is me too. I suffer from crippling social anxiety. Even when I am on a vacation, I constantly worry about it ending and me returning back to work. I too have to be in a client facing environment and it's killing me literally. My panic attacks are gradually getting severe. A friend of mine suffers from the same and he self medicates with alcohol.  But i am not comfortable doing that at all. I have been preparing my work material a lot so that helps a bit with my anxiety. But no other successful remedies unfortunately"
depression,fcqrrod,t1_fcqkl52,1577891192.0,Thanks for the post. I guess keeping it a secret works better for now
depression,fcqrp7r,t1_fcqgzcf,1577891162.0,I was afraid of that too. That sucks man. Sorry to hear that
alcoholism,fcqiqi9,t3_eihdcd,1577886717.0,"That sums up my past 10 years pretty accurately. Heavy drinking, toxic relationships and almost getting fired from my dream job. Whenever i thought of leaving alcohol,  I stayed good for a few months before drinking 24/7 again. Last month, I just got scared as  I had the worst hangover of my life(headache, stomach pain, high heart rate, nose bleed). I actually thought I was going to die. That's when I decided to quit. What helped me was a note i wrote to myself about how i was feeling during that hangover and the overwhelming guilt of drinking that insane amount of liquor. Whenever I get a craving, i read myself that note. It helps a lot"
depression,fcjlgm9,t3_ehfasw,1577692510.0,"Me too. You just wrote my mind. Seeing all these jolly , productive people around me exacerbates my depression. I dream that someday I will be normal and finally happy. Hasn't happened in years. But trying not to lose hope."
depression,fc83jks,t1_fc831nv,1577526019.0,Your story is same as mine. I self medicate with alcohol and i dream big. Dream where i am carefree and finally happy
depression,fc4x0lt,t3_eg1ib1,1577432000.0,Same. I am home for the holidays after one year. I feel nothing. I feign excitement and happiness when i see my family and friends. Because they are so happy to see me. My family and friends don't know about my depression.  It's so tough to do it everytime and i am so tired of faking it.
depression,fc4qc8i,t3_eg4qv1,1577424602.0,I have always envied people who found the love of their lives and are happy. I want to be them. I envy the fact that i can't be that happy and they just seem to get things easy. I keep telling myself that my depression will go away if i have someone whom i truly love and they love me. I still haven't found them owing to my crippling anxiety and honestly have given up hope of finding someone too. Most of the people i have had a crush on didn't even knew i exist.
alcoholism,fbwe43l,t3_eequ48,1577147511.0,Hey I used to party almost every weekend for the past 2 years. I quit drinking a few weeks back. But i always get peer pressured whenever i am out(because that's what they know me for). I tried avoiding situations all together but that doesn't help during holidays. Also i am not comfortable telling them about my alcoholism. The excuse i use it that i am receiving eczema treatment and cannot drink alcohol as it will aggravate my symptoms. Hope that helps
