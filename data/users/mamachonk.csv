For whatever it's worth, all I really wanted was a dress and a cake, and ours was under $8k including a lot of leftover liquor and flying 3 people in internationally. (Also, low COL area in the US and if we'd chosen Large Southeastern City instead, costs would likely have still been no more than $10 k or so for ~40 guests. But friends who got married 6 weeks before us spent > $25k in said Large Southeastern City, with ~200 guests so YMMV and costs may scale.)"

That said, we did have a registry, and we had a nice, small wedding with people we were thrilled to have just be there; most bought us some gift (just used that Crock Pot twice in the past week--13 years and still going strong! Thanks, D!), and a few just sent us gifts--we'd have rather had them there but it was a very thoughtful gesture.

I realize you feel bad for the kid, and to some extent cousin maybe, but as long as you all keep giving him the attention he's looking for, you're encouraging his behavior. If he really collapsed, \*let them\* call an ambulance. If he calls family for help because he's deathly ill, tell him to call 911 or a doctor.

But it often just takes time. I have some really cute pics of my cat meeting his new sister when he was... \~2? after his first 'sister' died (very young). He was a bit of a meanie for a few weeks. They got along after that for 18 years.

When we last introduced a new cat here, about 1.5 years ago, we had a former stray mama kitty and her 3 1.5 year old babies (so they were very used to each other). They're all inside/outside (yeah, I know). Mama kitty did NOT like the newcomer at all, hissed at him, etc. She then ran off for FIVE DAYS. I was convinced she wasn't coming back. She did,and everything is more or less kosher now. he's still a little bit of an outsider but 98% of the time they all get along, and actually, he and Mama kitty probably play the most.

Frankly, we didn't do anything special. We just waited it out and tried to give all the kitties extra attention. If you feed them together, you may want to separate them a bit and give them extra loves/treats so they associate each other with good things.

Have an abortion if it's what you want to do, and don't let anyone make you feel bad about it (easier said than done, I know).  This may not be a popular suggestion, but you can have an abortion and then tell people you miscarried.

raisedbynarcissists,fc7v9mx,t3_egjkpu,1577519541.0,"My mom doesn't like my tats. The last comment I remember her making was ""goddammit <my name>."" (I think it was my 3rd?).

That said, she worked in the financial industry (pretty conservative in general) and I would go by to see her sometimes (for lunch, to conduct business with that institution, etc.).

She waited with me in line for a few minutes to chat one day when I was 19/20? to make a transaction and some random gal who worked there (some of mom's coworkers knew me but she did not) who was probably not more than 25 walks up to ""say hi"" and immediately comments about my only slightly visible tattoo (on my chest) and asks my mom how she could ""let me"" do that. Mom ripped into her about how I was an ADULT and she couldn't tell me what to do with my OWN body and, btw, it was none of that co-worker's business. The look of shock was EPIC.

This is one of my favorite memories of my mom. She's not the parent I follow this sub because of, either, obvs. :P

Sorry for the hijacking! Glad you see the humor in your dad being ridiculous! And you sound great, btw."

Also, as an aside, many friends semi-frequently tell me my gray is ""cool"" (it's a bit... streaky. And more white. Think Bride of Frankenstein.) I've been using that as an excuse to not dye for a while. Who am I to question their good taste and fashion sense??

FWIW, we have a girl who needed 3 transfusions \~2 years ago due to unexplained red cell aplasia. It was up and down for more than a year but she is finally stable (tho she really, really HATES her daily meds).

If your cat isn't taking any preventative hairball treatment, I would recommend doing so. My current cats don't have such an issue, but I used to have one with intermittent issues (probably bc her brother was long-ish haired), and I occasionally gave her this stuff that came in a tube. She loved it, so it was like a treat. IIRC correctly it was ""malt flavored.""

Good luck!"

I'd call a couple other vets in the area, tell them what you had done (you should have or be able to get an itemized list of what they did and the charges) and ask about what they'd charge for the same stuff.

We also have one who needs to be a little sedated (we give her Gabapentin, don't know if y'all have tried that but it seems to work alright)."

I married a guy who does a good bit of the housework but still slacks in some areas from time to time. We have talks about it. Because OF COURSE he shares the housework!

Your DH should reply something snappy, like ""well, not as lucky as I am to have her!"" or ""why wouldn't I do the dishes when she spent so much more time cooking?""
