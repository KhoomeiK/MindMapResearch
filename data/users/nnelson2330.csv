Kevin Feige was on as a producer and was there to ensure nothing Sony did messed with future MCU plans, but Sony has final creative control over everything in the Spider-Man films. 

Both sides worked together because both sides had a clause in the agreement that they could pull out without penalty, but to downplay the fact that the stand alone Spider-Man films are Sony films is disingenuous at best.

Kevin Feige obviously had suggestions and I'm sure Amy Pascal looked at the $22.5 billion he's made for Disney and didn't argue with him on too much of it, but people act like it's impossible for Sony to make good movies.
