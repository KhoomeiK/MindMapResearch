The worst I really hear about Bernie is that he‚Äôs somewhat hypocritical (in regards to his focus on the working- and middle-class) for owning 3 (?) large homes.  And I think he‚Äôs flying around in a jet once in a while these days (but that‚Äôs arguably unavoidable as a presidential candidate, and I don‚Äôt think he owns the jet).

But that‚Äôs basically it.

Has anyone heard anything worse?  I think he‚Äôs the best US presidential candidate, but I‚Äôd still want to know about any shady shit in which he is, or has been, involved."
