gradadmissions,fdehcm7,t3_ekxb18,1578339042.0,"Most US colleges have a cutoff of GPA 3.0 .
Yours is unfortunately too low and there are countless applicants from India so your chances to get admit are super slim imho.

What I would suggest you is to look for RA positions in Indian universities such as top 5 IITs or IISC. That would help you in building a profile which could compensate for your low gpa, also RAship will help with having a few publications. Lastly one semester is too less of a time to make any significant difference.

Wish you good luck.

BTW Purdue is one of the best colleges out there, and is sought after by many Indian students.

No that is not what I meant. In your SOP you have to explain why you want to pursue the program?

You should explain what led you to consider MS now, why now? how will your experience help you become a good fit for their program. Hope I clarified it better.
