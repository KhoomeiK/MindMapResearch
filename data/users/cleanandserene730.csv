toastme,ff90j2h,t3_es6gq4,1579701742.0,"I know losing a baby is devastating. I'm so Sorry. I don't know why things happen, i just knowthere's a reason. although your heart will always feel love for your baby and you'll miss it, in time it will get better. It might help a little to think about how difficult it would be getting by, trying to raise a child on your own. now you can have more time to become prepared, financially, and to find a partner who is right for you and will be good for your family. That's a blessing in disguise. And your baby is in a better place....this world has gone to shit."
