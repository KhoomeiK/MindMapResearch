AmItheAsshole,fcqp3l0,t1_fcqk9ih,1577889879.0,This comment should be at the very top. This subreddit is so messed up.
AmItheAsshole,fcqnn4z,t1_fcqg9ry,1577889164.0,Yes it’s like this story is here so ahe can brag about being TA rather than actually wanting advice. She obviously is TA. It’s clickbait.
AmItheAsshole,fcqmhui,t3_eigcs9,1577888615.0,"If you don’t forgive, your suffering will continue. She was trying to own up to what she did and be a better person, and you remained juvenile. Forgiveness is for you, not for them. I think if you would have explained yourself better to her and have been honest, it would have ended well. Try to forgive and move on and the pain will dissipate.
