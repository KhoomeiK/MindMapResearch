transpassing,fdo33rw,t1_fdnnqum,1578598010.0,"I'm AMAB and we have very similar facial features. You have a really strong jaw and high cheekbones, which read masc in my opinion. You have a nice chin too, males tend to have less pointy and more broad ones like yours. I personally like your piercings, but I think they read more feminine to me, except your earrings. I think it's mainly the septum one? It's not really much of an issue though, if you like it, and it'll be even less so when you start growing stubble/face hair.

I think you're doing great already and will do even better when more time passes :)"

You have relatively feminine facial features already, nothing I see here is particularly masculine. A different angle would help judge better though, but overall I think you look fine, especially for no HRT"

I don't know much about makeup, but I recommend trying to darken your eyebrows if you can. Women's eyebrows are generally slightly higher up than men's, and more curved."
transpassing,fd1vpnx,t3_ejvf20,1578137554.0,"I recommend trying a wig, your face is kind of round so a bob cut could suit you. Try looking up accessories for rounder faces. Glasses, hair styles, etc.

Your shoulders are relatively large, but it's not so hard to hide with properly cut tops. Mine are pretty big too, and I've had luck with large sweaters and skinny pants.

You did well with facial hair, there's none to cover up in this picture so keep it like that if you can!"

transpassing,fcofk0x,t3_ei8rt3,1577831020.0,"You have good proportions, the only things that could be clocking you are your chin and slightly visible Adam's Apple. Your glasses are a good fit for your face and they frame your nose too, which could draw people's eyes upwards, which is good.

This is just from the one angle/pic, but overall, I think your features balance out and you look great :)"
