newzealand,ffel3j5,t1_ffeiqhm,1579852602.0,Yep. It's moronic that people can't understand that. I guess that's why Simon is over in the Philippines. Just kill the bludgers and drug addicts?

HadToHurt,ffds3d4,t1_ffcrkzm,1579827538.0,It's worse when you land a jump badly and fall onto the back wheel and your meat and potatoes get sucked into the small gap between the tyre and frame..
HadToHurt,ffdrwyn,t1_ffcqnaf,1579827421.0,As a kid my cousin had a problem where his balls never dropped. If I remember correctly they attach small weights inside that bring them down. He stopped sucking his thumb after they had dropped which I found quite funny.
worldnews,ffdoj2b,t1_ffdgcmn,1579825265.0,I have a number plate like this. Works great if you don't want people getting your plate number.
newzealand,ffdjhh9,t1_ffdilot,1579822184.0,Yeah it could be. Depends completely on how long it takes for him to actually get to you. The thing about needing gas is you normally know when you will need it though and can plan ahead.
newzealand,ffdezeq,t1_ffddcsj,1579819476.0,"Yeah fair point then. If you need gas and it's stopping you from doing something else then that's not convenient.
If you got to work like I do and then ordered it in the morning and didn't need your car until you leave to go home, that's 8 hrs of time where you don't need your car but at the same time you could have it plugged in like an EV."
newzealand,ffdbndl,t1_ffd8h19,1579817416.0,"I imagine the guy pulls up at your work or wherever and throws the gas is. The only inconvenience would be you literally unlocking the car?
I have my gas delivered like this because my brother does just that. Once a week at a certain day/time. This wouldn't work if I used a different amount of fuel every week though obviously. 
I don't imagine it working very well like you describe it where you call him up when you need the gas then and there."
newzealand,ffd78ln,t1_ffd6b2t,1579814779.0,Yeah going to the gas station is a pain in the arse. You can't call plugging it into a wall and waiting hours as a comparison to some guy coming and filling up your vehicle though :)
newzealand,ffd71dw,t1_ffd66k5,1579814670.0,No but you said you can't fill up ICE vehicle instantly which was not correct. Still compared to charging a car the few minutes it takes to fill a normal vehicle might as well be instant.
newzealand,ffd5iuw,t1_ffbmmom,1579813825.0,You just explained exactly why this business delivering fuel is a good idea.
newzealand,ffd5cb6,t1_ffb8hfr,1579813726.0,Have you not seen F1? I would call that near instant.. You certainly can fill up a gas tank very very fast.

fatlogic,ffa8sz3,t1_ffa5sf1,1579730114.0,I mountain bike quite a lot which is cardio intensive. However I found my cardio ability greatly increased when I lifted weights. Probably because my muscles become more efficient by being stronger. There is good crossover.
fatlogic,ffa8jlz,t1_ffa64qe,1579729969.0,It can make a significant difference still. You don't have to become a body builder to see the benefits. It works 24/7 vs cardio which is only working while you are actively doing it. Even if you only burn a few extra calories per hour while resting it's going to add up fast.
fatlogic,ffa5pyw,t1_ffa2qb7,1579728402.0,That's true but building muscle also increases the amount you burn while resting as well which evens up the cardio vs lifting argument.
