I had major surgery on my ankle once. They had to separate my foot :leg bone to fix the inside of my ankle. When I was going to the operating room they stopped right outside and showed me a white board with a fairly long list of names. She told me those were all the med students that would like to observe the surgery and did I mind?  I told her it was fine by me, And that was an ankle, not nearly such a personal place."
