fashionwomens35,ffd2ntn,t3_esxrhv,1579812217.0,I actually bought a custom dress on my honeymoon to Thailand and I can’t wait until it’s warm enough to wear it here! Late winter can’t come soon enough!!!
RussianFood,ffa0lx1,t1_fcuy1iv,1579725471.0,"Also nearby is Anna’s bakery, though both of these are in the city (Ukrainian Village)"
konmari,ff0vc5d,t1_ff0m2uv,1579472645.0,"Folks had time when one member of the household’s full time job was caring for the house (and potentially taking in other home-related jobs into the home like washing or sewing). When you work full time on something other than caring for your home, it feels impossible to really keep up if you also want hobbies or other things that bring you joy."
MEOW_IRL,ff0p705,t3_eqygng,1579470935.0,"My car free feeds and yet she still does this. Though really, it’s my fault for not ensuring the food is properly mounded."
declutter,fep22s3,t1_feljogx,1579310400.0,"I haven’t checked, but I’ll look into that!  I live in a large city with a robust library system so they probably have one of those subscriptions, I’m just new to using a non-university library"
ThailandTourism,fekqao6,t3_epnhgy,1579205390.0,We did a really great private class with clay pot cooking school (found them on Airbnb experiences) in Bangkok. The teacher is great — he’s really knowledgeable and is actually writing his masters on the history and evolution of Thai cooking! Plus he’s sarcastic and funny.
declutter,fekpsls,t1_fekl65b,1579205090.0,Same! I don’t  have room for more books but note I get to read anything I want with the click of a (hold) button!
AskReddit,fekddhi,t1_feixfqm,1579197691.0,"Yes and no. You still have to pay attention because your oven may not be nearly the same temperature as the recipe writers oven so leaving it in for the time on the recipe can over bake or end up raw. This is why so many people say they can’t bake — they blindly follow the recipe instead of watching what their iteration of the recipe is actually doing. But I agree, following the recipe generally gets you like 85% of the way there."
TrollXOver30,fegvchn,t1_fegrg75,1579103362.0,"Oh my gosh, are you me? Just about everything down to trivia last night is me!

Honestly, I have the same struggle. I’ve started trying to schedule down time out of the house once a month, which is not enough, but at least it’s something. Usually either a massage if I find a Groupon off taking myself to coffee. But if I’m at home I feel like I should be doing something."
TrollXChromosomes,fe33ypz,t1_fe05r6b,1578845693.0,Exactly! In between a C and D cup usually and I have quite small breasts by volume. I just also have a “frighteningly small rib cage “ according to my husband.
Zoomies,fe2x8zp,t1_fe2lzl8,1578843883.0,That’s what my cat used to sound like and it’s the cutest! Now she just yells at me to run up and down the building stairs
cats,fdoocjj,t1_fdndmsr,1578609271.0,"Imagine that, but it’s an 8 hour flight (plus the drive to the airport and most of the 2 hours before takeoff). Then you have my cat when we moved both to and from Germany. And the whole way I’m both trying to appease other passengers and comfort her with “it’s OK honey. You’re ok”."
ThailandTourism,fdlg45q,t3_elze45,1578523282.0,We stayed at the renaissance and it is awesome. Rooftop pool and one floor below there is the executives lounge that has a great view. Totally loved it and I’m a a very easy location near the BTS
bon_appetit,fdex6ix,t1_fdepigf,1578348482.0,"So excited for this! My husband is vegetarian so for all intents and purposes I cook vegetarian and I’m excited for additional recipes from BA! 

On a related note, Priya’s book is fantastic — all but 4 recipes are vegetarian!"
declutter,fdbxmr2,t1_fdav2wm,1578263532.0,"Omg this is my life. About 15 months ago my husband became a vegetarian and we decided to only consume any meat we had already purchased so as not to waste it. I threw out a BUNCH of chicken, turkey, unknown’s red meat last week. It has to be almost two years old!!!!!"
AskReddit,fd9ydjf,t1_fd8puds,1578239549.0,"Yes! We had a New Years Party last week and folks were here until almost 3am. Kitty was losing her little mind because I was not in bed and, in fact, a stranger (friend’s 2 year-old) was in my bed. Visitors are fine but they should be gone well before bed time according to Snickers."
cats,fd4pmgi,t1_fd3ht9o,1578169823.0,"They all think they want to be adventure kitties, but mine at least always quickly remembers she enjoys her pampered life."
cats,fd2gs9o,t3_ejv6y1,1578147001.0,"Some are definitely lounger’s but not my girl: she survives on sunshine and attention. If she can be on my lap, or ideally lying on my face, she will be. When I tell her no I can see her little heart breaking."
