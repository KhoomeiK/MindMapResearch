You're not the only one who ""pushes harder"" which is the reason why they try to read what you're saying instead of answering your question."
fatlogic,feq864e,t1_feouifu,1579338721.0,"It's extremely difficult to treat anorexia. Their goal is to help you achieve a healthy weight and be CONTENT with it and not severely depressed because you see yourself as fat. I don't know what you mean exactly by ""get better"" but this is really what those ppl want.  They also have to be very carefully of EVERYTHING they say because it gets twisted all the time by their patients."

unpopularopinion,fco2rvc,t1_fcn2eaz,1577822990.0,You're right. But this is so difficult for people. No one knows what to do with someone else's pain. We want to make it better and if we can't we want to ignore it as quickly as possible because it makes us feel powerless and inadequate. Just tell ppl I WANT YOU TO LISTEN. I don't want your opinion and your advice. Some of them will
unpopularopinion,fco29zq,t1_fcmz1y7,1577822750.0,This is their guilt talking. When my brother killed himself ppl who hadn't seen him in years were really upset and felt guilty. People who hardly knew him felt sad and guilty. It was so weird. Just ignore them or show them compassion.
unpopularopinion,fco1uc9,t3_ehzpzi,1577822548.0,"Sometimes the way you do it could be a bit selfish. I once met a woman who told me that one sunny Sunday morning she her husband and their 2 children got ready to go out. They went out and the husband said,  I forgot my hat. Went back inside climbed to the attic and jumped off the window onto the pavement in the back garden. Or a woman in my neighbourhood who was home alone with her 4 children between 4 and 14 and killed herself in the garage. Or my brother who killed himself on his wife's birthday (although he was psychotic at the time and without medication). When I think about it,  wanting to die is one thing, but take your children to your mother first or something."

fatlogic,fbv0tpi,t1_fbuh4dq,1577123535.0,I never get why an obese person is gonna drink a smoothie or eat protein bar or whatever after working out. You just don't need it.
