politics,ffdsb4e,t3_ess2y5,1579827683.0,"If they're already detained, which is bad enough, why hurt them even more? 

It's not human. Think of it this way- you're gathering up the Jews and putting them in camps, along with gays and gypsies. That's shit.

But then hurt them etc? I can vaguely understand the reasoning behind the racism, but the torture?

If you want to off people, do it (you bunch of cunts). But don't torture them beforehand!"

The man is orange. Not black, white or shades between.

He is orange.

Orange.

Some reptiles are orange. Perhaps, and I'm not saying it's true, but perhaps if aliens where there, in our history, and some speculate, aliens actually visited our planet and gave us pyramids and clocks *nobody knows how clocks work- ALIENS are running our government!!!!!
