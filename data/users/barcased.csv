EDIT: It seems American Redditors opt to downvote people (trying to bury their comments) who present facts about how their military/government commits war crimes, and how media covers them up (deliberately or not, they do not fact check them).

Now, check this link.  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/318621.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/318621.stm) 

This is pretty much how CNN presented the ""incident"" as well. I regrettably cannot find the link on their site right now.

>Describing the attack, Gen Clark said that that the pilot had seen a flash of movement - but **it had been too late to abort**. ""You can see if you were focusing right on your job as a pilot **how suddenly that train appeared**,"" said the General. ""It was really unfortunate."" 

Why is that link important? It is dated 13. April 1999, one day after the ""incident"". Try to find anywhere in the article a single mention of the video being sped up. There is none.

Now, check this link.  [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/594800.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/594800.stm) 

That one is dated 7. January 2000, 9 months after the ""incident"". 

>He (Jamie O'Shea) said the **video's speed was doubled** after it went through a target analysis computer, to expedite the processing of hundreds of other videos of Nato's raids. But it was not returned to normal screen before the press screening. 

What has changed? Well, follow this link.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grdelica\_train\_bombing#Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grdelica_train_bombing#Controversy) 

>The German Frankfurter Rundschau prompted a further controversy during **January 2000**, when it reported that the NATO video had been shown at **three times its real speed**, giving a misleading impression of the train's speed. The Pentagon and NATO stated that the error had been the result of the video being speeded up for battle damage assessment purposes, but not being slowed again for the press conference. **Later investigation by Frankfurter Rundschau asserted that the video was sped up 4.7 times.**

&#x200B;

So, instead of having only 2.3 seconds to react to the train's ""sudden"" approach, the pilot had **10.87 seconds** to prevent that kahm ""incident"" kahm. But even with the ample time to abort, he launched the second missile which ""accidentally"" hit the train again... because... the train... slid forward...

Alright, here is my country - Serbia. We are in a horrible spot, economically, politically, w/e-wise. Our health-care system is plagued with understaffed clinics, not enough doctors, nurses, workers. We have issues with pretty much everything. Is that the problem that is being caused by social healthcare? No. It is a problem of being in a civil war, under sanctions, bombed, etc.

Now, what happens in Serbia when you get sick? You go to a GP. You can reserve a spot via phone or the internet. A doctor will take a look and depending on symptoms send you (or not) to a specialist. You, then, visit a specialist who will determine (hopefully) what is wrong with you.

What happens if for any reason you cannot be admitted in due time or, perhaps, the waiting list for MRI, CT, w/e is too long? Well, you go to a private clinic. You pay. But, there is more. You get those bills, turn them in to the appropriate authorities and get a FULL REFUND. Why? Because the county couldn't provide you with service in time and is obligated to compensate you.

> why do so many come to the states to be seen when they have free healthcare? 

Because if you have a lot of money, you will pay for the 'best' doctors. And the best doctors can be found in the clinics which pay them in 6 figures. And they pay them in 6 figures because they earn 6 figures from their patients. An ordinary person will not. They will not be able to afford that and if they are from the USA, they will just roll over and die.

Since you wish 'true stories' to be heard - here is one. All of my friends who live in the US (and they live there for years; some of them more than 20), find it cheaper to buy a return plane ticket to Serbia, get their teeth fixed here and fly back."
