She complained to me sometimes that she’s broke while charging $100+ items on credit.

She complained to me once and I told her to not buy expensive things. And she went off on me “Not all of us make as much money as you to buy them in cash.” And I’m like, “YEAH that’s a good reason to NOT be charging them on credit when you can’t even pay them back.”"
povertyfinance,ffh8dtu,t1_ffgbt7u,1579926042.0,"Your comment doesn’t actually change the definition: lacking sufficient money to live at a standard considered comfortable or normal in a society. 

Literally NOT a state of mind. Being sad is a state of mind. Being angry is a state of mind. Being poor is a physical thing where you don’t have enough money physically.

You might as well say being homeless is a state of mind."
povertyfinance,ffh82e1,t3_er1qws,1579925771.0,"This is a terrible post.

Look, if you wanna but a latte once in a while, okay. But if you’re buying them daily or weekly, it adds up really fast. Even a latte a week, $5 * 52 = $260. Quite a lot for people in poverty. Instead of putting $5 a week on a latte, put that $5 in a savings or jar. Maybe a latte once every few weeks.

I’m not saying you can splurge on yourself once in a while, but all the time, every week? I recommend you don’t.

Heck, I hesitate buying Starbucks when I found out it’s like $6.50 with Soy Milk and I make a lot of money. And $6.50 is too painful for me to spend on a drink."

Idk how it starts, but I would open a Word file: edit and save it as usual. Rarely, after saving, the Word program becomes white as if it froze and then unfreezes itself. The file name becomes some strange string (only noticeable if you look up in the window where the file name is shown), and closing the file automatically deleted the original Word file.

Happened to me 3 times at work last year.

I observed it myself when I saved the field to my desktop, and after closing, the file deleted itself. Not in the trash can; nowhere to be found."

Learning to make iOS apps with Swift is another thing.

It’s like learning English. You can use it to make some sentences. But knowing how to apply English to write a book is something else.

At first, I also only did brute solutions that weren’t as clever. But the more I practiced and looked up the solutions, I started improving.

I became happy when I solved 2 problems the first try with efficient solutions without looking up for help.

The more you practice, and the more you keep a knowledge of various data structures and their pros and cons, the easier it will be to see solutions better than brute force ones."

One time I was the night manager for a grocery store. There were only like 3 of us here. It was near closing time. One of the cashiers informed me that a man with blood all over his white shirt just walked into the store and went to the restroom. 

I didn’t believe her since she was known to joke a lot. 

And lo and behold, someone walks out of the restroom with blood on their clothes as if they just murdered somebody. They walked out of the store.

I went to the restroom and there was blood drops with water mixed around as if he tried to clean himself.

This is really a problem with teams/developers, not storyboards.

I’m part of the team that merges pull requests. We have over 15 different iOS teams. Probably once in 2 years we had a conflict with a storyboard and never again. And I would know since I’m the one who fixes the conflicts since I manage the CICD.

Hard work isn’t the only requirement to success.

You got lucky being able to study between 12 to 20. When I was that age, I was working. Going to school in the morning and then at night go help my parents clean buildings until bedtime.

You’re assuming that there’s opportunity. There isn’t everywhere. Many people live in places where learning skills me and you did are not applicable in their area. You also forgot that job competition exists. There will always be people who didn’t get the job. Someone getting a job means many didn’t."
