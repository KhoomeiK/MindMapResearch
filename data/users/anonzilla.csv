So if he said “in my experience China is a dystopian shithole” that seems like it would be fine according to your personal standards, which begs the question of why it would be significantly different if I said “in my experience that attitude is typical of bigoted and intellectually lazy CCJers”. Is it just that when we make bigoted, prejudiced, or “offensive” remarks of any sort that we merely need to preface it with “in my experience”? Or maybe this is more nuanced?
