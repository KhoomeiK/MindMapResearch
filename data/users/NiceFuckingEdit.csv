nonprofit,fezqqzq,t3_er09y7,1579460461.0,"It sounds like you're very much overthinking this.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with entertaining other offers in this situation. If I were you I would investigate those organizations pursuing you and get concrete offer letters from them.

I would then approach your current CEO and board about those new offers and look to get a promotion to COO or something right underneath CEO and start learning the ropes.  

If they are unwilling to work with you on a promotion now I would take one of the other offers.

Unfortunately in the nonprofit world there is a lot of people that think they can manipulate people to stick around because of the charitable nature of the work.

Don't let anyone take advantage of your good nature. Get yours and keep kicking ass."
