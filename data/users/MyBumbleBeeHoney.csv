Which is why after a many year hiatus I am finishing with the software engineering degree, I still love economics and finance but even my masters won't be in that, it will be in applied statistics which will be more useful. If finance is what you want to do sometimes a whole different degree set is actually the way to get there, not the degree named after it. And that's what they don't tell you."

Sorry if they lied to you and told you that if you major in finance that you will be some hot shot working on wall street."
