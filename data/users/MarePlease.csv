I know my therapist recommends me seeing and riding my horse, which is why I‚Äôm fighting so hard to keep her. Sometimes a doctors recommendation can do wonders."
gofundme,fdecyo5,t3_ekx4iu,1578336310.0,"I‚Äôm in your shoes with no job and unable to work due to mental illness (depression, anxiety and panic attacks). I set up a gofundme to help me pay vet bills for my horse because of the stress it is causing me and she is a form of therapy for me. 
It sounds to me like some time away would be therapy for you. Why not talk to your therapist and get it where they are on your side. I think more people would be willing to help with a medical opinion backing you up.
I do agree your boyfriend is not helping the situation and could be making it worse since you have zero control over your life from what I can tell."

dogs,fcyw9cf,t3_ejiwuy,1578088461.0,I‚Äôm so sorry for everything going on with your baby. I know in horses cushings is easily monitored and ‚Äútreatable‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure in dogs. I know a few people who have had cats and dogs with diabetes and it was easily controllable. I hope this helps.
dogs,fcyw54s,t1_fcyk6d6,1578088387.0,Thank you for giving information on dealing with these problems. I know about cushings in horses but never heard of it in dogs. What happens? Is it controllable?
AnimalsBeingBros,fcyvw9q,t3_ejidao,1578088229.0,Definitely a scam by deers but at least they‚Äôre being polite about it.

SuicideWatch,fcyv9y6,t1_fcya7dl,1578087838.0,What type of part time job would pay enough? I‚Äôm curious for myself as it seems when I was working full time I couldn‚Äôt support myself making $17.00 an hour.
SuicideWatch,fcyv6jo,t3_ejjdgq,1578087780.0,"I can relate to this being a graduate with three degrees that I don‚Äôt use. A lot of people seem to live to work and not work to live. I don‚Äôt want that existence either and am not cut out to deal with the stress of most jobs. Sadly the low stress jobs just don‚Äôt pay. I wish I could tell you it gets better but to honest I‚Äôm still waiting. Maybe you will find something you love and a career you enjoy, don‚Äôt give up yet."

service_dogs,fcx5ybt,t3_ejae3f,1578052609.0,I would think they would be allowed to bring their SD. Wouldn‚Äôt it be discrimination otherwise? If someone can live there with a SD I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt visit with one. Just my thought.
Awwducational,fcvxlgu,t3_ej0700,1578012401.0,I‚Äôve also heard they are quite loving to their keepers and can be cuddly

Usually he goes to Disney with me as I have issues with crowds and panic attacks, I‚Äôm wondering if Disney will get stricter on what dogs they let in. As far as I know a letter isn‚Äôt required to be shown for any true SD."
SuicideWatch,fcvc2q9,t3_ej15bc,1577998967.0,Glad something stopped you and I hope you have an amazing 2020. Stay strong and you got this!
service_dogs,fcu9tkm,t1_fctfn9u,1577975954.0,Thank you for being one of the better staff/managers there during your time working there. It‚Äôs appreciated by those who follow the rules.
service_dogs,fcu9q8d,t3_eis2jx,1577975888.0,"That is ridiculous! I think they even have a sign saying all pets must be on leash. I also feel that people with small dogs don‚Äôt think they have to follow the same rules because their dogs are ‚Äúsmall‚Äù or ‚Äútoo small to hurt anyone‚Äù. They don‚Äôt realize that their dogs could get hurt and that yes their dogs can hurt other dogs. 

My SD would have broken and wanted to play if that had happened especially without his vest on. You have a great dog and I‚Äôm sorry you had that happen to you. I agree with the other comments and speak to a manager or call corporate and say something."

service_dogs,fcl27mm,t3_ehop02,1577738207.0,There are some leashes and collars out there in yellow that say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nervous‚Äù or ‚Äúask to pet‚Äù. I‚Äôve also heard about tying a yellow ribbon to their leash or collar as a warning to people. If you did get a vest I would go with yellow and custom patches so your baby isn‚Äôt confused with other SD‚Äôs in training. Good luck and I hope you can socialize your baby.

I want to cry for no reason and just sleep all day. My mom yells at me because she feels I‚Äôm not getting better or trying to improve. She doesn‚Äôt understand how hard it is for me to just go to therapy or do the chores she wants me to do. And that sometimes taking a shower can drain my energy.
