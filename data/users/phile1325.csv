dating_advice,ffbs5hd,t1_ffbrpb9,1579780671.0,"yeah exactly. And I always feel pathetic afterwards because it feels like Im the only one that is so desperate next to all these completly healthy and balanced people. And since girls tend to never make a move by themselves the only option you have is to either let go and drown in your fucking thoughts or ask them out to do something and risk a rejection. And since I really am afraid of being rejected again, I choose first option almost always. Im just so fucking tired of this situation. I see beautiful girls all the time and everywhere I go and everyone around me seems to get in and out of relationships like its nothing. And here I am overthinking when a girl touches me. Its ridiculous because its like you are starving while swimming in food lol."
dating_advice,ffbr3v8,t1_ffbqht1,1579779404.0,"yeah 100%. Exactly what I do all the time. I overthink everything. I always begin to fantasize about being in a relationship with the girl, doing things together and kissing her and so on. It doesnt matter how hard I try I cant supress the thoughts. Its just until I meet them again when the resignation kicks in. Obviously the girls arent that desperate and when they dont act like i was expexting it, I instantly tell myself that I was misinterpreting her signals and that she isnt actually attracted to me. Then i start to feel like shit because I know that my desperation created false hopes that just get shattered over and over again with basically every girl i meet. I dont even get to the point where I would ask them out because my mind tells me that I know shes not interested and I shouldnt make a fool of myself. So basically my pride and fear of rejection and awkwardness keep me from anything. Its fucked up because I know that I dont know anything about what these girls think but the doubts are so fucking dominant. Its exhausting.."

Atm i always feel very attracted to some girls I meet, probably out of desperation. I work as a bartender at a dancing school and a lot of attractive girls work there too. Some of them seemed to be attracted to me. They touch me all the time and try to make smalltalk. One even asked me out to dance. When this happens i get desperate af and the girl alwase occupies my mind for the next few days. Its ridiculous because i dont know them in the slightest way but I think at this point even the slightest sign of attraction is enough to give me hope of finally getting a girlfriend.

AskReddit,feg4lbu,t1_fef2l46,1579076654.0,"Yes thats what I said. The genes determine the structure of our bodies and brain. The structure of the brain basically determines what happens when the brain reacts to its environment. But you cant control either of these factors. The structure of the brain is predetermined by your genes and gets influenced by your surroundings which you cant control neither. You can only consciously experience the brains reaction to its environment because our consciousness is a part of our brain. Its like a watch tower that observes certain parts of the brains activity. There are still things in our brain that not even we ourselves notice. Subconscius processes for example. They too have a tremendous influence on our behavior. Just another factor that is out of our control. The conscious mind has the power of registering the a certain amount of deciscions our brain makes, which, if you look at it, is also only a reaction of our nervous cells in our brain to certain factors from the outside. So even if we were to choose between different alternatives, its nothing we have control over. Because what we choose is decided by cells in our brain. And cells have a set of genes that basically determine how they act to certain situations. Therefor I believe that we get the illusion of free will eventhough its just mistaken as us being able to register certain decisions being made, without having any influence to consciously influence these decisions. I think when we realise that we make a decision, the decision is already made and our conscience has kinda of a delay, like a guy that watches a livestream which has a delay of a few seconds."
AskReddit,feg41do,t1_fef2dpm,1579075946.0,"I think what it all comes down to is the question what ""you' are. Because from all what we know, our mental processes, including speaking and thinking are just chemical reactions in our brain. Reactions only happen if there is something triggering them. Our brain is a pile of nervous cells that just react to the stimuli from the world around us. Depending on the stimuli the brain changes basically. But given that, our brain, which basically is responsible for everything we do and think, is just a reactive mass thats reaction is dependent on the environments stimuli and its own structure. So theoretically, if youd know everything about our environment and also everything about ones brain, you could determing its reaction and therefor the persons decisions.
And people murdering other people isnt evidence for a free will. There is always a reason why people murder others and often, people who become a killer have a similar childhood full of abuse and problems. So they had a similar environment."
AskReddit,fef26mf,t1_fef1u9a,1579046422.0,"well keep going this way. It will eventually come down to, wasnt it your decision to be born? No it wasnt and neither are my decisions.

AskReddit,fef1pn7,t1_fef17wf,1579046109.0,"But ""free"" means independent from outside factors right? We are part of the universe around us and react to our environment. The way we react is determined by our genes, so where does the free will fit in? It just doesnt make any sense because without something happening to you you couldnt react to it. But as you know you dont have control over the things that happen to you. If i wouldnt have made this post you wouldnt have answered to it. Therefor you are not free but lead by your environment and your genes."

AskReddit,fef0gk5,t1_feezca0,1579045280.0,"Its hard to describe but how do you know that your decisions are not already determined before you can realise them? I mean ""free"" means that its independent from factors that are coming from the outside, right? So I believe that we are a product of our genes and our environment. We are a blueprint that reacts to the worls around it and our ""decisions"" are the manifestation of our actions aka the result of the clash of our genes with our environment. Personally i dont see any space for a free will in this game. I believe that we are what we consciously experience. But we neither have influence over our genes nor do we over our environment. So all we can do is observe what happens with ourselves and the free will is the illusion of control that keeps us going."

Everytime I looked at her i caught her looking at me and when she noticed me looking at her she would always quickly turn her eyes away. I thought she might be shy but I took the eye contact as a sign that she is interested in me so after the last movie she went out to grab her clothes from a wardrobe and I took my whole courage and went up to her. I introduced myself to her and said that I thought she looked very good and asked her if she wanted to go out for a coffee sometime. She forced her eyes close and grinned like this way you do when you dont want to deny an offer but have to and told me that unfortunatly she was in a relationship. I responded that this was too bad and told her she should just take it as a compliment then. She smiled and said thank you and added that it was really cool from me to come up to her and then we said bye and went our ways. It was a total rejection but I felt so good afterwards. It was the first time that ive asked out a girl I didnt know at all and eventhough she rejected me, her response gave me hope and made me very happy somehow. She was so nice and I saw her a few times again. She would always smile at me.

But your partner seems to be very mature about it and seems to care, so I think communication is key. Maybe you can just tell her that you are insecure about it. I think the most important thing is to let her know that you dont pull back because of her. You know imagine you really like someone and he/she pulls back. First instinct would be to doubt yourself right? Like, is it because of my body, or face or am i too ugly or whatever. So yeah be honest with her and tell her that you need to take it slow but that you want to get more intimate. If shes mature shell understand and help you to lose your insecurities.

But believe me most peoples lifes are very boring. We get a wrong picture through social media which suggests that all the exciting people out there are living a fullfilled and 100% happy life and travel all the time. They all look good and you can easily feel inferior when you are bombarded with these pictures and videos of people enjoying expensive trips and beautiful partners. But like with everything on social media its just the facade and there is something behind every facade they dont want us to see.
Everyone has their problems, just because they dont show them doesnt mean they arent there. Furthermore I think that many people use social media as an escape or compensation for a not really fulfilling reality. If you seek validation on social media chances are high you are nowhere as happy as you want to make others think.

dating_advice,fdf64ay,t1_fdf4hlv,1578354174.0,"Ok that is probably a sign that he doesnt know what he wants. He probably is confused about himself and his mental health doesnt help that at all. I know its hard but If I was you i would try to move on. Blocking you is very immature and I think its not worth to pursue someone like him in this case. Also him saying he is ready for a relationship but you arent sound like projection to me. As from what you are writing I get the impression that you would be ready for a relationship if he would communicate his love to you. But he seems to be the one who is unsure about what he is feeling. So maybe he uses you as a emotional dumbster for his problems, and, sorry if this sounds rough, it might be a codependency. Since you seem to still want to be at least friends with him, it makes the impression that he somehow is very important to you. You said you dont really have a social life. Maybe hes your portal to the social world? I know this are only assumptions but its weird to me that you still want to be with him eventhough he blocked you and you havent talked for two weeks. Normally thats a sign that cant be misinterpreted. If you get blocked the person obviously doesnt want to talk to you anymore and the only thing to do is to move on. 

I think at first you have to figure out the reasons why you are still attached to him eventhough he made it clear that he doesnt want to talk to you anymore. Feel free to share your thoughts with me btw. 

Given the reasons you find, you should ask yourself if it is healthy for you to still try to pursue him.

dating_advice,fdf4rsl,t3_el21nz,1578353294.0,Dont do dating apps at all is my recommendation. Most women on there only seek validation and are not interested in real relationships.

dating_advice,fdf4m5g,t3_el299j,1578353190.0,"I think that is exactly what you should try to do. If she is interested she will reach out to you. If not, well you should move on anyway. There is no point chasing a girl."
dating_advice,fdf42f8,t3_el22c5,1578352830.0,"God level would be 100% authenticity. I know someone from my class in uni who is really open about himself and therefor quite authentic. I remember him sitting next to me and suddenly he turned around and told me in front of many others, that everyone was weird this day. It was so funny because it seemed like the others got that same vibe. I would never have the guts to say something in front of other people but I think the key is to just not care.If you have a conversation with other people dont focus on keeping it. It makes no sense. If there is nothing to talk about then dont talk. However there are some things that you can always talk about with almost everyone.

1. Job
2. Family
3. Experiences

Sometimes it can be a good opener if you just playfully assume something about someone. For example if you want to talk to a girl and you notice something about her, say that she seems like a certain type of girl for example. Persume something about her. This will make her curious and shell ask why you think that. Based on this you can have a good conversation. Also theres a trick that avoids you from getting these awkward silences. If you dont know what to say and youre talking partner doesnt know either, look around and pick anything. A chair, flower, another person, whatever you see and think of what this remembers you of. That is what you tell the other person and they most certainly have something to say too.

&#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to say something about the dating apps. I think it doesnt really matter how you introduce yourself. Dating apps are all about looks. If you match a girl, you can write basically anything. If she likes how you look shell make an effort to keep the conversation going and if not, well youre fucked, theres nothing you can do. Dont try. Dont think about what youre going to say just say what is on your mind and either shes attracted to you, then it will go by itself or not then youll get no response."
dating_advice,fdf39j7,t1_fdf18fk,1578352311.0,"Hmm that seems really complicated. It seems like he might have problems with attachment. I mean your whole post gives me the vibe that he is afraid of having the responsibility of committing to you 100%. Thats why he cant give you a certain answer to the question you wish to have certainty about. Asking him if he wants to be friends with you is equivalent to pressuring him into making a decision between either friend or boyfriend. Maybe he really likes you but has problems with the thought of him having certain responsibilities if hes ""officially"" your boyfriend? 

To me the problems seems to be that you want to have certainty about what you two are. You want to have a definite answer. He however seems to not want to give you a definite answer for whatever reason. You mentioned that he said that he wanted to care about his mental health and that he had anxiety/depression? This might be a factor. Im not a psychologist but damaged mental health almost always leads to difficult relationships and problems with other people. Can you tell me a bit more about it? (Of course only if this doesnt go too far in terms of his/your privacy)."
dating_advice,fdf24ig,t3_el17au,1578351572.0,I think many people still are not able to deal with their problems themselves. I think this is the main reason why there are still so many bad relationships and also why there are still so many bad parents. Many relationships fail because people are not ready for it and use it to dump their problems on someone else.
dating_advice,fdf1udu,t3_el1dtx,1578351392.0,"Hey man I can relate. I dont have this racial pressure youre talking about but Im 20yo and I can heavily relate to the craving of being adored and wanted by someone. It sucks to not have someone you can share your deepest thoughts, fears, wishes and dreams with. 

I think hitting on girls why you are working is definitly not a good idea. Its one thing to hit on a worker but to hit on someone while at work can bring you in serious trouble. 

But you dont have to restrict yourself to date only one race. You might have pressure from society and your family but eventually your goal should be to find a perfect partner and if this person is out of your race, then thats how it is. Also you shouldnt feel guilt for not finding everyone from your race attractive. We like what we are used to see so it makes perfect sense that you might find caucasian girls more attractive then girls from your race. 

Youre still a teenager so you shouldnt resignate yet. You have a lot of time to figure everything out and to find someone who fits you. Youre situation maybe shit atm but youll get out of it. Try to find activities where you can get to know girls on an eye to eye level. I started to dance recently and I can really recommend it. Many women there, and high potential because you touch each other and can easily build connections."
dating_advice,fdf0nli,t3_el1fcz,1578350645.0,"You mean in general or with one girl? 

I think if your post refers to the general problem of men having to make the first move, its never too much. This wont change and theres no way around it. 

If you mean the effort regarding one girl, I think there is no certain duration or sign of when to stop. If a person is genuinly interested in you, this person will make a move by themselves. You will almost always have to make the first move and you should ask them out and stuff. I think the best indicator is if girls want to go out with you when you ask them or not. If they agree instantly chances are high they like you and even very introverted girls will say yes because they cant get up the courage to ask you out, so they are lucky to be able to avoid this responsibility. 

If you have to ask out a girl and she says she cant and doesnt make an effort to find another day then this is a red flag. Like, when you give them the chance and they dont even try to take it, move on."
dating_advice,fdf000g,t3_el1fdv,1578350237.0,"I dont have enough info to judge this situation in a satisfying level but it sounds to me as if he had feelings for you and waited for you to confess yours. The claim ""there wasnt intimacy to get into a bf/gf relationship"" sounds like a demand for you to invest more into your relationship. Maybe he was unsure about how you feel. When you texted him and said you wanted to be friends he couldve understand that as a rejection of his feelings for you. Like he realised hes being friendzoned so he got mad. Being friends doesnt work if there is sexual chemistry between the two of you. I believe, from the info of your post, that he had feelings for you and felt rejected after you said you wanted to be friends."

ForeverAlone,fdex3gk,t1_fdewi5r,1578348429.0,thats brutal but I agree 100%. Biology is still the main factor in dating and it doesnt matter how hard you try but you cant get anyone to act against their basic sexual instincts. There will always be losers and winners. But I think the ratio between winners and losers has become worse in the last decades. Women dont need men anymore so only the extreme good looking or extremly rich men have a value. All the other average men are replaceable and offer nothing that wants a woman to stay with him. If she can get a better one she will leave you and theres nothing you can do about it.
ForeverAlone,fdewk3n,t1_fdeukob,1578348093.0,No hes just a dude that talks about the dynamics between men and women and interviews a lot of women to show them. Hes kind of a dating coach but more on the explaining side of things. He doesnt tell you how to pick up girls and rather explains why its so difficult and sheds light on modern dating problems and so on. If youre interested I can really recommend watching some of his other videos too!
ForeverAlone,fde90qk,t3_ekscch,1578333827.0,"opening up is still dangerous. Even if girls tell you its not a problem and men should cry, they still see it as a weakness. Opening up about your feelings, especially when its something bad like depression or anxiety gives them power over you. If you dont trust them 100% Id recommend being extremly careful talking about your feelings. Women are the ones that want a dumbster for their drama and problems. They cant afford a boyfriend that has his own problems most of the time. If you have to talk to someone about your feelings its better to do it with someone you either trust completly or a professional. Like I said, when you talk to girls about something like this chances are high they will be pushed away or they will use this against you one day. Emotions are the female weapons and the if you dont give them the ammunition they dont have anything to fire at you."
dating_advice,fde87cz,t1_fde7vg8,1578333314.0,Exactly lol. Exactly the feeling I get often times. There has to be one thing that prevents me from getting dates. One thing that somehow is completly below my radar. Almost like a sign or so that tells other person that im not dateable. Not because of anything that is wrong with me. Just not dateable. Its fucking annoying but maybe well figure it out eventually :D
dating_advice,fde5vei,t3_eku7tu,1578331855.0,"Damn thats exactly my experience. When I was younger about 15 or so I did some romantic stuff with girls now and then. Nothing more than going to the movies or eating ice cream together but it was a date at least. I was always super skinny and I was often told. So i started to go to the gym because it really bothered me. Today, im 20 now, Im in really good shape and I also take care of many other things, skin, my teeth, beard, hair, clothes and so on. I think im average looking and I also made some improvements in regards to my social life because I too used to just play video games all day when I was younger. So my development is extremly positive. But just as in your case, the romantic side of things seemed to completely dissapear when I started consciously working on myself. I see girls checking me out now and then but no girl ever makes the first step and even when I make efforts with a girl and ask her out or flirt with her I cant get a date. Many girls flirt with me and im quite confident in teasing them and making them laugh but somehow no girl wants me on a romantic level. I dont get it. I guess Ill just continue working and maybe one day Ill find someone."

AskReddit,fd3tkr3,t1_fd3quqp,1578161522.0,thanks for the source dude. I have to admit there are some things that seem pretty racist to me lol :D
AskReddit,fd3tgwy,t1_fd3qbe9,1578161490.0,thanks. However this seems to me as if trump tries to argue that he was treated unfairly because the judge being from mexico is biased because trump is building a wall. I dont think that is racism. He says that his heritage is a factor that drives him to be anti trump. I think he has a solid point there. But yeah you could lay it out as racism i have to admit that.
