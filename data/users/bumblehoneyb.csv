The walls are a rich, warm, dark wood and the lighting is a dim ambiance. I can't make out the furniture, but the bar has a variety of dark green bottles on the back wall and the counter is polished. There's liquor for cocktails beneath the counter and the bartender wears a grey t-shirt and decent jeans, white apron in front, tied at his waist."

TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fdoy2z5,t3_em3egh,1578615508.0,"Sorry, I panicked and deleted the post.

The threat from the government employee was the straw that broke the camels back, I came in with my boss apologizing for what i went through and asking for my official statement. The phone was ringing off the hook with calls from heads of this government department, and I found out a lot more details. The department is just rude all across the board. The guests, their heads, the people working with both of my higher-ups...

So I was a perfect excuse.

Not only did my professionalism cover my ass, but recording the incident in this post made my statement more accurate. The head of the department came to personally escort the threat-making woman, they looked at the cameras, took my statement, and now we finally have a leg to stand on when we say ""your department is destroying our hotel"".

It was pretty scary to realize how high up this situation went, and made for a stressful day for everyone involved. Apparently the head was the worst of the entire branch, and my incident was the only time she'd been civil to us. She apologized for her trainee, and while they are now evicted, disciplinary action is being taken on said employee. I have a less dramatic and more professional version of the post on draft though, and might re-post in the future. Just wanted an update, and an explanation why I didn't feel like leaving it up would be a good idea."

rpghorrorstories,fdlb8e6,t3_elv29a,1578520328.0,"My first character ever was ""that"" bard. A pole-dancing flirtatious pink-haired glamour bard. I loved bards, and I loved him. I wanted to change him over time into a real heroic spirit, grow his character, and asked multiple times if my partners were okay with my character's antics. When they said no, I stopped.

We did a one-off, I made a college of whispers bard who had a canary companion and was cursed to always smile by a hag. You could never tell if he was serious or sarcastic, genuine or fake, and he was a level or two in rogue.

My next one was going to be a college of swords dressed-in-white musketeer, a towering woman with a long flowing ponytail and two saint Bernard companions. I had an idea for valor and lore as well, I loved bards...

However, my one bard was enough for one player to bar me from ever playing a bard again. I wanted my next character to be a rat shifter bard-druid but he banned bards so I did rogue. I gushed about wanting to play my musketeer bard and he vetoed it, I tried my hand at a bardlock gambler, vetoed, because:

""bards are broken""

""bards are all perverts""

""bards are all happy-go-lucky""

""they're too cartoony""

""bards are overly-sexual""

""i hate bards""

It should be noted that when I play bards ""bards are broken"" and when he tries bards ""bards aren't good at anything"". Anyone else can play a bard, but me? Banned. He thinks that I should play other classes and not limit myself, he thinks that's the honorable way to play. I'm not here to argue whether or not that's a true statement, but I am pissed he'd try to force me to play his way. I've done barbarians and wizards, rogues and druids, I just love bards."

AskReddit,fdf5yg1,t1_fde4u92,1578354067.0,"We usually get our reviews done at the same time as raises are announced. Last year I got glowing marks, and before my immediate higher-up left she insisted she wanted me to get a 16% raise, which would be crucial in whether or not I can finally go back to school.

She left, and the raise/review came, and my boss said nothing for improvement or critique, just that I was getting a 3% raise. I was stunned, I had my full speech ready, an argument for my case, but that was just a slap in the face. I got it up around a 6% raise after ""negotiating"" but I'm still insulted.

I asked ""what do I do to get at least a 12% raise."" she only said ""you can take on another task/more responsibility"" but I know I'm being underpaid in this position. Part of me wants to work hard and get numbers/evidence to say ""now I deserve that raise!"", the other part of me wonders why my endless overtime during peak seasons, being denied vacation for six months because I keep working the hours no one else wants, getting punted around so my sleep schedule is nonexistent, why any of that isn't enough."
