depression,ff2fi72,t1_ff1jrmu,1579503953.0,"oh fuck off just because you don’t have to be interesting doesn’t mean just settle for what you have, that’s why most of us are fucking depressed in the first place because who we are currently really sucks. 

Yeah you’re right those people you named are just as human as the rest of us but they have passions and energy and are driven towards goals. Most of us can’t find a reason to leave our rooms. 

So really, the only option is change. And while yes the only way to change is to accept who are but you certainly can’t be complacent with it, that’s exactly where depressions stems from, in fact that’s what it is. Recognizing yourself but instead of fixing the flaws you wallow in the sorrow that you believe in your head that comes with it. 

It’s acceptance, attitude, and change not just “being yourself”"
