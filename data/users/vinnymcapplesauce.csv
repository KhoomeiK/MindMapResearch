BUUUUT, it sounds like this isn't so much of a law, but a rule for your client.  If you dig further, you might find the real reason they are saying this is they probably have some stupid internal budgeting rule about ""if we buy from NJ businesses, we can pull the $ from XYZ budget instead of ABC budget.""  I usually find that if the client wants something bad enough, there's usually a way for them to get around their rules.

It depends on who has more leverage in the negotiation.  Who wants it bad enough?  Do you want the sale more, or do they want the software more?  I mean, you don't *have* to sell to them.

smallbusiness,feiifo8,t3_ep880k,1579139267.0,"Take it with a grain of salt, but here's my 2 cents :D

Why is your choice between C-Corp and LLC?  Why not do an S-Corp?  

Having formed and studied each of the three structures over the years, I can't find any reason to choose an LLC, ever.  Unless you want to pay more taxes and more $ to lawyers and accountants - lol.

To me, the only 2 structures ever worth considering for operating businesses are S-Corp or C-Corp. And you can easily move from S-Corp to C-Corp.  Regardless of which structure you choose for your unique situation, you should:

1. make your choice based on what makes sense for the structure of the business, and the activity the business will be engaged in, rather than the cost or amount of work organizing the structure will take, and 
2. make sure you know 100% why you chose that structure.  Study, study, study until it makes sense to you.  If needed, consult with a tax attorney (no accountants) until you grok it.

Note that I'm purposely using phrases like ""the business"" and staying away from phrases like ""your business"" because you should really think of the business as a separate thing.  It will be a separate legal entity under the law, so it might be helpful to think of it as having a life of its own with its own responsibilities that it will get people to carry out on its behalf.

>We also feel overwhelmed by the amount of legal documents that are required to file each year.

It's really not that much, and there's really no appreciable difference in filing requirements (time, effort, etc) between these structures at the small-business level.  Also, your lawyer/accountant will take care of that anyway.  Lawyers and accountants are an operational expense your business will have to cover, so plan to make your pricing such that the business can cover those (and other) operational expenses.  IOW, don't worry about it too much; if it gets to be too much, it's a problem you can just throw money at. :D

>Do we still technically need to file a meeting minutes?

As to *officially filing* meeting minutes, I'm not aware of any government agency that requires you to *file* meeting minutes for private companies (someone will surely correct me if I'm wrong about some state/locality.)  I see this typically used as a scare tactic by accountants trying to push people into LLCs, or by shady fraud companies that send phony notices/bills that look like authentic government bills to newly formed companies claiming to file minutes for you to meet a requirement that doesn't even exist.  

You can hold meetings and keep minutes yourself on decisions that were made in the meetings. It's a good idea. The whole concept behind it is to make sure you and your partners/shareholders all agree on how the business is to be run.  And that you have a paper trail of documentation to refer back to when/if needed.  Your meetings can be you and your partner grabbing a beer in your garage and agreeing that there's nothing to discuss or change.  Log it in the corporate minutes book, and boom, done.  Early on, it will be a log of decisions like which bank to use, which lawyer/accountant to use, etc.

>Also, should we incorporate in Delaware or in Texas where we will  operate our business from.

If you're going to be operating in Texas, why would you incorporate in Delaware?  Not being rhetorical; I'm genuinely asking you that question.  Your situation is unique to you.  Again, just make sure you 100% know why you would do something like that.  

My personal current thinking (open to change with new perspectives) is: the only reason I would incorporate in Delaware is if I were going to immediately register patents/IP, and/or seek funding from VC sources.  If I'm starting the business because I want to start operations and generate revenue first, then I'm less concerned about appeasing VC. I also don't know any VC that would *not* invest in a good deal simply because of lack of Delaware incorporation.  Besides, if you incorporate in TX, then get VC funding dependent on DE incorporation, you could always just incorporate in DE later, move assets, and shut down the TX corp.

If you DID incorporate in Delaware, you would ""register"" the corporation with Texas as a ""foreign"" corporation.  You would be liable for taxes in both states.  If someone sues you, you *might* have to travel to Delaware for court.

>And if we incorporate in Delaware, do we have  to get a business license in Texas to operate out of Texas?

Yes. Most, if not all, local or state governments will require business licenses in the locality in which you exist and operate.  So, plan to register and get licensed to do business in any locality you will be doing business in.  See ""business nexus"" for more info on that concept, and refer to local city/county government websites for info in specific localities you'll be in.

In my experience, the less information you give these types of people/companies, the better.  Most of these details you gave are none of their business and may even violate any NDAs you may have signed with your client (YMMV.)  

If I were you, I'd wait until the 1099 comes in, since that's all you have that will meet their requirements.  If your potential employer starts asking questions, tell them that the screening company is causing the hold-up.  The more you can make it sound like they're being ridiculous because of this one little thing, the more likely the hiring manager is to override it.
