socialanxiety,fdisjlj,t1_fd8i02y,1578450081.0,I’m always worried about one to one chat since I’m scared I might offend others too or might be talking too much about myself. It sucks when they stop replying. Your only answer is through this person that might not reply fast for your emergency answer. That’s why I just post on community to get ppl’s opinions which means whoever is online will comment within mins. So you feel better to get answers rather than having to wait for days for a reply.

So I now try avoid individual chat or group chat , just post onto community about something and let anyone comment what they think about it is what I’ve been comfortable with now. Since one to one is only getting 1 person’s opinion. I want is everyone  opinion. Sometimes I don’t know what I did is the right thing. If  chat to someone 1 to 1 it’s sometimes going to be “no” because it’s only their opinion. And I get upset and started to think everyone thinks the same and will say no, which is a bad idea, so I recommend asking a community so you can get different people opinions so it all mix rather than one that backfired you."
