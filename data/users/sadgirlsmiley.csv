socialanxiety,fdisjlj,t1_fd8i02y,1578450081.0,I’m always worried about one to one chat since I’m scared I might offend others too or might be talking too much about myself. It sucks when they stop replying. Your only answer is through this person that might not reply fast for your emergency answer. That’s why I just post on community to get ppl’s opinions which means whoever is online will comment within mins. So you feel better to get answers rather than having to wait for days for a reply.

socialanxiety,fd68kdf,t3_ek2ub8,1578187147.0,"I used to, but hardly now since some ppl get off topic, stopped replying, made me feel bad for not watching the show their watching when I have my own taste and opinion. So I now try avoid individual chat or group chat , just post onto community about something and let anyone comment what they think about it is what I’ve been comfortable with now. Since one to one is only getting 1 person’s opinion. I want is everyone  opinion. Sometimes I don’t know what I did is the right thing. If  chat to someone 1 to 1 it’s sometimes going to be “no” because it’s only their opinion. And I get upset and started to think everyone thinks the same and will say no, which is a bad idea, so I recommend asking a community so you can get different people opinions so it all mix rather than one that backfired you."
socialanxiety,fd67pw7,t3_ek2x1n,1578186753.0,"I knew it when I started having it right after being bullied in class in 2012 but didn’t knew the term for it until 2016, during the time in school I luckily was in a different class the next year in 2013, and have the same nice classmates from 2013-2015, I miss them so much that I keep having dreams of being in class or school outing with my classmates. I went to school Counselling at the time to help with my social anxiety. But it came back once I graduated."

I listen to anime songs most of the time because my phone is filled with them(I don’t do that anymore).  2.  80’s songs, I don’t listen to a lot but Some 80’s anime songs, also I like the sound from the 80’s piano that is in every 80’s music, there is something about that , that absorbs me"
