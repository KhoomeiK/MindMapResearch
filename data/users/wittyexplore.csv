The feeling of absolute dread when the phone rings. Not being able to fall asleep or get out of bed on time. Feeling trapped is the worst feeling in the world. 

You’ve got all the plates spinning on sticks right now. You will have to see if you can one by one hand these off to others or if you need to just be done for awhile. Either way, you’ll be ok. 
You are at a point where your life HAS TO CHANGE. You need to talk to your boss. If he isn’t a good boss, then you’ll have to leave. Maybe that means temp work for awhile like someone mentioned before. Shit, I kinda like that idea myself right now. :). Yes, you’ll have to take a hit financially. That sucks, but it’s workable. Stuff is just stuff. If you have to sell some of it to give yourself room to breathe, sell it!  You said that all your spare money is going into savings. That’s good. Use some of it. 

Bottom line is you are worthy of feeling good. That lesson has been a hard one to learn for me. 

Maybe the above is all you need right now. Maybe this will help, too. These are the major things I’ve changed. 
First, I stopped being available 24/7. I let most calls go to VM. Listen, then decide if it’s something I need to address right away. This is all the time, even during the work day. I only have one brain. It can really only do one thing at a time. Calls, texts and emails are distractions. So I finish what I’m doing, then listen, then decide when I’m going to take action. 
Second, I started to exercise and do yoga regularly. Absolutely essential. Endorphins make life workable. For me I had to make friends that also exercise. The random, let’s go to the gym calls I get keep me from slumping. 
Third, I got rid of toxic customers. I had too many clients at that point and several I didn’t like working for. I did a test. I thought of getting a phone call from each client. If I got that stressed feeling in my gut, I dropped them. Some didn’t pay on time or argued about the bill. Some called me in then argued with me about what should be done. One guy was just terrible to his secretary. Like really abusive so I dropped him because it made me so uncomfortable. I dropped the client that was 40% of my income at that point. My income took a huge hit initially, but I found I had room for better clients and it just worked out. You may not be able to do that exactly, but drawing a line in the sand on some things you just can’t handle anymore is the key. This far. No further. 

Best of luck! I’ve been there and it sucks. It will get better."

For me very situational. I do well in places with deeper, more thoughtful people. The Meetup app has been really good for that. Bars and especially clubs send my panic to the moon. Too loud. Too superficial. Too crowded."

socialanxiety,fdpd6zn,t3_emigtt,1578625653.0,"Been there. Many many get togethers with friends, I’d go late. I’d not go at all. I hid the social anxiety. I’d make excuses about having to work or being sick. So many times the difference between me getting out the door or not would be something small like my neighbors being in the yard. If they were there I just felt too awkward to go outside. I felt like I would be insulting to them because I wouldn’t say hi right. And fear I’d walk funny down the sidewalk. It felt like all eyes would be on me. 
It’s taken years of therapy, but I’m much much better. I have trouble days, for sure but not like it was. 
Whether you go or not, be good to yourself. As good as you can be anyway. Good luck!"
relationships,fdct7s2,t3_ekmt37,1578283639.0,"I’ve done it too. Twice in my life. Bad friends. Super critical people that I just couldn’t be around anymore. I have several really good sets of friends now. Each support me in different circumstances. Join groups that do activities you enjoy. Meetup is good for that. Stay active. Be prepared to work on developing new friendships, which can be hard to do, but is worth it. Trust your gut. Good luck!"
