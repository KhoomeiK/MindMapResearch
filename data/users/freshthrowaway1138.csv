Futurology,ffyqcep,t1_ffygkes,1580352563.0,"Building a hyperloop in America is hardly a financially wise move. The distances are massive and the starting and stopping points will be quite small. Unless you plan on using emminent domain to get ahold of the land, that cost alone would sink the idea.. Especially if you are going to ignore short and medium distance service providers like rail that will actually take people to where they are going. 

This is in addition to the cultural problem of getting Americans out of their cars."

Carbon tax and gas taxes would be an excellent place to start.  Heck, the fed gas tax rate hasn't been raised in decades and doesn't even come close to covering the costs incurred."

IsaacArthur,feud1ft,t3_eqgtku,1579385371.0,"I enjoy the idea of colonizing Venus,  but I don't see us  realistically having individuals walking on the surface in independent suits.  My view is of surface or slightly floating habitat with umbilicals to a telepresence suit.  We can currently build electronics that can handle the heat, so why try putting a human inside?

Between their failure to expand Medicare/aid, their policies to make it more difficult to get disability and assistance, their loosening of pollution standards, and their climate change denialism- the GOP deserves to be vilified for the harm and deaths they cause. If you don't know that these policies actually kill people then you should be the one to shut the fuck up."

Don't be swayed by the idea being put forth by certain groups that there was some ""Golden Age"" to which we should return. That's just overly simplistic malarkey. We aren't perfect,  but we are getting better."

Absolutely not.  Affordable housing could have helped this homeless veteran, but that would cost money and  the Fl public/republicans would rather see dead vets than pay more in taxes. Or they could take away so much of the bureaucratic nightmare that is  involved in getting accepted into aid programs, but the public would rather see dead homeless vets than have a single ""undeserving person"" get help.
