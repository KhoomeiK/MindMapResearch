Not that I disagree about Robert Durst. But to say a prosecutor isn’t allowed to claim you’re guilty in a court case is looney. It’s also very useful to keep in mind, the Senate is not a court of law, nor does impeachment require breaking the law. Their base is such shit for brains they can just make shit up. She literally wrote a fucking book claiming someone was guilty who is not convicted of said crime.

The only thing that would change is the insurance industry that’s scamming us on a daily basis would go away.

And yes, I realize it’s not ‘government run’ healthcare, and even the plan I have leaves room for desire. Regardless of how good the health coverage is, for instance, I still have horrible dental insurance. I don’t get why people even want this incurred as an expense rather than a tax. If it were payed for by taxes it would be much cheaper and you’d never have to worry about an operation or medicine or some type of dental work coming out of your pocket.

I’ll give you a while to deal with your cognitive dissonance before you start defending the Iraq war because Saddam ‘was a bad guy’ and that makes things magically okay now. Also realize before you try to argue that - one of the main things Trumpers used to defend Trump on is he’s against interventionist wars. But I guess that was yesterday before he told you to feel different now.
RussiaLago,fdgzp8i,t1_fdgv22u,1578412193.0,Ahhh yes. The old straw man of bullshit approach. Simple question. Do you have to have supported Saddam Hussein to have opposed the Iraq war?

I also notice you completely glossed over the fact that I mentioned a court case, and started acting like because they took a picture once (which is also bullshit, they were close friends for years and that’s well known) that that was my argument.

But sure. He’s the only innocent one because he’s literally divine and can’t do anything wrong... that about correct?
