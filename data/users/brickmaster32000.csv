If they did many would realize the fault but you really shouldn't be surprised that the human brain, an organ specialized in coming to snap conclusions, based on limited information and a limited energy budget, sometimes makes an ass out of itself. From what OP has said it doesn't sound like they are trying to confront OP or blame them and are just trying to figure out the discrepancy in their understanding."
TwoXChromosomes,fffd7di,t1_ffdtbjw,1579881377.0,"Is it really that surprising? There is a lot of rhetoric about how one of the reasons rape is wrong is that it makes the victim impure. It is fucked up but it is likely something most people have heard in different forms throughout their lives. Couple that with the fact that many people simply haven't sat down to think about this particular distinction unless it happened to them and you can see why their initial reaction might be confusion.

If they persist on insisting there is no difference they are certainly an asshole but I don't think it is that unusual of a first response even from people who, when they give it some thought, will ultimately be supportive."

My only question was about how closely the power generation could be kept at its ideal rated conditions, as that was relevant to the point I had made earlier. /u/saywherefore answered that for me. I have asked nothing from you, you simply have merely insisted on trying to knit pick about what you think I mean regardless of what I have actually said.

I fully understand that if the voltage generated increases that all attached load will consume incrementally more power. Those loads however are all meant to operate at the normal voltage. The extra power does nothing useful for most of the loads, therefore it is wasted. Yes, the power gets used but not in a meaningful fashion, it is excess power compared to what is needed. It is power that could go towards additional loads instead of making the existing loads dissipate slightly more power."

I agree with this completely, my contention is over whether a given load, or in this case aggregate of loads, actually does slow the generator a sufficient amount to be worth compensating for."
askscience,ff3kwy3,t1_ff3j3nx,1579543234.0,"I feel like that last sentence captures my point well though. What makes more sense, changing the habits of 27.6 million households or the entire government of the UK finding a way to gather the funds to build solar arrays for 0.005% of households?"

Now granted if the residential portion dropped off the grid entirely it would make a pretty sizable impact but chasing down extra watts of wastage used by a residential customer does not.

 It certainly does not hurt and if it makes you feel good you should do it but you should not believe that it is going to produce the meaningful changes that you are likely hoping for. For that you need to focus elsewhere on things that have much larger impacts."
askscience,ff3fkak,t1_ff3ebbr,1579540036.0,Sure but how precise is the mechanism? Maybe I simply am underestimating the machinery but I find it hard to believe that the turbine speed is controlled accurately enough to adjust for the difference of a few watts when the output is meant to be in the megawatts.

This sounds like you need to qualify what situation you are talking about because every time I looked it up it, sources would point to only needing 10's of milliamps across the heart to stop it."
askscience,ff3c737,t1_ff37zfh,1579538270.0,Not really because power generation also scales up with population. Our grid also isn't very smart and has very little storage built in. This means the power companies need to generate the power that might be used not just what vis used. So regardless of whether you keep your charger plugged in or not they will still be generating the same power whether you use it or not.
