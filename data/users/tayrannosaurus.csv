bulletjournal,fektsfj,t1_fekt07c,1579207446.0,"I saw them in SF in August, too. Definitely my favorite band. I'd love to hear Sense live! Although they did play ""Let Me Mend the Past"" & ""Work This Time"" so I can't complain. I love all their side projects as well. Already planning to see them three more times this year... lol"
bulletjournal,fekspxh,t1_fekqm9q,1579206812.0,"I totally agree, Lonerism & InnerSpeaker can't be beat... Currents was just an easy one to draw.  I've also had a King Gizzard theme for ""Augizzt."" Animal Collective is another one of my favs, that'd make a pretty dope spread :)"

bulletjournal,fegeqkj,t3_ep09rr,1579090221.0,"I do a simple spread and leave room to come back & do artsy things later. If it's a busy week, maybe I'll just add a sticker or some washi tape. If it's a short week, I'll use my downtime to doodle and make it look nice. Sometimes I leave room and never come back to it. Whatever works for you"
ems,fe49xt2,t3_enkrqz,1578857185.0,"When I was an ER tech we had a frequent flyer that had major psych issues. For whatever reason, he was not on a hold this time around. He asked to go to the bathroom, when he came back he told us the toilet was clogged. About an hour later, the housekeeper comes up to us and says, ""Well, I unclogged the toilet. You'll never guess what was in there."" I'm thinking drugs? 
Nope. A fucking crow. A whole ass bird lodged deep into the toilet. We went back to ask him WTF, and found out he eloped.

I still have many questions, not that many answers."
