Show this to politicians who denied it. Then show them a realistic simulation of their homes being flooded in real time. When they asked if it's real, denied it and say ""Your home is being flooded as we speak, but I denied it just like you denied global warming. How do you feel?"""
UnethicalLifeProTips,fef8ghe,t3_eopzkm,1579050657.0,"I looked up your error and it's a hard drive issue. Sometimes hard drives get corrupted for random reasons, but mostly due to downloading malware. What you want to do is back up all your important files to a USB stick. Just make sure you don't copy malware into that USB or the new one will have the same problem. Then get yourself a new ssd and install a new version of windows on it. 

If you want to replicate the issue, google ""put my computer into a reboot"", but this is not hard for any pc repair guy to fix, so you're gonna waste your time and more money. Since you know what the problem is, just tell them to replace your entire hard drive with a new one with Windows 10 installed. It's gonna cost a lot less if you do it yourself. Youtube is your friend."

The US not only has to take care of its citizen, but citizen of many other countries. In exchange for protection, resources, and trade benefits, the US sends troops to protect other countries and its allies. If your country is neighboring a hostile country, you would understand the need for military spending. And if you don't have the money, people or technology, you would hire or ally with a country with the best military in the world. In the US, freedom is paid for with taxes. Nothing is truly free.

videos,fe72p14,t1_fe5gcqm,1578909136.0,"I agree with you that having a healthy and educated country is great, but free colleges and healthcare would not work. 

You can see it at the lower level, public schools vs private schools are vastly different in terms of quality education. If apply to colleges, the quality would go down drastically and it would just be a waste of money. Not enough teachers for such a large number of students and not enough funding to run the massive campus or at least it would be used very ineffectively because ""free money"". People tend to waste money that's not theirs. When you offer free education, there  tends to be people that just want to play around and distract those who want to learn, just like in public schools. cause if they get expelled, they'll just go to another free college.

If you give free healthcare, doctors are going to be burnt out. It's all about supply and demand. You will have people coming in for all kinds of low level treatments and that takes time over the important ones that really need the help. If you live in the south where poverty is high, you'll understand that poor people loves to take advantage of medicaid and a lot of health professionals hate that."

In the beginning of every video, they could mention to click that link if people want to leave a comment. When people visit that link, they do a one time sign up and sign in to comment. There would be the respected youtube video embed on that page so they can watch it from that site if they want. It takes a bit of work, but its easier than fighting Google/Youtube for change."

Say you live in a nice house in a rich neighborhood and keep to yourself, never ever bother anyone else. But then people who aren't as well off from another neighborhood keeps coming in a steal your things or hurt your family. You can spend a lot of money on security, but when that isn't enough to deter them or the police doesn't do shit, then a war is inevitable.
