Braves,fff1jvg,t1_ffbze36,1579873156.0,The Riley adjustment thing is real. As someone who followed him closely when he was coming up - there was always a month to half season for him to  get situated and then generally domination. I'm interested to see what season 2 brings in the show.

MurderedByWords,fes1goz,t1_fery4f4,1579360462.0,"This is all correct. The Vulgate is almost as much garbage as the King James was, but the King James was almost intentionally garbage because the translation process was heavily politically motivated. 

Some small parts of the New Testament have some of the oldest manuscripts in Aramaic, but these were still almost certainly later copies from the original Koine A Greek. 

The OT is all Ancient or Biblical Hebrew and I've never heard it called anything else. 

The irony of saying the OT is in Aramaic is that Aramaic was the spoken language of Israel at the time and most Jews could not actually read Ancient Hebrew, so a couple hundred years before Christ the Jewish religious leaders had the OT translated into Greek which was called the Septuagint"

anime,fd50x8o,t1_fd448sn,1578173093.0,"I'll talk to this since I had until recently only ever watched the original season, but powered through everything up to new season. 

The fights are still awesome and gorgeous to boot. The Alicization story feels like a complete departure from the original story, but again you have an Isekai series where the MC is playing different 'games' which i find really interesting.  I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed the new stuff when i was pushing through it, though it starts very slow in Alicization."

madlads,fc152jf,t1_fc13ci4,1577308483.0,"I have managed people for 15 years and I have never called a reference and never actually been called for a reference. They are a waste of time. Paid background checks cover everything you need from a reference, and no same person is going to put a reference on their resumé that isn't going to give them a glowing review. On top of the fact you can't actually say anything about the former employee other than whether or not they worked there."
