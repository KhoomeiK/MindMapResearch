religion,ff2fhok,t1_ff2cysp,1579503936.0,"Ugh.  No, lol.  He's making things up.  If an instrumental score is playing in the background of a love scene, the music doesn't become tainted by sin.  Music is music.  The bible itself has a book devoted to a couple making love, called the song of Solomon.   If there is an entire book devoted to words written in a sexual way, that clearly doesn't make the bible sinful.  The bible says sex is a gift from God.  The song of Solomon celebrates that gift.    It's the ultimate communication between two people.  It shouldn't be polluted with shame and guilt and never used to hurt another.  It should be held sacred  and shared with the one you love.  The idea that music is made sin by being associated with a sexual scene not only insults the music  but pollutes the act of intimacy with shame, instead of celebrating love.

Anyway...

Critical thinking is really important here; if the message in a song tells you to do something bad, or to treat people horribly,  then it's not a song you want to listen to.  

While I'm no longer a Christian,  I come from a family full of clergy.  I think they would agree with me saying if something causes you to do something wrong, it's not something you want in your life."
religion,ff2ch4z,t3_er6p1i,1579500657.0,"I grew up in a fundamentalist Baptist church during the 80s and 90s.   Right smack in the middle of the satanic panic.   I got the same message.  And it's bullshit.   

When I was a Christian I listened to 'secular' music that filled my soul with joy.  Sometimes I had to hide albums in my mattress at home, but it was worth it until I could move out.  There are some amazing songs out there filled with stories about adventures,  the human experience,  love, and sorrow.  

Also, according to your Sunday school teacher, classical music is sinful unless it's liturgical music.  No more ""Blue Danube"", ""Ein Kelin Nachtmusic"", and "" ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"".

Pity your Sunday school teacher, and ignore this foolish lesson.  Then go explore all the sounds you can find.

Edit: words, and autocorrect is a harsh mistress"

depression,fek3mtu,t1_fek0thq,1579191907.0,"I understand,  but I don't have to preface my comment with my life history in this post. I did when you told me you were this way your entire life and assumed that for me I was just going through a rough patch.   In this way you reversed what you accuse others of.  You're sick of people ""cheapening the condition"" (which I have seen and had to deal with because it makes my life harder), while underestimating what another person is going through.  That's just as bad.

It's not my responsibility in this case to control whether or not you feel I abuse the term.  And I would absolutely never underestimate what a person is feeling; I would leave any sort of diagnosis to a professional, especially a stranger.

What i  had to learn in therapy is that people will always abuse terms, but until they give evidence that they are, it is best to remain neutral until/ unless more info is given.  Even better  adopt the motto ""not my circus,  not my monkeys"", and leave their issues with a professional.  Assumptions without evidence are trouble  and I am respible for my feelings and thoughts unless the other party has played an active role in causing those feelings (namecalling, hurtful behavior, etc.).

I need to stop responding.   So far I've been told I'm not authentic (thanks fornthe apology), that I'm suppose to outline my life story to justify my illness to a stranger (I don't), and that I'm responsible for assumptions on my life when I offer a snapshot of a week of it (I'm not).  That was done without malice, but it's still hurtful.

Please remember you are not owed explanations for a stranger's life on social media when they say that your comment was helpful in trying to make sense of a relapse of depression.  Just say you're welcome.  I understand where you are coming from but I can no longer put energy I don't have into this conversation, and will no longer reply.  I'm not trying to be mean, but I am trying to be as clear as possible with my boundaries and why I've just set them.

And I truly wish the best for you and your condition as well.   If you want to learn what I did, look up dialectical behavioral therapy.   It's all online.   I always recommend it to people in case they need it or know someone that could benefit from it.  It's changed life.   Take care, and I truly wish the best for you in 2020!"
depression,fejzudd,t1_fejvops,1579189577.0,"I have ptsd which includes general anxiety and rapid cycling bipolar (type 2), with self harming behavior that I fight daily.   I've been dealing with depression since I was 15, so for about 25 years.  I've done 15 years of therapy (inpatient for suicide, and out patient), having just finished 4 months of a ""tune up"" outpatient at a clinic after a horrible relapse last June.  It's bad enough I can't hold down a regular job and have to stay on disability.   The work I do is freelance art to make ends meet, because anything else causes a relapse,  this latest one I've been dealing  with for the last week.  I know this is depression because most things in life are fine, but I've been fighting the urge to cut my arms open, and I have no will or feeling to do anything important.   The only way I've been getting through it is by going on autopilot and forcing myself to get things done so I don't lose clients (the opposite action skill I learned in my year of weekly DBT outpatient sessions).

Depression comes in cycles.  The past week has been one instance in countless instances over the past 25 years.   It's thanks to hard self work, therapy, meditation (which took 15 years to find the ones that work), and a good support system that they only last a week instead of months or half a year like they used to.  

You're not wrong in your post that some people don't have depression but bad patches, but maybe next time say you're welcome instead of assuming someone's situation,  and gatekeeping depression.  Hope you pull out of your cycle soon."

religion,fdqhhh5,t1_fdqfo6m,1578666786.0,"I grew up Evangelical Christian but left as an adult.   In that denomination I was always told they weren't really true Christian, because they were catholic and not protestant.

I was told the same line about Mormons, Lutherans, Anglicans, even Presbyterians (who are protestant but not evangelical).

So all my Christian friends in school were not really christian...because they weren't following the right branch.  And that never made sense to me.  Even after all the explanations and excuses.  Because those same ""reasons"" could be applied to evangelicals from other denominations.  

It's tribalism.  And this can be found in a lot of religions with different denominations.  Not all denominations have this hard line and accept different types of christianity as being Christian.   Sadly,  if I went back to being a Christian I suspect my family wouldn't see me as a true Christian because I wouldn't be evangelical.   

Sometimes the best way to deal with this is to apply the Fruits of the Spirit from Galatians in the New Testament:

""22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.""
