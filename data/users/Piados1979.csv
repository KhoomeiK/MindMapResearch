AskEurope,ff5qou1,t1_ff5p7es,1579606384.0,"If the majority of our society is okay with her to be chancellor, i don't know why there should be term limits. The chancellor is not a president like in the USA or Russia with much more power then a our chancellor.

There are elections every four years where you vote for the party to become government. This party or a coalition of partys position a candidate for chancellor who will be voted by the parliament.

I hope it's understandable. I don't often discuss this using the english language and I'm not really certain that everything is correct. 

In short: I'm fine without term limits as long as the election is a demoratic one."
AskEurope,ff4cxg2,t1_ff43ee5,1579560661.0,"After all those years, I'm totally okay with her, though she isn't part of the party I would elect. 

Helmut Kohl didn't get my sympathie ever. And he was chancellor for 16 years as well."
AskEurope,ff2elw0,t3_er3ej2,1579502940.0,"When I was 14 I went hiking with a boy-scout group in denmark. One afternoon an old guy with a caravan stopped us to ask for the way. He was dutch and we talked the entire time in broken english until he finally asked where we're from. 
We answered that we're from germany and he said:"" Ach, dann können wir uns auch auf deutsch unterhalten."" (Ah, so we can speak german then).
Man, about half an hour we tried to explain we were not from denmark. Mostly with hands and feet because we weren't able to speak english very well with our english skills at that time.

Edit: In reality it was only a 10 minutes talk but in my memory it took at least half an hour. It was 1994."

I'm just concerned that China doesn't give enough information about what really happens, so everything could get worse than it already is."

OSHA,fen6pbs,t1_fen4kwb,1579278171.0,"Probably same here. Noone remembers how to perform first-aid though everyone has to do first-aid lessons to get a drivers licence. 
At my workplace there is a yearly first-aid class everyone should visit at least every second year. But there are mostly the same few employees everytime."

ADR are placed in many puplic places and of course they aren't locked because in case of an emergency every second counts."
MINI,fem8w07,t3_epv4rp,1579244060.0,"When I was about to buy our F55 6 months ago my whole family argued with me and said ""a Mini is not a car, it'll break instantly, buy a VW or Skoda or sth like that!"" I was so angry because I always wanted a Mini and read of all the issues you might have with it and what to keep in mind, but I told them I 
consider it.

Bought the Mini almost instantly and I'm so in love with it. Of all cars I have ever driven this is the most fun. Til now, no problems at all."
