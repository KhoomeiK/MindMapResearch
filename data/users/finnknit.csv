My son is a trans boy, and has generally had positive experiences with his classmates and teachers. Occasionally, a teacher has collectively referred to a group that included him as ""girls"", but apologized when he pointed out that he's not a girl.

One of my coworkers is a trans woman. Everyone at work treats her with respect. She's been at the company since before she transitioned, and people who knew her before have been supportive.

One interesting thing about the Finnish language is that it doesn't have gendered pronouns. There's only one third-person pronoun for everyone, so the language is already gender-neutral."

Depending how long it takes for the permission to be granted, it could create a significant delay in finalizing a sale to a non-citizen. In areas with a lot of competition between buyers, sellers might decide that they would rather sell to a citizen so that the sale can be completed quicker. Citizenship could become the deciding factor in who the sellers decide to sell to, which creates a disadvantage for non-citizens.

The law also applies to joint real estate purchases in which one of the buyers is a citizen and the other is not. So, for example, if my American husband and I want to buy property jointly, we'd have to apply for and get permission even thought I'm a Finnish citizen. The alternative would be to buy the property in my name only, but that creates a disadvantage when applying for a loan, because only my income would be considered for negotiating the terms of the loan."

TransyTalk,ffbco3r,t1_ffazoy4,1579759801.0,"The calculator is a good starting point, but there is definitely some experimentation needed to find the ideal size and style for an individual. 

A lot of fit issues are often shape issues rather than size issues. For example, not filling a cup doesn't necessarily mean that the cup is too big. It can mean that the shape of the cup is not the right shape for the wearer's breasts. Breasts that are wide-set and less projected need a different cup shape than breasts that are close-set and more projected. A lot of people think that different bra styles are just a matter of fashion taste, but different styles fit different shapes better.

Figuring out an individual's shape is equally important as figuring out their size, but it can be difficult. The shape guide in the sidebar on desktop and in the community info on mobile has a lot of good resources. Style recommendations from others who have a similar shape can also be very helpful. But often, it comes down to trying on a lot of bras and seeing what works and what doesn't."

I ordered the veggie burger of the month, and when I got it, it had bacon on it just like the meat versions, even though the ingredient list on the menu didn't include bacon. I took it back, and the manager realized that the kitchen had been making them that way since the start of them month. 

When the kitchen staff was trained to make the new burgers, they had correctly been told that the veggie version was not vegan (it had cheese and egg-based mayo). They misunderstood this to mean that the version with the veggie patty wasn't supposed to be vegetarian at all and put bacon on it like the other burgers.

So you dropped off your coat and anything else that you didn't need during the day, then got it out of your locker at the end of the school day. Overall, my high school was run pretty well. My middle school was frustratingly stupid, though."

It doesn't help that the sentence starts with the object rather than the subject, giving it a Yoda-like feel.

Using more modern sentence structure, it would be ""We prize our liberties and we will maintain our rights."""

Naked mixed-gender sauna with your close friends is starting to become more normal. But when I went to Germany, there was naked mixed-gender sauna with strangers, and that was a little unusual for me."

It's just me and all the little noises, lights, shadows, itches, and tension in muscles I didn't even know I had. 

I sleep with earplugs and an eye mask to reduce the sensory input, but I'm still stuck with the things I can feel, like the pressure of my body on the mattress, and the temperature in the room."

If I remember correctly, you could manually tell it to start a new cycle regardless of whether there was bleeding. You can also add your own notes about medication, so it can help track symptoms in relation to HRT."
vegetarian,fdjbfc8,t1_fdhz3y0,1578464187.0,"Some people actually say things along the lines of ""If you're not eating a fully vegan diet, why bother? You might as well go back to eating meat."" And if they happen to say it to someone who is taking the first steps toward reducing meat consumption, or toward a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, that person might take their advice and give up. 

Change is hard, and it usually doesn't happen all at once. Being told that the changes you've made so far aren't good enough doesn't help."
