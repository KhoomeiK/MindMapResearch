As the partner of an ecologist there's a way of quantifying large groups that's quite good for estimating.

Take a sample group of a rough size and number then divide it by the total group size.

For example, see a flock of birds? Look for 10 in the group and estimate the rest based on that.

I'm not saying this is 100% accurate but it's a method to use when estimating the numbers of people in a march."
