I don't think you're overthinking it, but you do need to carefully weigh how badly you want to be tied down. Stability is (relatively) important to dogs. I made the mistake of taking the Christmas tree down while my dog was sleeping in my room, and she responded by growling and searching for the thief who stole the tree.

I don't know you, but it also doesn't sound like your clinically depressed - more like, you have a deep sadness from a lonely lifestyle. A dog will definitely ease your loneliness. If you find that the sadness continues despite easing the loneliness, you may want to engage a therapist.

I don't know what costs are like in Romania, but I spend on average \~$250/mo on my pupper. Heartworm/flee+tick prevention medication, bimonthly grooming (short, fine hair = low grooming requirements), and quality dog food. I have enough saved up/liquid in case of a single emergency.

Ecosystems are a lot more fragile than the rock they are built on top of, and while each action of ours seems like nothing - take a twig here, a set of antlers there - cumulatively and over time, it adds up to a major imbalance in the ecosystem.

You can also think of an ecosystem as a relatively closed system. It's in equilibrium - very little leaves the ecosystem, and very little is added to it. When you add or remove something from that relatively closed system, you disrupt that equilibrium. Disrupt the equilibrium enough, and you destroy the ecosystem.

If you aren't willing to abide by the leave no trace philosophy - OK. But stay out of national/state parks and wilderness preserves. Hike in municipal parks instead.

TL;DR, this is an Stgw 57 - a Swiss battle rifle in 7.5mm Swiss. They're frequently used in the competition scene in Switzerland. The wonky trigger is, as someone mentioned, the 'winter trigger' of the Stgw 57, intended to allow a soldier to operate it even with very thick gloves.

You may notice that this trigger is quite a bit longer than the standard trigger. This is very relevant to a competition shooter - it changes the feel of the trigger. For this particular shooter, it allows him a better feel for when the sear is going to break, which he prefers, and it gives a lighter trigger pull as well. So...he bolted on a spacer between the pistol grip and the receiver to make it more comfortable to use the winter trigger for normal operation.

It's ugly, but competition is always function over form. These things shoot 1.5-2 MOA *bone fucking stock*. I would imagine it wouldn't take much work to make one a sub-MOA gun.

Edit: Also, you don't see these in the USA because of import restrictions -\_-"

> ""I set our attendance standard by this man,"" says Todd Wilson, plant  manager at Schain Mold & Engineering. ""I say, if this man can get  here, walking all those miles through snow and rain, well I'll tell you,  I have people in Pontiac 10 minutes away and they say they can't get  here — bull!"" 

Dude's more likely than not making six figures, driving to work every morning and driving home every evening, while telling his employees that if they aren't willing to walk 21 miles/day just to *get to work*, they are insufficiently dedicated to the job.

ITCareerQuestions,fdtv1jq,t3_en1zsb,1578722681.0,"That's a 52% raise. Your absolute worst case is you stick it out for a year and use your new salary as leverage for your next job. Your best case is the job is even better than what you have now.

I can't speak for everyone, but I had a similar pay jump from my help desk job to my current one. When that happened, it coincided with a significantly better working environment, better coworkers, and a better culture of communication and respect in the wider IT dept.

As for your question - I evaluate my job based on 1.) my current compensation vs. my desired compensation, 2.) whether my employer is helping me expand my skillset, and 3.) how I feel about coming into work. So...if I feel good about coming into work and my employer is developing my skills, I can overlook a 20k gap in current vs desired pay.

Only you can decide what's right for you, though."

Reason being - Windows will convert the two drives to dynamic drives, and then add them to each other as one logical volume. Big downside: Only Windows will be able to recognize those partitions down the line. Not sure what happens if one drive fails."

The weight doesn't bother me at all. I think it's because it's not especially far forward on the gun - I do a lot of offhand, so I'm pretty sensitive to weight distribution. Also, the barrel is really light (24 oz) - it's actually lighter than my buddy's rifle with a red dot as a result."

I've got about $400 to get it into an ideal condition for a comp gun. Small brake, Geiselle trigger, rail covers (pencil barrel gets hot quick), folding BUIS, and one of those funny devices for screwing the lower and upper together. Eventually, when I hit the 8k round range, I'm gonna rebarrel it with an 18"" or 20"" carbon fiber barrel and stop shooting steel-cased ammo.

You can build a rock solid PSA for a lot less. Just make sure you double check everything as you go - PSA's QC is OK, but sometimes out of spec receivers make it to the customer."

The Strike Eagle was a Christmas gift from my father. It's not great glass by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd imagine it beats shooting with irons. We'll find out when I get it out to the range.

I have about 1500 rounds through this rifle so far and it's functioned flawlessly. On a good day, it gave me 3"" groups with irons - looking forward to seeing how it does with an optic."
guns,fdpgh2o,t1_fdpgcdw,1578627996.0,What stock is that? Rifle length buffer with adjustable LOP?
liberalgunowners,fdpg613,t1_fdpf3fr,1578627769.0,"Thanks! I appreciate the kind words. The 16"" barrel + fixed stock makes for a very well balanced, soft-shooting gun. I find most ARs to be front-heavy, which is not my preference.

The trade-off is I have an excessive amount of muzzle climb relative to the amount of perceived recoil (zero). I plan to fix that problem with a small brake soon. At some point I also plan to replace the barrel with a Criterion 18"" barrel, which will help keep the muzzle on target and hopefully further improve accuracy."
guns,fdpfwb8,t1_fdpf1uq,1578627570.0,"That's entirely up to you. There are not right or wrong answers here - just what's appropriate for you and your circumstances. If I were single and had no kids or roommates to worry about, I would keep a long-gun and sidearm loaded in a quick access 'safe' - this is a lesson learned from the Sutherland Springs shooting.

I don't have any of my guns loaded or quickly accessible right now. The risk is simply too high with my kids and storage solution. I will eventually be at a point where I can keep a loaded handgun in a quick access safe under tight supervision, but...to say I don't want my kids to have access to my guns is an understatement. I can't imagine how I would feel if one of my kids stole a gun when they're older and kill a bunch of folk with it."
