Until this morning she didn’t know I had been in counseling for BPD and she was like “I have a spidey sense for BPD and you never seemed like you have it. Let’s whip out the dsm-5” and we went over it and I met the criterion and she was like “you mask it so well what the heck” but she disagreed with my LPC’s major depressive disorder diagnosis and the cyclothymia makes more sense so she overruled it"

WeightLossAdvice,fe66igp,t1_fe64uyg,1578882890.0,"Thank you for all this info. I’ve been taking omega 3 supplements for the past six months since I learned my triglycerides are severely elevated. I’ve never been a fan of seafood, so that’s why I take supplements. The only things I drink are water, oat milk (bc I have food allergies to milk and soy), and the occasional alcoholic drink. I definitely don’t eat enough fruits or vegetables, and barely enough meats so that’s what I’m finally incorporating in my diet. I’ve been a carb whore my whole life so I’m limiting my carbs (bread, pasta, etc.). I’m starting my exercise off slowly for a few reasons: 1. I have an unbalanced pelvis so rigorous activity becomes painful. 2. I have no endurance because I never exercise. 3. I have a history of bulimia during my teen years so when I do exercise, I tend to overdo it on purpose and begin purging to lose weight even faster. So, I’m trying to take things slow this time. I have had a DNA test through ancestry and other sites and heart health seems to be inherited through my paternal side - they almost all drop dead from clogged arteries and have almost all had open heart surgeries. I’ve been told I snore, but not severely. I think I see my doctor soon so I’ll talk to them about all of this. Thank you for everything!"
