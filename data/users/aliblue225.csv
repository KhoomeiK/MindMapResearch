AskWomenOver30,ff31s3a,t3_er6tub,1579531413.0,"Ikr?! And what is it with the single black hair that randomly grows out of your chin?!  You keep an eye out for it after plucking it just to make sure it doesn't return...and then, all of a sudden, when you've seen nothing for weeks, it appears and it's like 1/4 inch long! Lol, jeezus"

TalesFromYourServer,fevjq0i,t1_feuz7d9,1579398168.0,"Haha. One time about 100 years ago, I witnessed some guy trying to return old, used, dirty speakers at WalMart. Lady behind the desk wasn't having it and he was becoming irate and demanded to speak to the owner. She just deadpanned,  ""the owner's dead, sir."""
TalesFromYourServer,feioh7j,t1_fehuwqm,1579143310.0,"I think so too. And who wrote this?! The ruggedly handsome bartender? Ish. Also, I've probably been that person asking for the red drink because my knowledge of cocktails is crap and I never know what to ask for. I've never been treated with hostility though."
AskEurope,fe6bdof,t1_fe439n7,1578886120.0,Just wanted to say that's really interesting how the grammatical role of a word is determined by its case. I liked your dog and cat example. Who knew!

AmItheAsshole,fcjusu6,t1_fcjltob,1577705793.0,"I agree and got into that discussion below. Sorry that happened to you. I hope you're in a better place now. As a parent, I just can't believe people allow this stuff to happen to their kids."
AmItheAsshole,fchq99l,t1_fchp3ch,1577652995.0,I hear ya.
AmItheAsshole,fchopwm,t1_fchkvv7,1577652525.0,"No, that's not at all what I'm saying. I'm saying why don't men stick up for their kids in light of a step parent being unreasonable? I agreed below that it goes both ways in terms of women not protecting their kids either. 
But I guarantee you I'm not asking men why they're not controlling their women."
AmItheAsshole,fcho8n9,t1_fchn58y,1577652343.0,"No no...I meant the Dad is Gen X, not the kid."
AmItheAsshole,fchhgqv,t1_fchen23,1577650520.0,"You're absolutely right it can go both ways. I guess I've seen it more with men when the kids are older teens. I watched one boomer aged guy with 2 adult children of his own push them away from the family business and replace them with the new wife's adult children. And this is a business he and their mom had built for years and years before she died. 
But indeed, you see any cases of younger toddler aged children being seriously injured or even killed when moms leave them in the care of the new boyfriend. And you know the abuse was ongoing and she had to have known and looked the other way. I think one of the biggest risks to a small child is an unrelated male in the household. 
Myself, I have teenagers now and I can't imagine looking the other way at anyone treating them poorly. It would break my heart. 
Also, the guy here who has a 17 year old is almost certainly a gen x'er, which is what I am. I thought we were further ahead of boomers in that social aspect,  but like anything else, no blanket statement will ever work I suppose."

AmItheAsshole,fch2233,t1_fcgw9pi,1577646532.0,"Why do men allow this? I'm not asking you directly,but it seems like this happens a lot after men lose spouses. Guys! Wake up! Your 17 year old is not going to start calling your new wife ""mom."" It's ridiculous! Stand up for your kids!"
TalesFromRetail,fcc521g,t3_egprwo,1577594498.0,"Well, I guess on the plus side, he was concerned enough that he wanted to make sure you were all right.
