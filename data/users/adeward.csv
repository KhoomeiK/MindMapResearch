You are absolutely right to be suspicious of scam breeders. If the price of a puppy seems too good to be true, then it probably is a scam. Whether it's forged or promised paperwork that never turns out to be valid, or breeding without proper DNA screening, or more common intensive breeding techniques, please go to a reputable organisation like the Kennel Club to help find a breeder. And above all else - don't be afraid to ask questions, even prying ones. A breeder that isn't happy to answer all your questions openly has something to hide."

We encourage gradually expanding reach as we become older and gain more responsibility. Everyone can improve, we just start with the things we can control around us and grow.
