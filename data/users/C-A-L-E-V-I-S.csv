DestinyTheGame,felgzcl,t1_fekyp6v,1579221943.0,"D2, especially vanilla launch, REALLY seemed to lean into that stylized aesthetic, and I think it was one of the biggest issues with it, and a huge reason it came across cheap or thin. Really by no fault of the artists doing the work. Someone made that call and it never really fit Destiny at all IMO."
DestinyTheGame,felgjwv,t1_fekz0ps,1579221662.0,"Yeah, I actually think they were REALLY going for a dark feel on the moon in D2, and nailed the aspect of it in so many ways, but even parts of the moon in D2 just appear too *clean* or something. D2 just seems to be missing the grit and dirtiness that made D1 feel darker, heavier, more intimidating. D2s locations still just feel more kiddie to me, even when I’m down in the dungeon. It’s no fault of the artists though. It’s like if you had the same artist use fine pencils on a piece of artwork and asked them to remake it using spray paint. It might still be good, but just feel different. 

I would say the armor design is STILL an issue in the game that people regularly complain about, and one of the last pieces to fixing Destiny. So when i see these posts I tend to chime in cause I think it’s an issue on a deeper level than the masses tend to realize."
DestinyTheGame,felg3ea,t1_felaqmc,1579221354.0,"Yeah, I agree with this. I would say they’ve really done their best on putting tons of details into pieces and worlds especially in D2. There’s just something missing that gives D1 an aesthetically pleasing quality. D1 seems to have s big of film grain while D2 has none it seems. That could help, but everything, including sparrows just LOOKS expensive and weighty in D1."
DestinyTheGame,fektkl4,t1_fejoyr5,1579207317.0,"The issue with D2 unfortunately runs even deeper than just the sets not being as good. I do a lot of hopping back and forth between D1 and D2 and D1 is just flat out more aesthetically pleasing. HOWEVER, it’s not the artists fault. It really comes down to whatever tools they’re using to build D2 just aren’t as aesthetically pleasing as D1. D1’s gear, enemies, and worlds have an underlying weight and smoothness to the way they look. Somehow a game that came out 5 (?) years ago looks more real than D2. Sucks cause so much of D2 SHOULD look amazing, but doesn’t because of whatever new tools they are using. Just my opinion btw."

Load in, fly to tower, grab Banshee and Vanguard bounties, line up my loadout to whatever they want me to use (leaving out fun exotics due to champions, weapon requirements, etc) load in and run a few NFS to finish bounties, log out. Some fun to be had, but the game is way too limiting with the mod system and requirements IMO."

IMO it was only really received well in general because it REALLY brought back the pointless grind to the game. It just made it so you COULD play longer.

They’re in a hard place though, because on some level people asked for years for a game that they could play EVERY day for HOURS and NEVER run out of things to do even in “content droughts”. That is an in possible request though, and one that ultimately I don’t think is healthy to chase."
