What can we do this season to strengthen the roster and create more flexibility down the road? I think the answer is simple: trade cj for depth and assets. Baze and whiteside were never long term additions,  with those three pieces the blazers could completely revitalize the roster while keeping developing players with upside,  and have mor flexibility going forward. If cj had a smaller contract that would be a different story, but him and Dame take so much space that it's pretty hard to make improvements while retaining both.

On the other hand, let's say the team is healthy and still can't win a championship. What then? The team will be capped out big time with little options"
