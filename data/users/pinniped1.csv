GolfRival,ffdzcic,t3_et0zla,1579832700.0,"Helm is actually a good club for Stage 12.  There are a couple holes where I used it to hit tiny fairway pads.  I think that was 3 different par 5s that become easy eagles and occasional albies in favorable wind.  Just hitting Earth to the main fairway leaves you usually needing an iron or wood dunk to get the eagle.  So hitting the little fairway with Helm will give you a lot of eagle-birdie wins at least.

I'm not sure if BW3 would shape a shot correctly for them.  I didn't try it.

The one hole where the tiny fairway is 300+ yards from the tee really needs BW4 to hit reliably, except when you have a few knots on the tail.

I'd definitely take Helm to 10.  BW3 isn't really a coin question unless you're buying legendary cards in the daily deals.  If you're doing that, then yes BW would be the first legendary I'd buy."

You have to assume that the people shooting know zero about gun safety.  The fact that it's an air gun is probably worse because people won't take safety as seriously as they would if you were handing them a real gun.

I don't know much about guns, but I went to an event a few years ago that had a small range and a guy showing people how to use .22 pistols.  Even those tiny guns...the dude was super serious about safety before you got to shoot.  But with an air gun it's just here ya go, have at it..."
