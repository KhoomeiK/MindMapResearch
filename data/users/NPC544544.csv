Your delusional if you think the security guard harrasing a player after that is appropriate.

No I did not slap a nola officer, it was a Memphis officer. Sorry if you don't have any friends or have never had fun, sad indeed."

And again, it was a fucking security guard in a locker room harrasing a player.  Dumb ass should have know better.

And yes I have been to nola, no I obviously won't slap a cop on the ass, and yes, I have in fact slapped a cop on the ass.  Some people actually know how to have a little fun in our bullshit new society where everyone wants everyone else's life to be ruined for any little thing they can find."

nfl,fenu1q3,t1_fen7nrm,1579290702.0,"1, not a police office, he's literally just a security guard.

2, he absolutely 100% put himself in that situation.  He was stationed outside the door.  A reporter claimed that there was a trashcan fire and called him in. A napkin was smoldering and required the brave action of pouring some water over it.  He then went on to harrass players.

3, again, security guard not police office, if his soft ass wants to feel violated that's fine, he can go cry on a couch about the horrible ordeal, involving the police is stupid and uncalled for.  People supporting that idiotic situation are 100% advocating for more and continued police harassment on citizens.  That should not be supportive because some people can't handle having their ass slapped."
