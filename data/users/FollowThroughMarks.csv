CODZombies,feturer,t1_fets12m,1579380222.0,"From what I remember, all the gods have their designed areas, but Ra’s is designed as though it is for the enemy of Ra, Apep, the serpent. Also, the croud shouts throughout the map “Death to Ra”. I can’t remember any other evidence rn since I haven’t touched the map in months but, that’s the major thing I do remember"

AskReddit,feimwh4,t1_feicmbu,1579142262.0,"Ask imo can be seen in a sad way. Although it has a very cheery melody, it’s about a guy wanting love from a girl and saying that if they’re not united in love, then they will be united when they both die from bombing in the Cold War. I find most of the Smiths catalogue has some form of terrible beauty to it, on how it can sound so cheery and upbeat when being about a subject so sad"

The date 7th of July of the old Gregorian Calendar arrives, and Bungie sends a picture to their followers eyedrives, a round plate with symbols of fish, snakes, and dragons. Wish 15 is finally released"

DestinyTheGame,fc3l9v7,t1_fc3g3ur,1577392364.0,"The travel from the tower and back is a real mood killer when I’m playing tbh. When I’m using my PC, it loads quite quickly so I’m happy to run to the tower, get all my bounties, then go round the system doing things, but if I’m on Xbox, it’s a whole other story. The loading in takes 2/3 times as much, and considering you have to do this once for the tower then once for each activity you want to go into, it’s a real buzzkill imo"
