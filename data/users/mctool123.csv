These are the type of tards that think they have one up on others but it's their lack of self awareness that gives them this false impression. Moron thinks government is where compassion derives from. That's special (ed) of you to think that."
metacanada,fensqig,t1_fen4u3d,1579290159.0,"Poor people, around here, trash the living hell out of the area. If they just camped that would be one thing but they take garbage, from garbage day, open the bags and just spread it everywhere.

Then the city crews are out cleaning up after them and I'm supposed to ""feel"" for these people whom trash and disrespect the city that's enabling their behavior while burdening tax payers."
canada,femo46r,t1_felijgh,1579264359.0,"Ya how it is true Iran's government is actively harassing victims? They accidentally shoot a plane done, supposedly, then harass victims.

Trumps fault - you guys. 

You dont need to support trump to have that position it's not his fault, here."
canada,femnypi,t1_fekunwd,1579264201.0,"I do because this sub is a tabloid, at best, and that's the direction its kept in. Surprised beaverton articles arent dominating the top posts."
canada,femnxgw,t3_epn5c5,1579264165.0,"Is that trumps fault, too, Canada subreddit? If he didnt kill that general, iran wouldnt shoot the plane and then harass the families afterwards?"
canada,femnm6f,t1_femkvo3,1579263842.0,"Let me ask you, instead. Do you think you're ""compassionate"" because you listed those three things? 

If the other person doesnt agree, are they, according to you and your compassion, heartless? 

Because being for those things isnt the same as actually having a way to fund them, participate in them, etc. I can sit here all day saying I care about homeless people but if I do nothing for them do I really care? That's how most are with the 3 things you listed minus the last item which is a discussion onto itself, equality for all. 

Of outcome?

I think curing disease might trump or coincide health care, what government spending do we do on that? Any? We could sit here all day and come up with amazing things government should spend on but yiure talking about a government that manages to make billions disappear then not be accountable for it. For that reason I dont want government doing what you want them to do."
canada,femnei1,t3_epndgc,1579263618.0,"This must be an example of right wing slant I keep hearing about, another f doug ford discussion.

Oh wait,this is also where the majority left wing commenters start trashing Alabama folk. Such tasteful discussion in this subreddit.

And people think this sub is right leaning. Just wow. Wow all day."
