I feel happy for her that she dropped such a shallow guy and is smart enough to realize personality > everything. She must’ve realized how important having a good personality was after dating you.
relationship_advice,ff56u2v,t3_eroy34,1579581907.0,You both sound very young. There’s not a terribly whole lot else you can do. She needs to get help. All you can do is be there for her and support her which it sounds like you are since you’re constantly worried about her and trying to appease her. She’s not going to get better if she doesn’t help herself. You could do everything she asks you to but if she has her problems and doesn’t sort through them she’ll remain miserable.

childfree,ff5682r,t3_eroy82,1579581389.0,"I can see where you’re coming from but people come here to be happy about what they have. Sure not all CF people are rich. I think the point is that they have significantly more wealth because they don’t have kids. You could argue the whole sub is classist or something since many people experiencing poverty may not have access to contraception, sex ed, choice to abort, or choice in it at all. Yet here are tons of people shitting on parents when some never wanted to be parents to begin with. I think most of us are aware of those issues and the fact we do not all have money to blow or whatever. But this is a safe place to be able to toot your own horn for having “it” since it’s generally a taboo subject. So idk it doesn’t surprise me that it’s a frequent subject"

AmItheAsshole,ff40vrm,t3_erh1qw,1579553115.0,"YWBTA. First off, feral cats are notorious for being more challenging. You really should’ve researched that beforehand. Yes some feral/barn cats are total love bugs but generally, they can require extra work. Thus why we got a younger kitten that had been raised in a foster home with people, cats, and dogs for nearly his whole life. Secondly, it’s only been 3 weeks. My cat and dog took about 3/4 weeks to be ok with each other. But he peed on the bed and floor on and off for two/three months. Did that absolutely suck? Of course. Did we give him away? No. Thirdly, you have another animal. In addition to being stressed about a new surrounding and human, they have to navigate getting along with another animal. Your kitten has A LOT to get used to. My cat is great but you know what? We can’t live anywhere with carpets or rugs bc he pees on them. It’s incredibly frustrating that our ability to find housing is dictated by a 15 lb cat but we would NEVER get rid of him because we CHOSE him and made a promise. Stick it out OP. Some nuts are harder to crack. My second dog is super anxious. Took months for her to even wag her tail and not stare blankly totally disengaged from her surroundings. A full year later she’s much better but we have a long way to go."
relationship_advice,ff3nhwh,t3_erh1sc,1579544833.0,"...so he literally told you he’s in love with his ex? Oof girl do you really want to ride that train? I think it’s perfectly normal to miss some aspects of a person or still cherish some memories. The big difference is that they stay in the past and you move on. Which sounds like he’s doing neither since he brings her up, and calls you the wrong name. Also sounds like he hasn’t moved on since he confessed he still loves her. You can of course try couples therapy, but trust me, it will be hard. My husband cheated with an ex and had inappropriate relationships with other exes when we first got together. It rocked our ship for two years. We got through it but it was a ton of work. He went above and beyond to make me feel good about us. He was willing to go to therapy or do whatever it took to fix it, and we did. It still hurts even 5 years later. But if you do choose to stay with him and get through this together, be aware you cannot hold this over his head. The whole point of getting through it is to fix your relationship and move past his transgressions. If you bring them up during fights that is completely unfair since you have chosen to move through this together. It will hold both of your healing back and chip away at the new foundation of your relationship. 

IMO, I would tread very carefully. I was lucky in a sense that my husband cheated in the way he did. It was not very involved emotionally whereas your bf still seems to be tied in that way. And those kinds of bonds can be very tough to sever. It’s slightly alarming he’s been (theoretically happy since y’all move in together) with you for so long and still has these feelings. Wish you the best, and remember to take care of yourself first and foremost. I love my husband but if he ever fucks up again, I’m gone and he knows it. And I’m perfectly okay with severing that tie if I need to because I know I am a boss lady and will be fine. Find THAT strength because whichever direction you go, you’ll need it."

I’ve gone back and forth whether to count the first guy for over 10 years lol. I wish it had been more special but oh well, what’s done is done. I’ve had plenty of meaningful (and not so meaningful) experiences since then. Luckily, you get to choose your next experiences. Maybe you aren’t a one night stand kinda person. AND THAT IS TOTALLY FINE. But don’t feel bad or alone, plenty of peoples first times aren’t the magical experience it’s built up to be. Did he use a condom though? Always use a condom and have your own! I always packed my own because if you don’t know someone, you don’t know their motives. Or some guys are just dumb and have had the same condom in their wallet for months (which isn’t good for condoms.) Some guys will make excuses for not using condoms-do not fall for their bullshit. It’s not worth your health. And if you try anal, use plenty of lube. To me, sounds like he was having trouble getting hard if you couldn’t feel it even when he went in your ass (even a finger width w/o lube is very obvious there’s something in there lol.) Don’t let it deter you from exploring your sexuality. But maybe be a bit choosier. Sure sometimes a random one night stand can knock it out of the park. But in my experience, it takes knowing someone a bit to make it feel really good. It took me over 20 partners to find my husband-and he’s the first one to make me cum, ever. I don’t regret my past, and even though I didn’t cum it was great sex (sometimes) and I had a lot of fun. Don’t be afraid to voice your needs. If something does/doesn’t feel good, say something. Communication helps make for great sex. And just because you invited someone over, start kissing, oral, whatever, you always have the right to call it off. If you ain’t feeling it, you can always tap out."

They also let their other dog off leash in a city setting and the dog of course got hit by a car and died. What’d they do? Adopt another. Oh and they got a cat when we adopted our dog and declawed it and the cat became super fucked up after so they rehomed him. OH AND they watched my guinea pig for a week, failed to tell me he stopped drinking water, and he died. I forgot how awful they were with animals until now jfc"

childfree,fcnytg9,t3_ehzdsc,1577821058.0,"My moms best friend (pretty much an auntie at this point) is single with no kids. Having her in my life I think has shaped it for the better. She has a wonderfully fulfilling job, travels when she wants, can afford whatever, and has tonnnnnns of friends and support since she’s able to devote so much time and energy into those relationships. I am very lucky to have such a bad ass single woman role model my whole life."
