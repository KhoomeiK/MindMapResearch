RocketLeague,ffho3bj,t3_etiih3,1579944800.0,"Instead of pushing to DX11 you could've gone to Vulkan like so many other devs have. Easy crossplatform compatibility. 

Instead of promising refunds you could've mentioned it's only for the base game, not for the keys I've bought back when you weren't a subsidiary of Epic Megacorps. Yknow, back when I still wanted to support you? Also would've been nice to know the refund only comes in form of Steam funds which is is means pretty much zilch to me since I prefer GOG and purchasing directly from the devs nowadays.

So I bought the game for 9,99$ again after receiving 20$ refund because I'd rather take 10$ off you and still keep playing until the support ends(and hell, maybe someone will figure out how to hack in dedicated servers and we can all just pirate the game instead). Maybe I'll find some indie dev that's worth my 7$ they'll get after valve grabs a cut.

Still, fuck you for not considering the microtransactions part of the refund, I specifically requested it in my support request both to you and steam. 

And still fuck you for selling out to Epic. I just can't believe that the DLCs and tens of millions copies sold made you think ""hmm we better sell our soul so we can make it"". You had a goose laying golden eggs, and you decided to sell it and have the new owners gut it. Way to go Psyonix, way to go."
