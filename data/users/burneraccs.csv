AskReddit,ff5vef5,t1_ff3sw1e,1579611572.0,"I had one of the nicest experiences with emergency rooms once. It was a sunny Sunday morning in summer and I started to feel a blunt pain in my stomach. I knew this pain, had gone through a series of kidney stones a couple of months before. So I dropped what I was doing, took my shoes and my papers and headed out to the hospital on foot (cca 10 mins). At the final intersection I was almost crawling across the road, I was in such a pain, got into the hospital, getting to the check-in, the nurse sitting there looked at my agonizing face for a moment and the only question she asked was: ""Kidney stone?""  I was nodding in distress, mumbling a quiet ""Yeah"". She stood up and said: ""This way, please."" and got me to the nearest room. It was like having being offered the presidential suite at this five-star hotel."
