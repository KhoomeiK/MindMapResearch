politics,ffgv9ea,t1_ffgqtj3,1579915936.0,"""Strategic"" votes for compromise candidates are exactly why the U.S. has been pulled so far right. Democrat voters give ground out of fear, the party becomes more centrist, the entire country shifts right, and that's how you end up with the current administration over time.

Not voting for the candidate you truly think is best seriously shoots you in the foot over a few election cycles, and in my opinion is just straight up undemocratic."

They can see it clear as day in their minds eye, just the same as you could. In this world it's wrong, and it might not be criminal since it's so ubiquitous, but it's arguable that it ought to be."
wholesomememes,fectv7h,t1_fect8gs,1578984406.0,"As much as I've liked Crews, it seems like at best he's touting Chinese culture at a time when the government is under serious global public scrutiny, at worst he's been paid to speak well of a fascist regime.

Also trying to equate being trans or being genetically non-binary to having a scar or some other blemish is absurdly reductive and naive.

AskReddit,fec5h60,t1_fec2tr0,1578966943.0,"All of those situations are anomalous though, they're outside the norm. Your body might not respond properly to testosterone, or you might have XXY sex chromosomes, but those are rare accidents of incorrectly copied DNA. And yeah, that's how evolution happens, but most changes to DNA are dead ends.

And yeah, secondary characteristics are what most people find initially attractive, since we don't walk around with our bits exposed, but it is still understandable that people would consider those secondary characteristics deceitful once genitalia are revealed."

However, most people do not agree. Most people would say they are fundamentally not the gender they claim to be. And it's a fair point. Because at a nuts and bolts level, they aren't. It might be upsetting, but it doesn't mean they're totally wrong."
AskReddit,febv7su,t1_febrbm1,1578963075.0,"For most people, trans women do lack some essential womanhood. Be it the second X chromosome, naturally grown reproductive organs, different hormones, whatever.
