NEET,ffcce3n,t3_esq2xj,1579796418.0,"Ordered a whetstone and a new victorinox knife for my beloved cooking. Also a bunch of ingredients - mostly spices and vegetables (I rarely eat meat).
Also started collecting things for my first cosplay - trying to do Yoshikage Kira. Today in a thrift shop I saw a very nice striped shirt similiar to his - it fit me perfectly. Also ordered some resins to try and make the Sheer heart attack bomb. For his suit I'll just buy a cheap white jacket from thrift and paint it light purple same for pants. I am trying to get it done for a big polish convention in may xd.
Well - I fucked half of my pay for these things (I work at mcdonalds - I don't have other choice)"
Doomers,fele4j4,t1_felcedt,1579220037.0,I am not saying that they are depressed utterly because of their political views. But a lot of leftist people have certain traits that in turn make them depressed. It's all about relativity xd.

I met a guy who lived in an apartment with a girl, they were friends but neither of them thought of another as a possible partner. Both the girl and guy were ""beautiful people"" - succesfull, outgoing, very helpful... and both had partners xD

She reported me to the main manager that I am undermining her status and disrespectful.
I really don't get it - why the hell are people so weirdly overzealous and rude for a pension only little above the country's minimum xD. 
Everyday I come to the flat exahusted - both mentally and physically only to get further shouted at by my ""landlords"" (my creators whom I never saw as parents because of their attitude).
I never had any friends (I have adhd slight autism naimgly spd plus bipolar and bpd combo - results of disfunctional household which make me totally unworthy of anyones attention leaving asife when theylaugh at me), let alone a girl, my only form of ""socialising"" outside work nowadays is ... badoo. Unfortunately most of the time the conversation dies down quickly or the girl just wants a hookup...
I don't see any reason for living - as my only dreams left are the pragmatical, doable but toally hedonistic and ambitionless ones (I am learning coding so I could one day work remotely from Thailand - even though I never been abroad further than to Belgium,to work nonetheless- two countries aways from my poland).
I tried to end it all afew times already, starting as early as when I was 10 - but after being close to it I got too much of a paranoid fear of becoming totally disabled instead of dying...

But since I fucked up it because of my autism, lack of experience dealing with people (I was always bullied, never had anyone I could call friend) I fell into ruin. But now at least I could get rid of my bad bevahiours and thinking I inherited from my disfunctional creators. I realised that you shouldn't depend on the other person emotionally if you wanna be happy. But also I realised that having that special someone can be super motivating - because you start improving yourself so that person will notice you. But this person doesn't have to be your ""lover"" - that person can even be a great friend for whom you could do anything

I tried inviting people out countless times - just my autism(I have spd) makes me unable to converse with people normally.
It's also that I honestly hate, totally don't enjoy a lot of ""normal people things"" - starting from chess, gossiping, all those social media especially snapchat (I used to have facebook but even though I was active on groups I never got any messages aside from when I started chats which quickly died down) .

Like literally whenever I see a comment about being from a broke / broken families and getting happy life are coming from girls. Rarely you hear about guys getting out of total shithole, and when you hear - in 9/10 of cases they had support from friends / family. Something for example I never had, ok I have a slight form of this - financial as I can still live at my creators flat (though living with them always was hell but hey I have no other option being unskilled mentally disabled person) so at least my situation isn't as bad as others (though I had a month in my life where I was totally homeless). But emotionally my creators are two little borderline kids, especially the male sparking 2-3 arguments EVERY SINGLE DAY over the smallest things. Oh and his emotional overdependency also brought my twisted view of other humans, which I only managed to solve... by going full psycho - no emotional attachment means little pain after all.
How the fuk is a person suppossed to function normally when all his life everything he heard were shouts and insults, either at home ot school. How can a person function after years of being called trash, beaten up, spit on, even having pernament damage done.

Firstly programming, leaving aside using conversation to get advice on problems, is as interesting topic to talk about as for example defecation... Secondly there's no way for me to meet new people in IT in near future, as in my region there aren't any IT meet ups, nor do I know personally any person working in the IT.  
One of my mosty liked hobbies is kinda expensive (of course for me, a poor polish slave) and for most of my  implementation ... it was illegal.

Can count the times I went out with someone on fingers of my hands...
