IAmA,felesij,t1_felcq4j,1579220479.0,"Suffolk County, NY has the highest paid police force in the state at approximately 136K per year, 185% higher than the national average. It's a super wealthy county (that's where the Hamptons are) on Long Island, and I believe there's a wait list to get to be a police officer there. Nearby Nassau County has an annual pay of approximately 61K. 

I would imagine clearance rate has to do with a better staffed, better paid department with more resources.

This is not to diminish how hard those police officers are working (because for sure, they are), just wanted to point out that better funding often begets better results."

Wear a dress with pockets bc we went dressed down and folks definitely stared. The roast chicken was amazing and worth the money even for us broke college students. I still think about that chicken 16 years later.

***DO NOT eat the pizza in Scotland. Worst I've ever had. No, I PROMISE  you are not that hungry.  Eat chocolate instead. ***

Also, there's a fun graveyard tour you should do in Edinburgh. I  unhelpfully don't remember the name, but you got to go underground to some catacombs and it was awesome.

I did the Ripper Dungeon in London, and it did feel  pretty exploitive towards the victims. Left a bad taste in my mouth. I would skip.

Tower Of London does a nice exhibit on torture in the Middle Ages, (you also get to see where Anne Boleyn was executed and where they found the boys in the Tower), and the Victoria and Albert Museum has a whole giant room of statues the museum bought during the Victorian era that ended up being fakes that was pretty cool, and they have delicious baked goods in their cafe. I wholeheartedly recommend you do both.

Side note: If you drink tea black, you have to ask bc everywhere I went in London assumed you want milk and sugar."

Diane Downs, played by the great Farrah Fawcett, attempts to murder her three children ( she did unfortunately succeed with one and her other two children were seriously injured) because her new boyfriend didn't want children. Then, we went to the grocery store, and there was the Ann Rule book all about it just waiting for me! 

I bought it with my allowance and read the whole thing before my dad found out and took it away from me. It was replaced by Little House on the Prairie books for the rest of the summer. AND, I wasn't allowed Nancy Drew for a while after that ( it's ok, I got them back eventually.) After that, I learned to hide my True Crime books better."
