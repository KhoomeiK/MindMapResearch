leagueoflegends,ffzb25h,t1_ffz4p11,1580370339.0,"I love how varied the support role is, there's so many ways to play the role and every match is so different based on lane comps and how the early trades go, where a small difference in what people do on a single engagement can cause anything from one player damaged but not enough to want to back, to only one of the four players surviving the engagement. 

Brand is a great support because if an enemy comes too close they'll lose a chunk of health, it won't kill them but a few pokes of that means the next engage likely will. Scales absurdly and can delete entire teams in the right situations, but that's past the point in the game where he's a support. 

Veigar is a great support for the same reasons as Brand and has a very similar kit to Brand, but loses the great multi-target damage in favor of one of the best crowd control abilities in the game in the form of his cage. It's big, it stuns for a long time, and it's great for keeping your ADC and yourself safe as well as catching foes and dooming them to certain death. Despite having a similar AoE and skillshot, Veigar doesn't have the same multi-target stopping power with his early game poke as Brand does, for him it's all about the cage and the poke is more for stacking purposes. 

(oh god, I just thought of how evil Brand/Veigar duo bot would be, and not just evil lore-wise)

Blitzcrank is great for catching out enemies that stray too far. 

Leona is great for diving an enemy that doesn't want to fight, then being hard to kill and dealing out stuns so her ADC can get them. 

Nautilus is somewhere between Blitzcrank and Leona, he drags himself and an enemy together and deals out roots, so a more aggressive Blitzcrank and a safer Leona. 

Pyke is decent at hooking, and is squishy but can escape well, but he's all about filling up the ADC's bank account and ideally his own in the process. 

Janna it's great disengage, if someone dives the ADC she's probably the best at making said enemy no longer be attached to your ADC and that's a beautiful thing when it works. 

Then there's heal supports, shield supports, stat buff supports, basically there's a support for anyone. Maybe even a lot of them."

Thresh has a great background but nothing in game. Kallista is decent but a little underwhelming, I like that she refers to herself as a collective and barely remembers her name, but it doesn't really go beyond that. Lucian and Senna have cool voiceovers but don't really talk about the Ruination, I'm glad they have the modern aspect with the current state of the Shadow Isles and the rivalry with Thresh, but I just want more Ruination. I haven't played Hecarim, he's on my list for sure. 

And then Yorick, he talks about the Ruination, he talks about modern day Shadow Isles and working to reverse the Ruination, he has great communication with everything around him from the Maiden to his revived ghouls. And he's got multiple internal conflicts from his disagreements with the voice in his head to his conflict over killing inocents to raise his army to save the isles, ""What's one more grave?"" says so much about his characterization.

You've gotta make a move, otherwise you're just a friend who has a crush. 

If he makes a move and she rejects him, he needs to give up and move on, either being content with just being friends or ending the friendship if he can't handle being around her but not with her. That's not the friend zone, he's given a decision to either be friends or not be, there's no implication of a future relationship if he stays so if he stays it should be as a friend.

Sure, one person can't prevent the climate apocalypse on their own but by being complacent the main character of the story just lets it happen around them. By not doing anything they've doomed the world and society to their fates, and despite all the previous denial they realized that they've brought death upon the world because they couldn't put forth the effort to make a difference. 

Actually now that I'm looking at the lyrics of the whole song, the entire thing could be about this. Ah shoot I was trying to go to bed but now I guess I'm dissecting Toh Kay at 2 in the morning with 7 hours until class. Fun!

The whole first verse but specifically this:

>Would you be upset if I told you we were dying?

>And every cure they gave us was a lie?

>Oh! They mean it when they say we're dead and doomed

Those people saying that the world as we know it is ending because of climate change, they were right.

>And every single symptom brings us closer to the tomb

Species dying off, crazy wildfires destroying Australia, California, and the Rainforest, frequent record-breakimg hurricanes, 70° in early January in areas that used to always get snow around that time. 

>And who will take the credit for our swift impending fall

> Because it's not my fault

But the narrator denied that they did any of this, it's other people, it's the big business, it's China, the singer just wants to live their life because""I'm doing my part!"" By occasionally using their reusable bags or something like that. Maybe they still eat steak because they like it and it's easier to ignore the reasons not to eat it than to cut it out of their diet.

> All the time we're spending vaccinating this disease

>I just get dizzy when I think of all the ways we try to hide our maladies

We put out the fires, we rebuild after the hurricanes, we use prison labor to clean the garbage on the side of the road and send it to China so they can burn it and we can deny any involvement.

-

>Now you're upset because you finally got the notion

>That everything you had is spinning down the drain

Yeah, maybe you realize how much we're affecting the climate and how short the road to ruin may turn out to be, and it's stressing you out big time. What'll the world be like in 30 years, what species will still be around? How many modern cities are gonna be to arid or aquatic to live in, or will have just been leveled by hurricanes and never rebuilt?

>Oh! Do you mean it when you beg and pray and plead?

>Your ""Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me all those things we need""

You want society to change so we're not destroying everything anymore, but at what cost? Loss of the comforts of modern day life? Maybe you still want red meat. Still want fresh fruit. Still want candy and other individually packaged snack foods. But all of those directly contribute to many problems in many ways. 

-

>Like moths that fly into the flame it always ends up so

>You scream: ""Not me! Take anybody else!

>Because it's not my fault!""

We've as a species doomed so much of the current world's species including likely ourselves, but instead of slowing down or trying to reverse what we've done it's like we're on a train heading towards a cliff and speeding up. And it was a group effort, but none of us did this on our own. It was nobody's fault because everyone partook and we couldn't have done it alone. 

And then the verse from your comment, to tie it all together.

And don't forget the title track of the album, ""We Will Fall Together"". And ""One Foot on the Gas, One Foot in the Grave"". And ""Watch it Crash"". I didn't realize how well the album fits together but so much of it is about death and disaster. 

Another song of his/theirs from a different album is ""The Saddest Song"", with the great chorus

> And now I'm off to save the world once again,

> But I don't know how I'll pull it off this time,

> I think I'm going to drown.

This isn't the original meaning but it just has a great sense of attempting to fix something big but not really having any idea if it's even possible. Can we save the earth? We can try. Maybe it's too late, maybe we're just in time. But we've gotta try at least. Insert this right before the last verse in Would You Be Impressed and it's a great rallying cry followed by the warning for if people don't do their part."

leagueoflegends,ffudt2i,t1_fftok0l,1580239856.0,"There's definite advantages, I was a jungle main for a while and during that period I would get sick of lane when going back to laners on occasion, because you can't just ignore the Veigar/Nasus as a laner where playing Jungle you can just run away and go somewhere else. 

Not that you necessarily should, I'm not saying I was a good jungler, but it's less stressful that that's an option that you can just go somewhere else."

Just play something safe like ranged top cancer and don't let the enemy snowball off killing you, but keep enough pressure on them that they can't ignore you or leave. Either bot wins or mid wins, but the important thing is that you didn't lose your team the game. Play Quinn, play safe, don't feed, and be useful late game because you're an ADC who can be anywhere fast and keep yourself and your team relatively safe with your Q and E."
