I get they are professionals but it was a wee bit of tape mate. Also ""Tiocfaidh ár lá* merchants"" lol, aye make assumptions about folk based on how they vote on a reddit comment, clever you must be. Also Tiocfaidh ár lá is an old Irish proverb, genuinely don't get the message you're trying to get across."

ScottishFootball,ffangcu,t3_esfwsv,1579740068.0,"Kilmarnock 3 - 3 Gretna. 

I used to play in youth teams that partnered with Kilmarnock so we would get tickets occassionally for games. For some reason one we got waa vs. Gretna and Kilmarnock were up 3-0 at the first half. Then Killie bottled it 3-3. 


The reason it was my favourite is because we were behind the goals and somebody shot the ball into the crowd and I managed to get a head on it, obviously a professional footballers blasting shot is hard for a 13 year old to control so it when lower than I had hoped... right into the back of the head of some woman 2 rows down. I was buckled and couldn't stop laughing, she was shouting some abuse but ye can imagine a team if 20 odd 13-14 year olds just pishing themselves, ye'd feel invincible.  Was well funny and that was back when the pies were good. We got coupons from the club for a free pie and drink so I got a tea cause it was freezing. Was a good wee day out despite the abysmal performance on the pitch."
soccer,ff8tnhn,t1_ff8sa9w,1579695663.0,">If Celtic and Rangers could get on in the European cups, they'd prioritise them.


Both literally just played a League cup final after both advanced to knock-out stages of EL. Kinda of a wasted statement. Scottish football fans would rather watch an Old Firm cup final than a Celtic vs Man United and a Rangers vs Wolves quarter finals set.  The expand your brand mentality doesn't work when the reality is Scotland cares more about the pitch-side atmosphere than it ever will about TV money. That's why per capita it's the best selling nation in UEFA leagues by a hefty margin."
soccer,ff8ta4m,t1_ff8r6ea,1579695267.0,"If it was a for fun exhibition tourny during the summers of non WC/Euro years, sure mate. But Scottish players already dominate the most minutes played every season in world football(big up CalMac), so it's not realistic."
ScottishFootball,ff8h0zx,t1_ff8gpjy,1579678116.0,"I'm not here to argue, you'll have your bias, I have mine. IMO Fraser Forster is by a mile the best goalkeeper in the country, Elhamed uninjured absolutely rinsed a team several magnitudes stronger than Rangers(Lazio), Edouard vs Morelos debate is a debate for a reason, imo Rangers biggest thing this season was not needing to rely on him as much, but personally I think Edouard can deal with more than Morelos. Morelos even in an already won game can't handle the pressure enough to not get sent off. McGregor's biggest quality is his adaptibility but that's not his strongest use, he's far better in a forward facing triangle than a rearward one.  Ntcham is severely underutilized purely because he shares a role with Broony, but Ntcham can be world class. Dunno, I watch every single game of Scottish football(I'm a sado, I know) and that's just my takeaway, but as a Celtic supporter I will 100% hold my hands up and say there will obviously be bias."

I like a super tender steak doesn't fall apart when you pick it up, but you bite through it like it's nothing. That's what I want in my ribs. Soft enough it's nothing for me teeth but not so soft it's a bitch to gravity."

The ones at Rugby Park are shite next to the OG. Still better than our pies tbh but shite compared to what they were."
ScottishFootball,ff8ajvj,t1_ff71nm0,1579670968.0,"Players wise we are player for player the best in Scotland. The issues we've have been based on how Lennon has strategised the games. Like the first OF at Ibrox? He learned from last year, 2-0 win away. The home game? Complacent, too reliant on individual key players(like Rangers had been last season) and it bit us in the arse. Gerrard learned and adapted. The managers are going punch for punch, balls in Lennons court. Am I ever happy with our transfer windows? No. We have so much money and so much room to take risk but never do, which is disappointing but it's a bit too early to say. I'm not at Lennoxtown training facility week in, week out analysing players in training. Couple of decent outgoings, Sinclair to Preston, Morgan supposedly to Miami, Lee O'Connor looking to maybe get first team action rest of the season at Thistle.


I've not got a lot to say on it, I think we've done better than any other Scottish team, but whether it even matters is down to how we are managed. Games are won on the pitch. We dropped points to Livingstone and Rangers dropped points to the worst Hearts squad I've seen in forever. These things happen.

The football is exciting, got a good position in Europe. Can't moan too much over 2 shite games one at our bogey pitch and another when we just didn't show up. We've got the rest of an exciting season to look forward to."

I get that they want to paint him better as it's probably someone who was there through the glory days where for basically years while CS 1.6 was transitioning into CSGO, F0rest and GeT_RiGhT were just beyond unreal, but for the sake of 0.03 to a rating? It's a bit pathetic. We all know F0rest is a legend, don't need to bullshit stats to fit that narrative."

It's only if it's something that full on impedes movement is surgery called in.
