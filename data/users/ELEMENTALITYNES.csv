I've actually tried mixing Pink K with Solei Free, but the Solei Free actually woke me up more than Pink K put me to sleep, which has happened both times I tried them together.

I have a bit of a dilemma and was hoping you could maybe pitch in with your experience with it. I was looking for a strain to ease anxiety before sleep, and I've tried North Star and Solei Free, which both have completely different effects for me. Free wakes me up while North Star is nice before sleep for me, but the issue is the price, and I was really hoping Charlotte's Web had effects more similar to North Star than Solei Free."

I'm right hand dominant in most things, like throwing, pushing/pulling in the gym, opening doors, vacuuming, spanking the donkey, choking the chicken, polishing the dragon, seasoning my meatloaf, and not to mention masturbating. I've tried writing with my left hand before and I can make handwriting look decent, but it takes me significantly longer than my right hand. Also, no one in my family, including grandparents or great grandparents have been left-handed.

What I do find strange though is that my left hand does seem to be a bit better at dexterity, while my right hand is better at gross/overall mechanics, meaning more power related stuff. I always open bottles using my left hand on the lid, if I need to find/pick up small screws/bolts I use my left hand, and I generally have more fine movement and sensation with my left hand. Maybe I just need to train my left hand at writing."

Then they're worried about brick and mortars going under, like they can solve 3 problems all at the same time: get people to bring their own containers and give a discount to whoever does. Brings more business to B&Ms, brings down the price slightly of some expensive ass weed, and helps the packaging issue, all at the same time."

The commenter stated that when these two do not separate, it becomes near impossible to open the bottle because there's no threading on the lower plastic ring, so if you keep trying to turn the lid it can strip the threading on the inside of the lid making it even more difficult to remove the lid.

It feels like the MLB has been trying to keep this as low profile as possible to prevent it from going public to reduce chances of profit loss.

The umpires union prevents automated strikezones and real punishments to umpires when they go on a power trip, the players association prevents individual players from receiving harsh penalties for blatant cheating, the desire to maintain an appeal to old head stubborn fans (who probably hold season tickets a.k.a. money) prevented the expansion of nets to protect the fans up until this year, etc. To ban cheating, we either need a new more progressive commissioner, or we need Manfred to get his head out of his ass and make some fundamental and structural changes to the way a ton of things operate instead of trying to sweep massive pieces of evidence under the rug and hoping everyone just forgets everything so he doesn't lose too much money."
TheOCS,feo6cz8,t1_fenfcp8,1579295751.0,"Not OP but this is my experience. I have North Star as well as Solei Free. I was looking for a CBD that's good to take at night to help relieve some anxious thoughts. North Star I actually love before bed, I fall asleep easily and can stay asleep. I thought I could save money with Solei Free so I gave it a try twice now, but it actually wrecked my sleep. I keep opening my eyes when lying down at night, and it takes a couple hours getting over that to fall asleep, even when combining it with a sleep tea and some valerian. It doesn't make me more anxious or anything like that, but it just wakes me up.

I've looked extensively at the profiles of both strains, both look to be nearly the exact same, they both have similar percentages of CBD, and I think Solei has maybe one or two more terpenes than North Star. I have yet to try Solei Free during the day, but I guess that's when I have to use it. It's pretty crazy that 2 strains that looks to be the exact same can have such different effects. It's just unfortunate how insanely pricey North Star is because it's double the price of Solei Free."
