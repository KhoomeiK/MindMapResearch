GRE,ffen3nt,t1_ffe5lvp,1579855340.0,"Judging by your score, you must have had a sausage before bed, for breakfast, and during the 10-minute break! Congrats!

Did Manhattan verbal end up being useful? Vocab or RC?"

GRE,ffb324o,t3_esdhy2,1579750531.0,"By no means are you pusillanimous. You demonstrate alacrity with your persistence. It would behoove you... Here's a précis of what to... I've belie my beacon of hope, I've no advice."
GRE,ff923h1,t3_esbbn7,1579702940.0,"I don't want to stop your cacophony, but the usual canon is to keep at verbal. PP1 vocab is apparently easier than the real deal (I emphasize this because it is your second language)."
GRE,ff57q5y,t3_erdwh4,1579582683.0,"You must follow a canon of practice routines to prepare for any capricious, random questions on the next test. I forsee a propitious future. Go about studying without being pusillanimous or antipathy towards the test material."

GRE,ff5755i,t3_ero67p,1579582169.0,Surprised there's not more of a cacophony. Is this prep company not meeting the expected canon?
GRE,ff20gp9,t3_er5fq3,1579490516.0,"I aver that accolades are not by mere capricious events, but by punticilous and dogged determination.

GRE,fesbjcn,t3_epw0ct,1579363533.0,"Studying may seem like an anagram, but just trust with time and resources here it will be an amalgam. It will all come together. I truly maintain this point, and hope my missive isn't coming off as bromide."
GRE,feqvtny,t3_eqdg2u,1579346670.0,"A bit of bromide advice, and by no means as extensive as a punticiliously written missive, but the Manhattan is usually a good indicator of Q +/- 3 (usually Manhattan Q underestimates). The V is trash."
GRE,fe7s3pg,t1_fe6c17w,1578918595.0,"I like Victor Prep's (@SamFold) philosophy on this: **Vocab for life, not just for standardized tests.**

I have heard the exact opposite in regards to testing experience (though both sides of the coin exist). Extensive vocabulary reviews with words one has never seen except on test day.

I guess if you find a reason for learning vocabulary beyond standardized tests, there's only benefits :)"
getdisciplined,fe3gg89,t1_fe15xj5,1578849056.0,"To claim perfection is committing a solecism. It is a misuse of words, but you can never be perfect. Perfection is an abstract concept with arbitrary premises."
HumansBeingBros,fe3ctl2,t1_fe31rhk,1578848118.0,For you
GRE,fdxyh0a,t3_en0x0y,1578774212.0,"I don't want to be that plastic duck, a **canard** (almost like the NARD dog from The Office who lies), that spews out false promises like in the fairy tales. Instead, I will be **candid**, honest and straightforward, and say that studying for the GRE can make you feel **impecunious** or **penurious**, both literally and figuratively. It is not a test that can be taken by a mere **philistine**, though I hope you do not take **umbrage** from my frankness, I'm not forcing you to **brook** my comments. You must go in not as a **martinet**, controlled as if you were marionette puppet, but rather a **martyr**\--someone who dies for their dreams.

Are my comments a bit extra? Sure, but they are by no means **extemporaneous**, slapdash, or impromptu. Will some people perceive this comment as **vitriol** and **invidious**? Perhaps, but my intention is not to be **virulent** or **blight**. I hope people see the light.

Whatever way you go, I am sure you and your wife will go at a pace that does not train your senses (**insensible**) or mental capacities (to the point of being irrational) from exhaustion."
GRE,fdxwua1,t1_fdgvcro,1578773751.0,"exasperate (to irritate someone intensely) & exacerbate (to make worse): Aghasted by the horrors of his actions, his failed attempts to appease the situation only exacerbated matters, and only exasperated the implacable person further.

execrate (loathing; dislike or disgust) & excrete: In historical times, criminals were disliked and exiled, often shipped in a crate to a faraway land. They were treated like our excrements and no wonder, for their horrendous criminal actions were truly execrable. 

expurgate & excoriate (both mean to censor; excoriate could mean extreme hate): X-CORE HATE = Hardcore hate. Excoriate. Expurgate = Ex+ PURGE + gate. Think of throwing stuff away, like trash across your gated fence in your yard, to purge and censor the mess (e.g., fallen leaves are thrown on the other side if there is a forest).

exonerate & exculpate (both mean to clear of wrongdoing): Your honour, I find the plaintiff, NOT GUILTY. He is an EX-CULPRIT (exculpate) and will be EX - ONERATED. The onerated part of exonerating is related to onerous, which means a big burden. If you are ""EX"" (as in don't have) a big burden, you are free from it."
GRE,fdxu7ip,t1_fdkq6l0,1578772990.0,"The rising brand-new news magazine application **""APPRISE""** has been on the rise in the app store for its concise articles on recent world events.

Weary - Mnemonic: Wear or worn

Medieval knights must be wary of the state of their armour. For if it is well-worn and weary, it does not take a prescient oracle to predict a forlorn outcome in the next siege."

Ingenious: inventive

This one may not work for you, but it did for me:

""IM INGENIOUS! LOOK AT MY INVENTION!""

""No you're not, that was already invented 50 years ago!""

""Oh, I'm an innocent fraud then; I'm ingen**u**ous"" (think: ingenuous seems like a fraudulent version of ingenious, and usually one can consider frauds as innocent or naive--if they knew better, they wouldn't commit criminal acts)"
GRE,fdgg5s5,t1_fdfuxqn,1578395304.0,"Incomplete response:

Factious: Not to be confused with Factual. Antonym: Harmonious.

Indigent (synonyms: penniless; impecunious): If you think of ENTs, as in the anthropomorphized tree, they are often ""POOR"" in the sense of pitiful. You'll often hear sad stories about ENTs, ""poor ENTs"", as an analogy to the impending global warming epidemic."

GRE,fdcf645,t1_fdbr30y,1578273391.0,"Impudent = Shameless

Imprudence = Carelessness; rashness; without thinking of consequences

I like to remember Imp**rude**nce by ""RUDE"". Rude people often take the last slice of pizza, eat your leftovers, or don't wash their dishes. But, RUDE does not mean shameless. Rude people can feel shame.

Rude people can be impertinent, that is, not relevant. But the GRE can define impertinent as either ""irrelevance"", gauche (lack of social etiquette), or even as a synonym of impudence.

However, **impertinent** seems to be shamelessness or rudeness *in the context of social etiquette*. It makes sense, because pertinent = relevant. And in society, being irrelevant is considered rude or shameful! Like, if you talk about what your cat does for fun when you're not at home at a formal dinner party, that may be considered impertinent to some.

Impudent = General shamelessness or cheekiness. Impertinent = Shameless or rudeness when it comes to social etiquette. Imprudence = General carelessness or lack of forethought (not EXACTLY rude, but rude people tend to not be as conscientious)."

Now, if the professional opinion of the doctor is to **proscribe** something, you should almost certainly avoid it. Professionals, whether doctor, lawyer, or law enforcement, often proscribe things for our safety."

GRE,fd85ifc,t1_fd7uh2f,1578214106.0,"Baleful can also mean pernicious.

When you commit **baleful** actions, you are required to pay bail. Otherwise, you will be in a dull cell full of **doleful** people, all sorrowfully awaiting their further court proceedings.

On a related note, **indolent** = lazy. Those **indolent** and lazy GRE students procrastinated studying for the test until the night before, and when they see their scores, they will certainly be **doleful**."
