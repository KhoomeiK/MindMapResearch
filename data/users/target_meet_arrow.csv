I'd be more worried about having my Toyota Camry stolen than a Range Rover."

The car is registered to you. The DMV (or whatever your state calls it) has all the info and it's accessible by the police. Plus, I'm pretty sure cops will want to verify that the car is yours before they out out an apb for a stolen vehicle. 

They have the VIN, registration info, license plate, make, model, and insurance information (as long as you haven't changed it since your last registration. 

I have no idea why cops ask for the paperwork when they pull you over because they don't need to."

Sometimes we just aren't suited for others and it naive to say that being perfect everywhere else will be enough."

Just because you call something a data point doesn't mean that it is significant. 

I haven't seen a single person that knows anything about these works call them pornographic or would find it odd that an artist would have them. 

Typically these works are described as being lewd when talking about MJ while in context they images aren't. Kind of like if you paused a teen romcom during a sex scene and posted a screenshot. IMO this would be similar to my mom having Geddes photos. That one photo and saw she was found with nude photos of infants and toddlers and it sounds like she's a monster."

My wife and MIL are photographers and have a number of books that feature nude underage subjects. They aren't sexual in nature and therefore aren't pornographic. One of the books Jackson had was sexual in nature because it explored sexuality at those ages, but isn't pornographic. 

Again, I'm interested in what books or images you personally have a problem with or are you just going off of what you have heard about these books? It's pretty hard to judge art if you haven't even seen it."
