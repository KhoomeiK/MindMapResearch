SquaredCircle,ff2th16,t1_ff1mdzs,1579523475.0,"I haven't watched that interview with Chris Van Vliet, but I have listened to her interview on Jericho's Podcast and she was so full of herself. There's one thing to be confident, but she talked about herself and how awesome it is for like half the interview (if not more). I actually had to close it because I got sick of it.

Of course, I didn't know she was actually this bad, but now seeing this and thinking back about that interview, it kinda makes sense and I am also wondering if she's a psycopath who just doesn't see anything wrong about the bullsh\*t she's doing."
depression,ff1uav7,t1_ff1rr0t,1579486347.0,"Yeah, this is pretty much it.

Look, I'm a realist and I know it is really tough to find work (currently unemployed), but a toxic workplace is about one of the worst things in life.

 Consider that you spend a lot of your total time awake at work, and even if you're not at work you are preoccupied by it even if you're not a workaholic (you have to prepare for it, transport time, worrying about stuff related to it, etc). So a TOXIC environment in that area of your life is a big no no.

You should definitely prioritize getting out of there, but you have to be strategic about it.

As for me, well, I guess I just don't last very long in those kinds of setting. I tend to try to resolve things, so it either gets actually resolved with mature people or it gets worse with people with actual VENOM in their veins instead of blood."
SquaredCircle,ff1ddbe,t1_ff14m91,1579477748.0,"Yes, it is very disappointing when this happens.

But it's nice that you have realized this now to be honest. Like, this kind of thing isn't just for popular people like Tessa, there are tons of actual factual shitty people out there who are amazing at pretending to be nice people, or as you've said, gifted with talent and/or intelligence that they still become quite successful. Watch out for those. They're worse than the more obvious kind imho."
depression,ff0wycl,t3_doqwow,1579473079.0,"Yes, this is a very sensible sticky in my opinion.

I have been on both sides of this coin. As a ""helper"", I find that I didn't really help the person via a more live chatting or back and forth messaging. Posting a few replies on the person's thread and boosting them up is fine, but you it's just a whole new ballgame to try and be the person's friend/advisor.

As a helpee, I've found myself disappointed as the person (understandably) just seemed like they didn't actually care all that much with their proposal, and even if they did, it's just not what I was seeking (which is not their fault obviously!).

So yeah, in a way it might even worsen things sometimes. I'm all for support, but I think that it's actually best to just keep it on the thread."
depression,ff0t1cj,t3_eqyyej,1579472012.0,"Hmmm... I do agree with this thought process, but sadly, it's not the entire story though.

Yes, there are people like what you describe (I think I'm going to shamelessly include myself in there! :D), but... I have encountered my fair share of people who have lived through bad mental health periods or just bad life circumstances, and they have NOT become better... sometimes even the opposite.

An example would be my father. He has gone through a tough time a few years back, and me going through mild depression, you would think he'd be understanding and empathetic eh? Nope. It seems to me that he absolutely forgot that time of his life. Or that's how he copes with it. Now that he's ""fine"", he doesn't want anything to remind him of that time, so he isn't at all understanding of my plight."
offmychest,ff0rmmy,t1_ff00am4,1579471672.0,"Hmm... good info, and yeah that kinda changes my view. I thought it would be something more like a year or so.

And I reiterate that I might have been ""harsher"" than I should be with my viewpoint as well, maybe it's just the way that you tell your story in such a compact mode (like that's 3 months worth of things in a thread), and it made me feel like it's such a ""drama fest for nothing"" (again, sorry, I don't mean to be mean by that, I'm just lacking words I guess, haha).

Without a doubt though, this s\*cks and I'm sorry you're going through this. I don't know you well so I don't know what to say to make you feel better, but I reiterate what I say before, that do whatever you have to do to make yourself feel better when it gets bad. I've been in your shoes and it really hurts. It feels like betrayal, like they're just willing to throw something meaningful just like that... you know?

It will get better, though. Hopefully it will be sooner, rather than later for you."
offmychest,fezpsrr,t3_eqyi9k,1579460140.0,"Hello there! I have read your whole experience and I got some comments on it.

Firstly, like the other guy said, he took the first move to prevent himself from hurting more, I suppose. He sees that there's no future in it since you are leaving, so he just kind of moved on with his life.

Secondly, and I apologize in advance for how blunt I am with this, you guys are kinds confusing with the relationship/not in a relationship thing you were doing. I'm not super duper conservative and I get that we don't have to put a label on anything, but even though it might have worked somewhat, it seems that he maybe wanted more out of you than he let on. Probably? I dont even know, but maybe he wanted a bit more from you and you leaving for Europe kinda ruined that. But Im just guessing here.

Anyway, again, sorry for my previous comment, but the way I see it, as much as it hurts to have lost your....friend/fwb/potential bf whatever he was, I think it is better for you two as you are leaving anyway, and you wouldnt want a person with jealousy issues holding you back anyway. I hope you get over your broken heart about this sooner than later. I might have sounded harsh sometimes, but I have been where you are, I know how it hurts. Take care of yourself first and foremost."

depression,fes5val,t3_eqh1mt,1579361754.0,"I find it comforting to see that people of all walks of life go through the same things that I do.

And I like that some of the comments here are really helpful. Even when they're not addressed to me, sometimes I would see a comment and actually help me through the day because of it."
depression,fes5eqo,t3_eqhmlh,1579361581.0,"Hello there! Hmm... I've had insecure thoughts (just like everyone), but excessive, I would say no - so my take here is for ""regular"" insecure thoughts, I guess.

And my short answer for that is: Yes, they do fade away!

I have just replied to a thread about this, but basically, I had some insecure thoughts about myself as a person in terms of looks and personality due to the fact that I have never had a romantic relationship before. It wasn't super bad, but I really questioned a fair bit of myself due to that.

Now though? I'm not gonna lie, at times when I get down, I still do think about stuff, but it doesn't bother me anymore. I have kind of outgrown the problem. I don't preoccupy myself with the silly types of questions that I used to ask myself regarding it anymore."
depression,fes4kmq,t1_feqia0o,1579361371.0,"I just wanted to chime in here and agree about the dating site thing. I have installed Tinder before and have deleted it shortly afterwards when I saw how ""the game"" is played in there. It can be soulcrushing for a guy just to be in there.

Whilst I've never had a girlfriend, I'm gonna take my chances in the real world (as slim as they are) rather than subject myself to that, lol.

Best of luck to you OP."
depression,fes4bsp,t3_eqemq1,1579361279.0,"Hmm... I don't know if what I'm about to say might offer something of value to you, but I'm gonna go ahead and try.

I used to feel slightly similar to you. Not that strongly, but I definitely felt what you have described. I am 30 now and still have never had a girlfriend. But I'll be honest, it doesn't bother me now nearly as much as it used to bother me before. What changed? Well, my perspective about it.

You see, for the longest time, I kept thinking if there was something wrong with me. Why have I never had someone? Am I unattractive? Am I a shitty person? Don't I have game? Things like that. You can literally scratch and claw and find any sort of reason to justify why you're single (or why you're not for that matter). 

The thing is. It's just a relationship. To have a girlfriend is to just have a girlfriend. I am NOT downplaying having a meaningful relationship. But what I'm saying is that it isn't something magical that will just make all your worries away. It's not something that will fix all of these things that you are feeling. It's not the answer to your happiness. And I'm willing to bet that it's not the answer for all these jealousy feelings you have either. 

Hmm... sorry, I didn't mean for that to sound negative. What helped me was to realize that I'm not a bad person. Sure I got some mild depression. But me not having had a relationship or a girlfriend has nothing to do with my ""quality"" as a person in terms of looks or personality.

The same is true for you, whether you agree with me or not. A person's worth isn't just boiled down to how much ""game"" they have."
masseffect,feko341,t1_fek0lrr,1579204077.0,"Yep same here! My first run was on my ps3 (first generation, so graphics are... not up to par :D), so I rebought the whole trilogy on pc when it was on sale and this also caught me off guard.

I actually just accepted it as me totally forgetting it. But apparently we just plain never seen this before! haha"
CasualConversation,fek0bx0,t3_epbtbz,1579189878.0,"I'm not living in the US, but there are other places where you also get judged by it. It's a cultural and economical thing I guess. But as some posts indicate here, it is becoming more and more common for people to be living with parents as it is becoming harder and harder to gain a living independently and having your own place compared to several years ago.

It has already been said, but just live your life the best you can, you have your own journey to make, not one single life is the same. There are norms and expectations, but life never turns out to be so linear. Just do your best out there and I hope you become happy."
depression,fejz6lu,t3_epe2m7,1579189166.0,"Hello there! Thanks for posting this anecdote. I can relate to this. Maybe not on such a deep level as you do, but I do feel this.

You see, I think I have ""mild"" depression. Not the worst, but not exactly fun either. But I generally just... don't have much motivation for myself, so this is exactly how I feel regarding lots of areas in life.

Like, I do realize I have potential, be happy and be good at what I do (whatever that is), but it's just that for some reason, my stamina bar is always close to empty even when I take measures to improve it!

I don't know what to say to help you, but I just wanted to say that you have made my day less lonely. To know that someone is feeling the same way has comforted me a bit for today. Thanks for that."
tea,fdwcuya,t3_en83b7,1578757446.0,"Not answering the question for America as I don't live here, but here in France/Switzerland where I live, it is also a little bit feminized.

Drinking tea in itself is not, but most of the things surrounding it is: like the places where you can go to have tea and the stores as well are clearly for a more feminine audience.

Personally, it isn't too bothersome for me as a guy, since it isn't too over the top, and for me, I just buy the teas I like and enjoy it at my own home, so I'm not the audience anyway for these kinds of establishments. It's just kind of unfortunate I guess that it won't encourage other guys to drink tea, I suppose."
gout,fclveor,t3_ehv4np,1577757409.0,"Damn...reading these comments, this means that the attacks I have been having so far are mild ones. Believe me I am very grateful for that.

For me, my attacks aren't painful per se, but just that that part of my body becomes EXTREMELY sensitive to pain. Like even super thin bedsheets touching it will cause pain... So I would describe it as not painful but you must absolutely avoid the area that is hurting.

That said, my worst attack was when my foot toe was SO SENSITIVE that even ""wind"" makes it hurt. Thats when I resorted to powerful painkillers which helped me sleep the pain away..."
CasualConversation,fc66m56,t1_fc5y30j,1577473460.0,"Awww, but they complimented you right after they've been corrected though right?

I get it. I'm a guy who likes cooking and baking. One time I made these sweet little bread snacks and some people couldnt believe I made it and INSISTED that my mother made it. Jerks. Lol."
CasualConversation,fc66ekt,t3_egdxlz,1577473322.0,"Right there with you. It's cool that you persist on doing what you like though, I know a lot of people who are discouraged by things like this. 

Same here, I'm a guy and I like cooking and drinking tea. I know that isn't anything special depending where you live, but here, drinking tea is ""kinda feminine"" what with all the cute boxes and just a lot more women are into it than men here.

For cooking, it's better nowadays than before, but I still get the occasional ""shock"" from people when they learn that I like cooking. Some have even went so far as to not believe me, and said that it's my mother who did the cooking. Lile f*ck right off, lol."
relationship_advice,fbbsv7l,t3_ecfou2,1576707380.0,"Haha, nice going pal!

Yeah she is flirting with that line. Nobody just says that. Furthermore, the friend that talked to you afterwards? Yep, she's been eyeing you for a while lol."
