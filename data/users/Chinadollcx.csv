I remember one time in college, we did ab exercise in algebra and I completed it easily b uh t the second the professor said the next one is a test. I lost all memory of how to find the answer. But as soon as I stepped out if the room I had it."

There are a lot of times where you can't pin point your thoughts behind your feelings. I find it helpful to right things down. You dont need to show anyone or save it in the long run.

I'm going off of personal experience."
depression,fe4brg7,t3_ens27x,1578857680.0,What is going through you're head when you feel like crying? Are you thinking about things? Is your mind racing? Do you just feel down?

depression,fdey3hm,t3_el1ca8,1578349052.0,Yes! That's why I refuse to take it.
bipolar,fd9h3t0,t3_ekdbft,1578233254.0,"Im not a doctor.

I smoke marijuana everyday as much as I want and I'm on lamictal. I've never had a problem mixing the two. Lamictal is considered one of the safer drugs for bipolar. But you do have to be extremely diligent in taking it everyday because Steven Johnson's Syndrome is terrible to get. It's very rare to get SJS. Like all drugs, you could have a terrible reaction to anything.

The drug has helped very well for me."

bipolar,fb41yto,t3_ebeglo,1576499505.0,"It took several counselors and psychiatrists to diagnose me. You get the standard questions about how you feel right now, how often, when did it start, do you recognize a pattern. But then they'll usually ask more personal questions. They usually ask a brief life story. This is from my experience. I do also live in the US."
