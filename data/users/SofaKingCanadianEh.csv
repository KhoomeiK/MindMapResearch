vinyl,ff0204n,t1_fezx7ay,1579464380.0,I haven’t sunk a lot of money into my setup. It has very good sound for the price. I didn’t realize how much I would enjoy the whole experience. I will be upgrade pretty quickly starting at a turntable.

vinyl,fezls7x,t1_fezk2kx,1579458753.0,Have you bought from Discogs ? Is it hard to get a return if it’s not the condition you are expecting.
vinyl,fezky8p,t1_fezjdgl,1579458429.0,That’s what I wasn’t sure about. I’ve been buying from local record shops and thrift stores. Is there nothing rare or collectable to be found on Amazon?
vinyl,fezghit,t3_epcmkl,1579457101.0,I just ordered one for myself. I can’t wait to get it.

vancouver,fecim5z,t3_eocst8,1578974818.0,Yesterday I was working on the Port Mann Bridge resetting the chains that take the ice off the suspension cables.  All of a sudden I feel a warm smoosh on my back. I look over my shoulder to see what smooshed my back and was surprised to see a T&T bag stuck on the back of my high visibility vest. It turns out some sick bastard pooped in a bag and threw it at me.  I just want everyone to know that shitting in bags is juwong thing to do.

vancouver,fe035q5,t1_fdzzjvu,1578801903.0,I felt very lucky. I went hiking and was carrying my wallet in my backpack. When I boarded the bus I put it in my track pants pocket which doesn’t hold my wallet well. I called transit and reported that i left my wallet on the bus the previous day. I didn’t even realize I had lost  until I had to leave for work the next morning.  Transit was awesome and them giving the driver my number made it much easier for me.  They were awesome saved me the huge hassle of replacing all my cards.
vancouver,fdzudin,t1_fdwwtzl,1578796012.0,It’s exactly what happened. The driver told me that the operator before her didn’t look over the bus like they were supposed to. In those exact words. I met the driver that found it on her bus the next evening after work on route and picked up my wallet.
vancouver,fdwo8q2,t3_en0p18,1578760777.0,I left my wallet on the bus with over $ 100 cash in it.  I took the bus in the morning the next day a driver found it under the seat. Apparently it had been driven around all day without anyone seeing it. Everything was as is when I got it back. Glad you the person that found yours was a good person.

I’ve already found out the expensive this hobby is. Cleaning kits, sleeves as well as some of the vinyl I’ve paid up for. I’ve also found a cheap thrift store that I’ve had amazing luck in that has $2 albums. Seems nobody goes to this thrift store and all the others are only left with polka."
vinyl,fdg4gl8,t1_fdg3y6h,1578379651.0,Great to hear! I think I’ll just buy more vinyl for now then. I’ll enjoy the turntable I have and decide if I need an upgrade later on. Thanks.

vinyl,fdg13vn,t3_el754g,1578376194.0,So I just got a AT-LP60X record player. Now I’m already regretting not buying something better.  Is the Audio-Technica AT-LP120BK-USB Direct-Drive Professional Turntable (USB & Analog) a good player? I don’t want to have to upgrade again. It’s only $385.00 Canadian. Would I I have to spend more to get a great player? I’ve heard my player I have now can be hard on my records. Is this true? I’ve already paid up for some records and don’t want to wear them out faster with a crappy turntable. Any help in the right direction would be great thanks.

vinyl,fd7nhgy,t3_ek9bwc,1578207186.0,"$15 here but only some of yesterday’s find. A lot of  these are actually first pressings. The Elton John vinyl has amazing sound an amazing $2 find.  Best of ZZ Top could never go wrong.  BTO four wheel drive overdrive,I grew up on this stuff and find it to be an under rated album. Santana is a must have! This burton Cummings album I see quite a bit in thrift shops haven’t had a listen but he’s a Canadian legend. The police synchronicity a duplicate for me but for a $1 and it’s also a purple translucent when held to the light, first pressing. Merle haggard says goodbye to Elvis.  Dr Hook love the album and Willy because he’s awesome!!! Jefferson starship sounds great.  Mr Bojangles I haven’t had a listen yet but we all know that song. I feel like that’s a great find for $15 and is a good addition to my collection."

For the price it sounds good around $300 for my setup.I would like to start with a turntable and move up from there. I had no intention of getting into vinyl until my daughter asked for a turntable for Christmas. I bought her a slightly better AT setup with some mackies.

vinyl,fd08h0t,t3_ejs3op,1578115203.0,I bought myself a record player 10 days ago and started with one album. Lots of original 60s and 70s pressings as well as some 80s.  I’ve definitely got the bug I’ve hit all the thrift shops in my area and come up with some decent NM stuff. The dr hook album I bought for cover of the rolling stone just to find that that the album is awesome. I’ve learned a lot about records in the last 10 days I just wish I spent more on my setup.  What would you all suggest for a great sounding turntable without completely breaking the bank?

I feel a little pissed that the guy that owns the record store could let this fly. If I just started to collect and I already noticed something is off this shouldn’t be on his shelf at that price. The red label Atlantic are sought out here as a great sounding first Canadian press. Thanks again I really needed the help because I’m only 5 days into collecting. I’ve got a whole bunch of cool stuff to go through.
vinyl,fcmz7kf,t1_fcmxtin,1577798418.0,Both of you thanks.
vinyl,fcmz6l0,t1_fcmxw3m,1577798390.0,Wow Ive been searching the whole internet for hours. I knew something wasn’t right the colour the “LY”  I played both quietly because I’m in apartment the canadian Atlantic sounds so much better and it’s in worse shape. I was going to wait until morning and crank it and really find out which was better. Now I I’ll just take it back with my real copy and both of your investigation and show him it’s a dud! He had another copy I’ll have to check that one too. The cover seems exactly like mine. Hmmmmm I hope he didn’t try to screw me on purpose.

vinyl,fcmwot7,t1_fcmv9rb,1577795663.0,Thanks for your time and info. I would agree that what you say sounds very logical and seems to be what happened in this case. I also take Discogs with a grain of salt pricing included. Now I guess it’s up to me to find out if it’s worth my $60 or take it back to my record shop.
vinyl,fcmvtu8,t1_fcmumai,1577794613.0,"Thank you! A few days ago I bought a record player. Now I find out not all records are created equal. There is so much to know. Matrix’s codes and etching are always changing. It’s complicated and I’m trying to crack it’s code.  
What are your thoughts would you think it is the same pressing as the other Canadian Atlantic red label pressing? I guess it would help more if had more of an understanding of the whole pressing process. Anyway I think it’s safe to say collecting already has its grasp on me."
vinyl,fcmtnft,t1_fcmp7q2,1577791710.0,Sounds like you could be right but I have yet to find another that looks the same as the one on the right. Tomorrow I’ll have to crank them both up and see which on sounds better.
vinyl,fcms6i4,t1_fcmp7q2,1577789629.0,From what I’ve read and heard the first pressing Atlantic Canadian red label is sought out for.  For sure here in Canada they’re pretty rare. Some say they’re second to Ludwig in sound but that’s only what I’ve read.  Maybe not a fake but I bought it as a Canadian red label first press. I paid $60 and they go for $60 to $80 for a red label. The “LY” seem to all have a green & red label.  Im reading  “LY” is Atlantic’s code for Shelley product . I’m new to collecting vinyl and trying to figure out what I have. Did I pay too much? Should I bring it back to my record store?
vinyl,fcmk9ym,t3_ehzucp,1577778745.0,Ok so I’m a new collector. I got some records from my mother.  I found a first press Canadian red label Led Zeppelin III the one on the left is from my mothers collection. I bought another the one on the right for my daughter for $60.  I just noticed o e is darker and the label is printed different as well the number are inscribed with a different font on the centre ring of the vinyl. All the pictures online that I have found of a Canadian first press match my mother Zeppelin III. I can’t find one like the other do I have a fake? I know my mothers has been sitting in a box for 30 years.
