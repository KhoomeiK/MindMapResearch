I had a 200watt system that kept all my devices charged and also allowed me to reheat food with convenience.  


There are little [12v ceramic heating panels](https://www.amazon.com/Akozon-Heating-Electric-Insulated-Thermostatic/dp/B07YV4C773/ref=sr_1_26?keywords=12v+ceramic+heater&qid=1578602863&s=automotive&sr=1-26) that you can rig up with a 12v blower   but I havent tried because personally, I am willing to wear a ski mask in my house so I am of the mind that blankets and sweaters are a more affordable option than adjusting ambient temperature in the space.  


 If you want a significant temperature differential then look at these forced air [diesel heaters](https://www.amazon.com/Parking-Thermostat-Caravans-Campervans-Silencer/dp/B07W66KXR8/ref=asc_df_B07W66KXR8/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=398540768796&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11693255467033949548&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028841&hvtargid=pla-851768415824&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=92996539388&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=398540768796&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11693255467033949548&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028841&hvtargid=pla-851768415824) from china. apparently they work quite well, but I have never gone further north than Colorado so I never developed a heating system for my van.   


If you will be in an area with mostly concrete then go with the hydrocarbon route. But I also looked at these nifty [wood burning stoves for RV](https://cubicminiwoodstoves.com/collections/all/products/cb-1008-br-cubic-mini-wood-stove) if I ever decided to go up to Canada. The small unit would absolutely heat any van beyond comfortable temperatures and you will also be able to cook on it. You could use wood pellets or even firewood to power it.

I was working as a solar installation tech and having my van on site was AMAZING being able to go and cook my lunch during break. So if you have a job where you can park on site for extended periods of time, #vanlife is amazing.  


Look into a gym membership where you can shower or even just get a large ABS water tank to wash your feet and crevices before you go to bed and it is very manageable and comfortable. Like you said all of these things are VERY affordable when you arent dumping your money into a a black hole--if you have a reliable sourcve of income. People who can make money off of a laptop like graphic designers have it made for vanlife.  


For people who don't like camping and are actively building a career/business rent becomes a worthy investment. But literally hundreds of dollars in disposable income if you have solid and RELIABLE cash flow sources is available if you are okay with the ""camping"" lifestyle.  


The common pitfalls people come upon is thinking ""WOW i can live/park where ever for FREE.""  


You have to have reliable places to park or you will be having horrible sleep and stressing constantly. If you have a job site you can park at or even pay to park at an RV park, then you are good if you don't mind not having a personal plumbing system 24/7.  


Personally, if I am in a safe place where I know no one will be breaking into my shit or a neighbor calling the cops to pound on my window, I sleep like a baby in my van. And therefore, spending hundreds of dollars every month on my own toilet, shower, and living room is lame to me since I have a high discount rate on these comforts.  I would rather live in a van for a decade and then OWN my own property with comfort rather than pay someone else's mortgage just so I can have a hot shower 24/7. I like to exercise, so not having a living room to stretch and stand up in is a bit of a hamper on living. But i can always stretch out on my bed to decompress my spine.  


Look into parking situations is the biggest advice I can say because the POTENTIAL to having your shit pounded on is a stress even if it never happens. Most people can go a few days without a sophisticated plumbing situation. I bought a porto-toilet from walmart and shat in it in my van and it didn't even feel strange at all.
