When upshifting, most MT drivers are probably rev matching unintentionally, because during the upshift, the RPM drops naturally.

But for downshifting, most MT drivers are not rev matching. You would have to blip the accelerator while downshifting. And not only that, you should be blipping in neutral with clutch UP. (Technique is called double slutch). There is no way a MT driver would naturally do this without being trained (or learn it).
