I’m not a fan of big headed people, it’s the other characters not giving him an ounce of recognition on it that makes it worse. He can save the day and do the most awesome looking stunts, and everyone for the most part still face palms at him :)"

My partner thinks the dialogue is funny but doesn’t like the animation style, and that’s enough for him to give it a miss. For me, it’s one of my top shows and I really recommend it if you like ridiculous humour and “in jokes”."
Dogtraining,ffhrcld,t1_ffglz5e,1579949852.0,I’m so glad! I think it’s one of the easiest things to implement that helps. She’s lucky to have you <3

dogs,ff8mpe6,t3_es3qbm,1579686211.0,"Look at how cute and fluffy your shiba is!! I’m in love seriously. 

I’m also really happy to hear of your success, I’m proud of him too but I’m also proud of YOU! You did this, he was a super brave boy yes but without your time and patience he’d not of recovered so celebrate that achievement! 

My little boy also hates his nails clipped, and I’m a huge coward when it comes to potentially hurting him (he has black nails too, yay) but luckily my vet has the magic touch and he will let him do it. Absolutely fine with me he can have the panic attack! 

Also the recommendations for training tools were v appreciated, thanks :)"

TvShows,ff67yir,t3_erw7zq,1579621274.0,"Watch the Warcraft movie in 4K! 

Life of Pi was a good one to watch to gauge the actual improvements. 

Kubo and the two strings, 

The Dark Knight Returns, I think would be good to watch even just for the opening scene (I’m not sure it’s technically 4K but I remember something special about it, the last two movies are just movies I -know- to be visually spectacular.) 


TV shows I’m not great with recommendations because I’m one of those awful people who just binge watch crime/thriller series and they ain’t known for their graphics! But I hope the movies helped.

Edit; made the format a bit more readable a bit less wall of text!"
