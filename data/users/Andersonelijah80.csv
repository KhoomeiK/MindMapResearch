Judaism,ff7eh20,t1_ff7bkca,1579647674.0,"Manichaeanism was a religion/philosophy that mixed Christianity with Gnosticism (heavy on the Gnosticism) and a few other religions. It was dualistic, teaching a fight between good and evil. it spread as far as China, but died out after a while.

The famous Christian theologian, Augustine of Hippo, was a Manichaean for many years before converting to Christianity."

Judaism,feybgde,t1_fewgid6,1579443258.0,"Speaking as someone studying to be a Christian theologian, I frequently use Talmudic material, and intend to use Rashi and Rambam frequently. When I was studying in Jerusalem, I studied Hebrew and comparative Semitics with a Rabbi. I often use my JPS Tanakh when studying Hebrew.

On the other side, the Rabbi I studied with studied Paul and Jesus to get an understanding for 1st century Jewish thought (i.e. understanding Jewish debate not discussed in the Mishna, e.g. debates between Hillel and Shammai). And I know that many Jewish theologians use Christian material, especially in the realm of academia. One example would be the Jewish use of text criticism, which makes use of the documentary hypothesis, initially developed (in my opinion, poorly) by Julius Wellhausen.

There is also frequent collaboration between Jews and Christians in the realm of linguistics; especially with regards to DSS and LXX materials. And in the IAA there are a wide variety of Jewish and Christian scholars alike that work together."
Judaism,fewbyvy,t1_few3suj,1579408147.0,Bad theologians perhaps. Bad Jewish theologians too
Judaism,few10j8,t3_eqpu8o,1579403942.0,"If you think this is what Christians say, you don’t know Christian theology. Christian and Jewish theologians often use each other’s material for study, linguistic and otherwise."

ReformedHumor,fdskba3,t1_fdscdfo,1578704250.0,"Okay, so I’m not an expert by any stretch, but here are a few works which may be of some help, not only from the reformation but also pre-reformation:

Pre-Reformation:
Radbertus’ and Ratramnus’ works on the Lord’s Supper

Reformation
“A Clear and Simple Treatise on the Lord’s Supper” by Theodore Beza


Book 4, Ch. 14, 17-19 of [Calvin’s Institutes](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes/institutes.vi.xv.html) 


[Confession and the Lord’s Supper](http://reverendluther.org/pdfs2/Luther-Confession-LordSupper.pdf) by Luther


[the Babylonian Captivity of the Church by Luther](http://pdf.amazingdiscoveries.org/eBooks/BABYLONIAN_CAPTIVITY_OF_THE_CHURCH.pdf) 


Honestly these are just a few of the titles. If you need more hit me up and I can throw some more obscure ones your way. Also check out some of Zwingli’s works; Him, Luther, and Calvin form the three main Protestant views. 
[Berkhof](https://downloads.biblicaltraining.org/Systematic%20Theology%20by%20Louis%20Berkhof.pdf)  gives a good summary of the views in his “Systematic Theology” which is only about 10 pages long, if you’re looking for a good place to start."
ReformedHumor,fdsbhuc,t1_fds1pap,1578698789.0,Check out a few reformers; there’s a lot of good discussion on it.
MemriTVmemes,fdn05jz,t1_fdkeca6,1578573110.0,"Yeah, it was actually a pretty big conspiracy theory; lots of republicans believed it and Trump joked about it.  
while I think it’s a load of crap, the whole “birth certificate“ thing is weird.
