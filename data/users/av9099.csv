A ground is solely for football."

I guess Harry thought the same many, many times. When he got to know his parents died, and how, and why. When he was mocked and stared at by everyone in his first years of school. When the ministry called him a liar. When he realised that Lord Voldemort is alive and wants to kill him - and he is a 14 year old against a master of the dark arts. When Sirius died. ...

Did he ever give up? 

I think you know: You owe it to him to follow his story through until the very end."

harrypotter,fej68u2,t1_fei5t10,1579158586.0,"Okay I think I see what you mean, especially your last sentence. I agree with you on that part.   
Not on the _unquestionably devoted_. But that depends on the perception of the reader, I guess."
harrypotter,fei03ia,t1_fehbxya,1579127386.0,"Luna was all about Harry? What makes you think that? I never had that feeling, at all.    
     
And in the end, it most go both ways. Harry never seemed to have anything for her.  
I really like her, she's one of my favourite characters. In my opinion some of her views and behaviour is very mature for her age.     
Sometimes, or most of the time, too mature for 13...16 year olds."

The no 20 comment was funny tho, haha"
AskReddit,fd1uwzf,t1_fd1ua5k,1578137202.0,"Me too. Most of the time it's not even necessary for the plot. It was just the way how books were written in that time. That's at least my assumption.    
If I'm not in the mood for that I skip some lines. If I have the feeling I missed something, I can go back and read it."

I agree on your other points, though :)   
Stores closed on Sunday is doubled edged in my opinion. It certainly is a convenience. On the other hand: Who'd like to work on a Sunday?"
chelseafc,fctwdmm,t1_fcsiddd,1577962932.0,"I don't think a classic #10 like Sneijder 10 years ago is what players will be trying to become in the next years.   
That said, I didn't say ""easily improved"".    
For the system Lampard wants to play at the moment Mount is apparently the best option right now.   
So I support Mount in getting better and honestly think he has the potential to actually become a better player."
chelseafc,fcrew49,t1_fcqz97g,1577900902.0,"If he keeps playing Mount that's the fastest way for him to get better. He can become one of the best in 2, 3 years."

Because his father was a jew, he had to stop working at his own, co-owned, store. The (non jew) female co-owner split the earnings nonetheless.   
As the time came were Jews had to hide because of the Gestapo, she send the family of Michael Degen to some friends.   
The three daughters (around 17 to 25) worked in their own home as prostitutes.   
   
Michael Degen, aged around 6 then, slept with his mother in the same room.    
   
It's literally unbelievable what humans had to endure during this time."
