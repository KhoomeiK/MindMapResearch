marvelstudios,fgnzxbw,t1_fgnnl03,1580956611.0,i might be remembering wrong but wasn’t that apparently a reference to agents of shield? (i remember reading somewhere one of the scientists o. the show creating that but i didn’t watch the show)
UTAustinAdmissions,fgnhgwb,t1_fgkmb59,1580944973.0,"I don’t really know too much about single dorms but from what I heard there are very few of them and they go extremely fast, so you’re probably out of luck there. If you still end up going with the dorms and don’t want to room with a complete stranger I’d recommend you join the class of ‘24 Facebook group ASAP. There will be people posting on there with bios about themselves asking if anyone wants to room with them. It’s at least better than the random process where you basically only know their major and some things about them (like how messy, time they go to sleep etc.). I got a random roomate this year and she’s nice but she’s really loud and snores a lot, and she’s not a good communicator, so I wish I had gone the Facebook route."

UTAustinAdmissions,fghixxe,t3_eyi6w5,1580785861.0,"From my experience most live in the Duren/Kins area because most of the engineering buildings and the general Cockrell area is like a 5 min walk from there (also Kinsolving food is way better than J2 which is the Jester dining hall). That being said there is still a good number of Engineering people in Jester and the other dorms, but you’ll probably have to walk more."

Austin,ffygca4,t3_evto1c,1580345755.0,"Probably a bit out of your way but if you ever end up near Pflugerville or end up making the drive (I think it’s generally around 30 min from Hyde Park area though idk about traffic) West Pecan Coffee + Beer is really nice, especially at night! They have live music pretty often. I’m not really a fan of their coffee but their hot chocolate is good, and they get their baked goods from a local bakery which is good. They also have a lot of board games and they have a book shelf and do a “take a book leave a book” thing which is cool. I’d recommend checking out their facebook page or website if your interested. They also have different food trucks come by on certain days, I try to go whenever Waffle Love is there!"

unpopularkpopopinions,ffx2dak,t1_ffx0ncp,1580316267.0,"Yes there are many english speaking member in NCT, however a lot of the 127 members who didn’t know english before debut have actually made shocking strides in their skills. Look at some of the SuperM concert ments, Taeyong is miles above the other non english speaking members. Honestly imo he’s pretty close to being fluent, his english is really good. A lot of the other 127 members are getting really good too!"
unpopularkpopopinions,ffx1pdw,t3_evid3m,1580315862.0,"probably could’ve been worded better but I kinda agree. I mean Spanish is the second most spoken language in the US and Spanish music has only really just began to take off here (as in being played on the mainstream radio channels and on big TV shows and stuff). I don’t know about never, but I don’t think Kpop will be mainstream for a really, really long time."

there’s some others too, but i’m guessing the first one is your best bet since it has the most members."
UTAustin,ffmmgi7,t1_ffmda97,1580056676.0,you can join the UT Austin class of 2024 Facebook page. Theres always a ton of people posting on there looking for a roomate. You could respond to one of those or post your own.

UTAustin,ffiip3b,t3_etc5a6,1579974807.0,"honestly i would start asap. id recommend at least starting it before school ends for you, cause once school ends you won’t want to do anything and you’ll put it off until the very last minute. I can’t speak for how hard it is (I was stupid and bought it before realizing I didn’t actually need to do it). I did the first couple of modules and they were easy but some of my friends who had to do it (given they put it off for the last minute) said the whole was really stressful so just be weary and give yourself enough time!"
UTAustin,ffihsw0,t1_ffi3mb9,1579974197.0,I’m also a freshman and I live in the dorms with a random roomate. Honestly my roomate is driving me crazy. Maybe if it’s someone you know that you’re dorming with it’s fine but I really wish I’d had my own room. Dining halls are a plus though.
unpopularkpopopinions,ffibg9n,t3_etmsrw,1579969885.0,"Legendary groups like APink, AOA, B2ST, 4Minute, Kara, T-ara, After School, Infinite, FTisland, Brown Eyed Girls, CNBlue, Sistar,SS501 etc. all came from smaller companies and were extremely popular. I don’t know if the people who spread this narrative that the big 3 completely obliterated any and all competition until suddenly BTS came in stopped them are newer to the kpop scene or what but it’s not at all true. There were many successful groups from outside of the big 3."
kpop,ffhb3ns,t1_ffhalan,1579928484.0,I thought Suho got to postpone a year cause there’s some education thingy in Korea that allows men to postpone enlistment?
kpop,ffh76v5,t1_ffh337k,1579925033.0,"I think there’s a pretty good chance, a lot of those stock/financial analysts mentioned it in their reports. Even if SM wasn’t planning on it, Wendy’s injury has probably expedited the need for a NGG as RV will probably be out of commission (besides tours and other already scheduled events) until Wendy heals. Majority of EXO will be in the army by the end of the year as well, so they’ll probably need something new to keep their name in the news cycle. What Im really interested in seeing is if they also debut a boy group, as some analysts have been saying. I wanna know what a normal 4th gen SM boy group looks like (don’t get me wrong I love my NCT boys but I’m curious about a SMBG that’s not infinite members)"

I also really like Pugh in general and I can't wait to see her in Black Widow, but honestly if someone told me she was in her early 30s the first time I saw her I'd probably believe them. Seeing her younger Amy portrayal just felt super weird, like a grown woman throwing a temper tantrum."

I had 2 history books to read last semester and they were so boring I could barely make it through a page without feeling like giving up. Having an audiobook going at the same time would kinda force me to keep my eyes on the book, though it sounds kinda expensive."
