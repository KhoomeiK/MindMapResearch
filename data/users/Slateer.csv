Caitlynmains,ffb1sg8,t1_ffb0eg2,1579749648.0,"I see where you're coming from. And while I agree that bot lane is very all-in heavy right now with Leona/Naut, with proper lane management you can still pressure lane while avoiding all ins. Wave management is the most important aspect of laning phase. I willingly take Vayne match ups into Caitlyn players because I know I can go even with wave management alone. 

A big reason why MF, Varus and Lucian are seeing play at the highest level of play is because they are strong early. And, as you said, much better at all-in than Caitlyn in. But in comparison, none of those champions can push lane as freely as Caitlyn can to roam for drag, get vision or invade without going oom. Leona is just broken and there is pretty much not a single ADC that can freely auto outside of her engagement range and die or blow summs. Naut on the other hand is much easier to deal with. 

While I understand why you think Kai'sa and Xayah are better in an all in meta, they are considerably weaker early and will not match Caitlyn's strength until much later in the game unless they manage to snag kills. As oppose to Lucian or MF that can match Caitlyn almost the entirety of the game."
Caitlynmains,ffayk5z,t1_ffax2ox,1579747471.0,"Alright, well as you said, this conversation is devolving into something off topic. So I'll answer your first question. Why is Caitlyn stronger than Kai'sa and Xayah?

Early laning phase. Honestly, that's my simple answer. With the increased importance on Drake, one of the easiest ways to snowball is to get Dragon Soul. And the best way to secure Drake is bot lane pressure. I think this is a perfect meta for Caitlyn considering the more bot lane centric gameplay and what she offers to it. I think Textbook Caitlyn play (Win bot, get tower, rotate and take everything on the map) is the freest win you can get playing ADC. And it has been for months.

You're focusing too much on kit strength. Do Kai'sa and Xayah have a stronger kit than Caitlyn? Undeniably. But the same can be said for MF or Jhin. Does Kai'sa have a much stronger kit than MF? Well, of course. Is she stronger at this moment? No."
Caitlynmains,ffatxjh,t1_ffaqr37,1579744409.0,"Kog'Maw....high range sniper....nice joke. Even with the Machine Gun of his W he was never a sniper because it barely increased his range (if it did at all). 

And if your logic is ""the end result is the same, a person clicks on your and you die"" then that can easily be applied to any champion in the game. And since you said Annie into Akali is a bad example, what about Akali and Diana? They both press Q, E, R to delete someone and are both AP assassins that were reworked recently. Both are busted. But one only needs a numbers nerf and the other has been having her kit gutted nearly since release. Why? If the end result of them pressing buttons to kill you is the same, why not hard gut both kits?"
Caitlynmains,ffat9m1,t1_ffaq3y0,1579743968.0,"> Stick to a tier list.


Unfortunately, 9.19 tier list is no longer available on U.GG. Pro guides and U.GG however always agree on one thing: S+ tier champions. I have never seen variance in those two sources when it comes to the absolute strongest champions in the meta. I'm a bit of a meta slave as well, believe me, Kai'sa was S+ during that time.

> Are we talking Masters+ or Pro Play?

I was clearly talking about Pro Play which is a much much higher level than Masters....lol. At the highest level Kai'sa is not stronger than MF, Senna, Aphelios, Caitlyn even Varus. I would take Pro Play into account to determine whether a champion is strong before I would take Solo Queue. 

> In pro play it's a spam of Kai'sa 

There has only been a single Kai'sa pick in the LPL. The same as Kindred and Gragas ADC. Lucian and Varus haven't been here and there champions, they are picked much much more than Kai'sa is. And Caitlyn and Xayah have more presence in bans than Kai'sa (though neither have huge P/B presence, so that's not saying much). 

> After a certain level Proguides tier list aren't relevant anymore

I'm glad you feel that way. So you must not think Proguides is relevant in this conversation. U.GG says Kai'sa is D Tier in Masters+ and Caitlyn is C tier. Still stronger. 

> Akali has a bad winrate but is still absolutely busted.

The difference is that Akali is D tier in Platinum+ and S+ in Masters+. Akali's winrate at Platinum+ is 46. But since you are fixated on Masters+, her winrate at high elo is 51. 

In comparison to Kai'sa who is D tier is every single elo she is played in and maintains a winrate around 48 percent. Kai'sa doesnt scale from bad to good based on player skill like Akali does. Kai'sa is just bad all around. And she only recieves play due to her overloaded kit and general popularity. But there is no evidence to suggest she is in the slightest bit strong. Certainly not stronger than Caitlyn. If a single pick in pro play means Kai'sa is stronger then Kindred and Gragas must be stronger ADCs as well."
Caitlynmains,ffans0m,t1_ffamq5a,1579740286.0,"That is not true, Kai'sa and Xayah were both S tier at that time.

https://youtu.be/4xrGS0zXmbk

> Patch 9.19, Kai'sa S+ and Xayah S tier. The Worlds Patch

So no, Kai'sa wasn't meta when she was D Tier. She is D Tier now and not a single pro team has picked her. Caitlyn has a bigger P/B presence than Kai'sa and Xayah right now. Hm, wonder why. Is it because.....she's stronger?

If you want to blissfully ignore Tier lists (which exists for a reason) then surely you can't ignore solo queue winrate, or presence in Pick/Ban at the highest level of play. Skill ceiling be damned, Caitlyn is much stronger than Xayah or Kai'sa. Vayne has a higher skill ceiling than Senna but guess who is stronger right now?"
Caitlynmains,ffamqeq,t1_ffajjn5,1579739578.0,"You're not disliked because you're on Reddit or you have a different opinion. You're disliked because you are wrong. You simplify Caitlyn's mechanics to Kog'Maw by saying ""it's just right clicking"". Which is incredibly stupid. That's like saying Annie is equal to Akali mechanically because they both press Q and R to delete somebody. Same input sure, wildly different levels of skill impression.

Not only is your comparison stupid, but it's also wrong. Machine Gun Kog'Maw simply presses W and can Right Click once. Machine Gun Caitlyn first has to place a trap (W), get a stun, net (E), Q and rapidly right click to the side of the champion three times to get the full effect of the combo. Which becomes extremely hard if there are other people around.

And he held his own against Caps at RR last year. He had a nice cs lead and was winning trades in lane. But TSM kinda fell apart that game.

Granted, trading a turrent plate for drag is the worse play most of the time. But that's the only valid part of your complaint imo.

Often times the enemy bot lane will back and I will use the rest of my mana to shove and base myself. And then, as I'm oom, the jungle pings drag despite their bot lane heading back to lane and their jungle still up. And I never take that risk, not only will I be oom, I will be at a huge item disadvantage. And people get mad at bot lane for not taking the risk (or fucking up our lane due to how long it will take to do drag) because they want to take drag when its most disadvantageous for you.  

People who get mad at bot lane players for not risking getting collapsed on when they can't win or putting themselves behind are probably not familiar with how bot lane works. Its usually only low elo junglers because higher elo junglers understand laning dynamics better. Drag isn't worth suiciding over early game. Or ruining your lane.

pokemon,fdo452z,t3_emafi8,1578598554.0,"It looks great. The sad thing is that you have to pay for it, and even with all they showed, I can't be sure it's worth the asking price. I like that there will be no thord version. But $30? That's the price of Platinum or BW2. Are we getting Platinum/HGSS amounts of content for the same price? 

Also it sucks that Pokemon is just now getting on the DLC train where most games are going the free DLC route such as Battlefield and even COD. Imagine Sword/Shield getting long term free DLC expansion. It's already the shortest game in the series, that would absolutely be an amazing turnaround and would make less feature packed games on release more acceptable. 

Gotta squeeze them dollars though."

Old Logic is around A tier, not the best, but well above mid."
lolesports,fcvrkxv,t3_eiwgxj,1578008508.0,"This poll was super hard honestly. Especially for Top and Jungle. Top 5 in those roles are pretty stacked. For every other role....meh...

You gotta put Doubelift as the number one ADC because he's Doubelift. I'm surprised Bang is rated as Top 3 considering his play for the vast majority of 2019 was uninspiring. And especially since they is a lot of talks about imports playing in NA for a check. Bang should definitely not be given the benefit of the doubt. At least Piglet was the best ADC in NA the first year he came.

Who we should give the benefit of the doubt to however is Jensen and Bjergsen as top two again. Xmithe and Jensen were known to not have anything special synergy wise and Jensen was still Top 3 in NA. With another Dane in Broxah, who for sure knows how to play around mid, and a Jensen that should be hungry after world's you have to expect Jensen to be Top 2 again. 

Same with Bjergsen. People all too easily forget how big the gap was between Bjerg and every other mid was in Spring when TSM was stable. The gap between Bjerg and everyone else was so big that him being the best wasn't even arugably anymore. And that was with Akaadian who was Top 3 but still noticably behind Sven and Xmithe. His play fell in Summer, but TSM basically imploded. He had to play with three jinglers. All of which were below average. The whole team suffered, not just him. Now he is playing with potentially the best NA jungle in Darodch and should have a stable, healthy environment again. You gotta be crazy if you think we see another Summer 19 Bjergsen performance before we see another Spring 19 level performance. 

Also, Nisqy played with the best jungle in NA last split. I put him at 4th behind Crown, Jensen and  Bjergsen. They all showed much higher ceilings than he did last year and they all upgraded their Junglers. Whereas Nisqy downgraded. He's not better than any of the other three invidually and now he won't have the best jungler in the league making up for his weak early game."
lolesports,fcvpw7b,t1_fcup3pw,1578007425.0,"Bjergsen haters are a weird bunch. They do anything they can to discredit him, including lying and not using their eyes. He had his worst split in Spring and was at worst Top 4. While the entire team was mental boom. I guess everyone ignores how hard he shitted on the league when TSM was a better environment in Spring."
summonerschool,fcvf011,t1_fcvazc4,1578000711.0,"Thank you! Yeah I do generally tend to play more passively even when I have huge leads due since I don't know when the enemy jungle will come to deal my bounty. 

Thank you very much, that could be a game changer for me. When I was Plat I used to routinely invade blueside jungle with or sometimes without my jungle (if I knew I could get out). I really appreciate it, I'll start working on my vision control."
summonerschool,fcv9aea,t1_fcv8v6v,1577997318.0,"Probably like.....aggresiveness. I play really standard and build up leads in a more standard way. I capitalize on mistakes but Diamond Smurfs probably would force their opponents to make mistakes with pressure. I just don't like to feed (which is why my KDAs are so good). But maybe it's something J should change. 

So how should I be pressuring more with my lead?"

summonerschool,fcv2epn,t1_fcv1mh0,1577993235.0,"The thing is, I can't ask about specifics because I don't know what specifics to ask about. All I can do is do VOD review and notice little mistakes. But the reason I focused on my stats so much is because it's showing that by all accounts I should be well above my elo. But I'm not. 

So yeah. Some general tips of things I might not have been aware of would have been appreciated. Again, I can't go into what kind of super specific things it is that I think I'm bad at, because outside of warding (which I did say) I'm not sure what specifics concept it is that I'm failing at. In this case general advice would have helped me more than something like ""when do I rotate as ADC"" because I don't know for sure if rotations are or aren't my problem. 

On top of this I suggested that my micro us fine but most like my macro must be lacking in some sort. That, along with my op.gg would give people a chance to see whether my macro was lacking. As one person was able to determine somewhat by looking at my gold generation stats and saying I'm making advantges for myself but not for my team."
okbuddyretard,fcv0e90,t3_eiwte3,1577992099.0,Any serious answer as to what's going on?
summonerschool,fcv08w1,t1_fcuzywq,1577992014.0,"You got to be joking. I wrote all those paragraphs giving very specific details, examples and statistics and you take the post down because I linked my op.gg at the very end? And then claim I didn't compliment with details? When I posted a video of one of my gameplay moments?"
summonerschool,fcux86a,t1_fcuw336,1577990349.0,"My team fighting is the best aspect of my play actually. But there are times where I am not there for a fight. Mostly because my team will engage at an incredibly stupid time when they know they have a numbers disadvantage. And I have good map awareness so I know it's not my team getting engaged on, but rather them willingly taking a 5v3 or 5v4. 

I'm not sure what to do in that case. Because I'm playing the map properly. I know when to catch waves, base and group. On average I have less than 5 deaths in every champion. But in Gold solo laners with TP don't split. They just engage mindlessly over and over again. It feels like I have to actually be a bad player to win instead of being a smart one."
summonerschool,fcuoc5f,t1_fcunmzo,1577985240.0,"I'm only playing so many random adcs because I'm trying to learn during preseason. But Last season I stuck mostly to Ashe, Vayne and Caitlyn as my main three and it still didn't work. And even with the wide champ pool I'm crushing it individually and have a 50+ percent winrate on almost all on them.

Maybe it would better of I posted a vod instead? Because even macro wise my stats are above average (objectives etc). So I don't think numbers tell the full story here.

Also thanks for the build advice. I hate the Kai'sa tear build anyway tbh."

If he misinterpreted the title and made an assumption that's on him.
