patientgamers,ff9s73b,t1_ff8mpfe,1579720052.0,Avalanche on the GC was good but veered a bit SSX for my tastes. Still had that brilliantly tactile snow though.
patientgamers,ff43vdh,t3_erguxr,1579554963.0,Condemned 1 and 2? More deliberate than the games you mentioned but the melee combat (which revolves around found items like rebar and 2x4 boards) is excellent.
listentothis,ff2sq2z,t3_er04ws,1579522529.0,Whoah! This gave me goosebumps.
patientgamers,feu0vpo,t3_eq6bqu,1579382039.0,"Ring of Red on PS2. It's clunky, gritty mech combat in an alternate Cold War where Russia is at war with Japan. You move your mechs on a turn-based map but encounters play out real-time. You have foot soldiers with upgradeable skills and loads of different customisation options. It's brilliant but unknown."
WTF,fer42gp,t1_fepcm27,1579349536.0,Because that's where all the cops are? At the station. Just waiting for your call.
cringe,femauut,t1_feft380,1579246449.0,"You're making a lot of assumptions as to why people work service jobs (for instance) and glossing over the realities of social inequalities. The physicist working McDonald's isn't choosing the 'low stress' nature of the job, they're acting out of desperation.

Eliminating those jobs doesn't lead to the less intelligent dropping out, it results in the less well-connected dropping out.

And it gets worse. Because say, for instance, all the physical labour becomes automated. Now all your hyper intelligent service workers are going for programming jobs (let's say). Which means those jobs drop in value because the supply outweighs the demand. And so it goes. 

The trend you're describing is not towards greater enfranchisement of the intelligent, it is towards greater disenfranchisement of everybody except the already financially and socially secure.

You can already see this process in, as an example, the advertising industry. Advertising used to be a route whereby those who were low in economic capital could leverage their cultural capital (including their education) to get ahead. Now, however, the industry has become very bourgeois because only people with money behind them can endure the unpaid internships and the frequent periods of unemployment.

Those who can't rely on preexisting financial support have to take shitty jobs. Many will never make it out.

That's not Darwin at work, that's Marx."

cringe,fedo5m3,t1_fecyvf1,1579016223.0,"If the 50 more intelligent workers can easily find another job, why are they mowing lawns?

It's more likely that they can't find another job. So they have to take the work that's available. Eliminate that work and now they can't earn any income."
cringe,fecxm7r,t1_fecv3ek,1578988748.0,"Kind of my point. Eliminating service jobs doesn't equate to rewarding the intelligent, but publishing the poor."
cringe,fectf5z,t1_fecqhhl,1578983909.0,Because it's only people of low intelligence who work service jobs.

NPD,fdgmgc3,t3_el1eqy,1578402235.0,"Two things helped me, they may help you.

One was a practical exercise. I started keeping a diary addressed to myself one year in the future. I assumed that future me was in a much happier place. Turned out, they were.

Two was an outlook. Look at a map. Find your hometown. Then realise you're just a spot on that dot on the map. Then consider the size of your country, continent, the earth, the solar system, the galaxy, the universe. Then consider that all of homo sapien history is only about 11500 years long and 99.999999% of it is irrelevant dust. You can't succeed enough to beat space and time, and you can't fuck up enough for it to ever really matter. So you're free to just live."

Android,fcg50y7,t1_fcg267t,1577636524.0,"That's true. But because you can't anticipate what might be criminalised, the better option is to act casual rather than dropping out (in my opinion, obviously). Our inevitable fascist overlords are more likely to mistrust those without blemish than to genuinely seek to eliminate everyone with a particular stigma. Authoritarianism is all about control. Give them something to make them think they have you if they want you, but not anything that makes them want you in the first place.

Or that's what I tell myself rather than crying into my pillow."

facepalm,fceita8,t1_fc8pjmv,1577620873.0,Well good luck. I hope the future is better for you than the past. And please don't let random Internet arseholes like me bring you down.
NPD,fcego0a,t1_fce58mu,1577620286.0,"Not an NPD sufferer: OP is right. This is a forum for people seeking help and community to deal with a difficult, poorly-understood condition.

I lurk here because seeing the genuine thoughts of people with NPD helps me understand what they are going through and what their relationships mean to them. There isn't, since r/narcissism became an adjunct to r/npdabuse or whatever, any other forum where I can gain this insight. More crucially, there isn't anywhere else for people with NPD to get support from fellow travellers.

You've come in to, as OP has pointed out, muse - pointlessly - on why NPD sufferers appear to lack empathy. Like, d'uh. You haven't been respectful. There's nothing in your post which isn't a dig at people you actually don't know. Also, your non-apology ('I'm sorry you feel that way') doesn't at all express any empathy on your part.

Finally, this is very clearly and specifically a forum for people with NPD. It says as much in the info for the sub. I'm chuffed i get to lurk, and I would hate this community to disappear because it becomes flooded with comments and posts by people with axes to grind. There are plenty of places to do that already.

Mods, sorry for interrupting. I will resume silent lurking immediately.

OP, good luck. We can't change the past but we can all aim to make a better future."
facepalm,fc8nnsk,t1_fc8l6nr,1577538611.0,"First off, i agree I shouldn't have gotten personal, even if your tone annoyed me. That's on me, not you and I'm sorry for being a mean-spirited prick. 

On the other hand, don't lob *virgin* as an insult if you are a virgin. You're only insulting yourself.

Finally, and of course you can ignore this or not, but I assure you it's well-intentioned: in a recent study, the single quality people most desired in a partner was kindness. This is especially true of people your age, who in general are more altruistic, more civic-minded, and more compassionate than previous generations. Work on developing those qualities in yourself and you might find that your weight is not the factor you think it is. 

Anyway, good luck, fellow argumentative Internet stranger. I am obviously embarked on the same, lifelong journey to be a slightly better person than i was ten minutes ago."
