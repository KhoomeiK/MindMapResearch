Got pulled over the instant I pulled onto the highway from my driveway at about 15 mph. Fought the ticket and won.

AskReddit,ffahxga,t3_esjtyt,1579736143.0,"I was (10 yr old girl) sitting on smallish cliff, watching a boat pull a dude parasailing. When the boat crossed in front of me, the engine sputtered for a few seconds, causing the parachute-thing to dip, sweep across the rocks and scoop me up, then pull me off the cliff, tangled up in the cables and silk and out into the water. 

My dad (fishing nearby) saw it happen and he ran out into the water, used the filet knife on his belt to cut thru the mess and bring me up to the surface. I was scraped and bleeding all over, but my left wrist was just destroyed, felt like my hand was not connected to my arm by anything but the skin which was covered in friction burns from all the tangled ropes. 

The scars aren't as visible anymore, but for a couple of decades, when strangers would ask what all the scarring on my wrist was, I'd just shrug and say ""rope burns""."
