Use a coupon or savings card at the store, be effected by the weather, or the women carrying giant purses with crap in it, Or a man having a ridiculous bulging or ugly wallet."

internetparents,ffh2754,t3_etbyzf,1579921115.0,"Do a lice treatment. Comb your hair well with the special lice comb.  
Then every day or night for the next week, wash your hair with your regular shampoo.  
Use the special comb on your hair for no less than 5 mins EACH DAY for a week.  
That should rid of any lice that were possibly missed, & will get them out. 
You MUST comb ALL of them out. Hair dye, oil treatments etc will NOT be effective.  The CONSTANT DAILY COMBING is the solution.  
Also wash everything in your room, don’t forget your outer wear- sweaters / jackets, combs, brushes hair accessories. Your roommate must do the same.  
Keep in mind Lice like clean heads. So you didn’t get them bc your ‘dirty’,  they were passed from another person. Good luck!

CasualConversation,ffe1fo1,t1_ffcq7a2,1579834215.0,"There are different levels of allergies. My kid is allergic to cats, but not super bad. To the point we can have cats in our home, but when we bring them they have to be kittens. That way the kid will grow use to the cat during its sander free time when it’s a baby.   
We couldn’t bring an older cat home, it would bother her.  
And if she stays at a home where there are cats & it’s a small space, especially with a lot of carpet- she doesn’t do well."

nottheonion,feil6t3,t1_feh5o9a,1579141107.0,"There’s also a shortage of Family doctors bc school costs so much damn money, and to go into a private practice is a huge burden. I read an article about this issue and it explained it really well, and I totally understand why doctors are running to bigger hospitals, urgent care centers etc. Bc maintaining a private practice, with its staff, insurance companies, patient care, and having to stay current with medical knowledge is a lot. That’s not including the life outside the office. It’s just easier to be employed by the big hospital & you just need to treat patients & keep your medical knowledge fresh. It’s crazy"
nottheonion,feijh8a,t1_fei5a6d,1579139952.0,"Urgent Cares are popping up everywhere to help alleviate over crowding at the ER.  They are also less expensive to visit. Their costs are similar to a GP, but with better hours. Some people use UC as their main doctor. I think they’re very convenient, you can check the times before you go, if one is too busy go to the next. Although you should have a regular GP to maintain your health, or if you need to get on meds that need to be checked. But as far as emergencies go UC is the spot! Great for stitches, sprains and the like. They also do vaccines & sports physicals for that paper work that your kids need to try out for school sports. I do take my kid to the doc for her annual physical, but the timing of the sports physical differs from her regular physical. And I only have to pay 25$ out of pocket for that paperwork, same day appt, in an out in less than an hour. Look them up a bit more, there’s a lot more pros than cons."
