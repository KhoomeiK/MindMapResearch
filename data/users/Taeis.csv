That said, Iâ€™ve had kids who resisted this and I honestly have just told them (if their freak out is completely unwarranted) that they can take a seat until theyâ€™re ready to play and the I avoid paying obvious attention to them.

tifu,fega2eg,t1_feg8fe9,1579084332.0,"I realize I partially misspoke. 

We got paid daily, so $60 per day, the rest of the money we made was tips.

If we got fired we forfeited the daily pay we would have received if the trip was completed(which seems fair since we didnâ€™t work those days) but we also forfeited our right to all tips regardless of when we were fired. Because tips were divided at the end of the trip.

I think itâ€™s still probably illegal since the whole reason they could pay below minimum wage was that tips are supposed to bring the employee to a minimum wage level of pay at the very least and weâ€™d be making under minimum wage without the tips. 

There were honestly times when we barely cleared minimum wage with the tips.

If we did a 2 week trip, we got paid a base rate of $840.00 ($60*14days)
 
Our passenger capacity was 85 with 16 people(give or take 1 or 2) in the tip pool.

So each passenger would have to tip a minimum of ~$77.00 for us to hit the then minimum wage."

No idea how legal it is but one of the small cruise ships I worked for basically said if you fuck up you get fired and you donâ€™t get paid.

We got paid absolutely shit though; $60 a day plus tips, we worked 12-14 hour days and it was a senior cruise line so tips were shit too. 

We were based out of one of those lovely states where you can pay tipped employees below minimum wage, which meant the 8 stewardesses/prep cooks/waitresses/housekeepers(thatâ€™s one job description) and the 8 maintenance/mechanic/security guys were all tipped positions. It also meant the shitty tip pool was being split among 16 people when only 8 of them actually acted in a traditionally tipped service position.

Quite a few of the churchâ€™s here open with the fact that they encourage the attendance of small children at mass and have a cry room where parents can take disruptive children it has a speaker so that you donâ€™t miss anything and donâ€™t horribly disrupt mass.

Personally I donâ€™t mind kids being kids in church, theyâ€™re adorable!  

Honestly they just remind me how much I want to someday be that parent in church with my husband and our own children.

Despite having no interest and not being Protestant I ended up at a biblical Christian university and started to wonder more about God for the first time in a long time, but I didnâ€™t do anything about it. 

Then nearly a year ago I met an amazing man who happened to be Catholic, after a few weeks of talking and being curious I finally just asked if I could go to church with him. He took me and Iâ€™ve been going at least weekly ever since with or without him.

Iâ€™m now enrolled in an adult confirmation class and look forward to growing closer to God.

The non veggie options at the cafe were all normal names like â€œsizable breakfast burritoâ€ which is why it stood out so much that the only veggie options were named the way they were. 

As for the pizza place it seemed to be a general overall theme, but the veggie options had far more references than the meat. Meat was â€œpig destroyerâ€ â€œgood luck in jailâ€ â€œace of spadesâ€ with one called â€œsouth of heavenâ€. While veggie options were â€œBuffalo 666â€ â€œangel of doomâ€ â€œmaps outta hellâ€.
