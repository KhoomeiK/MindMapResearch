In one, she stabbed my father.

In another, it was almost like she was possessed, and she chased me out of the house.

I've not quite been able to make sense of those dreams.. lol"

One piece of advice - try not to confuse your general depression/loneliness for sadness over the breakup. They are two separate things, and one of them can be fixed."
Needafriend,fcmytdn,t1_fcmy3p5,1577798007.0,"Yep, I did it.

This year I didn't dig deep and find some acquaintance to hang out with so as to avoid feeling like a loser, I just accepted that I'd probably be miserable either way, so went with the less miserable option.

Things to be grateful for -

* Right now I'm in bed and it feels good man.
* I'm sober (one drink). I didn't drown my sorrows, and I will not wake up with a hangover. I look forward to sleeping in and having a nice coffee in the morning.
* No text from the ex marks one year no contact. That's a little empowering. It's time for me to move then fuck on.

Actually fuck it, best NYE in recent memory."

I spent it alone.

I did drive to a decent spot to watch the fireworks, but they're a distant memory already. Jesus fireworks can be underwhelming.

I don't know what's worse - spending NY alone, or spending it with people and being miserable anyway. I've done both. New Years IS overrated.

Happy New Year :)"
ForeverAlone,fcmwctu,t3_ei1ivn,1577795266.0,"Fellow Kiwi here. Happy New Year.

Here's a New Year's resolution for you - Go to the gym 5 times a week for an hour a day. It'll do wonders for your depression, and eventually your confidence.

Take me for example, I went to watch the fireworks alone on NY eve, and while I am lonely and feeling like a bit of a loser, and I am mostly sober, I'm not completely miserable.

Tomorrow may be a different story - fucking gym is closed.

Anyway Happy New Year again brother."

The point is that your mind is playing tricks on you.

[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/beauty-spot](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/beauty-spot)

Your mole is a non-issue. This issue exists only in your head. You are torturing yourself for no reason. At worst, people look at you and are indifferent to the way you look. Nobody gives a shit.

It wouldn't be expensive to get the mole removed, just FYI. It's not even a big deal that you want it removed. It can be done easily. Doctors remove moles all the time because they can become cancerous. But even if you did get the mole removed, wouldn't you just start to obsess over the scar instead?

You know how you can stop caring? Literally any time your brain starts to wander onto the subject of your mole, just tell yourself to shutup and then move on to another subject."

I know it's probably hard for you to accept right now, but when you're feeling down on yourself your entire perception of yourself changes.

For example, if I haven't had a haircut in a while I start to genuinely believe I'm repulsive, but after a haircut I feel pretty damn good about myself.

The point is, you are being overly critical of yourself right now even though you think you're being objective.

Get a haircut."

Don't do it.

You remember when the breakup happened and you were all confused, checking your phone every 5 seconds for something from them? Imagine that feeling x10000000. That feeling is worse than being alone missing your ex on NYE.

NYE is going to fuck with your head, your emotions are going to be heightened. Now is the worst time to break no contact.

2020 will be better. In six months you'll see."
nofriends,fcjtrk1,t3_ehee0e,1577704305.0,"M 35

I too am trying to convince myself that it's not a big deal to be alone on NYE, or that it could even be a good thing.

I have had this toxic idea stuck in my head since my teens that if I'm not with friends on NYE that I'm a total loser. I've (and we've, when I was with my partner, who also had no friends) managed to find people to hang with pretty much every year up until this one, but I never actually enjoy NYE because they're not close friends. This year I think I'm just gonna roll with the no friends thing - be an adult, cook a meal, have a couple of drinks, maybe walk up the nearest hill and watch the fireworks at midnight.

The truth is NYE is no different from any other night. Either you have friends or you don't - the day itself is irrelevant. How are we gonna fix this in the new year? that's the question."
nofriends,fcjt0un,t3_ehiec8,1577703218.0,"You might be better off asking such a question on /r/morethanzerofriends, since I can only assume most of us are here due to the fact that we suck at making and/or maintaining friendships.

To answer your question of whether you're missing out, you need to ask yourself whether you get any value out of shallow relationships. It seems to me like you've deliberately (unconsciously) set the bar high because anything less would be of no value to you.

I personally find shallow relationships fucking boring. I figure it's why social events (which are few and far between) are so damn taxing. Pretending to be a normal person and pretending to be interested in other peoples' jobs and day to day bullshit is hard.

All of the above said, I guess the only way you get to the good shit (close friends) is by enduring the shallow shit? Maybe not though.

What do I know anyway. I'm on /r/nofriends the night before New Years Eve because I have no mates (that I actually want to spend time with anyway).

I have been telling myself that 2020 will be the year I start going to meetups and bullshit like that, but the closer we get the less inclined I feel to do so.

I think about writing you, calling you, txting you, stalking you, every damn day.

I know I was a bad partner for you. I know where I failed. My behavior left you with no choice but to leave. I accept full responsibility.

My mourning has made me a better person. I have the capacity to be a better partner for you now. I've changed, and I want to continue changing. There's not much I wouldn't do for you.

I've made huge leaps forward in my life which I am dying to tell you about. I go to the gym 4-5 times a week. I bought a house. I have further grown the business that I started when we were together.

I don't like to admit this even to myself, but my need for your acceptance, approval and love is one of the main things that is driving me to be a better person.

It's been a year and I still miss and love you. It still doesn't feel like us being apart is permanent.

But it's not my 'no fucks given' attitude that stops me from reaching out.

It's that I can't face being rejected yet again. I'm not ready for that. It's the same reason why I had to go no contact. I begged you to stay, but you still left. You broke up with me, so the ball's in your court.

I'm not a mind reader, so I have to assume that you stand by your decision to end it, otherwise you would've made some effort to reach out."
AskReddit,f9mexsn,t3_e5vgb3,1575455461.0,"I came into this thread expecting positivity, and was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite. So let me jump on the negativity bandwagon.

I learned that even when things go right in my life I'm still unhappy, and that I will probably always be unhappy. I live a life of relative privilege which, even though I worked hard to attain, I don't feel I deserve and I take for granted. I always want more than what i have. I am completely and utterly without direction or purpose. I learned that I have no fucking idea what I believe about everything.

Blablabla."
