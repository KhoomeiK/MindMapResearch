ShovelKnight,feuoby7,t3_eqj6vd,1579388421.0,"What about a Space Knight? Could have a gravity-switching powers, laser guns, the whole shebang"
ShovelKnight,fetel56,t1_fetd5yg,1579374617.0,"Yo that’s sick, man, great minds think alike I suppose haha. Keep up the great work, really looking forward to this!"
ShovelKnight,fetd0fc,t3_eqj6vd,1579374051.0,How about a Music Knight? Could be really narcissistic and flamboyant (propeller-knight style) and their moveset would be super diverse.
wholesomememes,fdcm2ra,t1_fdcltom,1578278287.0,"Ooh, touché. But couldn’t you argue using that same logic that if the goal is to have more money and be happy, one should not ignore those in the search for more friends? Regardless, this was a good little thought experiment, definitely got me thinking."
wholesomememes,fdclpe5,t1_fdclg0f,1578278018.0,"I’d say being financially comfortable, you can certainly be happy and have a social life while having some monetary problems, but I’d argue that it’s a bit more difficult (obviously things vary from person to person, situation to situation)."
wholesomememes,fdclcwy,t1_fdckidi,1578277770.0,"Okay, fair enough, I’ll define success. I feel success in life is reaching financial stability (feeling comfortable” in layman’s terms), having a stable source of income or career, having some sort of social life (interacting with friends and/or family) and feeling relatively happy with your state of living."
wholesomememes,fdcjy8w,t1_fdcjfv3,1578276765.0,"I definitely see what you’re saying, and I do agree with you on some level. But I feel like your way of thinking treats success as a negative attribute, isn’t success a thing that we should all try and achieve in some way?"
wholesomememes,fdcjh23,t1_fdcj2q4,1578276424.0,"This is typically the stance I take when I answer this question, I feel like a lot of people consider getting money and fame as greedy and bad things, but as long as they don’t control your life, they can bring you a lot of happiness."
wholesomememes,fdcj8mr,t1_fdcit52,1578276257.0,"I feel you’re limiting the benefits of being successful to only inherently greedy or negative things. I feel success can bring you things like better mental health, the ability to support the ones you love, and, as you put it, more opportunities to “do good.” Those are things that I do, in fact, value in life."
wholesomememes,fdcihsw,t1_fdcifru,1578275734.0,Then what is life about? Genuine question here.
sadcringe,fcnzk66,t3_ei7jsc,1577821411.0,Guess his world was worth approximately 8 pounds.
nuzlocke,fa0nauc,t1_fa0n457,1575757614.0,"About that...
Bugs gave his life for the team during one of the gym trainer battles due to my misunderstanding on how Turtonator’s signature move worked. So that’s not really an option anymore, haha"
