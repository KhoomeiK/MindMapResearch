A 22 oz coke has 65g of sugar in it. 

10g of sugar would spike my blood glucose level ~40 points. If that sugar is in liquid form like a soda, it happens in roughly 5 minutes OR LESS. (This is why soda and OJ are recommended for hypos).

65g of sugar would spike my blood glucose level approximately 260 points. Within 5 minutes. 

If I was eating a meal that I had bolused for perfectly I may experience a rise to ~140 or so before seeing it drop back dow . With that extra sugar you're talking a blood glucose level of 400 (or more). 

DKA can begin to take effect at a blood glucose level of 250. 

Short acting insulin like humalog or novolog can take up to 2 hours to bring levels down. When levels are that high, you often need higher than normal doses (1:10 I:C ratio goes to 1:5 or less for example).

The only reason to reserve parks is if you can't visit one, or buy gear. (Or in the last turn take the 1 point first player token)

If you are taking the reserve parks action a lot, you're not doing other things you should be (unless you're using the canteen to do it, then reserve away!)"

The entire path is uploaded on Alltrails. It is also listed as 120.something miles. 

I don't recommend using the paper maps that are available, they're pretty awful.

HOWEVER

Their boards are not ""regulation size"" 

WTF does that mean?

Well, it means you can never get new discs from anyone else, because they won't fit in the hole. 

Why would you want new discs from someone else?

Michaud discs are ""toys"" and because they are not regulation they do not have the correct convex/concave sides (idk how to say it right) so they don't have the same spin or speed to them as regulation discs. 

Is it still fine to play with?

Absolutely. 

But if you've played on a regulation board with regulation discs... you'll feel the difference."

I think for comfort most people would like a wide model. 

Cottage companies are great (my quilt is from one) but it is hard to beat a place that lets you try out everything in the store, especially for a beginner. 

When my husband and I were looking for a tent we were able to set up various tents in the store and ""play"" with them a bit before making a decision. It definitely made us feel a lot better about dropping $$$ when we were able to fiddle with it before purchase."

Are they comfortable?
Do they make a fuckton of noise everytime you move? üòÇ

A pad that works for one person may not work for another based on so many different things (height, weight, sleep style)."

I 100% agree someone should have tapped this teacher on the shoulder and said, ""Hey- this might come across as insensitive, you should change that!"" But I don't agree with the amount of hate, vitriol, and name calling going on.

Did the teacher make a mistake? Yes. 

Is he racist? Based on this? ... No, I don't think so."
