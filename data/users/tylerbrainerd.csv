hypotheticalsituation,few762q,t1_feue5rh,1579406295.0,"7% is incredibly attainable with those numbers available to diversify in extremely wide ways. I think once you have more than multiple millions you could that in stocks and average 8% dividends in a year without even doing a tremendous amount of legwork. You could find plenty of growing communities and buy real estate and ride out 9% equity growth without even worrying about rental income itself. 

Once you start hiring managers and money managers there's all kinds of additional elements in play. 100,000,000 is enough to start an insurance carrier, get reinsurance, and make 9-12% annualized.

If you loved the originals and rewatched them hundreds of times, there are probably a lot of things in the prequels and some things in the sequels that are really difficult. If you grew up on the prequels, the sequels are a huge tone change. If you loved 7, 8 was probably a challenge to get through. If you loved 8, 9 feels like a disappointment. 

I think every star wars fanboy (myself included) goes into every new film hoping it redeems or touches on a 'mistake' from the past, while also desperately hoping it doesn't tough some other element we hate. Some people see only lucas approved things as real, while others look at the prequels, the special editions, even choices made in RotJ as being out of touch and missing the point.
