bulletjournal,fdd9ttt,t1_fdd1q4y,1578301581.0,Couldn't agree more. I don't bother with yearly view or monthly spread. I just create to do list for a week in form of a table and then write any thoughts on daily entry.

I think it really depends on what you are hoping to get out of it. I am not artsy at all, so mine is more of a journal/weekly to do list and tracker of habits I want to develop. I don't do fancy cover pages or decorate each day/week/month spread. I focus mine on functionality rather than look. I also use it in combination with normal digital calendar, because I find it easier to create reoccurring appointments and reminders on there than on bujo

Bujo is meant to be personalised, so just use it for things you think will be helpful to you"
declutter,fdc2c0d,t3_ekk5ze,1578265713.0,"We are going through decluttering at our house now, and I found that going around the house and getting rid of trash first like empty boxes, used, old or empty hygiene and beauty products, broken stuff etc cuts down a lot. Then divide your space into manageable sections like one box/cupboard/shelf and just do one section per day. If you feel like you can do more than one you can continue to another section. 

It helps if you shred paper as you do this, so you don't have to then spend another time just shredding things (don't throw away stuff into recycling that has your personal information). 

We created couple of bags for stuff to give away to family, recycle or throw away and trying to get these out of the house as quickly as we can. It makes a huge difference to have so much less to think about, good luck!"
