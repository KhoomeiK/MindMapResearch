It’s not about width, but about creating consistent flow. 

If you have a one-lane road with clogged traffic, you encounter situations where someone can’t turn left because oncoming traffic doesn’t provide a break. With an additional lane, you can create better flow. 

Even adding something like a “suicide lane” would help. Sorry if that term doesn’t translate well lol but it’s a shared middle lane used for turning only."

Kevin replied to the post, which is why it’s nestled under Nick’s caption. 

So Nick *tried* to make fun of Kevin for being “weak,” but Nick wasn’t aware he had improper form and was using unnecessary equipment, which is what Kevin pointed out. 

It’s like someone taking a photo of you playing football and then some tool takes your photo, poses with a soccer ball, and posts it with a caption like “I bet this dude really birdies buckets like Serena Williams in a race car.”"

Then every four months, the DEA and your state make you schedule a follow up appointment to make sure you aren’t selling your meds, which isn’t covered by any insurer. 

Also, the manufacturer of your meds only gets enough supplies for 11 months, so every January you have to bum rush the pharmacy or wait five weeks to get the first refill of the year. 

Oh, by then your plan went up in cost, you now have a prescription deductible, and your “new” plan will only cover generics. 

In February, Stanford buys out your hospital which means your doctor is no longer in-network. Your doctor quits and no doctors in the area are accepting patients. Then Stanford denies your petition for a payment plan until you get a letter of recommendation stating you truly can’t pay your bill in full. There’s a fee and interest added for each late payment. 

Later that night, you watch an ad from Stanford about their commitment to healthcare."

Most applicant tracking systems (ATS) account for this and your resume will render into a mess of plaintext. 

It’s an old school “black hat” SEO technique from the early Dot Com era. You’re stuffing keywords by hiding them from the human eye by changing the font front black to white, changing the font size, etc. In essence, the browser or software can still read the keywords, but people cannot. 

If you try to do this with a web page, every search engine will black list your domain. You’ll stop appearing in organic search the second a site crawler sees blocks of grammatically incoherent text wrapped in suspicious CSS."
