cats,ff39sm3,t1_ff2ameg,1579537033.0,"I did join FIP Warriors onFacebook! The problem is that I am a college student and can’t afford to pay for an experimental drug when it’s still not FDA approved and isn’t guaranteed to work. I know that Mutian is the one that works best, but it’s also the most expensive. I have been able to cover all of his vet bills so far. I also feel that if I can’t buy the full treatment, I am only prolonging his suffering. Hope that comes across without seeming cold. This decision has had me falling apart everyday."

cats,ff08ucs,t1_ff07rdl,1579466425.0,"I actually have looked into it a lot. It looks like a really promising drug, but since it’s not FDA approved, vets can’t administer it. You can buy the drug without going through a vet, but the problem is that for Calcifer, it would cost upwards of $4000 to get him into remission. The drug is extremely expensive which is absolutely heartbreaking."

tarot,fen9358,t3_eq27h5,1579279643.0,I’m fairly new to Tarot - got into the practice about three months ago. What is a “deck interview?” I was just gifted a new deck that I haven’t opened yet. Is this a common thing to do?

bipolar,fdxt55r,t3_en1nb9,1578772629.0,This is incredible. My paintings during times like that often have a similar style in terms of the darkness and stroke style. But seriously. This is moving and encapsulating. Excellent job.

CatAdvice,fc7nwhs,t1_fc7hs16,1577513810.0,"I had him checked when i first took him home, but getting him checked again is a really good idea! I’m doing mostly scheduled feeding. I try to do it at 8 am, 1 or 2 pm and then 7 or 8 pm. I tend to leave some dry food out throughout the day. He just snacks so much that it’s hard for him to eat it all during a schedule. Is there something else I should try?"
CatAdvice,fc7npee,t1_fc7k942,1577513593.0,My cat definitely prefers pate and won’t touch anything else haha. I put some hot water into it and that usually gets him hungrier. I might try the microwave though... seems like a good option. Thanks!
CatAdvice,fc4b1lk,t3_eg3pxw,1577411513.0,"This genuinely worries me. Just from reading this, it almost sounds like the vet/techs might be the problem. If his paw is swollen already, they may have put it in improperly the first time. To have an animal who is usually skittish move into a full meltdown makes me concerned for how he is being treated in that office. I haven’t heard of a drop-off for just an exam or dental exam so that already seems off to me. I would take your kitty somewhere else if possible. Even if the office is ethical, I think your cat is too scarred to go back. To calm him down, you could try Feliway! It’s just natural cat pheromones that help cats ease into different situations or relieve anxiety. Placing his favorite treats on the floor (without getting too close to him and not feeding him by hand) could help him have a sense of familiarity too. I’m so sorry that you’re dealing with this and I hope he’s okay! Best of luck."
