personalfinance,ff84wbt,t3_es63cc,1579666072.0,"In my opinion, going to college is a heavily scripted part of society that demolishes a lot of people financially. There’s no reason why you can’t just start working full time at 18 and then go apply for colleges. Plus, a degree in a field is pretty much just as good no matter where you go, barring the top 5 schools. It is this rule burned into our brains that we are all supposed to graduate high school then go get a loan (with zero collateral) for as much as a house just to get a degree! What’s the degree for? If it’s to make money, simple math would show that it’s almost never a good idea."

personalfinance,ff4nx8a,t1_ff4mcjw,1579568205.0,"What I’m saying is that you can’t just treat yourself in whatever way you want. That’s the QOL part. You have to live within your means if you want to fix this, and that might mean living somewhere less fancy, driving a crappy car. Etc. and no. Getting rid of that -750 would help you tremendously. You already are -$200k in debt. Lower that. Any savings are kind of an illusion because that -$750 still applies the whole while

Your return for paying off the debt will be at least the interest rate owed... and honestly there’s no guarantee of any stock market investment or other investment. Usually nobody beats the s&p anyway. The debt should be your top priority."

povertyfinance,ff1lngq,t3_er1qws,1579481207.0,"Buying a Starbucks drink is not a problem. The real problems arise when you look at the BIG bills:

How much am I spending on rent?

Or conversely, is my house too big? Why am I paying so much for the place I live if I could live somewhere cheaper?

How much am I spending on a car? Could I get a cheaper used car? What about insurance? 

Child support. You know. 

Credit card debt.

Student loans.

Basically any other monthly expenses. Not talking $10 per month like Spotify but the BIG ones. That’s the key.

Those are the things people should be worried about. Buy yourself a Starbucks drink, who cares? If it makes you happy do it. I can guarantee you though that the big bills above are not going to make you much happier when you’re paying more for them!! You know where the real cuts need to be.

People say “oh those are bills” as if any amount is necessary. The truth is, your bills are determined by what you sign up for and what you choose to buy. Of course there is a bare minimum cost to live, and you want quality. But you know where you need to look when it comes to cutting down expenses (your main bills)"

Swimming,fez31vi,t1_feyhzfm,1579453420.0,"Yes! Just like when your swim volume decreases, you stop lifting weights. The lack of soreness (and all the time you spent working hard) will come out fully when you’re well rested. 

I always struggled with improving my sprint times, because I had gotten my 50 splits really close together. Then my younger brother went through the program (we both swam breast) and focused hardcore on the weight room. 

He ended up going 26 for a 50 breast and 59 for a 100. I was barely under 30 for a 50 but I’d go 31/33 for the 100.

His splits fell off more but it didn’t matter because he was fast. Being fast is the whole point of racing!

I’d even go so far as to say sprinting (and power) are the main thing in swimming unless you’re doing miles long open water swims. Even the 500 is swam at a very very fast speed at state, college, sectionals, etc. There is no such thing as a “distance” event in high school or summer swim."

There are several basic movements you should be doing in the gym:

Bench press (or incline), squats, overhead press, and deadlifts.

You should also do bicep curls, pull-ups, and abs.
