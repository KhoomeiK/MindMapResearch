THe reason the switch was made to 5.56 for general infantry use is because it is more likely to tumble in the human body, causing WORSE tissue and organ injuries and incapacitating the combatant without necessarily killing them right away, causing them to become a distraction to other fighters, decreasing the overall effectiveness of a combat unit. It's also less expensive to manufacture and issue, and is also a lighter round, allowing the soldier to carry a larger combat load of ammunition.

It's a fucking myth that there are such things as weapons that are ""too deadly"" for the military to use, that is some fucking fudd-ass shit. /u/Accmonster1 is probably the type of moron who also believes the .50 BMG has been banned for use in war (it hasn't and is a very common sharpshooter round in the military and used to shoot human targets all the time).

You see it all the time in men who are laid off/unemployed for longer than a few weeks. They often turn to escapism (video games, drugs, alcohol) which masks the problem but doesn't solve it. In some extreme fringe cases there is a more serious version called ""Failed Provider Syndrome"" which can turn a man violent against his own family, in a misguided sense of wanting to save them from having to suffer poverty.

Other classic signs are intense selfishness and a disregard for how their decisions affect their victims or other people, or rather an inability to empathize emotionally with those people (i.e. they don't understand emotions and have almost zero emotional intelligence, and when they have their own brief periods of emotions they tend to be extremely intense and uncontrollable, usually anger and rage, otherwise psychopaths tend to be pretty emotionally dead). Bereaved mothers do not behave like that unless they are deeply fucked up psychopaths. Are you literally fucking 12? You don't know shit about the case.

""Support and fortitude"" lmao they were comped and they finished major emotional processing days ago. Not everyone is an uncontrollable mess when someone they know dies. In fact most people aren't - for all we know her team didn't like GiGi much (harsh but we all know how high school girls are and how envy and jealousy works). Anyway even if they did like her they can hold it in in public areas. /u/falbi23 is sucking them off for no reason without knowing any of them personally or what their emotional state is. That kind of shit is obnoxious. They aren't ""tough girls"", they are normal people.

And also, girls who like basketball getting asked to come to professional NBA game and sit courtside, for free. Of course they are going to go. It doesn't take fortitude to make that decision, regardless about their feelings about the crash.

I hate how people get about strangers whenever a tragedy happens *to somebody else's family that they don't know*. It's obnoxious. There's such a thing as ""forced empathy"" i.e. insincerity, where someone is showing a form of pseudo-empathy designed to make themselves feel like a good person rather than actually caring for a stranger. ***It's on full display here with people not realizing that Alyssa and Payton, two other girls on the same team, also died. The first reply to the top comment in this very thread is a great example of forced empathy, and all the people who upvoted it to feel good about themselves are equally guilty of it. Every downvote this comment gets just drives home my point about people using forced empathy for strangers to feel good about themselves.***"

One thing that is super weird: For an outside observer looking toward you, it would appear to them at some point like you just froze and stopped moving. The closer you get to the black hole, the slower time goes for you, but people outside are still perceiving time normally. So eventually their perception of you just stops and hangs in one place, even though you perceive that you are continuing to move toward the black hole's center.

In reality when you cross into that zone, the outside observer would not be able to see you because being able to see you would require light reflecting off your body, which is not possible as black holes also trap light, so at the point where it seems like time would ""stop"" and freeze you in place, you actually just disappear from their visual perception. However, this would take a VERY VERY long time (perhaps to the heat death of the universe or whenever the black hole dies) because as you approach that point, you appear to get slower and slower, until you are imperceptibly slow, so you TECHNICALLY look frozen to the outside observer, but you really aren't - humans just don't have the capacity to observe something moving as slowly as you would be (to them).
