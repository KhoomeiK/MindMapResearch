focals,feh96ya,t3_ep3wj4,1579111752.0,"These questions are pointing to a design I very much am not happy with. The phrase ""open source"" appears nowhere (except in the giant number of other people's libraries utilized by North in the app's legal section).

As North moves on to 2.0, the original Focals are being left in the dust. Because there are no developer tools, and the ""Focals OS"" is entirely closed source, the functionality of this device is limited to what it has now, and nothing else. 3rd party developers cannot carry the torch and tinker with the underlying navigation structure, UI structure, embedded applications, etc. 

I support North because you have been pioneers in bringing a new device form factor to the world. I voted with my wallet to help bring the future to us a little bit faster. From day one, I never expected the first gen to be perfect by any means - but I did expect it to be a device that I as a tech enthusiast could tinker and play with. I've written [apps and tools](https://github.com/software-2/FocalsMessenger) that interface with Focals, but this is not remotely what I know these devices are capable of if open source developers are given full access. How much cool tech could be there at launch of 2.0 if people had the opportunity to design things? How differently would the official interface be if there were a few open source alternatives out there to provide alternative viewpoints?

Then there's the fear factor: North has been hit with layoffs in the past, and I'm sure that taking your only product off the market has not been good for your finances. Sure, Focals 2.0 will have 3rd party apps, but every person interested in buying Focals, not just developers, needs to consider the real possibility that if Focals 2.0 fails, if competitive products come to market that do things better (read: Apple ""invents"" smart glasses), what will happen to your expensive pair of smart glasses? Do they become an expensive paperweight if the Focals app goes off the Apple / Google marketplaces because the company has shut down? If the core code is open source, not just a way for people to write apps, there is at least the possibility that open source developers will pick up the torch and extend the life of your purchase."

focals,fdnt6me,t3_emb07r,1578592335.0,"**SDK** - Let us have full access to everything, right down to changing the navigation structure. Job postings indicate you're using C++? That's fine. My only ask here is that it stops me from bricking the device, but otherwise gives me full access.

**API** - Let us push/pull information to/from the device easily. If this needs to route through the phone app first, cool. But give us some way to alter the display and receive inputs.

**Open Source** - It sure would be great if North was committed to the advancement of smart glasses with the release of source code. We all know the target demographic for these devices is tech enthusiasts, and you would have a lot of code written by enthusiasts like myself. And as an added bonus, this would give some confidence that our $600+ devices won't automatically become paperweights in the future when the device becomes old or something else happens."
