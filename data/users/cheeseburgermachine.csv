dryalcoholics,ffr224j,t3_eugf1g,1580148750.0,"Try different meds. Lexapro made anxiety worse for me. I took it a whole week like they say to do and it was awful. I would just come home from work and lay on the couch and comfort watch something like 30 rock and then I'd hope the anxiety would fade. When I stopped taking it, I felt better and was given other meds to try. I'm on buspar now and it seems to work for me."
dryalcoholics,ffr1fwb,t1_ffnjxij,1580148363.0,Totally agree with this. I can go get this alcohol anytime and anywhere and that's hard to stop yourself from doing. I thinks that's a unique challenge with us and it being socially acceptable.
dryalcoholics,ffr0vmw,t3_esjdu3,1580148003.0,"How are you doing now? Still drinking? Just curious. It's been 5 years daily for me. I had 8 last night. Very slowly tapering. Probably do 8 again tonight. Once I get to 6 I think I'll be ok to quit. It's a hard fight. I had to cancel plans with friends because I knew I'd drink too much. The weekends usually get me. And the no sleep usually get me so I've been knocking myself out each night with some pretty strong muscle relaxers. I know that's not healthy but I need it to quit. Anyways, I wish you luck."
dryalcoholics,ffg2wh7,t1_ffg1fbc,1579897290.0,"Try some different drugs. Some used to work for me but one day just stopped. Some make it worse. The one I'm on now is like at least the 10th drug I've tried for anxiety and I finally found one that works and it's not a benzo. I honestly just wanted to give up trying these drugs. But glad I didn't. Has some weird side effects like making my face tingle after taking it but it goes away pretty quick. No idea what that's about lol.

Anyways I totally understand the depression part of it. I know that'll be waiting for me when I get sober. Just be proud you are working on yourself.  

One thing I wanted to mention. Right now I wish I could pull an all nighter. I could do that now but it would require me to continue drinking all night which I do not want to do for several reasons. I just want to do an all nighter by myself and play my favorite video game until the sun comes up. I'm going to do that when I get sober. Another thing I want to do is go on more dates with my wife at night. Go see a play or comedy show or go see xmas lights. That was something she wanted to do. Go around looking at xmas lights but I cant driver her around if I'm drinking. It's little things like that I want to do when I get sober."
dryalcoholics,fffh2uk,t1_fffg7q1,1579883811.0,I have some but never tried it. I wanted to get sober first. Maybe I'll try it today. Got nothing better to do.
dryalcoholics,fffa6wk,t3_etbhbo,1579879469.0,"I had to look up wagon wheels and trifles lol I'm not much of a dessert person. 

I do this sometimes though. I basically eat my emotions. I find comfort in certain foods when I'm feeling depressed. My go to when I've had a bad day is an italian sub and a coke. I don't know why but since I was a kid those 2 things always made me feel better. Pizza always make me feel better and cheeseburgers definitely make me feel better. 

Just try not to do it all the time. For me I track my moods and try to find what triggers a good or bad mood kind of day. In good days for some reason it involves food but I can't always rely on that to have a good day lol. Being social usually leads to a good day too but being social exhausts me sometimes too. 

Anyways! Goodluck!"
dryalcoholics,fff9jdu,t3_et9vs7,1579879044.0,"A month sober is pretty awesome. You should be proud of that. It is very hard to do. 

I know it is boring but you just have to be interested in something else. Go walk around in the forest. Go learn how to something. Get interested in all sorts of things. Drinking yourself to death isn't interesting or fun and it's very sad honestly.

I hate that I haven't had a sober day in 5 years. It's a prison I've locked myself into. Every night I basically put myself in prison in my house and can't leave because I have to drink. Use this time you're not drinking to do fun things like going out to a movie at night or something. I don't know. But this shit is not fun or funny or interesting at all. It's very sad I can't live a normal day or have a night out without drinking. Sorry for the rambling. Just remember what it was like before being sober. It's not a lifestyle I've ever wanted for myself to be a drunk."
dryalcoholics,fff8o9l,t3_esvyql,1579878471.0,Focus on yourself first. You had the convo with your roomie to check on them. Whether they lied or not doesn't matter. You reached out to them and that's all you have to do. Just be honest with each other. Maybe they did just put it in another bottle. Maybe they didn't. If they didn't then let them tell you that. No need to go poking and prying. You're not their parent so all you can do is check on them and let them check on you. Focus on you not drinking.
dryalcoholics,fff7ydm,t3_et6gyu,1579877973.0,"You should see a doctor if your urine is orange. I'm gonna say it's probably dehydration but maybe do a piss test? Anyways, if you're working out too hard too and cant stay hydrated you may want to scale back on the exercise time and let your body get hydrated enough to handle it."
dryalcoholics,fff786z,t3_esw7tp,1579877470.0,Medications work differently for everyone and some need higher doses while others need lower doses. I would say keep a journal or track your mood with these prescriptions. For me I take like 1/4 of my recommended dose for this anti anxiety medicine because the full dose is overkill and honestly I lose my filter. I start to say things that could be mean or unacceptable and not think anything of it.
dryalcoholics,fff6vfo,t3_eswqo2,1579877221.0,Taper if you can. Give your body and mind time to heal. I'm not going to say to abstain completely if you can but I will say after quitting and starting back up it gets much harder to kick the habit later on. If I could tell my 25 year old self to stop I would have begged and pleaded with him to just stop and smoke weed or just find another outlet other than drugs. Become addicted to your passion. What you are passionate about in life can be a good replacement.
dryalcoholics,fff6hkk,t3_et7hcx,1579876943.0,"Don't compare your life to others. Don't look back on your past unless it is to reflect and learn from past mistakes. Don't be so hard on yourself. Try to be sober. Try to look towards the future and what you want from it. Not what anyone else wants. Write it all out. I want to be ____, I want to do _____, I will get there by doing _____. And then you just get to work on it. I know it's easier said than done but this is what I do when I feel stuck or bored with my life."
dryalcoholics,fff5ntp,t1_ffeyy08,1579876338.0,I used the NY recipe if you're interested. It turned out pretty good. https://slice.seriouseats.com/2012/07/the-pizza-lab-three-doughs-to-know.html
dryalcoholics,ffdg1tc,t3_eslyye,1579820116.0,"I am not big on baked goods like desserts but I did make some pizza dough and it was fun. Not at all hard like I thought it would be. Baked bread is the best thing in the world sometimes with just a little butter. 

I'm sorry to hear they pressured you. That's how it goes sometimes. All I can say is stat strong and turn down those drinks. I slipped up and didnt turn down a drink on NYE a few years ago and haven't been sober since so like some say it really is a slippery slope for some. I didnt immediately become and alcoholic but fell into it again a few weeks after trying to moderate. 

Also yeah, stick to vaping. I like smoking but I just cannot do it. I feel much better I'm not imbibing on 2 addictions. I use a low nicotine level of .3 so I don't feel addicted at all and it helped me stop. I only do it at night now when I'm unwinding. 

Anyways! Goodluck!"

dryalcoholics,feo73ki,t3_epteom,1579295974.0,It's good you said NA beer. I've wondered how I'd handle that. I think honestly that would be enough to keep the craving away for me if I were sober. I've been thinking about mixing that with my normal beers to get me to stop. It's like a habit and a ritual for me to drink and when I've hit my limit I always say fuck it and keep going. I just need some NA beers in there or at the end I think.

movies,feo2ojr,t1_feo1sy3,1579294269.0,I would do the study. What would be the micro dosage? I feel like mine is micro dosing. I average 12 a day. That's only half a standard unit of alcohol in a 24 hour period.
movies,feo1jcr,t1_feo0h2m,1579293870.0,"Study me lol. I have at least 12 drinks everyday. And the result is falling into alcoholism for 5 years. A failing mind and body. Full blown physical dependence, high blood pressure, fatty liver, and a ton of other abdominal related issues."
movies,feo0gdk,t1_fee4gh6,1579293495.0,Real shit right here.
movies,feo0dfz,t1_feesf15,1579293454.0,The problem with micro dosing alcohol is you build a tolerance very quick. If you take the same amount everyday you don't get drunk and don't get euphoria either. Also this can create the physical alcohol dependence even in small amounts. Basically you just damage the body for little or no reward.
movies,fenzydb,t1_fefszjb,1579293221.0,"This assumes every alcoholic is violent, unpredictable and like to verbally abuse people.

Not all alcoholics are like that. In fact a small amount are. There's plenty that lead functional lives these days and aren't assholes. 

Anyways not standing up for those that are. Just saying I've met parents who were alcoholics and never screwed up their kids."

dryalcoholics,fehxh0x,t1_fehb2s7,1579125812.0,Thiamine I think it's called. Yeah just take some vitamins but def stay hydrated and see a doc. One thing I know I'm going to have a hard time with is my muscles when I get sober because I haven't used them much at all in 5 years aside from house chores. Another thing too is if you workout make sure you're getting a healthy amount of protein. You dont have to have a lot but that could cause muscle  issues.
dryalcoholics,fehwlio,t3_eov58m,1579125309.0,"Good job man. Keep it up. I did a year sober once and then let it pull me back in. I wish I'd never bought that bottle but I thought, hey I've been at this for 1 year, I can handle a few shots and go to bed. And that's what I did. Just a few shots. Go to bed. Go to work. Wait until the weekend. Have some drinks then. Have a few more during the week and I did that for a long time. After maybe 6 months though I fell back into daily drinking :( and forgot I ever even had a problem with it.

All I'm saying is it's a slippery slope for me. And I'm just trying to share my personal experience after 1 year. I relapsed and now here I am 5 years now I've been drinking everyday. I had 13 last night. Only meant to have 11 but at a certain inebriation I don't care very much. The core of my stomach is always inflamed and hurts. I have no idea what's going on. This is hell.

Anyways I'm proud of you. Stick to it and be addicted to anything else (like a hobby, not drugs) but this shit."
dryalcoholics,fehvbdq,t1_fehufez,1579124585.0,I am hoping that is the case that I will not just crumble into nothing. I did one year sober back when I was 27 I think. It was good for me physically. Very good! and mentally helped a bit but it was such a struggle to ward off depression during that time. My libido was shit and I had my first real panic attack then. It was so hard to dodge drinking too because of friends always wanting to drink. Ugh. Glad I don't think it will be bad like that anymore now that I'm 35. In the plus side that year sober I was able to hold a steady job that's launched me into the career I'm in now so that's a big plus.
dryalcoholics,fehui6y,t3_ep2bd6,1579124123.0,"What is gabapentin like? Does it make you drowsy at all? Also, don't worry about what your friends are thinking so much. If they're good friends they just want you to be happy and they dont want you to force yourself to go out if it means you're gonna have a bad time.

interestingasfuck,fdnwdrh,t1_fdix83t,1578594200.0,"As an alcoholic yes there are many levels. I'm a daily drinker but only at night. It's very easy to tell someone who drinks all day because I was that person at one point. With me people may know even when I'm sober during the day because I'm very bloated all the time and have puffy eyes that are hidden behind very strong lenses. The glassy eye is very unique too if someone still has alcohol in their blood. If I don't shower and rinse well it would be very easy to tell. I smell like a beer when sweating. You can tell with vodka drinkers they will smell like vodka if they're sweaty. Also, since our pee is terrible from dehydration, you may be able to pick up that distinct smell. I make sure to use hand soap all over, then shower gel, then hand soap under pits and genitals again when I shower to make sure I don't smell like beer from the night before. Very strong deodorant too."

cripplingalcoholism,fdlad3n,t1_fdiiaod,1578519815.0,I breathe hard after getting out of the shower. All that moving around.
cripplingalcoholism,fdla9sy,t3_elnldv,1578519762.0,Yeah in a technical position it is way too hard to work even after 2 or 3 beers. I just lose all cares and can't think as sharply.
cripplingalcoholism,fdla40d,t3_els2k9,1578519668.0,I have not but would in a heartbeat to keep withdrawals at bay.
dryalcoholics,fdl9o6u,t3_elyt0u,1578519420.0,Welcome and good job on day 2. I hope you find employment and yeah it's really cold to be doing some outdoors stuff. I would say you could try to bundle up as much as possible and go for a walk to a park or something. Anyways I'm still struggling and hope I can be sober someday.
dryalcoholics,fdl8wbs,t3_elhcmx,1578519036.0,Nice! Congrats on that. I also have been doing water colors. The last one I did was a self portrait. I'm not very good at it but it's fun for me. I have a whole list of things I want to try and do but I'm running out of paper. Keep finding things to do for hobbies. Sometimes I think about doing bike paths or walking paths at parks but it's too cold right now.
dryalcoholics,fdl8hs7,t1_fdk3fpw,1578518841.0,This. It is a pretty expensive habit.
dryalcoholics,fdl8dvg,t1_fdk9uhl,1578518786.0,Take on a new project man! I'm gonna try to do all the housework I've been putting off when I drink at night. Things like fixing up the basement or painting the house. All kinds of things need done
dryalcoholics,fdl86e5,t3_elq0hv,1578518682.0,This is what I look forward to the most I think. I hit up like 6 or 7 different gas stations currently so they don't remember me so much. They're very chummy and friendly around here so some of them do recognize me and talk with me.
dryalcoholics,fdl7wmb,t3_elxvze,1578518553.0,I'm not sure if I'm real agoraphobic but I am a big hermit even without the drinking. I'm not necessarily afraid of being out and in big crowds but I don't really enjoy it much either. I have found that since working from home full time I'm very lonely sometimes and get easily exhausted from meeting people or attending family events.
dryalcoholics,fdl6vx7,t3_elgwfa,1578518060.0,"Ah man the first time I got sober I just told everyone I had some health issues and couldn't drink but would sip on coke/water or whatever else. Bars sometimes will give you free soft drinks on the house if you're not drinking. 

As for the social aspect of it, it was the worst. I spent most my time talking to drunks outside while I'm chain smoking like a crazy person. My gf at the time would get so sloppy drunk, it was a big turn off at the time. It's a little isolating but just stick to your guns and if you feel like they are pressuring you or you're just tired of their drunkenness then head home and chill."
dryalcoholics,fdl5lt6,t3_elsc2l,1578517442.0,Goodluck!!
todayilearned,fdl3bsy,t1_fdjmpw6,1578516344.0,"I don't think he is trying to be cool with this story. I think he's just telling a story. I have one where a cop drove me back to a party I was leaving instead of letting me drive because he thought I was perfectly coherent and didn't think I was drunk but he smelled some alcohol on me so didn't want me to drive and didnt necessarily want to take me in. 

I'm not proud of it but sometimes cops give people breaks and sometimes they don't.  And let me stress I am not proud of this!! I did get a DUI later on because my alcoholic ass never learned from that previous encounter and since then I've never drove drunk again. I thought it was acceptable because all my friends and family did it at that time and nobody had any problems. People that were obviously fucked up beyond belief we would take their keys and not let them leave. We would sometimes call them a taxi. 

When you get a DUI where I live they make you take a weekend stay at a hotel with other offenders and show you how bad it can be even if you've only had 1 or 2 drinks within an hour period of time you will be over the legal limit and any accidents that happen after that they will throw the book at you. Lives get destroyed. We saw all the footage of people blackout drunk doing stupid shit and its stuck with me since. I will always call an uber or taxi or stay wherever I am for the night if I'm drinking."
videos,fdivgm1,t1_fc92vzi,1578451942.0,You're getting down voted but just know you're not alone. Witcher 3 is my fav game but even I skip a lot of these cut scenes for one reason or another. For me the worst offender is the metal gear games. I feel like I can't even play the game because of so many cutscenes.
SandersForPresident,fdi23ob,t1_fdhkfnr,1578434362.0,"It is a different level of political maturity I think because I was like this 4 years ago. Now that I've become more political and I am participating and researching on my own I can see the error of my ways. I will vote party this time because I don't want to see 4 more years of trump. It is that simple. Even if I already know the county I am in is very liberal and biden or sanders or whomever will get it. 

What if everyone thought the way I did? I thought surely the more politically versed adults in this country were smarter than voting for trump. I was completely wrong. All we need is more people who lean left to vote this time and not brush it off thinking things will get better without action."
SandersForPresident,fdi17vs,t1_fdh12ib,1578433930.0,"I am like you in a way. I didn't vote for Hillary or Trump. Not that it mattered.. the city I'm in is very liberal. She won this county easily. It was all the other counties in the state that were red. However, this year idgaf. I don't like biden but I hate trump more. So if biden does somehow beat out bernie then he will have my vote. All I am saying here is, even if theres a snowball's chance of hell to get trump and the GOP out of power I'm voting liberal and I know it feels like an insignificant vote but hopefully I can change someone's mind who's on the fence to go out and participate in voting. It's literally the only voice we have besides social media to show who we want in office."
dryalcoholics,fdfxsq8,t1_fdfj068,1578373185.0,Lol that's how it goes man. Taper is hard for some of us. I used to have great results with it but this last time it's been about 5 years and I try to taper everyday and can't. I think someone's going to have to just have to strap me into a bed and feed me drugs until it's over or until I die. It sucks so hard now. Quit now while you can.
dryalcoholics,fdfecbo,t1_fdez56g,1578359703.0,Thank you! For some reason I cant see it so thank you.
dryalcoholics,fdfeahv,t1_fdfdxuc,1578359671.0,Lol thank you. I have no idea its cake day on the reddit is fun app I'm using Haha
dryalcoholics,fdf9ul0,t1_fdf5jws,1578356680.0,That is all you can do. Take it a little bit a time and it will be tomorrow soon enough

dryalcoholics,fdevwh9,t3_ekpvbp,1578347699.0,"This is a cheesy thing to say but it's from the Batman movies... when Alfred says to Bruce Wayne, why do we fall down? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up. It has stuck with me. And I know addiction is not simply learning to stop drinking. Some small part of is but there's much more to it. We are physically and mentally addicted to this stuff. But what I take from the quote is that you sometimes fall down or fail and you just have to keep trying to not fall down or fail again. Some people will stay on the ground and never get back up. Some will fail and never try again. Keep trying and I hope some day you and I both conquer this thing."
dryalcoholics,fdev4dx,t3_el04ju,1578347237.0,Not a cook but I hope you stick with cooking but ditch the booze. Be an example to others that they can ditch the booze too and still be a great cook. Also just for fun you can make some fancy non alcoholic drinks. See what you can come up with haha.
