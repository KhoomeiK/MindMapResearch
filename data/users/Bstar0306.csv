bulletjournal,ff8yqy7,t3_eqwh9z,1579700327.0,Yeah I've gone back n forth I just don't really know anyone where I live the ppl I do know never want to do anything. There's not much to do entertainment wise other than driving without driving an hour too the next big city. So I just go to work and come home most days not much to write in a planner
StAugustine,ff8y9u8,t1_ff7yy9b,1579699940.0,Yeah that's why I'm looking for work at home /remote opportunities and starting my own business. Can't handle a 3 hour daily commute.
bulletjournal,ff26cyd,t3_eqwh9z,1579495072.0,lol my life is super boring so i find bullet journaling and planning boring/hard in general. Like I get all into it and then realize I have nothing to write lol
ynab,ff25wra,t1_fey4zce,1579494698.0,"I agree the reports have never been strong. And most of the reports show what you have spent not money saved in categories. 

The excel idea is a good idea. I always forget that we can do that. I ended up just manually going thorough the last year of budgets to see how much I added to the savings category each month."
weddingshaming,fewwech,t1_fewpyw9,1579420524.0,Yeah that’s what I figured.
weddingshaming,fewldp3,t3_eqpbxp,1579413518.0,"I would get it if they were given like a years notice but they are being given 3-4 months notice...airfare needs to be booked way in advance for stuff like this. I would not go into debt for an out of town wedding. I would tell my parents that we cannot afford it and if you really want us there you can pay for the airfare.

Honestly if it was me I would just go by myself and see if I could afford that and then see if I could share a room with a family member but that is like worst case scenario."
ynab,fewky3j,t3_eqmslm,1579413090.0,It's annoying b/c it shows up in ynab differently than my bank statement so i get confused while reconciling.
restaurantowners,feirfoo,t1_feg0mu3,1579145326.0,"I am not the GM so it's not up to me. I would think we'd have to do some change in the POS with the tips. 

Honestly we tip out food runners and bussers a small amount I think those amounts should go on their paychecks. I wonder how much it would mess up payroll....we've actually talked about switching payroll from weekly to biweekly."
restaurantowners,feirbd9,t1_fec7vli,1579145243.0,yup
restaurantowners,fefzrn0,t1_fecj2r4,1579070896.0,oh I know it's not a loss. It's just annoying because it basically messes up petty cash constantly. But yeah the only way to fix it is to put the cc tips on paychecks and I'm sure people won't like that.
weddingplanning,fefz2fi,t3_eoqi9g,1579070131.0,One reason I love weddings is to see family I don't get to see often due to distance. The joke is you only see some people at weddings and funerals and it's really true and I think more people tend to go to weddings than funerals..sadly.
restaurantowners,feb2uhl,t1_feb2e49,1578954951.0,Yeah that’s what I kind of figured. Eventually we get a positive n we can fix the negative. But it’s a constant. There’s actually a restaurant in town that is cashless.
restaurantowners,feacq58,t1_fea267k,1578947083.0,"The POS creates this Daily Sales Report and at the bottom it has ""expected deposit"" and it'll have a negative value. Honestly I think it's because we give all the tips out in cash but most of them are on credit cards."
CatholicMemes,fe9jdsk,t3_eo4kmp,1578938124.0,Funny although I've never had a good fish stick.
weddingplanning,fe9ek0r,t3_enzwyv,1578936897.0,"I think part of it is these people are just in a totally different income bracket that I am and it's just hard and frustrating. One of the bridesmaids is who asked me when else would I be able to come back up...as if I do it all the time...which I don't.

As it is this wedding is so different than any other wedding I've been to or in. They already told me there are 84 people on the shower invitation list. All the bridal showers I've been to had maybe 30 people there.  HA

&#x200B;

And also because I am married all the costs basically double because we need airfare for 2 people, food for 2 people, hotels can't be shared, etc. etc. Which I knew going into it but yeah it's just things people don't think about. I also don't have PTO so I'm trying to not take a ton of time off work.

My husband is actually the best man so idk what he's going to do for the bachelor party. I bet he ends up not doing anything."
bulletjournal,fe9ceni,t3_eo2l8y,1578936343.0,I found these weekly post-its at staples over the weekend that I'm going to use in a similar way.
ynab,fe99nfe,t3_eo42ck,1578935601.0,"I have an ""interest"" category in ynab more b/c I want to see how much I am earning out of curiosity. So I started YNAB in 2013 and I have over $300 in there which is pretty cool."
bujo,fe6m6so,t3_enu3ik,1578895632.0,I found this sample trello you can copy . [https://trello.com/b/Cczkts0H/sample-bullet-board](https://trello.com/b/Cczkts0H/sample-bullet-board)
bujo,fe6ls0c,t3_enu3ik,1578895196.0,oooh I like that last year I tried digital bullet journaling in the good notes app but it got to be too bulky...but it's hard for me to keep up with a journal/planner.
weddingplanning,fe6lfax,t1_fe6l2f6,1578894830.0,Oh that is a good idea. They did ask if I wanted to be involved in the planning anyway and I might say yes just to see if there's anything I can do from afar.
weddingplanning,fe6le3a,t1_fe6kxch,1578894794.0,yeah and I was able to find flights where I wouldn't need to take any time off work which was a definite plus.
ItalianFood,fe6l7f5,t3_enywaw,1578894602.0,This looks so good
trashy,fe6k4de,t3_eeolp7,1578893520.0,I'VE ACTUALLY heard of brides kicking pregnant bridesmaids out of their weddings. I'm in a wedding in September and might be pregnant...
StAugustine,fe3rnbj,t3_enfj4w,1578852176.0,Yeah my husband won't move so I'm stuck :( and he thinks it's dumb to drive to Jax often it's annoying.
StAugustine,fdz4b2j,t3_el5be7,1578786549.0,I have the same problem n I have a business degree but still can’t find work
unexpectedoffice,fdz3yqn,t3_en3nus,1578786381.0,I just heard on office ladies she was on this show
InclusiveOr,fcpk3qd,t1_fcphak9,1577866116.0,Me lol
StAugustine,fcpjszd,t1_fcov4js,1577865939.0,Yes condos are going for like $200k in some areas it’s insane.
StAugustine,fcpjknh,t3_ei9or1,1577865803.0,No too expensive no jobs n nothing to do at night.
ynab,fcpj1o3,t3_eieamj,1577865505.0,The same thing happened to me last month my credit card payment went through twice. Thankfully I was able to get it reversed. N I have enough buffer to cover it it was more annoying than anything.
ynab,fc7vzul,t3_ecvxkl,1577520088.0,"I just went through everything my goal is always $500 but I spent about $700...but that includes misc decorations I purchased, and supplies for baking. 

Gift giving is my love language though and I’m a sucker for sales.... I end up buying things I’ve needed this time of year bc it’s cheap n I stock up. So there’s probably gifts for myself I should put in my spending money category but just stick it all in Christmas.

I also participated in a secret ornament exchange in an online Facebook group and mailed something once a week for 6 weeks. Nothing extravagant but still another Christmas expense. 

Gift wise I purchased gifts for about 10 people."
ynab,fc7ve04,t1_fbelsav,1577519628.0,Yeah I have to keep Christmas n birthdays separate or it gets too confusing for me
StAugustine,fbfqv13,t3_eczz0w,1576817976.0,There’s a horse tour with Santa n a golf cart tour w the grinch that looks fun.
