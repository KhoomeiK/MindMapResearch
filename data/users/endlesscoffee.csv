gaming,fgjs1d9,t1_fgj1173,1580850266.0,Played original half life using the alt looks keys when the mouse broke. Beat the 3/4 the game like that
todayilearned,fg7679o,t1_fg75c0s,1580584946.0,"Ya I live in the Rockies. I'm used to a lot colder, but the swing is what sucks."
todayilearned,fg6w9oz,t1_fg6vh9n,1580578346.0,Just takes a few  months to get the temp regulation back to normal again. Just takes a while.
todayilearned,fg6uygs,t1_fg6u8c5,1580577472.0,"I never thought it got that cold there, especially compared to the temps I'm from, but it was the 50° temp swings that really got to you. 90f then 2 hours later 40f. Really just made the cold suck the life out of you."
climbharder,ffitvsx,t3_etuep5,1579982600.0,"There's a few different formats of ""periodization"" that you need to be aware of before saying periodized. The first type most athletes have followed is linear which is the classic for most sports; this is what Anderson's could best be described as. It sounds like you've followed something similar to linear in the past. That being said. Linear is difficult for most coaches to get their athletes to peak at. You'll only peak for a period of about two weeks in which you'll probably hit that before your comp. This is why coaches like Bechtel prefer nonlinear periodization. This also works a little better for climbers as we can't necessarily lose endurance, power, or strength, but also allows us to hit the crag on the weekend. I would suggest looking into this and figuring out what works best for your schedule. 
I'd like to type more, but I gotta get packing! I'll try to get on later."
iceclimbing,ffdnn14,t1_ffdn0ot,1579824725.0,"Absolutely. Getting food. Then getting food you can stomach at 10k+ are two separate issues. Was it Anderson that said ""science says oatmeal, but experience says the greasy gas station burger you can get"" obviously paraphrasing."
iceclimbing,ffdmko9,t1_ffdlpau,1579824080.0,Ya I always seem to forget a small bottle of olive oil. Used to add some oil to couscous (classic). I think I like the oreo idea!
iceclimbing,ffdmhtl,t1_ffdlc2r,1579824032.0,Sustaining on the ramen huh? Add oil?
climbharder,ff3v1q6,t3_erhubu,1579549472.0,"I'll preface this by saying I'm more of a traditional/tactical and alpine strength coach rather than climbing focused. Just a quick glance here's my big ones. 
I would remove 2rm and add the standard 3rm and 5rm. Especially in terms of female athletes having a greater potential compared to male athletes for more reps at higher weights. 2rm is really splitting hairs.
Definitely add overreaching with over training.
That's a pretty important distinction to be made. 
I would also add in a distinction between the modalities and what separates them. Example Strength, Muscular Endurance, Power, Hypertrophy.
Overall not a bad list."
climbharder,feb1dz4,t1_feb0ns8,1578954492.0,"There's a lot of research currently happening. Most RDs I've talked to have told me just to buy whatever is cheapest at walmart or wherever. As far as gelatin and OJ go, you have to eat a lot every single day to the point where it's not sustainable."
climbharder,feax2h9,t1_fea4uju,1578953085.0,I had to stop there. As soon as he said collagen I knew it was leading to phisivantage(spelling whatever).

videos,fd6tw4l,t1_fd6iegu,1578195651.0,If I remember correctly the lead plane is there to mark the drop path. I was on that plane a few years back when we were on a fire. Pilots gave me a shirt and I actually was wearing it today!
