I‚Äôve just never known anyone to experience a similar situation in my three years of membership; usually the sister who drops gives her things back on her own accord. It‚Äôs so awkward having to ask someone for a gift back let alone like 20 gifts at once. I think the situation will turn out okay.

You can use a paper clip or bobby pin to push the second one through. My advice would be, the next time you use a bit of paper to send through the tube, don‚Äôt wrap it over the utensil you‚Äôre pushing through. Cut a little strip and place one side over the hole, then take a bamboo skewer (or q-tips, Bobby pens, paper clip etc) and push it into the hole with the paper going in first and the skewer following it.  Or better yet, use cotton instead of paper as it will not rip up and leave pieces as much as isopropyl soaked paper. Personally, I take an alcohol wipe (tiny cotton square) cut it into a really skinny strip, and then push it through so that one end is impaled by the skewer and the rest just follows he skewer down the shaft. Give it a little twist, voila!"
