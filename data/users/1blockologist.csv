Its like when wealthy socialites all of a sudden get embroiled in mud slinging and legal battles after decades of ""polite society"" - just like the college admissions scandals. When one person breaks rank everyone just has to air all grievances to maintain their power, and in the process all sorts of incestuous agreements get revealed.

It doesn't matter that the OMB, GAO, the White House and the democrats in the House found that Trump violated a procedure that a prior Congress had laid out regarding certain types of aid.

It doesn't matter that Former Vice President Joe Biden and now running for President Joe Biden may have been abusing his public office to make it rain in the Ukraine for Hunter Biden along with US Representatives.

Is there a little bit of ""Trump Derangement Syndrome""? I can say that Democrats don't care what Trump is impacted by. People are totally content with an Al Capone type gaff, such as a tax issue. They are chiseling at any angle hoping something sticks, and the House democrats settled on this as soon as it threatened them which turns out to have a lot of long running incestuous agreements between US administrations and Ukrainian administration and corporations.

Is there unnecessary stonewalling on the right? Absolutely.

Is it accurate what the various federal agencies concluded? Absolutely."
