todayilearned,ffzmtqe,t1_ffzm6oe,1580386328.0,"You're right. You absolutely can survive on those insulins, and people did. Of course you can survive with an elevated A1c, it just means you're at a much higher risk for glaucoma, peripheral neuropathy, heart disease....

Blood sugar regulation is a super-complicated balancing act that is affected by all kinds of factors. No two days go exactly the same, and responding to unexpected blood sugar spikes requires fast-acting insulin.

They're not ""easier to use,"" they're *essential* for the current standard of care for diabetes. Mid-acting insulin such as Walmart insulin is an outdated treatment method that makes it much harder to control blood sugar.

The idea that diabetics who want the best care available ""just want things easy"" is a disgusting sentiment. Fuck me for wanting to keep my feet, huh?"
