Your solution to every one of these one off unlikely scenarios is to not secure it at all because, in your eyes, there is always a way around it.

Application control, extension blocking, TLS interception via proxy, EDR, USB lockdown, always on VPN, etc.  All of these provide the ability to prevent 90% of the BS you've mentioned above. 

Finally, if nothing else, the one off case of a user going to an intecepted and uncategorized site that is infected with malware.  At THE VERY LEAST the security team would have visibility over the site accessed, the data exfiltrated and would have the ability to respond appropriately.

You are basically saying ""if you can't secure it to 100% don't bother securing it all.""  If that's your approach a pitty the company you're at."
