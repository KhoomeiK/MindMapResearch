*Any crash you can walk away from wasn't a failure. It was a learning moment and Theoderus Stoneblood, Arch Wizard of the West, learned an important lesson indeed.*

""Okay, flying toilet is a bad idea. Especially around neighbors with scatterguns."" 

*The refuse of the shattered toilet had been gathered by the mud golem and deposited with the other detritus a proper Wizard tends to create. It was a side effect of controlling the cosmos with one's mind.*

*Theo had just sat atop the Flying Carpet with a flagon of ale and a bowl of pipeweed when his Tablet of Sending receive a mystic scroll from Master Brown. It seemed a fellow researcher needed assistance delving into the belly of the world and if there was one thing a Dwarf could do it was to go deep beneath the earth.*

*He accepted the job and failed to notice the strange flavor of his pipeweed. Normally it had an apple flavor but today was more herbal. Almost like Zen had been slipped into the carved pipe.*

""Must be tired from the crash...""

*Theo drifted into the fog of the drug, seeking to chase that phantasmal dragon if you will. All the while a pair of gloves, enchanted to servitude, floated beside the Wizard silently holding the bag that normally held his drugs.*

*The diminutive Dwarf stood still as stone. His left arm, and the small handgun attached to the sliding rail, was still held straight before him. ON the ground was his would-be attacker. He took a deep breath and wiped his right hand down his ugly face. It came away wet with sweat despite the cold Pacific breeze. He had been too busy accepting the job his Fixer, Rowan, had called him about. He had let his guard down, again, and the gang member had snuck up close enough to grab him. To grab his expensive suit!*

*What happened next was a chaotic blur of twisting and kicking, suddenly being free of the thug's grasp and suddenly 'Vigorous Negotiation' had barked two rounds of Stick 'n Shock bullets into the other person.*

""I gotta focus! Aw drek, why wasn't I paying attention!""

*The thief knew someone would eventually come to see what had caused the sudden noise and he really didn't want SFPD to start asking question when he had all these pistols on him. He began to run toward the BART station before catching sight of the downed man's commlink. I mean, it would be criminal to leave such a valuable thing behind...*

*Picket Fence was trying his best to remain calm but the building's edge was mere inches from the toes of his size 52 boots. He raised his arms and looked at the now-deployed wings of the Daedelus suit he wore. THey had worked before so certainly they'd work again. They had to. It was false advertising if they didn't and that was against the law!*

*The huge Troll took a deep breath and forced his feet closer to the edge while snapping down the visor on his helmet. He'd be darned if he let his stupid fear of heights control him!* One more breath and then he'd jump! Of course his Fixer would take that exact moment to message him about the job. Picket Fence mentally typed a terse acceptance and turned back to the edge, unwilling to let something so dumb as heights win. Unfortunately for him Old Dingo's distracting message had kept the Troll from noticing how close he had paced back to the edge while mentally typing. When he turned back, or attempted to at least, he cleanly stepped off of the building and soared.*

*Straight down. He soared straight down with all the aerodynamic grace of a KRIME Brick cyberdeck. He utterly detonated the Jackrabbit that had occupied the parking space beneath his launch pad. He coughed once, twice, and began to pull himself from the wreckage.*

""This job better be worth it. I fraggin' hate heights.""

""Picket, listen. This doc is okay so far as the shadows go but this job is probably going to get, uhh, messy. As in, plastic sheets on the walls kind of messy.""

*Old Dingo looked at the much younger Runner seated across from him. The scenery belied the seriousness of their conversation as the beach was just to one side and a young Ork girl squeezing real oranges into glasses on their other side. Picket Fence was holding his glass of juice up, looking at the rich orange color.*

""Dingo, come on. You've seen me eat barbeque. I can do messy.""

*The two Trolls paid for their glasses of juice and left the table stepping past the armed guards surrounding the juice vendor. CalFree might have all the farms in North America but oranges still weren't cheap.*

JusticeServed,fd6s2zt,t1_fd43ep4,1578195021.0,Wait. Full stop. How do you allege that someone was convicted? Is is an issue of not being able to identify them? Because it's pretty fuckin clear if you've been convicted or not.
PublicFreakout,fd6pop6,t1_fd3zzaw,1578194205.0,I had a big problem with this when I was younger. The rules were there for everyone so why should one prick get to break them when the rest of us abide by them? And then I learned that starting shit with people when I had no authority (other than perhaps moral authority I guess) just made me the killjoy asshole. If it isn't hurting anyone then leave it alone.

Honolulu was a horrible joke when it came to prices. Hawaiian shirt? $170 at the place by the beach. I really want to go there again but I know the memories are better than the reality :("
