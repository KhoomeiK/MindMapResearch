politics,ffin9zt,t3_ettcle,1579977961.0,Nope. No way. I’m a fucking American Public School educated idiot and there is zero chance I would point to Bangladesh if asked to ID Ukraine. Mary Louise Kelly is brilliant and has a fucking Masters in European Studies- I don’t think she’d point to the WRONG GODDAM CONTINENT.

gardening,fezutd2,t3_eqqgcj,1579461942.0,"Depends on where you live and how much of your garden you’re trying to start from seeds. I use fluorescent (not LED) shop lights to grow my seedlings, and the heat from the lights is plenty to get the seeds germinated. If you have something that seriously needs heat to germinate, and  you’re starting them in a cool room, you can set the plants directly on top of the hanging shop lights (picture a porch swing for your seedling trays)- just use a tray under your seedlings so you don’t get water on your lights. I use two two-tube shop lights hung side by side on wire shelves, so it’s plenty wide/deep to sit a standard seeding tray. The heat is just to get things sprouting- once the seed is germinated, most summer garden veggies are ok down to about 55 f, so I don’t directly heat my plants once they’re growing. 

As far as domes, I find them very useful to keep the soil soft and moist during germinating - but I remove them immediately as soon as I see any growth. Too easy to get fungus if you leave the dome on. I’ve actually had better luck with a low fan on my seedlings- ensures the plant stays dry, eliminates fungus gnats, and the slight motion stress makes stronger stems. You just *have to* water at least once a day- better to do it twice. 

I got  my entire setup- two wire shelving units, , 6 x4’ shop lights, and one years worth of trays/cells/ domes for about two hundred. I replace the light tubes every other year, and I have to get new seedling trays every 2/3 years. I used to do OK with seeds, now I have it down to a science and I supply half my neighborhood and my acre yard with veggie starts. 

But starting seeds is sort of my main hobby and passion- so of course I think it’s worth it."

I had always just served them with salad or hummus, hadn’t tried them cooked before. It’s a whole new radish world- sweet, nutty, delicious. You may do that already, just trying to spread the word :)"
