newyorkcity,fffpzvv,t1_fffp5pr,1579889288.0,It's considerably faster with chip/tap nowadays. I guess I've had the opposite experience with people counting out change to pay cash taking forever. An old lady at CVS held up a dozen people the other day fumbling with cash. It was kind of amazing to watch.

newyorkcity,fffdx1z,t1_fffaurs,1579881828.0,"I don't think you can really say prices are solely dictated by demand. These businesses were turning away paying customers who wanted to pay with cash. That almost certainly means that they were operating on pretty thin margins that relied on speed, volume, and lower staff overhead. I'd be pretty surprised if prices didn't go up as a result."
newyorkcity,ffed1nl,t3_et2n1f,1579843595.0,"I understand the reasoning behind this law... wanting to serve the unbanked.

But at the same time cash is a huge pain in the ass for businesses that rely on volume and speed like these lunch spots. I’ve worked in restaurants/retail and dealing with cash just introduces so many additional issues and increases staff time. And that drives up costs which just get passed on to the consumer.

If the city wants to help the unbanked, why don’t they offer banking services? To me, that would treat the root issue."
nyc,ffe3ecj,t1_ffe2ru6,1579835658.0,"That’s a subject of much speculation. I think the simplest explanation is that LBJ wanted power and he saw having firm positions on issues as a liability for a politician. So he said and did anything to get power. He courted the favor of pro-segregation and anti-segregation politicians alike and left both groups thinking he was on their side. He even voted less often than almost any member of Congress in history. But he manipulated the media masterfully to make himself appear very productive.

Once he achieved the power that he wanted, he finally felt freed to use it however he saw fit. He also had immense goodwill on his side after the JFK assassination. He won one of the biggest landslides in electoral history.

Why did he champion civil rights and economic equality? No one really knows. He grew up poor so I’m sure that played a part. He also spent a year teaching poor Mexican-American kids in Texas border towns. That could be partly what made him feel strongly about it.

He’s certainly one of the more complex figures in modern American history, which is probably why there’s been a resurgence of interest in his presidency."

AskReddit,ffdtni4,t1_ffdqau8,1579828643.0,Most people on the left in the US want something closer to the Scandinavian model. A robust and generous social safety net for those who fall on hard times and basic things like healthcare provided for all. You still have to go out and get a job but the government won’t let you starve or be homeless if you can’t for some reason provide for yourself.

nyc,ffcywvz,t1_ffcy273,1579810129.0,"I’m saying that until he became president, LBJ was essentially the same as Cuomo in terms of having no fixed principles.

When LBJ passed all that important legislation, it was a shock to everyone, including his own staff, because he had such a reputation as a fence sitter for his entire career. He had even used his power in the senate to defeat earlier attempts at passing civil rights legislation.

LBJ before and after becoming president are two completely different figures. Before the presidency, he was much more like Cuomo... only interested in accumulating power and winning elections."

Also, after reading the phenomenal biographies of LBJ by Robert Caro, I’d say that Cuomo really reminds me of LBJ.

LBJ’s father was also a very principled politician and who refused to take bribes and had very set ideas about right and wrong. But he couldn’t get very far in politics as a result. LBJ and Cuomo both seem to have seen this as a weakness. They both see winning at all costs as the ultimate goal and have/had no real fixed principles.

nyc,ffcb49e,t1_ffc6i7k,1579795618.0,"What are you basing the ""no lack of shelter space"" thing on?

I used to work in homeless services. Temporary shelters are often available but they're also usually very unsafe. People get robbed and assaulted all the time, so many homeless people avoid them.

Permanent shelter takes a long, long time to get. There are waitlists all over the city. And often when shelter is available, the circumstances make it hard for some homeless people to accept. We had clients with kids who were in school in the Bronx but would get offered a shelter placement in the Rockaways or Staten Island. That's just not a real solution for them.

We really don't have an abundance of shelter space and even the space that is available is often unappealing for several reasons."

personalfinance,ffc7nim,t1_ffbs1sq,1579793418.0,"Yeah I knew someone who went into it purely for the money. 

Money was the only thing she cared about. Wanted a million dollar house and luxury cars. 

She would make fun of her patients to us, calling them ugly and making fun of their bodies.

She also kept failing the certification tests because she really didn’t care about the subject at all, just wanted money.

AskReddit,ffc0hna,t1_ffbnvif,1579788386.0,"Yeah math was always my strongest subject in school. I was skipped ahead 3 years in math and was the highest scoring member of our school’s competitive math team. I think I even set a state record in that math competition but this was decades ago so I’m not sure.

But I just didn’t care about it at all! It’s fun being good at it, I guess, but math just didn’t inspire any real excitement in me. 

Once I got to college, I took the most basic math class to fulfill a requirement and never looked back. And now I’m an English major! Reading and writing is just so much more fulfilling to me, even if it’s more challenging, partly because it’s so subjective. I think I didn’t like how black-and-white math always felt."

nyc,ff9ejiw,t1_ff9cit1,1579711307.0,"What exactly would you have them do? I used to work in homeless services. All that the police did under Bloomberg was sweep the issue under the rug. They just harassed the homeless until they went into hiding in every dangerous nook and cranny they could find. People died walking along subway tracks to get to shelter in the tunnels because it was at least away from the police.

Homeless advocate groups are right to cry foul when the NYPD just uses force to sweep the problem under the rug. It's not a solution and it puts the homeless at greater risk. They're more visible now because they aren't HIDING in dangerous places. That's a good thing for their safety.

So what exactly is your solution?"
Beekeeping,ff83587,t1_ff7zing,1579664739.0,"1) you had mites... every colony has mites unless you’re in Hawaii, Australia, or Cuba.

2) mites are very often the cause behind absconding or collapse of hives so I’m guessing that’s what happened here... mites should be your #1 concern as a beekeeper

3) you’re supposed to feed 2:1 syrup in the fall, not 1:1

Please read up more on beekeeping before buying more bees. Everyone has to monitor/treat for mites. It’s not optional unless you’re in one of those three places I mentioned. And you should feed them the correct syrup. I’m not trying to be a dick but you really need to be more knowledgeable about beekeeping before taking ownership of these living things."
PropagandaPosters,ff82lsa,t1_ff71acs,1579664343.0,"Withholding taxes from people’s paychecks in the US was introduced as a temporary measure during WWII as well.

I have always cringed a bit when I see people who clearly don't care at all. To me, it's about presenting yourself well.
