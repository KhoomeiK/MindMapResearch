NewTubers,fdf0yth,t1_fdegisf,1578350844.0,"I took a look at your latest video it is really well edited with good quality. About the niche I think there is a lot of people doing the same thing especially this year (YouTube was colonized by this reading reddit posts videos ) i'm not saying it's saturated but it's competitive. There is a youtuber (Emkay) who created and started doing this kind of content like 1 year ago (he was late comparing others) he had more than 1 million subs in less than 6 months, So keep going and good luck."
