Firearms,fenemrx,t1_fem16sw,1579283041.0,I have nothing against the “red neck” type gun demonstration videos. But colion’s video are not like those. He’s very well spoken and as a matter of fact about gun laws. And when he is demonstrating a gun he’s never shot before he’s like a kid at Christmas. His videos are just so interesting to watch. He is very versatile too. Ranging from demonstrations to 3 gun to discussion of new anti 2A laws around the country to introducing new shooters that he knows and he has a couple videos about being pro gun and the black community. Just really entertaining.
GunsAreCool,fefeqnf,t1_fefbq3v,1579054761.0,No it shows that existing laws need to be enforced.
GunsAreCool,fef9hju,t1_fef5mpb,1579051343.0,"I am fully aware of what you are saying, but I don’t think you understand what is going on or how hard it actually is to buy a gun legally. The criminals are buying guns through an intermediary. And I agree, if someone buys a gun through an intermediary then uses the gun to commit a crime, yes both should be criminally liable, and in most cases if caught they are. But most of the time if someone buys a gun for someone else they just say it was stolen. But the fact is that someone from Chicago is not going to an Indiana gun shop and buying a gun legally. Someone from Indiana is buying it for them."

They didn’t sell to people with out of state licenses."
GunsAreCool,fef0b2d,t1_feezf21,1579045180.0,"But that’s illegal. Why don’t we just make murder illegal. Then criminals won’t commit murder.

Also your statement is a lie, because you need an address in the local municipality to buy a gun there. They wouldn’t sell you a gun in Ohio if you give them a Chicago address and license."

Trust me when I say this, the first time your child says “I don’t like you” or “ I like mommy better”, it cuts like a dagger. But the 50th time they say it hurts a lot less. I say this so that non-parents know that it’s not just adopted kids that say mean things when they’re mad.

But I’d never want my previous child free life back."
progun,fea2f4e,t1_fe1x561,1578943692.0,"Yes, but when you consider that there are 30k gun related deaths a year and like 65% of those are suicides. Even the lower number of 500k lives saved by defensive use of firearms, they help far more than they hurt."

progun,fdzymuw,t1_fdzxjyn,1578798981.0,"How do you enforce “stricter firearm storage and transport regulations” without infringing on the forth amendment?  I don’t think stricter enforcement of existing law would help. And having gone through the buying process myself, it is way harder than you think, and the “gun show loophole” doesn’t exist. What they’re talking about when they say that, is that a private party sale doesn’t have background checks. And some people might go to a gun show looking to unload some guns they don’t want. That being said, vendors don’t do this and if you sell a gun to a criminal you could be held liable."
progun,fdzrjvp,t1_fdzpus3,1578794131.0,"The shooter was a felon, he didn’t legally own a gun. Gun control laws literally couldn’t have stopped him.

Also, you can’t shoot someone until they start shooting otherwise you’re the murderer."
progun,fdzr1hw,t1_fdxxz4x,1578793830.0,"It’s tough to say how many people are saved by firearms. But if you just brandish it and they flee, that isn’t usually counted unless you call the police afterwards. That being said, the CDC estimates it at 500k to 3 million people saved by defensive use of firearms. And fire extinguishers save 5 million people so yes that is true, but I bet you didn’t know how many people are actually saved by firearms."

ShittyLifeProTips,fdz8r9x,t1_fdytxr7,1578787790.0,"By “encouraging harassment campaigns” do you mean that he, for a period of 1 month, 5 years ago said that sandy hook didn’t happen, so some random listeners took it upon themselves to harass the parents of sandy hook victims. Then after denying sandy hook happened for one month, he retracted his statement and denounced any harassment of victims. So 5 years later all of social media decided to randomly ban him from everything over a period of 2 days. Right as the Epstein story was breaking."

But it did lead to the prohibition of alcohol which lead to the mob takeover of city governments which is still somewhat prevalent today. But 2nd wave feminism which meant well and aimed to get women in the workplace, flooded the workforce, leading to us actually needing 2 incomes to afford a house. So both 1st and 2nd wave feminism had good parts and bad parts. But I agree that 3rd wave feminism is a dumpster fire."
