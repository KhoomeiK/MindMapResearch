It would be similarly easier for companies to not bother with environmental regulations or safe food handling methods. The government restricts behaviors of companies that are damaging or potentially damaging to the general public.

Frankly, we've already had similar fights over ""company script"" where companies had been trying to pay people partially or entirely in gift cards to their business.

Guy buying (p1) now must go to bank (party 3) to give money to guy selling (p2), who will then deduct the same amount of money from (p1). For this service bank (p3) charges guy selling (p2) for the equipment/license to do business and charges fees to guy buying (p1), sometimes only when they settle up longer than 30 days afterwards and sometimes on a monthly basis.

Going cashless can make logistics easier inside guy selling's company because they don't have to store cash or trust their employees to handle cash, but it requires adding an extra hoop to jump through in the transaction that get someone unnecessarily paid.

1) Animal scavengers disinter shallowly buried remains. There are a lot of animals that will eat corpses and can dig. In order to remain undisturbed the body must be deeper than the animals can feasibly reach.

If a corpse can be happened across by someone who carelessly touches it and doesn't wash their hands then a lot of the bacteria that help break down dead bodies can cause disease in live ones. It was one of the reasons why hospitals were terrible in the nineteenth century, doctors often touched corpses and the living patients without washing up which caused a ton of unnecessary deaths. A shallow grave often ""washes out"" exposing disease-spreading body parts in ways that aren't necessarily immediately recognizable.

If you care about the dead not being ripped apart by animals or care about the living not dying because someone didn't bother to dig a deep enough hole then six feet is the about the shallowest you can get and be reliably safe.

AskReddit,ffen5za,t1_ffeeen9,1579855431.0,"In 1983 the Soviet Novosti Press Agency sent out a press release blatantly denying that there was a famine at all. Virtually none of the documentation of he famine were publicly available until the opening of the Archives as part of Glasnost. Three successive heads of the Central Soviet Statistical Administration were arrested in conjunction with the 1937 census and their inability to cook the books to make the demographics of Ukraine match claims made by Stalin and others, the 1939 data was simply ripped from Stalin's notes of what they should be and no further censuses occurred until 1959 (seven years after Stalin's death).

Contemporaneously, in 1932 Molotov claimed that it was a Polish attempt to destabilize the region and criminalized mention of the ""plot"" with a 5 year gulag stint, but to just turn back people from the area who were looking to get food elsewhere for themselves or their families, records indicate that some 200,000 people were turned back. In 1933 the Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov outright stated that there was no famine and the offers of aid that came after foreign media reported on it were fabricated and a wholly cynical attempt to make themselves look good by providing aid when no disaster exists. In 1934 Litvinov said that the population had been increasing by 2% a year since the fall of the Tsarist regime, which was largely in line with Stalin's invented numbers.

Rapid industrialization was certainly a part of it, but Ukraine wasn't the only region to be hard hit by famine in 1932 and 1933. For example 40% of all Kazakh people also died over those years as their grain stores were requisitioned to offset bad harvests elsewhere. Unlike the 1921-22 famine which was clearly the result of a drought, there was no widespread drought or flooding that would make an obvious environmental cause.

It looks like the famine in the vast majority of the areas was a direct result of a mix of government policy. In most of the areas in question the government response was to blame the peasants and truck in food from elsewhere. That food had to come from somewhere and it seemed that Ukraine and Kazakhstan got the short end of that particular stick.

It is similar to famines under British rule, where authorities claimed to have failed to implement protocol to mitigate the effects of famine, such as the Bengali Famine of 1943 and the Irish Potato Famine. The removal of food from the area for other purposes took a bad situation and made it an utter disaster. The authorities in those cases did not intentionally trigger the famine but their actions were blatantly criminal and were directly responsible for millions of deaths that were avoidable. Government policy that makes famines deadly aimed at a specific minority groups must necessarily be genocide and it's not a unique thing to the Soviet Union. Although, it did happen disturbingly often in the early Soviet Union while they tried to impose an unrealistic mode of agriculture that they were developing from scratch on a largely unenthusiastic rural population."

Land, labor, and capital. You can't hammer a nail if you have no wood or iron. You can't hammer a nail without a worker. You might be able to hammer a nail with a rock, but then all you did was turn rock into capital so you might as well use a hammer or nail gun or something.

People should be able to pay people to fix problems for them. The fuck are you smoking. The problem isn't that commodities exist and that work is one of them. The problem you've been talking about this whole time is imbalanced political, social, and economic power.

Even in those so-called ""communist"" regimes you love so much labor is exploited by an elite who horded political, social, and economic power to solve their problems for them.

That's not even remotely accurate. 76% of American Workers have 401(K). The average worker absolutley has exactly what I was talking about. Sure, young people at their first jobs are down near 50% and Boomers have the highest rates, but that's just to be expeced.

Chavez ran and won because the people were deeply unhappy with how little of the sovereign wealth fund from all the oil revenue was actually reaching them. Chavez promised to spend much of the money on the average person. He followed through on that.

For a bit there he was alright. When he started giving away oil for political power, funding FARC and other leftist rebels, and looted the fuck out of the state oil company was when things started going bad, but the worst bit was the failure to diversify like Norway or the UAE did and Saudi Arabia is trying now.

Even when trying to measure the subjective social value so much of the literature about Labor Theory of Value just ends up correlating wages with themselves using circular reasoning. 

So much of the value of both the labor and the end products come from the consumer that, again, *at best* Labor Theory of Value only deals with half of the problem.

If workers had control of the voting rights of the shares they already own they could completely remake the boards of all of them in a matter of a couple of years, and restructure the corporations in a matter of a couple of decades.

If everyone is a neo-feudal lord then no one is. If everyone has power then power must be democratic. The idea is to flatten the pyramid, but if everyone owns their own capital then everyone is down to exploiting themselves (and maybe robots and computers) rather than other humans.

But as long as there are few of them it's super easy for them to have class consciousness and super hard for the general mass of humanity to.

Besides, after ""eating the rich"" all that ends up happening is a new, revolutionary ruling class taking over because the fundamentals for a post-scarcity economic and social order weren't in place and positions of power and wealth are asshole magnets of the highest order. I would rather diffuse wealth and power before moving against those who break the rules to rule petty kingdoms.

The lack of reinvestment in the general economy and the replacement of apolitical technicians with their buddies took a while to show, and then when the soaring price of oil didn't cover it any longer (a similar thing happened to the USSR, actually) it all went to shit. The sanctions didn't start until later. And the US didn't stage that coup, the most it did was not tell Chavez and said mildly positive things at a press conference.

At the end of the day, profits can and often are shared with employees. Today more than 36% of American workers participate in profit sharing, and doing so has been tax advantaged since 1956.

Okay. But that just means that you are making up the rules to the game and not telling me first. That's not a way to get honest debate. That's a way to massage your own ego.

At the end of the day, capitalism is simply defined by private ownership of property, markets, and relatively like government intervention. If you have government-run companies working ""on behalf"" of the workers then that isn't capitalism. ""State Capitalism"" is simply communists complaining that other communists did it wrong, since the government isn't actually workers.

Employee owned corporations, depositor owned banks, and the like exist just fine in the US today. Credit Unions are significant, one of the major supermarket chains around here is entirely employee owned, and Co-ops utterly dominate the rural economy. This is just as capitalistic as anything else. Corporations **ARE** a way for a group of people to collectively own property and still have it be private property. It's just a group of people working together to a purpose. The hoarding of wealth by a few is a function of corporations being badly designed and implemented, rather than a structural feature. The difference between Publix and Kroger doesn't show up to the average consumer despite Publix being an example of an employee owned corporation.

Inequality absolutely needs managing. It's a problem. But the problem isn't going to be solved by relying on he flat earth theory equivalent called the Labor Theory of Value. The answers are relatively simple, break up the monopolies (particularly in the media, banking, and tech giants), encourage a healthier mix of styles of corporation, encourage new business formation to increase the size and decrease the class consciousness of the wealthy, simplify regulatory apparatus and prohibit companies from writing the regulations that govern them, and make the leveraged buy out illegal.

worldnews,fen827l,t1_fen39kj,1579279013.0,"There are a couple of different reasons.

The first is trade police. The relative value of currency has an impact on exports. If the currency is ""cheap"" then it encourages exports if a currency is ""expensive"" then it makes it hard for people in foreign countries to buy things denominated in it. Remember currencies have their own supply and demand curves, so you can give up more stuff denominated in your home currency than you could get after it has been converted into a foreign currency and used to buy the same sort of stuff there. Generally speaking, southern European nations like Greece, Italy, and Spain had ""cheap"" currencies to encourage exports and Germany, France, and the UK had ""expensive"" currencies that are most beneficial for large internal markets. As people adopted the Euro it achieved a compromise status where it's not cheap enough for one camp and too cheap for the other, whereas the UK has been able to adjust the value of the Pound as needed without any intervention.

Giving control over monetary policy to an international body represents a sacrifice of significant control over your own economy. I don't know if you've heard about the US Federal Reserve, but if they upped and moved to Brussels then the US' capacity to handle issues like unemployment indirectly would be severely compromised.

Then there's the fact that monetary policy (IE, messing with the value of the currency) is an effective way of handling large amounts of national debt. When governments issues bonds they issue it for a nominal amount. As inflation happens, the amount of stuff that one must give up to reach that nominal amount decreases making repaying the debt cheaper. So, a regular amount of inflation makes debts of all kinds easier to pay off, which is why most developed nations have an inflation target of around 2%. Because it makes their national debt 2% cheaper to pay off every year.

That said, there are clear advantages as well, and those nations that don't generally handle their currencies well and get locked into a political-business cycle benefit the most. A political-business cycle is when a government in power prints extra money, gives business loans, or just spends a bunch in the run up to an election so that they can campaign on how well the economy is at the moment, and then they cut back on it after they have won which creates a recession as the artificial pumping up of the economy returns to ""normal"". Then they rinse/repeat every future election cycle. It doesn't seem harmless, until you factor in that the extra spending/damage to the currency comes at the expense of healthy long term growth and public services (artificially inflated currency *kills* people on fixed incomes). Then the rapid market crashes every 4-8 years puts a lot of businesses permanently out of business if they get big loans to expand, keeping them artificially smaller and weaker than competitors from neighboring countries.

The ""natural"" business cycle causes real harm and should be moderated by government, not exacerbated by it, so taking the power away from politicians that exploit market cycles for temporary political benefits and giving it to a much larger body of politicians that don't benefit from regularly crashing the economy works out way better in the long run. Since the UK has used its currency to manage debt well and doesn't have a political-economic cycle I don't think that they benefit nearly as much as most when it comes to possibly adoption the Euro."

On Main Street most options are on the pricier side. An exception to this is Columbian Bites. It's an interesting cuisine that we don't normally get and the price is certainly right. It's at the north end of Main Street right across from Moon Station. On the southern end of that drag there is Pisano's, which is very solid neighborhood New York Style pizza, and again it's not on the same level price wise as the Trackside or anything. It's also important to note that SuBourbon's, the bar next to the thrift shop, actually has seafood and makes a solid majority of its income on that instead of drinks, it wasn't the owner's plan but he's leaned into it a bit. Don't forget the Jamaican place as well, though that's a bit spicier than what I'm used to.

As you travel away from Main Street on Cherokee there are a couple of interesting option. The Frozen Cow is first, and a solid place to get a desert, they use liquid nitrogen to freeze a sweet cream to make a somewhat unique desert. The Nest is really on trend, a good mix of interesting drinks and good barbecue. There's a Venezuelan place in the gas station mini-strip mall on the right just past Ben King. If you like the Columbian place then the Venezuelan place is similar but with a different set of dishes. Then there's the Kennesaw Smoke House, which is a better pure barbecue place than the Nest but doesn't have the feel or the complimentary drinks. In the Kroger Shopping center at the corner with Frey there's an Indian place and a good sit down Chinese place, as well as a cheaper sit-down Hibachi place that's never steered me wrong. There's a real chap old school southern buffet called Donny's just past where Frey dead ends into Cherokee, which is good if you want a lot of decent food.

Outside that core area there are a couple that I haven't seen mentioned. My favorite Teriyaki/Sushi place is Kuroshio's on Barrett. When it comes to Korean it depends if you want to take out or eat in. The Iron Age let you cook the barbecue yourself on the table which works real well as an event place, whereas Il Mee on Cobb Parkway half way to Marietta is a truly authentic experience. There's a pretty neat fast food take on the hibachi concept over on Canton Road called Moon's Chicken and Wings.

After all, early America inherited England's distaste for Catholicism and the German Empire was just Prussia 2.0 after it had absorbed the rest of Germany, while Germany at the time was slightly majority Catholic the ruling elite was heavily Protestant since the Catholic elite ended up mostly in Austria (which is still Germans not in Germany) and Bavaria (the last bit to join up).

bestof,fdxjdqo,t1_fdwztp5,1578769224.0,"That depends on the situation, and I'm not entirely certain how it applies here.

The first and easiest is to take two distinct sets of elites and play them off one other. Historically, there was a lot of tension between the King and the Aristocracy, in some countries the Aristocracy had basically all the power and in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth they elected the kings. In others the King had all of the power and the only way that the lesser nobility had a share of power and prestige was by earning offices that had power delegated from the King. The relatively powerless peasants and merchant classes generally threw their weight behind whomever was less oppressive to them and they won exemptions from taxes, being drafted, or other specialized privileges. By the time the 1700's came around they had been so successful at winning these special exemptions that it was a major contributing factor to the collapse of the old monarchies of Europe.

In a more modern context, if you have separate political elites or a distinction between an economic and a political elite then the same basic methods can be employed. Give one group temporary power at the expense of the other. This is, roughly, the idea behind parties where they actively compete for said favor but as people have become less willing to shift their weight that system has become harder to operate and the gross mismanagement of both parties has damaged their appeal. There have been between six and eight major party realignments where one or both major parties collapsed and was reformed in US history, I would like to see another and soon.

If balancing the existing elites isn't an option then realigning them is another. There are always institutions designed to benefit those who have already made it, and there is always a tendency among those who made it to defend themselves by slamming the door shut behind them. That's precisely what Tokugawa Ieyasu did, during the wars that allowed him to rise tot he top and some of his major allies/rivals to emerge from the peasantry to being major lords in their own right he froze status everyone in the social and political status they had at that moment to protect the new order. Similar things happened with the Robber Barons of America's period of rapid industrialization. Those who built businesses and raised their status immediately sought legal protection and shut down others who were trying to emulate their rise to prominence through a mixture of crime and economic trickery. The solution is to prevent the closing of those opportunities. The more people who are wealthy/powerful then the harder it is for them to coordinate. Enough people of that status and the existing power blocks will split until there are enough to be played against one another, or the ""new rich""/""new powerful"" will form an entirely new elite that will force realignment.

A great opportunity is with a relatively new concept known as a ""business incubator"". Most of the time new businesses fail because their owners don't have the experience and training, but also because they aren't well connected enough to bring in help to cover their weaknesses. Business incubators are generally non-profits associated with university business programs that provide training and connections to people founding businesses that greatly increase their odds of success. The graduates of these programs often turn around and help up the next class, which can greatly improve the local economy around them and defang the sometimes pernicious impact of venture capital on new business formation.

If you can't build up an elite, then sometimes posing a threat can give a good negotiation position. Having a threat that can be reasonably executed and being willing to give up that threat in exchange for concessions is key. In a relatively open and free of corruption environment, this means monkeying with institutions. While some people suggest that the threat of violent revolution or communism can function in this role, I don't really believe it. A violent revolution is so unlikely that it can be safely discounted and communism is just a bad idea.

What is a potentially good idea to force compliance among the business elite is simple. Retirement investing. The stake of Amazon held by Bezos and the stake of Microsoft held by Gates are simply dwarfed by the amount owned by Vanguard, Fidelity, and Transmerica. Retirement investors already own majorities or significant minorities of all major publicly traded companies. These institutional investors have immense latent power to change the very structure and nature of business. They could, if they wanted to, turn over the board and fire all the C-suite executives in about a year. They could force the restructuring of most corporations into employee-owned business or nonprofits or any number of other things. They don't because, well why would they.

In that range there are no meaningful ill effects, disemployment doesn't start happening until you get above 1/2 the median wage and it has little impact on rent or inflation until that range as well.

So, in the entire US it would be relatively low. But, the various states that have higher cost of living should set it to their lowest median wage, so as to have the higher floor for much of the state but not hose the struggling areas too much. Cities should have a higher minimum wage of even that because cities have both a higher median wage *and* a higher cost of living than rural or suburban areas.

I wouldn't be surprised if $15/HR would be a reasonable minimum wage for a handful of pockets in the US like New York City and San Francisco, but for much of the country it's completely insane and its implementation would result in discrediting the very concept of a minimum wage being harmless."

AdviceAnimals,fdnur07,t1_fdnt7fn,1578593243.0,"If people decide to eat less mean then you aren't restraining demand, that's just demand shifting naturally. Fewer people wanting to eat meat or people wanting to eat less meat means that they would buy less meat at any price. That is to say demand falls, and both the price and quantity of meat falls. Less demand for meat means less demand for the precursors of meat, that is to say less demand for cows, chicken, pigs, sheep, and cultivated fish and oysters. Resulting in lower income for farmers who specialize and fewer animals being maintained.

""Consumer preference"" is the term, since it reflects a reordering of what people truly want. ""Collective self restraint"" assumes that people still want to consume the same amount of meat, but are prevented from doing so for whatever reason.

The point of the original comment was:

""I continue to eat meat because if no one were to eat meat then these animals would go extinct"".

This is, largely speaking, true. Domestic animals are maintained by demand for them. Releasing them into the wild without first tailoring them to a new ecological niche would be disastrous to them, the environment, or both. So, it is highly probable that a sudden collapse in demand for animal products would result in the extinction of farm animals, similar things have happened to specific breeds of farm animal in the past. Thus, if you want to prevent the extinction of farm animals then consuming a moderate amount of responsibly sourced animal products would be a solid way to ensure the continued existence of those animals independent of the overall trends of society.

* Without a means of paying their upkeep or safely abandoning them into a wild environment where they could thrive the next most logical step would be to euthanize them or to prevent new births, resulting in a crippling collapse of biodiversity in the species and eventual extinction.
