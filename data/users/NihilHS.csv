heroesofthestorm,ff6a3lw,t3_erv1nd,1579622664.0,"It's funny to me that people will argue until they're blue in the face about how cool it is that HotS is team based on forums/reddit, but then you get in game and you see people bitching about low damage on one hero (or the ""I'm a support and I have the highest damage"").

It can't be both ways.

The reality is that execution of micro in this game is relatively easy (compared to LoL and DotA). If a particular hero is under performing in your game, it's *possible* the pilot is just garbage, but it's far more *plausible* that either his/her team isn't enabling them or the match up is terrible for them.

Think of it like this: no matter how good you are at kael thuzad, you'll consistently do more damage in draft modes than in quick match. Why? Because KT needs to be close to the action but he also needs to be protected. If you don't have a comp that can support that, you're just going to get smashed and do no damage. It drives me nuts when I see QM KT's either get flamed OR they talk about how bad they are with KT and how they need to improve. No, you need peels."
heroesofthestorm,fev6kaw,t1_feudjwa,1579393681.0,">So what if one person can't carry the game?

It's a must for competition, but only if that player is significantly stronger than the others in a lobby. It absolutely should *not* be arbitrary. HotS doesn't *have* to do anything, but it would be much more popular if it shifted towards a more competitive philosophy, or to be more precise, if it stayed the same but gave competitive players a queue that had more traditional moba mechanics or had a higher skill cap.

>but that doesn't mean HotS should emulate these games for two reasons:

Don't take my argument to an extreme. You originally brought up LoL and DotA. I'm not saying HotS should copy LoL and DotA.

>The people who are interestedin these mechanics already play these other games.

Unlike you, I think HotS in many ways is *superior* to LoL and DotA. What's holding it back is that it isn't competitive enough. Somehow your argument seems to suggest that if HotS started to become more competitive and thus more like DotA and LoL, it would be an inferior version of DotA/LoL. I strongly disagree. The thing keeping more people from playing HotS and continuing to play it is that it isn't competitive enough.

>I don't play the game to be completely overpowered by one character. That's not an enjoyable concept for me.

And that's totally fine. The game as it is now appeals to you then, does it not? What about the competitive players? I'm not saying the game should change, I'm saying they should make a mode for more competitive players rather than ignore them. That's my entire point. That's why I made the analogy with DotA and LoL's ""light"" queues (turbo, nexus blitz). The main game in LoL and DotA appeals to a more competitive player, but LoL and DotA *also* *have queues* that exist for more casual players. HotS lacks this equivalent. There is no staying power for more competitive players because HotS has not given them a place to play. Simply giving the form of competitive play (with a draft and rank etc) without the substance is insufficient."
heroesofthestorm,feu6gtx,t1_fetygk2,1579383573.0,">Isn't that the point of ranked

In form but not substance. For example, let's say I make a website that allows you to play 1 vs 1 coin flipping against other users. I could have a ""free play"" mode that doesn't track your stats, and a ""ranked"" mode that gives you an elo and modifies it based on the outcome of your games. I could have a ladder, ranked tournaments, prizes, etc. While this ranked mode appears to be more competitive, the issue is that the game itself (coin flipping) is inherently not competitive. No matter how much I dress it up or make it look like its competitive, coin flipping simply cannot be a competitive game.

Note I'm *NOT* saying HotS is like coin flipping, I'm just giving an extreme example to articulate what my argument is.

>This seems like you just want to play LoL or Dota with HotS characters.

I have a few responses:

Firstly, the market has spoken. To argue that a suggested change seems like a trait belonging to a more successful game, or to argue that one should ""Just go play the other game"" when our game is circling the drain seems dubious to me. Ironically the suggestion is precisely the problem. People *are* playing those other games instead of HotS.

Secondly, It's entirely possible that HotS incorporates more individual centric mechanics while maintaining its team focus. Not everything is black and white.

Finally, my suggestion isn't to change the game itself, but to give a different mode/way of playing the game/queue that is more appealing to hardcore and competitive moba players. I wouldn't want HotS as it is to go away, in fact I think it's one of the best casual games out there. There absolutely *should,* however, be a space for competitive freaks to play. Not just in form, but in substance too."

heroesofthestorm,fesm4mm,t1_fere3ua,1579366684.0,"I'd say go even further. We don't need a new shiny, and we don't need bug fixes. We need a place for intense competitive gamers to enjoy themselves. DotA and LoL each have a ""light"" mode. HotS needs a ""hard"" mode to supplement its main game.

We need a mode with more traditional moba mechanics with a higher skill ceiling. People play mobas because they want to level *themselves* up. They want to study or practice to improve. They want to be able to crush the folks that were previously destroying them in lane.

HotS doesn't facilitate this. It is never about you outplaying someone else. It's about you playing well with your team. Other mobas have this *in addition* to a greater individual impact. **This is what is holding hots back**. No amount of polish or new heroes will change that."
nihilism,fepf1wb,t1_feoglnk,1579318890.0,"I'd instead focus on being a happy human being, which is probably the thing you're actually after by wanting to be an ""optimistic nihilist."" Sure the things you desire in life may be pointless, but if both misery and happiness are equally meaningless, why not pursue the latter? Surely it's preferred?

Pursue the things in life that make you happy and give you a great sense of purpose, even if you consciously accept that there is no such purpose. It's the *sense* of it that you truly desire, anyway.

The greater issue for some (I would predict younger folks/teenagers, not necessarily you) is that they choose to be nihilists because they need a sense of identity. They want to be edgy and dark, and they want to be seen being edgy and dark. While that's totally fine, it runs the risk of manufacturing depression for the sake of cognitive consonance. IF you call yourself a nihilist as a means of establishing self-identity, be sure to admit to yourself that the point is to fulfill your desire of having such an established identity and no more."

Perhaps that isn't satisfactory to a pessimist, but I don't think nihilism is inherently pessimistic (in that regard). Consequently I have to agree with jackrunit above. The attachment of values to the concept and to therefore arrive at either pessimism or optimism is not an attribute of nihilism but a mechanic of human cognition. In other words, one could be a nihilist and also be optimistic, pessimistic, or neither. The emotional response you have doesn't have much to do with nihilism itself.

It *might* be true that there is a tendency for pessimism with nihilists, but from the perspective of nihilism, neither pessimism nor optimism is preferred."

I totally agree with this. My reference to self reports of QoL isn't to indicate what the individuals who reported's QoL *actually* is, but rather their perception of it. That's more or less the point, to highlight the discrepancy between the grossly different QoL around the globe despite consistent reports of QoL. 

An overly simplified example to illustrate the concept is this: If a homeless person finds $100 on the street, he'd be very happy. If a billionaire found $100 on the street, he may be pleased, but perhaps not quite as happy as the homeless person. Ok so they have different motivating operations. But what if a homeless person finds $100 on the same street at [6.am](https://6.am) every day for two weeks, and then on the 15th day finds only $10? That might be quite annoying.

I have never heard of this, but maybe this is new research? I finished my degree in psych several years ago so maybe something is different.

From what I understand, we make attributions relative to our previous experiences. Consequently you see similar scores on self reported quality of life around the globe, despite obvious differences in actual QoL.

When I started out, I spent a lot of my chess time studying books on strategy, and didn't study nearly enough tactics. This wasted a lot of time and effort. I erroneously thought chess was more knowledge than skill. As a beginner, you really should focus on improving your *skill* at the game (if your objective is to become stronger as efficiently as possible).

I also made the mistake of waiting to start tournament chess. As a 20 y/o, I didn't want to go to my first tournament and get romped by children. This essentially let my pride get in the way of my improvement.  In hindsight, that was a massive mistake. Let me tell you, no matter how strong you get, you'll still get romped by children. It happens, and it's actually really cool. And playing a lot of tournament chess is probably the best way to improve. 

Just remember: In chess, you are always succeeding if you're learning. Don't obsess over ratings or results. You win some, you lose some, your rating goes up and down. You're always winning if you're always learning and enjoying yourself. 

When I was at my first plateau at 1400, I was convinced that there was some secret stronger players were keeping from weaker ones. I vowed to myself that, when I finally learned the secret, I would spill the beans and share it with everyone. I've come to find out that there is no secret, but my desire to help other players hasn't gone away. If you need any help or advice, don't be afraid to reach out.
