On the nights I was all alone, I would find tomatoes that rolled from the produce section all the way into the middle aisle where the gloves and cooking utensils are now. Other times I would be buffing and Lunchables would launch themselves from the display onto the floor right in front of me. Supposedly a guy had a heart attack in the store a number of years ago."

I am also capable of grabbing my own beer from the fridge and I never saw myself trying to populate a farm or family business with slave labor. 
I need no one to worship me nor do I think having children would fill that metaphorical hole in my heart."
AskReddit,fe5swks,t3_enuzc3,1578874224.0,"Check with your dentist to see if you have gingivitis. I had treatment-resistant depression for a couple of decades. Of all the meds I took, nothing helped. Most drugs, like SSRI's made things worse. Therapists used to tell me that I secretly did not want to get better.  

Had all my teeth removed in 2014. I started noticing a few months later, that my recurrent suicidal ideation and days where I couldn't get out of bed was gone, completely. It took me 3-years to stumble upon the reason why. Found out there's a shit-ton of research papers on the correlation between gum disease and depression.

It's not just bad teeth that can have this effect. A leaky gut can give the same results. Basically any source of long-term inflammation"

TwoHarborsMinnesota,fdgk528,t3_elap60,1578399990.0,"The reason I bring this subject of absentee ownership up is due to the apartment I live in. Until six months ago, the building I live in was owned by a gentleman in Duluth. Repairs requests were ignored for all but the most critical of services. The roof is missing so many shingles when it rains outside, it rains in my living room closet. I have thought about filing a complaint with the proper authorities but I'm afraid the place will be condemned and I'll be out on my ass, with nearly zero options for lateral transfer into a new place. I have heard that other rental properties suffer from the same syndrome."
TwoHarborsMinnesota,fdgjkad,t3_elap60,1578399387.0,"In the year this sub has operated, I have seen 3 or 4 Granite Gear press releases pop up. They always have a Two Harbors dateline, yet in the 18-years I have lived here, I didn't know even Granite Gear existed for the first 14 of those years.  

I now know they operate out of two buildings and provide stable employment to more than a handful of people. But I never see the company name come up on the liquor store electronic billboard's community events scroll (best source for what's going on IMO). Maybe I need to get out into the community more, but there seems to be an odd disconnect between the tone of their press release and their near-ghost-like nature here in town.  

I'm most likely wrong about this. Can someone set me straight?"

Marched into my local branch and asked for an explanation. Was told it was my fault due to errors in my checkbook balancing routine. Tried to explain that I had purposely refrained from making any purchases for a three-week period. Had ATM account balance receipts for each day from their ATM. Branch manager tried to tell me that a $127.00 drop in funds available and then sudden recovery was due to 'holds' placed on 5-week old grocery store purchases
