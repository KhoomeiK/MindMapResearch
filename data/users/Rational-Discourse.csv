news,fffrhrf,t1_fffocs4,1579890213.0,"Due respect, I’m not sure of your experience in the practice of law... I’ve prosecuted cases. And you’re not “innocent until proven guilty.” That’s a fun pop phrase. But really, it’s that you’re “not guilty” until proven “guilty.” Innocence is not a legal standard that criminal courts determine. The law recognizes that you may have factually committed a crime where you cannot be proven guilty in a court of law. That’s why you can successfully sue someone for wrongful death in civil court even if you can’t be proven guilty in a criminal court of law. 

*See*: O.J. Simpson being found at fault for the death of his wife and Ron Goldman in a civil court. 

So he isn’t innocent until proven guilty. He’s just not criminally liable/guilty until proven guilty. A jury verdict doesn’t magically change factual reality. I know that you aren’t suggesting that. What I’m saying is that under the presented circumstances, it isn’t necessarily wrong to call him a rapist. It may even be factually correct. You just can’t call him a convicted rapist.

It isn’t best practice to say he’s a rapist, and I personally wouldn’t be quite as emphatic or definitive in such assertions. But at the same time, I wouldn’t draw such a hard line - that until a court of law calls someone guilty, you can’t conclude that someone did it. Courts can get it wrong. Evidence can be lost. Juries led astray. Police can bungle chain of custody. Judges and lawyers are fallible.

Again, I think this thinking is equally problematic to thinking that says “you have to believe all accusers no matter what.” Both are problematic extremes."
news,fff9j77,t1_ffexsgc,1579879040.0,"I see what you’re saying about the other commenter, but I would counter that there’s a fine line between pointing out statistical data that supports the notion that you shouldn’t blanket-believe every accuser in all circumstances, period, and being an apologist for rapists. It’s good that people should want a level of proof before someone is declared a rapist and taken as a fact. Hell, murderer almost has a nicer connotation than rapist. False accusations, while far from the norm, has ruined lives and does, in fact, happen.

Why I want a level of proof or consistency before drawing a conclusion: much of the data on false accusations comes prior to a major cultural movement that has made coming forward with accusations a statement of power, pride, and resiliency. By no means do I mean that in a negative connotation. But society has shifted from maligning or disbelieving accusers to celebrating them coming forward. Many people, television and film, and trending social media content view victims who come forward as tragic and/or inspiring heroes. On one hand, this is good. If it gives victims courage to come forward, that’s awesome. But data that tracks false accusations often comes from a time where there were many socially negative consequences to coming forward, valid or false accusations. There are less negative social consequences, now, with some calling for all accusers to be believed. Period.

As I would never jump to conclusions of guilt without some degree of proof, at the very least, I would never jump to negative conclusions about an accuser. But I do fear that a rise in genuine accusations will correlate, at least to a small degree, to a rise in false accusations. Why? I look to a separate issue: we saw a rise in suicide, especially teen suicide, after social awareness and, in a perverse way, social currency became tied to the tragic faces of suicide. There are several factors that could distinguish the two scenarios, but, as a society, we concluded that idealizing the faces of suicide was a dangerous move by society that had both fortunate and unfortunate consequences. While it brought to light a huge problem, it also saw a correlating increase in threats and acts of suicide. Many people attributed this to a reckless romanticization of suicide. I understand the distinction between rape accusations and suicide but I see similarities to a social issue, commentary on which ranged from “swept under the rug” to vilified, shifting in the public perspective.

That being said, while I would probably slightly be even more skeptical about a celebrity accusation without more proof - the fact that so many people have come forward with accusations is pretty convincing that there is some validity. A lone, unfounded accusation? Yeah, I’m skeptical. Multiple accusations that reflect a pattern? I’m less hesitant to draw conclusions. I think that where the other commenter gets it wrong is drawing a hard line at “I need proof. Period. No other scenario would allow me to believe otherwise.”  Not only does this, ironically, mirror/create an opposite but equal problem to “I never need proof. I believe them. Period” mentality - it ignores the statistically unlikely scenario of multiple, unrelated accusers coming forward with seemingly no benefit to gain."
interestingasfuck,ffcobpw,t1_fdfcjys,1579803725.0,"While I agree with your premise - forcing someone’s hand in your death, making them a part of that death, is pretty particularly selfish.

But, then, most suicide scenes run the risk of causing PTSD. Your family has to find your hanging/slit wrist,
/overdosed body/shot/etc. gruesome body? That’s a lifetime of mental scarring.

A cop has to walk into a scene where someone blasted the top of their head off? That’s a lifetime of potential mental scarring.

Say they don’t do it at home, but rather at a hotel/motel. Some housekeeping employee is going to have a very bad day. And potentially a lifetime of mental scarring.

There’s very few methods I can think of that doesn’t require someone to be faced with the unintended consequences of your actions."

todayilearned,ffae1e8,t1_ff9gmgh,1579733395.0,"Honestly, though, it sounds like a Nora Efron movie. I could see the bumbling antics of old man, presented maybe in a softer light of loneliness/midlife, post divorce crisis rather than malice. He’s trying to navigate computers and keep up the lie to comedic effect. Then your head in the stars young girl too interested in finding love to notice the red flags. Tell their stories, and the ensuing antics, side by side, until confrontation - then meeting and portray the conflicting perspectives. One feels betrayed and foolish. One feels embarrassed and ashamed.

And that sets up the second act where they try, unsuccessfully to kindle something from nothing. Kind scenes turn to awkward. They drift apart. Thus inspires her quest to find the real “Ronnie” aka Adem. She meets him and starts a real romance while Alan gets edged out. Meanwhile, news stories run with the cat fishing.

Third act hits where she meets adem and covers their own relationship while the fallout for Alan’s actions hits. Alan is ridiculed or shamed by family, friends and coworkers. Throw in some hard lessons he learns from the repercussions of his lies to keep his portrayal from being TOO nice. Throw in some canned monologues about lying, the digital age, *who we are* vs who we say we are. Then end the story with her being picked up by her new love from work (in front of her caring/doubting work friends). And also ends where Alan moves to some small village to get away out of shame... where he meets a new love, but this time as himself. He’s learned to love himself and let others try to love him. He begins his non-digital real life. And She’s met her real life “Ronnie” and walks off into the French sunset. 

Dash in okay music, well-known faces, and corny jokes (especially about Alan being a boomer and girl being a clumsy introvert) and that’s a fucking Efron film. Probably a halfway successful Efron film. I’m shocked it isn’t already a movie."
dndhorrorstories,ff9ohbz,t1_fe9t3ve,1579717295.0,"Big or small town, I’m willing to bet there’s one. If there isn’t, there are TONS of online groups/websites who play over servers like Roll20. You wouldn’t play with people face to face but you may find a group you really like. Some of the online locations even have rigorous screening to help place you/keep out the weirder folks you might run into.

But back to your story: I don’t think the DM, and possibly the other players, like you that much, dude. But that’s going to depend on your age. I see a lot of DND horror stories involve high school age students taking a run at it for the first time. If you all are younger, you’re dealing with people who suck at picking up social cues. If you’re older, you’re dealing with a group who really should know that they are effectively leaving you out.

The party: I would be less than happy with them, here. They were one, ONE, session in. Session 1’s always put a group of completely unlikely partners into an adventuring party after “yada yada”-ing it. Like you have groups with each individual member having some ridiculous background (with some type of tragedy of course); completely different personal goals; entirely different, if any, motivations; and often with characteristics or statuses that do NOT go together (see groups where a lawful good paladin works with the chaotic neutral/evil rogue, and just lets all the murdering and stealing go). And YET, DnD PC’s will meet in a tavern, yada yada, and now were all adventurers forever bonded together for no reason! That happened with your group, literally one session ago. Maybe, in game, a few days ago. But suddenly now, right now, this group is just *too* tight knit to just allow some outsider with no connection or commonality with the group? Bullshit. That isn’t just being bad friends. It’s sticking to some arbitrarily hard line for sake of roll playing despite the fact that they all ignored this same line a session ago. Even still, maybe I could forgive them. Maybe they are in the zone with their characters having fun and they missed cues about you. Maybe they’re new and they thought that RPing that hard was what they were supposed to do, new guy be damned. Maybe they thought, correctly, that the DM should and thus would take care of it. But they just as easily could have thrown you a bone... one, *any* of the players could have said “oh I know that guy, she/he’s an old partner.” Or “oh, hey, c’mon why not let him/her join us, friends. The more the merrier.” If they blame role playing, then they’re role playing assholes.

Now to the DM: oh DM. This guy is either socially challenged or he does not like you. It would be bad enough if he just chose not to help you. That would be shitty. You know, maybe you ask an NPC “hey where that group of adventurers go?” Or “hey, where’s the bank?” And he just sticks to some arbitrary amount of info he decided that NPC possessed and says “you ask and they don’t know.” Yeah that sucks of him. But even worse than that, he isn’t just not helping you. He’s actively obstructing you joining the group. He isn’t saying these NPCs can’t help. He’s saying they won’t. Which means they know, and he knows they know, and he’s preventing them from telling you, because, idk, fuck you? Despite your intimidation or charisma rolls. Fuck, dude, he even gave you the *wrong money* and made you roll play going to a fucking bank and exchanging currency??? Like WHY??? WHY THE FUCK IS THAT PART OF IT? 20 bucks said that they didn’t have to do that in their first session. And even if he, for some bullshit reason, has a reason for you to have foreign currency, then fine. He can just say, “you asked around for a bit, then found your way to the bank district, where you exchanged your money for GP. You now have X GP. Asking around, you also now know where the major city districts are and know where the tavern is. Now what do you do?” Like that would have skipped all of that. Additionally, he could have helped with the group dynamic by setting you on the same quest alone to catch up, and/or making you a part of the quest by giving you some bullshit item. It isn’t like they were already in the dungeon crawl when you joined. They all RPed, and he allowed it, leaving you behind. Instead he made you roll play a lost tourist.

Essentially he dropped you in the middle of a city. And informed you that somewhere in this city is a person place or thing that will lead you to the group. Go. And then proceeded to give you no context or clues. And you can only see the city with your imagination. And he gets to narrate what your imagination is. And he’s willfully doing a bad job of narrating your imagination. A blind, lost tourist, in a city you don’t know looking for come thing or concept but you don’t what or where. This is like needle in a haystack but you don’t know what the needle is, and there’s a lot of shit in the haystack. And you don’t know how big the haystack is, anyway. It’s ridiculous. And it seems purposeful.

They could have, a thousand ways, found a way to fit you in there. And they didn’t. I would voice your opinion to the group. It looks like you already have to 2 people, the DM and another player, and it looks like they fired back with indifference. Let them know that that isn’t a good enough answer. That isn’t “how it goes.” No reputable DnD table would let that slide. I mean groups HAVE to allow “strangers” in all the time because of character death. It’s so stupid that they wouldn’t. The fact that they wouldn’t is a sign that either (a) they are just weird people who suck at realizing how hurtful or exclusive their actions are; or (b) they are well aware and don’t care because they don’t like you.

My guess? Is maybe they are all friends with you, more or less, but you’re “newer” to the majority of the group. And they are all a little longer as friends. And one person in the group doesn’t like you and is pushing the others to allow you to be treated that way. The others like you but are technically better friends with person who doesn’t like you. So they’d rather you just leave without a fuss because they ignored you instead of having a confrontation about it. Any chance one in the group doesn’t like that much? Or views you as an outsider. Or perhaps, any chance, you’re a little newer to this friend group than most everyone there?

Good luck, dude. I hope it was a one off. But it’s a pretty bad sign, the way things went. Maybe everyone just sucked that night but friends just typically don’t operate that way... I hope you find your group."

funny,ff2jao5,t1_ff2e8ks,1579508674.0,"Why would it undermine a God to worship? That, to me, seems kind of a non-sequitur on your part. Like: “yes, that gels with quantum physics. Yes, that is similar to observed and reputably theorized occurrences in nature. Yes, it’s well founded. So that kind of undermines God.” 

I’m not saying your argument is necessarily flawed, I just don’t see how you get there from that.

If a being perceives time in a manner that humans never could perceive time because of the sheer complexity: wouldn’t that be indicative of, at the very least, a being of higher existence and immense complexity. Not even getting to the moral value of such a being, just the feat of such comprehension would be God-like, in and of itself, I would think?"
funny,ff2iqv4,t1_ff20kl1,1579507940.0,"That’s thinking of time in too linear of a manner. Hypothetical: let’s say person X asks person Y to choose action A or action B. Person Y chooses action B as X watches. Does the fact that  X viewed Y’s choice negate the fact that Y freely exercised agency to choose option B? I would say not.

Take that same hypothetical and make to where X is watching a video of Y making this binary choice. X watches Y choose B. Still, agency exists in Y.

Now say X has already seen the video - already knows Y’s choice. X watches Y pick B action. X, despite already knowing the outcome, doesn’t alter the fact that Y chose what Y chose to do. Y still has agency. Arguably, X is even further removed from Y’s choice. A mere spectator rather than involved. The spectating isn’t even novel. It’s already known.

Now take God, who is (not in so many words - but for broad strokes purposes, according to the mythos, lore, scripture you may look to) a being existing in and capable of comprehending more dimensions than humans are able to perceive - if you assume the existence of some almighty creator that seemingly is not bound by the same limitations which bind you or I. This may include a perception and comprehension of time in a non-linear fashion. Time doesn’t occur as 1, then 2, then 3. Time perception occurs where 1-3 occurs simultaneously and is viewable or experienceable in any order or all at once.

So if such a being were to see (what humans perceive as) the future the same way you might view a video of something that already happened, or a memory, I think it’s a similar scenario. The way I know how a movie ends, because I’ve seen it, God may know how the future scenario plays out. I don’t control the actions of those in the movie and in the same way, God may not control the actions of a person with complete autonomy. The ending is known. The actions are out of external control.

Essentially, If God views the future like we can view things that happened in the past (because linear progression is irrelevant when you view time as a simultaneous jumble) then God knowing what happens does not remove agency from our actions.

At least that’s how I view the answer to that question. Because if there is a God, which I personally believe to be the case, the most sensible (laughable, sometimes, I know) state in which such a being exists would be a dimensional presence greater than humans are capable of understanding. Many physicists theorize that time doesn’t progress linearly nor does time progress at an absolute constant rate. Said another way, time happens in a jumble of points that human brains encode into a simpler, understandable “flow” that we understand as the linear progression of time. A consistent flow of time is theoretically one in a number of illusions our brains present to us to present a more logical world. Other illusions are how the brain just doesn’t show us small snippets of time to splice together the still images that our eyes take in. This splicing results in a smooth video that our brains can understand as vision rather than choppy, disorienting still frames.

So meshing the existence of God, and the theoretical nature of such a being, with understood or theoretical (but reputable) principals of the physical world results (for me) in a conclusion that such a being doesn’t operate under the same physical limitations that our own brains impose upon humans. Such a God perceiving time with an omniscience that allows the past, present, and future to be known and understood simultaneously may be an explanation that reconciles the apparent discrepancy.

Metaphysics and God isn’t exactly something covered in Catholic Sunday school but that’s how I’ve come to reconcile predestination and free will. I’m sure it’s an imperfect analogy and admittedly it’s one I’ve concluded independent of Dogma. However, Interestingly, a number of Catholic/Christian philosophers throughout history welcomed rather than cowered form the combination of attempting to understand God and understanding and recognizing the laws of the physical world/science. Some saw the existence of God to proven by the laws of physics in the purest manner. I always found that to be personally beautiful.

Hope this offers a perspective that may inform a different point of view than that which you posses. I also hope it offers a possible explanation for the discrepancy. Have a good one!"

movies,fejc7a6,t1_fejaa7o,1579166702.0,"Also, while you bring up aspects of the conversation that COULD be debated, that really wasn’t where the conversation was focused. While we discussed various topics in multiple comments across the single thread, it wasn’t like I needed to bring up things in your bullet points of items. The other commenter challenged the value of Disney IP. I pointed factual things concerning that IP. Marvel, Disney Princesses, Pixar, ESPN, 20th Century Fox, etc., are all HIGHLY financially valuable properties. I pointed out that most of these films are both commercial and critical successes. These aren’t things I’m passionate about. These are empirical statements which can be verified. In fact, their value and level of critical successes is marginally easier to quantify that streaming only content. That success can’t rely on financial figures, directly (like box office sales/DVD sales), to measure the success of any single IP.

That isn’t even to mention the complications behind many”Netflix original” content licenses. Many of these “originals” only signify that NF got the first or only entity with the right to stream that content in a particular country. They may not even OWN IP that has a “Netflix Original” logo slapped on it. They may not have created in their studios. Copyright holders can giveth, but can also taketh away. Or sell to higher bidders. Or just get hired to create for a higher bidder.

It’s cute by the way to bring up random points that weren’t discussed previously, point at them, and say well you didn’t talk about this so HA...

But please, tell me which part was I wrong about in my previous comments? The critical success? Show me the negative ratings consensus on high percentages of their films. Financial value? Show me low box office numbers on the majority of their films. Show me how Disney is valued lower on the stock exchange than Netflix. Show me how Netflix has larger brand awareness than Disney on a national OR global scale. I’ll wait."
movies,fejb7qw,t1_fejaa7o,1579165220.0,"I conceded that Netflix has better original content, actually, at least at the moment. I even conceded that Netflix was currently better, period.

Also I can’t help that you can’t see nuance in an argument because you’re predisposed to disagree with that position.

The entire premise of my argument is that Disney is unlikely to fail before Netflix, and that Disney+, specifically, is unlikely to fail.

The premise was NOT that Netflix is failing or necessarily will fail. Only that Disney+ will also succeed despite a competitor like Netflix occupying the field of play and that Disney has the ability to unseat Netflix.

Also, in terms of global appeal: Disney content widely, outside of Mulan and Winnie the Pooh, does really well in Europe and Asia, as well as the Americas... I don’t know where you’re getting info that they don’t perform well outside of the US. China is a huge supporter of their IP. So much so that’s it’s lampooned by South Park.

Further, and this a major point in my argument, Disney can likely afford to buy their way into the market. They can just throw money at the problem to match whatever their competitors are doing. While I enjoy Disney owned IP, as does many other Americans or humans across the globe, I don’t root for Disney like a fanboy. In fact, I made comments, upstream in the thread, mocking Disney as a dystopian overlord that’s just as likely to fuse with google and amazon and enslave everyone under some big brother corporate government.

To each of these points - these are things that Netflix had to manage. It took years for them to figure it out and create a model as successful as the one we currently see with them. Disney, again (and I’m by no means celebrating this fact), can just throw money at managing these problems. Along that fact, in previous comments to our conversation, I mentioned that Disney is doing fine by still catering to theater/cable centric content but will likely, along with all other content creators/the industry, will shift their focus. Currently, their model is more financially successful than Netflix. That is changing but hasn’t yet. Why would Disney shift their focus to only that market at the moment? Disney+ is in early stages. And in early stages where their focus isn’t on streaming.

The point of the post and the point of the original commenter was that Netflix poses a threat to fixtures in the industry, with a focus on Disney/Disney+. I countered that Disney will be fine. They’re currently valued at almost twice Netflix. Not quite but in the ballpark. They’re doing fine. And can afford to attract all the talent, content, and industry insight that money can buy.

clevercomebacks,fej2oez,t1_feixz0q,1579154651.0,"Well it is and it isn’t. It’s a foreign word that certainly didn’t originate in English but it’s a word that is found in the English dictionary. Just because we didn’t come up with a whole different word for it doesn’t negate its status as a word in the English language.

Bologna, like many words, across many languages, is a “loanword.” A loanword is a word that is adopted from language and incorporated into another language without translation. Said another way, It’s a word in our language, borrowed from another.

You could make the argument, of course, that baloney is becoming such a common spelling of the word in English (especially in America), though, that baloney is English and bologna is a foreign word that means baloney. In fact, my phone didn’t bother to autocorrect baloney. But Merriam-Webster’s dictionary, and the English language, still includes bologna.

Anyway, your point is undermined by the pronunciation of it all. The whole point the above poster was making was that the English language, especially American English, teaches pronunciations that are often ridiculous or counterintuitive. The correct, European/Italian pronunction of bologna, is practically phonetic: bowl-loan-nya. But in English, especially American, we pronounce it buh-loan-knee. And at the end of the day, person’s post was about how difficult it must be to try to pronounce English/American English words when the spelling leads to inconsistency in pronunciation. Bologna is a great example. And it makes for a funny joke. Don’t be so pedantic haha"
