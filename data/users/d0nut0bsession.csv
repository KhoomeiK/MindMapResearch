My GOODNESS Kansas has do many tornados.
While my grandma was pregnant with my dad and his twin, there was a massive tornado that wrecked everything in their house except for a single dresser that somehow survived, we actually fixed it up and it is in our house now!

I do remember one time, there were three tornados last year, all within a mile or two of eachother, and all heading towards us. The tornado sirens went off, and suddenly stopped, we all ran downstairs, and the tornados just narrowly missed us by a few miles.
On that same day, this huge(wide) apartment building nearby also caught on fire, so it was a pretty scary day
