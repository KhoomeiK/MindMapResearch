I have been turned down by many employers because I dont have a university degree in my field.  since I realized I had to show them by working harder, I have been able to create two businesses, find a solid career, and create change on a local level.

we are programmed through our ancestors genetics, brains, culture, etc, to behave and think in certain ways.
racism spawns from our tribal fear of ""others"".  when people are like us, we can predict them, understand them, accept them, and take comfort in familiarity.  when people are different, it is the opposite.  fear makes the lesser evolved individuals of the world react without logic or reason by feeling uncomfortable with the idea of unfamiliar others."

Advice,fgu4d37,t3_f0fkz9,1581113231.0,"I'm a former alcoholic as well who has found balance with drinking so it is possible.  my old addiction was to drink as much as possible, often not remembering parts of the night, waking up depressed and hung over, seeking to do it all over again.
my new behavior is being a professional, father, husband, business owner, and active person who likes to have a few beer and put my feet up a couple nights per week or when I'm out for dinner.  it has zero effect on my responsibilities and it is just one of lifes pleasures that I dont have to deny anymore because of my healthy relationship with it.  I dont know your partner but I would allow her the autonomy of being able to make this decision, under the understanding that she is testing the waters to see if she has the capability of keeping her habits healthy."

I know you feel trapped but you are only trapped if you are unwilling to do something you srent comfortable with.  a field of infinite potential possibilities lies in front of each moment."
