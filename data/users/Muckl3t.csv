Weddingsunder10k,ffikb2x,t3_etf84a,1579975911.0,My fiancé is just going to have a silicone ring. At first I thought the same as you. I wanted a “real” ring for the ceremony and special occasions. But eventually realized it was kind of silly to spend hundreds on something for him that he didn’t even want. It was a really easy place to save money for us.
Weddingsunder10k,ffiixq2,t1_ffi8r4e,1579974972.0,"If it’s really bothering you, you can make up the $100 in another part of your budget. Do a cheaper cake or fewer flowers. But honestly I think you got a really good deal very close to your budget and you look great so just enjoy it."

DuggarsSnark,ffh6kkc,t1_ffgezgo,1579924522.0,"Instead of downvoting, I’ll tell you. This is a sub to make fun of the Duggar family from the TLC show 19 kids and counting. Girl on the right is Jinger Duggar, the one on the left is a character from Handmaids Tale for humorous comparison."

You know literally nothing about him or his medical history. You’re just using autism to make your post look like a sob story."

wedding,ffehozp,t1_ffbh8u0,1579848432.0,"You “believe” her reasons are wrong but you don’t even know the actual reasons, you’re just guessing. It’s not your business. She obviously left him off intentionally. You can invite whoever you want to your own wedding."

FundieSnark,ffe9cxt,t1_ffcybsi,1579840296.0,Well she insinuated they didn’t have sex right away after marriage so it’s possible they waited long enough to be comfortable with it.
aftergifted,ffdwpyt,t3_eswlbd,1579830817.0,I really feel like I found my people in this sub.
FundieSnark,ffdwgl7,t1_ffd09y6,1579830631.0,"Girl Defined, they’re a couple of popular ones on here. Also look up the Rodrigues family and Paul & Morgan. Those 3 groups seem to make up the majority of the posts on here."
fatlogic,ffdduhm,t3_et03by,1579818798.0,This isn’t that bad of an idea unless the kid is already overweight. Natural consequences are a valuable tool. But you also need to let them stop eating when they say they’re full too. Way too many parents force their kids to finish their plates. Like there is no famine right now. Kid can eat tomorrow.
fatlogic,ffcy4cb,t1_ffbpwlo,1579809669.0,"Yeah I agree with this too. There’s literally no need to comment on someone’s weight unless they’re actively talking about how hard they’ve been working to achieve it. It’s just inappropriate and rude. Even when I am trying to lose weight in a healthy way, I consider it to be my private business so unsolicited compliments make me uncomfortable."
weddingplanning,ffcdocf,t3_esq5ou,1579797217.0,"I don’t want one. My fiancé does. So it’s Still up in the air. I just want it to be us and his kids (flower girl & ring bearer). We’re only having 50-60 people so I don’t want a good chunk of people standing at the front. It also seems like more trouble than its worth. I’ll have to pick out their clothes, wrangle everyone for the rehearsal, get bridesmaids hair & makeup done, figure out their transportation to the the ceremony with us, buy them gifts, get them bouquets and boutonnières, and I’m sure more things that I’m missing. Like why?? It’s extra expense and stress for everyone. I really hope I win this one lol"
weddingplanning,ffcbpt6,t3_estx91,1579795997.0,"First, I think your mom is being absolutely awful. But if you want them there anyway maybe find out what time the lacrosse games are? That can only be like an hour or so right? If they’re at 11 am you book the ceremony for 3 pm same day and they should be able to attend both no problem (I’m assuming you live in the same city though)."
hellofresh,ffb81zv,t1_ffb7mop,1579754537.0,Did you ask for that? I think $5 for a missing spice is fair but if you feel that made the whole meal garbage and told them that I’m sure they would’ve upped the refund for you.
hellofresh,ffb7g98,t1_ffb46i4,1579753905.0,What else are they supposed to do? Teleport the seasoning to you?
madlass,ffb6qqp,t1_ffaw02n,1579753289.0,It’s not stupid. It’s for the protection of the employees. Most stores are willing to take a financial loss for the safety of the employees. Getting into physical altercations with shoplifters is stupid.
Weddingsunder10k,ffappl5,t3_erylw2,1579741587.0,"I only like receiving food as favours so hoping to do a cookie in a bag but if that’s too expensive we’ll do a little box of candies. If people don’t take them home, more treats for me! If keychains get left behind what will you do with them?  I think a lot of key chains would end up in the garbage to be honest, especially if they have your names or wedding date on them."
DuggarsSnark,ff9grsd,t1_ff9crpy,1579712681.0,What the fuck? I had no idea this was a thing.  That’s awful.
BoomerTears,ff9fqxa,t1_ff7jop1,1579712055.0,"Why? If they care enough to get out and vote they should be allowed to do so. They’re old enough to drive, work, pay taxes, etc, they should get a say in those things as much as anyone else."
weddingdress,ff9ckwt,t3_esdgga,1579709945.0,Yes I just posted about this site on weddingsunder10k. Got a veil & dress for $197 including tax and shipping. I decided the one I ordered wasn’t for me but it was great quality. I’m going to keep looking and probably order another one from there. Definitely second this recommendation.
FundieSnark,ff8h8vv,t1_ff84r68,1579678398.0,Haha that’s literally one of the main tenets of Catholicism.

DuggarsSnark,ff5dn74,t1_ff4tm2c,1579588494.0,Why do you care so much about Jeremy? He is fat and I’m pretty sure he even made a couple jokes about it on Instagram.
Weddingsunder10k,ff4a005,t1_ff432gj,1579558786.0,I think so too. The dots are soft and fluffy.

FundieSnark,fepsq5n,t1_feplp7v,1579329982.0,I don’t think it’s making fun of her infertility. The ‘fatal’ implication is that she’s going to murder her sister.
DuggarsSnark,fepr4wt,t1_fel6j73,1579328477.0,Pros just wear slacks and collared tshirts like normal people. There’s nowhere in this century this outfit is fashionable.
weddingdrama,fepipe0,t1_feph6jx,1579321517.0,Yeah the whole thing is fake as fuck. The newspapers are harassing her for interviews? How would they have even found her. Cmon. I thought it was probably fake at first but all these pathetic follow ups make it more and more obvious.
Weddingsunder10k,fepan2o,t3_eq9avh,1579315901.0,I wrote off anyone who either required a phone call/meeting for a quote instead of emailing and I expected a response within a week.  It’s been an easy way to narrow down my options so far. They might be great but convenience is very important to me. I want this process to be as easy as possible.
AreTheStraightsOK,fen9bd5,t1_fem3lr2,1579279780.0,"Yeah I really don’t expect my fiancé to think I’m the most beautiful woman in the world. The idea is, frankly, ridiculous. I only care that he loves me the most regardless of my rank on the beauty metre. I think some people put way too much emphasis on beauty or maybe they are creating a different definition of it."
BringingUpBates,fen4pd4,t1_felo3ua,1579276910.0,"You want a useful medication banned because SOME people have negative side effects?? Better just shut down all the pharmacies completely then because ALL medicine has potential side effects. Yeah but sure, just ban birth control. Surely there’s no religious reasoning there..."

Weddingsunder10k,fegyqpe,t1_feeqw9x,1579105502.0,"I personally think you need to stop thinking about them in terms of props in pictures. These are your friends there to support you on your wedding day. A good photographer will do their job and make everything look nice and balanced. Humans come in all different heights, that’s not going to ruin the pictures. Let them be themselves and stop stressing about insignificant details. Like you say none of them have neon hair and you don’t think any of them plan to dye their hair, but you still want to implement a rule about no neon hair? I just think you’re focusing on things that do not matter whatsoever."

TopMindsOfReddit,fee5r8w,t1_fee0ni4,1579026965.0,That’s fine but it doesn’t mean OP is lying about the weather where he is.
TopMindsOfReddit,fedtgd5,t1_fedh5jy,1579019528.0,Canada is pretty big. It’s -34 where i live today. All of northern BC is fucking cold this week and we aren’t exactly in the Arctic.

weddingshaming,fdzt1lg,t3_ehyax2,1578795123.0,"My cousin did this too but with floating candles on the top that made the glass burning hot. So we went around and blew all the candles out. Later, at the end of the night, the couple abandoned the fish so we had to scoop them all up and take them home because the venue said they were going to flush them down the toilet. That was fun."
FundieSnark,fdngtjz,t3_em0uh5,1578585502.0,Gross! This is so exploitive. They are people. They are none of those adjectives. What a piece of shit. I’ve only seen this guy posted here a couple of times and he is quickly becoming my most hated fundie.
FundieSnark,fdnf5ab,t1_fdnam1s,1578584484.0,"If they’re anemic it’s likely caused by being underweight and malnourished, not the other way around. I’m sure their parents wouldn’t take them to a doctor to find out anyway."
FundieSnark,fdnensz,t1_fdnbjzm,1578584190.0,I really think it’s her smug facial expressions. If she would just smile sincerely like a nice normal human instead of sneering and fake smiling all the time she would look so much better. It’s hard to look at a face that’s constantly judging you.
fatlogic,fdkgahr,t3_eluhvm,1578503252.0,"It can sometimes work like that. If you’re a 5’1 couch potato and you eat the same amount of food as your 6’3 athletic husband then sure, you’re not fat  because you eat more than him, you’re fat because you eat too much for YOUR body. People don’t get that it doesn’t matter how much other people eat. Everyone has different caloric needs."

weddingdress,fdb667i,t3_ek98w1,1578254261.0,Haha what? There is no connection between those things. Wear a veil as a hair accessory if it looks nice. Who cares where she lives? Sounds like someone needs to be cut from the guest list.
illnessfakers,fd6b600,t1_fd5188h,1578188295.0,If you’ve gained 15 lbs that means you’re eating too many calories for your size. The weight gain is evidence of your diet regardless of how you feel about how little you’re eating.

Dogfree,fcvkwsd,t3_ej3g1o,1578004294.0,I usually give a half answer like “I’m personally more of a cat person” which is true but I stop just short of saying I don’t like dogs at all. Not worth the aggravation.

DuggarsSnark,fc9uf5u,t1_fc9qq5i,1577558374.0,I don’t think it’s snarking to say they might be using birth control. It would be a positive thing for them. A medical issue isn’t snark either. Nobody is criticizing those things.
