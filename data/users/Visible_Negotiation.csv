PersonalFinanceCanada,fec6e60,t3_eo9v4q,1578967405.0,The stress of never having enough money is greater than a few stressful years at the office.
PersonalFinanceCanada,fea5x0q,t3_eo4xc9,1578944729.0,"I hear you. We now share a wall with a frat house; and I work from home, so there's no escape. I wear headphones and listen to thunderstorms, etc., run fans at night and wear earplugs. 

I haven't tried acoustic panels for noise reduction. Some reviews swear they work to reduce noise from neighbors (and they're cheap; something like $20 for 12 wedges that measure 1""x12""x12"".  It might be worth a try. See  [https://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-Acoustic-Panels-Studio-Wedges/dp/B01JNAXIII](https://www.amazon.com/Charcoal-Acoustic-Panels-Studio-Wedges/dp/B01JNAXIII)"
