Thanks for reminding me to always read a little further!"
beauty,fgf05hd,t1_fgezqx0,1580717426.0,You would have to get it done in a salon if it’s a Redken color product. It won’t damage your hair and will help achieve the more seamless look your seeking. Their Shades EQ line is what’s generally used for toning/glazing and it produces beautiful results. Your hair will look/feel more healthy. How long the effect lasts depends on the porosity of your hair.

They make wigs with scalp effects, too, but you see the scalp more from the front, not on top of the head. I’ve been a stylist for 13 years and have seen many a hair piece. This looks to me like his natural hair with an unblended cut and, perhaps, a bad dye job (color is somewhat unnatural)."
90DayFiance,fgc9i8f,t1_fgbc6kx,1580670534.0,"It’s just a bad cut (and maybe color) that’s not blended properly, thus leaving a weight line. A toupee wouldn’t be that thin on top/show scalp."

“The wig wearing all started after McKayla elected to get a pixie haircut back in late July. “I’m getting a pixie,” McKayla revealed in a video documenting the before an after uploaded on July 27. “The reason I’m doing this is because my hair is so damaged,” she explained. “I haven’t gone blonde, I haven’t gone lighter with my hair or anything, it’s just super, super damaged. And there’s some other factors playing in that is making my hair even drier, so what’s going to be happening is I’m going to just cut it all off and start fresh.”

Prior to getting her hair cut, McKayla said that she might elect to keep the short ‘do if she likes it. “If I don’t like it that much, then I’ll grow it out. It’s not a big deal. It’s hair.”
