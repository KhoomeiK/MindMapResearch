PlayStationNow,fej5l39,t3_ep8yx1,1579157799.0,Was this last night? Mine started playing up for the first time last night? Iâ€™m wondering if it just messed up last night. I was streaming tv as well but I have been every other time Iâ€™ve played it. Also Iâ€™m in the uk and weâ€™ve had a storm the last couple of days so couldâ€™ve been that.
