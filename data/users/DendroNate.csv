AskReddit,fex37p3,t3_eqjo4d,1579423558.0,"Went on a date with a pretty cute girl I'd met online. Just to set a backdrop, we originally planned to meet for drinks like a week before this date, but I came down with a super nasty flu and ended up having to bail. I explained that I really wanted to meet her, but didn't want to get her sick, too, cause this flu really sucked. She was cool with it and we decided to rain check it.

Once I was better, we arranged to finally meet a couple of weeks later. I wake up on the morning of the date and, lo and behold, I'm coughing my lungs out again. One of those really ridiculous tickling coughs which just won't stop. I dosed myself up with cough syrup all day, not wanting to cancel again and miss my chance with this girl, and it seemed to do the trick. By that evening, I was feeling fine. 

I get to the bar before her, get us some drinks and sit at a table. She walks in and she's clearly made an effort. I go to tell her how good she looks, when the tickle rears its ugly head again. I literally started coughing and spluttering on ""Hey!"" And didn't even get past ""you look fantastic."" I spent literally the entire night coughing. Barely got a word out, and every time she tried to speak, I'd cough over whatever she said. I even spat my drink out on more than one occasion.

We never spoke again."

I spend a lot of time around horses and it's amazing how the same horse can be a monster, kicking and biting, with some people, then a big soft puppy the minute their owner approaches. They're intelligent, sensitive animals. Hard work to forge a bond with, but once you do, it's totally worth it."

AskReddit,fd8vlif,t3_ek6lpw,1578224044.0,"One of my best friends growing up was my cousin. He was a couple of years younger than me, and we lived right across the street from each other, so we'd hang out a lot growing up. As we hit our teenage years, we drifted apart, mainly due to me starting secondary school a couple of years before he did.

Throughout my teenage years, I was pretty homophobic. I think this was partly my own sense of what it meant to be a ""man"" and the confirmation bias provided by being surrounded by other Teenage boys with the same prejudices. 

When I was about 16, me and my cousin met back up at a family gathering, and I couldn't help but notice something. He was gay. Like, the whole nine yards, loud, camp gay guy. But I also realised this was nothing new. Even as little kids, he'd always been like this. It hit a few notes with me.

Firstly, this wasn't a ""lifestyle"" he'd chosen... It was part of him. It was integral to him being who he was. Secondly, it had never once mattered. We'd been friends for years, and I'd never realised. So why would it matter now?"
