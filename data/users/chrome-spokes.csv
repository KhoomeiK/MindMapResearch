Good on you for inquiring. And may you take with you, and pass on to others the knowledge gained to help do away with some of the stigma and misunderstanding associated with alcoholism.

 And before the meeting starts, during the break if there is one, and after the meeting, I and others make it a point to talk with them about AA in general, about the  meetings, etc. Every student I have spoken with has walked away with a positive experience. 

Open Meetings are just that... open for any and all to attend. While ""Closed Meetings"" are for only admitted alcoholics to attend, as some of us feel more comfortable in ""opening up"" with only other alcoholics around. 

To find opening meetings near you, you can call the local AA Office and they will be glad to assist. Or, go on line to the find the same. 

Besides those two types of meeting, there are many others depending usually on the size of the community you live in/near. A few examples are speaker meetings, AA book study meetings, men only and women only meetings, even meetings for the deaf in larger cities! 

They usually last either one hour or one-1/2 hours. All meeting are free to attend, this though  the basket is passed around to chip in to help pay the rent, (often at a church), and for the coffee, etc. Oh yeah, the coffee, we make great coffee, hah!

And the truth will set us free, free to move forward.

And forward it has gone. Where I can hold my head up in any situation, can own up and rectify the errors I make in everyday living life with dignity. This, thanks to AA. Can't beat that.

To address this first... so is it also a defect when we do things for others because it makes us feel good about ourselves? Is it a defect feeling good about our sobriety? The positive list goes on and on. So no, of course not a defect. Sponsors aren't know-it-all's, aren't god or whatever, just another human with their own experiences. 

That said, as alcoholics, we are damn experts at making ourselves feel good, hah! So, it is when carried to on to ill-effect, both for ourselves and others, is when the sh*it hits the fan. 

Importantly, too, is motive.

Ok then. My own story... when newly sober, I wanted to yell it from the roof tops, to let everyone know how it felt so damn good from the living hell in the throes of my drinking that I'd crawled out of. ...

Well then, the motive, (in part), was in self-seeking from others of validation, affirmation, words to that effect. Being center of attention, if you will. Which in doing so took away some, (not all), of the humbleness and humility that was gained in getting sober.  Ha well, that was tempered by a couple friends saying, yeah, it's about damn time you got sober! 

But in time, yes I let my family and close friends know. After all, it is a part of us now, being sober. As far as with others, too, it is important to break our sobriety when we feel it can help someone else who's exhibiting drinking problems, even if hear from their family or friends expressing concern. So there it is... Motive again, in being useful.

PS edit: You may want to share this whole posting to your sponsor, and/or talk it out more with her?  

Also, when doing my 9th-step with others, I let them know I was now sober. Making amends, yep, yet in atonement by letting them know the changes, what I am doing now so as to not repeat such harms, and being sober is one mighty big item in that aspect."

Or as I like to put it, ""We baffle situations that intuitively used to handle us"". ;O)

Okay then... If we're in fit spiritual condition, we can be around where alcohol is served. 

I simply, [keep it simple!], say ""No thanks, I do not drink."" Others with whom I feel closer with and can handle it, when offered a drink or asked why I'm not drinking, I come off with the ol' standby, ""No way, I'm allergic to alcohol! Yep, I break out in hand-cuffs!""  Or really closer to the truth for myself, ""I break out in a straight-jacket!"" 

{Edit added... Times been I have blown my own anonymity, sorta, with saying, ""Nope, I'm one of those who one drink is too much and a thousand is not enough.""  They usually get the idea and let it go.}

That all said, I can handle being around others 'social' drinking. Most of the time. It is when folks get shit-faced drunk that I feel uncomfortable, as reminds like looking in a mirror how I used to drink. I just don't want to be around it. And so I just say my goodbyes, see ya later, and leave. And I'm not alone it this, drunks can be a downer at a gathering. 

Whatever, wherever, whenever... I put my sobriety first. I own it, earned it, cherish it, care for it and protect it.

No worry, it'll sort it self out. Took courage to even write here in being honest about what all is going on with you. A big step in itself.

A little AA saying about ""taking baby steps""... this is what I did when first in AA with talking only one-on-one with a guy there, (who later became my AA sponsor.) ...

Felt comfortable that way. And in the meetings, I sat there and listened up, didn't open my mouth for a while. 

And when finally did share at the meeting level, yeah, I was uncomfortable at first. ""Risked taking the risk"", indeed. And for the better is all. So, now they can't shut me up, hahaha! (No, not that drastic, but you get the drift?) 

And ya know what? What we say/share about, it may help someone else. Even sharing about being uncomfortable to do so, someone else may at that moment being going through the same. 

So no matter, we each have our quirks. With the AA Triangle being ""Unity, Recovery, Service"", within those there is lots of room in to find a nitch that suits one's self. 

> I couldn't imagine not being able to have a drink ever 

Bingo! We've all been there, at least so, so many of us. That's why sayings as ""one day at a time"", ""only for today"", came about. Just for today, I do not have to drink. And let tomorrow be.

And I found exactly that help in AA, starting first with going to meetings and talking with other AA'ers. There in AA, I found the solutions to my out of control drinking, was given the gift of sobriety, and been sober now for over 25-yrs, if matters.

As ""our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety"". For AA is not a fix all. ...

Indeed, I went to mental health therapy after 6-yrs being sober, as AA is not equipped to handle such. And damn glad I did. Would suggest the same for you, both AA and therapy? They can work hand-in-hand in living life to better effect.

No one 'has' to do anything, either in AA or out, whatever works for the individual to stay sober is what matters. (Expecting hard core by-the-book book-thumpers down-voting now, hah)

That said, in the big book (or the 12x12?), has no hard set guidelines. As mentions doing the 5th step with a clergy member, trusted friend, even spouses if recall correctly?

Here's an example of what is open to do... A good AA friend of mine was at an AA convention. He started talking with another AA'er he had never met before. The connection of the two felt right-on, so my friend asked this complete stranger if he could do his 5th-step with him, then and there. The other guy agreed, they did it, and never saw each other again. Friend has 27+ years sober, if counts for anything.

So there it is. With another human being, one you can open up with honestly and fully as possible, with also important is one you can trust to keep what is said to themselves.

If may add a little bit more?... 

That psychiatrist I went to? Well, she was one smart cookie, for even though she'd only asked those two questions about how much and how often, she saw right through my trying to B.S. her about my drinking. And outright told me to go to AA or that she could not help be of much with me. 

So, after I left her office, (and went home and promptly got drunk that night as usual, hah), and two days later I went to my first AA meeting. ...

Driving on the way over there I was wondering, (sorta like you're asking here, simpleskeleton), if these AA people could help me to enjoy and control my drinking again? Well, they weren't having any of that, because they didn't know how to do it either, haha! 

So there it is. Sobriety is the name of the game. Indeed, in AA ""our main purpose is to stay sober, and to help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.""  Simple as that.

""...enjoy and control my drinking again?"" Yeah well, the drinking to party and have a good time, those days were gone. For when I was able to control my drinking I was miserable because I always wanted more. And when I drank the way I wanted to, I was of control and made everyone around me miserable! No win situation there, boy-o!

So here's the deal with AA. It offers solutions to live with contented sobriety. Where both that insane need to drink and even the want to drink are put to rest. ...

Best deal in town. Where it costs nothing, don't even have to unless you want to, to throw a dollar or two in the basket that helps pay the rent for where a meeting is at. And also helps pay for the snacks and coffee we usually have there. Oh the coffee, we make the best coffee hah!

Denial. We can slip in and out of it so often so fast.

 So my questions for you are: are you in denial of how serious, how detrimental your drinking has progressed? In enough denial to look for a way to try to control it, when from what you've written, you have already proven that you cannot?

Now comes fear. Myself, I finally realized fear played such a big part in my drinking, meaning the fear of not drinking scared the living shit outta me.

I don't recall much, except for laughing at her, calling her Nurse Ratchet, (of Cuckoo's Nest fame).

Fast forward about 10-yrs as the alcoholism progressed to where I'm suicidal, just could not stop on my own, much less control my drinking in any way. The ""gift of desperation"" set in and I went to see a full-blown psychiatrist. At the end of that 1st one hour session with her, she directed me to go to AA, or she couldn't be much help to me! This though I lied about my drinking to her, how much, how often, (which was daily). Hah, that pissed me off, how dare she think I need AA?!? [edit added: This is prime example of how powerful the denial of one's alcoholism works, in and out of it at any given moment at times]
