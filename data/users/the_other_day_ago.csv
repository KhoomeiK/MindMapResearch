raisedbynarcissists,ff6kv2e,t3_erv7f5,1579629363.0,"Isnt it so huge when this happens. When you realize that you dont have to carry around these hurts and create resentments. Everytime me and my SO would argue I always felt so defeated because he would explain why he was upset and because I couldnt I felt like I was always in the wrong. So when I finally was able to communicate my side of things it made a big impact on me and our relationship. I felt valid and heard, it taught me how to do it in out in the world too. Keep it up! Sometimes it may take a while to sort your thoughts out but take your time. Sometimes I like to write quick notes or list what I am thinking to help keep me on track."

insaneparents,feo4vmu,t1_feo3yaa,1579295117.0,"I guess FBI since it is a federal crime to kidnap a child plus we went out of state. We did go to PA but they found us in Texas. And I think she avoided jail time because she said he was a monster so she had to take us, but really IDK"
insaneparents,feo1ee5,t1_feo08gy,1579293789.0,"! explanation My parents were divorced, my mom was living in a condemned motel and could not take care of us. We were living in California at the time but from Pennsylvania. She said she wanted to take us to visit family but instead went on the run. FBI found us about a year after. She is not a very good criminal
We were put in foster care for year and half after returning to CA because my mother then accused my father of completly untrue horrendous things. So the state didn't know who to give us back to

Edit:
I never thought putting myself out there like this would return as much love and support and understanding as what I have gotten back.
