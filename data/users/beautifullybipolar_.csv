bipolar,ff3mc12,t1_ff2an63,1579544110.0,You have no idea how much that means to me. It was exactly the inspiration I needed to get through today. Thank you.
bipolar,fek889s,t1_fejmq8g,1579194654.0,Journal it down. Just write it. It’ll help you explain to your therapist and maybe get to the bottom of why your brain feels ok in time of question but not in reality.
bipolar,feiub3p,t1_feilrdl,1579147410.0,"If you’re in therapy it can also be a really healthy/good way to look at your week with your therapist since when you go in the office people can kinda be like “uhhhhhh, yeah my life sucks but I can’t remember why” type of thing. Super helpful! And makes you think about why you’re feeling this way."
bipolar,feh9fz9,t1_fegcxba,1579111906.0,I’m starting to figure that out. I am starving all the time. I feel like my stomach is a bottomless pitt
relationship_advice,feftkkl,t3_eop40o,1579064784.0,"So I have a VERY similar situation. My boyfriends parents are assholes & so belittling. They always comment about how he’s underweight, too skinny, anorexic, etc. I think you should stand up for him & you. They’re not just attacking him, they’re attacking you. If they don’t gain respect for you for standing your ground, then the next step would be to cut them out until they respect you guys and your relationship."
bipolar1,fefj1kv,t3_eei9zk,1579057355.0,"Look into what your state/county offers. Each county should or major county near you should have a mental health facility that will prescribe you medicine with very little to no cost. I’m talking like $12. It’s not a forever solution because usually those clinics are first come first serve. So say, the clinic opens at 7 am, be in line at 630am. This can really ease a situation. Usually you need to prove you live there to receive services, but that be proved with a bill, lease, etc. look into it. Your mental health is worth it."
