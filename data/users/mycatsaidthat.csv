cats,ffplzqk,t3_euia8z,1580098361.0,"Yep cats can have allergies and they can also take allergy medicine for it too just like us. Ask your vet on your next visit what they recommend.  If they suggest Benedryl liquid just be aware that when cats take it, they absolutely hate it and will froth at the mouth bc it’s the nastiest tasting thing for them; pills too unless you’re sure you can pill your kitty yourself. I’ve always asked for it to be compounded into a transdermal gel that I rub on the ear flap. Works great:-)"
