technology,ffditsl,t1_ffc8s7p,1579821778.0,"The federal gov't created the mandate for public utilities, which allows states to create entities to enforce the public utility rules.  If the last mile is subsidized it would be determined by the public utility trust.

So it'd be up to individual states to determine who gets the hook ups easily and who doesn't.  Either way they'd start getting money back from people who used to the service, it does not intend to be a free service. It's not charity it's making it easier for other Americans to get ahead as well.

Consider it an investment in improving people's earning potential, which then increases the overall amount of money the government can bring in.  Just like the first time they subsidizes ISPs building networks across the country and all the time's they've subsidized it since.

Here's a list of federal programs helping make sure other rural Americans get to enjoy a high standard of living and aren't left behind.

It's really much less complicated than you seem to think it is. The federal government already subsidizes ISPs, this would just treat them like utilities.

>The Proto-Indoeuropean root *reg- meaning move in a straight line originated the Old English word riht, meaning just, good, fair; proper, fitting; straight, not bent, direct, erect, which eventually became the English word right.

>Before the 12th century, the Old English words for left and right were winestra (derived from the Latin word sinestra, or left) and swiþra, which meant stronger. In the 13th century the two words were replaced by the words left and right, borrowed from the Kentish Dialect. The Kentish word left derived from the Old English lyft- (weak, useless), while the Kentish word right was also derived from the Old English word riht, probably meaning that the right hand was the “proper” hand to use.
