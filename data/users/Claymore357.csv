socialanxiety,ff4kjb7,t3_erhuxb,1579565837.0,(Not so) Fun fact if your anxiety is bad enough to trigger an adrenaline rush your stomach stops digesting things. That’s one of many not fun adrenaline side effects. It’s totally fine when you’re in actual danger (or just playing airsoft or racing motorcycles to give personal examples) however when you’re just trying to give a speech talk to someone or simply continue existing it does less than nothing to help

airsoft,ff1rgat,t3_er2zz4,1579484543.0,For indoor I’ve got Oakley Assault 2 they were on sale and are very comfortable like a bastard child between a cross trainer and a combat boot. The soles are also fairly soft so you can move around really quietly. According to my ex army friend they tend to fall apart outdoors tho. In his words it probably because they are too comfortable but in an urban environment they are great. Still looking for a good outdoor boot. The us marines standard issue surplus boots are it tho they work but comfortable isn’t a description I’d use

airsoft,fep46ja,t1_fep3kvk,1579311744.0,That’s exactly it. On league night we were trained to be selective with our shots. I always am as I usually run gas guns so I’ve only got 30 shots per mag vs 80-150 that an aeg gets. I only get in a spraying mood when hits aren’t called but tracers usually get people to call just fine. Hard to deny a hit with a still glowing bb stuck in your vest
airsoft,fep2i8h,t1_fep1u7x,1579310674.0,I was there too. That ended up being really fun. The main reason I like the high fps limits is you can usually feel them through the vest and people are more likely to call hits. It also give you some flexibility to upgrade your guns. Sometimes in the old days we had league nights where it was all experienced players and we would take the joule limit as a suggestion with everyone’s ok. Sometimes as high as 2.2J. Either way you guys have a nice field down there
airsoft,feor988,t1_feo8ou0,1579304357.0,In Edmonton we allow 400 info with no MED. 1.59J or under and you’re good. Can’t remember the outdoor limits off hand but they’re surprisingly low.

vancouver,fekfi4b,t1_fek5uod,1579198959.0,How exactly would you get Alberta into renewables? I’d love a viable answer here. We could just start mining lithium... oh wait we don’t have any here. Hmm okay cobalt then hang on none of that either. How about cadmium? Nope dry of that too. See where I’m going with this? The best we can do is try to mine our oil as cleanly as possible to reduce our impact as much as we can which we have already been doing for over a decade. Far as I can tell we have no simple solution to transfer over biggest industry to anything else without unbelievable unemployment and a detroit style mass exodus. We are a resource based economy and unlucky for us we don’t get to pick what resources we get to mine off a menu. If that were the case I’d have a diamond mine in my backyard.
vancouver,fekei6j,t1_fek8fru,1579198368.0,"Especially if you don’t have any natural resources to assist in your transition. We have oil. We can’t just wave a wand and say something in latin and transform it into lithium. We also can’t just shut down an entire industry and put 100,000+ people out of work since shelter food and heat aren’t free"
SandersForPresident,fekckjf,t1_fejs0sw,1579197217.0,"My problem with magnets is over time they cause damage. I was working for a company contracted to upgrade the city’s internet to fibre optic. We had the telecom company’s logo on all our trucks with magnet “stickers” because they could be removed if we saw another customer. A month later the company ordered all magnets to be removed from the fleet immediately as they were starting to damage the paint. Vinyl decals are much better imao. Actually designed to use on car paint and windows. Easy to install durable and removable with no mess.

airsoft,fei4jol,t1_fei3c7x,1579130124.0,Fair enough. It’s just surprising to hear how easy it is to get a gun based on those comments. While it’s a tad too strict up here I’d argue that a 2 day safety course isn’t out of line for something that can kill someone intentionally or not. We have the same thing for motorcycles here too although that one isn’t mandatory but is highly recommended by every rider I know.
socialanxiety,fei48bp,t3_ep8qdz,1579129928.0,"Everyone is different so this may not help very much but I had a similar problem when I was in jr high (middleschool, grade 7 I think to be exact I’m 23 now so it’s a but fuzzy). A few of my friends and some others in my class were hanging out after class waiting to be picked up. Among us was a girl had a fairly big crush on. Her ride just arrived so she started saying her goodbyes. When she turns to me she gave me a hug and a pretty tight one at that. While that innocent bit of affection felt really good it came with a surprise side effect. I turned cherry red mid embrace. Like such a hard blush I could feel my face getting hot and automatically knew what colour I turned without looking. Fortunately her head was next to mine rendering her unable to see what’s going on with me and by the time we let go it subsided. Lucky break. The funny thing is the more attention I got from girls and the more affection I received seemed to reduce the blushing to the point now where it doesn’t happen anymore from that. Not even a make out session will do it (becoming embarrassed from something will still cause it mind you). So perhaps what you need is more exposure to warm pleasant interaction with women. It may happen more at first but should die down. Anyway that’s my thoughts on the situation hope it helps!"
airsoft,fei1phy,t1_fei1e74,1579128359.0,Interesting. I’m starting to understand why Canada has 0 ar15 shootings (firearm accidents are omitted from this for obvious reasons) while the usa has too many every month it seems. Our gun crime is very low however our firearm related gang crime is rampant and theft with illegally obtained firearms is rising and our government is trying to use that combined with us gun violence as a justification for mass disarmament.
airsoft,fehn3id,t1_fehmuba,1579119892.0,Huh we have a 2-3 day course a few written tests then a background check that takes 3 months or more to complete and if you want an RPAL (restricted category version which allows things like ar15s semi auto vectors and handguns) it’s more like 6 months
airsoft,fehkes3,t1_feh2aio,1579118342.0,Don’t you have to take a several day training and safety course before being allowed to purchase real guns? That would negate the point of a waiver. In my country we call it a PAL (Possession Authorization License)
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,feh78jf,t1_feh6htt,1579110602.0,I’d give you gold if I wasn’t poor. An upvote will have to do
facepalm,fegzqx5,t3_ep0tk4,1579106120.0,Well my country’s “solution” is to tax everyone on essential things. We will literally die without heat which we can only use furnaces for (some people have wood stoves but some areas literally outlawed that). As I type this it’s-40 ℃ outside my door. They also taxed electricity so you charge your electric car? Guess what carbon tax bitch. We have no viable alternatives that will work in such extreme conditions. We have wind and solar farms but they are failing to even produce 1 mw of power when their potential is 15 mw for the solar farm. We shut down our coal power plants (the 5 cleanest burning ones on eating btw) to buy coal power from the USA because we cannot produce enough for ourselves. Basically we have been told you figure out a solution but in the meantime here’s a tax to make every aspect of life more expensive while you try to solve it. With such poor solutions it’s easy to look at this as just a money grab for the politicians to waste
airsoft,fegybew,t1_fegt6r6,1579105237.0,Might also have something to do with the fact that field limits are in energy (joules) not fps and light bbs are high fps and low energy but idk
airsoft,fegy86x,t1_fegt6r6,1579105182.0,Yes if they are found in your bag you have to toss them put them in your car or leave. 0.2s are fine for grenades. I don’t know for sure but I believe it’s because they break so easily and are generally low quality. I’m just speculating tho. I run 0.2s in my 40mm grenades and they are great so no complaints here
AnimalsBeingDerps,feg1wc8,t3_eordtx,1579073349.0,Surprised my little dog hasn’t pulled this one yet. It’s been -30 to -40 ℃ all week and she is having none of it
airsoft,fec6vrt,t1_febusrh,1578967668.0,Yeah not at all good. Those bbs are meant for walmart springers that don’t even make 200 fps. Automatic ban if you’re caught with them for good reason. If you got high performance guns use high performance bbs.

In Canada there is no orange tip rule for anyone over 260 fps (I’m pretty sure that’s the number anyway) however if you try to stick up a store with it you get the same charges weather you use an airsoft gun or a real steel firearm which deters people from doing it. May as well use the real thing if the consequences are the same that way you aren’t holding an empty threat. If you’re caught open carrying an airsoft gun you get a $10,000 fine and when the local community finds out don’t be surprised when you’re banned from every field and event in town. On the field the realistic look seems to hop up the adrenaline rush in a way that a paintball gun or an orange nerf gun looking thing just can’t.

socialanxiety,fdktr05,t3_eliyza,1578510977.0,Lately I’ve been building a motorcycle to ride when spring hits. Usually though I play airsoft. Funny because it’s a highly social game that requires clear concise communication between your team to do well. The thing I love about it (aside from the adrenaline and making the perfect shot and/or doing something epic to turn the tide of the game in your favour) is that it’s the only place my anxiety can’t control me. People I play with tend to look to me for leadership of the team by default from when I started playing regularly and I don’t know why. However I’ve got a tactical mindset and just take charge often helping us to victory. Among that group I’ll speak up in a crowd during the briefing or talk to the people in the safe area even if I don’t know them. Things that would be unthinkable anywhere else.
