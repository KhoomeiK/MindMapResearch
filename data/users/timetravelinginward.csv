Accounting,feaivyw,t1_fe8jqo0,1578949408.0,Like ‚Äúmiss‚Äù.
Accounting,fe6cyrc,t1_fe66tnb,1578887303.0,Never heard it pronounced that way.
SALEM,fe6cpbo,t1_fe695p6,1578887104.0,That seems like a waste of a 911 call for a non-violent crime.
AskReddit,fdyc3rp,t1_fdybvkn,1578778191.0,Wouldn‚Äôt you say it‚Äôs been a long time? I‚Äôve spent 20-30 years hearing it the technically incorrect way.
TwoXChromosomes,fdwqryo,t1_fduuw3q,1578761406.0,Seems like they have more than you. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
AskReddit,fdtyl2r,t1_fdruxyi,1578724376.0,"I‚Äôll probably just keep on using what sounds right even if it‚Äôs wrong. People will only question it and it‚Äôll cause more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. Plus, language follows how people use it."
NintendoSwitch,fdoa05d,t1_fdo6rmc,1578601452.0,That‚Äôs my point. You have to buy both. You can‚Äôt wait for the polished one and skip the beta.
NintendoSwitch,fdo9q5u,t1_fdo6noq,1578601321.0,They don‚Äôt want you to complete the dex anymore.
NintendoSwitch,fdnzr9d,t1_fdnxgun,1578596159.0,"No, it doesn‚Äôt completely rule it out, but they did pretty directly say it was replacing that model."
NintendoSwitch,fdniwfs,t3_em587a,1578586753.0,I‚Äôll give it a shot. :)
NintendoSwitch,fdnijix,t1_fdnifsg,1578586537.0,"Is this confirmed or just speculation? I also believe it will because they‚Äôll milk everything, but haven‚Äôt seen a price source yet."
NintendoSwitch,fdni13m,t1_fdnd4z7,1578586230.0,"I used to use /r/pokemontrades a lot back in the day. Lots of nice people there willing to help with trade evolves and such in their free time. Much better than GTS. Not as ideal, but it‚Äôs how I got my first and second living dexes."
NintendoSwitch,fdnhpcz,t1_fdnhmab,1578586038.0,"No clue yet. Likely, but if it‚Äôs like Bank, it was $5 a year. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll be included with NSO, but I really doubt it."
NintendoSwitch,fdnhb6c,t1_fdnbq4e,1578585800.0,Is Pok√©mon Home going to be free (outside of an NSO subscription)? Or have they confirmed a subscription price for it like Bank had?
NintendoSwitch,fdngrxf,t1_fdneowd,1578585475.0,The only part I don‚Äôt see as a win is I can‚Äôt just wait for the non-beta version since the DLC is replacing the ‚Äúultra‚Äù version. Reserving my judgement for now though to see if it really adds enough content for the price tag.
NintendoSwitch,fdnglcd,t1_fdne8hl,1578585364.0,Is that confirmed yet? I‚Äôve been out of the loop?
NintendoSwitch,fdngf9p,t1_fdng6x5,1578585262.0,[It brings in from pretty much every game. It can only be dumped into Sword and Shield at the moment though.

NintendoSwitch,fdng8bd,t1_fdnbdck,1578585146.0,"They‚Äôre saying this is replacing that model. They plan on doing DLC in the future. Basically, this is the definitive model. You can‚Äôt wait for the third version anymore. You have to buy the first, incomplete game, and then the DLC on top of it."
NintendoSwitch,fdng11n,t1_fdneoyc,1578585023.0,Or from Home if you have them from old games.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdigeag,t1_fdhuiw0,1578442312.0,We‚Äôve only used it with the initial $7 off coupon from being referred by a friend and then $20 off for having a friend use your code
insaneparents,fdazpxq,t1_fd9vqo8,1578252129.0,"It was actually important that Jesus be born of man, which makes it weirder. It‚Äôs his righteousness that is what matters since he takes the sin of others and gives them his righteousness. The Catholic Church went and made weird fanfic of Mary being really important when she‚Äôs just an average person. It was a fully divine being lowering itself to be born into humanity. 

I mean, all of what I just typed sounds just as ludicrous, but it‚Äôs part of the original story. Then there‚Äôs the apocrypha and gnostic gospels for more fanfic."

madlads,fda0iqg,t1_fd95m9z,1578240324.0,Some Americans. I think it‚Äôs pretty gross.
bigdickproblems,fd9wsm4,t1_fd53daq,1578238971.0,At least 2 inches.
AskReddit,fd5cei0,t1_fd2p3xw,1578176224.0,They have train cars just for women too.
SALEM,fczxm3l,t1_fcz4uxn,1578110367.0,You aren‚Äôt wrong about the cult-like following. They have a group for that location specifically on Facebook. It has almost 2k members.
ChoosingBeggars,fcyme2s,t1_fcy8fs2,1578082700.0,But we‚Äôre hearing about the non-crazy ones in this specific thread. Maybe that‚Äôs the real confirmation bias. ü§î /s
OldSchoolCool,fcvfqcv,t1_fcvf4nh,1578001146.0,You need to watch Louis CK for the updated version.
OldSchoolCool,fcvflax,t1_fcuyrqb,1578001061.0,Late night on cable gets away with it. I think any cable could get away with it. They just don‚Äôt want to lose advertisers.
dbz,fcsoh4d,t1_fcrz17u,1577921099.0,"I don‚Äôt know. Middle row, second from the right kind of does."
todayilearned,fcrzl1l,t1_fcrtg5m,1577909001.0,A lot of my friends were into it during high school. We‚Äôre in our mid 30s.
todayilearned,fcrzcuc,t1_fcrx8a1,1577908868.0,"It‚Äôs more fan fiction that got published. The only time it‚Äôs came back at all is in Heroes or video games, which also are not canon. A lot of people like to make it their head-canon that it‚Äôs an alternate timeline, but that‚Äôs never officially been stated. 

That‚Äôs not to say it can‚Äôt be. The movies aren‚Äôt canon, but Toriyama did make a canon version of Broly."
todayilearned,fcrw4mg,t1_fcrq2wa,1577907432.0,"Yeah, but I only got technical because you got technical to the parent comment. :)"
todayilearned,fcrprgg,t1_fcre4lj,1577904980.0,Yeah. Just look at Pok√©mon.
todayilearned,fcrpnar,t1_fcrjvvy,1577904937.0,"Most people hate GT because it‚Äôs not canon and didn‚Äôt like the direction it went. Interestingly, they still tend to love SS4 despite that."
todayilearned,fcrpacj,t1_fcrhzm7,1577904796.0,Not in the manga. Goes from Dragonball to Dragonball Super.
todayilearned,fcrp2gq,t1_fcrjnpq,1577904712.0,"Technically Dragonball is the name of the entire original run (Emperor Pilaf-Buu Saga) in the manga. The second half is only called Z for the anime. So going by manga, there‚Äôs Dragonball and Dragonball Super."
funny,fcnupjy,t1_fcntedc,1577818793.0,"I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd use ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù, and ‚Äúdumb‚Äù to describe differences, but it‚Äôs just weird to me since I‚Äôve seen it one way all my life."
funny,fcnujms,t1_fcnu0cs,1577818699.0,Yeah. I‚Äôm all for the metric system. It‚Äôd be so nice to be able to just multiply by 10s.
television,fcnpowm,t1_fcmh4sf,1577816089.0,"Do you have a source for that last claim? The best I could find was a stat about the finale, but my google game might be off today."

AskReddit,fcnh2tt,t1_fcndnag,1577811562.0,Same here. I‚Äôve gone back to songs I wrote a decade ago and either have to throw them out or completely rewrite some of the cringey stuff.
