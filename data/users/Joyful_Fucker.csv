Knitting will make you happy for life! 
Your work looks great. Keep Going!"
dogs,fez20wy,t3_eqxx8s,1579453124.0,"For the love of god, stay out of dog parks. 

Many owners there are complete fucking idiots when it comes to socializing dogs and actively monitoring their dogs behavior. And they sure as shit don’t prevent issues from arising. 

I’m sure they are a nice people, but they are clueless dog owners when it comes to dog behavior. And some owners are downright fucking negligent.

LifeProTips,fe314sr,t1_fdxbr1o,1578844905.0,Yep. As I said. There are no requirements to carrying equipment in the vehicle.
LifeProTips,fdvmfgt,t1_fdtch45,1578749019.0,"American police and fire response typically have first aid kits in their vehicles.  American citizens do typically do *not* have any type of first aid in their cars. Nor fire extinguishers.  (But we’re pretty big on huge soft drinks and snacks). I am unaware of any State inspection of any equipment in the vehicle beyond properly seat child safety chairs. States have “emission inspections” on vehicles, but there is no component requiring us to carry equipment in the vehicle itself.  I don’t recall there being any first aid questions or component to my initial driver testing either."

orangetheory,fdk2sta,t1_fdk0kpq,1578494667.0,"Hi! I can’t help you out wirh the ACL other than telling you I know a dozen people who have had theirs repairs and have no regrets.  I can’t imagine an AO is good for your knee though. Ask your doctor, definitely, before you find yourself flying off the back of the treadmill because your knee simply collapsed and won’t bear weight. 

My nerve damage is from a spinal injury and I’ve also had multiple surgeries on the same foot with the nerve damage, so I’m a mess. :)

Lots of elitist whining going on in here. :)"
AskReddit,fdk19eo,t1_fdjek41,1578493552.0,"Hi. Do the best you can, and get out in your own as quickly as you can manage. There are people that absolutely cannot be helped, and you don’t have to be held hostage to their crazy. 
They are stomping in their own crazy shit, and are splashing it all over your shins.  Make sure you can walk away from it and shower it off rather then letting it stain you."
orangetheory,fdk07tn,t1_fdjyh1p,1578492778.0,"Brilliant!!! 

Just because it annoys or irritates me doesn’t make it the end of the world. *My experience isn’t actually more important than their experience.*

After surgery and nerve damage, I have a gait deficit and always will. I “list” to the left and bang my left wrist against the treadmill rail every 10 steps or so; it will always be that way. Can you imagine how shitty I would feel if one of my neighbors had opinions  about the fact that I actually can’t run in a straight line for more than a few feet and it annoys them? 

Y’all need to lighten the fuck up. Too many folks here sound like privileged assholes because they have to share the space with folks with other values and habits....  even through the class is designed to be shared by people with different values and habits. 

And yes, if your safety is threatened, then speak up immediately!"
dogs,fdg41qw,t3_el5ksp,1578379200.0,"Could take weeks to months, but it will happen.

Be absolutely consistent with your behavior about the crate (same times, same rituals) to build familiarly and reassurance.  And of course, never, ever, ever use the crate as punishment. 

Congrats on your new dog!"
TwoXChromosomes,fdfp8kz,t3_el0ef8,1578366927.0,"Report away! What an asshole!!!

(Do keep in mind that HR exists to protect to interest of the company, and not YOUR interest.  The company interest and yours may be aligned,  but if not, remember that HR is not looking out for you).

Sorry this happened and I’m glad you told him to stop objectifying you."
