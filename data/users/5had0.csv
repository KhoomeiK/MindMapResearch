Though the case was routinely mocked, the 3rd degree burns the woman received were horrific (not that I can think of a situation where 3rd-degree burns aren't). McDonald's knew the risk and had over 700 different previous reports of injuries resulting from their coffee's temperature and had even paid out some prior settlements on the issue. 

Then at the trial, it didn't help McDonald's case that their own witnesses seemed flippant about the whole thing, nor did it help that their own expert testified that the temperature they served the coffee at wasn't even safe for consumption.

They are playing to a crowd who is there to see someone else. A lot of people are starting to trickle in during their set and many times just having full fledge conversations with people while the opening act is playing.

There is something fundamentally unfair in that if the professor screwed up that you just need to live with it.

philosophy,fecdkko,t1_febsh0u,1578971382.0,"What the news reports as a ""loophole"" is many times a blatant constitutional violation.

Contrary to public opinion, it is exceptionally rare for a case to get tossed on a technicality such as, the judge mistakenly wrote ""the warrant shall be executed between 8pm and 8am"" vs ""8am and 8pm"" and the home was raided at 10 am. Does it happen? Sure. What is far more likely is that an officer searched the vehicle after coercing the client to give consent because he was too lazy to get a warrant.

I'm genuinely curious what you find prima facie morally wrong with that? 

I can think of few situations equally or more important to ensure that 'i's are being dotted and 't's are being crossed than in the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system can take away your freedom. It can seize your property. In some states it can take away your ability to vote. It can also put things on your record where a stupid mistake you made at 18 can close the door to many avenues of employment for your whole adulthood. 

I get it to a certain extent because I shared a similar view before law school. But I very quickly learned that the defendants aren't ""criminals"", they are actual people. They aren't just a mug shot, name, and brief description of the crime that made the local news. They are individuals trying to live their lives.

Here is the problem, at least in the US, most constitutional violations go unreported. That person driving home from work late at night who is stopped and illegally searched before being sent on their way because the officer didn't find anything, never thinks to call an attorney. So it really takes these ""bad actors,"" i.e. the ones where the cops found something, to make the case law and to keep the police accountable. 

If you want to get mad when a person caught with a trunk full of heroin goes free, that is fine. But your anger should not be directed at the defense attorney. Your anger should be pointed at the police or the prosecutor who screwed up. The reality is when the police and prosecutor does their job follows the law the guilty party is found guilty the overwhelming majority of the time."
philosophy,febs6pb,t3_eo8py5,1578962078.0,"This article is terrible. Essentially the author starts with the premise that it is ethically wrong to represent defendants , with no foundation, and then takes off from there. And instead of, I don't know, asking defense attorneys why they do what they do, the author ropes in a psychologist who jumps to defense attorneys being psychopaths or being diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, while mentioning the reasons that most defense attorneys take pride in their work as an aside. 

Before law school I used to question how people could be defense attorneys, now it is my primary practice area. I have had major cases thrown out due to illegal searches. I've seen the comments under the news articles, ""where is the justice? Stupid defense attorneys getting people off on technicalities is everything that is wrong with America!, etc."" But those nights I go home and sleep just fine. I sleep well because I know that officer will never violate the constitution the same way again. 

It's interesting how quickly people in the general public will say, ""I don't care if the search was illegal, they found drugs!"" But then don't stop and think, ""I wonder how many people that officer illegally searched, found nothing, and then sent on their way?"" 

I'm not one of those people that believe all police officers are terrible but I've seen some absolutely egregious misconduct. Typically it is the defense attorneys who bring this conduct into the light. Defense attorneys are one of the few lines of... defense... against this misconduct and typically the only real remedy is getting these cases thrown out. Enough cases get thrown out due to illegal searches or other violations and those officers are shown the door. 

But fundamentally the US justice system was founded on the idea that it is better for 10 guilty people to go free than to put 1 innocent person in jail. (I'm sure we've all seen different ratios there but the point stands.) Defendants are normally put in a david v goliath situation where they are facing down the immense resources on the state, so the burden of proof is tipped very far in the defendants favor. The idea that people are doing something unethical by helping people in those situations is absurd. 

Finally, to end my ramblings, the article fundamentally misstated the actual issue in dispute in a criminal case. It is NOT innocent vs. guilty. The question is whether or not the state can prove each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. A jury can wholeheartedly believe that the defendant committed the crime they were on trial on for but must find the defendant, ""not guilty"" if the state failed to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. ""Not guilty"" does not mean innocent. That is both my mind set and every other defense attorney I've ever spoken to mind sets when evaluating a case. What can the state prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt""? Innocence does not enter into that equation.

But he is so popular that obviously what/how he writes is hitting all the right notes with a lot of people, so obviously he is doing something right.

(steps up on my soap box) I can't stand it when people try to act like ""literary gate keepers."" Reading, even terrible books, is a great hobby for people to have. It strengthens people's imaginations, makes them process, confront, and manipulate other view points, it stretches their brains by teaching them new words, and has been shown to make people more empathetic overall. It also is a skill that you improve the more you do it and depending on the field of work the person is employed those skills can carry over. People do not get the same benefits from other types of media. 

But then people like you come along and say things that boils down to, ""what you enjoy is stupid and you're a joke for enjoying it!""

Or they end up trying to read the ""right"" books and despising them so they decide they don't like reading at all. Which is a shame. (steps off soapbox)

Many states, now, have laws addressing it. However many of the states require more than just, ""he showed the nudes without much permission.""

It is further complicated because we are constantly, ""shedding"" DNA as we move around and that DNA can stay on an object for a very long time. 

So to answer the question, yes it can transfer the DNA and mess things up. But typically, the gloves are there to minimize the officer's finger prints and DNA from getting onto objects, it's not foolproof, but it's also not feasible to send officers in hazmat suits every time they go to a crime scene. But as much as I like grandstand in court about it, these ""mess ups"" are rarely fatal to the case.

You incorrectly claimed that the moral of the story was that killing people was wrong. That is clearly not what the story said. You can read the whole story in about 5 minutes. Go and check my work. 

Please cite me to where I said that ""the Torah claims that kids should be killed at an alter."" I explicitly said there was a lot of god sanctioned killing  in the old testament. Do you maintain that is a false statement? 

How is it edgy to just quote the scripture and make, what I thought, was a pretty clearly undisputed fact about the old testament?"
todayilearned,fcjzez4,t1_fcivcu5,1577711587.0,"That is a nice attempt to hand wave away the actual horror of the story, but you should really read it again because it is not at all what happened in the story. It's actually pretty short. God told him Abraham to sacrafice his son, Abraham spent a few days preparing, lies to his son about what he was planning on sacrificing, then binds his son to prepare to kill him. The angel came down at the last second. The angel didn't come down and say, ""wtf don't kill people,"" instead the angel says, 
""'Do not lay a hand on the boy,"" he said. 'Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.'""

Then God gives makes a ram for him to sacrifice appear, abraham does it then God himself speaks out and essentially says, ""because you were willing to sacrifice your only son, I'm going to bless you, give you lots of decendents and you'll rule a large chunk of the world.""

The whole thing was a test for Abraham and an attempt to what type of blind faith god requires, not some ""wtf don't kill people"" message. The old testament is full of god sanctioned killing."

First you're presupposing that we are here for a reason and/or have a destiny. That is never a fair supposition to make. There may he absolutely no ""true meaning"" to our existence. There may also be absolutely no true meaning to why the aliens exist either. We very likely are just products of evolution."
AmItheAsshole,fcab31e,t1_fc8cfzm,1577565939.0,"Oh yes, CPS and police love receiving ""hypothetical"" calls revolving around a sexual nature. They totally won't assume the caller is downplaying what occurred and just look up where the phone call came in from. Then they totally won't come to the home and investigate further. Then if they decide the parents aren't telling the truth, they completely won't remove all the minors from the home immediately. But as everyone knows, placing children in a temporary foster home is super easy, especially when there are multiple children who are teenagers. 

But seriously, that is the absolute worst advice you could give this person. I practiced juvenile law for a bit and you do not call CPS unless you actually want/need them involved. I've seen kids ripped out of homes due to misunderstandings so quickly it made my head spin. Sure it all eventually got worked out, but it doesn't happen overnight. I cannot believe the number of upvotes your comment got. 

If she is so concerned about the legality of this, she can call an attorney. Playing the hypothetical game with the police or CPS is never a good idea."
ufo,fc9p4oc,t1_fc8fg6a,1577556044.0,"You would be very much surprised how often it happens in cases of domestic violence. An ""anonymous call"" comes in, typically from a neighbor, the police arrive and the woman is clearly just been assaulted but she is swearing up and down that nothing happened and this is all one big misunderstanding. Contrary to what TV has taught people, the victim of a crime doesn't get to choose whether or not to bring charges. 

The reason that this guy's story is clearly B.S. is that a DUI and domestic assault are both state charges that will be handled by a state prosecutor. So you need to believe that there are individuals, who have the highest level security clearance level decided to rope in not only local government law enforcement to set up a false arrest, also get local state prosecutors in on this fraud and charge him with two things that are likely misdemeanors. It will also require some serious pressure to be put on the members of the jury if it goes to trial and all this ""evidence"" was just made up. All of this, if he doesn't have a criminal record, is unlikely to lead to any jail time upon a conviction. 

It just doesn't make sense for the federal government to rope in that many people, any of whom could have blown the lid on the operation once they were approached, to just apply pressure to this guy.  There are a million other easier ways to get better results if that is what they really wanted to do than fabricate two relatively minor state charges."

The better play, though still super petty, is to no show at the wedding, do everything you just said, but don't tag anyone in the posts. The bride, groom, and bridesmaids will all still see the posts because they are friends with her and they'll notice they aren't there but it'll leave the bride wondering if she actually caused the two to get together."
