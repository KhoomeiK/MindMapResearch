That's what I'm telling you. His audience is becoming sick of it. The constant barrage of ignorance and hate being thrown at him by breadtube is polarizing his audience against you. Pewdiepie has 102 million subscribers and every time someone makes a faux controversy all he needs to do is point out how ignorant and false it is and it makes leftube/mainstream news look like fools to everyone watching. 

Using weak arguments makes your side look weak and petty and polarizes people against you. Stop crying wolf

And I called pigpuncher ""nazipuncher"" because his name is needlessly polarizing, hateful, and ignorant. To me with his 16k subs he looks like someone who's put on a mean name in order to hop on the reactionary hate bandwagon and get his name out there. Look at his video lists, it's all hate streams and reactionary clickbait. This guy is no Shawn, ThreeArrows, or bomberguy. He's more akin to left wing  blackpidgeonspeaks or nobullshit. 

It's possible to dislike the other side without becoming it and adopting its flaws. We shouldn't be promoting these people"
BreadTube,fczlypg,t1_fcywei5,1578104126.0,"Sure! Contra said being a public figure removes your ability to be a messy person and vent frustration. You're forced to always take a step back and craft a perfect response in stressful scenarios. Yelling an insult at someone shooting at you is an example of lashing out under stress. 

Contra also talked about being canceled for having a 10-second clip of buck angel reading a line in one of her videos. Pewdiepie promoted one of E;R's reviews in a list of other creators, and the ""transitive property"" of guilt that she talks about in her videos applies here as well. Contra wanted a voice for a line, and Pewdiepie liked the review. Neither went deep into the controversies surrounding these figures before adding 10 seconds to their videos. 

And the never forgiveness/mask slipping aspect. Despite Pewdiepie's hundreds of hours of footage, you choose to focus on the 30 seconds of controversy and refuse to accept his many explanations, disavowments, and apologies he has made.

You're so caught up in the hatejerk that you refuse to reflect upon your actions and lash out when someone holds a mirror up to you. I'd imagine you'd forgive Contra or James much faster than Pewdiepie because your hate is still ongoing"
