depression,ff96u1b,t3_esbcpa,1579706214.0,"It confuses me when a woman says these things because I feel the same way, but as a man I think ALL women wants the most ""perfect"" man they can find and I'm nowhere near perfect. Honestly, the only way we can be in good place in our minds is by accepting ourselves just the way we are, and I'm saying this because honestly I have 0 friends, I've never had a love relationship and if I spend my time trying to pick every damn imperfect thing about myself I will fall deeper in a dangerous state of mind that will only bring me sorrow and despair. You, op, you are perfect, don't let your mind or other people break you down, you deserve love and happiness and I wish you an incredible day!"
ForeverAlone,ff6qlyn,t3_erwf9r,1579632830.0,"I was in a similar situation, I fell in love with someone that I thought was different (She didn't care about social media as much as most girls do, she didn't care about makeup as she was very pretty in my eyes) but In the end, the only different person was me. She was just like another girl I've tried to be FRIENDS with, always treating me like a last resort In case she needed something, never looking at me in eye, always laughing with her true friends... I ended up alone, completely lost and blind, I don't know if I will ever find a friend, but today the only friend I have is me."

I can only appreciate people from a distance, no love or other emotions, and I hate this... I hate that I came to a point in life that I can't trust other people... They always let me down..."
