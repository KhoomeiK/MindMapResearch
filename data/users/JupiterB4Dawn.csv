I would imagine that when they do put you under it's *also* so you dont move or panic randomly or in response to the sounds and smells of yourself being operated on."

The second picture by itself it's not as noticable. But,  one ear is still down. It looks like something might've caught it's attention making it's ear perk up. 

But in neither picture does the dog turn towards her or lean towards her, only away. It looks like he was trying to just ""deal"" but the last straw was the arm around his neck."

Watercolor,fe5251t,t3_enjl39,1578865020.0,This looks great! My only critique would be  the building is too pale in color. I would maybe try to go over it again to make them more saturated. The sky looks dark but the building looks like it's in really bright sunshine or something. I do think the sky came out really cool and I like the way you did the brick pattern

explainlikeimfive,famjvvn,t3_e9sjow,1576205628.0,">Why did cyan and magenta replace blue and red as the standard primaries in color pigments? 

Painters used ""true"" blue and red because 1) the pigments are easier to obtain in nature 2) people were still learning how color works 3) R and B were good enough to recreate the majority of colors around them. The range of missing colors (like magenta, bright purples, oranges etc) arent often needed in paintings of natural subjects.

>What exactly makes CMY(K) superior to the RYB model?

It's ""superior"" because you can create more colors with that system. As others have said- you can mix M with Y and C to make R and B and many other colors you can't get with RYB. RYB makes ""muddier"" colors. I put superior in quotes because many painters still use an RYB palette, because it's easier to make those duller, earthier colors. Modern printers need to make ALL the colors though. 

>And why did yellow stay the same when the other two were updated?

They just had yellow correct from the beginning. Again- they work as primaries for many many colors. Just needed a bit of refining to get more."
