He is allowed on the furniture, will try it after a long walk so he is tired"
Dogtraining,fe1ywee,t1_fe1yl0h,1578832507.0,"Good idea, he likes to chew on thing.
I would never force him when i see he doesn't want to, maybe when he gets older he is still hyper most of the time
Thanks for the advice"

Seems like a great dog :)"
Dogtraining,fdzefa9,t1_fdzdadk,1578789419.0,"Make it into a game when she catches you then you chase her :D its a lot of fun. 

You can try putting some treats in the toy, that might work if she doesn't know what to do with it.
Happy to hear you are giving so much attention to your dog now that you have the time :)"
Dogtraining,fdza9uk,t1_fdz9z7a,1578788203.0,"Just an idea, you could get a Frisbee that way you dont have to run too much :)"
Dogtraining,fdz9z7a,t1_fdz8u37,1578788111.0,Maybe a game of chase or tag would help with that much energy?
Dogtraining,fdz9opd,t3_enfqro,1578788011.0,"How about waving, shake hand or a simple high 5?
I used a "" hi"" command insted of wave ( in my language hi and bye are the same word) so its ridiculously cute when he waves back to people. 

I am Tring to teach my dog how to bow, they say it's basic tho my dog really disagrees"
Dogtraining,fdz6jz2,t3_eneu9v,1578787164.0,"I would suggest walking back multiple times, for instance 5 min into your walk turn around and start walking home then turn back to original direction and after 10 min turn around again etc, i think that way she wont know if she is going home for sure and treat her everytime she turns to go back, i also give my dog a treat as soon as we get home so going home is also fun for him.

Your dog seems to be enjoying longer walks :) try running with her or letting her run in a dog park, exercise more like the other comment said. Good luck, hope this help!"
NonZeroDay,fdop87g,t1_fdollt7,1578609802.0,"Yup, same with learning drawing skills. Hope to get rid of those old patterns"
Dogtraining,fdojhnf,t1_fdn1anx,1578606399.0,"Hey i wanted to update this, we just did it with two staircase. This is what i did, i tried with him going up one step up then down that was my first part of the training today. after about 2hrs i came back with a friend and his dog, he saw the dog go down the stair after that i went with my dog to the bottom of the stairs, he got on the first step i reworded him when he came down then i walked with him to the second and came down and again reworded him and so on until the top of the staircase and down. He got scared at the start i ignored him and let him see there was nothing to be afraid, waited until he was calm walked away and then came back to the staircase. Hope it helps! :)"
NonZeroDay,fdoin9w,t1_fdogxl1,1578605911.0,"Thank you for the answering, really appriciate it.

Dogtraining,fdognh0,t1_fdof8fz,1578604762.0,We just did it walked down after following q dog!! SO PROUD
Dogtraining,fdof8fz,t1_fdob7ph,1578603980.0,"That is so true it is scary when you look down the stairs like some people are afraid of really high escalators.

My building steps have 5 steps these other ones are 7 steps and the shape and material is the same the length of the step is the same, i am thinking of getting there at like 4-5am to practice without distractions and with some really nice chicken treats and in the afternoon he can see his dog friends going down the stairs, he might want to follow he is super friendly.
Btw thank you for all the advice, appreciate it"
Dogtraining,fdo3eo9,t1_fdo0fpm,1578598164.0,"I am in the center of the city with a lot of cars going everywhere and dog parks where i can let him run free have no stairs.
I tried today to get him to up and down from the stairs and we managed one step. 
I'll take a pic of the stairs that i have to go around everyday when i take him on his next walk.
It might be the leash thing, the stairs he was ok with he did not have a leash since it was an enclosed area. 
Do you think having him see other dogs go down the stairs would help?"
NonZeroDay,fdntzzm,t1_fdnttle,1578592802.0,"Awesome, let's do it :)"

Dogtraining,fdn6cru,t1_fdn64ho,1578578512.0,"Great idea, thank you! We are going to the park and there is a staircase with about 7 steps will practice going up one step then down one step. Do i practice just one or two? I dont want to overwhelm him"
Dogtraining,fdn5qp5,t1_fdn56ml,1578578039.0,"Thank you for the answer, such a nice and positive way to solve the problem :) 
i tried all of it he is so weird about it, this summer we went on vacation and had really long outdoor cement stairs which he decided is ok to go up and down on and indoor again cement stairs that he refused to go up or down on, now he goes up on all stairs and refuses to go down so we take 10-15 min detours to go home. 
He seems selective of the stairs? 

Lured him with chicken with toys with dog treats had a friend hold the leash while i called him to come down and all he did was go backwards"
Dogtraining,fdn1h5l,t1_fdn1anx,1578574388.0,"Hope we find a solution, it is not so easy with big dogs that you cannot just carry up the stairs

I love that show, its over 10 years old but they are posting videos on YouTube every week some with her comments on how the dog training changed since it was first shot like how the whole concept of being the pack leader was totally wrong and discredited by the very scientist who came up with it 
Really recommend it"

What tricks do they know?
Mine is not the brightest when it comes to whats ok to eat he will regularly try to steal my clothes or towels to tear them apart and in the process eat a few pieces but on the flip side he made me super organized with my clothes. Dogs are hilarious"

Dogtraining,fddf0vw,t3_ek7g6s,1578309288.0,I think you should just first use the clicker with treats no other command until he starts associating the click with the treats he gets then start using the clicker with other commands

You can flip the narrative in your head, feel all the negative but still be grateful that you had her for such a long time.
I hope when you feel the time is right you will get or rescue another dog so you can again have someone very happy to see you everytime you come home.
This sucks, i really hope that the neighbour had nothing to with it"
DOG,fd9h8va,t1_fd9g68l,1578233329.0,"Go over any footage that might have cought her if there is any.
You should get one pointing to the yard to be safe in future both for kids and another pet is you decide to get one.
Getting over it is honestly not how it goes, i dont know how attached you were to the dog but dealing with the guilt we all feel as pet owners when something like that happens takes time"
DOG,fd9f3et,t1_fd9ec77,1578232542.0,"Have seen a lot of people killing dogs and cats with no remorse. Just 20 minutes ago a guy threatening to kick my dog.

Your best bet is to an autopsy ( not sure what the word is) if you can. 
What you described doesnt sound natural to me."
DOG,fd9dszr,t3_ejv5zf,1578232051.0,"Street dogs are scary when you sense agression.
If you run into a lot of street dogs who may attack you get some pepper spray just in case.

Exposure therapy for getting rid of the fear.
Start small, maybe just being in the same area as a dog until you feel comfortable then move on to either being closer to a dog or just petting him gradually increase.
Just how i got over some fears, hope ot helps!"
DOG,fd9cz98,t1_fd5z84b,1578231608.0,"Can you go and look if there was any more of it scattered around that she did not eat? Maybe she placed multiple to make sure? It's an awful feeling, my cat died similar to that few months ago. I hope you feel better soon."
