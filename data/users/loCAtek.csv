PoliticalDiscussion,fglitf4,t1_fglhdab,1580899945.0,The biggest problem with that is: Al Qaeda or ISIS were not countries Congress could declare war on.       Many of them (Like OBL) were from Saudi Arabia; should Congress have considered going to  war against Saudi Arabia?
PoliticalDiscussion,fglhayk,t1_fglh2ym,1580897726.0,Are you suggesting ISIS should have been left unchecked?
PoliticalDiscussion,fglgiis,t1_fglf63o,1580896579.0,"Granted, but it began as a subsect of Al Qaeda which splintered off in 2014, with many former Al Qaeda members.        So, in going after 9/11 terrorists, they had to be followed into ISIS."
PoliticalDiscussion,fgleqfd,t1_fgleh2w,1580893942.0,"Could you be more specific and name some of these 'things'?       I do recall Obama killing OBL, but that's what AUMF was meant for.

As for not limiting Trump; it's obvious he's provoking Iran and selling US troops to Saudi Arabia.       That's being a terrorist, not fighting terrorism."

PoliticalDiscussion,fgjxfvl,t1_fgju8rn,1580853273.0,"Not exactly, the GOP has become a cult, that puts party above the constitution; the DNC still follows the law, and does oversight as per the constitution.        That's not partisanship; that's the due process of law enforcement; in others words- Dems do their elected job."
PoliticalDiscussion,fgjw86m,t1_fgjuo24,1580852597.0,"If you had watched the Inquiry or the Trial, you would have been educated on the evidence for the articles of Impeachment.        There would have been far more evidence had the Administration not obstructed the release of documents, and the testimony of witnesses; which thereby supported the article of Impeachment- Obstruction of Congress.

GOP did not deny that there was wrongdoing by Trump, they simply put party above country."
CPTSD,fgjud4k,t3_eytx42,1580851563.0,"I have it too, and heard it's a symptom of stress, not lack of sleep.       CPTSD is being in a constant state of 'fight or flight' which keeps the body flooded with cortisol, the stress hormone.       Always being under stress can be exhausting, as you are aware.
Vitamin B-12 is helpful for some people, for that.        I'm not a doctor, so this is just a suggestion.       You may want see your doctor, and see what treatments there are for stress, not sleep."

AmItheAsshole,fghbpkf,t3_eyeje1,1580781261.0,"Just my two cents to add, another red flag was the claim: he needed to 'save you' - That's a  classic Narcessistic tactic; to claim that they're gaslighting in order to 'save' or 'help' you.
If any Redditers hear this from a potential partner, even if it's just a grooming tip, or attire suggestion; back up fast.       As mentioned, they are seeking the control over you and a common way to slip it under the radar is in the guise of 'help'.

Watch out for back-handed compliments like; 'You're very pretty, but you could be gorgeous with the right make-up.""

AskReddit,fgh49gq,t1_fgfzpef,1580776334.0,"Read this far, just for this movie.        Went in not knowing how damn long it was going to be, but I thought if it had Glenn Close in it, it would have to be good.        Tales of the lives of the fairy tale characters, after the interesting story part has happened.       So, a soap opera that turns interesting magical creatures into average people with boring problems.       They even age in the film, that's how long it is.       Worse (much worse) than those Disney shows about the lives of storybook characters, as it's humorless and takes itself way too seriously.     Bleh"
AskReddit,fgh2grx,t1_fggtfx1,1580775112.0,"This movie started the whole 'found footage' genre; if you believed it was real then it was pretty scary.
One Halloween, my partner and I told our young teenager that BW was a documentary and they weren't acting.       Even with lights on, he was getting highly freaked out, demanding to know, ""This is real!?       This is real!?""

So, we gave in and told him it was all acting.       After a moment of great relief, he was all bluster and bravado-   ""Oh, this is dumb.           You can tell this is fake, ha-ha!"""
