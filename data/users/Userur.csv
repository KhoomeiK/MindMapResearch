They betray so many people that genuinely care about them. And I think it just boils down to a matter pf scarcity vs abundance. Just like how a person living with a great abundance of food and clean water is likely to take it for granted and waste it, so too will a person with an abundance of potential romance, like a woman that is a penis magnet. She has so many options that she ultimately overlooks the value of each, and simply bases her love off of what she can get. Just like how a spoiled person will waste resources that deprived people would love to have a fraction of, a person with an abundance of romance will do the same with relationships. But it isnt love.

But I think that the underlying motivation is what set the difference. That motivation behind the renaissance painters still exists among artists today. For example, photographers will often use different kinds of filters, and editing software in order to make their images look more surreal and cinematic, but that doesn't necessarily make it 'real.' It's reality with a kind of flare. But I agree with your statement, and honestly I need to put more thought into it. You made a good observation."

Viewing them from this perspective can help alleviate the effects of the fear. The impulse to react to them is something evolutionary, and from this reaction we develop our perception of spiders, and use them as analogues for vice, depicting them as being evil in movies like lord of the rings. But this phenomena of being incredibly afraid of a certain type of creature isnt specially human. There are other animals primates and non primates that have evolved fears like that with regard to other animals. This phenomena is millions of years old. These days, arachnophobia isnt very necessary as we have more limited interactions with spiders, as compared with our wild ancestors. It is a wild instinct that still exists in us, even though we dont live in the wild."
Thoughts,feais1z,t1_feahkrx,1578949345.0,"I understand and often feel the same. I was just delving into the reason behind the fear. If no spider was ever venomous, then no trait to be afraid would be developed. We aren't thr only animals that has fears like this of other animals. And it is something we are born with. There was an experiment done in Germany where they took babies about 6 months to 1 year old and showed them pictures of different animals. Then they measured the dilation in their eyes. The greater the dilation the greater the stress response. When they were showed pictures of fish and birds, dilation was much smaller than when they were showed pictures of spiders and snakes. The babies didn't scream or cry, but when a child or adult sees one and screams, accompanying the scream is the same eye dilation. So technically the baby had the same reaction. But this isnt solely a human phenomena. And if no spiders were ever venomous, then you would not get the fear and creepy impulses you presently get."

Something I have considered doing is bringing him over to my apartment. I told him if he gets kicked out of the motel I will take him in."
SuicideWatch,fdo1hyg,t3_em54sj,1578597156.0,"First, I am sorry that you are struggling like this. It isn't fair to you. While I am not indian, I don't believe that such thinking has to do with indian culture, as such thinking can and has arisen in cultures throughout the world. It is rather a human tendency, one that can be seen in an individual case, as well as in a broader case like a society. A social problem runs parallel with an individual problem, just manifested in a bigger scale. I'll use an example,

I used to go to a school in a place called decatur. There I got bullied a lot, and often felt out of place. I felt like I was viewed as some kind of outcast that nobody would ever want to date, or be friends with. Granted I had some friends, the prevailing vibe was negative. There was one guy that left a scar in me emotionally I still have. He would gossip about me in front of me to other people, and tell me that nobody likes me. One statement he said that struck me deep was ""making friends is a skill, one that you just lack."" That statement among other things left a scar in me emotionally. When I left that school district and went to another school, things changed in my life. I made meaningful friends, and fell in love with a girl. Now the love that I had for her, which I expressed with the utmost romanticism, was a reaction to the scar I received in decatur, as her loving me is a contradiction to that prior state of being. A contradiction to those that hurt me. And so I cherished her. She cheated on me, and I forgave her that same day. And I would hold onto her through thick or thin. So that change in my life, became a big part of my identity and served as a source of motivation. And it did so because it was a contradiction in the positive sense to an experience I had prior in decatur.

But from that same contradiction came a fear. A fear that I would return to that prior state, of being left out and seen as socially inferior. Anything associated with decatur high became something I feared. Having ocd, I would even wash my hands after touching my backpack I used there. And if I had to go to decatur, I would leave my cellphone at home, because I feared that by bringing it my relationship would end. I would stop communicating with people that had any affiliation with decatur. And whenever my mother would ask me to go shopping at the store we go to in decatur, since we live just outside of it, I would go to another store in a different area. Get the same things, just not in decatur. Now why did I go to all these great extents? I did so because I feared a return to that state of being. To how I was, and to how I was viewed or treated. In runs right through the center of my being, and it was also from that same place and reasons that I loved my ex the way I did. It was a response to an existential fear. Scaling up, a society can react in the same way to a scarring it experiences. And the nature of the scarring determines the nature of the reaction. I think that this aspect of indian society is a reaction to historical events. Being viewed as being lesser than, and from that wounding develops the need to prove otherwise. I think that if you went to india 300 years ago, aside from the vast technological difference, such a phenomena wouldn't exist. That serves as motivation, but then the fear kicks in in order to keep that response going even when it isn't necessary. And when indian people immigrate to america, and see the prosperity or potential thereof, attaining that is a contradiction in the positive sense to the prior state of being, hence being impoverished. 

I don't think this is uniquely indian or asian. This is a human phenomena, a collective reaction not unlike the kind of reaction I had to my experience in decatur, but just in a different context and obviously scale. Just like how an individual, like myself, obsessed with the things that were or represented a contradiction to the prior undesired state, a society will collectively, but unconsciously, become obsessed with the things that also promise or represent a positive contradiction to the prior undesired state, or a continuation of the current contradiction. All obsessions though are based on fear. A similar kind of obsession would be americas obsession with capitalism, and their irrational fear of communism. This fear developed a century ago when big business owners in countries like the us, and other imperialists at the time saw the concept of communism as being threatening to their hegemony, since the underpaid, poorly treated people working under them would see it as a means of getting justice and leveling the playing field. Revolutions by communists occurred, like as the case with the soviet union, though all communist revolutions began as hummanitarian, and eventually became authoritarian, since they vested too much power in government. Something that also furthened the wests fears. And so the U.S. set off on a campaign of brainwashing their citizenry into thinking anything that has to do with socialism and communism is bad. And as such, bernie sanders gets called communist whenever he tries to bring about certain reforms that exist in other capitalist countries. There are so many other possible analogies to different societal obsessions, like the leftist american obsession with social justice. It is taking a virtue and obsessing about it until that virtue turns into something unhealthy and detrimental. But such phenomena isn't because of which part of the world the people come from, it is purely human nature. 

Those are just my thoughts on this."
OCD,fdnz5jj,t1_fdnqsgq,1578595806.0,"One thing I forgot to mention though was when I tried to invoke the analogy, I told him before hand that it isn't to the same extent as his experience. I never EQUATED it. I didn't go straight off the bat with it. It was wrong nonetheless, but I didn't ""equate"" anything. I tried to invoke an analogy in order to talk about dealing with a certain kind of feeling. Obviously, the two are different, and because the extents are so much different, it wouldn't be helpful anyway. It was wrong though and I did apologize to him yesterday about that, and admitted that it was wrong to invoke such. And I agree that just being a listening ear is better. He needs someone to vent out to, which is what he was trying to do last night. I should've listened and offered validation, as opposed to trying to invoke anything."

OCD,fdnhzcr,t3_em5ejl,1578586202.0,"Yesterday I was talking to a man that I often talk to. He was dealing with a lot especially as his wife of 25 years had died in 2019. Don't get me wrong, he has a shit ton on his plate. But when I tried helping him, he lashed out and just said there is no comparison between my problems and his. But trust me, my shit has made me incredibly depressed. It has sucked the life out of life. And the difference between our problems is that, with him, almost everyone will give him sympathy for dealing with his loss. Which don't get me wrong is devastating. But my suffering is practically silent. Very few people have actually looked at me and said, I can see you are struggling. But the ones that have made me feel freer like all the weight has been lifted off my shoulders. He could've just said I'm not helping. He was depressed, but I have talked to him many times and listened to him. And I have given him a total of 52 dollars, 20 one time to help him with his motel rent, and 32 for him to be able to buy his son a state id. To just lash out at me like that really fucking hurts, especially since I am dealing with issues that he probably won't give any validation for. And my ex doesn't have to be dead for it to matter. Betrayal in love can hurt just as much, maybe more. He didn't want to hear me out. Looking back, I should've just listened and given validation, as that is probably what he needed. But I am sick of this entitlement in our society where if you experience such and such, you can be a dick, and are not morally responsible. I'm not saying he is a dick, he's a great man with a big heart that is in a lot of distress. He's my friend. But to lash out at me like my feelings don't matter and are invalid, really hurt."

I did this one time with a girl that was working at s different place. A whole bunch of plastic ramnicans fell on the floor, and she picked them up and filled them with ketchup. I told the chef that an employee did interject the rest of what happened. When he asked who, I said I don't know the name. I did that because I didn't want to screw over that employee. I tried talking to the high school guy, but he doesn't understand. He thinks it's okay, or just says yes and then goes back to skipping steps. But I know he needs the money, the older gentleman, a very nice man, also needs the money. I can't explain it to him as he doesn't speak english. Maybe I should've told one of the managers that speaks spanish to explain to him not to stack them. I got the idea of doing this after talking to a dishwasher from a place across the street who said that he is on good terms with another dishwasher there, but that dishwasher stacks stuff on top of each other and doesn't understand when he explains to him not to do so.

Honestly, of all positions in a restaurant, assuming the same pay for each, I would take dishwasher. If you stack metal containers on top of each other, like how they would be when you put them on the shelf, and run them through the machine, the only thing that will get washed is the interior of the one on the bottom, and the exterior of the one on the top. It is honestly really stupid to wash them like that. But at the same time, they are good people in heart, unlike most people there, especially in the front end. I really like them, I don't want them to get fired. It just irritates me, because they get off scott free for not doing their job, yet I have literally taken shit for not breaking health code.

Yes, it is good to know that i did my part. And I try to remind myself of that. But I know that justice will never be served. it's one story if this was someone I don't care about. I work for a man that is not only verbally abusive, but shows work place favoritism in the open, and actually stole money from me, something that was informed to me by another manager. I have anger towards him, but it vaporizes very quickly. I remember after he mistreated me one day, I came back to work hoping he was there because I was going to blast on him, and he wasn't. Instead, I spoke to another manager about it, and got those feelings off my chest. And he gave me validation. When I later saw that abusive manager at work, I would have to force myself to say something. An the reason why is I don't care about him, and he doesn't have any place in my life. She meant about as much to me as someone's sibling would to them. I loved her with all my heart, I screwed up nonetheless. And if she doesn't want to be with me because of my flaws and failures, that's fine. I apologized for where I went wrong at the end. But she instead lied, and covered up her flaws and intentions, and even scapegoated me. And then she ran off with someone else. She always makes sure she has another relationship lined up, actually even started, before leaving another. She did that with me. She lined me up when another relationship was ending. She doesn't spend any time in between reflecting on it. And when I wasn't in her life, she basically got used by other men, and then she blamed me for that because I wasn't there, even though I ""wasn't there."" I wasn't a part of her life during x time. And the way she blamed me was in the same fashion that some women that try to falsely accuse someone of harrassment use a pitty show of tears, that is exactly what she did. Despite how much bullshit those tears came with. And it is her never taking responsibility for that, and scapegoating me, and then telling me I no longer choose you I choose someone else, guy x. This is crushing. Granted, if my life had a purpose I wouldn't be hurting nearly as badly. But my life has no purpose, all I do is clean after people at a place I don't care about, to pay for another place I don't care about. In the absence of anything to live for, I am stranded in this experience. Everyday trying to deal with it. And it's been 8 months. This was a person that was deeply tied to my own sense of self. For her, it probably is paper fiction. I'm sure she's enjoying fucking whatever dude she's with, never batting at eye at her own flaws and failures. And always trying to mask that shit by brushing it under the rug of negligence and time, and fucking more bastards she chooses but blames on others. But inspite of all that, I still love her. I wish she would send me something. She was the greatest source of inspiration in my life. No amount of her own flaws are enough to steer me away. She one time at the beginning of our relationship 5 and a half years ago, cheated on me by viewing a video of a friend of hers dancing and stripping. I forgave her that same night, granted I spoke to her earlier in the day with the support of a close friend. She gave me memories I look back to in order to come home in my heart. And without the purpose I once had, and with all the crap that exists in my life, I am stranded in pain. Whilst, she goes and fucks around and goes to a carnival etc. etc. And never realizes how hurt I truly am."

AskReddit,fcytjrd,t1_fcyrz43,1578086772.0,"The event occurred 8 months ago. I am still every bit as hurt now as I was then. I don't know if time alone will bring me the closure I need. The amount of contradictions she made on herself, and treating me like a repleacable object is gnawing away at my soul. Especially since she was such a big part of my life. I would move on if I had a sense of purpose, but I have no purpose. I used to have a sense of purpose that got robbed from me by a combination of my ocd and a number of other issues in my life. I can try to reignite the flame, but it feels like there is something that must be done first. Yes, I want to move on. I want to set some goals for myself and move forward in my life. I already did part of that. I recently got my first apartment, a goal I set for myself last year. I worked towards it and eventually through dedication achieved it. But even that hasn't gotten rid of the pain inside."

unpopularopinion,fcy56ol,t1_fcxdw46,1578074991.0,"I agree that you have the power to control it, but that power comes from an awareness that comes with time and through experiencing being completely affected by what others say or think. Also, getting to that point where you have power over those emotions takes experiencing something or enough of something in your life that brings you the sense of self and confidence required to detach from most opinions of others. Whenever I dismiss of the opinions of others, I usually do so by remembering memories and experiences, and thinking of people that bring me back home inside, all of which is the result of things that have occurred outside of me. So while we do have that control, the getting to the point where you have that control is dependent on experiences with other people that are outside of you. Another observation I have made is people will ask questions they know the answer to not because they seek that answer, but because they seek the power that comes from hearing someone else answer a question about matters that have long affected them. In other cases, someone may be dealing with self doubt, knows the answer to a dilemma but requires the emotional boost of hearing someone else give that same answer."

depression,fcr1qfs,t3_eieavt,1577895499.0,"I hate holidays because in my family it is a time to brush actual matters under the rug and pretend to be content for the sake of tradition. All the adverse experiences, all the years of emotional distance, all the dysfunction, and depression. All of the matters that make me feel uneasy become invalid because it is christmas. Or new years. Or thanksgiving. And every holiday always leaves me feeling confused. Sitting down with my dad, somebody I share a lot of issues with, that I almost never talk to, and pretending that such problems do not exist, talking about things I like which makes me confused given all the underlying dissonance. All the emotional complexity. Right now they have pie, but I am not in the mood for any of that. Yet my mood doesn't matter. My mother will demand that I eat that pie. At least a slice. Because they got it, because of tradition. But fuck the tradition. If we aren't a healthy family on normal days, we aren't a healthy one on a holiday. A holiday is just another fucking day. Food is especially triggering for me as that is the primary source of dysfunction in my family. And working at a restaurant only makes it more complicated. It never fails to leave me confused and uneasy, in search of some sense of self that will never come. All because of holiday."
Advice,fcplvuv,t1_fcpjvvh,1577867154.0,"Right now it just feels deeply awkward. I recently moved out of my parents home, but I never talked to him about my plans to move. From his perspective, I just randomly moved. When I did talk to him, it is always dry. Like how you would talk to your manager. I act polite, but emotionally withdrawn. Deep down, I know this most likely hurts him. I feel terrible about it, but I have so many conflicting feelings regarding everything that's happened it is very hard for me to bring myself to discuss these matters. And he has done some strange and creepy things that have also furthered that distance, and is likely his reaction to the distance. But nonetheless, it is deeply emotionally complicated. When I talk to him, my desire to not feel depressed about not talking drives me to talk, which makes me feel okay, but then later on with this deep uneasiness. What about all this other stuff. All the creepy memories. My moving out. All the dysfunctional time that has passed. Every conversation leaves me with this deep uneasiness. I just don't know where to start in fixing this shit."
