Guaranteed loans created this problem and Democrats are not going to to fix it because education is the lefts big business. Also, getting rid of debt would screw banks, or taxpayers and the Dems would screw taxpayers before banks. Then healthcare, only radicals are taking about M4A now, the lobbyists got to the Dems.

The only reason anyone is taking about MFA and student Debt is because Bernie almost won, well did win, on it. Party Democrats realize that they need to talk the same talk but we had a Democrat in office with a Democrat majority 7 years ago. Nothing has changed since Obama was in office with majorities and he didn't try to tackle either.

Either way, recent reports show Trump with 30% support in the Black Community. I know the study is contested but the point remains, most people judge a president on the economy because like I said earlier, people recognize that regardless of the party in power little actually changes for the average American. Over the last 60 years, each party has held enough power to do as they wish and little has changed. 

People see Bernie as an outsider and rightly so, he doesn't belong in the Democratic party. Now as much as I would live to see the reforms he is promoting, Congress is still controlled by the elites and like the Republicans with Obamacare, it's easy to posture and declare that you are going to do something when you have no power to do so, but when it comes to actually voting to eliminate billions in debt or getting rid of a trillion dollars healthcare industry, I guarantee they will not vote against the interest of their donors."

They have work and children to raise and thus bigger things to worry about than a bunch of rich white people arguing on stage, where most of what they say are lies. The other day, 3 of the smartest people in the country couldn't identity a picture of Adam Schiff on Jeopardy, most Americans are not clued in.

Sure Biden had more support right now, but only because of Obama, I guarantee most people who don't pay attention to politics cannot articulate a single difference between the 3 front runners. So, they support Biden because of name recognition and the media links Biden to a hero of the black community, Obama. Just like when Obama was elected, the narrative is he didn't have black support until he won Iowa, no, most black people didn't even know who Obama was until he won Iowa because his press coverage BLEW UP. 

My point at last, who cares about how much black support Biden has, support doesn't matter, getting people out to vote is what matters; and it's obvious that Biden is not going to get blacks out to vote like Obama did. So, while they are an important voting block,Obama win because he got a lot of blacks to the polls who normally could have cared less about politics. We have Trump because Americans are starting to realize that politicians are a ruling class of people who are all currupt. Many Bernie supporters something like 20% voted for Trump after he lost the primary. If Bernie wins the primary, a lit of Trump's support will disappear, peole are tired of the establishment. 

I was laughing at the anger over CNNs treatment of Bernie, like you people think a multinational company like CNN is going to support a populist who wants to overthrow the elites and brjng power back to the people.
