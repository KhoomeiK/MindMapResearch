If that's what you took away from this then you are incredibly naive.

Rational people prioritize issues. 15k people were murdered with guns last year. No sane person would prioritize stopping gun murders over saving the 25k-50k people who die due to lack of health insurance, the 100k people who die due to pollution, the countless people who die due to poverty, the suicides due to mental health problems, and so on and so forth. And none of that takes into account the shitty quality of life and the destruction of the middle class that the Democrats could also fix.

If your goal is to save as many people as possible- then you prioritize the things that are actually killing the majority of people and I'm sorry but that's not guns. At the same time- fixing all the above issues would ALSO help stop gun violence so it's win-win. Gun suicides would go down if we had better mental healthcare. Gun murders would go down if we had less income inequality, better education, and a better social safety net.

> Pressure is typically anywhere from 0.5 to 3.5 bars, even more if it's a larger house, flow also has to be faster

So no- you don’t need “thick” pipes and it’s not easier to redirect air around because you need a lot more of it.

Primary and alternate second stages over the _left_ shoulder and LPI over the right? It looks like the primary second stage is set up for a left side feed (unless that’s not actually the exhaust port I think I see on top) but I could be mistaken and the turret just needs to be rotated. 

Also why is the rotating part of the turret on top? Generally you want it on the bottom so the hoses stay tucked in nice and close and won’t snag on anything.

Is this just an Australian configuration that I’m unfamiliar with?

Also- how do you know this is Heliox? Heliox is pretty rare even in advanced technical diving due to the cost (e.g. I use trimix all the time but never Heliox) so I’d be surprised to see someone using it- let alone in a single tank configuration rather than a doubles setup (the long SPG and short alternate second stage suggests this is not half of a sidemount setup).

Has Amazon actually boosted the production of the whole system? What about the folks who invented the Internet? Their efforts were a LOT more important but none of them have been rewarded the way Bezos has.

Lots of brilliant people have come up with a lot of brilliant ideas over the years- but there is a huge amount of luck involved when creating the kind of wealth that Bezos enjoys. 10 years earlier and Amazon would not have been possible. If he didn't have the connections he made at Princeton and then in finance he wouldn't have been able to secure the capital necessary to run at a loss for years. Amazon was able to beat brick and mortar store pricing for years because they weren't required to collect sales tax- but a modern competitor doesn't have that advantage.

The point is that LOTS of people work just as hard, if not harder, than Jeff Bezos and will never have even a fraction of his money.
