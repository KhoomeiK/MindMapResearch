pcmasterrace,fftfphg,t1_fftdp9a,1580219229.0,"It's all just personal preference. If you can, go to a retail store and try the different kind of switches and how they feel.

Reds are linear (my current preference) and really light (45g actuation force). Blacks are just slightly heavier Reds. Reds are always advertised for gaming, because you can supposedly push them faster, but I'm using some extremely heavy switches right now (95g Kailh Ancient Grey) and have no problems.

The silent variants are just that, silent. It's not a huge difference, but noticeable.

Browns have a slight bump, that you feel when you push them down, but I really dislike that right now. The ones I have just feel kinda scratchy.

Blues have the click, that can sound really satisfying, but personally I like it more with some O-rings to dampen the sound. My first mech had Cherry Blues and I put some O-rings on there and it probably is still my favorite sounding one ever.

All of these types can have different variations (colors) that are slightly different. It's usually how much force / weight you need to put on them, before they trigger."

Finally done with the regular levels (on all difficulties), only the Abyss left. I think I will take a break from the game though. These last few weeks I have basically only played Nioh, but there is so much other stuff I want to try at least.

For the last few levels I was missing, I switched to the katana again. The much lower range compared to the odachi was weird at first, but I got used to it. I tried Iai Quickdraw for a bit, but didn't really get used to it. Flowing Shadow was still extremely strong though, especially if you can buff yourself / debuff the enemy and engage them while they are still in their spawn animation. I was just melting bosses.

I will still check back in with the game here and there, mostly to play coop, if my friend wants to. Maybe I'll take a shot at the Abyss before the sequel comes out on PC.

**Risk of Rain 2**

Only did a single run today as Rex and he seems kinda OP.

I unlocked him around Christmas, and only played him once or twice on normal back then, but I had absolutely no trouble with him. Today I tried to unlock the skin, so I had to play on hard, but again, it was a cakewalk. His huge amount of life leech just heals him back to full hp so quickly.

**Dicey Dungeons**

I played it for the first time today and only finished the first episode with the Warrior, but I'm not really feeling it.

Not sure what you mean about the speed being tied to the framerate. I played it again just a few months ago on a 144Hz screen and had no issues. The game is capped at 60 anyway, so you should not notice anything. There is a Berseria ""fix"" mod that can change some stuff, but I do not remember if you can unlock the framerate.

Games,fdar1mh,t3_ekdj09,1578249133.0,"**Nioh**

Apart from some last minutes placements in Overwatch, just Nioh all the time.

I just finished the main story on Way of the Wise (fourth difficulty) and unlocked the last one, Way of the Nioh. I will skip the DLC content again for now, but will definitely come back to do it later.

For the first one or two acts of Way of the Wise, I continued using the the Dual Blades, but I have since switched to the Odachi. I was able to use the same gear as a base, though I was not as tanky as before, and build on that. 

For the longest time I never really looked at the Odachi, because I thought it was all about switching stances mid-combo, to use many of the skills. Because of the horrible descriptions or translation I never realized that those stance changes happen automatically, as long as you press the correct button (e.g. press heavy attack during or after a light attack combo and you will switch into another stance), otherwise I would have probably tried it much earlier. Not that you really need to use those, since my preferred attacks are skills you use directly while guarding.

Because the Odachi is slower than the Katana or the Dual Blades, I have to think more about when to attack, continue with the combo or when to disengage. Because I know I can usually take a few hits, I am still too aggressive and take a lot of unnecessary damage.

For now I will keep using the Odachi, but I want to do an Iai Quickdraw build with a Katana and maybe try the Tonfas again. I am not really interested in the Axe, Spear or Kusarigama.

The increase in difficulty has also been kinda interesting. Apart from enemies just hitting harder (too hard, unless you build tanky), some of the changes are pretty good. At first it was just some additional enemies here and there, so the levels you already knew were just a tiny bit different. Then some got buffs (and are glowing red), so they are harder than normal (like mini-bosses). Next enemies got switched around. A demon you would normally only find in the DLC is suddenly in the early missions, or a normal human is replaced by a dog, who can alert others, etc. Finally a few (normally easy) enemies got a new move. That threw me for a loop at first, and maybe caused me to die one or two times. The AI was also changed a bit. Enemies use certain moves more often (Demons seem to like to throw you, if you stick close to them) and are a bit more aggressive. No idea if Way of the Nioh has some more changes in stock, but I look forward to it."
Games,fcimjp4,t1_fciho70,1577665066.0,"Totally. You need some basic skill and understanding to get through the first levels, after that you have probably leveled enough to get enough skill points to unlock at least one of those moves.
