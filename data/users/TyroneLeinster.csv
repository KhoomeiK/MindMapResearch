This was even more true in vanilla though. AV premades, for all their faults, put all serious alliance players on almost completely equal footing, and only horde doing organized between-queues wpvp had an advantage on that side (as they should).

Any decently organized guild has access to almost any pattern or recipe so selling them anything but raw mats is unlikely to be of interest to them. Having said that, they will want raw mats in bulk, and for cheap. This is generally the worst way to turn gathered mats into gold.

Things guilds and/or their top players would pay for are world buffs (dm clears, ony head drop), head/leg enchants (saves them the time of running around), running their alts through stuff like HoJ farming, and summons (not sure how you’d organize that in a worthwhile fashion)."
