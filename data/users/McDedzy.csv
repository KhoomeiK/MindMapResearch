politics,ff2pyf2,t1_ff2p058,1579518615.0,"I am Australian, and we certainly have significantly different gun laws here. I can buy a shotgun, a rifle, not a pistol.

What I can't do is walk around in public with a weapon. Open or concealed.

Edit: We can use most bolt action rifles, and any shotgun that is breach loaded."
