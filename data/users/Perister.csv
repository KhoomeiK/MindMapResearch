I don't care if it's resolution, HDR, refresh rate, frame smoothing, color accuracy, you name it. They will manipulate the image in god knows how many ways to deceive potential customers."
moviescirclejerk,ffkc0oy,t3_eu26y6,1580020296.0,I hope this doesn't awaken something in me...
AskReddit,ffj0r81,t1_ffimmcs,1579987485.0,And a pretty complex system to close up the cylinder gap when the trigger is pulled.
baseball,ffgu4sh,t1_ffgqtvb,1579915118.0,"Why would anyone talk about the 'skins for longer than contractually obligated?

It just sounds like masochism."
youdontsurf,ffgpnka,t3_etiraz,1579911878.0,She really likes scissoring I guess.
todayilearned,ffdslr1,t1_ffdsdnz,1579827883.0,Where in the world did you hear that?
todayilearned,ffdqko0,t1_ffd4ih7,1579826553.0,Northern Germanic languages had tremendous influence on the history of the English history but little of that is due to the Danelaw. There was extensive trading through the North Sea that brought a lot of Old Norse influence.
todayilearned,ffdq504,t1_ffd1wsq,1579826277.0,Middle English *is* a different language from modern English.
todayilearned,ffdpo6q,t1_ffcz2uw,1579825983.0,"People stopped using ""Thou"" completely during Middle English. It doesn't exist in any contemporary form of English."
todayilearned,ffdpfe8,t1_ffdjn05,1579825831.0,No but they come from the same Proto Indo-European root.
todayilearned,ffdod32,t1_ffdm53j,1579825164.0,"r/askhistorians FAQ discusses this IIRC.

I think r/history even has an automod response talking about issues with it."
todayilearned,ffdnnlc,t1_ffcw1ad,1579824734.0,"You do realize they targeted the picket ships because they negatively impacted the effectiveness of Japanese air attacks on American carriers using conventional and special attack unit (kamikazes), right?

Of course the counter to an American invasion  is attacking the transport ships but guess what, the special attack units were created to damage the American war effort materially. What the priority was changed as the war progressed but carriers were always near the top of the list.

You're trying *really* hard to be pedantic but you're doing a *terrible* job at it."
todayilearned,ffdmjl2,t1_ffcwn13,1579824062.0,No real point. Tokyo was mostly ash by 1945.
todayilearned,ffdmddw,t1_ffdksck,1579823955.0,Until the battle of Tsushima Japan was viewed as a petulant upstart and an oriental curiosity that could be exploited by real powers. It was in no way a superpower.
todayilearned,ffa0l8w,t1_ffa05m7,1579725460.0,"She wasn't convicted of espionage, IIRC she was basically charged with circumventing wartime censors. Anyone with a brain could tell what she was doing given the evidence they had but they couldn't actually prove that she was committing espionage beyond a shadow of a doubt."
todayilearned,ff7rnoi,t1_ff7g1s8,1579656703.0,"No, they weren't able to convict her on treason. The law they got her on was a max of ten years in jail + a $10,000 fine. She was given the max sentence."
todayilearned,ff58pqs,t1_ff57wvm,1579583571.0,I mean both of those worked though.
todayilearned,ff3yi6l,t1_ff3y1pe,1579551628.0,It's not the rate of production it literally takes that long to create fossil fuels. The vast majority of oil and natural gas comes from conditions that don't normally occur so we might not really see large quantities of oil and natural gas again. Coal production is much more common but we're already harvesting a lot of peat so we're already using (distant) future coal reserves.

todayilearned,ff1bf9n,t1_ff13e0r,1579477137.0,They did but the test wasn't done properly.
todayilearned,ff1b2ve,t1_ff0r21e,1579477000.0,Yes but apparently the book was freestanding so the energy was expended moving the book not penetrating it fully.

Now I'm sad."
MilitaryPorn,fezi3g3,t1_feyotdi,1579457603.0,Just finished the book yesterday. It was very good.
badlinguistics,fevdthi,t1_fetenev,1579396268.0,"That idea stems from a popular quote from Voltaire who said it near the end of the HRE's existence when it was in a very sorry state but it's kind of bullshit.

1. The HRE was created by the Church and the Emperor was always crowned by the Pope. 

2. The HRE was literally made to be a successor to the Roman Empire. The fact that the Roman Empire still existed became a major sticking point between Eastern and Western Christianity. Also it initially included Rome IIRC but in any case it contained plenty of what was at one point the Roman heartland .

3. It was ruled by an emperor who also held three kingdoms. The HRE incorporated areas that were majority Danish, Dutch, Wallonian, Occitan, German, Czech and other Slavs, Italian, French. Plus Japan has an Emperor and they're extremely homogeneous."
badlinguistics,feo7452,t1_fen9onf,1579295983.0,"Yeah I read that comment and I had no idea what he was trying to say.

I could try again but I don't think that would be worthwhile."

comedyhomicide,fe5bwr9,t3_ensxfb,1578867457.0,This isn't a homicide though.
HistoryMemes,fe505sh,t3_ens2jx,1578864453.0,Probably has something to do with pillaging Belgium and intentionally causing massive damage to France's industrial heartland.

awfuleverything,fdy3k8x,t1_fdxkw69,1578775701.0,Anchor Steam. Also very good.
awfuleverything,fdy3ddg,t1_fdxy3r9,1578775634.0,"Anchor will never stop making it as long as they are still brewing. They just aren't a large brewery so if you're outside the greater SF Bay Area it can be hard to find.

Their website can check if any is sold near you."

PropagandaPosters,fcuydnt,t1_fcuxco5,1577990991.0,"It's a common myth that the RAF was close to collapse when the Luftwaffe changed targets during the blitz. In reality the RAF had about a third of their strength still in training in Scotland plus a squadron or two in Northern Ireland. 

Plus even if the Germans somehow manage to land a significant force on English soil (spoiler: they couldn't) and against all odds somehow conquer the Island it's not like the rest of the Empire would submit."
todayilearned,fcuxhmf,t1_fcuvd6g,1577990497.0,"The biggest problem with that is that Voltaire never mentions it, and he hated the nobility which leads one to believe he had never heard of it"

Well yeah, nobody ever mentioned it until the 1800's when they talked about how batshit crazy nobles in the middle ages. It's basically a hoax."
AskMen,fctc5o5,t1_fct2var,1577938684.0,Has Steinman confirmed that?
HistoryMemes,fcny7m3,t1_fcnvna1,1577820745.0,The Soviets actually gained more land than they demanded before the war. The Soviets were never particularly interested in annexing Finland and it was never part of their plans for the winter war.
MapPorn,fcm29yr,t1_fclwvke,1577762358.0,The Romans genocided their related tribes and they were one of the few groups isolated enough to avoid assimilation.
HistoryMemes,fcda7yp,t1_fcd9uix,1577608158.0,"The church never made any official statement on evolution until it declared that it was not incompatible with Catholic teachings several decades after the publication of On the Origins of Species.
