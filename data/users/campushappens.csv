Entrepreneur,ff25ss7,t1_fezpxcj,1579494609.0,"Exactly my thoughts. In the first video, I was like I am not watching a 20-minute video so I sped it up to 2x but glad I watched it. He talks about some really great pointers."

YangForPresidentHQ,ff06r4j,t1_ff04ljx,1579465759.0,"Fine. No youtube, but I did mention other examples. What about those? We can literally trade stocks with 0% commission, start an online business to sell all over the globe, take online courses for free to gain new skills, tutor people in other countries using the internet, make music from other bedrooms and create hits, make mobile games (ie flappy bird), etc. There are a million new opportunities available to us that didn't exist in our parents' time. There is a catch though, to make/be something today requires some effort and skills but you know what doesn't, blaming boomers for our misery. haha"
YangForPresidentHQ,ff04caz,t1_fezwrko,1579465064.0,"I didn't tell YOU anything. This comment was based on some other comments from someone with a ""useless"" degree, working at a min-wage and living in a shitty place BUT blaming their parents for living a comfortable life.   
Yes, prices are going up; yes, you are spending more on shits but choosing to just sit back and complain and moan isn't a solution. It is OUR fault to not hustle, be creative and find new ways to make a living. Also, you can shove the 3 jobs story deep in your rare because only less than 5% US population holds 1+ jobs and it has been declining since the 90s (Source: US-bls).  
I didn't cherrypick the YT cases, I mentioned the ones in knew, I am sure there are countless examples to be inspired from. And that's exactly why I brought them up to show there are so many opportunities, and different ways to make it in today's times."
YangForPresidentHQ,fezp081,t3_eqwup7,1579459860.0,"This sounds similar to boomers bashing millennials with the infamous ""Back in my days"" saying. Blaming and pointing fingers go both ways but we are objectively better off than our parents in terms of the resources we have now.
Our parents didn't have the accessibility of the internet. Do you know how many YouTube ""stars"" and Internet ""celebrities"" have been created in the last decade who are rich af. The girl who raised an insane amount of money from selling nudes, some guy made 1 million from literally selling pixels on a Web page. This other kid made a killing from selling a paper with a bunch of logos on it. Youtube reviewers make a lot of money, crowdfunding has created major companies. We literally have endless possibilities to improve ourselves financially and otherwise but instead, we choose to blame it on our parents to take the blame from ourselves. Yes, boomers might have it good but remember boomer life was only great for a very specific demographic. Rest were just as fucked as we think we are.

I know so many people who used the Internet to teach themselves new skills and broke out of the shitty financial situation.

We can say boomer this and boomer that but in reality we have the resources and skills to change our lives but it's way easier to blame and point fingers."
GetMotivated,fefl09m,t3_eov2it,1579058566.0,That's why I sync my phone to my laptop. I never need to check my phone; because I am always on my laptop.
GetMotivated,fee8hel,t1_fe71tc2,1579028569.0,unrelated but is your name inspired by the HyperLoop project?
GetMotivated,fcsu2h1,t3_eiig5b,1577925117.0,It's not the measurements unit of improvement that people find difficult. It's determining the actions to take. Yes I would like to be 1% better tomorrow but what do it do today for it?
windsorontario,fcmkrby,t3_ehotoq,1577779356.0,"Pretty cool.

How did you come up with these routes and stops?"
politics,fcd249s,t3_egzlvv,1577605413.0,"It's sad how we get so focused and consumed on comparing A and B, republicans and dems, left and right that we completely ignore the severity of the situation. Imagine if someone robbed you because essentially that's what happens when politicians spend tax money especially in this case where profits from those golf trips are going to him.
