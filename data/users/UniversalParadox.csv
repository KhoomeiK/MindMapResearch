tippytaps,fdn3ljf,t1_fdm9nt0,1578576285.0,I'll definitely take a look at potentially getting a dog like that when I can! Appreciate all of the information you've given!

I actually take allergy pills everyday but I did recently start doing autoimmune therapy so hopefully in a few years, I'll be fine and I can cuddle all the doges I want!"
tippytaps,fdkrbnp,t3_elrkns,1578509531.0,It's stuff like this that makes me want to have a cute dog but then I remember that I'm allergic and would be miserable. Happy but miserable.

I didn't get Galatea but I believe she's around the same size as the rest of the ghost girls and they're just -slightly- too large to fit onto a card. :( Only one I could fit would be a ghost ogre, the rest are slightly too wide"
