Tuesday’s at Backstage Bar is good, and Monday’s at Songbirds is an open blues jam. I think Wanderlinger has music most nights. Honest Pint does Irish music on Sunday’s I believe.

Maybe frame it differently and see if that helps (instead of saying “let’s start a band” when none of you have ever played together before, try saying “want to jam sometime?” And see if the vibe is there.

Don’t get a mic for the banjo, it won’t be effective with a full band. You’ll want to get a pickup and a DI/preamp. The cheapest you’ll be able to go with this would be this setup:

And

Might be easier to explain to them that you can’t  afford to drop ~400 bucks or so to find out IF you want banjo in your band or not, wish her luck, ask if she wants to just jam sometime with you just for fun to show there are no hard feelings.
