AskMen,ff89di4,t3_erv3sy,1579669858.0,I have been raising monarch butterflies for 11 years. I got interested because I was interested in butterflues and saw the caterpillars being eaten in my garden. I raise the butterflies for education and to release with the kids at work. I gives lectures and workshops on pollinator gardening in my free time.
