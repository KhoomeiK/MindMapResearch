Feminism,feozyl7,t3_eq5ff3,1579309065.0,"Dude I don't think you looked hard enough. There are problems in literally every place I have worked.

So, my first job was at a factory. I had a friend, I would smoke weed with her or go to the bar with her after work sometimes. One day, after the company Christmas party I saw her yelling at my boss.

Later I asked her what was up an she told me that she slept with him after the Christmas party and that now he's stalking her. I asked her if she wanted to report him to HR and that I'd back her up if she did and she tells me she'll handle it and asked me to keep quiet. 

Well, a couple weeks later my car broke down and my friend offered to give me rides to and from work. My boss sees me getting in her car and he freaked out on me. He kept asking me if I was sleeping with her and being jealous over it. I told him repeatedly that I wasn't, we were just friends but he didn't believe me, I told him she just didn't want to see him again. I should have reported him to HR for harassing me, but it was my friends issue and she didn't want me to tell anyone.

Then about a week later she quit. I quit after that too, but my new job isn't any better. At my new job they won't even hire women, my new boss says something gross about ""not wanting to distract the guys"". Of course he's hated me from day one because I disagreed with him but he can't fire me."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feotl4b,t1_feoqhaj,1579305254.0,"The cost of living has gone up over the past 20 years, the Bureau of Labor statistics has found that the average cost to buy a house has gone up by %26 and the price of a new car has risen by %14 adjusted for inflation. At the same time wages have grown much slower. It's not the fault of 20 year olds, there is a real problem with the cost of living that needs to be fixed.

A person working a full time job at minimum wage can't afford the cost of living without help. They can't simply save money if they don't have money.

A universal income might not bring economic growth but it would help redistribute the wealth to give the most affected some relief from the rising cost of living. It would also help alleviate people who's jobs are lost due to automation.

I don't make personal jabs at you or call your ideas cliche, old or outdated."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feopg4h,t1_feomwce,1579303493.0,"Nice deflection but let's not make it personal. If more people have disposable income then more people will be spending money. Greater economic activity would benefit everyone.

Currently the only way for low income households to make it out of poverty without a mountain of debt is by playing the stock market. And half of all Americans don't know how to make money off of the stock market. This would help them leave poverty."
WhitePeopleTwitter,feommoi,t1_feom8dz,1579302251.0,"Why would the cost of everything go up? More people would be buying things once they aren't living paycheck to paycheck, companies would see higher profits and if we don't raise corporate taxes or sales tax it wouldn't make the price go up."

WhitePeopleTwitter,feojsod,t1_feojnyw,1579301120.0,Granting a universal income would encourage more people in poverty to start their own businesses. It would help them find opportunities.
WhitePeopleTwitter,feojj21,t1_feo5sw9,1579300962.0,"There shouldn't be a max limit, instead there should be a minimum. You can have as much money as you want, but you can't have less than $10,000 at any time or whatever a good amount would be. Or a universal income, a set amount of money the government pays you every month for being a citizen.

Maybe the lower limit would depend on the average cost of living in a area so you always have enough money to live comfortably. I'd be fine with just having $2000 every month, but I know if I lived in California I'd need like $5,000."

This was seen as a sweeping unnecessary nerf on all close and mid range weapons by the community on top of the already existing bfV hate bandwagon.

East Salem is very flat with flat farmland extending east to Silverton. South Salem is on top of a hill with many hills leading South and East towards the Cascades. West Salem, right across the river is nestled between the river and the Eola hills with many streets running up into the hills which run North West past Salem.

The Eola hills and South Salem hills stop the river from wandering so Salem has been a important place of agriculture for thousands of years by the Chemeketa Kalapuyan people, though you probably won't find any of that history in Salem today aside from a few street names and the name of the local community college."
