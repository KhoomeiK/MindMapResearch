The last years before Brexit and the Referendum the UK Government had a thing against the EU and blamed it for it’s inland problems even though that’s not correct, the advantages and the common interest protected by unity largely outweigh any negative money exchange that happened so that economically weaker countries could keep up with the Big 3 at the time Germany France UK. 

There were lies told, like that infamous NHS bus that tried to lure in elderly into voting to leave because that’s what every elderly person cares about: Their future health and monetary level. It wasn’t right to them to lie to those that hope they could improve their condition by it...

The Remain Campaign wasn’t successful because they were not ardent enough in counting all the benefits they got, rather then that they focused on the disadvantages of leaving. That was the mistake that Cameron should have considered, because if they position themselves as the “Doom sayer” and the Leave Party as the “Look we can do it!” Party, those not well informed will prefer the optimistic campaign which didn’t always stay truthfully.

Chameleos weakness is that it’s from hand and thus you might spy in your opponents cards but it could just show you 3 cards and be only those.

todayilearned,fejanj8,t1_feio14u,1579164404.0,"Problem js most people can’t resist telling others, I remember myself after finding a 2€ coin as a kid to be overly happy and telling a few people who then pretended it was their coin they dropped, even going so far as to call in a buddy of theirs to “prove” it was really theirs...

When people see an opening they will take it, and that’s why I now never trust anyone with stuff like that until it’s sure that the money is in my possession for good, like telling the next day and distorting the reality to say I found it in front of my house for example as I know when someone who never goes there is lying then.

Another classical example when you’re little would be that you see a coin and then you manage to pick it up before your brother even sees it and then, of course “he saw it first” and hits you so that you give him the coin. Problem only is I am 2 years older so that wasn’t going to happen but then shittily going to our mom and saying I took the coin he found, yeah... of cours the poor victim. And then my mother takes it away, wow very cool... 

As a kid 2€ is half a fortune in your eyes... But as a grown-up and smarter person in ruse and bluff, a lottery win can quickly go to a bunch of blood-sucking relatives who suddenly remember you owe them money or you promised that or that... yeah ok... 

The urge to tell ones luck is never a good idea in the immediate moment when the momentum of the win is still too high. Just as telling about the 2€ you found at school the day after, telling the lottery win a couple if month after is releasing enough momentum to keep bad people away, you can even lie on the sum and say it was 10% of what you actually got and that you spent it already entirely on something so that people think you are no longer worth trying to scam"

customhearthstone,fei4i7h,t1_fehy2fv,1579130098.0,"I didn’t say common cards were bad just that epics tend to have more unique/weird effects regardless of playability or are slightly stronger cards then others, an perfect example would be the Invoke support cards if you invoked twice as strong cards, Cube, Voidlord ect for stronger cards and maybe the 3/3 that switches top decks with you opponent, the demon which flips all stats, Voodoo doll as examples of more unique cards. The card here is kinda straight toward, isn’t tricky and not too hard to make use of, just a solid card one can run in Dragon/Heal decks so it feels more like a Rare one to me and we can agree that commons are usually very simple cards (be those good, very good or not so good cards) that are easy to understand so maybe it would be a bit too situational for Common. 

It’s just that for me, an Epic card should be just that: Epic. A card that is very interesting in concept, so unique or weird or a card that is strong (remember that a theoretically strong card can still see no play when it’s application is weak, in a no-weapon meta the 3/3 ooze from Ungoro, even if very good will never be played) Rare to me is for medium cards, a bit complicated but not much, just like this one, it requires you to tech your deck with Heal to make have it at full potential. And common is for straight forward and simple cards that need not much build around and are either very solid like the ones you mentioned or OK cards. For Class Legendaries, they should either complement or make a deck, Shudderwock is a good example of both, it’s as much a deck defining card as a very good support to all Battlecry decks. Another one would be Toggwaggle as Lackey support or Rafam as a deck defining card for Quest builds."
