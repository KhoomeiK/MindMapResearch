Hmm, if you're really starting out pa lang sa 2 wheels, baka lang maging overwhelming in the beginning. I've been on a bike since I was 3 and medyo matapang ako. Dami ko nang semplang! Even wiped out on gravel just before I did BTW, kasi hindi ko na-calculate ng maayos yung brakes and speed ko (it was on a slightly busy road near MOA and there was a lot of construction). Would advise na mag-practice ka ng biking somewhere safe to get a feel of how you'd move in your space without cars, buses, or motorcycles restricting your movement. I'd been doing BTW regularly for 2 months before ko pinilit yung sarili ko na mag-merge with traffic. Sobrang takot ko pero I was counterflowing para lang makaiwas sa merging. It took me a couple of tries on a weekend before I could merge properly with the jeeps, cars, and buses in my area.

phmoneysaving,fcwkbtc,t3_ej9zv3,1578027983.0,"There are some BTW (bike-to-work) groups on FB that you can join, with plenty of female riders.

Some days I'd ride out from the office at 9 or 10 pm, especially if it had been raining, since my folding bike couldn't take the flooding too well.

Won't sugarcoat it -- even though I was fairly lucky and didn't get into any major accidents considering my route (Roxas Blvd-Buendia), bike-riding can get dangerous. Truck drivers and bus drivers won't see you if you ride at the very back, and some drivers will cram you in, leaving you little to no room to maneuver. Then there's all the bumpy roads with potholes, and the motorcyclists na mahilig sumingit. My mother thanked her lucky stars when I decided to stop.

The upside is that it was very freeing to me, that I didn't need a car to get around. On weekends I'd ride around Luneta Park and Roxas Boulevard, just enjoying the wide and relatively traffic-less roads. It's seeing the city from a completely different perspective. Loved the wind on my face and the sun beating down. I'd even make doctor's appointments in BGC and ride from my Makati office via McKinley. Timed myself once and made it in 27 minutes. Plus, riding from BGC-McKinley back to EDSA-Ayala was one of the things I loved doing, since it was all downhill. Sarap! My office was great about BTW -- I could park my foldie in one corner of our reception area and take a shower in the bathroom.

If you're thinking about expenses, there is an initial outlay at the beginning for your bike, then you have to get a helmet, riding gear (dry fit shirts + running shorts/leggings + old running shoes did the trick for me), an all-weather backpack to store your laptop/work stuff and clothes, lights for the rear and front of your bike, a bike kit for fixing flat tires, etc. Bike maintenance every 6 to 8 weeks, more if it's during the rainy season.

I mapped out a route a few weeks before I did my first BTW, during Sunday, so I could get familiar with it before starting out. That can help calm your fears a bit, if you're a little bit hesitant.
