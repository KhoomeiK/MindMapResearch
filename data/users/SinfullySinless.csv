More parents teach girls to “value their hymen’s/virginity” while only telling boys “don’t get her pregnant”. There are significantly different values being taught to boys and girls regarding sex. 

Personally, as a girl, I was just taught “don’t get pregnant” and for me that helped me separate sex and emotional feelings. My ex-boyfriend grew up in a strict Catholic household and was taught that sex and emotional intimacy was the same thing and he couldn’t separate it.
