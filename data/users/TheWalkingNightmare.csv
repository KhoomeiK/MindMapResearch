No chance of any compromise. If I think I deserve a 9 or a 10, I do deserve a 9 or a 10. I'll wait because I'm not that needy for a relationship. I've got an interesting life that will keep me up until it's time."

gainit,fgmoca4,t1_fgmo5wn,1580928699.0,"Doing this obviates the bad taste/texture of the oats too. It's like drinking thick milk. Also, the apparent volume is greatly reduced. A big bowl of oats reduces to a mere cup."

Rest of the months are very easy, provided you do not look at porn or think of fucking those instagram thots that randomly appear on your feed. I have been on a 8 month streak, by the way.

AskMen,fgjggf7,t1_fgjfvhb,1580843530.0,Wow. My maternal aunt was incredibly beautiful in her youth. She married someone who would be considered very average/below average in terms of looks(had already started balding then). And these were her words when asked what was it that she saw in her husband: he is a fabulously nice human being(though differently phrased).
