apexlegends,ffdto5m,t3_eswt0n,1579828656.0,He looks so dope.
destiny2,ffd8l95,t1_ffbxej8,1579815538.0,His helmet. I used the wrong word. It's only dropped randomly from heroic public events on Mercury of which there is only one event and it can easily fall apart if someone kicks the next phase of the event off before you make it up to the second level. Which has happened a lot to me. I make it part way and the floor dissolves beneath me.
StarWarsLeaks,ffd8bd9,t1_ffcunga,1579815379.0,So it's the body guard doubling her in Phantom Menace right? That's why it looks like Padme but older.
destiny2,ffczb6t,t1_ffcdfsh,1579810349.0,I do it for Shaxx. His encouraging words mean more to me than winning or losing.
destiny2,ffcz6r6,t3_esrckx,1579810280.0,This actually made me sad. Way too real.

Great...more hypocrites. Just what the galaxy needed."
YangForPresidentHQ,ff7r56r,t1_ff7hznq,1579656344.0,But he didn't win this time and with his followers are telling us to sacrifice for their victory. Even if he wasn't clearly future proofing America like nobody else is it's rude to demand others give up so you might win. It's selfish.
mildlyinteresting,ff7n9e2,t3_es2d9y,1579653615.0,I know some inmates that would like to hire you dog. Hell there's businesses installing tornado shelters that would happily contract your dog.

LegendsOfTomorrow,ff6fr4b,t3_erqg4p,1579626228.0,If Brandon really gets that limited Superman run on HBO I'll be more at peace with it. He deserves to be recognized at large for how great he is.
cyberpunkgame,ff6diwr,t3_erjz9n,1579624842.0,Damn I shoulda bought in. The game launch is gonna do wonders for the company.
