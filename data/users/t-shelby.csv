bulletjournal,ff99v2h,t3_esdpto,1579708152.0,"I had this issue last year. I would try the whole yearly tracker of something and I just found it really overwhelming. 

If you want to do this though, you might find it easier to keep notes on your phone of each day? So just write a quick note of the date and then whatever you were feeling for the day. That way, you can fill in the boxes in one go whenever you get around to it, rather than feeling like you have to do it at the end of every day before you forget. Hope this helps in some way! :)"

bulletjournal,ff77kfb,t3_es0qlq,1579642679.0,"February playlist? You can fill out what songs you listened to the most at the end of the month. Like this: https://weheartit.com/entry/334718441

Or you could leave it as a reflections/journal entries page, where you can just write down things relating to anything important that happened in February."
