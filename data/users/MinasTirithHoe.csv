TooAfraidToAsk,ffpb209,t1_ffpapyj,1580090605.0,"Im not sure exactly what you are asking, but that is why i said j walk. The person in this scenario went from sidewalk to street suddenly. But i do believe people will always use side walks. I just also believe eventually there will be a much better system for walking to places that down involve putting yourself in the path of a car. But idek if that will happen in our lifetimes"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffpakhb,t1_ffp9z9a,1580090263.0,"Not in every case, say your self driving car is going down a street and someone suddenly j walks directly infront of your car. Lets so that in this specific scenario the only option for your car is A) hit the person or B) make a sharp turn directly into a poll while going 80km an hour. I can see how in the grand scheme things this would worry a lot of people. But eventually self driving cars are going to be the more common way of getting around. Humans get tired, distracted, listen to music, drive one handed, reach for their coffee, etc any of these actions can result in an accident that almost always could have been avoided. A self driving car is equipped to avoid ALL of these accidents, its purpose it to drive safely, cautiously, and have much more awareness of their surroundings than humans do on their own. At the end of the day, in the future the roads will be a much much safer place."

offmychest,ffjt51w,t1_ffjsd6y,1580006239.0,"Wow, you really really remind me of myself. I would look into seeing a therapist. I wish i started to 3 years ago, but i put it off because deep down i wanted myself to reach the point of suicide.  Being alone was always the worst for me, and even more so, silence. I would go on my phone, and next thing i knew im lost in a day dream of melancholy thinking. Like i said its tricky business. Mental illness is like an addiction. Its easy to be addicted to the state of mind you are in, ESPECIALLY if it is an unhealthy state. You my friend are on your way down a very slippery slope. And i say all this with confidence because of how much you sound exactly like me when i would journal my suicidal or “dull” thoughts. Look up dissociation, it seems like that is the state you are in. Also to add if you need a friend I am willing to be there for you when you are alone and slipping into that state. I play a lot of minecraft, idk if you do to but if that’s something you are into we can play on a world together and it can help pull you out of reality for a bit. And escape that trapped feeling of being alone :) Let me know, im here :)"
unpopularopinion,ffjse7r,t1_ffjr5sr,1580005666.0,"I would happily say that to your face. Anger gets people to the place of more anger. Love gets us to where people want to be. You’re probably so angry because a lot of what i said was accurate. And you’re probably too caught up in bullshit to actually be happy. Instead you mistake happiness with the adrenaline of being petty. But at the end of the day you just have an angry in pain heart. And i hope one day you can open your heart to all people, with differing opinions and lifestyles. Instead of closing yourself off to feeling that peace and sense of one with the world. You want to feel in control i get it. Its human nature, let go of that and be happy man."
offmychest,ffjrvyl,t3_eu0jau,1580005277.0,"This os a lot of how i explained my mind before I accepted the fact that i had depression. I would always be saying “im not sad i just dong think life is for me” and so on and so on. Having a will for life (some will disagree with me) is a choice. We control our thoughts, our thoughts turn into regular streams of thought, and those can turn into action or belief. The mind is a tricky thing. After accepting i had depression and choosing to control my life instead of sitting in the seat of “oh one day ill probably just off myself” I actually started to enjoy my life again. I wasnt sad, i enjoyed things still. But i would be sitting there with friends and boom a thought of slitting my wrists would just pop in. And i would welcome that thought. And slowly it grew stronger and stronger. That was a few years ago. Choosing to indulge and day dream about death is tricky business. It still happens to me sometimes but i can tell the difference between my “depressed” self and my true self. My advice is to explore your identity a bit more, figure out what is missing in your life, or what you need to cut out. Happiness is indeed a choice, but also a state of mind. I chose to go the path of happiness, instead of thinking about hanging myself every time i felt uninterested, bored, dull, or any mundane or sad feeling. When shit hits the fan in your life you will feel a lot worse, and those feelings will fill you with rage and an impulsive feeling of wanting to act on it. Is it fair to your true self? Absolutely not. You just have to define that line between what is you, and what is the depression/chemical part of your brain controlling your impulses."
Showerthoughts,ffjqznk,t3_eu0hbq,1580004680.0,"Well changing a baby’s diaper and wiper a soggy shitty ass is one thing. Seeing your 16 yr olds penis or vagina is just violating their privacy. Kids are raised that their private parts are just that, private. The child doesn’t remember their parent wiping their ass for 2-3 years. They remember the lessons they learned as they developed their own sense of privacy and boundaries. For parents to expect them to be blindly comfortable just because “oh i saw it all when you were a baby” is just disrespectful to that child and the so called boundaries the parents instilled in them."
unpopularopinion,ffjqhxb,t3_eu0cap,1580004352.0,"Take a moment, and i mean please really take a moment and take a step back from the hussle and bussle of the busy world and stop caring about other peoples problems. Pro life? Prob choice? Who fucking cares, make that stance when you vote. In the mean time develop your own identity instead of relying on a bunch of shit that doesnt affect you but makes you feel like a “protector of unborn children”. You are literally doing absolutely no benefit to anyone by obsessing over mass issues. The only power you have? Vote. Sharing stuff on facebook, twitter, reddit, just makes you a waste of space who cant find a hobby or something positive to do. Instead you obsess over the negative in the world. Go outside, take a walk, feed the birds. Slow the fuck down, do yourself a favour. You are not the mesiah of fetuses."
AmItheAsshole,ffjpehb,t3_eu07oa,1580003626.0,"Nta, relationships have a lot of requirements for them to work, but the most important aspects are love, but almost more so, compatibility. You feel like a baby sitter because that’s essentially what you are. Loving, caring, and wanting someone to be happy isnt a reason to stay in a relationship with someone. The reason you stay is because the life you have together (right here in the present moment) is the life you want. Not the future life, not when he makes some progress, fantasies cant count. I loved my ex boyfriend dearly, but at the end of the day we werent compatible. We were best friends but we didnt work out because i couldnt live my life happily being with him. And thats whats important. In a relationship you want to both be happy with yourself, independent, loving, understanding, and whatever else is important for you in relationships. Then you come together and share your life and happiness together. An unhealthy relationship is relying on it for ones main source of happiness and peace. Happiness is something you share together, not something you are required to provide for your significant other."

relationship_advice,ffagfw0,t3_esjxcu,1579735163.0,"Get a piece of paper for both of you. Write down a list of 5 things that the other does already that turns you on, or that you really like in bed. Then after that write down another five things that are fantasies or fetishes, or something that you want to try. Even something as simple as new positions or like spanking or something. Saying things out loud is hard, and being the only one to give ideas is hard too. This way you both will have a clear understanding of what to do more of and what to try out. Or come up with something similar to this, but I highly suggest writing it down and coming up with new things. People are scared of rejection or hurting someone, this is a positive way of shining the light on what you already enjoy (even if you both already know) while also addressing new things without the fear of hurting the other. Also to add, this is more personal to me but I know a lot of women have an issue with “feeling like a tool for masturbation” maybe make a habit of occasionally just getting her off. Or to try to get her to masturbate infront of you, and then take over, maybe use a toy. Fully focus on her and how shes reacting and feeling. And dont ask things like “was that good?” Because (depending on the girl) she will just say yes everytime. Instead ask things like “should i go faster or slower next time” “did you like xy or z better” etc. Avoid yes or no answer when your addressing the quality or enjoyment of certain things"

AskReddit,ffa24kr,t3_eshx5y,1579726359.0,"Depends on what they say. If you can relate explain that you get how they feel without telling your whole story because that takes away from their pain. If you cannot relate be honest, say “i cant imagine how painful that must be”. Or if the person is going through a rough time i wouldnt say “im always here” or “you can call or text me whenever you need”. Those are generic responses and they probably wont reach out. Instead take the time to call them one day and ask how theyre doing. Or text them and say “hey im in your neighborhood want me to bring you a coffee”. Acts of kindness go WAY further than saying you’re there for someone. But if its just in a conversation just try to empathize with how they feel, dont assume how they feel just imagine how it would feel to be them, theres not much to say, but it helps knowing that you are listening and not writing off their emotions."

No matter what the people around me said or what support I got, I couldnt get better until i truly chose that i wanted my will of life back. The only person who can make you get better is yourself, you have to have people you can rely on. But relying TOO much wont do any good. A big part of it is watching my thoughts, instead of thinking “fuck im so depressed i want to die” I have to think “im experiencing bad depression today”. Wanting to die isn’t a trait, its symptom of a disease that takes over your brain. Realizing the difference between self and depressed self are the hardest parts for me.

Dont take the cons list personal, just look at it as a test for compatibility. Honestly i think a lot more couples should do this, it really breaks down how you see someone, and what you value in the relationship. Try researching love languages too, it might be helpful if you both figure out exactly what your love language is, it can help avoid unnecessary conflict in relationships and strengthen understanding in one another."

Divorce this free loader, he is so clearly taking you for granted. Dont make excuses for him, and dont hold on to a potential future that “may” change, I say may because it probably wont change. Listen to your gut, its speaking to you pretty loudly."

CasualConversation,fcuomll,t1_fcunm8j,1577985409.0,"As someone who had a very similar experience as OP, its not necessarily making a big deal about “coming out”. Its normally a very casual conversation, but she was just talking about her current life and the changes shes going through (the break up, exploring this other side of her, etc). Its just like any major changes in life, generally people talk about these changes with people their close to. When you have a million thoughts going on in your mind its nice to vent and open up to friends. She probably felt like she couldnt talk about her attraction to girls before because she was suppressing it, and now she can say things like “omg i find this girl so cute”. Some people feel a need to say “hey btw i like girls” and some people are open about it but dont ever “come out” because it was already obvious. She wasnt open about it before, hence the need for opening that area of her life to friends. I hope this helped spread some understanding :)"
