ABoringDystopia,fel96xt,t3_epotcb,1579216799.0,"Makes me think about that QAnon candidate that was planning to run against Ilhan Omar. She was arrested for stealing a cart full of stuff from Target and fined like $5000. An insane amount of money that could financially cripple any normal American.

Meanwhile, a company can knowingly fuck over an entire community, through wage theft, closing a plant to make the bottom line look better, or literally poisoning a water source, and receive nothing more than a slap on the wrist. 

It’s insane how much big companies and rich people can get away with in this country."

depression,fdc7hu0,t3_ekf9j7,1578268613.0,"First, go to a hospital or ER, tell them that you are suicidal and need help. They should have a doctor or nurse that can help you.

Secondly, it’s possible that she became overwhelmed with how much you rely on her. She may have been ok with it until your fight because she didn’t realize it, or she may have had second thoughts. She just a person and people can only handle so much before they break.

It sucks that she ghosted you, and that is super shitty, but you need to start getting used to not obsessively talking to her. I literally just started dealing with it myself again after a relapse, so I know the feeling. It’s fucking hard and anxiety-inducing, but you’ll be better if for it. Give yourself breaks from your phone, whether that means leaving it in a different room or leaving it on the charger and going for a walk."

depression,fdbtany,t3_ekew3u,1578261681.0,"I can only speak on meds, but here’s what I’ve got:

There’s a lot of fear around pills because of the 80s and 90s, and everyone knows someone (or knows someone who knows someone) who had a bad experience with antidepressants, but a proper medication will help.  It might take a few tries to get the proper mix of drug and dosage, and some of those tries might be harder than others, but eventually you find the right one. 

If the existence of potential side-effects scare you, just remember that every medicine (even aspirin), has potential side-effects. They have to put those on the label if there is even the smallest chance of it happening.

If she ends up going with meds, she needs to be open, honest, and detailed with her doctor if something is wrong.  When I go on new meds or increase my dose, I keep a journal on my phone calendar so I can track any changes, making note of the time and the experience. This makes communicating with my doctor so much easier because I don’t need to try to remember what’s happened over the past 2 weeks.

Examples: 1:45 pm, just started panicking for no reason. 8 PM, I’m tired when I’m normally not."

depression,fd3b48k,t3_ejw74l,1578156490.0,"Please don’t take this as condescending because I see so much of myself in this post, but oh, to be 19 again.

I know it feels like your life is over and your best years are behind you, but you have an entire lifetime of opportunity ahead of you. I know you live paycheck to paycheck and that is anxiety inducing, but you are in the perfect position to take chances and find out who you really are. You’re still forming as a person and, if you don’t get stuck in the spiral of despair, in 3 years you’ll look back and see a completely different person. 

As a 27 year old who wasted his teens and 20s and hopes to make the best out of the next 2 1/2 years, my best advice is: drink water and stay hydrated, practice good dental care (depression destroyed my teeth), find hobbies away from social media and have nothing to do with your job, know what your time is worth so employers don’t take advantage of you to the point that you have no life outside of work, get used to failure and let it inspire you to try harder instead of giving up right away, and most importantly, find a therapist you feel comfortable with. If you can’t afford one, see if any local colleges or professionals offer services for low-income patients. Oh, and pay off your credit card each month and don’t go too crazy with purchases. That interest racks up fast.

What you’re going through right now is completely normal. I was depressed at 19, refused to get help for about 6 years and almost walked into traffic because of it, and had no direction in life past college. Don’t do what I and so many others did and be miserable for most of your 20s. You’re in the perfect position to get help and turn everything around, especially because you’ve already taken the hardest step and openly acknowledged that something isn’t right."

2meirl4meirl,fd20879,t1_fd1ulgm,1578139613.0,"Counter point, there is nothing heroic in toughing it out instead of getting help, you’re just making life miserable for yourself and everyone around you.  People who do this just self-medicate in other ways, like excessive alcohol consumption, and are probably the reason why suicide is on the rise in the US. 

A proper medication and dosage won’t dampen your creativity, it’ll just help your body work correctly. It’s like glasses.

Meds isn’t right for everyone. Some need therapy. Some need a lifestyle change. It depends on the person and the situation. But this naive and foolish opinion that proper medication will damage you is going to continue getting people killed."
