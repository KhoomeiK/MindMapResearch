Narcolepsy,ff690nc,t3_ervn3h,1579621966.0,Contact Jazz hotline. They can give detailed review of which to steer clear from
dyscalculia,ff68wr4,t1_ff66l23,1579621895.0,Does your university have disability services? They should be able to assist in a diagnosis
ADHD,ff4eqsc,t1_ff3byxa,1579561861.0,Good for you!
socialanxiety,ff4cd22,t3_erh615,1579560284.0,"I’m willing to help out anyone here with some big fat lies. If someone here needs a reference and can adequately write out what they want me to say, send me a PM."
Narcolepsy,ff3mjqp,t1_ff3kcn6,1579544243.0,"Ask your doctor if you met the diagnostic criteria for IH. Ask for explicit answers about sleep latency. You may have landed on a diagnosis but your doc failed to explain- that’s not uncommon, unfortunately. You wouldn’t be prescribed modafinil for no reason."
Narcolepsy,ff3hrwx,t1_ff3hfie,1579541320.0,"Also plenty of drugs have far too much hysteria attached without recognizing the legitimate uses. Alcohol causes death, destruction, moral decay, etc but is perfectly legal and we accept its faults while maintaining it should stay legal. Alcohol is the number one date rape drug yet GHB is illegal outside of Xyrem use. Don’t attach morality to the legal standing of drugs."
Narcolepsy,ff3hj6x,t3_era83e,1579541163.0,"So were you diagnosed with and explained to about IH? If so, don’t feel weird about benefitting from modafinil. Just because a medication isn’t specifically approved for a condition doesn’t mean it does help. Modafinil doesn’t help the root cause of N either, just masks the EDS."
Narcolepsy,ff3hb9n,t1_ff1lfzv,1579541026.0,"I only see this post as asking for personal anecdotes, though, so no different than the usual “has anyone switched from moda to adderall” and so forth we get daily."
Narcolepsy,ff3h4gn,t1_ff211fw,1579540910.0,"There’s plenty of “illegal drugs” that have perfectly acceptable, legitimate medical uses. Lots were legal, medical drugs prior to becoming illegal."
Narcolepsy,ff3gxij,t1_ff38wlf,1579540798.0,Don’t continue with any doctors who accuse you of making up symptoms.
Narcolepsy,ff0ip5d,t3_er2419,1579469207.0,Contact Jazz Pharm hotline
idiopathichypersomnia,fettm95,t1_feprw5y,1579379929.0,How did you get diagnosed with DSPD?
Narcolepsy,fesijsc,t1_fepts98,1579365567.0,"Contact their hotline to discuss specifics about lifestyle changes, side effects, doses, etc. The hotline can also provide you with some information on how Xyrem works to help you as someone with narcolepsy. Basically it regulates your sleep cycle, reducing fragmented sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and cataplexy."
idiopathichypersomnia,feplyyh,t1_feo37md,1579324009.0,How were you diagnosed with both IH and DSPD? Were they diagnosed separately?
Narcolepsy,fepky04,t3_epqwn1,1579323215.0,Consider a different med possibly if it’s not working well
Narcolepsy,fepkws3,t1_fenm5gt,1579323188.0,Stay hydrated and remember to eat regularly on adderall. Don’t be afraid to try meds that can help you!
Narcolepsy,fepkrmx,t3_eq0isx,1579323074.0,"Headaches are a common side effect. I unfortunately get them. Works great for lots of people though, really well for a lot of people. Good luck on it!"
Narcolepsy,fepkp33,t3_eq1hic,1579323018.0,You can always contact Jazz to discuss your questions. Use them as a resource! Sometimes docs don’t educate enough.
Narcolepsy,fepkkg6,t1_fephq3h,1579322921.0,I also had genetic testing mostly covered with a $3500 deductible.
Narcolepsy,fepjhaa,t3_eqb4cn,1579322091.0,I was not.
Narcolepsy,fekujox,t3_eplpxs,1579207890.0,"Anxiety, depression, and Dysphoria are common aide effects of Xyrem. Contact your sleep doc to discuss adjusting the dose or adding maintenance meds in to ease the side effects (if it’s working for you otherwise). Make sure you are religiously following the lifestyle adjustments required for Xyrem as this eases side effects. Invest in a blood pressure cuff to monitor your bp daily. Keep a journal to detail every day how you feel upon wakening and how you feel throughout the day to measure patterns and changes. Also if you’re not already in counseling I highly recommend it as it can help you immensely in adjusting to life with side effects, acclimating to meds, life with chronic illness, etc. Most importantly though is to contact Jazz’s support line and/or to it sleep doc with any questions or changes in mood and/or behavior."
socialanxiety,feh9kxo,t3_ep0yle,1579111990.0,Oh yes
ADHD,feg5c17,t3_eozb8y,1579077638.0,I get lost more than anyone I know!
Anxiety,feg0nbb,t3_eoxhbw,1579071901.0,I totally get it! If it doesn’t help don’t force it. It’s not always that helpful for me either. You’re not alone.
ADHD,feg0jci,t3_eow75q,1579071774.0,"I’m sorry but the title made me laugh because I’ve thought the same so many times. Maybe it’s not the right meds or the right dose. You’re not stupid, but we’re hard on ourselves. Remember to extend some kindness to yourself! ADHD is so challenging to live with."
Narcolepsy,feg00nt,t3_eoxpzp,1579071183.0,"Can you find a new sleep specialist? With such a severe case of cataplexy you should definitely see someone comfortable with N. SSRIs/SNRIs would be appropriate for suppressing cataplexy if you don’t want to try Xyrem, but you should have a doctor who isn’t against Xyrem all together."
antiwork,feff8i6,t1_fefe61s,1579055067.0,Exactly. Why should someone else get my best 8 hours of the day?
socialanxiety,feff0i9,t3_eotz6i,1579054931.0,Lmao yup
ADHD,fef7xz7,t3_eooi74,1579050308.0,One of my coping skills is avoiding everyone and everything so they don’t find out how much of a disaster I am. I lie about how hard I’m struggling due to years of undiagnosed ADHD and thinking I’m broken. I’m trying to be more open about when I need help but it is really challenging.
idiopathichypersomnia,fef6sa6,t3_eor987,1579049526.0,Consider chronic fatigue syndrome as well. You said exercise makes it worse which is a huge part of CFS. Check out that sub as well as r/narcolepsy to get a feel of how your symptoms match up.
Narcolepsy,fccfps0,t1_fccasgy,1577597865.0,You get it from Jazz’s pharmacy. They deliver it to you.
Narcolepsy,fbycw62,t3_ef51fv,1577213736.0,It’s infuriating how expensive narcolepsy medications are.
