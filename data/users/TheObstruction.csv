combinations and associations under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct, control,

this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. 
They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial 
and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the 
delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a 
small but artful and enterprising minority of the 
community; and, according to the alternate triumphs 
of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous 
projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common 
councils and modified by mutual interests. However 
combinations or associations of the above descripion may now and then answer popular ends, they 
are likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, 
and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the 
power of the people and to usurp for themselves the 
reins of government, destroying afterwards the very 
engines which have lifted them to unjust Dominion.
