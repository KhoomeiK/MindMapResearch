Cello,ffefhkz,t3_esupn4,1579846016.0,"Hi all - does anyone know if there's a way to reply here so that everyone interested can see or receive a top level post, rather than write back to each person individually with this detail?  
  
Update on my wife's cello: It's a basic inexpensive preowned, ""Euro"" brand student level one! The folks knew someone who had it and picked it up for very little money. This was the case bc my wife's focus was on almost solely on voice, her skills were already developed in piano, and for fun she played guitar and flute... the cello came far after the others, but she did grow to love it and apparently became quite talented. Due to this, even a decent quality student 4/4 size would likely be a significant upgrade, so maybe we are back in the $1000 or maybe even less range. How much for a bow? Anything else to budget for? I'm so relieved after reading about the $10k to 50k good ones she might've needed.  
  
Okay, now shall I PM or reply to each post below/above or does anyone know any tricks? Thank you everyone!"

Cello,ffdiwi1,t1_ffd7q0g,1579821823.0,"Great question with I think a really interesting answer! She comes from a family of musically talented  MDs and other professors.    
   
She went fully into music and voice and as she learned more and more about the biomechanics of the vocal instrument, she decided to study it further through speech therapy and pathology, which she got her master's in.  She reveled in working with children and helping them speak.    
   
From there it came naturally to continue her clinical research and study more and more anatomy, effectually ending up getting her PhD in anatomy and biology and teaching at the same medical school where her parents met. :)    
  
Her folks were just honored for  practicing 50 years each, if you can believe that. And they still practice.   
  
That's just the tip of the iceberg of this amazing woman and her unbelievable family. I just submitted the story of how we met to Modern Love.

Cello,ffcnihe,t1_ffchr6z,1579803221.0,"Absolutely understood - she's from a family of doctors who all play music and multiple instruments so you may we right... it could be an extremely expensive instrument. As noted above to another poster, perhaps since her degree was in voice, maybe hers was ""just"" a student level cello, will know more today at some point. And it might be cheaper to fly down, visit the fam, and bring it back, though her dad liked the idea of leaving that one there. They miss her terribly, so maybe it would just hurt to see her instrument not in her old room..."
Cello,ffcn8k1,t1_ffcfoxb,1579803050.0,"I hear you. Then again I picked up a nice used Cordoba classical guitar for me/us for about $400 when she moved to the US, since she never played a steel string--it was maybe $1000 new, certainly not a high-level Martin, etc, and she was loved with playing around with that, so we'll see. I posted a longer note above, and will keep you all posted and I really appreciate everyone's input - thank you!"
Cello,ffcmymw,t1_ffcb4by,1579802881.0,"Thanks for the great detailed response.  
Yes, the idea was it would be a surprise gift (unless my wife checks on my reddit posts, which is possible, she's a highly intelligent researcher... Sweetie, are you there?).   
I'm afraid if she knew the plan she's shoot it down as too extravagant or for any number of other reasons. She's an incredibly modest, lovely woman  but doesn't receive pricey gifts well. Her father has offered to go in on it with me and he suggested leaving that one in Brazil. Maybe if we find the cost is cheaper to fly down and bring hers back, even with an extra ticket--and we'd get to visit, he'll change his mind... and she'd find it easier to accept.  
We'll see soon. Since her degree was in vocal performance, maybe it's ""only"" a student level cello! (Oh please, oh please.) That would make it much simpler. Keep you posted!"

After talking to hundreds of people a day, many of them regulars, sometimes talking to some for seconds, others all day, I can honestly say that some people I found boring as shit that I may have much in common with, and others fascinating who I have nothing in common with.   
  
There are so many factors and combinations of factors. It could be passion or humor-- but then some people without those attributes might be fascinating if they are brilliant or can find a way to make a normally boring subject interesting, like a good teacher or professor.   
  
Others may be great storytellers (and thus very interesting)... but about something you may not be interested in like sports or rap, or parenting.

The dragonflies would land all over you and pick off the bugs, or fly around your head and catch one and land back on your shoulder.

Screenwriting,fe3xoal,t1_fe3vlcf,1578853819.0,That's the plan - hopping back on the project later today.
Screenwriting,fe3ujca,t1_fe3q5xc,1578853032.0,I appreciate those details - I wasn't in love with MM at first use last night.
Screenwriting,fe3uev5,t1_fe3qzzp,1578852993.0,"Thanks a lot for those insights. I'll see if I'm comfortable with Fade In, at least for now, for some of those reasons."
Screenwriting,fe3lpeu,t1_fe3jrhm,1578850448.0,"Great, thanks. I dl'd a trial of Movie Magic last night and felt a little lost, since it's been a long time since using scriptwriting programs. Maybe I'll try WriterDuet and Fade In to see if I can make a quicker start."
blackmagicfuckery,fe3jid0,t1_fe3ei9w,1578849795.0,"Can't say, but my friend pleaded with my gf and I not to take his bro in--which is exactly what we wanted to do, being young, hopeful, philanthropic, and incredibly naive. Someone else did, helped get him clean, then he burned down part of their house with a crack ho he invited over during a relapse. One of many."
itookapicture,fe3ebe2,t1_fe2h5c8,1578848489.0,"Great shot. And you just helped nail down a look I've been describing for a character in a TV show pitch, so thanks for that!"
blackmagicfuckery,fe3dak1,t1_fe31l71,1578848266.0,"It's a tragedy, how many really talented people are on the streets, homeless,  or hustling in some desperate way due to mental illness or drugs.   
I was once in a car with a well known actor driving through the sea of homeless people in downtown L.A., they were like the walking dead, and he suddenly pointed across the street and said ""oh, there's my brother. ""  
Had all the options in the world, but crack took him down time and again."

brasil,fe3agxd,t1_fe0gssf,1578847504.0,Definitely. Would like to see if I can find a band that wants to help. I'm sure many band members were their patients and would live to help if I could figure out how to get the word out. Maybe craigslist?
Screenwriting,fe39lz0,t1_fe1w0gi,1578847212.0,None that you would say are more user friendly or intuitive then?
unstirredpaint,fe06h8b,t1_fdwca99,1578804279.0,Similar but different question: what are all the badge looking things on her clip?
Screenwriting,fe03qrg,t1_fe02sd5,1578802320.0,"I'll check it out - thanks!  
Edit: looks like someone doesn't like this program--downvoting every comment rather than providing constructive feedback. Reddit is a weird place sometimes."
Screenwriting,fe03q2k,t1_fe01xmu,1578802305.0,"Sure, buying it is fine - it'd be nice if I could keep whatever I start with, but if I need to jump up to FD or MM later that's okay too... it's just about speed and ease right now... would you say that's Fade In?"
UnethicalLifeProTips,fdplvw9,t1_fdou3x4,1578632295.0,Thanks and congrats
Landlord,fdpltdq,t1_fdpiyl6,1578632236.0,"Man, you sound like my contractor when I broached the subject of doing AirBnB with my current places! Hell no,  and he'd quit working for me if I insisted! :)  
  
To be clear, I'm thanking you for the candid advice and now I'm leaning toward more mid level places like what I have now.  Thanks!"
