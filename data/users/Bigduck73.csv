sousvide,fclfysc,t1_fclcjr0,1577746892.0,Good idea! Do you remember what time and temperature?

sousvide,fcl8ppe,t1_fcl86sl,1577742233.0,"I've seen others talk about fridge pickles with their sous vide and I was wondering what the point was. I make fridge pickles without ever heating the cucumbers. But then when you mention those other vegetables, they might need just a little heat or they'd be too firm to be a good pickel"
sousvide,fcl86sl,t1_fcl6mq3,1577741906.0,I'll ask the dumb question. Are these shelf stable jars when you're done or do you put them in the fridge when you're done?
sousvide,fckym66,t1_fckyb0a,1577735987.0,Haha I probably wouldn't have even thought of it except I was literally scrolling through here the other day when the wife asked what the best way to melt chocolate would be. Super easy.
sousvide,fcky8ln,t3_ehr34e,1577735757.0,"I discovered it does a fantastic job of melting chocolate.
I also made some pretty good Mason jar pumpkin pie roughly using the recipe here https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/pumpkin-pie-in-a-jar"
Biltong,fckwq86,t1_fabjmd3,1577734837.0,"Update (finally). I give my experiment a solid B-. I hung my meat up in the 38 degree Fahrenheit garage and let it hang out in the open without any fan. It's a pretty big garage so there's plenty of dry air to disperse moisture and I figured the temperature, salt, and vinegar would keep mold away plenty long even if it took a long time at such a cold temperature.  I'm the wrong person to be doing a solid scientific experiment because I've never done it the right way before so I have no comparison. At day 6 it still felt a little squishy so I left it, got busy and came back day 8 and it was a little stiffer than what I'm guessing I wanted.  I also think I cut my strips for hanging a little on the thin side and didn't really care for the herb ensemble I used. But I ate it and didn't die!

todayilearned,fc4pgpb,t1_fc2tlps,1577423768.0,"""waste containing mercury and arsenic."" I mean even filtered tap water ""contains mercury and arsenic"" in small amounts. They could literally have had a municipal water supply leak and the headline would be accurate  They're citing the total volume to make it seem like a huge deal in the headline without saying anything about the concentration of the icky things. Sure they're evil or whatever, I'm just giving a lesson on never trusting  headlines."
CrazyIdeas,fc3zhhv,t3_efuwut,1577402650.0,"I did that!!!!!!!! It's great.  All at once in case they discontinue the style and so they all have a chance to break in kind of the same. Even when you can buy the same style again, you end up with ""pairs"" where one is about to fall apart and the other is brand new and it doesn't feel right."
