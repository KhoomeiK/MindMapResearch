offmychest,feg0oul,t3_eog7oh,1579071951.0,"I genuinely undermine my own value because i had a rough childhood and that makes me feel like im supposed to be a lot stronger than i actually am. Especially since i come from a situation where everyone had a rough time in their upbringing. I first realized that it was a toxic mindset when my mother got annoyed at me for calling her strong. Some times you cant be strong and you just want to be able to be in pain, or upset or sad. I have a mindset where negative emotions should be ""fixed"", but a lot of the time its more healing to just be allowed to be upset and have people support you."

Making light of trans issues or misrepresentation of what they are as people can be pretty harmful if said publically seing as trans people are already  quite a lot more likely to experience acts of violence than others. Not that this should influence your right to say what you want, but it's why people can react a bit strongly towards it. There is a sensitivity there."
