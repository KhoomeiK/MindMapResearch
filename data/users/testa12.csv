As I’ve mentioned if trump was actually implementing racially based policies now, I’d agree with you. But he is not and has upheld all anti discrimination policies already in effect. He has no anti black agenda."

I don’t know or care if Trump the individual actually subscribes to a racial superiority ideology. 

You’ve accused this play on words joke from a family with the last name Black as “erasing the real struggles of black people”. So unless you are accusing the actual family of doing that, you’re accusing Trump. And I don’t believe the Trump administration has done that at all."

Not caring about someone and believing in racial superiority ideology are two completely different things. I don’t care about you for instance and I don’t even know nor care about what race you are. So when you say something like this;

> Showing that you don't care about the struggles of black people is showing that you think they are inferior. 

You just come across as unhinged. Then when you say I have no argument, I just laugh."

By your logic, the very fact that they have the last name Black and are white republicans is racism. 

It’s seems obvious to me that the term racism has lost its original meaning and now just refers to anything determined to be offensive to anyone  who isn’t white. At least on reddit anyway. 

Once upon a time it was specifically used to denote those who subscribe to racial superiority/inferiority ideology."
facepalm,ff23qwq,t1_ff22dpf,1579492988.0,Racism is the ideology that one race is superior or inferior to any other. This doesn’t portray that ideology in any way dude. It’s a fucking joke aimed at people just like you.

Now how about we get him some help because as weird as this is to say, that was a paedophile that’s actually not a horrible piece of shit.

comics,fejpfun,t1_fejk2oq,1579182439.0,"In my perfect world, there’s significantly less people. So think back to when plains Indians lived in harmony with Bison for example. The bison weren’t just killed for meat but for a whole host of reasons. As the population increases, killing “wild” beasts is no longer sustainable. You’ll wipe them out. You need to domesticate them and bring in animal husbandry to make it sustainable.   We’ve got it to such a fine art that we keep only 4 main types of animal now for clothing and meat. It was sustainable until we realised their ass gas and land and water usage were not super efficient. This is literally no different to when they were wild and we domesticated them to increase efficiency. 

So let’s move forward to a world where we can’t increase their efficiency anymore and their impact is too great. Which is kind of the present time.  So we get rid of them all together. Now we have no leather or wool only cotton and everyone eats plants so we increase farming land to cover the short fall which is great because we actually need less than we did with the livestock. We solved the problem. Just like with the wild bison. Woohoo. Go team. 

The human race marches on. Until widescale plant farming has fucked the planet somehow... be it with pesticides or soil erosion or whatever. 

No matter which way you go, if you solve one problem you just end up with more people and a new problem. It’s been happening for thousands of years. There is nothing wrong with eating meat in moderation as humans have always done. The problem is there is too many of us consuming too much meat. As I said, there has always been grazing animals consuming water and farting. We’ve just bred a fuck tonne more than their should be. So when I say sustainable I’m talking about going back to the natural order of things. Back to the wild bison herd that was always there."

If there was 40,000 teenagers out picking up rubbish every afternoon or planting trees quietly, people would be inspired. People would feel guilty and eventually people would join. Instead we get 40,000 teenagers blocking traffic in the city and pissing everyone off and then leaving rubbish everywhere."

That we need to completely change our mantra on a global scale to one of caretaker, not consumer. We’re not here to reproduce mindlessly until we’ve consumed all resources like a locust plague. We’re here to protect."

Not that it’s single celled for long. It multiplies rapidly, which hilariously is one of the requirements for life. 

2: a human zygote/embryo is not a virus. No idea why you’re bringing them up. 

3: I haven’t provided a definition for life so not sure how you can say it’s wrong. 

4: you think a single celled zygote/embryo, the beginning of human life is not alive. You’re an idiot. Stop talking to me I’m done with you."

When a sperm and ovum fuse together they form a new distinct cell with different DNA to the original donor cells. If you can’t rationalise this as the beginning of new life I don’t know what to say to you anymore."
