Of course, Austria is not the same as Germany, and Ohio is not the same as Anaheim :) But hopefully this helps.

If you eat in a restaurant where you sit down, and you pay with credit card, the server/waiter may take your card away for a few minutes and return with the receipt. I notice in Germany that most servers carry a portable device to run the card right at your table. It's normal for us to put the card with the receipt, and have them take it back to run it on the restaurant computer. Then, you get your receipt back and can write down how much you want to leave for a tip, and sign the receipt. At places like McDonald's or Starbucks, and in the grocery store, they will just run the card at the register, so that isn't any different. :)

Many people treat their dogs like children. If it's May, you probably won't see dogs in public wearing clothing, but some people will put them in sweaters when it's cold. A lot of people like to talk about their dogs, and use ""he"" or ""she"" instead of ""it"" to refer to the dog. Other people like to ask dog owners about their dogs. ""Oh, your dog is so cute! Can I pet her? What's her name? What kind of breed is she? How old is she?"" and so on. We have dog parks, too, where people just let their dogs play together. I don't know if you have dog parks in Austria!

It is common to stop at fast food restaurants, coffee shops, gas stations, or even the grocery store to use the toilet. Most of the time, you don't have to buy anything to use it. I had a European friend who was very surprised by this -- that if I am driving and need to pee, I just find the nearest McDonald's. 

&#x200B;

Many restaurants will give you a LOT of ice when you order a soda pop. You can ask for light ice, or no ice. The pop might taste different to you because we use different sweeteners. (""Pop"" is what some Americans call a soft drink!) At most sit-down restaurants, the soda pop will come in a big plastic cup. At a fast-food place or a casual dining place, you can sometimes get your own drink so you can control how much ice to put in there. And you can always ask for  a cup of water. Most sit-down restaurants will give it to you, but I think at Del Taco or Chipotle or Starbucks or any fast-food place, it will not be offered but you can ask. It may be 25 cents or something, but they'll give you water. You don't need to buy it in a bottle unless you want to. Stay hydrated!"
