SweatyPalms,ff8vxai,t1_ff7w6cw,1579697879.0,"I worked for Bartlett for several years. There two paths I saw for becoming an arborist:

1) Work from the bottom up. Start as a ground man and start learning everything. 

2) Go to college and get a degree in forestry.

Just keep in mind that promotion generally involves eventually moving away from labor and into sales. I saw plenty of guys who really liked climbing but ended up just being salesme myn."

disneyvacation,fep7fx2,t1_fen61zm,1579313832.0,"I came here to say this exact same thing. Do you ever think of how clowning has become a lost art, and you almost never see clowns just being clowns?

These are some of my thoughts about clowns."
pettyrevenge,feovuew,t1_feooibh,1579306512.0,"Yea, exactly. There are so many variables. I agree. Just let people use the bathroom."
gadgets,feojucs,t3_eq23vh,1579301147.0,Good. Fuck Apple.
pettyrevenge,feoity4,t1_fengn6f,1579300782.0,"Sure, but he still pissed on himself instead of just completing the assignment. Wasn't that the caveat? So, a nine year old that would rather piss on himself than just do the assignment is disrupting the entire class and potentially ruining the learning opportunity of the entire class. Not to mention setting a ridiculous example for other students.

He's not some kind of respectable martyr. He's a kid who is apparently struggling so much in school that he'd rather fixate on a bathroom break than just do the assignment. That's not fair to the rest of the learning community and the custodians (whose job is not cleaning up protest piss) and unfortunate for that kid.

That said, it's simply better practice to both listen to kids and offer them equity, rather than make up draconian rules.

The name of the sub holds true, however. This was indeed petty revenge."

2healthbars,fen6kcq,t1_femyct4,1579278084.0,Yes.
2healthbars,fen6hvk,t1_femvqf6,1579278041.0,I don't know why you're getting downvoted. This clearly isn't appropriate for the sub. Rubber bands are stretchy and flexible.
WTF,fen61zp,t1_fen4j9r,1579277767.0,"Well there's gotta be a story behind that.

But yea, I suppose all those other things are potentially deadly as well, but let's not overlook the most immediate danger with the simplest solution."
WTF,fen47f4,t1_femuw07,1579276597.0,And a string.
pettyrevenge,femsafm,t1_fel0530,1579268174.0,"Seems like being 9 years old would stop most people from pissing their pants, considering most people are potty trained by that point. I'm betting that kid had other problems besides just having to wait to use the restroom."
awfuleverything,fektymc,t1_fekhdv4,1579207547.0,"Yes, exactly. Pretty much everyone is going to seem strange when you catch them when they think no one is looking and put them under a microscope. It's exactly why people watch reality TV. 

This is lazy content. And the difference is that most of the other stuff on this sub is stuff people chose to share, not voyeurism."

Unexpected,feblmfc,t1_febgsvo,1578960053.0,"Nah, but I am well versed in how nonsensical and foolish stereotypes can be."
Unexpected,febdt5f,t1_feam0rd,1578957801.0,"So, you want to avoid being stereotyped by people you have stereotyped as being the type of people who believe a false sterotype that you are in fact an exemplar of how it is a false sterotype?

Do I have that right?

We live in a society.

EDIT: Just to be clear, this was intended as a joke about the pressure placed on smokers to actively hide an activity that should, imo, be their legal right, because of an inappropriate sterotype of people who smoke (as lazy, ambitiousless losers)."
