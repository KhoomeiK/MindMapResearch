AskNYC,fdgt2qg,t1_fdefqtd,1578407610.0,"I think your reply has some serious bias.

Calling a worker a concierge has nothing to do with wages.  There are no loopholes.  A building is either union or non-union.   A union building cannot hire non-union staff. A union building must pay union wages regardless of title.  There are three classifications of residential union staff:  superintendent/resident manager, handyman, or other.  ""Other"" can be doorman or porter, both of which are the same wage classification.

A non-union building, usually newer buildings, are not required to follow union wage rules and are not part of any collective bargaining agreements. They can classify, call, name and pay their staff whatever they want.  They chose to be non-union, it's not a requirement by any law that a building must be union.

There are plenty of union buildings that have shitty staff members who have keys and access. Being in the union does not automatically guarantee the quality of the individual. Shitty people are everywhere."
