BeautyGuruChatter,ffjli4f,t3_etp30c,1580000993.0,"At work today, a dog came in for a nail trim and he was fine at first and then decided halfway through that he was done and lost his mind. He freaked out and expressed his anal glands EVERYWHERE. It got all over me, the wall and the dog that I had just finished grooming. I had to call the owners and explain to them that I have to wash their dog again. Luckily they weren’t mad at all. 

So that was my day."

I didn’t even realize Reddit had ads until I saw people complaining about it because I use Apollo and never see them."

doggrooming,ffhz9df,t3_et2km5,1579960097.0,"I’m not sure about the laws where you are, but here if a dog bites someone and the owners can’t show proof that the dog was vaccinated, the dog then has to be at best quarantined at the owners expense and worst case scenario, the dog has to be put down and tested for rabies. It’s not a “rare” occurrence either; generally I get bit hard enough to draw blood at least a couple of times a year with lots of minor bites in between. So your boss is not all about the well being of the pets. All they care about is not “inconveniencing” customers and they’re going to develop a reputation as the place people can go when they don’t feel like vaccinating their dogs but still need them groomed. 

I would say if you still enjoy what you do, look for a new job and when you go on interviews, ask them if they are on top of vaccination records. 

Also, not cleaning between dogs is just gross."
Cringetopia,fff0kss,t1_ffeb4ze,1579872336.0,"Would it help to not keep unhealthy snacks in the house? If you’re taking it at night and it makes you sleepy, you’re not going to be driving around to go get food."
thisismylifenow,fff0384,t1_ffeo7zh,1579871903.0,"I groomed cats for a while. Most of them take care of cleaning themselves on their own. Knots happen because owners aren’t brushing them enough. Certain breeds may knot up easier due to oily skin or whatever but that just means they need to be brushed more frequently. Some people will get their cats washed/professionally groomed to help keep the fur in a condition that’s easier to maintain. 

If she’s getting knots and you find yourself getting overwhelmed, I would seek out a groomer. Mats aren’t good for their skin and do cause discomfort."

However people have been injured/killed after being hit by other unsecured passengers in a car accident."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffexxsj,t1_ffer9rj,1579869881.0,You mean Michelle Carter. Always use her name so it comes up when you search for her on Google. I’m sure the dumb bitch will change her name but still.
AmItheAsshole,ffe6ojs,t3_eszvls,1579838134.0,You could have at least whipped together a salad dressing for her. I understand if the excitement of making your new dish outweighed your desire to make her a separate meal but you should have given her a heads up. YTA.
