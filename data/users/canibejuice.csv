I ended up doing a  Florida based accelerated 2 week avionics course and got a certificate of completion last April. I sent out my resume in my area (NW Florida) because we have a huge aviation industry and ended up getting a job working for Intel, of all places. I use more of what I learned of wire harnesses and such more for personal projects than for work but as an example, you could potentially get a job for Intel in OR. From my experiences so far, they are the best company I've ever worked for over the past 20 years.

The process went fairly smoothly, thanks to the help of Crutchfield and their master install sheets. I had my concerns about going from the factory harness to the after market head unit's harness, but a wire harness adapter came with it that matched up perfectly to the install sheet.

If you decide to ever give it a shot, make sure to always disconnect the battery when doing electrical work. You could always ask if you can watch while your car is getting installed and learn from the techs at the shop. Also, youtube is wealth of information about this. I came across a few videos that will help me sound dampening materials as well as running speaker wire through the door panels. Good luck with your build!"

explainlikeimfive,fdhyo6f,t1_fdhnulb,1578432562.0,"Depending on what school of thought you subscribe to, the Taoist believe it has to do with the essence that is released during ejaculation. The broad strokes of it are, women benefit twice when they have their own ejaculation couple with receiving their male partner's ejaculate. Male ejaculation in a mastubatory sense is considered harmful to the health at older ages because of the rate of generation of male essence. Around puberty and very early adulthood, its easy to regenerate it where as the older a male ages, the longer it takes to regenerate. Absorbing a female's essence during her ejaculation can offset the draining effects of male ejaculation to some degree."
