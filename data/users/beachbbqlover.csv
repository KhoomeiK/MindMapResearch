&#x200B;

The key to weight loss - maintaining your glycogen (bodyfat) levels is to stable caloric balance and/or deficit.  The whole effectiveness of keto for example lies in the fact that carbs spike and drop blood glucose faster than ingested fats, but there are tons of other factors such as when you eat relative to when you exercise, total input, appetite, salts, sugars, etc.

As far as being healthy, no, you don't need to count every fucking carb and vitamin microgram if you're in close approximation.  Humans have survived being out of dietary perfection for all of human history, and our bodies are awesome at adapting to that imbalance and making the averages work out.

So all we really need to do is make sure to get a bit of varied green stuffs, not skip protein altogether, and keep a rough caloric balance.  A healthy person can do this instinctively by appetite, but if that's broken then counting is a way to ""manually breathe"".

&#x200B;

So...

&#x200B;

The trick to going back to doing this automatically is to skip the counting and start developing acceptable recipes you like that are close enough to meeting your needs.  A few salads that are decent.  An acceptable amount of fish, etc.  Once you have those ideas in your head correctly, you no longer need to count calories.  Instead you're guestimating your meals with an eye to nutrition.
