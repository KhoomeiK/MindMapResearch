I stopped because I was feeling more comfortable with food&because due to some food allergies and intolerances I have it made things difficult, and my depression got worse so I stopped caring so much.

It did feel weird going back to meat but also a little liberating because I could eat meat without obsessing over the calories and such. However I do have my fair share of guilt of the animals and am trying to eat healthier, and want to go back. After going back you do have to start slow or you’ll get sick. 

I love cooking! I come from a Mexican family and always loved the cooking my family would do together when I was small, and I find it a relaxing hobby. I am lactose intolerant (severely although I don’t pay much attention to it lol)

I ghosted him for some months (had the Big Big Sad) and then one day we started talking and just never stopped. We’re long distance but have flown out to see eachother :)

Baby goats are THE BEST I watch so many videos of them. Turtles are great, I just like reptiles tbh. Foxes are definitely gorgeous! I do have a soft spot for zebras as growing up a neighbor had them (he also owned horses and donkeys) and I got to let them sometimes.

And I always thought I would love farm life but as I just moved to a rural town, I’m not sure. However I do enjoy some good old solitude and am a bit of a recluse,  so if I had a farm and it was just the animals&my man&i, I’m pretty sure I would love it! He’s from a more rural-ish state and is game. If it got too boring I would hitch a ride to the city for a while.

And snakes are so cute!! My boyfriend really wants one and so do I so we’re hoping to get one together one day.  I also really want a tarantula (I’m scared of small spiders but tarantulas are just so charming) 

I also have affection for goats. I have no idea why but they are just the cutest. If you could own any animal whatsoever, what would it be?"

I personally am terrible at art but I love all kinds, abstract is awesome, and I’m just amazing at what people can do with there hands sculpting wise.
