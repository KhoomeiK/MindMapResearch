The governments aren't supporting the industry, that's why it's failing. In the Scottish plant in Douenray, it had a working breeder reactor (basically makes more fuel as it goes), but it was shut down. Germany, for some bizarre reason, shut down every single nuclear plant.

One thing that made me chuckle a while ago in University was in an energy module, we had to come up with an energy policy for Australia (something three consecutive govts have failed to do lol) and the only restriction was no nuclear power. Not because its too dangerous or not efficient, bc it is too simple an answer and would make the project too easy.

britishproblems,ffhujd5,t1_ffgqpvb,1579954564.0,"From what I've learned, pesticides can definitely affect the environment. If they're rich in nitrates/phosphates they can cause eutrophication, which can absolutely destroy water ecosystems. Fertiliser is the main offender for that though.

I think the general issue is that higher yields require some sort of chemical additive to help it along, which is often gonna have unwanted side effects, e.g. reduced yield in the next crop cycle.  

Anything that is kinder to the animals is also gonna reduce profits so the firms are less likely to do it. Similarly, anything pertaining to better environmental impacts will also cost the company money, so unless somebody works out how to make a profit off *helping* the environment, nothing is gonna change.

Since I don't think anybody is close to making global scale profit off environmental stuff, the only option is through government intervention. It's why Greta Thunberg and other activists are so important; the naysayers will complain that they aren't doing anything to help, they're just whining, but in reality no one person can actually have any impact. If you look at the emissions stats nobody is gonna come close to what these multinational corporations are pumping out (e.g. [the sulphur pollution of one container ship is equal to 50 million cars](https://blog.elomatic.com/en/sulphur-emissions-does-one-ship-pollute-as-much-as-50-million-cars)). It's the government that need to do something because they're the only ones that can.

That said, I am hoping to get into an industry where I can have a bit of an impact. Anyway, I too have rambled on, I may check that podcast out once my exams are over..."

britishproblems,fff4wfs,t1_ffciq65,1579875778.0,"My course is engineering so we take things from that perspective, on the large scale rather than small, which is what organic operations tend to be.

Organic is definitely inefficient though, which is why they're more expensive - economy of scale doesn't apply. This is generally the issue with any technological breakthrough that supposedly reduces emissions: if it can't be scaled up to be commercially viable its not gonna make a difference. 

Some places have come up with organic alternatives to pesticides that sort of manage the pests without using chemicals, but they aren't as effective.

I don't really know about organic actually being worse, I can't see how it would be worse apart from being less efficient and therefore more expensive."
