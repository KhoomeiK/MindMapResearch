Apparently Jupiter was much closer to the sun in the beginning of the formation of the planets and wandered quite a bit in different orbits, before it settled to where it is now. During this period it is theorized, that Jupiter gobbled up much of the material of the inner planes, thus leaving not enough material behind to form super-earths, but only regular earths (Earth and Venus) and mini-earths (mercury and mars)."

Applying everywhere would be madness, as in the immediate vicinity of my small hometown alone there are nearly 300 open jobs in software development at the moment. So, I either read through some of them and pick a handful of the most interesting companies, or a specific company catches my eye by chance. In any case, I thought about why I would prefer to work at this company instead of another company and therefor have a reason aside from money."

Also trying to do a counterattack while simultaneously blocking is more or less the standard thing to do, you only do simple parries when you have no other choice/way to prevent being hit."
