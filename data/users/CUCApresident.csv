watchpeoplesurvive,ff34hu3,t3_er1j63,1579533459.0,I thought the comments on this would be about how distressing it is to hear the frightened screams of those poor confused children. Instead it’s all iTs a HeRdiNg tEChNiQUe
TIHI,felmmnv,t3_epqxpm,1579225808.0,Omg couple goals!!!!
AmItheAsshole,fdr2iq4,t3_emr755,1578678637.0,"YTA. It’s perfectly natural that he wondered why both methods failed, so did you! You’d only been together for 6 months, why should he unquestioningly believe you’re a perfect saint?"
ProductPorn,fdqzm6q,t3_emlnls,1578677460.0,This reminds me of those hot glue gun “hacks”

BeansInThings,fdh49ug,t1_fc9ch9c,1578415059.0,I want to see someone with those earlobe stretchers just pop a bean in there
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdfck2g,t1_fdfc72d,1578358494.0,"Exactly, it’s very specific to the individual. I’ve had depression for years and tried lots of different birth control and it’s never changed anything for me.


Edit: I don’t understand why this is being downvoted? The internet is mean"
weddingshaming,fdbfsxl,t3_ekeodg,1578256964.0,Yeahhhhhh I wouldn’t wear it
cambridge,fdac081,t1_fd9sa71,1578244363.0,"Yeah the Punter is good, a bit less central than some of the others but it’s got more space if you’re a big group and still feels pub-ish"
AmItheAsshole,fd49ihv,t3_ejuz1p,1578165596.0,"NTA, reading this makes my blood boil. For your cousin to deliberately go against your wishes at your own mothers funeral is absolutely disgusting."

weddingshaming,fcxpcp1,t3_ehv5ja,1578068328.0,"I don’t really get the joke? Cos it’s not a song about being single it’s about a break up. That said, its a funny song and it’s your wedding, so put whatever spin on it you like!"
relationship_advice,fcvt88g,t3_ej3aq7,1578009571.0,"Consider whether there are any other explanations for why she’s saying these things. For example, has a friend of hers recently been cheated on? Has she suffered a family breakdown in the past? Could she just be repeating what her mother has told her to say?
People can say and do strange things when they think they are “protecting” themselves. I would talk to her again, and find out how deeply she holds these beliefs. And if this is how she genuinely feels, I would encourage you to dump her ass."
AmItheAsshole,fcvp173,t3_eizz56,1578006876.0,"YTA. She didn’t bail, you uninvited her son and by extension her. As soon as she explained that she couldn’t get cover for him you should have made the call that it’s more important she come than for your in-laws to drink."
Cringetopia,fbz61qh,t3_ef1xje,1577236181.0,This has such a strong cringe energy I can’t even bring myself to turn the sound on
