That person is just projecting their inability to stay on a diet"
demonssouls,fgn3qf6,t3_eyfgsd,1580937126.0,"So many to choose from. I’d say Flamelurker, Phalanx, Tales of Old, the One One. But Flamelurker is my favorite for sure"
titanfolk,fgkg1gw,t1_fgjsb7z,1580864712.0,I hope you’re right but after this chapter I’ve set my expectations pretty low
DeadSpace,fgkfzue,t1_fgk5gmo,1580864681.0,It was

titanfolk,fgjrbrp,t3_eyrx2l,1580849866.0,So I guess Yams is going for the Code Geass ending except here Eren might literally want to destroy the world- well unless we get an asspull change where the team up was his intention all along
titanfolk,fgjq5yk,t1_fgiwu67,1580849214.0,I thought he would kill Connie’s mom when that picture of Erwin was show. It would have been a hard decision but Erwin would have definitely done it
DeadSpace,fgjnlsp,t3_eyh9ov,1580847733.0,I saw a sealed one on eBay for $50 last year
DuelMasters,fgjmdka,t3_eyp73w,1580847016.0,"I had the full set at one point - including the Japanese sets. They were indeed terrible figures - cheap, gummy plastic and barely and detail so you couldn’t even repaint them if you wanted. I ended up throwing the entire collection away"
AnimeFigures,fgedaef,t3_exy79e,1580696921.0,Excellent choice with Hestia sir
fatlogic,fgebzqs,t3_exvw7x,1580696098.0,He/she forgot to mention that they eat like 8000 calories a day probably

resinkits,fg5vi65,t1_fg5i0dl,1580540586.0,"I use a taobao agent called Superbuy and I mostly buy all my figures from one specific [seller](https://shop144766485.taobao.com/?spm=a1z10.3-c.0.0.76946d0b4XFH3m)

Never had any issues with them. However from what I understand, the preorder window for Asuka closed. I remember seeing her being sold via preorders a few weeks ago on taobao. The manufacturer preorders have closed so now the only other way to get her is from a scalper which is basically what fanaticanimestore is. If you preordered on taobao it would be like half the price. But that site is definitely legit.

With all that said, I would refrain from buying anything from China for a few weeks due to the coronavirus issue."
resinkits,fg5ebfg,t3_eww66m,1580525194.0,I'm sure that site is fine. I usually buy all my Chinese resin figures directly on taobao and it's a lot cheaper too.
minipainting,ffzxnyd,t3_evuezd,1580395535.0,Damn that is excellent dude!
resinkits,ffzxds5,t1_ffzhuuw,1580395337.0,Yep MFC is definitely the way to go.
resinkits,ffy1ra9,t3_evpkwg,1580336860.0,"Shipping stuff with E2046 Airmail takes 1-2 weeks to arrive for me. USPS does provide tracking once the item arrives in the country.

MMORPG,ffup7gf,t3_ev7an7,1580246655.0,I’ll believe it when I see it.
AnimeFigures,ffra07u,t1_ffr53ah,1580153689.0,Fair enough sir. I like how they designed his mask and hair in this iteration
AnimeFigures,ffr2b05,t1_ffqi78i,1580148905.0,Cool! I've always thought about getting that statue. I do have the 1/6 Jason from Freddy vs Jason by Sideshow.
AnimeFigures,ffqi67d,t3_euhqhd,1580135277.0,Is that the Freddy vs Jason version in the middle? I love his design in that film

ImaginaryMonsters,ffe68p6,t3_et0wrw,1579837795.0,I'd floor it
fatlogic,ff8ee9f,t3_ern4q3,1579674958.0,This is easily achieved doing keto with a calorie deficit. And maybe some IF/OMAD thrown in
DeadSpace,ff4sbe9,t3_er84ls,1579571251.0,Definitely the classic slasher. I love its design
minipainting,ff4mt5m,t3_erdc95,1579567419.0,I love the pose and armor on the Obi-Wan mini
saltierthancrait,ff3ex6g,t3_erd5nn,1579539673.0,Honestly the helmet and the crossguard saber are the only things I like about the DT. The helm reminds me of starkiller's helm from the DLC
AnimeFigures,ff3eohu,t3_erdphm,1579539540.0,Fantastic. They are positioned perfectly!

AnimeFigures,fedev1v,t3_eoh1b3,1579009593.0,Very nice!
AnimeFigures,fe949n8,t1_fe8me96,1578934078.0,"Yeah, I'm waiting to see how it looks when preorders are up. But as of right now, the head sculpt leave a lot to be desired."
resinkits,fdsv6ji,t3_en0kr6,1578708360.0,Very impressive! I love that color scheme
