Spurs vs **Leipzig** - I don't know the Leipzig team well enough, they seem more than capable to outscore Spurs though. Mou more than likely will be extra cautious and will try to slow Leipzig down and try to hit them in transition. I'll go with Leipzig as the schedule favors them and like what their young manager has done so far.

**Atletico** vs Liverpool - this is a lot closer than many people think. Atletico are more than capable of knocking off Liverpool. I can see them try to hold on to the ball, starve Liverpool of possession and sneak out a 1-0 or 2-1 at home followed by a lucky draw in the second leg. Atletico.

Dortmund vs **PSG** - BVB are going to be fun to watch with Haland and the boys. I don't see them progressing though, their manager seems incapable of setting them up tactically for a win, they've become very vulnerable to a counter as well. PSG.

Atalanta vs **Valencia** - no idea here. Both teams go from hot to cold and back to hot as they please. I'll go with Valencia simply because the schedule favors them.

**Chelsea** vs Bayern - most seem to favor Bayern here but this matchup is ripe for an upset. Bayern have an unproven manager, are very inconsistent and their midfield is unbalanced. Chelsea haven't won anybody over with their recent form but they're the underdog here and nobody expects them to beat Bayern over two legs. But I think they might just sneak in.

Napoli vs **Barcelona** - Setien got a dream job. His honeymoon will continue for now, Napoli with Gattuso at the helm are playing like a midtable team, no matter what they try to do at home they'll get destroyed at Camp Nou.

Lyon vs **Juventus** - Juventus. Lyon doesn't have the firepower to match juve.

**Madrid** vs City - A shit draw for Pep. City are no match for Real. The Spanish royals are too good at everything and way too experienced to lose against City."
