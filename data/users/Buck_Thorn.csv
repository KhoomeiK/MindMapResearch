Workbenches,fff8iqf,t1_fff7ht8,1579878365.0,"Actually, I did build mine to 34"" tall,  58 1/2"" long by 21"" deep but you can quite easily size it to your needs.  Top is 3 3/4"" thick.

The hardest part for me was chopping out the mortises for the legs.  I used a plunge router with a 1 1/2"" long 3/4"" straight bit to remove the bulk, then a Forstner bit to cut through the last inch or so that the router bit didn't reach.  But chiseling that pine end grain was a bit of a challenge, even with very sharp chisels.  And I had to continually flip and rotate that 100 pound dead weight a number of times to get to all of them.

It was also  tough working in my already tiny and crowed shop.  I have my planer and jointer both on the same flip-top stand (a choice I would re-think if I were to do it again) and all of my power tools on casters but was constantly having to move things to get to things.  It is still that way, but soon I will begin tearing down and removing the old bench that was already an ancient cobbled together POS when I bought this house 26 years ago."
