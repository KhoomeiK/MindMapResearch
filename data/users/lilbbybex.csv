Raccoons,fdh19cc,t1_fdgnjfw,1578413188.0,"so i found this lil dude in my backyard! im thinking his mama dropped him (kind of a common thing since they carry around so many babies at once) he was not doing well, way too little to survive on his own. being a vet tech (for small domesticated animals) i wasnt too sure how to care for him but i did some research and everything that i was finding was saying to treat like i would a kitten. i was also heavily researching raccoons as pets and apparently they are extremely difficult to keep as pets (i mean, they are wild animals lol) i kept this lil dude for a few weeks, enough to get him bigger and stronger (he was SO sweet, he def thought i was his mama!) after strongly considering w my housemates wether or not to keep him as pet (it was really hard to give this cutie up!) we came to the decision that it would be best to find a rehabber and to get him back into the wild, which is what we did. but this was such a fun few weeks of having him!"
