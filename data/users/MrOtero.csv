unpopularopinion,ff97lua,t3_esd91y,1579706713.0,"I am sorry, but it is not true to say than only ""small, homogenous"" countries can have a Social Security Health system. It depends on how a country manages the taxes it collects and its priorities. In every developped country with Social Security the system is directly managed by smaller administrative units (i. e. Regions or states), some of them with bigger population than some USA states, and would do it exactly the same if they were much bigger countries by following the same pattern. And I am also talking about countries with different regional languages and different level of internal development.
The result is that Americans are the biggest expenders in health per person in the World but a mediocre performer as a country compared with other developped countries according to the WHO, and that's due to the USA dependence on the insurance and health industries lobbies.

Theirs only.
