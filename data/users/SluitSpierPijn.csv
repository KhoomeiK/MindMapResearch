FORTnITE,ffa7nia,t1_ffa6qxm,1579729471.0,"I have a main account and a smurf account, the smurf is only pl25 so I get to experience what plank and stone are like right now when playing pl appropriate missions, and, having experienced end game content, imo low pl content is in a horrible state right now, mostly thanks to the anti leech system. 

Either you get matched with people who are constantly whining to trade, some even sabotage the objective when they get ignored. OR you get matched with high pl players who are farming evo mats, and it’s an uphill battle from the start till the end

Almost nobody is mindful of their own scores, so usually when I play pubs on the smurf account, I have to do missions multiple times to get the alerts. Ain’t nobody got time for that. If I had to get that smurf account to 130 like that, even to 100, I would just quit the game. Thankfully I know better, but I can’t imagine many people enjoying this once they understand how much they’re getting screwed over

Happens even on my main account when I’m the only constructor in a group mission for example. I know this is preaching to the choir, but: playing as a constructor, building the entire base, AND having to go kill in the spawn, to get your alerts, is not good PvE game design, at all. It encourages competitiveness in a gamemode that’s about teamplay, whoever thought this would be a good idea should honestly find a new job, because ruining good games with horrible ideas, that ain’t it."

Building the entire base AND having to join the spawn raping completely beats the purpose of playing constructor, might as well go outlander too and just spam teddy, instead of risking not getting your rewards because everyone does crazy dmg while you sit there on a base that yields little to no score

Even bringing back the old constructor build reduction would be great, since most people don’t care about the mission modifier anyways, so I doubt it’ll be abused or make constructors too good"

FORTnITE,ff9rg4u,t1_ff9he2n,1579719477.0,"I started a smurf account because of the sale, honestly, I can’t understand what epic is thinking when it comes to low pl gameplay. Doing the vbucks missions in pubs is horrendous, I just do them on private with friends, but trying to do them with randoms is near impossible, my smurf account is only PL25 but I almost exclusively get matched with PL80+ players who for some reason usually refuse to pay attention to their combat score or at least drop a 106. If I do those missions in pubs on my main I always make sure I’m not screwing over a low pl player who also simply wants their rewards

I don’t think these high pl players are doing anything wrong though, it’s just a bad system overall that doesn’t encourage proper teamplay, you shouldn’t have to pay attention to your score just so you don’t screw over other players, it’s a damn PvE game not PvP."

I’m aware what sub I’m in, but constant wallowing in negativity doesn’t help anyone.  Not everyone will ostracize you, but if that’s what you tell yourself constantly, I can definitely see why it would feel that way. 

I’m sure people will tell me I’m wrong, but: I felt like that for 28 years. Then I finally found the courage to tell pretty much everyone I know, and while some have left for good, others left and came back, and there’s even the handful who never went anywhere. Despite the fact that I was 100% certain everyone would abandon me, I was proven wrong.

(And in case something inside your head is now saying “yeah well that dude probably didn’t have it that bad then”, listen, I’m 32, I’m poor, I’m an addict and I’ve never held an actual job for more than a couple of months, I tend to isolate myself completely for up to half a year, ignoring everyone around me, even if they try, and STILL there is at least one person who’s still there every time I emerge from my hibernation. Why is that? Because most people have empathy, it’s part of being human, and empathy doesn’t always show itself until it absolutely needs to. That’s why it often seems like the world is a cold and bitter place. In reality, it often isn’t, it’s just really hard to see that if you’re already struggling emotionally)

depression,feo1ufx,t1_fenzxra,1579294039.0,"The whole idea behind ayahuasca, at least traditionally, is ego death though. There is nothing left of your ego once you’ve shit yourself and threw up your stomach’s contents, certainly not when it happens in a group of people (even if they’re also all tripping balls), which is how ayahuasca is usually consumed (in a group setting)

You could technically slowly kill the ego I guess, or at least try to tame it, with modern pharmaceuticals, but I think part of the “appeal” of ayahuasca, at least for me, is the fact that it’s a swift blow to your ego

When your ego gets in the way of your life, sometimes all it needs is a bullet. A lot of people have difficulties understanding what that’s like, but I’ve experienced ego death and it’s the most liberated I’ve ever felt, I literally couldn’t care anymore what people thought of me, in a good way, the empathy was still there, but the crippling self doubt, projected insecurities etc were all gone, that’s the ego that’s killed/silenced, and I have yet to achieve the same thing with modern medicine OR therapy for that matter"
Anxiety,feo0g7p,t3_eq5gui,1579293493.0,"I can’t give a whole lot of advice, but for me, when I used to have panic attacks, what really helped me was when a friend reminded me of my breathing, and talked me through the attack. I think it’s common to forget how/when to breathe when you’re having a panic attack (that’s where the hyperventilating into a bag comes from) and that adds even more stress to your body. 

Focusing on your breath both helps because you need the oxygen, and it gives you something to focus on in general, but it’s very easy to forget that, so it helps to have someone guide you through

depression,fenfcw5,t1_femz70m,1579283487.0,"As a former weed junky, I think this is horrible advice, honestly. If you have mental issues and don’t smoke weed yet; please don’t start smoking weed... chances are, it’s going to backfire tremendously

Alcohol is horrible, but weed can be too, and I’m living proof of that. I used to be convinced weed was amazing, I didn’t feel bad anymore. Until at one point I realised I felt even WORSE whenever I wasn’t high. Now, just like being an alcoholic, you’re both depressed *and* addicted to weed. I couldn’t eat before I smoked at least 3 bowls, obviously, working on your issues is not that easy if you also need to be high pretty much 24/7 to even function (barely). Also, I don’t know what kind of weed you’re smoking but most people don’t get energy from smoking weed, like, quite the opposite...

If you feel a constant craving, talk to a psychiatrist, there are other ways besides illegal substances. It’s normal to feel a big empty hole inside of you that you want to fill with something, but by trying to fill that hole by yourself, you’re likely just digging deeper, not filling anything"

Sometimes I like to imagine there are infinite universes, and in some of them, I did make the right choice, and I’m happy there. Doesn’t really help with this life, but it does help get me over that idea of “if only”, I just got unlucky and made the wrong choice in a sea of infinite choices

Edit; seriously fuck whoever the piece of shit was that thinks it’s ok to go around this sub and downvote people who are sharing deeply personal thoughts and ideas

If there’s anything you disagree with, hit the reply button instead of downvoting like a brainless ignorant pos who enjoys spreading negative karma. I hope karma comes to bite you in the ass one day and you’re on the other side of the line. May you not run into some pos who downvotes your personal struggles for no reason. Absolutely pathetic, why tf do I even comment in thus sub anymore.

One thing I try to tell myself is the fact I’m not active on social media has a lot to do with it, and it probably kinda does, people don’t really remember birthdays anymore... they get a notification “that dude you knew in high school just turned 30!” and so they’re reminded. Maybe they just care more about those people, who knows, just don’t beat yourself up too much over it, you’re not alone :)"

I’ll be watching this thread, don’t feed into OP’s negativity no matter how much they want it. Thread reported, this is a very slippery slope."

So little going on in life that you’re just “happy” there’s something that sets you apart, even if it’s the fact that you shit in a bucket

People want to feel unique/special, I guess when you’re too depressed to leave the house, at some very, very deep and dark point, even shitting in a bucket sets you apart, in a way... obviously 4chan is one of the only places that embraces that, for whatever reason"
depression,fenc3ce,t3_eq1xd4,1579281494.0,"I feel 100% the same way. 

I’m not sure if I’m allowed to talk about this here, I’m not advocating drug use, but I used to be addicted to ketamine (no lego yoda joke, I’m being serious) and when I binged k, I would feel like my life was a video game too, except, I was the main character, like, life was GTA and I could achieve anything, I just had to go for it. Obviously not run people over, but, making new friends, work wherever I want to, all that stuff that I think “normal” people don’t have as much trouble with as I do

This is such a contrast with how I feel when I’m sober, and I hate it... nothing has ever come close to that feeling, I’ve been looking to get ketamine therapy but they don’t offer it where I live, so for now, I’m just trying whatever is available, without anti depressants, because if there’s one thing worse than being an NPC, it’s being an asexual NPC with medically induced impotence"

Please don’t give yourself a life sentence, whatever it is you did, I think (almost) everyone deserves a second chance

My physical injury has been feeling like “punishment” a lot lately, but it’s also healing, so it feels like my jail time is almost served, I paid for what I did. I just hope my mind will follow that logic!"

On the positive side, I do have the idea the once I’m healed physically, I paid my price and I get a second chance, so on that note, at least I’m looking forward to trying again, which is a massive improvement compared to even a year ago, when the physical injury was also there but I wasn’t even thinking about improving myself, I just felt horrible about every aspect in life"

NeckbeardNests,fen9778,t1_fen4fdi,1579279709.0,"Good point! I think I found a solution, sort of.

If you take your garbage to the local dump here, you can pay them to get rid all kinds of garbage without sorting it, they just weigh your trash, you pay them, and it gets shredded or whatever. It’s mostly used for demolition, like when they renovate a house and need to get rid of a container full of wood, plastic, glass, everything. But you can pretty much dump whatever there since you pay for it. Going to fill a big black bag with whatever else I need to get rid of, and add as many bottles as I can. I guess doing that a couple times should solve it!"
NeckbeardNests,fen8m48,t1_fen6g1x,1579279354.0,"Unfortunately I’ve tried this before but it’s even slower than taking them out to throw them in the trash 1 by 1, since I live with 6 other people and there is literally only 1 toilet in the entire house, which happens to be in the room next to the kitchen. Also, two of my housemates are currently unemployed so there’s almost always someone around, and since they don’t have any issues (that I know of), they do spend most of their time in the shared rooms"
NeckbeardNests,fen8asv,t1_fen473e,1579279161.0,"Thank you for understanding, this is the exact situation I am in right now. I live with 6 other people, the only bathroom is on the ground floor, you have to go through the living area *and* the kitchen to get there, so every time I need to use the bathroom, I usually run into at least 2 people. Depression and, more importantly, severe social anxiety make this a lot harder than it *should* be. 

It also doesn’t help that there’s literally **one** toilet in the entire house, so even when I do go downstairs, chances are it’s in use, and I have to make small talk while waiting to use the bathroom. All that added up lead to this point unfortunately

I don’t enjoy being this person at all, I wasn’t always like this, or course I’d rather just go downstairs and use the bathroom instead of living like a homeless person in my own house, but things are what they are."

Perhaps I’m putting way too much thought in this, is there even anything illegal about throwing away full bottles that just so happen to be full of piss?

We do have kinda strict rules about trash where I live, everything has to be sorted so that does add to the paranoia, the last thing I want to have to do is explain myself after getting in some kind of trouble for doing that"

(I hope) nobody is going to help with that if I’m brutally honest. Instead I hope you focus on the fact that you *can* get better, just read the “success” stories on this sub if it’s numbers you’re after. There are no guarantees sadly, but nobody ever got better by thinking they never would. It’s very understandable and common to want to think that, the depressed mind wants to stay that way, it’s self preservation applied in a very strange way, but you should try not to give into it, you can do this, even if it will take time and work"

I wish I had a solution, I do the same thing even though I shouldn’t.

For what it’s worth, exposing yourself to the *right* people (in group sessions for example) can and will help with this, the more people prove your thoughts wrong, the weaker those thoughts become, but it takes a very long time to get rid of the conditioning if it’s been there for years.

(For example: saying something in a group, then regretting it, but also saying you regret it, so others can tell you there’s nothing to regret, will slowly but surely kill that internalised voice of regret/shame/guilt/... Group therapy is great for this, I’m not sure I’d recommend doing that in a regular group of acquantainces/friends though)"

I also blame my parents even though I’m kinda past the point of blaming, they raised me as best as they could, made lots of mistakes along the way, but that’s nothing I or they can change anymore

But I’m stuck with the end product though (myself and my hatred for myself) and that’s something a lot of people fail to understand, you can be past the point of blaming others, but that doesn’t mean you are healed, I feel like damaged goods and I’ll always remain damaged goods

I don’t really cook anymore even though it’s one of my fav things to do, I literally never have the kitchen to myself and having people watch me cook takes away the relaxing aspect and introduces stress, so it’s not something I currently do anymore (though I would eat so much better on the same budget if I would make it myself, but I’ll get there again, just takes some time)"
