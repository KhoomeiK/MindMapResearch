aww,fdpttt5,t1_fdprt0t,1578640222.0,"I live near kangaroos, the people in my neighbourhood genuinely love them and feel happy when they see them. It is true they are food for some people and animals, but they are not similar to rats and judging by all the work people are putting in to look after them the majority of Australians love them."
aww,fdpqw1u,t1_fdpm6vy,1578637081.0,"No. We are very proud of them, they are on our coins and coat of arms. We do have a lot of them though if that's what you meant."
aww,fcpltj8,t1_fcpdz39,1577867115.0,"Me too. My Mum always says ""I'm going to Google that up"" and it makes me laugh."

It is much nicer to think that than the animals were homeless because people are shitty."

cats,fcjmsxp,t1_fcjiuss,1577694294.0,"Years ago I read on Reddit someone saying that their Grandma believed that when you get to heaven God asks you ""did you get that stray cat/dog I sent you?"".  You are supposed to be able to say yes. Funny how cute little things stick in your mind sometimes."
