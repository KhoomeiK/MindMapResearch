Uniqlo’s sizes even in Japan tend to run a little bigger than other clothing stores in Japan I think... though to be honest I completely lack confidence in shopping at most other clothing stores and one of the major reasons I’m working to lose weight is so I can fit into all the cute clothes here"
AskWomen,ffbpugd,t1_ffbmy5y,1579777725.0,"Probably you’re hearing the worst of it, but it’s definitely there...

This is my conjecture but it’s a toxic combination of unchecked male privilege, highly stressful and busy lives, and rigid gender roles which leads to people releasing stress in more “deviant” ways. Also a very high population density which means even very niche interests and fetishes have a market.

Guys I’ve dated have been pretty normal and not that different to western guys, but I’ve also been groped and harassed on the train by other men.

Gonna edit to add: that being said Western media loves to report on “weird” Japan, whether it’s “sexual deviancy” or “sexless marriages” but these issues make great juicy clickbait headlines but in reality are the extremes of behavior, not necessarily the norm."

AmItheAsshole,fex1a93,t3_eqpkz1,1579422685.0,"NTA My partners dog passed away last week, after suffering more than she should have. She was really old and sick with a uterine infection, had become unable to walk, and stopped eating and drinking, which in my mind meant that she was ready to go, and the kindest thing to do would have been to euthanize her. I admit it’s probably very easy for me to say though because I had no real emotional investment...I came along only 2 years ago(the dog was 19) and I’m kind of scared of dogs so I just kept my distance. 

He couldn’t let go and I don’t think was being very objective, and clinging to the chance that maybe she would get better if they tried surgery. She lasted only a week after that, and still couldn’t walk and was also now incontinent, but my partner and his mum were too hopeful and were trying to help her walk, but she still wouldn’t really eat except for a little bit of her treats. 

She ended up dying alone in another room, with the week leading up to that seeming really undignified, while we were eating breakfast and even though I don’t really like dogs I thought that was really sad, and if they had chosen to put her to sleep she could have gone peacefully and not in pain, with her people around her.

After seeing that, if one of my babies(I have three ferrets) was in the same situation in the future, I think I would choose to put them to sleep, so I definitely agree that you did the right thing for your cat!"
fatlogic,ferry5l,t3_eqgo9g,1579357674.0,"Yeah no. I’m a short stocky woman, and have fairly big boobs and butt. I’ve been weight training the past year and have gained a reasonable amount of muscle. Last time I was weighed for my annual health exam the doctor even expressed that I seemed surprisingly heavy for my size (I’m quite overweight though)

The difference it makes to my weight compared to my weight if I had a thinner build and didn’t weight train is literally only 5 kilos or so, so at most the upper end of a healthy BMI for my height or 1 or 2 kilos over.

Not  ‘I’m not obese I’m just big boned and have muscles BMI is lies healthy people can technically be obese by BMI”"

Seeing how she ate made me realise just how much morbidly obese people eat to maintain that weight. We all got together for my birthday a few years ago, and were waiting to be seated at a sushi restaurant. While we were waiting another friend pulls out these 2 huge boxes of avocado chocolates that she had made, one was a birthday present for me, there other to share with everyone. Obese girl ate almost the whole box, everyone else ate one or two to try, since we were literally waiting to be seated to eat dinner. At dinner she ate the most sushi, and then on her way home also bought kfc... and that was only in the evening!

AskReddit,fd5xd48,t3_ejubhh,1578182692.0,"I always wanted to live in Tokyo, went to Japan teaching on the JET programme, and was placed in a place the complete opposite, in a tiny fishing town that wasn’t even in the mainland. I was a bit dubious at first, but was like well I got this far might as well, can always try to get a job in Tokyo later.

I loved living in that tiny town, and gained such a profound respect for living simply and close to nature, and when the time came to move on I realised I absolutely did not want to live in a big city like Tokyo or Osaka, and ended up in northern Japan in a regional city that I felt had the best balance of nature and convenience. Made friends, found some new hobbies(I’m a total potato but I fell in love with snowboarding), liked my job...and then I met a guy from Tokyo.

So now I live in Tokyo and...I do not love it. There’s a lot of things I like, such as endless cafes and restaurants and amazing stationary stores that I can spend hours in, but commuting is stressful and the air quality is not so good, and while I love my job in Tokyo, I have no time to do anything other than work, eat, sleep and maybe squeeze 30 mins of free time during the week, and people aren’t as friendly as other places I’ve lived and travelled to in Japan.
