Not a series, but an amazing novel from 1983. I've been casting it in my head long enough to have had a few generations of actors. Supposedly it's been under option for many years. 

Five wayward teens are sent by their parents to an exclusive picturesque boarding school in Vermont to be killed. 
They are:

Coke, lean, lanky and bitter has trouble keeping his shirttails in and has packed cigarettes and white rum in his backpack.

Sully, small and naive hates his life in New York City and his mother’s “manfriend”.

Marigold, foul-mouthed, funny and cynical has slept with one of her mother’s boyfriends.

Sarah, athletic, organized and popular is an over-achiever who cheated on an English paper.

Ludi, who can see things and hear sounds that are not “there”, has ways and attitudes that enrage her father.

Nat Rittenhouse, the school’s hired assassin and leader of the orientation 'group of 6' ends up bonding with the group, tells them what is meant to happen to them and assists them to survive in the woods near the school."
