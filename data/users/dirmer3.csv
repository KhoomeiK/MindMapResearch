The thing is, I'm not trying to start my own company. All I want to be involved in is growing the plant. I work on a vegetable farm now, so I'm not in this for the money. I worked in offices for years, but there's nothing more rewarding than seeing a crop through from seed to harvest.


I have friends who grow for the black market and they're doing well. They just don't need a staff and they don't grow 1000 plants. So, job prospects are limited there.


I grow in my backyard every year but never sell it. Money is not what drives me. Doing something I enjoy, does."

Once outside, mother nature does the lions share of the work. Grown organically in soil, it's a very easy plant to grow. No need for supplemental lighting or anything.


I grew 6 plants in my tiny backyard this year and they grew around 12-14 feet tall. On a single plant, I harvest around 2 pounds.
