Python,ffab6dg,t1_ffa1qqh,1579731469.0,"Apologies for the tone that was carried across, it's just that your explanation wasn't exactly clear so it seemed like you had a clear idea of what you do, but wasn't clear on how to provide the code to run it.  Regardless, I didn't mean to be condescending so my bad for not being considerate.

As mentioned, if you wanted a GUI dialog box, `tkinter.simpledialog` would be a good module to look at.  It already have several options to display messages, type of responses, etc.  `PyQT5` is also a good alternative though I haven't used.  The bottom line is that if you don't want to manage the low level stuff, find a package that works for you and run with it.

For your custom functions, you'll need to either ensure your file directory is in your PATH, or explicitly manage the path across your scripts.  The reason for that is python needs to know where to look for your files.  Preferably, you'd have these prepared as a package and pip install them so your can load them up anywhere.  Barring that, having your script run from the root which also includes the sub packages might be an alternative, which allows a certain level of relative imports.  As mentioned, looking up tutorials on how to package your python script is a great starting point, it shouldn't be too hard to follow."

Python,ff948ct,t1_ff8n0zr,1579704457.0,"1. The fundamental of programming is explicitly telling the program what you want to do though.  A computer is not magic, majority of the time a program doesn't work is because we aren't correctly telling it what to do, or it conflicts with other instructions given.     That's why there are modules out there, basically templates built by other developers to save you time on a similar implementation.  Dialog window is just that as well.  There is a `simpledialog` module in `tkinter` if that's what you're going for.

2. Same point as before, a program is only as good as the clarity of instructions provided.  We need to be the one to ensure the program knows exactly where to look for which file.  If you wanted something more generic like importing as a module, perhaps look into tutorials on how to build a python package/module.  It's not too difficult to follow.

Happy coding!"

From one parent to another soon-to-be: you might want to reconsider introducing sugary treats that early.  They literally are not missing out on anything without these junk good.  You'll only end up wondering why your kid won't listen when there's sugary treats involved, or why they won't sleep, or why they are so hyperactive, and all sorts of behavioral issues.

Unless you're prepared to deal with all those headaches, delay the treat to as late as possible.  Or make it very clear it's a special occasion (i.e. Why it's a bad idea to introduce that early because they don't have the concept).
