RocketLeague,ffg9q6w,t3_eta598,1579901498.0,"im about to throw some shade and get some hate. and it pains me to write this because i dedicated ~2000 hours into this game. i was hoping i'd eventually reach 5k and beyond in playtime, but my support for this game is falling as the years pass. for me, the last great update was years ago. dropshot introduced. changed the ranking system. something that SHAKES up rocket league as we know it but keeps the fundamentals the same - the playing experience and the physics.

there is so much potential in this game and year after year i've been hoping for many new and exciting changes, but i've been let down patch after patch. they've been, well to put it simply, boring and underwhelming. i hate comparing games, but i also play a shit load of dota. been play dota 2 since 2011 or 2012 whenever it was first released out of beta, and valve never ceases to excite the player base and drop some jaw-dropping patches that leave their community stunned. it keeps it fresh and exciting. the free to play model means anyone can join in the fun without any commitment, and they make more than enough money to be a profitable company. i truly feel that rocket league should mimic in how dota works. im not a creative person, im not a game developper. i cant say exactly how they should do this but there are professionals out there paid salaries to do this exact job - keep people entertained.

people have asked for updated training packs, we've all seen the post here dozens of times. it's fantastic! but it hasn't bee implemented into the game yet and it's been years. tournaments mode is busted. i don't want to get into the details of the game that are stale, but all i know is i need SUBSTANCE. i need something i can sink my teeth into and go, NOW THAT'S AN UPDATE! and get excited to run home from work, tell my wife i'm giving her 15 minutes of attention before i play rocket league for the remainder of the night.

games are capable to exciting their community, i know it. i've seen it. i've experienced it and dota 2 is not the only game i'm talking about. rocket league needs this. taking away a huge chunk of their player base is NOT the way to go. i run the game on pc, so i'm safe.... for now. 

aside from seasonal loot and the currency events they have (right now the red envelopes) what has psyonix done to actually shake things up and improve rocket league as we know it? rocket id? i honestly can't even think of one thing.

please, freshen your game up psyonix/epic. i know there are many of you who are still excited about the game and are reading this enraged at my comments, but as someone who's basically reached the top of the ranking system, i have nothing left to look forward to. like i mentioned before, i wish i could reach the 5000 hour mark, but since achieving the goal of reaching GC rank, what is my main inspiration to play the game now? grind through mmr and go from 1500 to 1600 to 1700? is that enough alone to keep me coming back when other games are CHANGING it up with big patches, and i'm getting excited to go play those games instead of the same old rocket league i've been playing for 2k hours?

again, i don't want the physics changed. i dont want regular ranked to change. it's perfect. theres no other game like it. its so damn unique, that NO OTHER GAME can prepare you for rocket league, no other game has any transferrable skills. like say i played CoD and i switched over to play csgo, well there are some transferrable skills there that i wont be complete dogshit at csgo. but with rocket league, every single person i know has to start at bronze 1 and grind their way up - because this game is one of a kind. and i applaud it for it. but the change im craving is different functionality and game modes and whatever the hell else other games do to excite their fan base.

im basically repeating myself at this point. this post is the longest post i've ever made. why? because i care about this game. and this is my humble opinion, dislike it if you want, i dont care. it's how i feel, and i've been a hardcore dedicated player for years. this game is slowly losing me as a player and it's sad. i went from playing hours per day to now playing hours per week. i feel the pull slipping. soon, maybe not this year, but perhaps next year, i know i'll be playing hours per month and maybe stop altogether and it'll become a distant fond memory in my life. i don't want this to happen! please keep me engaged psyonix, please!"

i have to point out though, ive been a soccer player all my life and that's where i get my stamina. but to compete in cross country, and it was one of the best races of the year, to win bronze was something special and i'm glad i went to that one.
