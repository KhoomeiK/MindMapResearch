wholesomememes,fg0u6wi,t3_ew3uka,1580415100.0,"I find it wholesome that they probably forget they’re good boys after a few minutes. But then you tell them they are again, and they get to experience the feeling of being the good boy all along once again."
creepyPMs,fg0s5ci,t1_fg032ik,1580413953.0,Definitely weird. But for me the weirder side is the people who are into that. It’s low key high key pedo.
creepyPMs,fg0rp7q,t1_fg0gi15,1580413704.0,A picture can say a thousand words. A message can paint a thousand pictures.
creepyPMs,fg0rbqx,t3_ew9yos,1580413492.0,They say politeness can open doors for you. Pretty sure that’s a metaphorical saying but this guy seemed to want to open the back door with it.

amiugly,ffw6old,t1_ffv2bx1,1580286841.0,"You’re definitely not overweight. However, something that could help bring out facial features and make you stand straighter and look nicer would be a regular workout. Coming from a 6’4 guy it really makes a difference. And moreover, a great reason to exercise is that it makes your self esteem skyrocket, it makes you feel healthier and more athletic, helps you sleep better, releases stress and anxiety, etc. As a person who’s struggled with all these issues, trust me when I say that a healthy lifestyle goes a long way. As of now you’re probably around a 6.5 but that could easily become a 9. Also being tall like we are is definitely helpful in catching a girls eye, but match that with a healthy body, a nice smile and a motivated, energetic and kind personality and you’ll have no issues finding someone. Best of luck!"
anime,ffq5xjl,t1_ffq4fja,1580122263.0,Hyouka has some of the best art I’ve seen in anime. Stunning design and animation.
sadcringe,ffq1uck,t1_ffq16t9,1580115759.0,"They can, in the same way that a person can potentially be reformed to be a good person. However a person’s action is a reflection of who they are. I don’t know if you’ve ever been cheated on, I have, and it’s a seriously traumatizing experience. Not only because of the betrayal and pain, but it has secondary effects like lowering your self esteem, and serious trust issues. I feel it’s universally understood that cheating is not okay. If you don’t want to be in a relationship, then break up. Can people learn from their mistakes? Sure they can! But it depends on the mistake. If you didn’t study enough during a semester and got shit grades, you can get your act together for the next one. Why? Because you’re the one who ended up being punished from your mistake, and in order to avoid it happening again you change. The cheater’s partner is the one who ends up being punished and reaping the Emotional and psychological consequences. You’d be surprised how little remorse cheaters have. For them it’s pretty much just a break up. So they usually don’t learn or change from their mistake since very often they don’t even see it as a mistake but as something they did that was justified. They have no incentive to change. The phrase “once a cheater always a cheater” is not-so-surprisingly very accurate."
sadcringe,ffpyzn2,t1_ffpynlk,1580111646.0,"True, however if a mistake were to happen intentionally, when severe enough, it can show the person’s qualities. Cheating is a selfish, treasonous and senseless act that can never be justified, without the justification making the cheater seem like a shit person. Therefore cheating doesn’t make you a bad person, BUT it shows that you were already a bad person."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffnbl84,t3_etrswi,1580064023.0,Hats off to you for the pun in the title
cringe,fedq919,t1_fect9hj,1579017540.0,"That’s just an asshole. Someone who’s “macho” is basically a guy who, by social standards, is seen as manly. Speaking confidently, standing tall, acting bravely, having knowledge about manly stuff like car or home repairs etc. The word means “male” in Spanish. Judging by the way this guy said “including....uuuummm....your daughter?” This guy is as far away from macho as you can get."
LongDistance,fe7feca,t1_fe6pp18,1578913884.0,"Actually did that with my gf before we met. We ordered the same pizza, identical toppings, and watched Captain Fantastic. Wasn’t a first date but it was fun."

MapPorn,fe31vfq,t1_fe2zmpz,1578845148.0,Honestly that makes sense. It’s one of the more alien looking areas in the original trilogy.
MapPorn,fe2g1nb,t1_fe2fs36,1578837982.0,Dagobah? No idea just a random jungle swamp guess.
depression,fe12366,t3_en5u2f,1578821633.0,"This guy is far beyond help. He’s a pedophile. I pray to god the only thing he’s done is have CP on his computer, though something tells me it’s not the case. The best thing for him now would be life in prison, far far away from any children. He deleted most posts from his account but he was on some subreddit asking or talking about kidnapping children or something. And he’s part of that messed up, bizarre and disturbing cult subreddit where people talk about dead women, how to get away with robbery, assault, murder etc, how to avoid being sent to a mental hospital. They even have special codes for each offense. This guy is a complete threat to society, to his wife and kids. Dude posted a creepy ass pic on that sub with some knife in it threatening his wife. He got what he deserved."
niceguys,fe0xvhy,t1_fe0931x,1578820037.0,What in the actual fuck. This place looks like some serial killer/rapist cult. Literally. How is it allowed on the site?
niceguys,fe0xfs9,t1_fdzbk24,1578819834.0,What even is that place? Nothing makes sense there. Seems twisted though.
relationship_advice,fe0w3y5,t3_en50h2,1578819372.0,"An ex-registered sex offender, in absolute denial, completely unable to see that he’s a sex offender. This points to some sociopathic shit right here. I seriously hope this is a troll post, otherwise that woman might be in actual danger. You should stay the hell away from her and get some professional help."
niceguys,fe0untk,t3_enj9ia,1578818852.0,Why do people think saying “I don’t mean to be rude/pervy/creepy/weird”somehow makes them not rude/pervy/creepy/weird? If anything it emphasizes that they are.

MapPorn,fdpzt74,t1_fdplcrq,1578647816.0,"I mean it does say Christmas public holidays, and I can see that Poland has both, so does Spain. Both days are national public holidays. Everything is closed. Nobody works."
MapPorn,fdp90wi,t3_em9x3i,1578622831.0,"Map is pretty incorrect. Spain celebrates both Christmas Day (25th) and the epiphany (6th at night we get a huge parade, morning of the 7th we open gifts from the 3 wise kings). 2 national holidays, families receive gifts from one or both holidays. In fact traditionally Christmas Day is LESS celebrated than the 3 kings day on the 7th of January. 
Source: I’m Spanish. 
I believe most catholic countries are the same, such as Poland (although they don’t receive gifts from the 3 wise kings, they do have a national holiday for the epiphany) 
Source: gf is polish."
amiugly,fdp7rdu,t1_fdp6o5q,1578621977.0,"True, but you implied that “most” good looking guys are assholes. Which is a very big generalization. My argument stands."
relationship_advice,fdp73zq,t3_embdb0,1578621544.0,My guy she didn’t even apologize she made EXCUSES first. You better lawyer up if you don’t want to keep getting played all your life. Unless you’re okay with your girl fucking other guys. In that case go have a blast.
amiugly,fdp5hc1,t1_fdomlfe,1578620455.0,"It honestly seems like by “good wife” this guy means “attractive wife”. Since that’s his reaction to being labeled as average looking. He seems to be aiming out of his league, because if he believed looks didn’t matter he’d go for a sweet, great, average looking girl in his league. Also not all good looking guys out there are assholes, in the same sense that not all good looking women are superficial and slutty. I don’t think it’s fair to make a huge general link like that between looks and personality."
whitepeoplegifs,fdp4p8r,t1_fdnwqdx,1578619933.0,Absolutely agree. I’m a very experienced skier and I never go out without a helmet. Slight discomfort or brain trauma. Hmmmm tough choice.
amiugly,fdku7ra,t1_fdknjfe,1578511250.0,"that is the single best compliment anyone could ever receive, after looking like regular shrek. Thank you."
TheMonkeysPaw,fdjtjem,t3_elrrfv,1578486979.0,"Granted. Nobody is capable of falling in love since people don’t fall in love with each other at the exact same moment, therefore it is always unrequited at least for some time. Love disappears from the world. Consequently so does the willingness to start a family with someone. Gradually the population dies off, being sustained only by accidental pregnancies which come from un-emotional sex. This results in devastating psychological issues in the young and drastically increased suicide rates. Society collapses. Humanity becomes extinct."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdje0qd,t1_fdjdm4y,1578466900.0,"I’m obviously not disregarding the fact that it’s a problem for a lot of gay people. But there are way larger groups of people who suffer, and this post seems a bit condescending to me. Poverty, race, abusive households, orphans, refugees, etc. They suffer too, and this post seems to isolate queer people. Nowadays, in the majority of cases, homosexuality is broadly accepted. And they’re over dramatic over things such as people calling them a faggot, sometimes asking for a little too much attention.

Edit: also, those people seem to have had an actual massive and incredibly brutal and disgusting occurrence. Everyone struggles to define themselves. Claiming that as queer people’s massive and most strenuous problem in life seems entitled to me."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdjckqo,t3_eliyq9,1578465346.0,"It’s a little bit of an exaggeration tbh. Playing the victim card. Many people, straight or not, have plenty of issues they resolve as they grow up. Claiming that being gay somehow makes life harder for you isn’t really right. Everyone has problems and difficulties. This seems to state that gay people are the only ones targeted snd humiliated in society."
LaCasaDePapel,fdi38bf,t1_fdhq8c8,1578434935.0,"I think there’s two reasons. He appreciates the art of it, as he mentions in a season 1 episode. But more importantly he’s always making them while negotiating. I think he uses it as a concentration tool, or a sort of concentration totem? In the same way Inspector Murillo always uses a pencil to make her hair into a bun before negotiating."
LongDistance,fdg47gu,t1_fdfwudj,1578379372.0,"It’s the one thing that FaceTime can’t provide - cuddling. So whenever I’m with her I make sure I’m always touching her (cuddling, hand holding, etc) since it’s the stuff I’ll miss the most."

LongDistance,fdg40nr,t1_fdeu9en,1578379168.0,"That’s exactly what I do. And now we’re counting down the days until summer, which is a bit easier than counting down to Christmas since our summer break is way longer. It’s great advice :)"
LongDistance,fdg3yd3,t1_fdewxkq,1578379101.0,I’m absolutely sure he feels the same way. I hope you get through the rough patch before you separate again. Hoping you two have a wonderful time too! And thank you :)
