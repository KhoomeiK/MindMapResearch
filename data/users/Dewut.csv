Like in what world does God (especially the one in the Bible, who can be a real prick) send himself down in the form of his son as a man to live amongst us and give peace and love instead of fire and brimstone a try for once, watch mankind persecute, mock, and *nail him to a cross* and then say “yep, that’s what you were supposed to do. Good job guys.”

In my mind, if God did ever exist, the crucification was when he officially threw in the towel and fucked off, probably to go try again somewhere else.

Not that it isn’t a major issue that still needs a lot more addressing than it currently gets, but it seems pretty disingenuous to try and paint with such a broad brush just to make a point.

LGBT people are, in the end, are just people. People who live various and complex different lives outside of just their sexual orientation or identity. Lives that some may decide, for whatever reason, to end for any number of things. Just like the rest of us.

Trying to pin their suicides purely on religious zeal is honestly even pretty disrespectful in my opinion. It’s as if you’re suggesting that without religious assholes, every LGBT person would all live happy, carefree lives and would never have any other reason to think about hurting themselves.

Additionally, you’re also handwaving away what are likely countless instances of years spent by people in incredible torment and pain, who eventually opted to just not have to do go through it anymore, as “the church did it” rather than the deep personal struggles they actually are.

politics,ffdtm6j,t1_ffdbmtl,1579828618.0,"I feel like this is good advice, but doesn’t really address what is really the biggest obstacle keeping young voters from turning up at the the polls, which is the fact that for most young people in the workforce Election Day is just another Tuesday.

Sure there are plenty of young potential voters out there who just don’t give a shit, but for a lot of them it simply comes down to not being able to miss work or even step out for an hour or so to vote, which is very much intentional as the people who are in the most dire situations where risking their job means risking everything are precisely the kind of people who those in power don’t want voting. 

If you’re trying to maintain your position what you want is people who can afford the luxury of being able to come to the polls, or just simply have enough free time in their day that’s it’s not even an inconvience. Those are the people you want casting ballots, you want the people that things are going well for and/or who are content, because those usually aren’t the type of people who are looking for change.

We can urge young voters the polls and try and assist as much as we like, and we should, but it’s not going to change the fact that we’re trying to win in a system that’s rigged against us. 

The fact that’s don’t have Election Day as a national/federal holiday, but instead have Presidents’ Day which not only is one, but typically occurs within several days of inauguration during election years is really just one big slap in the face to the American people. And on top of all that, there is the awful irony of it all, which is that the only way real way rectify this and other forms of systematic vote suppression is by electing those who do away with it."
marvelstudios,ffcyjsr,t1_ffcu8kd,1579809921.0,"Agreed, I feel like they decided to try and make an effort to seek out and incorporate some of the whackier stories and concepts from the Marvel comics (i.e. Planet Hulk), as well as taking a page out of The Guardians of the Galaxy playbook and leaning into the inherent silliness of it all and creating a film that’s fun, funny, and self-aware; which I really wish more of them would try and do, as I feel, besides maybe Ant-Man, Ragnarok and the GOTG films are the only Marvel movies that have really embraced their comic book origins.

marvelstudios,ffcfeyj,t1_ffc76ch,1579798292.0,"Right, other than being a solid look alike I thought he was miscast as Thor, at least as the way the character is in the comics, and the first two films really suffered as a result. I wouldn’t say they were “bad” persay, just kind of fell flat and were mostly forgettable (other than Loki); especially when compared to each phase’s other standout movies (Iron Man/Winter Solider). 

They did have some moments which stood out against the monotony though, however pretty much all of them are comedic ones that really have nothing to do with story which really should have been the first sign to the execs of what was and wasn’t working with the movies.

I really feel like there’s no better example of this than his introduction scene in the first Avenger’s movie when he’s first meeting Cap and Tony. Watching the latter two talk and go back and forth with each other only to be intercut with Thor’s weird Shakespearean way of talking is just so jarring and really paints a picture of what was wrong with the character and what needed to be changed."

I always considered the Thor films to be the weakest of the big three during phases one and two and am so glad the powers that be were able to recognize Hemsworth's natural comedic talent and not be afraid to take Thor in another direction by handing the third film over to Waititi, so that they could bring is what is probably the MCU's best standalone film."

AskReddit,ff7v97q,t1_ff7uske,1579659172.0,"That one was rough too, especially since it wasn’t even her “game”, that one asshole just yeeted her into them at full force.

The fact that she was working with Jigsaw does make it a little easier to stomach in retrospect though."
AskReddit,ff7v0ml,t1_ff7ufb0,1579659014.0,"Oh yeah, it’s basically that for the whole movie. 

The first Saw was pretty interesting though, much more psychological, and a lot different than the generic torture porn the series ended up becoming. Just two dudes chained in a room with a Saw looking for a way out."
AskReddit,ff7tkww,t1_ff7rtd3,1579658038.0,I think at that point in the movie they’re almost out of time to get the antidote for whatever it is that’s killing them and it’s a) starting to fuck them up and b) making them desperate. IIRC she doesn’t even watch (or listen?) to Jigsaw’s tape for her and just tosses it to the side before shoving her hands in.
Marvel,ff7t7y8,t1_ff74c2q,1579657783.0,"I really wish they’d do a miniseries or something about what Cap and the gang were up to between Civil and Infinity War. I feel like there could be some really interesting stories stemming from the idea of heroes on the run who are still dedicated to doing good, but have to operate outside the law and avoid being captured.

They could even do something similar to Star Wars: The Clone Wars and do it as a well done animated production, where it’s semi-anthological and made up of multiple small arcs that loosely connect.

Idk, just feels like a really untapped part of the MCU."
AskReddit,ff7s62i,t1_ff7qt9m,1579657052.0,"Maybe I’m not remembering all the details either, but I don’t understand why she had to put both hands in at all.

But god damn, that trap stuck with me more than any other in that movie. I’ve always been freaked out by wrists being cut to begin with, but what really got to me was the idea of her slowly getting weaker from the blood loss and no longer behind able to stand, so she eventually just has to hang by her wrists with all her weight bearing down on the razors, bleeding out.

aaaaaaaaaaaah"
meirl,ff7qeja,t1_ff7174n,1579655829.0,"I feel like it’s a holdover from when they used to use really low quality meat and lots of fillers, as well as the whole E. coli debacle a few years back, and has just becoming a running joke at this point. 

It also could have to do with what exactly people order. If you get one of their combos, or similar caliber food, that are actually pretty balanced then there’s no real issue; but if you just get a bunch of cheap random stuff like beefy five layers or loaded grillers, which are just filled with processed crap, then it makes sense that your body may not be able to handle it as well."
