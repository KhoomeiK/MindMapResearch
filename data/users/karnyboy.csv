warcraftlore,ffb3l4u,t3_eshmnr,1579750904.0,"The story feels like this: 

Legion was Metzens swan song. He was the last few keeping the original passion of Warcraft alive.  It released was epic, held nothing back and closed the burning legion arc ( not perfect, but it is what it is).

Then we got BfA lit up from the success of Legion, the story felt out of place for being so sudden after Legion. Multiple sources to consume the story so yiu knew what was going on. So convuluted.

Then instead it seems like the writers are cramming all the old lore in as fast as they can so they can move on to the next thing.  Like a total reset. At the cost of a huge disrespect to everything that built this world.
