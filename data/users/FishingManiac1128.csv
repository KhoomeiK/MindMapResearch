True movie. I watched it as a kid on VHS. I can't find it on IMDB, but I was able to find it via Google. https://youtu.be/fh84MPJ_YRY"
facepalm,feiuxo8,t1_feit1qy,1579147893.0,"Yes. To most people. But Trump has demonized the free press as ""out to get him"", i.e. ""fake news"", and there is a significant portion of the population that believe Fox News is the only source of ""real news"". You know, ""Fair and balanced"". To them, if Fox News didn't report it, it didn't happen."
facepalm,feisogh,t1_feirxu1,1579146200.0,"And I can't confirm this, but I'm fairly certain their only source of information is Fox News and GOP talking points. They repeat the exact same things McConnell and Graham say during verbal exchanges."

politics,fece929,t1_fecbdc5,1578971832.0,"I'm being sarcastic (somewhat) but to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised to learn Russia had assets in their campaigns to create chaos as necessary. Trump is too incompetent and self absorbed for that kind of foresight and planning."

worldpolitics,fdx08q8,t1_fdtju2y,1578764009.0,It wasn't directed at you. I have no way of knowing who downvotes. It was a general sarcastic response (note the /s) to being downvoted for some reason I don't understand. You're one of the good guys for answering my question and I appreciate it. Thank you.

Fishing,fd6lipj,t3_ek4rej,1578192764.0,"Congrats! I caught my first walleye on a Lindey rig and a nightcrawler. Was about the same size, but I was still excited. Be prepared for anything. Sometimes they want minnows on a jig, nightcrawlers on a Lindey rig, or a simple twister tail."
yesyesyesyesno,fd6g6kg,t3_ek19fd,1578190502.0,"I've launched my boat (18ft fiberglass fish & ski) by myself hundreds of times. As I was watching the video, it got to the point where I could see the boat start to float. I was yelling, ""Stop! You need to stop now! That's far enough! ..., oh man. You're screwed now."" And my wife immediately says, ""Are you on Reddit again?"" Having a rope guy is very helpful, but I usually fish by myself, so my ""rope guy"" is a knot tied to the trailer near the winch. After the boat floats off the trailer, I pull forward a little, untie the knot and tie the boat to the dock, park the trailer and walk back to the boat and off I go, unless I forget to put the plug in. ;-)"

Fishing,fc4h4gt,t3_eg5emg,1577416494.0,"I was actually fishing for yellow perch that day in late September, but only caught one small perch too small to take my slip bobber down. So, I left it on hoping to catch a nice walleye, but my float disappeared and started pulling drag. Since I only had 6lb mono I had the drag set pretty light. My brother in law started to reach for the net and said, let me know when you see your bobber again and went back to fishing. About 10 minutes of fight on my light rod."
