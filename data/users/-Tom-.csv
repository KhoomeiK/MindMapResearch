Justrolledintotheshop,ffebalw,t1_ffe6tzw,1579841978.0,"You can heat treat a block and have it be as strong if not stronger than casting. 

Think of it this way, a cast block is just randomly melted metal formed into place because it's melty. 

3D printing an engine block is equally melting the metal but you can control the direction of the grain growth. 

From there you can heat treat the block and relax the natural interjal stresses that built up during manufacture. From there you machine it like any other block. 

Fun stuff. 

It's just not economically viable for an engine block short of like...F1 or Top Fuel."

Basically some states (like Tennessee) don't have it recognize ""totaled"", ""salvaged"", or ""rebuilt"" titles in different distinct ways. Or even at all. So let's say your car gets damaged badly enough to get a salvage title in state X, your car cannot be registered and driven until it's inspected at which point it is issued a "" rebuilt""  title. Some states don't have those distinctions. So you could take a salvaged title car from state X, go register it in state Y and get a clean title.
