>These people — who range from C-list conservative bloggers to gluten-free bakers from Montreal, boat enthusiasts from Florida, and grocery-coupon collectors from North Carolina — claim to want #JusticeForJessica above all. Instead, they’ve terrorized her formerly sleepy hometown with their relentless demands for answers to their specious theories. In the process, they’ve spread rumors that have filtered into real life, igniting racial tensions, digging up old skeletons, and reawakening feuds. For these amateur detectives, Jessica’s death isn’t a mother's tragedy. It’s a pastime.

>Media critics use the phrase “missing white woman syndrome” to refer to the national obsession with victims who are young, blonde, and white, and Jessica checked all those boxes: The flaxen-haired former cheerleader weighed “90 pounds on a good day,” according to her mother. But the people who are fixated on Jessica’s death are exceptionally invested thanks to her tiny hometown. It’s easy for outsiders to track down social media accounts and even phone numbers for Jessica’s family members, friends, ex-boyfriends, and reputed enemies, all of whom said they’ve been contacted by strangers intent on cross-examining them about whether they killed a teenage girl.

>These killings were often linked to the alt-right, described as an outgrowth of the movement’s rise in the Trump era. But many of these suspected killers, from Atomwaffen thugs to the New Zealand mosque shooter to the Poway synagogue attacker, are more tightly connected to a newer and more radical white supremacist ideology, one that dismisses the alt-right as cowards unwilling to take matters into their own hands.

>It’s called “accelerationism,” and it rests on the idea that Western governments are irreparably corrupt. As a result, the best thing white supremacists can do is accelerate their demise by sowing chaos and creating political tension. Accelerationist ideas have been cited in mass shooters’ manifestos — explicitly, in the case of the New Zealand killer — and are frequently referenced in white supremacist web forums and chat rooms.

>Accelerationists reject any effort to seize political power through the ballot box, dismissing the alt-right’s attempts to engage in mass politics as pointless. If one votes, one should vote for the most extreme candidate, left or right, to intensify points of political and social conflict within Western societies. Their preferred tactic for heightening these contradictions, however, is not voting, but violence — attacking racial minorities and Jews as a way of bringing us closer to a race war, and using firearms to spark divisive fights over gun control. The ultimate goal is to collapse the government itself; they hope for a white-dominated future after that.

>Accelerationism has bizarre roots in academia. But as strange as the racist movement’s intellectual history may be, experts believe it has played a significant and under-appreciated role in the current wave of extremist violence.

>“It’s not an ideology that exists in a theoretical sense,” says Joanna Mendelson, a senior investigative researcher at the Anti-Defamation League. “It’s an ideology that has actually manifested in real-world violence.”

 plus its origins the article goes into Accelerationists refs podcast fav Crowley 

>The “we” he’s referring to is the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), a group of Warwick faculty members and graduate students who worked with Land to examine the questions that would come to define this early accelerationism. The writing that came out of CCRU’s work has a hallucinatory, ethereal quality that makes it hard to figure out exactly what they’re trying to say (Land’s marquee book is titled Fanged Noumena). It also feels very of its time; CCRU members obsessed over electronica and used the word “cyber” a lot, all conveying a sense of a society rapidly accelerating toward an exciting future.

>The CCRU was a fount of mad energy, obsessed with the pace of life under late capitalism; its members had utter disregard for traditional academic norms about scholarship and behavior. This could not last long. The CCRU split from Warwick in 1998, long after the university’s philosophy department had grown tired of its antics.

>According to Andy Beckett, a journalist who chronicled the CCRU’s rise and fall in the Guardian, Land and his remaining followers moved into a home in Leamington formerly owned by prominent British satanist Aleister Crowley, part of an obsession with the occult that had flourished in the accelerationist ranks. Beckett describes a psychologically tortured group that would scribble strange diagrams on the walls of Crowley’s former home. In Fanged Noumena, Land describes his “tool of choice” during his darkest period as “the sacred substance amphetamine ... after perhaps a year of fanatical abuse [I] was, by any reasonable standard, profoundly insane.”

>After the CCRU’s collapse, its members spread across British academia as well as fields ranging from journalism to music production. Its ideas rose to prominence again in the early 2010s, taking two separate, and opposed political turns.

>One was left-wing and academic, a school of Marxist thought focusing on how technology can be conscripted toward building a post-capitalist future. The other was right-wing, and in major part a product of Land’s mind.

and

>Land turned this admiration for technocratic strongmen into an entire political ideology. Linking up online with the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Curtis Yarvin — who writes under the pen name Mencius Moldbug — he helped construct the doctrine of “neoreaction,” or NRx, essentially an argument that democracy had outlived its usefulness. In his 2013 series of essays on the topic, titled The Dark Enlightenment, Land argues that the ideal state is a capitalist monarchy described as “gov-corp,” the state-controlled by an authoritarian CEO organizing policy according to the dictates of “rational corporate governance.”

>It was essentially a hard-right spin on accelerationism. Neoreactionaries argue that egalitarian and democratic policies described as “progressive” by left-liberals are, in fact, a way of slowing down the only progress worth having — acceleration toward techno-capitalist singularity. Neoreaction is a version of accelerationism adapted to address this problem.

>“Neoreaction is Accelerationism with a flat tire,” Land wrote in a 2013 blog post. “Beside the speed machine, or industrial capitalism, there is an ever more perfectly weighted decelerator ... comically, the fabrication of this braking mechanism is proclaimed as progress. It is the Great Work of the Left.”

>Though NRx has no mainstream proponents, it does have connections to prominent figures. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has reportedly read neoreactionary literature, and Trump-backing venture capitalist Peter Thiel’s fund supported Moldbug’s tech startup Urbit. In emails to right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos obtained by Buzzfeed, Moldbug claimed to be “coaching Thiel,” telling Yiannopoulos that he “watched the [2016] election at [Thiel’s] house ... He’s fully enlightened.”"

>But with nowhere to go, the bulk of the plastic waste - most of it from the UK, the US and Japan - just went somewhere else and that was to Malaysia.

>Plastic waste is typically recycled into pellets, which can then be used to manufacture other types of plastic.

>Not all plastic can be recycled, so legal recycling plants should send unrecyclable plastics to waste centres - something which costs money.

>""It also depends a lot on the types of plastics being burnt and the exposure to it. If you have short term exposure at a high level you might have difficulty breathing... [or it might] trigger some effects in your lungs. But if it's long term exposure... that's where the carcinogenic effects come in.""

>Evidence of real female sexuality is difficult to find in ancient Greek and Roman objects as they usually reflect male perspectives. In ancient Greece women were generally excluded from public life and politics, but they did take part in domestic and religious rituals. The poet Sappho (630–570 BC), who lived on the isle of Lesbos, gave a voice to women and female desire that has resonated throughout history. She is probably the seated figure on this water jar.  By the 19th century her poetry had made the word for an inhabitant of Lesbos a term for a woman who loves women. Little is known for certain about Sappho’s life but her poetry has been an inspiration to many women living in later eras.

Loki being fucked by a horse but getting a super-fast horse to gift to Odin out of it and other stories might be another play on the whole submissive vs dominant switch-a-roo when it comes to success.

HistoryMemes,ff5uooy,t1_ff5lt0q,1579610879.0,"they were okay with gay sex it was just 'you had to be the top' or 'more dominant one'. Age played a factor and led to abuse but in some cases, social class too was a whole power dynamic. So high society sleeping with their servants but no way would a servent ever be portrayed or be dominant openly (as far as we know) as in some cases even adult slaves were seen as boys or not part of manhood. Might be wrong but Hadrian had a mix of lovers in different age ranges but he tended to be socially more dominant. Most academics agree Hadrian was gay but his marriage was a political one to keep the line going, so high society had more pressure. though he did deify one of his lovers after their death. there's also a factor when it featured in art the people being portrayed don't want to look submissive to their lover either (the dominant ones usually have beards). however, as with nowadays, there were likely lots of rape and abuse of vulnerable and young but possibly less social shaming or wealthy got away with it more. 

Another issue is there's little on the history of gay relationships because most histories were recorded or studied in era when homosexuality was illegal. Only now is it being looked into more than the times it was in the past 

even in modern lgbt+ the whole 'top' vs 'bottom' or 'bear and otters' thing can have the same echoes of shaming in some circles but in others just preference thing. but then it gets complicated with power bottom dynamic

>Exoletus (pl. exoleti) is the past-participle form of the verb exolescere, which means ""to grow up"" or ""to grow old"".[102] The term denotes a male prostitute who services another sexually despite the fact that he himself is past his prime according to the ephebic tastes of Roman homoerotism.[103] Though adult men were expected to take on the role of ""penetrator"" in their love affairs, such a restriction did not apply to exoleti. In their texts, Pomponius and Juvenal both included characters who were adult male prostitutes and had as clients male citizens who sought their services so they could take a ""female"" role in bed

>Exoleti appear with certain frequency in Latin texts, both fictional and historical, unlike in Greek literature, suggesting perhaps that adult male-male sex was more common among the Romans than among the Greeks.[106] Ancient sources impute the love of, or the preference for, exoleti (using this or equivalent terms) to various figures of Roman history, such as the tribune Clodius,[107] the emperors Tiberius,[108] Galba,[109] Titus,[110] and Elagabalus,[111] besides other figures encountered in anecdotes, told by writers such as Tacitus, on more ordinary citizens.[

also, Russia approached a lot of far-right groups in the UK and Europe in 2009 like BNP after this most of those groups started repeating Russian foreign policy points. destabilizing EU is part of Russias/Putins thing and exploiting what's already there to do it http://www.riskandforecast.com/useruploads/files/pc_flash_report_russian_connection.pdf

>In 2009 Political Capital was among the first to point out Russia’s growing interest
in East European far-right parties. At the end of 2013 a number of analysts noticed a
similar development. This time around, Russia is involving itself with far-right parties
of Western Europe. 

>In other words, the gains from the trade-off for far right parties are not necessarily financial, as commonly assumed, but more valuable professional, organizational and media assistance; i.e., access to networks and political know-how. The effective use of such political know-how by Russia represents a risk for an emerging European pro-Russian party-network. Russia is clearly present on all fronts. Russia is simultaneously trying to assert its interests in the political mainstream and extremist parties alike, as well as venturing into a number of alternative scenarios. Tell-tale signs in Italy, Greece, and Hungary show parallels between one another’s far-right parties and Russian support. Meanwhile Russia continues to maintain its regular inter-governmental contacts.

>Russian influence may not only be effective due to its direct relations with specific parties, but also because these parties as of late, thanks to their resurgence, have become influential in their respective party families within the EU. In short, there is reason to believe that Russian diplomacy seeks to build party families in Europe. This is suggested by Russia’s policy for encouraging far-right parties to hold conferences with Russian assistance and to form alliances.

>• In November 2013 the head of the British National Party (BNP) Nick Griffin, the head of New Force, Roberto Fiore and the spokesperson for Greek Golden Dawn, Ilias P.

>Prime minister Theresa May is facing growing calls to respond to claims that her government has concealed evidence relating to Russian assassinations in Britain. In her six years as home secretary, she spearheaded the British government’s response to national security threats and presided over cuts of £2.3 billion from the national law enforcement budget that several senior officers have blamed for a drastic reduction in police capabilities. May personally intervened to delay the public inquiry into Litvinenko’s death, citing the need to protect “international relations” with Russia. And in the Perepilichnyy case, her government has withheld sensitive evidence from the inquest on “national security” grounds.

>The core reason British authorities have turned a blind eye, a current senior national security adviser to the British government told BuzzFeed News, is fear. Ministers, he said, were not prepared to take the “political risk of dealing firmly and effectively in whatever way with the activities of the Russian state and Russian-organised crime in the UK” because the Kremlin could inflict massive harm on Britain by unleashing cyberattacks, destabilising the economy, or mobilising elements of Britain’s large Russian population to “cause disruption”. Deep law enforcement funding cuts mean “our capabilities are very weak”, he said. It was also impossible to rule out the risk of “general war with Russia” in the current climate, he said, and “if it were to happen it would happen very, very rapidly, and we would be entirely unprepared”. As a result, he concluded, ministers “desperately don’t want to antagonise the Russians” and senior figures in government had told him bluntly that there was “no political appetite to deal with the Russian Federation”.

>A senior US intelligence official, who is still serving and cannot be named, told BuzzFeed News that the British have “downplayed involvement of Russians on their soil for years”. Reflecting the views of several sources, he added: “The Brits made a deal years ago that the Russians could come in and spend money on housing and stimulate the economy and they’ll look the other way.”"

>She says she was only 19 when she was first propositioned, with an offer of £20,000 for dinner and drinks.

>But after starring in series two of Love Island, an agency emailed, offering her £50,000 for five nights in Dubai. It contained a non-disclosure agreement, stating that the details of what she would be required to do would remain confidential.

>Tyne-Lexy says she refused the offer, but fears that struggling influencers who do not receive luxury items for free would feel pressure to ""keep up appearances"" and become vulnerable to these kinds of transactions.

>""It's a lot of money for some people, it's life-changing amounts of money.""

>This programme has seen several messages which influencers have received. The approaches vary from men directly suggesting sex, to agents acting on behalf of a wealthy client.

>We received anonymous written evidence from a person claiming to be a British reality star, who said she had been offered £10,000 for sex as part of a holiday package.
""Isabel"" said she was first approached on Instagram by a man 10 years older than her, after she had competed in a TV talent show.
""I was initially offered designer handbags. He had a fetish for being financially dominant so he would get a sexual kick out of spending hundreds and hundreds of pounds on bags for me,"" she explained. ""I would also struggle to keep my followers engaged online. So I guess that's why I accepted the offer. ""

>She said they did not meet for 18 months and spoke every day, so she was excited to meet him.

>""He was really pleasant when I was there. At dinner we started drinking and he was asking about my finances - I explained I was in £5,000 of debt. He said: 'Have sex with me and I'll give you double that'.""

>""Isabel"" said she went up to his hotel room and went through with it. ""I felt a kind of a mixture of degraded, really annoyed at myself, violated.""

>But she insists it is not a form of prostitution: ""It is a targeted relationship that progresses over time... Whereas I think prostitution is when you agree a fee with a stranger.""

>Heather Brunskell-Evans said: ""The women who are involved with this will not want to hear the word prostitution. The reality is that they are selling their bodies for money.
""The groomers are offering the woman everything she needs to be a success at her job as an influencer, but ultimately it's exploitation, and that woman will have to do things for that money that she doesn't want to associate herself with, that make her feel shamed.""

>The earliest usage of the white dragon as a symbol of the Anglo-Saxons is found in the Historia Brittonum. The relevant story takes place at Dinas Emrys when Vortigern tries to build a castle there. Every night, unseen forces demolish the castle walls and foundations. Vortigern consults his advisers, who tell him to find a boy with no natural father, and to sacrifice him. Vortigern finds such a boy, but on hearing that he is to be put to death to solve the demolishing of the walls, the boy dismisses the knowledge of the advisors. The boy tells the king of the two dragons. Vortigern excavates the hill, freeing the dragons. They continue their fight and the red dragon finally defeats the white dragon. The boy tells Vortigern that the white dragon symbolises the Saxons and that the red dragon symbolises the people of Vortigern.

>The story is repeated in Geoffrey of Monmouth's fictional History of the Kings of Britain (c. 1136). In this telling the boy is identified as the young Merlin. The Historia Brittonum and History of the Kings of Britain are the only medieval texts to use the white dragon as a symbol of the English.

>A similar story of white and red dragons fighting is found in the mediaeval romance Lludd and Llefelys, although in this case the dragons are not used to symbolize Britons or Saxons. The battle between the two dragons is the second plague to strike the Island of Britain, as the White Dragon would strive to overcome the Red Dragon, making the Red cry out a fearful shriek which was heard over every Brythonic hearth. This shriek went through people's hearts, scaring them so much that the men lost their hue and their strength, women lost their children, young men and the maidens lost their senses, and all the animals and trees and the earth and the waters were left barren. Lludd finally eradicated the plague by catching the dragons and burying both of them in a rock pit at Dinas Emrys in Snowdonia, north Wales, the securest place in Britain at that time. He captured the dragons by digging a pit under the exact point where the dragons would fall down exhausted after fighting. This place was at Oxford, which Lludd found to be the exact centre of the island when he measured the island of Britain. The pit had a satin covering over it and a cauldron of mead in it at the bottom. First, the dragons fought by the pit in the form of terrific animals. Then they began to fight in the air over the pit in the form of dragons. Then, exhausted with the fighting, they fell down on the pit in the form of pigs and sank into the pit, drawing the satin covering under them into the cauldron at the bottom of the pit, whereupon they drank the mead and fell asleep. The dragons were then wrapped up in the satin covering and placed in the pit to be buried at Dinas Emry [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dragon)"
