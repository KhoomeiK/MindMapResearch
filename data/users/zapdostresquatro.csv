The rescue had to be put down a year and a half later because he had a lot of health problems and was really old (the vet who put him down said she thought he was 17 or 18, but we don’t know his exact age cause he was just left in front of a vet’s office), but god he was the sweetest thing while we had him, and as much as it hurt to lose him so soon after getting him, I would absolutely do it again. I strongly recommend rescuing an older dog!"

Fortunately just one nip and then he’d be done, but when we took them (2 litter mates, one likes people and is afraid of dogs, his brother was afraid of people and so would bite but loved other dogs) on walks, we’d always have to tell the kids “you can pet the one in the blue harness, but the one in the red harness bites, don’t try to pet him!”"

aww,feaa0qs,t1_fea91wh,1578946132.0,"That’s the general rule of thumb aging, but dogs age more slowly after they reach physical maturity, and it also varies by breed (the oldest bichon frise was something like 25 years old I think? Mine is currently 16 1/2 and only recently stopped acting like a puppy cx ). They’re physically mature at about 2-3 (we were told 3 for our bichons), so they age quickly during that time."
