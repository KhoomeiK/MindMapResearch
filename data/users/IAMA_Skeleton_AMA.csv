Of course I don’t get winded climbing a few sets of stairs, so I got that going for me! XD"
fatlogic,fdf0zcs,t1_fdf09ds,1578350853.0,Boo-urns. I wonder if you can still watch the old episodes on the Slice page. I used to stream re-runs of this show because I loved it so much!
fatlogic,fdezvgr,t1_fdest0a,1578350157.0,I used to LOVE X-Weighted. 6 months of sensible diet and exercise plans and some of the results were astonishing (although there were a few failure). I wish they still made that show; I really enjoyed it!
fatlogic,f8v1f7d,t1_f8unf0u,1574855513.0,"Totally agree. I’ve had three kids, and three different recovery experiences afterward. My third was literally so easy I checked myself out of the hospital about an hour afterward and was feeling great.

My first, however, was awful. Lots of tearing, hemorrhaging after delivery, major blood loss, PPA. I couldn’t poop without pain for months. I didn’t feel back to my normal self for six months. I was severely sleep deprived and suffering both mentally and physically. The last thing I needed to do was think about “getting my body back”.  If someone had tried telling me DiEt AnD ExErCiSe WiLl MaKe YoU FeEl BeTtEr I would have likely lost it. There is a time and a place, and sometimes you need to let a lady with a baby accept that just surviving and having a body with a gross deflated abdomen is normal and ok. 

(I still feel some trauma after 8.5 years. Those were dark days for me.)

I mean, I still have long term effects from having kids. My hips are seriously messed up and I have to attend physio to help strengthen them and I have stress incontinence. This limits the kinds and amounts of exercise I can do without causing injury. Having kids is no joke, man. 

That being said, I made a serious effort to take the weight off after number 3, and get into reasonable shape. It was easier to calorie count than to exercise so I focused on that and added in exercise once I had the time. :)"
