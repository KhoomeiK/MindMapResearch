This is incorrect. Read the fourteenth amendment.

But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, **except for participation in rebellion, or other crime,** the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.""

States are constitutionally allowed to restrict the voting rights of people who have committed crimes as they see fit.

2) I don't think they will. If this latest incident has shown anything it's that they aren't willing to escalate to a suicidal extent.

3) I doubt their allies would have a moral issue with Iran getting a nuclear weapon. I also think Israel would have to respond to any Iranian bomb by formally announcing their nuclear armament, so if there is any moral issue it will be sidelined.

4) Israel has ballistic missile submarines, essentially a guaranteed second strike capability. Iran has no realistic ability to attack Israel with nuclear weapons without suffering their own annihilation.

5) I think this is unlikely. If Iran gets the bomb and then one goes off in Tel Aviv, it's going to be obvious who's responsible even without the analysis that could point out the source and Iran would be annihilated.
