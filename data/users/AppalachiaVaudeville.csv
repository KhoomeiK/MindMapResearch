I've worked Roadside Assistance Dispatch for the 2 biggest Car Rental companies in America. We do not have GPS trackers on the cars. 

Everybody calls into Roadside Assistance thinking that the company can track the vehicle.

I've had multiple people who had their rental car stolen who called in yelling at me to locate their rental via GPS.

breakingmom,feialpd,t3_ep7dbu,1579134025.0,"I left the babycenter community because of the same reason basically.

Their lust to shame other women is palpable. Every thread is grown adults gleefully ripping into whomever parented in a less than perfect way.

I had a mom friend group irl that I put together. I stopped talking to them when they all started being competitive and shitty towards one another.

I don't dislike other moms individually, but I absolutely have been burned too many times to ever join another ""mom group""."
personalfinance,fei40r4,t3_ep6pyk,1579129795.0,"I was in primo shape when I had my oldest kid. I had amazing health insurance through my job. I went with a midwife and a water birth. In total it costed me about $2200usd out of pocket for the entire pregnancy: vitamins, prenatal appointments, labor & delivery, a post delivery massage, lactation consultation, and 3 post birth mother + baby checkups. I had zero complications and it was a fun experience. Not one I'd do again, but I remember the experience fondly.

My second pregnancy was 5 years later and it was twins. We did not anticipate twins. I got fired when I was 6 months along and lost my insurance, so we qualified for medicaid. Our twins were monochorionic, which is high risk because it means the babies shared a placenta. Thank christ they were born during Obamacare because we had 2-3 appointments per week with specialists **just to monitor the growth of the twins.** Then extra appointments for things like steroid shots, pregnancy specific immunizations, and blood work. 

That doesn't mention the hospital stay when they had to induce me prematurely. Or the extra pediatric visits we had to do the first two months because the twins struggled to eat/gain weight. They had to be on special formula for preemies that was $20 per can and they went through 1.5 cans a day, thankfully WIC helped cover most of that.

I love my twins, but even with assistance from the state they have almost bankrupted us. We can not afford even part time daycare. I freelance, we have worked opposite shifts, my husbands current income rose to 80% of what our combined income was when I was the breadwinner. We are still financially devastated.

But we make it, somehow. We are crawling our way back out, but it's tentative.

My point is, there's no way to handle the cost before you know what it's going to be. You don't know that you will have a standard, uncomplicated pregnancy with a standard uncomplicated infant. Save as much as you can and try to build up as much pto as you can, but know that it can still go either way. 

I've met multiple women who went back to work days after giving birth because their baby had to be in NICU. I've met a lot of parents like us that can not afford child care and don't have family to help. I've met many women who labor as long as they possibly can at home so they don't have to pay as much for the delivery. You just do the hardest shit you can imagine for the people you love just to get by, that's pretty much what parenthood is until the kids are grown."

I do my hair the way I like it, I style it to keep it healthy. I wear clothes that make me feel empowered. I wear these shoes because I think they are dope. I exercise and eat well for My health, not for male attention. Entitled Men, none of this effort is for you. I want to feel beautiful to ME."

AskWomen,fehim0x,t3_ep2ojr,1579117292.0,"My partner grinds his teeth in his sleep.

It is the most excruciating noise to hear. It's distressing because it sounds so painful.

Most nights I just gently scratch the top of his head or rub his back until he stops. But some nights it's just an all night thing and there isn't much I can do but be grateful for him and sympathetic for how bad his jaw is going to hurt in the morning.

I've had salty nights where I shake him awake, but that was only after he'd done it for months on end without relenting(bad work situation, I think the grinding is stress induced). In the end it just do him any good to be woken up."
women,fehg76d,t3_ep3g5j,1579115881.0,"Could you volunteer to hold NICU babies at your local hospital?

When my kids get older I'm going to garden. It's something complex to nurture and I won't go to jail if it dies.

Or I'm thinking of building tiny houses. I can get the thrill of dressing something up while being resourceful. I'm thinking I want to buy land and build tiny houses for my kids to have when they become adults.

Either way, after twins I can Not mentally handle another baby, plus once you've had twins you chances of having a second set go way up. Twins newborn phase convinced me for life that my uterus is a fucking liar.

My Uterus: Remember that baby head smell?

Me: Remember that time you let the zygote split into two damn kids OUT OF NOWHERE?!"
