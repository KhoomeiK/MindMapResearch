IncelsWithoutHate,fczqm55,t1_fcx6ss7,1578106905.0,"You're kind of being an idiot here. It's not fucking cognitive dissonance. Clearly I mean that looks are the base thing, there's a threshold they have to cross. I am not going to date an unattractive person with a super great personality or an attractive person with a shit personality. You have to have a good amount of looks and personality, even if you weigh differently in each- one can make up for the other, but only to an extent. When I said I would date him depending on his personality, I meant he was attractive enough for me to consider him, and think about his personality as the final factor. Get it? It's like a two stage selection. Anyway, I don't care if those other things I included in personality aren't actually personality. They're what I consider besides looks, so I've lumped them in with personality."

No. It's not. If you wanna stick your head in the sand and keep saying that what is true is just what you've been thinking is true, okay. But you're wrong.

I would never date anyone I found to be unattractive. That's the truth. I've seen 3 incels from this subreddit, two I found unattractive, but one I found pretty attractive. I would date him depending on his personality. And personality incorporates a lot of things besides just basic personality traits. It also includes interests, political beliefs, and humor. There was this super cool leftist guy I was following. He showed his face once, and it was average, but I really admired him and his activism, and would have dated him.

For example, Elliot Rodgers. He couldn't get any girls. That wasn't because of his looks. He was attractive. It was because he was super demanding, and probably creepy as hell too."

What women consider ugly is not average. This is a really stupid idea being passed around here to comfort yourselves. I consider a large number of men to be attractive.

It's calling someone ""a white"" instead of a white person, ""a black"" instead of a black person, and so on. You're ignoring the fact that we are female humans, not just females. It's one step behind calling us femoids. Female before a noun is fine, but by itself? Women hate this. I haven't met a single women who is fine with being called a female.
