worldnews,fgkby78,t1_fgkbrbv,1580862008.0,"I am not. And I don't disagree that they are responsible and accountable. All I'm saying is,it's easy to blame and point fingers but we also need to stay vigilant and educated about it psychologically because we don't want to let fear and hatred dictate our actions during adversities."
worldnews,fgkahmk,t1_fgk3779,1580861052.0,The Chinese government is what you should focus your dislike on. Chinese people (even those who might appear unruly) are the unfortunate byproduct of the brainwash and poor social education.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fgk8jpz,t1_fgjiqx7,1580859803.0,How backward are we as a society now that we create gifs and put captions in from a video originally have audio?
nba,fgk5xfo,t1_fgispai,1580858176.0,"Especially when your whole defense is that the guy is a winner hence it's okay that he plays the primadonna role. How out-of-touch do you have to be?   


Just because you won championships, doesn't mean you are now above everyone else as a player or human being. I know he's probably just rushing to his friend's defense but this is no excuse."

kings,fghn5t8,t3_eygw9g,1580788679.0,To say we have hole(s) to fill would mean that we are close to contention. We are not. So your assessment is 100% correct imo.

nba,fg2n2a2,t3_ewgdh4,1580448605.0,Too bad the majority of fans vote based on stardom. Playing fantastic basketball never was that high on the priority list.
kings,fg1elvv,t1_fg1e0t9,1580425726.0,"Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but it's usually let known to the public what kind of injury the player suffers, and for how long will they expect said player to be out of commission. The only reason one would not be transparent about something like this, imo, are, A: They are not sure (which implies more tests will be done to evaluate); or B: They don't want the public to know (for whatever reason). I can't think of any other reason why you'd not let us know the extent of an injury."
kings,fg13r8d,t3_ewbjdi,1580420168.0,"While I love her and her wholehearted support of us, this has to be one of the weirdest and unprofessional things about this dumpster fire that is the Kings' organization. Why can't we be transparent about our players' injuries?"
bmpcc,fg0qwmz,t3_ewat2w,1580413263.0,"I have not personally used that brand but I have tried both the Smallrig and the Tilta cage.

swtor,ffpsrz8,t3_euhm9b,1580104369.0,"Came back to the game after leaving FFXIV (just wasn't enjoying enough of the AOE dances but I digress), to me, this is such a great palate cleanser after Disney ruined the movie franchise for me. So many things had changed since I played last time and I'm slowly learning how things work but I'm having a great time."

kings,ffa7hmr,t1_ffa6qj7,1579729379.0,"Yeah but ultimately it falls on you for picking this particular Mickey D to begin with. You know this joint is brand new and doesn't have any experience making Big Mac. If one is truly intended to get the best Big Mac possible, one would go to the store that knows the construct of a Big Mac and had made such burger before, you won't go listen to you buddy and just blindly support his cousin who never actually even cooked before and his real experience was getting close to seeing the making of a good one. 

Wait... What are we talking about again?"
kings,ffa34n8,t3_eshi6u,1579726935.0,Getting mad at Marvin Bagley is like getting mad at a McDonald's employee for the price of a Big Mac.

He just needs to step up a notch and be consistent, which in the current state with Walton's ""strategy"" and the influx of players' injury, makes it more than a necessity for Barnes to do so."

That is a once-in-a-lifetime talent. It is this generation's LeBron James. And we didn't pick him when we had the chance.

That's what broke my Kings fandom permanently.
