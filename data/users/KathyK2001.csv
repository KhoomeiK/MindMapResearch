BeautyDiagrams,feibfke,t3_ep4usz,1579134578.0,I really liked the natural light. It brings out your color and beauty and colors look truer.  The warm light dims your coloring but gives a nice glow for photos. The blue light is not flattering for tutorials because it gives a blue tone to every color.
MakeupAddiction,feiaii2,t3_ep3cqx,1579133966.0,Very beautiful! I love those colors on you!

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fd3367t,t3_ejxo78,1578154349.0,This year I am looking forward to (and hoping he doesn't change his mind) my son possibly moving back home.  We are 2 thousand miles apart. I haven't seen him in two and a half years.  It will be nice not to be alone all the time.  Also Friday I am having surgery to hopefully clear up my watery eyes which has really been frustrating! It's a three months process with tubes in my tear ducts but I can see light at the end of the tunnel and makeup that doesn't run! Lol
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fd321eg,t1_fd30a4h,1578153993.0,I feel your frustration.  I have gotten where I hate to leave the house.

beauty,fcz9jw2,t3_ejjic6,1578096419.0,Go for walks. Start small and work up. Get into nature if you can. It works wonders on your depression and your weight! I know from experience.  Good luck and happy healing. Take care.
Christianity,fcyzswc,t3_ejjpb6,1578090729.0,That's awesome!
Ulta,fcyz2du,t3_ejje0k,1578090256.0,"When I got mine, it had obviously been opened but I did get it."
trichotillomania,fcyyvp9,t3_ejaw2q,1578090135.0,"Yes that is a normal feeling. Because you are trying so hard not to pull, your body is very tense. One thing I noticed  when I was quitting was that my jaw was clenched so I relaxed my mouth and jaw which relieved the tension.  Your head will tingle and itch but it will pass. Focus on the future of what its like to not pull. It helps."
beauty,fcvz3td,t3_eiz7ie,1578013395.0,I have been using bkr lip balm and that stuff is amazing. My lips have not even flaked since I been using it.  They are softer too. I am a smoker and have always had flaky chapped lips.  I just use it at night before I go to bed.  I also don't find myself reaching for my lip balms all the time.
beauty,fcsikx9,t1_fcsi3xk,1577917190.0,I use it as a stand alone.  I have been using a makeup remover cloth and then a cleanser but the balm works so well I don't have to. I massage it in for a minute then rinse.

beauty,fcri7k3,t3_eiice8,1577902150.0,I have just started using Banilla's clean zero balm. Its amazing! It completely cleans all makeup off including my tubing mascara. It also leaves my face very soft and silky.  I highly recommend. It's $19.00.
MakeupAddiction,fbz1n9h,t3_eertja,1577232385.0,Nice! Beautiful look to brighten the winter blues.
