TrueOffMyChest,ff8m7ld,t1_ff7wguu,1579685438.0,"It's right in the OP ""I keep seeing this shit online"" They just hear about trans people from their corner of the internet without having ever even talked to someone trans and get all these warped ideas. Instead of you know asking for information about why someone might choose their pronouns they post this crap."
TrueOffMyChest,ff8cexf,t3_es5lsh,1579672813.0,"Dude I've noticed it with everything... not just movie opinions, it's everything.

I have a roommate who is obsessed with alt right internet culture... like fully obsessed. Dude could have a job in the future as a historian for the internet because he studies and immerses himself in his free time.

Another roommate of mine just consumes media all the time, tv shows, movies, books, music, memes, etc... But every opinion he has on this stuff is from reviewers. Like if we're watching a movie and I pull up a review on my phone, it's the exact same info that he tells me.

Occasionally it makes me feel like I'm going fucking insane because people around me are in their own worlds while I'm just stuck here because that's how my brain works. 

My favorite movies are all pretty much psychological horror or documentaries because that's what I enjoy, Jacob's ladder, We need to talk about kevin, Jarhead, etc. I need to really think to enjoy a movie. Personally I don't enjoy the newer star wars movies because it's always the same plot as the original trilogy. Same reason I don't like marvel movies, ""the world is ending and we have to get the plot device to stop it""... Maybe I just have a mild response in my endorphins to good guys kicking the bad guy's ass, or maybe nobody really likes those movies and just go because everyone else does. I don't even know."

GenjiMains,ff806jr,t1_ff7ojnp,1579662578.0,It felt like I had this like map in my head of overwatch like in a 3d space and I was not aiming.. I was looking. It just made it super easy to pull off what I normally would have thought were suicidal engages.
OverwatchUniversity,ff6ei6o,t3_erhzmf,1579625451.0,"Personally for console aim settings I like to go linear ramp with full  aim assist on the lowest sensitivity that I can still do 180 turns by just flicking the stick all the way to the side.

The issue is that the deadzone in the center of the stick makes small aim changes nearly impossible without super low sensitivity which is what aim assist really helps with. For sniping or playing tank you might want to turn aim assist off entirely, but I find that it's helpful especially with heroes you are constantly shifting your perspective with like tracer."
OverwatchUniversity,ff6ajhl,t3_err5h7,1579622950.0,"With reinhardt there are different phases of the game you need to play differently. Generally always you want to kind of be in pattern of a holding shield, scouting, going for swings, and baiting the enemy into engaging at a choke point, OR simply full aggression, it's kind of like a switch on your behavior. 

At the start of the game nobody has ultimates to stop you or punish you so you can play a lot more aggressive, take some damage so your healers get ult charge, get a few swings in and maybe a charge kill. Then as people get ults you really want to start saving your cooldowns to combo with other ults or shutdown ults and punish enemy positioning. Try to combo your charging an enemy reinhardt at the same time your mcree uses high noon or keeping track of reaper to so you have your charge on cooldown when he ults, or to chase down enemies. 
Then there's when you have a shatter. Usually you want to do a bit of a set play with your teammates, charging through the enemy team while zarya bubbled and nanoboosted into a 180 shatter is personally one of my favorite engages, but if you don't have any support ults you sometimes need to save it and use it to shutdown a big threat. Sometimes I hold shield after I shatter and let my team mop up safely, sometimes I go in to secure kills. 

Also vs enemy reinhardts it becomes a bit of a chess match, make sure you don't get baited, always block shatter and anticipate the counter-shatter.

With winston you need to understand what his bubble is used for. First off it's protection from cooldowns and stuns and damage. You want to dance around a bit with your bubble and your enemy keeping them on the other side of it. Secondly it cuts off healing. Winston has low damage so you might have to use your bubble to isolate enemies your fighting from their healers and by dropping a bubble as you engage their healers you can stop them from healing their team in order for the rest of your team to secure kills. 

With winston generally when you engage you get into a position first, above the enemy team or around a corner and laser as long as you can, bubble yourself and use jump to escape or finish off an enemy. Then there's jump engages, usually you can jump engage an isolated support, sniper, or flanker with their cooldowns off. Jump in, start tasering, throw down bubble, and melee to finish them off. Next is diving with your team, it's basically just focus firing and finishing off enemies fast by bursting them down. You jump into the enemy team at the same time as your genji, tracer, dva, wrecking ball, doomfist, etc. and just focus firing will kill real fast. Lastly is peeling for your team. It's kind of like playing firefighter winston, when your team is a bit split and you jump in on anyone attacking your teammates. 

Primal rage is mostly a second life, you can stay in and turn around a situation that you would have had to retreat from or die. Ideally enemies will be low from you jumping in and tasering so one or two hits from primal will finish them off, then you can escape or just keep fighting depending on the situation. You can generally kill an enemy if you push them up against a wall, off the map, or if they're stuck in a gravitron surge, but even I find the mechanics of primal rage to be tricky, it's hard to secure kills against heroes with escapes or one that's being pocketed by a healer so try to prioritize enemies that are more vulnerable. Then there's more strategic primals like knocking enemies in a fortified position off high ground for your team to pick off, stalling, or keeping the enemy off the objective in overtime. 

Winston has a lot of places on specific maps and team comps that he's really good, so experiment with different positioning and different engages till you figure it out.

The trouble you might run into while tanking is that a lot of teammates don't quite get winston and reinhardt as a character in general, or at least your specific playstyle, so you should get creative and communicate your plans and what assistance you need to be effective so your teammates know what to do. For example I learned reinhardt playing with a group of guys who always spawncamped, we didn't even need to say anything because we just knew, always chase down and stagger. Then I started playing solo and fed my ass off till I started communicating and letting people know, I'm going in, you guys better follow me."
college,fea19uo,t3_eo8ga9,1578943282.0,"Honestly it starts with your sleep schedule, go to bed earlier and when you wake up throw on a pot of coffee, get cleaned up, eat some food, and have about an hour of free time to work on assignments or work out or something before you have to leave for class.

It's actually really fucking nice taking things slow in the morning instead of being rushed."

college,fddoes3,t1_fddnfc5,1578319506.0,"That's the way it is sometimes, sucks to be taken advantage of especially when you're already struggling. Hopefully you get this thing sorted out."
college,fddmzmu,t3_ekfbwy,1578318241.0,"I wouldn't. In my experience people are more likely to look down on you or try to take advantage of you once they find out you're homeless and very few people will actually give meaningful assistance unless it's their job. Talk to the housing or financial department at your college, not someone who has authority over you like a prof.

Really you shouldn't have spent your savings on a class. There are for sure financial aid options that would have covered you, probably too late now but you should look for those in the future."
gwent,f8qyc99,t3_e1lact,1574727290.0,I haven't played since the first week of new gwent but I used to get major ranked anxiety. Especially up around rank 4000-4200 pushing for gm I would literally take smoke breaks between each game lol.
