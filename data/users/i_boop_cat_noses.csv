I had to unlearn trying to defend them and come to light with how many things they stripped me from just to start healing. Humans are intricate and the smallest things can affect us for decades to come. Please be patient. A bad childhood leads to defected socialisation, habits and emotional distress, and that is hard to cope with, despite their family not beating or physically abusing them. Yes, everyone should try, yes, there are people who use that as a cruth for not trying for the better. But please keep in mind that there are always more abused people out there than who admits to being abused."

criticalrole,fdlyjd1,t3_elvqzw,1578535556.0,"For everyone debating if Nott would stay a goblin, I highly doubt it. In Exandria if my memory server right goblins only live up to being around 20 years old (Zorth was said to be around that and he was really really old).

With her being turned to everything ""she's not"", or at least how she perceived herself, she actually started living the mirror image of who she thpught she was, and this starts to show her what she had, who she really is and also opens doors from being something more than a housewife and assistant."

For Scanlan pile on dying twice, your last wishes being crossed, promises broken, body desecrated and infantilised, nearing an addiction, and its just an emotional mess of what Scanlan felt at that moment.

People are stupid and dangerous, as your crime statistics show so leaving these devices in the hands of the most trained people who are to upkeep the law is logical. That's why it's fucking safe to live in Europe, or at least definitely more safe than in the US. Extreme situations always happen, especially if they cant get into close range with a suspect, that's why they have them, but since here its unlikely for a cop to get shot at, they are not trigger happy either."
