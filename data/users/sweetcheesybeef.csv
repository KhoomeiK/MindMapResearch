Either people have absolutely no idea about fetal development or they are intentionally dehumanizing the fetus/baby. If I had to guess the babies in this picture are probably less than 20 weeks, maybe 15? I could be wrong but that's my guess. Many, many people would call them a clump of cells and joke about squishing them or whatever. It's disgusting heartless behavior."

I first heard about this in 2014 from a NICU nurse when my middle son was born a month early. He's fine and everything but talking to them and learning about how early these preemies come just touched my heart. I also had a nephew born at 32 weeks. And with my youngest I started having contractions at 25 weeks although she stayed in until 37 weeks. Anyway, in my eyes what your girlfriend and others like her are doing is incredible and amazing and just so important. I can only imagine the ethical concerns that go along with this.

Just talk with your doctor about what is safe and your long term plans and you should be good. Also, make sure you stay on it and voice any new problems to your doc and your support group. I've always taken the pragmatic approach to my mental health. Just like I didn't hesitate to get my eyes rechecked when my prescription changed I don't hesitate to talk with my doc when my mental health changes needed addressed. Also, your anxiety and depression can change a bit as different hormones take charge. So for me it was a out mid way through my pregnancy, shortly after the birth,  and about 6-8 months in, and again when I weaned after nursing for a year. It sucks, just stay on it don't be afraid to ask for help. More moms deal with this than you'd ever know. I personally am sick of the fake facade of pregnancy and motherhood  being this perfect, amazing time. It's not. It's hard. Totally worth it, but hard.

FosterAnimals,ff9y40n,t3_esghq1,1579724010.0,"I foster kittens so I can't be very helpful but I can speak on it a tiny bit. Both of the shelters that I foster for require you to be able to crate dogs. Most of the dogs I see available for foster need behavior and socialization training. As for kittens, there is some mess involved, of course, but if you stay on top of it it's not bad. It's important to be able to sterilize your space bc often fosters come with germs and diseases. A lot of other fosters have designated spaces or even a room just for their foster animals. In fact, one foster just remodeled her foster room to have a tiled floor, lol.

Take fiber supplements or stool softeners (stool softeners were too harsh on my system) regularly. If your starfish starts hurting take care of it by keeping it clean.

prolife,ff7ttzx,t1_ff7orj6,1579658211.0,What?! Heavens no. What?! Does anybody? When those deaths happen it's usually because of bleeding out or conditions like preeclampsia or HELLP. I've had preeclampsia and have been suspected of having HELLP (that's long story...). There's very little that can be done to predict and prevent those tragedies. I don't even blame a woman who did not have access to proper healthcare as that is usually a symptom of systemic problems.

prolife,ff6yfig,t1_ff6ss3e,1579637461.0,"There is so much about women's healthcare that we don't know and it is def one of my biggest frustrations. Prenatal care as well. I think part of it is that there are some ethical concerns with studying women's health. But I also feel like we're just behind on it. The fact that women are told they are overreacting and that there isn't anything wrong when clearly there is. The fact that we have to wait and wait and wait for anybody to pay any attention. I could go on and on. 

I found your bit about transfering your reproductive abilities to somebody else very touching. And I do think that elective sterilization should be more accessible. It's very admirable that you know yourself and can be realistic about yourself. I am not one who will sugar coat motherhood. It's very hard and not for everybody. Instead of glorifying and horrifying pregnancy and motherhood we need to just be open, honest, and upfront about it. Personally I am an open book and will go into as much gory detail as you'd like, lol. It's the functions of the human body, what's the big deal?"
prolife,ff6bwdo,t1_ff65mee,1579623818.0,"Oh, absolutely! There are many ways for a woman to express her femininity and nobody should be placed in a predetermined box of expectations. I have known so many amazing women who have had a wide variety of experiences as a mother or not, which is great. Now, I am a mother but I do not consider that to be my defining characteristic, although it makes my top 5, you could say, lol. Women should be free to make their own choices about their life up until it kills somebody else. If you become pregnant that is your responsibility to follow through with that pregnancy and either raise the child or give it up for adoption. Just as we don't allow women to kill their children or their partner or anybody else, we should not allow a woman to kill her unborn child. 

As for the risky pregnancy I get so mad when women are like- I should be able to get an abortion because being pregnant and give birth can/will kill me! And in case you're thinking I'm exaggerating, I'm not. I wish I was but I'm not. Yes, there are risks with pregnancy just as there are risks with everything. I know a guy who went in for a routine minor knee surgery and died on the operating table. Shit happens. I never expected my pregnancies to go as they did. Now, after 3 I know the likelihood of the risks and have chosen to stop having children. If I did become pregnant I would not abort, I would take the risks. Because like I said before, a woman should be free to choose up until it kills an innocent person. After that baby is conceived you just have to deal with the consequences. It may seem harsh but it sure beats the hell out of killing an innocent baby."
prolife,ff6av93,t1_ff651tb,1579623157.0,I can concede on 2. That's fair. But on 3 it's more what she says with the picture that qualifies as bullying imo.
prolife,ff5q8r9,t3_errwnf,1579605786.0,"I've always felt that abortion is sexist. For a woman to get ahead she has to deny and discard what makes her, in part, uniquely female. True empowerment would come if women were supported, not punished, for having children.

I do want to take a moment with the so called dangers of pregnancy. I hate this argument so much! It makes my blood boil. It is a slap in the face for women like me who have gone through difficult pregnancies with major health concerns. What I went through requires a strength unlike anything I have ever experienced and my issues pale in comparison to other women I know. This arguement is also based on fear mongering. The reality if complications during pregnancy is much less black and white, live or die, than how it is portrayed. If a woman is going to her regular prenatal appointments most complications will be caught before they reach a critical level. Sometimes shit goes sideways but you can't predict it. The truth is that the vast majority of women have normal, uneventful pregnancies.

With that said, that wee baby was so sweet and my heart broke for it and its parents. We talk a lot about exceptions and, of course, ectopic pregnancy is an exception. I think a lot of what makes abortion so wrong is the intent. With an ectopic pregnancy the intent is to save the mother's life, it is not to kill the baby. With abortion the intent to first actively and directly kill the baby and then remove it. Maybe some day our scientific knowledge will progress to the point where we can save the baby in the case of ectopic pregnancy. Perhaps the artificial womb might someday be an option. Until then let us pray for the unborn and fight for their rights. We need to stand up for each little baby and give it its voice."

You will have to check to be sure where you foster does or be prepared for the costs. My advice is look up the shelters closest to you, including animal control and usually under the volunteer tab they will have info about fostering.

Ideas I've had include requiring a police report, counseling, mental health evaluation, and approval from an OB/GYN. Another small exception would be to save the mother's life. That alone is tricky wording and could allow for potential loopholes so it would need to be specifically defined. Perhaps the most likely scenario is that of an ectopic pregnancy. 

>not provide any extra medical support, therapy, and childcare for pregnant women (planned or unplanned). 

I don't think anybody supports not providing extra help but we do disagree with how that assistance would be funded and regulated. This mainly boils down to one's political beliefs on fiscal matters.

When those are done there are frequently complications including hemorrhaging to the point they've need a transfusion and scarring leaving them infertile. Then the mother and often the father are left to pick up the emotional pieces. Depression,  anxiety, and PTSD are very common. And the grief they experience lasts a long time. Heck, my mom miscarried very early on nearly 40 years ago and she and my dad still talk about it. I've known women who name their lost babies, I've seen commemorative tattoos, pictures on their walls, little shrines, and more. Some want to talk about it and raise awareness while others grieve more quietly. These mothers and fathers  know that their tiny angel babies have value and special. And when one of these women become pregnant again, often miraculously, we all celebrate even more. I've told so many friends that I was extra happy for them because of what they had been through.

ThriftStoreHauls,fefmfej,t1_feflo89,1579059478.0,If I remember right these retail for $25 a piece. Holy heck. I just can't even believe I got this score!
ThriftStoreHauls,fefip8w,t1_fefi0se,1579057146.0,"Yeah, like the realistic looking action figure sharks. It was partially covered and the room was dark. World's stupidest shark attack!"
StupidFood,fefiepz,t3_eovz1y,1579056968.0,"Is that Canadian bacon and french fries? I'm not going to lie, I'd eat that."
ThriftStoreHauls,fefhlcu,t1_fefdec6,1579056485.0,"Oh! And your forehead?! What?! Lol. My worst toy related injury was from when I stepped on a shark figure's fin and it took a chunk out of the side of my foot. Much more and I'd probably have needed to see a doc, lol. Damn that shark!"
ThriftStoreHauls,fefhewx,t1_fefdec6,1579056377.0,"Well, it's a smaller thrift store call Wheeler Mission Thrift Store here in Indy. The Wheeler Mission is well known here for doing a lot to help the homeless and people in crisis in our community. There were other new in package toys there too. So maybe a store that was closing donated their unsold inventory for a write off? That's my only guess. They had a bunch of the same pair of shoes in different sizes and these amazing purple, furry vests. Other than that idk. But I will take it!"
ThriftStoreHauls,feffq2f,t1_fefe2l8,1579055369.0,"The one we got is The Lego Ideas Book. It was on sale at half priced books for $3, I think so we just had to get it! It is mostly bigger builds. The boxes I got today come with a mini idea manual and those are pretty small. You might be able to find other books too."
ThriftStoreHauls,fefckzg,t1_fefcgmk,1579053386.0,Absolutely! My boys were thrilled and my husband was pleasantly surprised. I love when I can surprise my guys with something they love.
ThriftStoreHauls,fefchd0,t1_fefbx8h,1579053320.0,What?! Crazy good steal!
ThriftStoreHauls,fefb1nr,t1_fefaba1,1579052375.0,For Christmas my husband bought our kids (so himself) a lego idea book and they were all saying how we needed more pieces. Bam! The thrift gods guided me to this. Momming like a boss!
ThriftStoreHauls,fef9wdk,t1_fef93pl,1579051617.0,"Ikr?! I stared for a moment when I saw them and then I shook them just to be sure. If they'd have had more I may have grabbed more, lol. We are a lego loving family all around."

medizzy,fecfrq5,t3_eocmkd,1578972856.0,I had major hand surgery when I was 18mo old to separate webbed pointer finger and thumb. They took a graft from my groin area. They tried to take low enough and over enough to not catch an area that would grow hair. In all they did a pretty good job. During puberty I did grow a single hair in that area. I just kept it trimmed flush to my skin as plucking was too uncomfortable. I'm in my 30s now and it doesn't grow there anymore. My mom always told me that she was nervous about the graft site choice and was fully willing to get me laser hair removal if it became obvious.

aww,fec8apm,t1_fec74ho,1578968394.0,I started fostering over the summer. Right now I don't have any and I miss them! I feel like my shelter is doing me a favor letting me take care of tiny adorable kittens.
medizzy,fec6lx9,t1_febrrhh,1578967521.0,"You know that scene in Casino Royale where Bond is tied naked to a seatless chair and is whipped repeatedly in his balls? Ok. Now go watch that [scene](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JDJOXiPSRIs) real quick. That is what period pain feels like for women who have a messed up enough uterus to need it removed. Oh, except that beating goes on for days, weeks, at a time and like clock work, starts again month after month after month."
