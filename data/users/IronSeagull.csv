Hold up, this is not the media's fault.  The story was big when the cause was unknown *because* the cause was unknown and people were dying.  When the cause was known the story died down pretty quickly.  The media didn't push a false narrative about legitimate products being responsible.

> Stupid regulations like this cause people to go black market, and right towards the providers that have bad/toxic products. Do you not read history and see that prohibition does not work. Seriously we learned this lesson a hundred years ago yet authoritarians do not seem to understand that banning something does not make it go away, or fix the problem.

Well, for now this stuff is legal in the rest of the states so people will probably continue to buy legitimate products from other states.  If the federal government bans flavored products people will have a couple of options - buy from other countries, or settle for unflavored or tobacco flavored vape products.

- A good, experienced game reviewer (or gamer) can tell how good most games are based on a single play.  The things viewers expect them to figure out through multiple plays, e.g. if the game becomes samey or if their initial play went atypically well/poorly, an experienced gamer or reviewer can figure out from a single play.
- There's nothing wrong with thin cardstock components (e.g. Castles of Burgundy player boards) if they're just as functional as thicker components.

Building a deck isn't very difficult right now, because there's not a whole lot of cards out yet.  Start with the pre-constructed decks, play a few games, and you'll start to recognize which cards are good and which are not.  There's only like 5 extra cards from each aspect in the base box, and they're all copies of cards that are already in the decks, so you're only going to slightly modify the starter decks.

Then when you buy a hero pack (e.g. Captain America) you'll get another preconstructed deck that you can play out of the box, plus one card from each of the other aspects (x3 copies of each).  So you'll have a lot more variety in one aspect and a little in the others.  Play with Captain America, see what you like, combine it with what you like from the base box, etc.

They made the deck construction pretty simple in this game, because each hero has 15 cards that HAVE to be included in their deck, no modifications.  There's also a few auto-includes from the neutral cards, so you're really only making decisions about half the cards in your deck.  And you can't mix aspects, so that significantly limits your options.  Compared to a game like Lord of the Rings where you're starting from scratch and could mix factions, Marvel Champions is so much easier."
