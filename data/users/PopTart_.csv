astrology,ffaathn,t1_ff9hio3,1579731262.0,"It’s called gaslighting when they tell us we are overreacting or that we’re making a big deal over nothing, and it’s very unhealthy. I’m still struggling with not contacting him right now, but I’m going to try and stay strong!! It’s very recent for me :/ you’re giving me some hope that it will get easier"
astrology,ff8anvv,t1_ff88w2e,1579671074.0,"The lack of sensitivity and genuine apologies are things I cannot compromise on anymore at this point in my life. The superficiality in day to day life leaves me missing something and not 100% happy even though he is the love of my life and we have insane chemistry and pure love between us. But I started to not like him after so many years and grew apart. 

As far as your ex, I know how Aries men are and they keep moving forward even if they are not really thinking their decision through enough. They act before they think. They are impulsive and I won’t miss that, because it’s affected me negatively so many times without any acknowledgement of its effect on me. You deserve recognition of your feelings, he can’t   justify his behavior just because he thinks you’re overreacting or whatever emotionally immature thing he tells you. I’m not sure if you were able to get a word out with him in conversations or felt like he was really listening to you, because I couldn’t and didn’t. And I want to have a voice and to be and feel appreciated by my partner. I had so much build up resentment after 15 years that there was no way for me to let it go anymore, it was making me sick.

You are going to meet someone who can meet your emotional needs and is another love of your life, it will happen for you."

astrology,ff7ic63,t1_ff71rkj,1579650227.0,"I’m a Pisces and my very recent ex BF is an Aries and I tried for a very long time (15 years) to make it work, but he couldn’t meet my emotional needs... my sad feelings and moodiness overwhelmed him and he also could never apologize when he hurt me, which got really old... but he was fiery and passionate and has great magnetic energy and he will always be the love of my life. I got sick of compromising on what I needed in the relationship since he wasn’t capable of owning his behavior (like a toddler), and I want an emotionally mature man in the future. (I’m not perfect either) 

I’m happy for you! Aries and Pisces are super compatible if the Aries can chill out a bit when you need him to, and I wish it could have worked out for me and my ex."
photoclass2020,ff2hqng,t3_ep8wya,1579506656.0,"I have a Fuji XT20 with the kit 18-55mm. It’s really fun to learn on,  I won’t grow out of it, and it’s great for travel due to the size...The picture quality is great  (24 megapixels, thank you previous assignment)... I like how the EVF shows live pictures as you change settings to “edit” them as you shoot...really neat after only using 35mm film cameras years ago.

My camera is perfect for this class and I’m enjoying every assignment.  

I would like a full frame camera eventually but I’m in no rush... I’m not a fan of how quick the battery runs out, but I always carry two...It felt a little small, so I bought a grip and it’s comfortable now."

wholesomememes,fem4xys,t1_fem188m,1579239909.0,"I just got out of a very long relationship a few days ago and I’m struggling hard right now. Im totally lost, filled with self-hate, and can’t forgive myself for hurting the love of my life, but my emotional needs were never met in the way I needed to truly be happy and content. I can’t imagine my life without this person who I’ve been with for half my life. I also have some other issues I need to work on from the traumatic loss of a parent over a year ago.

Thank you for your advice and I hope I can start on the path to loving myself for the first time ever."

I couldn’t pinpoint what I don’t like about my chair photo, but I agree with it needing more contrast! I think that would really help the chair pop. Thank you for your feedback!"
photoclass2020,fdqfdbv,t3_eleotm,1578665246.0,"I chose the Danish photographer Kristen Klein, I like her moody black and white photography style. The photo I chose is somewhat blurry and grainy but it works really well for me. The lighter foreground is in the lower third and the moon light is upper left, and the tree is the focus of the image and I’m not sure if she used a flash to get the highlight on the tree trunk or not. The darker brush on the right flows nicely and allows your eyes to follow after the tree branches. 

Kristen uses older cameras and cyanotypes in her photography and does night images. I love the high contrast, and the light in her images is beautiful. I imagine she does a lot of post processing like Ansel Adams (whose work I love also).

The beach photo is of my favorites because of the composition, the sky and shiny texture of the palms and saturation/ color overall, the detail of the face colorings on the frigate bird, and the sunlight. 

The chair I’m not 100% on, but I liked the light and warmth overall, but maybe it should be cropped a bit on the left.

Thank you!"
