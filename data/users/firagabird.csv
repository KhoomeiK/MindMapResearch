That explains why you don't consider BS as strenuous enough to be part of a fitness routine, hehe. Reviewing my comments, I had failed to mention my current fitness level. Basically, I'm highly sedentary, working from home as a software dev. A 30-minute session of Easy & Normal songs in BS will certainly get me gasping for air, and even brisk walking for an hour gets me winded & my joints sore.

I certainly would love to share with you & this community my fitness progress, though! Getting advice from people much more experienced than me in this field would be tremendously helpful. After some self-research into muscle growth, I at least understand the basic concept of progressive overload. In my case, the barbell I use for deadlifts is owned by a housemate, and doesn't really have extra discs beyond the 40lbs already on it. My idea then is to increase my reps every few weeks."

However, I recently started measuring my body fat percentage to check if that was purely muscle. Lo and behold, out of my 3kg lost since last month, 40% was from my previous muscle mass.

The closer you get to your goal weight, the more important lean muscle becomes. A calorie deficit is a big sign for the body to eat through your muscle for protein. The less you have, the lower your metabolism. This must be counteracted with strong signals to preserve & build muscle, which is where exercise comes in.

I now alternate between morning walks & light exercise at home. Combined with eating 0.8g protein per lb of bodyweight among other things, and I'm sending enough signals for my body to build muscle while burning fat despite eating at a caloric deficit. We'll see in another month if this routine will pan out for me, but I encourage you to do the same."

That said, even the optimistic result shows that of the 3kg I shed off the scale, 1.2kg was muscle.

This sucks. I know how hard & slow it is to gain muscle. At least I have a good idea what may have led to my muscle loss: a combination of frequent cheating over the holiday season (both keto & IF), as well as the complete suspension of any physical activity due to a chronic foot issue (sprained ankle and/or gout).

Over the coming weeks, I plan to return to my old, healthy habits as consistently as possible. In particular, I'm attempting to implement a variation of the protocol that was shown in one study to lead to Body Recomposition (on mobile; check my post history for details). The protocol entails the ff.:

* 16:8, 3 meals - meal frequency is linked with enhanced muscle growth
* >=0.8g protein per lb of body weight
* Strength training 3x/week

I've modified this protocol to suit my lifestyle, as well get a bit more autophagy:

* 20:4 up to OMAD on my non-exercise days
* Beat Saber (physically strenuous VR game) for strength training
* Daily morning walks on my off days (have tried doing this daily; hurts my knees & ankles)

I also started trying to do light deadlifts (5x5, 40lbs) last month; if I feel up to it, I'll sub a BS session or two with a lifting session."

myopia,fejptu0,t1_fejb6hz,1579182751.0,"> BTW, you made a very quick equalization; it's worth it to check your eyes individually, to see both are getting similar focus and avoid getting used to focusing only with one eye.

Thanks for the advice. Yeah, I'm starting to discover this when my eyes start focusing while wearing the glasses. When covering an eye and flipping between them, I can clearly see the left/stronger one getting sharp focus whereas the other is quite blurry still. This alarms me; I should at least legible text out of both eyes at the same time, otherwise I fear my brain will just rely exclusively on the stronger one.

In hindsight, I maybe should have made a more conservative equalization of -1.00/-1.25, which still goes halfway toward my original half-diopter inter-eye difference. Having already bought my glasses, I will do my best with it. It's still a huge improvement over my previous low-FOV, full prescription frames. For now, I'll try to focus on less distant text & details, and check if each eye focus to equivalent clarity.

> Now I wonder: if the years of stupidly extreme distance undercorrection have diminished my unconscious desire to focus, how could I re-train it?

This is a really good question, and I'm interested to see how you answer it. The bit about seeking out situations requiring focus may help explain how Mark Warren's peripheral movement awareness helps improve vision. I know from prior knowledge (motivated primarily through the mechanics of eyesight in VR) that while your central/foveal vision is sensitive to detail, your peripheral vision is sensitive to movement. If you become aware of peripheral movement then, it may stimulate the same part of your brain that handles your foveal sensitivity to detail. Specifically, noticing peripheral movement makes you aware that your central vision is out of focus, triggering a subconscious impulse to accommodate until the observed detail gains focus."

myopia,feij3bo,t1_fehyxd7,1579139698.0,"> Can you elaborate more on the ""Slow Blink"" please? 

Sure! Admittedly, it's a term I just came up with for myself, but the technique is practiced by Mark Warren together with his mobile movement exercise. Check out this video: https://youtu.be/ccgw6WODV90. The actual bit with slow blinking is described 4 minutes in, but I suggest you also watch the full video.

> It's the same reason that if you create the ""OK"" symbol with your fingers, like a small hole between your index finger and thumb, and look through the hole it creates, you'll probably see almost perfectly through it. (note you have to make the hole very small for this to work) 

I've been doing this ever since I was a kid! Always seemed amazing to be able to make ""DIY binoculars"" that let me see far away just by making two pinholes with my fingers, hehe.

The effect is different from Warren's ""slow blinking"" method, which tells you to slowly open your eyes and keep them as wide open as possible. The point in which your vision sharpens up is several seconds after they're wide open (and after some stinging).

> I'm not doubting the fact that your vision is improved, but I'm very skeptical about many of the methods touted on the internet.

This is a good position to take. Even now, as this online stranger is replying to you, it should be taken with a grain of salt. The best way to find out if it works is to experiment with these methods firsthand, like I did.

---

A note on reduced lenses/prescription: it may be because of my low myopia relative to everyone else on this sub, but I could get away without buying a new pair of glasses.

The biggest factor for me was the edge of blur distance (D2) i.e. the distance of your monitor/book/phone such that it starts to blur but can still be read without glasses. If that distance is not too close as to cause discomfort, you can hold off on buying reading glasses. (Distance glasses are another matter, though.)"

After researching more thoroughly, I discovered [this recipe by TPH Keto Desserts](https://youtu.be/zxP3s1_z2TA). Turns out that the secret ingredient is milk powder. Blending that into the cacao butter mixture while it cooled allowed the other ingredients to mix nicely together.

Making this healthy (the stearic acid in cacao butter is magical in its nutritional value) keto dessert was also somewhat of a mental milestone for me. In my area, I'm fortunate to have ready access to cheap coconut milk powder, which is a great substitute for regular milk powder (way too high in sugar) & heavy cream powder (rare & expensive). There is, however, one downside; the product contains maltodextrin.

In my old mindset, I would have avoided any product containing maltodextrin & Co. like the plague. Recently however, I've been actively trying to embrace IIFYM. The fact is, the amount of maltodextrin in the 3 tbsp of coconut milk powder needed for an entire bar of white chocolate is only 2g. Serving size is a clear factor, and the other pros vastly outweigh this one small con.

Will I continue to use this Coconut milk powder? Absolutely. It's cheap, convenient, and honestly very healthy. When used in white chocolate, you won't even notice a coconut taste. IIFYM has allowed me to make use of this wonderful product despite the presence of a less ideal ingredient. Definitely looking forward to getting other keto recipes that were previously unavailable due to needing milk powder."

Calorie wise, eggs & organ meats are a much better source of A & many other fat soluble vitamins."
