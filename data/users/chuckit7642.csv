MakeupEducation,fdv9c40,t1_fdv8n6l,1578744847.0,"Applying primer onto your face before applying foundation is critical. The primer acts as a barrier between your skin and the makeup, so oil from your pores won’t melt it off."
MakeupEducation,fdv8jgd,t3_en6bbx,1578744626.0,"I have combination skin. 

You need a really good primer that won’t make you breakout. I use Too Faced Hangover Primer. I don’t know if it will work for you because you have sensitive skin. But a good primer will prevent your makeup from sliding off of your face. 

Tarte Amazonian Clay Foundation is really good for oily skin. It is matte.

The soda machine was broken, the line was long, and people were hungry. But the staff remained friendly, patient and professional. I didn’t think leaving an online review was enough, so I called KFC’s customer service line to tell them that the staff at this location did a great job. KFC sent me a voucher for a free meal and a short letter of apology for my experience...lol. I guess they were used to receiving complaints."
