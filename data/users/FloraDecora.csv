I have several comorbidities actually diagnosed though, like TMJ and Degenerative disc disease / pinched nerve

So basically they've given up on looking? I could probably get a diagnosis if I could afford it so I could bypass insurance... I'll keep trying, I just moved so I get to pick all new doctors. These doctors might provide better care."

Sometimes doctors can't give you any actual useful information, but it's still worth trying to ask =/."
AskReddit,fcihkhp,t1_fci6n5r,1577662663.0,"I have severe chronic pain, getting high makes me WANT to clean the house actually. If I'm not feeling motivated, sometimes I'll take a dab as a reward after completing a chore. Like ""if I do all these dishes, I will smoke after""


I feel like some people use it as a crutch, and an excuse to do nothing but some people actually do feel better with it.


I always pay bills, and get my cats food and medicine taken care of before I buy my medicine.


I'm definitely addicted though, but it's because my quality of life is higher."
