The biggest carbon emissions come from energy, heating and transport. 

What is energy used for? Production of goods and resources. Who consumes the goods and resources? Everyone. 

Everyone needs to do a self-audit on their own lifestyle. There are tons of things we can change easily and cheaply. 

We need to make these things common and popular. 

Stop buying unnecessary stuff. Avoid overpackaged, single use, and individually wrapped items. 

Buy quality clothing and household goods that last a long time. Swap or buy fast fashion from friends or from Facebook marketplace. If you can't afford new, there are awesome bargains around that are pristine. 

Don't buy minor items that have to be shipped across the world. Buy produce from your local shop, which is usually cheaper anyway.

And so it is in life. Scotty from marketing made an assumption that nobody gave a shit but he was wrong. 

Lots of people are just struggling to eke out an existence, and are afraid that everything is going to get much more expensive, or harder, or both.

People have this picture of who are ruining the planet, but it's not clear cut. 

Most of the wonderful things that are being done to minimise the damage are from people getting together and making a collaborative effort. 

I'm often surprised at the weird mixture. Very young and very old, privileged and low income, scientists and uneducated.

Although they do want to control the way its dealt with,  most big corporations sat up and took notice about climate change years  ago. They are hedging their bets and trying their best to mitigate damage to their bottom line.  

 It's mostly the pollies that are balking at the cost of change. They want to leave it for the next guys to fix, hence the denial or minimalising.

*Probably the best investigation of Bare-nosed wombat burrows was done in the early 1960's by a 16 year old schoolboy, Peter Nicholson.*

**He would sneak out at night to explore the burrows, and crawled through many of them**. *He found that there was usually only one wombat in a burrow, but sometimes there'd be two.*

*The burrows were often a network of tunnels, and one burrow was about 60 feet long. The wombats were often digging, altering or extending their burrows. They were also sociable and would visit each other's burrows.*"

Often they also have reps to go out to evacuation centres or in the township to start claims off and often give out vouchers to buy toiletries, clothing and other necessities. 

There are also some donors that are assisting with people rebuilding their lives after the fires. I got a notice on my banking app that NAB are giving grants of $2000 for affected people. 

[Andrew Forest](https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-09/andrew-forrest-pledges-$70m-donation-to-bushfire-relief/11854654) donating $70m and is arranging 1200 volunteers to help clean up and rebuild. Government is providing $1000 immediate payment too. 

Hopefully the assistance will be evenly spread and people put their hands up if they are struggling."
