AnxietyDepression,fckxre8,t3_ehmvgl,1577735463.0,"maybe try journaling or finding one thing that you’re very passionate about, even something small like painting or doodling, and just do that whenever you’re sad to calm you down. and also, one thing that is really helpful, is to be proud of the small things too. like walking down the hallway to the kitchen or standing up in the shower, just like feel the small victories because those can make all the difference"
AnxietyDepression,fckx3kn,t3_eho0iw,1577735060.0,"typically if i have to speak to a bigger crowd of people or to one, i like to have someone i feel very comfortable talking with with me in the group, because i know that ill have someone that knows me very well in the group to sympathize with me. or if i have to present, ill look at the same person or someone else who im comfortable with because ik they’ll have my back and they will be supportive. i know it’s hard at first but things will get better."
AnxietyDepression,fc2qvve,t3_efujgx,1577371366.0,"try and talk to him about it. sit down, (plan the basis of what you’re going to say beforehand) and talk about it with him. be straightforward with how you feel, and just have some good old fashioned communication."
AnxietyDepression,fc2qhdl,t3_efw0p1,1577371009.0,"im sorry that’s how you’ve felt, but i understand how you feel. all i can say is that im hoping that things get better for you, and know that even though i don’t know you all that well, im rooting for you."
SuicideWatch,fc1dkgb,t3_e46fmp,1577315560.0,"my parents barely noticed anything, except that ive been isolating myself and not talking as much to them. we took this mental health screening in health and i got the result back as most likely suicidal, and my parents seemed concerned, except that ive talked to them about it before, and when i make suicidal “jokes” (comments like “i want to be hit by a bus” or “i wanna jump off a cliff”) they just go “you’re just being a teenager when sometimes i really truly feel it in my soul that i want to. my mom doesn’t understand my anxiety sometimes and it upsets me because i can’t just stop being anxious on command when it fits your plans. and im tired all the time because it’s all exhausting and they get annoyed by it when i feel like im going to pass out and it’s a lot. sorry this is long and random hopefully no one else has to feel like this or worse."
