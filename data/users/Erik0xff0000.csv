You probably should not ""eat back exercise calories"" unless you do large amounts of exercise (eg professional athlete level of training). Just keep an eye on the scale. If you lose weight too fast you can always eat a portion of exercise calories."

Calorie burn estimates are often overestimated. A lot of people do not ""eat back exercise burn calories"" for that reason when the exercise isn't excessive.
