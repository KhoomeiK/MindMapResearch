HalfLife,fgkexf8,t1_fgj4j3l,1580863963.0,Also in both Half Life and Opposing Force you can find Scientists there that are alive.
HalfLife,fgkeqvu,t1_fgj7nwx,1580863842.0,"Yeah but that model is never supposed to be seen by the player. He also appears to be wearing the HEV suit before you actually pick it up, so is it now canon that he was wearing it during the tram ride?"
HalfLife,fgkepvf,t1_fgj8v02,1580863822.0,HEV suit has unique access to hammerspace.
HalfLife,fgkem2p,t3_eyreem,1580863754.0,"Xen probably just has oxygen? If it didn't, there's no reason why the helmet could help because it's quite possible there is literally no oxygen to filter out of the atmosphere."
HalfLife,fgkej1b,t1_fgia8pa,1580863699.0,Because the weapon isn't really that unique. It's like halfway between the SMG and pistol.
HalfLife,fgke0th,t1_fgi94xa,1580863371.0,"As someone who got the Rift S for Alyx, it's been worth it so far. Tracking is good (just make sure you don't get the cameras covered with headphone wires lol) and controllers are pretty awesome. I have had issues with the controllers making it difficult to rack pistol slides in H3VR, but hopefully Half Life: Alyx will do something to remedy that (most likely will because Alyx uses actual hands, while H3VR uses floating controllers with grip points). Plus, as far as I can tell the Odyssey controllers are much worse in that specific scenario, so."
facepalm,fgk1i9x,t3_eyvbom,1580855563.0,Depends on the context of this form.

halo,fgf3svl,t1_fgf2v5g,1580722868.0,Probably not Opensauce specifically but like compatibility with Opensauce maps maaaaybbeee but I doubt it'd be at launch.
halo,fgea098,t1_ffxnizl,1580694789.0,"No, originally it was a ""we might think about it"" but now it seems to be a definite."

halo,fge97m3,t3_exrxkw,1580694249.0,The problem with the H4 infected spartans was that you couldn't edit their weaponry.
facepalm,fg9mlli,t1_fg9iiwq,1580640709.0,Yeah seems quite a few didn't learn special relativity.
facepalm,fg9mfhi,t1_fg8olwm,1580640633.0,the actual answer is just Special Relativity.
HalfLife,fg5orls,t1_fg54j99,1580533592.0,well good thing they still exist huh? that's a special variant
HalfLife,fg4x07z,t3_ewqiov,1580512988.0,you know this was originally a flare launcher right? they didn't change the model at all

HalfLife,fg364m0,t3_ew351t,1580471863.0,"I mean it's literally made of exposed circuit boards on her hands, they probably weren't very durable and she simply stopped using them when not required. Maybe she used them while Gordon was on the coast and then had to leave them behind somewhere, or they broke."
HalfLife,fg35zqn,t1_ffzy4yf,1580471710.0,Isn't this thing called 'the vault'? I've heard that name somewhere. I assume that should hint at it's function (maybe it holds or manufactures weapons? Or some dangerous combine technology?)
HalfLife,fg35y3c,t1_fg0npp3,1580471660.0,Your headcanon is probably based on the original concept of the citadel (i.e. it being teleported into the cities).
HalfLife,fg35v9k,t3_ewf2a9,1580471570.0,It's gonna be like Black Mesa in that every mirror is inexplicably smashed.

HalfLife,fg35cuz,t3_ewloaa,1580470984.0,"Valve doesn't like consoles and won't allow it.

EDIT: This doesn't reflect my opinion. I think it'd be great to have it on consoles. But Valve has consistently refused to have third party games using their IP be allowed on consoles. When PAYDAY 2 used a CSGO map for a heist, for example, Valve did not allow it to be released on consoles. Same for the L4D No Mercy map on the previous game."
HalfLife,fg34ys8,t1_fg050no,1580470515.0,Halo 2 had the 'limited to Original Xbox' syndrome.
halo,fg2s03g,t1_fg1b8eh,1580453508.0,"Yeah, they already added new weapons to H2AMP, why not add some halo 3 weapons and maps?"

halo,fg2r2qm,t1_fg2qkld,1580452521.0,This certainly isn't halo 5 test footage. There's no reason to have such a high quality models in a low quality map unless they are placeholder models from previous games (which they most definitely are).
halo,fg2qu2g,t1_fg2oq7f,1580452267.0,"Wait, did Reach use mocap overall, or only for facial movements?"

oculus,ffzcvde,t1_ffzcnkx,1580372709.0,Would sunlight coming through blinds be a problem then? I believe that on the shelf it wouldn't be directly hitting the lenses or the cameras but obviously the light would still be there.

BlackMesaSource,ffsfa5d,t3_eqe5e6,1580180285.0,"Yeah they do need to add some disability options, such as turning down light effects for photosensitivity, reducing the need to move during the boss battles (if you aren't capable of reacting quickly), colourblind settings, etc."

bonehurtingjuice,ffomqkr,t1_ffo32y1,1580079269.0,"yes but there is still a joke here. it uses the bhj idea of changing the meaning of the meme and acting as if that is what was intended

Undertale,ffhe2ut,t3_etfiq8,1579931489.0,of course he had a reason. except that they were innocent children
HalfLife,ffd8f8z,t1_ffd7vks,1579815441.0,keep in mind that the game hasn't been designed with jumping in mind. simply adding a jump button without testing it could absolutely break the game. and i don't think they have enough time to add a new mechanic like that
HalfLife,ffd7qpk,t3_esrdd0,1579815054.0,boneworks created a lot of accessibility issues for those who were prone to motion sickness. Valve is likely trying to avoid that.
