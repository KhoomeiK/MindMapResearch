I wonder if he's one of those guys whose brain actually sees the game decently (or even really well), but his body is actually someone elses that's just being borrowed, so every action is fought off. 

It would make some of the mindless running around explained... it's really the original body's host trying to escape."

videogames,feez4s4,t1_feewtko,1579044416.0,"Well, Rocket League is a fun ""5 minutes at a time"" game. It kinda looks dumb from the outside but it's fun as heck to play. I didn't go into the competitive side though so I can't speak for that. 

RPG-ish game like Stardew Valley might bridge a bit of the divide as well. Freedom to do what you want, but you can still RPG-lite it a bit if you play it like that. 

If you're a PC gamer I love the challenge I've faced from Hearts of Iron 4, but I will say that one is definitely not for everybody. 

RTS for a PC gamer, I have a special fondness for the original Company of Heroes (available on Steam, runs on a toaster oven these days). The multiplayer is pretty sparse these days but the campaign was fun and the vs CPU skirmishes are pretty fun too in their own right, even if they do play differently. 

Hitman 1 (never played 2 yet) on PS4 was my jam. Finding fun ways to play through the missions was, well, fun. If you are the 'minmax' type you can play it that way too, but I found 9/10 of the fun was making a target die in ""unintended"" ways just to see if it could be done."

todayilearned,fdr8a8q,t1_fdqvj8p,1578680860.0,">Would you care to re-read your comment and mine and modify ? 

Yes I would. 

I was wrong, I was thinking the opposite way around. The higher pressure would yield lower cabin altitude inside the cabin (which what I thought you were getting at) rather than the actual pressure inside the cabin.  

Like when flying from a system of high pressure to a lower pressure, your altimeter will read higher (which is where my brain was at) than your actual altitude. You weren't suggesting that the cabin *altitude* was pressurized to ""Below sea level"" (Which it absolutely is not) which is what I interpreted. 

Oops. 

I'm downvoting myself for talking before caffeine."
todayilearned,fdquekc,t1_fdqkpot,1578675061.0,">Pressure inside an airliner flying at 33000 feet is lower than that at ground level

~~No, no it isn't. Commercial airliners at cruise altitude are typically pressurized to a pressure altitude of 6000 to 8000 feet. Even being 4-5k short of maximum cruise altitude wouldn't make it sea level, much less below it.~~
