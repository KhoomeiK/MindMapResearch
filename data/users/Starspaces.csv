thebachelor,ff5wcmc,t3_erufaf,1579612453.0,The way some people project onto Hannah is disturbing. She's just a flawed human. No need to wax poetic about how she's so wronged and pure.
thebachelor,fekfx1k,t1_fek4t8i,1579199207.0,What friend?
thebachelor,fe9i6bp,t1_fe9cajs,1578937753.0,"I agree that Hannah was not there by choice, I even said the producers do not have her best interests at heart. I also didn't say much about Nick, because that's beside the point I was making. Before Nick said anything, a lot of people felt Hannah was selfish and unfair to say what she did. Maybe Nick is projecting, his season was ages back but honestly, that doesn't negate the fact that Hannah did say things that were not fair to say to Peter the first week of his journey. The way Hannah is infantilized on here is getting a bit disconcerting. Loving someone means accepting that they are flawed and can do something that's selfish and hurtful to others, even if they don't mean to. I don't know when this sub became so black and white. Hannah is clearly saying whatever she feels like, call it honesty or pressure or whatever, but it's been months and there will be a point where people will want to hold her responsible for her actions despite how awfully her season turned out. My heart goes out to her because she is struggling with things so many of us do when we're young and she has been in the public eye for way too long, but she also lacks maturity and empathy for others (evidenced by how she treated the rest of the men when she was trying to rationalize keeping Luke, or how she's been unable to make up her mind about her F4 well after the season without much consideration for any of their feelings)"
thebachelor,fe8onnx,t1_fe6qzig,1578928703.0,"I like Hannah, but she is babied way too much on here. No one knows Hannah's motivations, but Nick is pointing out that *choosing* to say all of that to Peter when he's finally moving on is kind of selfish. At some point adults have to be held responsible for their actions and how they affect other people even if they are emotional or under pressure. We can all say things that can break other people or hurt them because we might have some emotional power over them, but we shouldn't. That's what maturity is: keeping things to yourself if they shouldn't be said. And telling Peter he was her true F2, no matter how true or false or true in that moment in Hannah's head or whatever- it's not done, not when he's just starting his own journey. It's obviously not easy but Hannah knows how fucked up the producers are. She knows what they probably wanted from her the second they asked her on."

HaircareScience,fdwf5qq,t3_en6qpe,1578758097.0,"As some living in one of the most polluted places in the world, here's what helped me:

Cod liver oil tablets 

Biotin tablets

Overnight oil treatment once a week (mix of castor oil, olive oil, pumpkin seed oil with a few drops of rosemary, cedarwood and peppermint oil)

Once a month rinsing my hair with AHA/BHA facewash before shampooing to get rid of buildup

Once a week hair mask in the shower 

Air drying 

Doing all this at once really changed my hair. Way less hairfall and much thicker and smoother in texture. Good luck!"

thebachelor,fdk7von,t1_fdk7fq8,1578498089.0,So people aren't allowed closure now? No one interacts with each other post the show? Have you seen Becca? This is so extreme lmao you really gave away how entitled you are on Hannah's behalf if you think DMing her means he owes her a relationship now
thebachelor,fdk7auu,t1_fdk6ayk,1578497711.0,">every single thing youâ€™ve listed has a reason

How do you know? Other than your outrage at the fact that he didn't make himself completely available for the woman who rejected him the moment she changed her mind?

Tyler and Hannah getting back together after ATFR would have been a lovely story most of us were rooting for, but it was also so unlikely after how Hannah treated and has continued to treat her F2 and F3. Even Hannah has let that go, but here you are lol

If you really think this is gassing people up rather than pointing out your insane standards for anyone who comes into contact with your fave, idk what else to say. Stan culture is cancer."
thebachelor,fdk4ac6,t1_fdjyxxh,1578495703.0,"I already replied to you in a previous comment, and I don't think we're likely to agree as we have wildly different notions of what mature, healthy, normal behaviours in relationships are. What you think is an indication of terrible character, is what I think is self-respect I actually admire. You're so critical of someone who got dumped and further minimized by your fave, but you have all the empathy in the world for the way she's conducting herself months later no matter who it hurts, be it Peter, the new girls, or even Tyler. To be clear, I also have empathy for Hannah, but it isn't selective. It extends to other people on the show as well."
thebachelor,fdk3q83,t1_fdjyo92,1578495318.0,"Why must everything Tyler does be interpreted in the worst faith possible?

He shows her support when the other F4 are either silent or jackasses, he must be lying.

He says he supports her, he is doing it for attention.

He accepts her plan for drinks (asked on national TV in front of a hyped audience), he better date her or else he's a fuckboy.

He meets her and then stays the night talking, clearly gets closure and moves on to someone who actually seems interested in him? He was playing her and is fame-hungry.

He tweets SUPPORT at her when something big is happening in her life? We're back to interpreting it as attention-seeking.

What world are you guys living in? Leads stay friends with their F2,3,4 all the time. Look at Becca. This mindset of guys are always the toxic assholes even when they get dumped and girls are always the victims is really something else. So according to you, Tyler must pretend that Hannah no longer exists at all because absolutely anything he does otherwise means he's fame-hungry. (Even though he has more followers than any BN male ever and is now hanging out with supermodels and the IG famous.) And the funniest thing is I'm sure it didn't miss your attention just how mad people were when he *wasn't* talking about Hannah because that way he must have been lying when he said he was her biggest supporter. The dude literally can't win.

I'm all for calling out manipulative assholes, but this is completely absurd. You're replying to everyone in the comments section who even hints that maybe Tyler isn't a calculating psychopath. If there was some dirt on him, any at all, we would have heard it. Liking Hannah doesn't mean you go to such insane lengths to rewrite her season and absolve her of any responsivity for her actions whatsoever. This isn't a novel where she's the main character. He's allowed to move on. You do remember that she dumped him, right? Do you think it's a small thing to turn down someone's *proposal*? And you're still going at it and demonizing him even when Hannah just went on national TV to say that Tyler was actually her third choice, not second? Dude, this just isn't how mature, heck, even normal people work. People try to keep their self-respect. They try to stay on good terms with other good people they cared about. They try to find happiness where they can. They look for love and hope it's healthy. Both your kween and Tyler and doing that. Let them be."

thebachelor,fdjo9eh,t1_fdiywjv,1578480575.0,"I really don't understand Hannah stans. Just because you want her to be happy doesn't mean men she turned down should forever be available to her and fall at her feet when she demands. What you do to move on after a relationship ends doesn't negate the entire relationship on your end. We really have to let go of this toxic view that victimizes women no matter what. Hannah made her choices, and everyone else acted accordingly. She has to live with that."
thebachelor,fdj8nw8,t1_fdj2lg6,1578461627.0,"The way people self insert into Hannah is wild. I'm sorry, if you were dumped on national TV and then had the chance to date a supermodel you'd 100% go for it too. Doesn't mean you're insincere. Maybe...both Hannah and Tyler are decent people trying to do what they hope is best for them."
thebachelor,fdj47t0,t1_fdhq03z,1578458002.0,They're still demonizing him for moving on. After Hannah turned down his proposal on national TV. Guess no one's allowed self respect if it in any way inconveniences their fave's emotions.
thebachelor,fdhm88u,t1_fdhffhb,1578425624.0,"The way I see it he was just being honest, of course he would still have some feelings and he has the right to get closure. (If Hannah deserves it with Peter, so does Tyler with Hannah tbh.) They both said the sleepover was just talking. I truly don't understand how it indicates he now owes her something, especially when last night's episode showed just how messy unresolved feelings with the final contestants can get. But I don't know how Hannah expected they'll get back together when she turned his proposal down. I don't think people realize how big of a deal that is. If your friend got dumped or rejected and the ex came back after their relationship ended, you'd tell your friend they deserve someone who picks them!

I understand the urge to be protective of Hannah because she is struggling so much and so openly, but the expectations placed on Tyler are just bizarre. Just because we like Hannah and want her to be happy doesn't mean Tyler is some player for getting closure after she turned him down. He was her 2nd/3rd/4th choice depending on what you believe she's said at different points about Peter and Luke P. How are people faulting the dude for having self respect?"

I was initially rooting for them when the wrong spoiler was out but as the season went on and I saw the extent to which Hannah was struggling (no shade at all, I'm a few years younger than her but I really relate to her struggles with self worth and relationships) I wanted what was best for both of them separately. Especially after she rejected him and then got her heart broken by her F1 anyways. 

Imo, the hallmark movie aspect of ""Tannah"" is just the fact that they don't have much in common but they're both good, attractive people and the girl is flawed and insecure while the guy is self-assured and genuinely sees her worth."

Women all over the world have been rebelling against society's standards for them and she not only embraces them, but condemns women for rebelling. Sis, the feminists of the world aren't bullying you by wanting to work or suggesting that women should have some security for themselves outside of being wholly dependent on men. How does homegirl think we got the right to vote? She's personally offended by women who work, aren't ""feminine"", sleep around, or want to be independent.

Her videos on femininity are exhausting. And I say that as someone who spends hours and a shit ton of money on clothes, skincare and makeup. Femininity has historically been a trap for women. Hell, the lifestyle she advocates has historically been a trap for women and rendered them susceptible to abuse. Women in South Korea are rebelling against the strict standards set for their bodies. Women in South Asia are embracing their dark skin in a culture that normalizes skin bleaching. But this white girl thinks she's oppressed for liking femininity, lol. She constantly advocates women put inordinate time and energy into their appearance and policing their behaviour to be more palatable. In one of her videos she says women should have perfect, painted toenails every single day of the year, even in winters. Where are her standards for men? Why is her end goal being the most appealing she can possibly be to men both physically and personality wise? She's just trying to influence girls to become trad under her guise of peace and acceptance, plain and simple."
