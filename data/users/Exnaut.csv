Sometimes they're wrong and it is oversimplified of course. Nobody is perfect. But most of the time when I personally looked into it, they are right to a degree"
todayilearned,ffd5qiv,t1_ffd55af,1579813943.0,"Yeah it was different. But it was already pretty damn clear by this point in time sexualizing teens is pretty pedophilic (or if you want to be more specific ""hebephilic""/""ephebophilic"") and just something you shouldn't do."
todayilearned,ffd4ay7,t1_ffd2em7,1579813146.0,"Really? At most they're like 15 years old. It's not that long ago, and it's not hard to think that sexualizing teens, is a big no no. Boku no hero academia started in 2014 but has plenty of sexual shit. Food wars started in 2012 and that has a ton, yeah a good amount of it is comedy oriented but still doesn't shy away from sexualizing them pointlessly over the top.

Although, I will agree looking into it, as you said in recent years by their creation of conception. It does appear to be decreasing slightly over time. Most seem to be around 2000-2010."
todayilearned,ffd2at6,t1_ffcx1x0,1579812013.0,"Yeah, most anime doesn't have it but it's still incredibly normalised in it. Like in gurren laggan with Yoko, she pretty much has the body of a young adult wearing practically nothing with the other male characters constantly being interested in her and she's shown to kinda like the attention. But she's 14 years old. And this stuff is done in other relatively popular, mainstream anime like with Lucy in fairy tail who's 17, Elizabeth in 7 deadly sins who's 16. Even has a bit with asuna in sao who deals with sexual stuff ranging from ages 15-17."
