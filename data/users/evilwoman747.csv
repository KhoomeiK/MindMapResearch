AmItheAsshole,ffbaijk,t3_es701z,1579757477.0,"YTA for a couple of reasons
1. You already had the root canal, the missed appointment was for a follow-up. So you're going to a new dentist to have them go through all the background and the details of the procedure that they did not do, just to tell you how it's healing?
2. It is extremely common for specialized company's to charge a cancellation fee. They missed out on possible thousands of dollars because you couldn't make it. H*ck, even some hair salons charge a cancellation fee. 
3. (This is more for a lot of the commenters) OP never said the Dentist was going to waive the fee. Only that he wanted to discuss it, which I would assume they would go more in depth about why they charge it.

I hope OP can learn. And maybe finish out the procedure then cut ties."
college,ffa7rjv,t3_esffqp,1579729533.0,"I go to a relatively small school, but one of the ways I made my really good friends was within my major. We all take similar courses, one of them taking the same 5 of 6 classes with me one semester. We didnt start off as close, but with that kind of proximity, bonds are sure to happen.
So my advice is to hang on to hope, and as you take more classes in your major just push yourself a little more. When you get to class, turn to the person next to you and just ask how their weekend was. Yes it is super uncomfortable the first few times, but when you show you're willing to reach out, usually others will also reach out."

news,ff38bcx,t1_ff37id5,1579536068.0,"I 1000% agree. I apologize if I'm coming off as an anti-equestrian. I myself have worked with horses my entire life, and don't plan to stop anytime soon. There is definitely a happy medium, where horse and human can be happy, healthy, and loved. Most of the time I take issue with the people that buy a horse just to leave it at a barn all year, or the ""trainers"" that still think it's necessary to break the horses spirit while training."

news,ff328tf,t1_ff30f4c,1579531772.0,"I will admit, I was tired when I wrote the initial comment and so that might be a little extreme. But I would say that there are always things that can happen to the horse, especially if they have a long career. Maxing out their body everytime they step into the arena is putting them at more risk. Though I will admit I've participated in the western events much more. Over time many horses have at least one bout of lameness from something attributed to the sport. Plus the long term effects as the horse ages.
It is definitely a huge responsibility to the rider to think critically everytime they train, compete, etc. To make sure that what their doing wont damage the horse either short term, like a broken leg, to long term. 
BUT I will say that freak accidents do happen. At work we had a horse go on a trail ride, a tree branch broke, he took a half step to the side and broke his leg. There was absolutely no way to prevent it or know it was going to happen. 
Horses are both very strong, and yet the most accident prone animals."
unpopularopinion,ff2vn89,t3_er65w8,1579525905.0,"Pit bulls were used to be considered ""nanny dogs"" because they were so protective, loving, and patient with family, especially children. If we want to look at statistics pitbulls are only 9 on the scale of strongest bites. Which doesn't mean they aren't a force to be reckoned with, but it gives a little more perspective. 
I think people who say that pitbulls are more violent are people that haven't come in contact with a breed such as a chihuahua. Can you imagine one of those ankle biters in the body as large as a pitbull?"
news,ff2ankv,t3_er5gfg,1579498859.0,"Horse racing (and any horse sport in general) is extremely dangerous for the animal. 
Sure, we hear about the successful horses, who are treated like kings and queens. But those are the elite, the lucky ones. 
Unfortunately for many horses they are often severly mistreated. A horse is not fully developed mentally or physically, and ready to have a rider, or any weight on it's back until the age of 4-5. Almost all racehorses are racing at the age of 2. Also, if the horse does not compete well enough, they do not get the cushy life we often hear about. More often they're sent to auction, where slaughterhouses buy them for cheap and kill them. If they end up in the middle, not the elite, but not the bottom either, they end up as breeding stock. Females are bred over and over again until their bodies give out. 
So sure, this track might race thousands of horses a year and have ""minimal"" accidents. But I'm sure there is plenty going on behind the scenes. Is it really worth having 1 famous horse, who is taken care of and loved, if 5 more die before the age of 6 behind closed doors?"
AmItheAsshole,femo4bn,t3_epwqk2,1579264363.0,"NTA. I would really like to see what the brides reasoning is for it. I could maybe understand if they want to pay for the wedding with the money, but if 100 people come that's only $5,000. 
As a Midwestern I can only imagine the show that would go down if that happened. Either no one would go, or that would be the only gift a lot would give. And I'm sure it would be the talk of the family for years to come."
AmItheAsshole,fdx6sj3,t3_en0zfr,1578765901.0,"NTA at all. One recommendation would be to maybe have your daughter go to a speech or seminar from someone that has been injured or who has lost someone in a texting a driving accident? Or even show her and your ex the stories in this thread? I'm sure there are plenty of stories online too. Maybe help her see it from a more compassionate side.

My father was terminally ill, but it still felt sudden when he passed away the day after my junior year.

college,fdow6l8,t1_fdosm5m,1578614263.0,"Ahh, yeah it can be really hard. Your best bet would be to maybe go to the head of your building. Not sure what they're called where you are but at my school they're Area Directors. They should be pretty accessible and willing to talk to you. I'm sorry you're stuck in this kind of situation, and I'm sure your RA is kind of stuck too in this kind of predicament. Roommate issues are some of the most common and yet can be the most difficult situations to deal with."

college,fdo5apx,t3_embdf6,1578599145.0,"As an RA here is my advice:
I would say the RA or even building director (so your RA's boss) should have a talk with the roommate. Having that bad of hygiene violates the community. Also, if her mental health is that bad, then she should be covered to get a room to herself, depending on the AAD requirements. Also, with her aggressive attitudes and outbursts I definitely wouldn't want to live with her.

Unfortunately, what often happens is the person that has the issue with the roommate is asked to move. So good luck OP"

AmItheAsshole,fcyqr2z,t1_fcxknyo,1578085139.0,"That's a really good idea. My boyfriend and I tend to split it semi-evenly, I'll buy for one trip, he buys for another. But he does eat considerably more, especially meat and other proteins. I might bring this up to him!"
AmItheAsshole,fcyq4ia,t3_ejdpwo,1578084793.0,"NTA. One way to get him and your family to back down would he to set high stipulations. Require him to get a full time job, pay rent and his own food etc, and set a strict time limit until he gets a place of his own. Also, set up strict rules for when he can come and go, make noise, how much mess he can make.

This might make him think twice about wanting to live with you. Also, if your family does succeed in getting you to give in, then you wont have a permanent roommate. 

Be strict though, your family doesn't deserve that. Your wife doesnt deserve a misogynist man child to take care of, and your kids don't need that kind of bad influence."

Another option, plan on going into education, perhaps for secondary education or being a professor. I only say this because you mentioned how much you love when people ask you questions, and when you get to explain something. That's what pushed me into education.

These are just ideas, follow your heart though. Only you know what will be good for you."
AmItheAsshole,fcjjaz1,t3_eh998k,1577689813.0,"My family's method was to at first get me a trac phone, it was a flip phone, just for emergencies. Then, the slide phone, I got to experience texting! Then finally, a smartphone. But it was a windows phone, so it didn't have all the fun apps (I missed out on the flappy bird craze, tragic, I know). This was a process that lasted from late elementary school till probably my freshman year of high school, so about 4-5 years. 
Imo this was the best way to do it. I wasn't glued to my phone constantly but knew I would have it if I needed it, and I could always call family. Sadly, I would say I'm now thouroughly addicted to my phone like every other college student, but I was started out right!"

legaladvice,fcipsjj,t1_fcip1sl,1577666940.0,"I am not sure about the washer and dryer, but they mentioned the doors are, but always told us they were coming out soon to fix them. On the doors the lock is stuck out, so when they close they remain open. On one of them if you jiggle it enough it will be closed, but the next time someone walks through it just is open again. The other door is the same way but no jiggling it can fix it. And it is noticeable from the road.

I will have to look at the laws again to see about getting it fixed ourselves. We've struggled and wasted at least $5 in quarters over the month trying to dry laundry. We're lucky enough to have friends and family nearby to do laundry at, but that is getting very old very fast."
