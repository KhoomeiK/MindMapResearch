EatCheapAndHealthy,fewhwdf,t1_feu2tgh,1579410873.0,Oh and you don't have to take it everyday. I don't usually take mine on the weekends or on days off. Just depends how it works for you.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fewhgd7,t1_feu2tgh,1579410643.0,No worries. Google doesn't always know either.
RedditLaqueristas,fev6bpe,t3_eqltpw,1579393574.0,Where do I get a blue fluffy cat!
EatCheapAndHealthy,fev4tya,t3_eqnsq8,1579393096.0,"It's not only calories but type of fat, sodium, sugars, and ""other"" ingredients. And of course the recipe and ratio of oil to other ingredients. My vinaigrette has two tablespoons of oil BUT with vinegar, spices, and a little water you get like 10+ salads worth."
EatCheapAndHealthy,feu2jcy,t1_fetzqoe,1579382501.0,I'm on vyvanse and as I understood it that's not common. It's not like pain meds where you build up a tolerance
EatCheapAndHealthy,fdw11qk,t3_en6exq,1578753946.0,"Prep basics and have ""bases"" on hand. I call them bases, I mean have some whole grain bread, salad mix (spinach), pasta, rice. Then have delicious sauce and seasoning. So you can make fried rice, chef salad, pasta dish, or sandwichs quickly.

Think taco bell menu.... Really just 10 ingredients they put together in different shapes üòã"

HowToADHD,fdk0jol,t3_elt7c0,1578493030.0,I listed all the suggestions as they came in in the post (sorry didn't have patience to sort them lol.)  But there are great comments from redditors about why they liked them. Some got me really interested. TIP: I put a . after the ones I wanted to read first based on comments.

bulletjournal,fdfv12o,t1_fdftsxu,1578370952.0,True. Im probably do a hybrid buju with permafrost pages. I just don't have the patience to make them.

shittyfoodporn,fddncio,t3_ektqlm,1578318566.0,Photo is great. Food... Doesn't sound too bad. I think it's the meat blob for me. Looks like it's a condiment that'll stir in but it's a chunk o meat. Way over analyzing just to agree its in the right place.
bulletjournal,fddmvbm,t3_ektuoo,1578318130.0,Love the mods as a mountain. Also love that the colors are a gradient that makes sense. :)

FreeKarma4You,fccowfi,t1_fccl7qv,1577600912.0,Yep that's why. I've found being an early comment on a post has the best chances of up votes. Short and simple or at least first few words are engaging.

suggestmeabook,fcchmj3,t1_fccgktx,1577598489.0,Oh. I like thrillers but that movie. Do you think picturing jack and that hallway and those twins and that kids voice will help or hurt? Asking so I rather embrace it or forget it when I read it.
