AskMenAdvice,fczj32e,t3_ejlvbj,1578102349.0,"understand that men don't make the distinction between 'friend' and 'potential dating/sex partner' in the same way that women do.

men pretty much consider any female they become friends with to be a possible dating/sex partner unless that female is already in a relationship, and sometimes not even then.  That's not to say that they can't form true friendships with women, but in the beginning the line is blurry if it's even there at all.

Now, knowing that should not require you to change anything about how you act, react, and interact with the male population, as it's not your responsibility to make up for other peoples' possible feelings.

however, it may provide some perspective on why males act the way they do when you are seeking out a friendship with them.

why do you think so many females just tell guys they have boyfriends when they first meet them when they do not?

it's a way to place yourself out of that dating possibility in the beginnings of a friendship with a male.

the only thing you have any control of in this life is your perspective.

When your friend was messing with you about your hat comment, instead of laughing at yourself about how you can be at times, and maybe even tossing in a ""well i just think that Sam should have the benefit of all our opinions, not just you two walking Wafuku looking bastards.""

&#x200B;

do you see how that takes the pressure off of you and puts everything right back into a joking mode?

instead, you took his comment internally and roasted it on your internal spitfire where it festered to the point that you are still wondering about it and asking others for input.  nothing wrong with that, but understanding why you feel this way is the key to solving your issue.

&#x200B;

you said you were the quiet one in the group right?

could this be because you just don't come up with the witty one liners as fast as the other guys?

or you take a long time to think about things that are said, analyzing them deeply before deciding how you feel about them?

if this is the case, then you need to point your lens inside instead of at your friends.

try to learn what it is about yourself that second guesses your gut responses, and work on just letting things out in the moment without trying to ""get it right"".

AskReddit,fc3mmtl,t1_fc298s9,1577393330.0,"since i've had a few requests for some background on this, here goes.

Mom was the second oldest of four kids.  older brother, and younger sister and brother.
her parents were both functioning alcoholics with a very heavy disciplinary hand, meaning slaps and spankings for any wrongdoings.

oldest brother moved out before it got too bad, so didn't see a lot of it.
Mom's solution was to never do anything that would get her hit.

so she got straight A's, never missed school, never tried drugs or alcohol, and basically stayed out of her parents way.

she moved out at 18 and married my dad at 19.
little brother ended up becoming a cop, but is a good guy and not a jerk as far as i have ever seen.

little sister got the worst of it and turned to drugs and terrible decisions with men.

apparently at one point it got so bad that the state took mom and little siblings away for a couple of weeks, but i've never been told the specific situation that brought that on.

Im old enough now that we have a very good relationship and my wife really helped me see that she was doing the best she could with the tools she was given, and once i could see that, it really helped me understand her more.
i can say that somehow the way she and my dad raised me made me into a very empathetic person, but i also developed a hero complex that took a long time to shake off.

hope this is what people were looking for when they asked for details."

that is something that is so common you probably can't find a girl who wasn't at least a small part of it when they were a young teen, but you won't find it with teen boys enough to even register as a thing.

people will say anything in order to get what they want, and what he wanted was for you not to value yourself enough to demand a commitment, and he was hoping you'd just eventually give in and sleep with him.

when it became clear that wasn't going to happen, he back peddled because you still see him socially and he doesn't want any of this getting back to his wife.
