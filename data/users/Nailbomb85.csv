DestinyTheGame,fdflieh,t1_fdfh885,1578364482.0,"It's still a fine weapon for PvP, the downside is that it only truly shines when you're getting final blows in a team fight. Still great to pair it with a strong special or heavy exotic."
DestinyTheGame,fdfl70q,t1_fdfgkz8,1578364273.0,"They're referring specifically to the 450 ARs, which is a weak archetype."
DestinyTheGame,fdfl1g4,t1_fdfk89g,1578364172.0,"The damage actually decreases when it speeds up, so once you're at 2 stacks of rampage you're actually better off using, well, pretty much any other AR."
DestinyTheGame,fdfkv0i,t1_fdfec1z,1578364056.0,"Sure it is, a pinnacle weapon should outperform at least a significant portion of weapons in the same archetype.

Not something I use a ton when I'm paying attention, but I have saved some large blockers when I didn't notice my team all turned back to fight blockers.

DestinyTheGame,fd2w7zl,t1_fd0n8j0,1578152222.0,Or they go all in on the FOMO and the catalyst for the new trace sidearm will be tied to it.
DestinyTheGame,fd2i85q,t1_fczxgy3,1578147610.0,">And does anyone actually use the mods related to finishers? 

Yeah, a few of the mods. Health regen is great, and now there's a mod where using a finisher boosts your super regen instead of drains it."
