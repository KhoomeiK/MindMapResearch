dogs,fetdoqc,t1_ferf1r9,1579374298.0,"There is no certification in the US. We have groups that are dedicated to properly train service animals but they are not certified under the ADA.  The ADA only dictates that a service dog must be well-behaved and able to perform a task and that businesses and housing cannot deny a service animal.  

From the ADA website on service animals: 
Q5. Does the ADA require service animals to be professionally trained?

A. No. People with disabilities have the right to train the dog themselves and are not required to use a professional service dog training program.


Q17. Does the ADA require that service animals be certified as service animals?

A. No"

Ocarina,fefvzsx,t3_eoxksy,1579067004.0,"For ocarinas tuned to C, the fingerings would be the same regardless of whether it's an alto, soprano or bass.  So you can play Amazing Grace on a Soprano C and have it come out the same as if you were playing on an Alto C Ocarina.  

&#x200B;

For Soprano G, you would have to transpose since the notes on the ocarina are from the G Major Scale.  So when you use the same fingering for C, a G would play instead.  You would have to transpose in order to make it sound correct.  

For transposing from C Major to G Major, you're just adding a sharp to the key signature.  So C Major would transpose to G Major, G Major to D Major etc."

Like I know if I messed up but the audience doesn’t have to know. Or if I forget my part, I will just make shit up and make it sound like it’s supposed to sound like it that. 

Technical difficulties: Professionals know how to work around technical issues.  I’ve seen rock bands pull out the acoustic instruments when they lose power or find some other way to entertain the audience. Unprofessional people will just freak out and walk off. 

Leading: soloists should know how to lead.  The orchestra/band will typically follow the soloist. If the soloist is all over the place and nobody can follow them, everything falls apart unless someone else steps in.  

Intonation: most musicians know how to adjust their tone to the outside elements and other instruments. If say, a flutist, won’t tune to the piano or other person they’re playing with, it will sound horrible.  Same if the room is warm or cold, humid or dry and other conditions. 

Playing in the correct key: this goes for improv solos.  If the person starts to play in a different key than what the others are playing in, it sounds horrible.  If they play in the correct key, it sounds wonderful."
