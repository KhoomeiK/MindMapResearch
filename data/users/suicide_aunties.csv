I knew that I was meant for more than this clan would ever allow of me, and I hated them for it. 

One day, the other clan members grew so tired of my refusal to accept his place in the clan that they beat him repeatedly in an attempt to rid themselves of me once and for all. As the chieftain was about to beat me again, the elderly shaman of the clan stopped him, saying that he had tried and failed to help me find his place in the clan. Laying a hand on my shoulder, the elder said, not unkindly, that there was nothing more he could do for me, but that he had always believed there was greatness within me. He then advised me to seek out the Throne of the Elements, for perhaps there I would find my destiny. The chieftain then banished me to the wastes outside the village, saying that there I would come to understand what it meant to have no people."

TLG itself is an easy hike, well marked, and with plenty of human traffic / guest houses for you to go it your own with normal gear. If you're going to trails that can only be found on Chinese sites, that's when you probably want to chat with an agency in Dali or Lijiang, or use Mafengwo/Ctrip to book since you live in China.

I knew that I was meant for more than this clan would ever allow of me, and I hated them for it. 

One day, the other clan members grew so tired of my refusal to accept his place in the clan that they beat him repeatedly in an attempt to rid themselves of me once and for all. As the chieftain was about to beat me again, the elderly shaman of the clan stopped him, saying that he had tried and failed to help me find his place in the clan. Laying a hand on my shoulder, the elder said, not unkindly, that there was nothing more he could do for me, but that he had always believed there was greatness within me. He then advised me to seek out the Throne of the Elements, for perhaps there I would find my destiny. The chieftain then banished me to the wastes outside the village, saying that there I would come to understand what it meant to have no people."

travelchina,fcwqq6w,t3_eja1to,1578033891.0,"Hey OP, unfortunately I went to the same area around end Dec in 2015, so the experience will no doubt be different. We had pleasant days followed by 1 day of snowstorm in a very rural area, where our very experienced guide managed to bail us out. Thankfully that was on our last day of a 7 day hike when we were already near to our destination.

TLG itself is an easy hike, well marked, and with plenty of human traffic / guest houses for you to go it your own with normal gear. If you're going to trails that can only be found on Chinese sites, that's when you probably want to chat with an agency in Dali or Lijiang, or use Mafengwo/Ctrip to book since you live in China.

I assume you're not planning to do any serious peak bagging to places like Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. That's definitely out of normal gear range in Feb."
