I expect a certain amount of bias against epic on r/ fuckepic.  Call it what you will, but it’s not really the same type of forum. 

As far as I know, r/fuckepic has never claimed to be neutral.  

But r/gamedeals is an allegedly neutral open forum that will not hear of any open discussion that doesn’t match their narrative.

fuckepic,ff3a5u2,t1_ff33za6,1579537230.0,"Okay.  Let me explain this to you.  Any subreddit that has terms needs to do two things:   Post the rules, and list which rules are in violation whenever they are enforced.

By doing neither of these things, they’re just bullying under the guise of sub ownership.

In other words, I’ve never argued whether they could shut down content.  We all know they can.  That’s just common sense.  I’m arguing that they shouldn’t, because it’s biased and inconsistent with any discussion.

If they don’t want opinions, then Reddit is not the place      for them to post discounts.  No, they want opinions.  They just don’t want opinions they disagree with...."

It’s too bad, because I used to love them before they unwittingly started trying to kill PC gaming, then Sweeney opened his mouth and killed Epic.  They’re dead to me now.

Bass,fd3084j,t3_ejm6fp,1578153474.0,"Many 5 strings have tension issues on the low b string.  To help resolve said issues, many 5 string basses are 35” or even longer.

Your left hand has to reach across an extra string when fretting some notes.  This is difficult for many beginners.

Longer basses are harder to play certain progressions on, but you may find the extra 5 notes helpful enough to completely negate that factor. Or maybe not even notice.

An extra string to play, is an extra string to mute.

In the long-term life of the instrument, tension issues may complicate intonation-based-repairs down the line.

String spacing is more narrow.  This will be a plus for some folks.

As many others have said, the instrument is also heavier."

Buy a bass you’ve been eyeballing and or really want and keep it in a place where you will be able to look at it often.  When you see that instrument you love, your desire to play will intensify.

If he was a bad choice, then he should have been humble and wise enough to turn down the project.  That’s called “adulting.”

Okay, cool the first time, but a movie can only withstand 1-2 of those moments without losing all impact and becoming a mockery of itself.  TLJ has like 50 of those moments...

Star Wars was never supposed to be done that way though.  If a Star Wars movie is only good on it’s own, then it has failed to accomplish its major goal of fitting into existing lore.  It’s why TLJ doesn’t work.
