The temptations that can undermine that are everywhere. 3.5k may seem like a lot at 18, but in the grander scheme the few hundred you made a month playing isn't a living. It's fun money for your youth.

Focus on how you can constructively develop your career over the next 2, 5, and 10 years. Be successful there and you'll make more than you ever had at the tables in a far more rewarding manner. Maybe poker finds a healthy place as a hobby later in life, but perhaps it is best not as a part of your life."

More broadly there is an over saturation in many markets. The demographic tend is not good for the industry, there is limited interest in casinos and disposable income for younger generations. While the interest level from retiring boomers is better but still relatively lower than their parents.

In a lot of markets the first movers were restricted go terrible locations. The new properties are given way better location options and are than a box of slots. You'll see these older locations close or cannibalized by updates.

The more modern games of skill such as Gamblit haven't gained much momentum. They're interesting products, but it isn't resonating with customers.

You won't be able to consolidate all of it, but you should be able to consolidate 20k to 40k down to 6% to 12%. Target the highest rate debt to be consolidated. Speak with your bank or explore peer to peer lending options such as lending club.

Either way focus your principle payments on the highest interest rate debt and work down the waterfall.

Unfortunately, you potentially have a big problem on your hands. The sports betting network you are running is a federal crime under the wire act. If prosecuted this can result in mid 6 figure fines and meaningful prison time. 

In addition you've committed multiple counts of felony fraud against your friends. If prosecuted this could carry up to 10 years of prison.

You may also be guilty of other charges for running a book in the eyes of your state.

It is doubtful you're currently being criminally investigated, but you are already down a very high risk low reward path. You need to think very very carefully about your next steps and really should consult a defense lawyer on how to proceed. At the very least you need to end all of this bet taking activity and tactfully work through a settlement with your friends. Your biggest risk of an investigation occurring is one of these wronged friends bringing a fraud claim against you to the police."

Other subjects to explore with your parents, some of which you may have already.

Have your parents applied or are receiving social security disability?

Do they have disability insurance through work that was not obtained? Even though your dad is out for a few years, there may be coverage owed that wasn't applied for.

Your local churches will have resources to help. Do your parents qualify for food stamps? Do you? Is there a local food pantry that can help?

You absolutely have to cut gambling out, it is massively detrimental to your situation. Find a way to put that energy elsewhere and exploring the topics I mentioned in detail is a good place to start.

It is admirable that you are helping your family, but keep in mind you have no legal obligation to do so, granted you may be situationally obligated for housing or other reasons. An extension of getting yourself right is that you need to develop a multi year plan towards your independent life. If in 2 to 5 years your parents aren't gone and you havent taken steps to prepare a plan for yourself, it's going to be a very tough time.

Unless you are a PhD in mathematics, have amazing analytics, and massive scale in a bankroll. You have zero chance at making money gambling, let alone making a living doing it. Even of you are that genius who thinks you can beat the system, you almost certainly can't and certainly can't over an extended period.
