raisedbynarcissists,ffbgaku,t3_esmus9,1579763994.0,KWEEN. I'm so proud of you for standing your ground and calling her out! They're all bark and no fuckin bite and boy does it show
raisedbynarcissists,ffbfz4u,t3_esj7i0,1579763602.0,"Hi I went through something similar 5 months ago. My mom wanted me OUT of the house and when I finally packed she started crying and 'love bombing' me to make me feel bad. It's a typical tactic, confuse your emotions so you don't know how to feel but they somehow make themselves the victim. I known it's hard,but trust me when Insay you will find your mental health and self esteem growing the more time you are away from your Nparent. Don't feel guilty for removing yourself from a bad living situation, you deserve to.live comfortably both mentally and emotionally. And if you want to keep some sort of contact with her that's fine! Just set and maintain clear boundaries for your own well being."
depression,ffanwk6,t1_ffamcma,1579740371.0,"Sorry to hear you faced similar issues! I loved out about 5 months ago and it was the best decision I've ever made. Believe it or not my mental health is better than ever before (even though it's still not great, the move definitely helped alleviate a lot of things)"
raisedbynarcissists,ffafke7,t3_ep1o1c,1579734573.0,"Sorry I'm lurking on ur posts cause everything is SO familiar.  My dad is a very nice guy, my mom is a terror. Alienated him from his friends and he kinda just sat by silently while she emotionally tortured her kids because he knew standing up to her would make her cry crocodile tears. 

To forgive him is ultimately up to you, I know that I personally have a conflicting whether to forgive my dad or not. He never did anything to me but he still sat and watched my mother train us like dogs instead of raising us like kids. He is a victim too, but as the adult I still wish he would have done something, even just stand up to her. It's one of those things where I feel like maybe having a conversation now (if possible) could give some closure."
depression,ffaf1xa,t1_fex3c44,1579734201.0,"Sorry for a late reply! Inwas raised by a very morally conservative mother, taught to be covered at all times and that ""nobody wants to see that"" if I wore a tank top in the summer. Even all my bodily functions had to be held in at all times and inwas basically trained to hide in the bathroom if I even had to burp. This combined with mental illness and constant bullying at school made my self esteem hit rock bottom at a young age. I've had this sense of self hate fostered since birth and it's so hard to break past something you were raised to think/feel. Some days I don't completely hate myself, but its rare"
raisedbynarcissists,ffaee0x,t3_eshgsn,1579733675.0,"God this sounds exactly like my mom . (Hit the nail on the head about manufactured drama) You have to slake their thirst for attention like comforting a screaming toddler. Anything to make them more socially and emotionally palatable, even though it only lasts a short time. They will do anything just to get the spotlight."
raisedbynarcissists,ffae8yu,t1_ffa89o1,1579733564.0,Oof yeah they never change
raisedbynarcissists,ffa449c,t3_es2xzm,1579727501.0,"Yep! I remember having a sudden breakdown at my psychologist appointment and crying about how my childhood was stolen from me and how i still act based off of the robotic training i was raised on. I was an outgoing child and now I'm a nervous, anxiety ridden husk."
depression,fewx9lr,t1_fewvm1u,1579420897.0,Sorry you feel this way too! It's awful and makes you feel small. Sending love and hugs <3
depression,fewx57f,t1_fewukgu,1579420848.0,"I'm sorry you feel this way too, it's the worst and I don't wish it on anybody. Hug gang 2020 I'm sending you one in spirit"
raisedbynarcissists,fesasf2,t1_ferybs2,1579363349.0,"Oops I thought it was a bowel disease lmaoo.
Glad I could get a chuckle out of you, laughter is the best medicine :p"
raisedbynarcissists,ferjh6v,t1_feriv2p,1579354675.0,"I have a few friends from art school in a particular that are very adamant about that as well as the word gypsy being censored as g*psy. I just don't feel like arguing with them so I comply. Perhaps it can seriously trigger bad memories for them when they see the full word spelled? I'm not sure cause I never asked. But yeah I dont really think it makes a difference personally, I just try to be accommodating when I can lol"
AskReddit,feri1se,t3_eq9k9o,1579354149.0,The Sword. Hands down one of my favorite bands EVER. I took a tab of acid for the concert and even on acid they didn't sound particularly fantastic live. Their stage presence was awkward and they sang their songs so differently from the album it was difficult for me and my friend (sober) to sing along.  It wasnt a terrible time but definitely disappointing
raisedbynarcissists,ferh7lj,t1_feqoico,1579353827.0,"Right its wild! My mom also claimed that she just doesn't fart ever. One time I joked that she wasn't fat, it was just all the stored farts. She didn't laugh LMAO

And I'm afraid I dont know what NC means but chronic stomach issues of any kind are the worst and I feel your pain! Glad its eased up for you, it's nice not being married to the toilet lol"
raisedbynarcissists,ferg5vd,t1_ferdwe4,1579353493.0,Sorry it's a force of habit from facebook as I have a few friends that requested i mildly censor it. Though tbh it still reads the same so I'm not sure what actual difference it makes
raisedbynarcissists,feptlvo,t1_fept6io,1579330840.0,"Dude it really makes no sense, like can we just exist without having every aspect of our body and how it functions being scrutinized? Also using ""proper"" words for improper things was a HUGE one and I hated it lol. We never wore underpants it was ALWAYS our *unmentionables*"
raisedbynarcissists,feptigj,t1_fephriy,1579330750.0,"Thanks! My mom did the same thing (ironically we BOTH have IBS.) I totally get the anxiety, it never fully leaves you. Sorry you had to deal with that!"
raisedbynarcissists,fepf783,t1_fepc4tm,1579318994.0,Oh lmao gotcha. It certainly was! Finally free at least lol
raisedbynarcissists,fepb91c,t1_fepawbd,1579316316.0,"Oop sorry this was like a majority vent post so that's why it's kinda long lol!  And no worries I laugh about it too,like how weird to get mad about farts? I've always thought farts were funny so long as they werent coming out of me Haha. I'm mildly relieved to hear my parent isnt the only person who is weirdly controlling of that bodily function,but it's also kinda sad,like just let er rip man"
AskReddit,fep5rlz,t3_eq1wzh,1579312751.0,Lots of money
raisedbynarcissists,fep3pe8,t1_feks35w,1579311440.0,"Ugh that's rough and I'm sorry! Dmaned if you do, damned if you dont. Wish you the best and hope you get out of that situation soon"
SuicideWatch,fej43z3,t3_epe0nv,1579156163.0,"All the time. I get angry when I see pictures of myself as a child, i want to go back in time and beat her or get somebody to snipe her. I despise myself so much and I recieved most of my trauma and emotional abuse around that age, so it's probably why I so vehemently hate that version of me. Maybe it's the same for you? Its dummy unhealthy to feel that way I totally realise,  but; I just do 🤷‍♀️"
AskReddit,fej3jp4,t3_ep1mtj,1579155561.0,"Probably make an fb post saying in dying and not to waste money on a funeral. Give The rights to my illustrations and stories to my friends from college, and then fuck the shit out of my boyfriend"
raisedbynarcissists,fej2jkn,t3_epa2r9,1579154511.0,"This is tough to read because its painfully relatable. It took me a long time to realize how abusive it was. I started standing up to my mother and giving her an actual reason to be upset, and she quickly learned that me minding my business wasnt actually hurting her. I'm sorry you have to deal with a toxic parent, my advice to you is to take back your power, even just a little bit at a time. Say no to her and dont feel guilty , tell her ""we remember things differently"" if she recalls something grossly put of proportion.  The only way to deal with a narcissistic parent is to stand your ground and do good for yourself. You dont deserve to be put through the emotional ringer because she doesnt have her shit together"
SuicideWatch,fehkcwd,t1_feg5pg8,1579118312.0,"Hey I'm sorry to hear that! It's very difficult trying to reach out to a partner that either doesn't want to listen, or just doesnt quite know how. Or in my case, just genuinely can't take hints. I was in a terrible headspace last night but I'm doing a but better now. The desire for suicide comes and goes erratically but I'm hoping to get back to therapy soon. Thanks for your kind words and I hope you are well"
