ADHD,ffnnhjc,t3_eu45yu,1580068180.0,"I get up early, to go to work early... just because I like being done with work by 1:30pm. I can come home and fucking hopefully have enough energy to go do something outside, since there's actually daylight available this way. More likely I am going to lay in bed and read tho. 

People totally understand that I need to be in bed by 8pm this way, tho. When I was working 16hr shifts at a paper mill and had a drive to get there and back, no one understood that I literally couldn't hang out at all. It was only a 2 week job! Get over it."
depression,ffiw01h,t3_etqbpl,1579984044.0,"I moved in with a friend, who then was broken up with in a terrible fashion and she went through a deep, long depression. I took care of cooking, cleaning, I would feed and water her pets, and made sure she was okay. 

Then, when I got depressed, she started acting out against me. I couldn't believe it. She would post pictures of moldy leftover containers on fb when I cleaned SO much old food and a ridiculous amount of dishes when she was depressed without complaining, just understanding. She squirted dishsoap into my water pitcher (that was full of water) and put it back into the fridge. 

I began having some serious suicidal thoughts and I ended up moving out to get away from her. I ended up having to move hours away from my family. I just recently got to go visit them after over a year of being away. I'm incredibly bitter about it.

It really hurts when you go through thick and thin with someone and it was always okay on THEIR end when you were doing the work... Turn things around, and they get toxic! Aggressively so! 

Idk if what you're going through is similar enough that you could block these people (which is what I did) and move on with life to make friends with people who actually support and care about you. Most of my friends are online only... but they give me enough life this way. I hope you can navigate your way around this, and come out for the better."

I just know that the original post got enough backlash that the lady deleted it and felt the need to repost sans the kid, but mentioning pedophiles (*and* her ""naked child"") and the comments were a dumpster fire!

A friend of mine started trying to defend me but quickly dipped out when a breeder said something that indirectly accused him of being a pedo. That alone is beyond unacceptable to me, but if I say anything, they're gonna say it was because I was sexualizing their child... Over and over, a brainless response."
depression,ff065ju,t3_eqs4h8,1579465634.0,"I like the temporary solution to a permanent problem. This really is a permanent problem, that never leaves me with stretches of time in which I'm just okay. It does get better, but only for a little while. My last doctor was actually just straight up with me about that and it was SO refreshing.

I've essentially come to the conclusion that if something else doesn't happen first, I will die by suicide eventually. It's just a matter of how long I can keep finding a reason to keep this fight going. It might be dark, but I'm still here for now, and that's making other people happy.

It's when I can't convince myself that people care that's the scariest."

depression,fcyau83,t3_ejeyfi,1578077333.0,"I think of ""you're not alone"" as ""other people are going through this. You are not the only person going through this. Other people have experienced this pain"" and I don't mean to say that in a "" get over it, other people have"" kind of way. Throughout my depressions, I often feel inhuman and as if I'm the most miserable thing on Earth while that just isn't true. It's helped me, personally, knowing that there's more people going through just this. It's also why I finally think reading books of other people going through depression helps... The way they describe their feelings is uniquely theirs, yet it fits me just the same. 

I've just never taken ""you're not alone"" as a ""I'm here to help you"". People who don't have the severe depression I have, just don't understand what it is I'm going through. And I'm happy they don't. I'm sad knowing there's others doing through it."
adhdwomen,fcwqm2b,t3_ej9u33,1578033772.0,"2019 was the worst mental health year for me too. It started back in 2018, actually, and it was so bad that I moved hours away from my family, whom I love. The move has been a positive change tho.

I still can't really make plans too far ahead. I am excited for some vague gardening plans this spring and summer. 

Instead of wasting this year, I view it as healing from a long abusive relationship I've ended well over 2 years ago now, as well as finally starting to explore the emotional damage my mother inflicted on me in my early childhood, which I've almost completely blocked out. There's a lot of work to be done on me that I've pushed away for too long. I don't think I can be a whole person until I understand things I've gone through"

I've found a cat only vet and I'm so much more comfortable taking my cat there, they actually have compassion towards her, unlike any other vet I've ever taken her to. 

I've had a hedgehog die when we were willing to do anything to get her better, but the exotic vet didn't want to try.

I will say I'm impressed with the vet who helped our ball python after we idiot owners let him to swallow a pair of 11 inch metal feeding tongs. That poor baby.

But the vast majority of vets I've been to just don't seem to care enough about every animal they see. Which is strange because I figure that's why they're vets.."

I also wonder if phrasing it like you never planned on ""leaving"" your family and joining your fiances. Instead you've offered him the opposite... For him to kind of leave his family behind, and join yours."
