worldnews,feo0apx,t1_femvc6p,1579293410.0,Japan work culture need a shift. I think that the work life balance over there is partly to blame. No efficiency with long working hours is not a healthy way to go
pics,fenuzx6,t1_fem3zuc,1579291238.0,try falling and scrapping your knees all the way down into the ocean and then having to hike a few miles back with wet jeans.
AskReddit,fens06w,t1_fenbci1,1579289950.0,As someone who visited New York I enjoy the fast pace. But I'd agree people who just stop suddenly or slow down because something attracted their attention was infuriating. Worst was when I ordered some pizza and decided to walk through time square instead of around it xD
AskReddit,fennrod,t1_feevorj,1579288374.0,I really hate that ending.
offmychest,feiibvz,t1_fehncdv,1579139199.0,"he is like someone I used to know. Give discount left and right, boast about his restaurant and if he is in the store, meal is on him. Lots of ""friends"" would swing by and demand to talk to him just so he can comp their meal. He just wanted the attention. place didn't last too long nor did his so call ""friends"""
offmychest,feihxwe,t1_fehri0b,1579138940.0,man what a piece of work he is. I hope you and your mom are doing well now.
AskReddit,feidwo1,t1_fei3ymz,1579136240.0,Thanks for the read. It is painful to think about... you got to make sacrifice in life sometime so other can live a little more carefree.
AskReddit,fehu191,t1_feggubo,1579123857.0,a wonderful read. Though now I'm asking myself if I have lived a life worth living.
AskReddit,fehsi6r,t1_feh9850,1579122997.0,You have 1 min of pleasure and ruin a person life forever. FK that consent really matter regardless of your selfish reason.
AskReddit,fehrjdj,t3_ep1mtj,1579122450.0,Probably call or text my little sister to tell her to stay strong and be the best person she can be. Then tell a coworker how much I value her friendship and then go find a quiet room pop on some music and drift off.
Whatcouldgowrong,fee5daz,t1_fee3nyy,1579026735.0,ah the rice rocket lol
Whatcouldgowrong,fdffv1k,t1_fdebmuf,1578360725.0,Ya had the same thing happen to me. Worst part is there was a divider with planted tree and he stepped out from the blind spot. Lucky I was able to swerve out of the way or he would have been on a feeding tube. People are so stupid sometime
offmychest,fd0o6ia,t1_fcsnfp1,1578121513.0,that is a very good sign. I hope you went for it and told her. Best of luck and happy new year to you guys.
AskReddit,fcp254n,t1_fcoii8k,1577848153.0,man thats really so sad =/
excel,fcjvkii,t1_fch1zbo,1577706851.0,I know someone who said they are intermediate level in excel and what they and the manager consider as intermediate is being able to copy data into excel and look it up manually. I was quite shock to say the least
tifu,fcjqanb,t1_fcjnjnn,1577699228.0,I'm pretty sure you can call this rape as his girlfriend did not consent to having unprotected sex.
tifu,fcjpymb,t3_ehhwu3,1577698748.0,doesn't matter if your girlfriend is not pregnant. What you did was really stupid  and could have had a major impact on her life. Try thinking with the logical head and not the dumb one for once.
offmychest,fcjki3v,t3_ehfyde,1577691285.0,there's chemistry between you two. take that leap and tell her what you just told us. If she feels the same way it could be the start of something great.
TwoXChromosomes,fcjhplv,t1_fcgxtlj,1577688017.0,"eh no. If your kid behave like that, I would hope that you apologize to the girl and force your kid to do the same. Getting defensive is no excuse to shift the blame from your kid to victim. That is beyond low... I'd rather admit that my parenting was inadequate than trying to defend shitty behavior."
TwoXChromosomes,fcjhcfu,t1_fch1g7b,1577687622.0,seriously I'm still trying to figure out how the hell does the mom think that her son action was ok and then turn around trying to make it seem like it's OP was at fault. It is this kind of thinking that screw up kids =/
personalfinance,fcj5zco,t1_fcj15q6,1577678102.0,ya my brother friend dad went through a similar situation like this. He listen to their sob story and felt bad and wanted to help them out. They ended up trashing the place and party with really loud music. When they were told to evict they didn't and he had to bring in the cops to get them to move out. Now he's more afraid they would try to get revenge so ya I get why you can't believe every sob story.
excel,fc7g63x,t3_egaswa,1577506446.0,man I wish you were my dad lol I would have love to learn all of these

that should pretty much tell you how the voting went lol 
Also interesting 
>The House voted almost entirely along party lines: The House voted 230-197 to charge Trump with abuse of power and 229-198 to charge him with obstruction of Congress. Just two Democrats voted against both articles, Reps. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who is expected to soon switch parties."
