pathofexile,fffyxaz,t3_et8ke1,1579894838.0,I guess he didn’t know he could have used trade macro when you put the item in the window? He could have declined at that point if he wanted.
PathOfExileBuilds,ff7m3ge,t1_ff7kth5,1579652811.0,This is the way.
CFB,fekpnz0,t1_eulvuso,1579205013.0,Ahahaha!
KarmaConspiracy,fei2emu,t1_fehzgr6,1579128786.0,"I think you meant to say “more about you than me.”  Before you have an aneurism, too late, check out other posts in the sub to see what it’s about lol."
GetMotivated,feezmka,t1_feeo7u5,1579044736.0,"Stuck in Little Rock now, I miss the water."
RoastMe,feeiypn,t3_eoi5uc,1579034701.0,The pocket on your shirt is bigger than your breasts.
GetMotivated,feeh2wr,t1_feeg6u2,1579033616.0,"What part of Louisiana? I’m from Morgan City, his accent is nothing compared to many people there. It’s just his natural voice that makes him hard to understand."
GetMotivated,feefikf,t1_fedofl0,1579032701.0,"People that aren’t Cajun thinks Coach O has a crazy accent, he doesn’t. His voice is very scratchy and rough, but his accent is not that bad compared to many Cajuns."
Prematurecelebration,fdtrj54,t3_en25x5,1578721076.0,This was just posted yesterday...
PublicFreakout,fdgm8ho,t3_el3an6,1578402034.0,"If this were in America, the guy trying to break in could probably sue the owner. The owner continued the beating after he was off his property. In my eyes well deserved, but we also let someone sue McDonald’s for serving hot coffee."
Prematurecelebration,fdb47z3,t1_fdax92o,1578253574.0,"No, it's all about your post being shitty for this sub. Where's the people celebrating thinking they have won? Because if you say the fans commenting, like I already said, that's 90% of fans of any team, of any sport, of any game. Calling me the e-hermit when you are the one constantly being the keyboard warrior making personal attacks, good job guy!"
RiseofKingdoms,fdaw44x,t3_ekescz,1578251020.0,It’s happened to me on my iPhone a few times. I have to delete the app/data and then redownload.
Prematurecelebration,fdavyxt,t1_fdacj36,1578250961.0,"That’s damn near every fan ever genius. I like how you try to make it a personal attack, shows just how shitty of a person you are. Did you even read? I said I was glad the Patriots lost, but you asked if I’m a Pats fan? I’m just tired of people like you flooding the sub with shitty posts."
Prematurecelebration,fd8znj1,t3_ekadpj,1578225947.0,"It’s not a celebration, all the time teams are posting hype videos before games. I’m glad the Patriots lost but stop reaching for karma."
JusticePorn,fd2llnc,t3_ejn1u7,1578148959.0,"Oh man please give me more to the story! I want the aftermath, because you know this moron made another video about how he his rights were violated here lol."
Bowling,fcla03j,t3_ehpg1i,1577743043.0,I have one just like it from my father also. 7/15/94 engraved inside the ring from when he bowled his. He passed in 2013. Every Tuesday for league I bring it with me.

RiseofKingdoms,fc6tfnk,t3_egbeei,1577489041.0,This is far and above worth the 7k gems for the extra rewards! Please people spend the gems!
Saints,fc6t6rz,t1_fc5njt2,1577488860.0,"It’s not that the Pats couldn’t salvage him though. Bel and Brady wanted to keep him, but with the allegations, the top dogs had to let him go."
Saints,fbkigxm,t1_fbkd3qy,1576950887.0,"And of course you would take Brady, you are also biased."
