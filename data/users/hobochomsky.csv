AskReddit,ffi8vrj,t3_etohsu,1579968094.0,Guys constantly performing over the top gestures to show their love. I've had multiple relationships end because I wasnt as good as the guy in movies.
CasualConversation,fff0eyo,t1_ffexdtw,1579872195.0,"I was annoyed about the entire situation and the lack of consideration. Even having a third of a beer, which was about 6 oz. spilled directly onto my lap, either warrants an offer to buy a new beer considering it soaked my pants and boxers and made me extremely uncomfortable, or at a very minimum an apology."
CasualConversation,ffe935b,t1_ffe3iat,1579840072.0,Nope. Friends even pointed out he didnt. But way to jump to conclusions.
CasualConversation,ffe90bs,t1_ffe4fy8,1579840007.0,"Fair enough, yeah I was probably a little too annoyed."
CasualConversation,ffe1xq2,t1_ffe0vcw,1579834575.0,Friends say sorry for stuff like that at least
CasualConversation,ffe1kbn,t1_ffe153g,1579834306.0,I mean it's more the fact that it was also onto me. And I think it's at least common courtesy to offer. And even then he could have said sorry.

godtiersuperpowers,fedqpvq,t3_eok38u,1579017835.0,"Does the effect stack, so 3 people ejaculate at once and the effect will last for 4 minutes and 30 seconds? Or just everytime someone ejaculates the timer is reset to a minute and 30 seconds?"
