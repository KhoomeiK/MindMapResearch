ExpectationVsReality,ffi5yuo,t1_ffgb7r0,1579965977.0,"Or for me - Recruiters asking if I want to apply for a job I am way under experienced for. Like no, I would not be suitable for Head of Operations at a company."
fatlogic,ff07giy,t3_eqgo9g,1579466004.0,"I think part of this problem is that being overweight has become “average”. 

An example of this today: My mum is about a stone and a half over weight. Not much but hopefully easy enough to lose. My fiancé said to me “but she isn’t overweight. My mum is the same - she’s normal.” I had to delicately say that both of our mums were a little overweight and not the healthiest weight for them to be. 

Side note: His mum is 58 and mine is 53. My mum is sticking is 1200 calories a day to lose weight and doing lots of long walks and canoeing."
fatlogic,fet598r,t3_eqhfl0,1579371926.0,"Rant: Am hung over - really want to just eat a McDonald’s and lots of chips. 

Rave: Instead made roasted vegetables, couscous and yoghurt for dinner. Got my lazy ass a healthy meal to beat the hang over blues."
britishproblems,fe9pc4z,t3_eo1yjx,1578940292.0,My office moves people around every year or so. This is apparently to encourage people to socialise outside of their group they sit with. It’s very annoying.
fatlogic,fe4a2sn,t3_en8h4h,1578857230.0,"I’m getting bored with my gym routine at the moment, so I’ve had to jazz it up a bit. I’ve moved things around and added some new exercises in. I’ve also switched from listening to music to  my mindfulness/meditation podcasts whilst I do my cardio. It’s made it far more interesting now. 

I’ve marked Friday off a non counting calories day as it’s my birthday. I can’t wait to go to Wagamamas and then go drink cocktails. I’ve been eating well for two weeks so it’s well worth it!"
fatlogic,fduwy0b,t3_en29tf,1578740256.0,Yeah I’m slimmer than I was at 16. I was fat as a teenager and only got fitter in my 20s.
AskReddit,fdq9qs1,t3_emoxsq,1578660459.0,"A couple of things so far:

\- My Dad and my brother haven't talked in 7 years. They don't get along. The lesson I have learnt is that sometimes even family will never get along and they are better off apart.

\- In 2016, I lost an auntie to a sudden heart attack (she was 53), and on 6th Jan this year my uncle succumbed to cancer he had been fighting for 4 years. He was 59. I've learnt that I can my best to stay healthy, but I'm extremely aware that I could drop down dead right now.

Both of these things are hard and scary for me right now."
AskReddit,fdjz1rv,t3_elsvgq,1578491868.0,"In my experience, If I have a guy friend, this is because I only see him as a friend. If I wanted anything else from the relationship, it would have happened. I don't know many people where their friends have become more than friends. 

So, I'd say, get to know her and her hobbies, what everyone else has said BUT if she starts dating someone else that isn't you, chances are she's just not interested."
AskReddit,fdg7dzy,t3_el2az5,1578383089.0,Witcher. I’m down for that. Either way it’s Geralt or Yennifer.
TwoXChromosomes,fd7u52i,t1_fd7e6cd,1578210141.0,Diagnosed with endometriosis at 17 and told my only options were birth control or get pregnant. It was not a hard choice.
TwoXChromosomes,fd4n043,t1_fd4b7sj,1578169069.0,"Yes I’ve been warned about the time it takes to be fully off of them. However, I’m on a progesterone type one and the nurse said one pill literally only lasts 24 hours and after that point I’m fertile again. I hope one day it’s that easy!"
fatlogic,fd3ti5u,t3_ejxofg,1578161501.0,"Loving long walks at the moment - We did a 5.5 mile walk today with my mums dog and plan on doing an 8 mile walk next weekend. 

I’m finding it really relaxing and so nice to visit beautiful, natural places. I’m also loving the nice ache in my legs when you get home!"
TwoXChromosomes,fd3n52r,t3_ejxz5i,1578159878.0,"I’ve been on constant, no break, birth control for ten years now. Some years back my mum told my I should stop because it might be bad not to have a period. I then spoke to my contraceptive nurse who said no, this isn’t a problem. Just come off when you want to get pregnant. My mum still thinks the nurse is wrong."
AskReddit,fcvsqjs,t3_ej0lik,1578009257.0,"No but I discovered how little they cared about me. Within less than a month someone else in another department has replaced me, and was/still is sleeping with my manager. Kick in the f*cking teeth tbh."
badwomensanatomy,fcnlxdr,t1_fcm7k8a,1577814011.0,Yep sprained mine once 5 years ago. The fucker is not what she used to be...
AskReddit,fcmwsd1,t1_fcm4wgs,1577795778.0,"My brother has self-diagnosed himself with PTSD. He uses it all the time for the reason he can't hold down a job or a relationship. I can't ever say to my mum that I think he needs to actually take responsibility for his life and not keep using the PTSD line. She would kill me if I said that. 

He has gone to one lady who, whilst she didn't diagnose him with PTSD, said he had a 'permanently broken heart' that would mean he would always struggle to maintain a relationship. Again, bullshit. 

TL;DR - My brother is using a self-diagnosis of PTSD and heart break to justify why life hasn't gone his way."
AskReddit,fcmwdy3,t1_fcm1wph,1577795302.0,"I take this as a blessing and a curse. The algorithms are so good the products that are shown to me now on Instagram are pretty much always something I really like. Cons: my bank account is sometimes not happy with me.

However, what I find creepy is this: My fiance and I were discussing when we next going to go on holiday to India. When I next played a video on youtube, all the adverts were adverts for travelling to India.

TL;DR - Yes, I am someone who is convinced that our phones are listening."
AskReddit,fckqhzu,t1_fckqg1y,1577731002.0,Yeah because it’s a chutney really - lots of sugar.
AskReddit,fckp87l,t1_fckkc4e,1577730219.0,It’s is good. Terrible for you but very tasty.
AskReddit,fcjyb8d,t3_ehih26,1577710335.0,Cauliflower curry with lots of mango chutney. Makes me very happy.
AskReddit,fcad0b8,t3_egsztr,1577567054.0,Celery. It’s tasteless and pointless. It adds nothing to any dishes and I can’t stand the stuff.
fatlogic,fc6ph64,t1_fc6p8fu,1577486191.0,"Well (and correct me if I’m wrong because this is purely guesswork) maybe it’s to do with dominant arms and the corresponding leg? E.g I’m right handed and so maybe my left leg is the stronger one?

I’m aware of his stupid this sounds btw."
fatlogic,fc6ny0e,t1_fc6mkri,1577485101.0,Well probably - I’m going to keep working on it. Its like my right hip is just ‘tighter’ than the left hip. I only mention genetics because my mum and gran have the same issue!
fatlogic,fc6jq7i,t3_egc9c3,1577482218.0,"Rave: Managed to keep control at Christmas and not completely eat everything in sight. Especially hard with all the mulled wine being made which is delicious. 

Rant: Yoga is being a bitch at the moment. For some reason my left hip is far more flexible than my right hip so some poses are just impossible. I’m putting it down to genetics as two years of yoga isn’t working."
AskReddit,fc5u9wb,t1_fc5ijj0,1577466029.0,"Exactly this. There’s a guy at my gym who uses the leg press. He will do three reps, then sit for close to 10 minutes in his phone, then repeat. No joke, I came back half an hour later and he was still there.  Very irritating."
AskReddit,fc5av3v,t3_efz98e,1577451497.0,"Imminent infertility for all humankind. Basically, Children of Men."
AskReddit,fburmw8,t1_fburcbm,1577119264.0,"Well I’m 27 now and we would like to start a family when we are in our thirties - so 3/4 years time ish? 

I had excision surgery when I was first diagnosed at 17. It certainly helped for a short while! My other concern is that when you have endo pain, you obviously don’t want to have sex. Which would be a major problem in trying for a baby."
