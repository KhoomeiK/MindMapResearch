politics,ff7w9dw,t1_ff6pwm5,1579659857.0,"Right ? I would lose my quality of life entirely. It's not just, go without money for a while until I find another similar job.... I have put in fucking time to get to my hourly rate where I am. I am being paid more in my position at this company because of hard work and because the company values loyalty. The same position anywhere else would pay me much, much less."

dogs,ff06ml4,t1_ff02vcl,1579465717.0,"No real trick to it, but make sure it is real butter. Margerine, etc, can't be kept room temp. I've never had this issue and I've used Kroger Brand butter, and lately I've been treating myself to kerry's Irish gold. I don't keep em in an air tight container, just a porcelain butter dish from Target. I live in the humid AF south and we can't convince our landlord to insulate our house to save our lives. 

Maybe there's something contaminating the inherited butter container ?"
dogs,few5pmq,t1_few5jgc,1579405772.0,"Hahaha, plus, it'll probably be the best talking piece in your house."
dogs,few43xl,t1_fevqnqw,1579405081.0,"Lmao, make a small floating shelf for your butter. I understand, I also keep my butter at room temp and having only fridge butter would be unacceptable. Just make a small shelf right near the counter or right above the counter to store the butter on when you aren't using it. Buy a nice picture frame and make sure to put a photo of your dog in it. Keep this on the shelf next to the butter to honor the dog's love. It's pretty much the only way."

You've probably got good odds and most exxons."

Also, did you expect to learn that the masses want to bone your dad?"
