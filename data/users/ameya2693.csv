We are in the middle of a civil war, you idiot. Look around you at the violence and state of affairs in India. It is slow progress *because* Muslims hamper the growth of India, *at every fucking step*. 

Aadhar to give everyone identification? Muslims out in full force against it.

CAA to give persecuted minorities from neighbourhood which doesn't affect Muslims of India? Let's burn houses, public buildings because it doesn't include Muslim sects.

AMUSU President has already threatened violence across India because he doesn't want Bangladeshi illegal aliens to be identified and sent back. I wouldn't be surprised if he is one of them tbh.

So, fuck open-mindedness. These people need to shown the door and then thrown out of it and anyone who even thinks about supporting the rights of such bigots needs to be thrown out as well.

SeriousConversation,ffgh2mp,t3_etbsh9,1579906073.0,"> But I am about to graduate soon, and despite having a good track record, I have been facing many job rejections. When I asked around my old friends from other colleges in the same major, I realised that they have already surpassed me, for example doing more internships, having learnt more skills and projects under their belt etc. It is a very very competitive and fast-paced industry that we are in. Not to say that I haven't been working hard, but perhaps in the wrong directions. All these sudden realizations and other setbacks in life despite pushing myself hard resulted in a mental breakdown recently.

> When I see my other bunch of friends who are always taking life easy and goofing off playing games, I'd always chide them for not doing something to upgrade themselves. Don't they fear competition in the workforce? It is a pretty competitive country where I come from. Given my health situation, everyone has been telling me to take it easy and settle for easier jobs.

Firstly, I was the friend on the other side of my group circle. So, take what I say with a pinch of salt. My thought process from the beginning has been that I do not want to work all my life. It's not something that interests me and it will never happen. Ok, but I still need money like everyone else to survive right? So, what can I do which will: 

a) give me enough money to live a semi-luxurious lifestyle (not flying first class once a year, just you know having the ability to have a unique experience every year and these can cost a decent amount of money.)

b) provide enough income that I can sustain living in a city I like (I currently have a couple of places in mind already)

Okay, so with that in my head, I focused on exactly what I need to do to achieve these goals. If it means I have to work hard and save etc *now* then I will do that. 

I think what you are suffering from, and you can completely ignore me if I am talking bollocks, is a final goal that you want to achieve. I am not talking career goals like becoming a CxO or becoming a co-founder of a hedge fund or a tech unicorn or something, I am talking about something that is emotional to you and it can be these things but usually, emotions do not have specific goals. They go towards ideas and feelings. Do that. Figure out exactly what you want emotionally. After this, you will be able to chart a path towards it. 

A career is a journey and a marathon. Forget what people get on Day 1. Its where they are 5-10 years down the line that matters.

And try to relax. It does you no good being constantly switched on. Your brain will get tired. Make sure you sleep well and enjoy a night out to listen to music you enjoy etc. Life is about living.

Govts have to invest in infrastructure which keeps a circular economy in mind. This is a must. Without it, everything we do will not be enough. 

Companies have to stop their malpractice behaviour and start adhering to some basic standards. Exploitation of poor countries with lax regulations is the sole reason for extreme environmental degradation. If a company exports to the west, then it's production must match western standards, in every way. This would deplete the capability of companies to grow larger than countries and thus completely overwhelm their polity. This undermines the ability of poor countries to have any bargaining power over a company like Nestlé. 

We gotta start eating different. Seriously, this meat every day fad has to go. We cannot efficiently feed a planet of 10 billion meat every day. It's not feasible. Alternative fake meats sound interesting but will remain niche. We need to look at different plant sources such as spirulina. This marine microscopic organism is one of the few edible species of marine plants rich in nutrients and the best part is that they can be attached at the end of a sewage treatment plant to remove the excess nitrates and phosphates. 

There are many solutions and we need a combination of them all, from smart roads to green energy generation to nuclear power to energy efficient infrastructure to building more vertical cities to air scrubbers in cities to minimise dust pollution to more public transport options to electric cars to shared autonomous cars in cities. 

That's just tip of the iceberg. We haven't started discussing how going off grid is easier than ever before and developing local and remote energy production and storage solutions will ease burden on mainline grids.

Just to add further, there are companies even looking to providing people with the ability to invest based on their personal values. This is another key idea we need to have. The sole reason why major companies refuse to do anything is that their investors and customers are not going away. If and only if they walk away, will these companies change their practices. 

That said, govts can certainly do more encourage it. Though, this means that govts have to do work and, let me be frank in saying that no politician has done any serious work in over a decade.

As the oceans become warmer, they will transport less heat and nutrients to the poles, this will reduce the natural churn and distribution which takes place across the oceans. So, nutrients will result in mega blooms of various microscopic marine life which will kill organisms in the area because they will block all sunlight to the surface. This also depletes the life at the poles since they no longer get the nutrients they need to survive because the currents have stopped. 

After all of this, as the ocean life dies out (by this time land life has been extinct already since land animals will be dead once the last dregs of water have evaporated off the surface) you will get the release of H2S (Hydrogen Sulphide) which is a highly toxic gas which when released in high enough concentrations in water, under pressure, will react to form Sulphuric Acid killing what little has survived till that point.

Once this is done, the Earth will go into a rebalancing period where the environmental degradations done by humanity get scrubbed clean and once more life starts over from the top i.e. we repeat everything from the Cambrian Explosion and onwards because the only tool life uses to remember what it did before is DNA and if that is gone, then, it has to start all the fuck over again.

This was in response to the United States sending a Carrier Battle Group towards India. You might know this already but this is to provide the context that India did not choose to become ""non-aligned"", it was made to do so by another republic to support of a military dictatorship."
IndiaSpeaks,fez05b5,t1_feyv4pu,1579452626.0,"Yes, fighting a country with puny army is a war. What the Americans call war is a pathetic excuse. Americans have never seen a real war. Their wars are fought on TV screens. The fact they couldn't beat a bunch of desert dwellers just proves that the Americans have no will to fight. On Eurasia, you have no choice but to fight. We do not have the luxury of the Americans and the ABCDs of NA to long for ""world peace^TM "". In a war, it will be the Asians and Europeans who will slaughter each other until the Amerifats decide that they have picked their side and claim victory at the end of it all.

Peace is won by blood and iron. The sooner you accept it, the better it will be for you. A war is coming, you better stay on the sidelines or at least get the fuck out of the way. The reason I say this is because without a war, the UN will never accept new members on the Security Council. Until it is proven that the UK and Russia and others are unable to maintain the global peace they got rich off, India will not sit on the council. The UN will *never*, *never* accept a nation from the Global South. Accept it. They will never let us on unless we fight our way into the council. Japan fought in the WW1 aiding the Brits and they did not even get equal status on the table, leading them to leave the negotiations midway through. And you think they'll just reform the council and let us in? Our economy has been bigger than Russia for years and we are now as big as France and UK, yet our chances to get on the UNSC remain slim, *at fucking best*. 

Is your brain so small that it refuses to see what I am seeing? That without war, we have no chance of sitting in a position to make decisions. Or maybe that is what you want? You want India to remain behind hoping that one day^TM the great powers will just let us in, like that pansy fucker Nehru.

> So you want people to die basically.

In the defence of Bharat and our Republic, death is but a passing thought."
IndiaSpeaks,fexjs91,t1_fex2dgh,1579432125.0,">War never solves anything. 

War allows you to create a hierarchy of powers. It allows a nation which previously had little say in global affairs to take a bigger role. The two world wars sealed America's rise to global leadership. Anyone with half a brain could see that coming. 

Wars are brutal, wasteful of lives, money and resources but they are useful to reset the board and set up the next game in your favour. A war will see India rise to great power status if we have capable leaders instead of pansy idiots like you who just want ""world peace^TM "". 

Peace is won by blood and war, not through fancy diplomacy. Fancy diplomacy aims to avoid war or at least delay it. A war can be delayed but not denied. Tensions are already rising across the world today and we are reaching the conclusion that war is the only way to fix it."
