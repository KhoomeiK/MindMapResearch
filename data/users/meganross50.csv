oregon,ffg55qs,t1_ffg2c75,1579898682.0,"I don’t think most of it is on purpose.  Of course there’s racist people everywhere you go but in my age group most of it is unintentional from what I’ve seen living here.  My high school in southern Oregon had a high population of Hispanics and islanders so I grew up used to that, but there was only like 3 black people in the 1,500 student population.  When I moved to Colorado I became best friends and eventually dated a black guy and he always made fun of me how we first met because I was nervous and super weird around him.  Honestly, it was because I was young and had hardly any experience with black people and didn’t want to “make a social mistake”....I didn’t give a fuck he was black, I don’t consider myself a racist....it was just a new experience I wasn’t used to.  Now I’ve grown and realized we’re all the same but not everyone has had that epiphany yet....you know what I mean?  

I wouldn’t worry so much about moving to Oregon.  If you want to do it, do it! I love it here.   There’s so much to offer and each city offers a unique experience so you can find whatever it is you’re looking for!"
oregon,ffg232d,t3_etffym,1579896786.0,"Born in Oregon and spent most of my life here.  I’m white and most of the population is white.  I’ve witnessed blatant racism but honestly most of it is just from ignorance.   Mainly due to people only being around white people their whole lives.  You know the “wow, can I touch your hair?” kind of thing towards black people sort of stuff is what I mainly see.  Kinda racist but mainly just curiosity and ignorance rolled in to one."

bipolar,ffaxsma,t1_ffawtyf,1579746971.0,"That’s a good idea...the only problem is I have been pretty unstable for the last few months and am pretty sure I need a psychiatrist to help me adjust my meds - which I was doing with the interim psych - but now he’s gone and I don’t know what to do.  I guess a PCP is better than nothing though.  Now that I’m thinking about it though, I guess maybe this is my chance to try and go off meds.  Since I’ve gotten sober about a year ago I don’t really feel bipolar anymore....honestly I think I just have depression now that cocaine isn’t stimulating manic episodes.  I still have a therapist which is good....I just went from pure panic to excitement to experiment on my own I guess."
bipolar,ffax8jn,t3_eskovp,1579746601.0,"Just give him the facts.  I was diagnosed bipolar a couple years ago, all that time I was using a lot of drugs and drinking heavily.   I got completely sober about a year ago and have only experienced depression since.  I have been on meds some of that time but mainly off - though I always told her I was taking them.  The depression was intense but I have never again experienced a mania.  I finally let her know and she is open to the idea that maybe drugs played more of a part in my mental illness than organic brain chemistry did.  We’re going to do a trial run on no meds and see what happens for a while - how long I have no idea.  She said antidepressants may be a better fit for me than meds for bipolar if I stay stable (or just depressed)."

bipolar,ffa8niv,t3_esel46,1579730029.0,It is my understanding that 400 mg is the max dose and it’s the highest I’ve ever been on.  Adult dosing of any med does not usually take into account weight or body mass - that’s pretty much exclusive for pediatric doses.  I would question that dose or question if you understood the med correctly when they told you.
bipolar,ffa6h36,t3_es7hxh,1579728817.0,"How do you sort? I sort by new not popular and there’s way more posts asking for advice and help or just venting than there is art or whatever you dislike.

bipolar,ff4cbk7,t1_ff4awo2,1579560257.0,"I’m kind of confused by your post.  It sounds like you go from one med to another....not off of meds completely?  If you’re just switching meds it’s reasonable to believe that the new med is preventing episodes.  And it does sound like you’re having mild episodes when you stop them? Like I said, I’ve stopped meds cold turkey (totally med free, not just changing meds) and it could take up to a month or more before I slipped back into an episode - mania or depression.  Latuda is for bipolar depression, not for mania, so if you went into a hypomanic episode that was likely from stopping lithium.  We’re you taking any other meds with the latuda?  I’ve never heard of latuda being a first line, only med treatment approach."

bipolar,ff0dn0y,t3_eqzb5j,1579467927.0,"I’ve been there my friend.  I made it through too and after the attempt was the most confusing, most difficult experience.  I was so lost.  Grateful I lived, but also extremely angry I didn’t succeed.  I went to inpatient for a week.  It helped me stabilize but I wouldn’t say it was extremely helpful.  The time after getting out was the hardest and it lasted for a long time.  Talking with my psychiatrist and therapist has been the most helpful.  Reflecting and writing about what led up to it was helpful too.  I’m still confused by it all but it’s getting better.  A part of me wants to try again honestly, but the hurt my family and friends experienced won’t let me do it.  You are important in this world and things can get better.  I hope you find a stable place."

bipolar,feze5w3,t3_equ2gq,1579456433.0,"Be honest!  When I saw my first psychiatrist I was really timid and it wasn’t helpful.  I would lie about symptoms, she would prescribe meds and they would have side effects so I would quit them and tell her I was taking them instead of just letting her know and switching.  Your psychiatrist works for you to find what works best for you.  In turn though you have to be a good patient and be open and honest."

bipolar,fepswnf,t1_feoxpif,1579330155.0,After I attempted suicide I continued to think about killing myself for weeks.  I went off it cold turkey.  It was miserable but I finally came out of it....I don’t know how long that took.  I never had physical withdrawal symptoms.  I went from 1350mg to 0mg over night.  I don’t know what the right way to go about it is.  I do t think there is one.  I think it will suck no matter what.
bipolar,feoqf1m,t3_eq6jyv,1579303942.0,"I took lithium for two years but became too scared of the damage it can have on your body.  It helped with my mania but no so much the depression though it did greatly decrease my suicidal thoughts....so I guess it did help in a way.  I won’t go back on it because I enjoy my kidneys and thyroid too much and don’t want to start shaking.  I’ll take manageable weight gain with other meds rather than killing my organs.   Also, getting off lithium is the most horrible experience.  I fell into the deepest dark place and tried to kill my self two weeks later and I’ve read many stories of others doing the same thing."

bipolar,fenc089,t1_fenacqm,1579281441.0,It’s the same idea as when you have food poisoning or an intestinal infection.  You never want to take Imodium because your body needs to expel the bacteria.   If you take Imodium it just sits in there.  Diarrhea is the body’s natural defense and disrupting it with Imodium is not wise.
bipolar,fena74h,t1_femikhh,1579280321.0,No! Do not take imoduim for lithium diarrhea!  It’s how your body expels the lithium when you’ve taken too much.  You need to get it out.  I had an acute overdose and had horrible diarrhea and the hospital gave me meds to make me poop even more.  DO NOT take imodium if you’ve taken too much lithium to the point it gives you diarrhea.  If you take Imodium the extra lithium just sits in your bowels and doesn’t get out of your body.
bipolar,femec4x,t3_eptji9,1579251085.0,"I haven’t figured out a happy medium either.  I went off my meds in December and spiraled.  I attempted suicide two weeks ago.  I’m lost and confused.  I’m in a horrible depression but don’t like the idea of meds.  Although they helped control intense moods, they left me feeling empty inside.  I was numb to day to day emotions.  I didn’t cry for almost two years on meds.  In that two years my beloved grandma and my favorite dog died....I felt nothing.  I fantasize about death everyday but I feel like feeling this way is better than not feeling at all.  I don’t know what to do.

Been off it for two months and I now experience the whole range of emotions again.  It feels good to feel again.  The story is not all good though.

bipolar,fe75l99,t3_enyux4,1578910347.0,You got this! If you’re worried about 3 12s maybe just work two?  The pay is awesome (I’m an LPN and only make $23) so you have some room to get back into the work force slowly.  I used to work 3 12s and it’s pretty exhausting by that third day.  Really listen to your body and if working that much is proving to be difficult definitely decrease your hours.  Working less and making a little less money is better than a stay in the psych ward!

I look back and think what I could have done differently.  I could have done a lot.  I didn’t do anything to get myself better.  I isolated and quickly got worse and worse.  I wish I would have forced myself outside for a walk, ate some fruits and veggies, called the crisis line.  I wish I had done something, anything.  Hang in there.  It’s up to you to get better.  I acknowledge that it’s our brain chemistry but we can take control and make it better, if even just a little bit.  Go to school tomorrow and try to be positive.  Put that fake smile on your face and drudge through it.  Maybe park a ways from your class and get a walk in.  Clear your mind.  You can absolutely do this.  We lose sight of the future when we’re in this state but it’s just our mind playing tricks on us.  People to have stable, fulfilling lives with this disease and you can too.  It’s up to you to try.  Talk to your doc and therapist and be totally honest with them and see if how they can help and make the effort on your part to live a healthier life.  I believe in you!"

When I lost my insurance I switched over there and have been much happier with my care there and it’s super cheap.

bipolar,fe46vk7,t1_fe40uul,1578856329.0,My most common complaint for Keppra is the first week or two after starting it.  A lot of people complain of being more tired and a little mentally foggy.  A few say their mood became a little volatile at the start.  Most people say the side effects wore off after that first week or two and both those on it for seizure control and for bipolar say their mood improved after getting used to it.  I’ve never tried it so I don’t have first hand experience but I have thought about it a lot.  If in the future if I need to make a med change I would try it if my doc thought it was appropriate.

bipolar,fe39up5,t3_enkuzx,1578847313.0,I was diagnosed several years ago with bipolar.  I was using a lot of meth and cocaine and thought that was the cause of my mania/depression.  I was put on meds and I went on and off of them constantly and would get swung into a manic episode followed by a depressive episode.  About two years ago I stopped them completely for the same reason....I was an emotionless zombie.  Since I’ve stopped them I haven’t had a manic episode (except for the one that immediately followed me stopping them).  I continue to have severe depressive episodes but since stopping stimulants and medication I don’t have mania.  I’m still diagnosed bipolar but I’m pretty sure I’m actually just struggling with depression and maybe some border line personality disorder.  I’ve recently brought this up to my doc and she said she feels the same but since I won’t take meds she said who really cares what your diagnosis is.

My relationships we unstable and my mind was a mess and I didn’t know how to fix it.  It took a long time of med adjustments and psychotherapy and DBT but I’m doing better now.  Things aren’t perfect but I recover quicker and episodes are less intense.  I don’t have a lot of friends but the ones I do are loving and supportive and that’s something I haven’t experienced in a very long time.  I have attempted suicide and I have self harmed and thought I could never make it past 25.  I’m 31 now and look back and feel so much pain for the old me and so much compassion for the new me.  Just keep going and keep trying.  After each suicide attempt I was always told it was selfish and cowardly.  I realize now it was about control.  I felt my life and symptoms were out of my control and suicide was my ultimate control.  But you can have control in other ways, but it takes work.  Going to treatment, taking meds, finding a good doc and therapist and being a good, open patient, eating well, getting some exercise, getting outside, finding a hobby can be your control in life.  Don’t let this disease own you.  You own you and do all you can to find happiness.  I believe in you."
bipolar,fdygb3a,t1_fdye2nh,1578779518.0,I think you just saved my life at this moment.  I have never thought to look at it this way.  I’ve always just been told suicide is cowardly and selfish.  I cannot express my gratitude I feel for you and taking the time to respond to me.  I feel so lost but I’m feeling hopeful now.  I’ve always known I need to make some changes in my life but never felt like they were going to actually do anything.  But I want control and I have to at least try.  Thank you so much for your words.
bipolar,fdy5w48,t1_fdy4xec,1578776451.0,I’ve gotten to the point where I’m not worried I won’t get through a cycle....I know things get better....it’s the fact that it will happen again.  And I can’t keep living from cycle to cycle.
BipolarReddit,fdy453s,t1_fdy36ms,1578775916.0,Weirdly my blood pressure didn’t drop that much.  My pulse was super low though.  I took 400 mg of seroquel first then started downing bottles.  I basically don’t remember most of the next two days after ODing.  I do remember some weird hallucinations at first then being taken to the ER by EMTs then basically nothing for a few days.  Not painful or scary at all.  I think you would need something like 6 grams or more for it to work though.
trashy,fdy1j75,t3_enbfmb,1578775054.0,Kinda dumb corral set up TBH.  Usually they’re not pushed behind another parking spot....the entrance is usually to the road (or whatever you call it in a parking lot).  I’m sure people do that all the time there.
bipolar,fdy0epn,t3_en3xiq,1578774724.0,"Just diagnosed with BPD a few days ago.  Been diagnosed bipolar for several years.  Was diagnosed by an old male psychiatrist in the psych ward with BPD....but don’t totally agree with it.  Typically I despise old male psychiatrists - most specifically the white ones.  Find them very “I know best and you’re just a dumb patient”.  Sure, I relate to some aspects of BPD, but can’t we all?  Was looking for a sub to see if I fit the diagnosis."
oregon,fdxv6nj,t1_fdxrdvu,1578773249.0,I was just going to say the same thing.
BipolarReddit,fdx3to8,t3_en8z70,1578765015.0,Went off lithium two weeks ago....OD’d on 4 grams of propanolol a week later.  Probably only survived because I missed a whole bottle that was another 1.2 grams.  I’m determined to not go back on it but I still feel like shit after a week in the looney bin.
bipolar,fdsdtkn,t3_emz7tk,1578700382.0,I was literally just thinking about posting something just like this.  I feel like since I got my official diagnosis I’ve just gotten sicker.  It’s like at first it gave me an excuse to be crazy and now I love the craziness....I can’t imagine having it any other way now.  I just got out of the psych ward yesterday for an overdose and do t have any remorse really.  I love being crazy....even when it causes the greatest pain.
bipolar,fcysm2d,t3_ejhea2,1578086196.0,Let you doc know about what’s going on.  If he/she is a good psychiatrist they will work with you to find something new.  I have gone off my meds completely by either tapering or cold turkey and have had a suicide attempt or hospitalization each time.  Different meds work differently on different people and there’s a lot of meds to be tried...talk with your doc and find something that works with you to stabilize and reduce symptoms.  Be patient as you explore new meds.  Psychiatry is a guessing game and it may take some time to find the right combo.
bipolar,fcyrh3u,t1_fcypkdx,1578085534.0,Half lives are the same from body to body.  It will get out of your system as fast as anyone else.  You’ll have some nights of restless sleep likely but in a few days it will be outta there and you’ll be fine.
bipolar,fcypms7,t3_ejkjrq,1578084525.0,Have you had your thyroid and kidneys checked?
bipolar,fcypfop,t3_ejkqcr,1578084416.0,I only take seroquel when in a manic or depressive episode.  I usually take 400 mg to start.  When I snap out of the episode I break the 400 in half to 200mg.  I do that for a few days then go to 100mg.  Do that for a few days then go down to 50.  Do that for a few days then stop.  I usually have trouble sleeping for a day or two or three after stopping but then I get back into my regular schedule.
