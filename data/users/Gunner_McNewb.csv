GameDeals,fezefnp,t1_fez854w,1579456506.0,When they get to Witcher 3 level combat I think their sales might improve a bit. And I'll actually play. I have Mars War Logs and Technomancer and I really have trouble getting into them. I won't even try Bound by Flame. They're all in the same boat as Piranha Bytes games as far as combat. I'd almost swear the same exact people worked for both developers.
GameDeals,fezaedn,t1_fex9bdm,1579455324.0,"I have to say I'm pretty happy about this. I used to get bundles regularly, but really haven't in the last year or two."
GameDeals,feyol8v,t1_fexblmm,1579448361.0,That sums up all of their games. But they usually have somewhat crappy combat too.
ProRevenge,few22vp,t3_eqqnle,1579404402.0,"Wait, so about how many stories have you told in this sub?

You might just be evil if it has been a lot."

DnD,fedlaa9,t1_fedkdbr,1579014331.0,"I was mainly asking because I felt like it should probably be here in the post somewhere.

I like it, but I can't really make an offer. I'm sure as the day goes on you'll find a buyer.

I know work like this is time consuming, so I think it's reasonable to ask a decent price, around 40 or 50."

worldnews,fedjqgv,t1_fedj0vs,1579013264.0,"People ask me where I get protein from fairly often. To the point I did an entire article on it when I was a journalism student in college. I probably get *more* protein than the average person, even though I don't eat meat. Of course, a lot of it comes from cheese, though. Rice, nuts, legumes, and Boca products are major sources as well."
