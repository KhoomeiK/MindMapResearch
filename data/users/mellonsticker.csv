NintendoSwitchDeals,ffpfgx5,t3_euhi7v,1580093740.0,But they’re so far away :/
AskReddit,ffp8l0l,t1_ffp7xdr,1580088913.0,What are your favorite species from the Future is Wild?
AskReddit,ffp8fgc,t1_ffp7xdr,1580088807.0,"Squibbon has this weird charm to it, it’s hard to describe but I see it as a cat and octopus fused together, but can walk on land. Spitfire Birds look really cool, and they’re a species of humming bird but upgraded."
AskReddit,ffp7fmg,t1_ffp7asi,1580088118.0,"SQUIBBON!!!!!

Spitfire Birds come in at a close 2nd."
AskReddit,ffp73cg,t1_ffp6sch,1580087882.0,"The cartoon was pure fire, loved the opening theme! The documentary it was based off of wasn’t bad though"
cats,ffp6n7e,t3_eub0c2,1580087564.0,He’s so angry but the fluffiness cancels it out
AskReddit,ffp6l9b,t3_eub0cz,1580087526.0,"Anyone ever heard of “The Future is Wild”?

If so, then you know how screwed they are unless they can quickly pin point the issue and resolve it without needing new parts."
Showerthoughts,ffp6g9u,t3_eub0i6,1580087428.0,How evolved do you think the “potential” life on Mars got? They’d have to have been around for billions of years minimum to reach that stage.
Showerthoughts,ffp6c9c,t3_eub0x5,1580087348.0,It’s the terrible cycle of life
NintendoSwitch,ffp6ama,t1_ffonsd9,1580087315.0,Thanks for such a detailed answer
MarioKartTour,ffnz33m,t1_f1h2p17,1580072488.0,"Gyro on Mobile is the best way to play a racing game though. I agree that being able to use a Joy Con would be epic, but at that point I’d just play Mario Kart 8 on my Switch. Far less effort and more comfortable."
MarioKartTour,ffnyvck,t1_f1g2lji,1580072406.0,"I mean, that would be pretty epic, but no one expects that level of polish and creativity for a mobile game. I’m fine with them simplifying the game, but the controls are too awkward to full enjoy it."
MarioKartTour,ffnymiz,t1_f1fr5xz,1580072327.0,"Yea, I uninstalled it because I can’t get past how awkward it is vertically when turning."
MarioKartTour,ffnygm9,t1_f1eysep,1580072253.0,"FACTS!!

It’s too stiff on my iPhone and drifting is awkward as heck when I’m trying to turn. I’ll just stick with regular ole Mario Kart on the Switch."
MarioKartTour,ffnxlsl,t1_f1gm60f,1580072060.0,I tried it out on what I assume was 20cc?? The speed was terrible but they have increments. The controlling is pretty terrible though.
MarioKartTour,ffnx4gl,t1_f1goksm,1580071875.0,"Probably is, feels very stiff to me, I’m using a iPhone SE"
MarioKartTour,ffnwr81,t3_d90pc1,1580071753.0,"The fact that Gyro isn’t even default is atrocious, plus it’s vertical rather than horizontal. 

I was expecting fluid controls but nope, this is terrible. Even with gyro + swipe steering, it’s a mess. Not enjoyable enough to make it worth the effort."
gachagaming,ffnwc6c,t1_f1fso5a,1580071578.0,"No one’s saying it should be free. We know the days of free loot are long gone. But paying $4.99 per month for what they give you is outrageous. I’m more annoyed with how sloppy the controls are. I can’t get into it, and this is coming from someone who’s a causal gamer."
gachagaming,ffnv4g9,t1_f1el8nw,1580071258.0,The worst part is it’s so bad it doesn’t even get you interested in playing Mario Kart on other platforms. It’s doing the complete opposite of what Pokémon Go and Pokémon Let’s Go did.
gachagaming,ffnuwt8,t1_f1e7b5x,1580071171.0,"I don’t think asking $10, for Mario Run is the issue. The problem is they didn’t offer enough to convince us of why we should pay it. However, I will argue that $10 for the entire game is far better than a $4.99 month subscription with Kart Tour. That’s highway robbery."
gachagaming,ffnuhmt,t1_f1eayyh,1580070997.0,"Gyro for a mobile racing game is pretty much standard. There’s no reason not to have it any other way, especially for Mario Kart on a phone or tablet."
unpopularopinion,ffntr88,t1_f1isaax,1580070703.0,"I never would have tried it if it weren’t for my cousin. Downloaded it and gave it a chance. Controls are pure garbage. Why is the game vertical and not horizontal? 

I don’t mind the loot boxes, that’s pretty much a stable of mobile games, but the fact that 200cc is locked behind a subscription is absolutely criminal."
NintendoSwitch,ffjgba0,t1_ffgs517,1579997641.0,What happens if I charge a lithium battery while it’s below 0C?
NintendoSwitch,ffjfv9w,t1_ffjc24l,1579997375.0,I thought I was the only one slightly annoyed by this. I don’t turn it off often but I get your point.
NintendoSwitch,ffjfgai,t1_ffj197u,1579997126.0,You say that but Nintendo has no problems blacklisting a Nintendo Account/Switch over chargebacks.
AskReddit,ffgsgnr,t3_et34ph,1579913896.0,"Probably after 4-5 uses. Typically when I go to wash any type of pants, I toss all the jeans and anything else related into the laundry."
VisiblePartyPay,ffdzefr,t3_et3n4a,1579832739.0,"I’d join your party but I’m still stuck trying to Transfer my # from AT&T. Once that finishes, I can activate my account."
VisiblePartyPay,ffdzbt3,t3_et3n4a,1579832686.0,Lol my last name is Alexander
VisiblePartyPay,ffb5auq,t3_esnlwp,1579752178.0,"So.... I can’t send the request until I activate the service, but my # is still porting over. :("
VisiblePartyPay,ffb484x,t3_esnlwp,1579751369.0,"Sending a request now, I’m in this for the long haul"
Showerthoughts,ff896hi,t1_ff88i5s,1579669686.0,"Ahhh, I see.

Yeah I’m probably emotionally nearsighted to a degree then. But that’s not nearly as bad as being actually nearsighted."
Showerthoughts,ff883jh,t3_erq3c2,1579668724.0,It’s a curse I’m forced to live with
Showerthoughts,ff881lb,t3_erq3yf,1579668676.0,Emotional what now?
cats,ff87maa,t1_ff5bcsr,1579668306.0,"Most cats probably wouldn’t respond too well with aggressive play, but it depends on the cat. A few cats that are a bit more on the aggressive side actually enjoy it."
