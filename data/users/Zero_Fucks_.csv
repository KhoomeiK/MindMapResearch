These articles match my views because they are medical fact. You're not going to find any reputable source that refutes the fact that there's no evidence that sex can permanently alter the tightness of a vagina. 

Your ""logical"" points are not as logical as you think. Low muscle tone is hypotonia. Provide research or a reputable source that says sex can induce hypotonia in the vaginal muscles. It is possible that anal intercourse can dilate and eventually stretch the internal and external anal sphincters leading to damage of these structures. Ok, but the vaginal muscles are not sphincters- so provide evidence that sex can permanently stretch the vaginal muscles and lead to damage of their structure. 

You made the claim- you have the burden of proof. If you can find any research that sex can alter the tightness of a vagina feel free to post it. Otherwise don't bother- I'm not interested in your theories because you're not a doctor and you have no research to back your position up."

I actually don't a lot of free time today, so what I've done is use literally 30 seconds to gather these resources from Google explaining what you asked. Some sources more reliable than others, but they all say the same thing.

>You can have a doctorate in almost anything since they give Ph.D's out like candy for almost everything these days.

Where? And how? To get a PhD you need to contribute original research to the field, create a substantial and detailed thesis which involves collating and critically evaluating previous studies/ theories, justifying your choices in methodology and interpreting your results. You then have to get grilled by 2 experts in that field where they pick holes in your thesis and ask you explain your reasons for your choices and your understanding of the topic. They'll apply your findings to other fields and theories also and you'll need to explain on the spot how your research relates or does not relate to them. You have to know your topic inside out and that includes critical evaluation of the research in your area. If you just regurgitate information without critical evaluation, you will be given 'major corrections' to re-write your literature review/ discussion or straight up failed, and you leave the university without your PhD. 

>especially on subjects that have nothing to do with your field.

Yeh, I agree. PhDs shouldn't be trusted as an authority on topics outside their degree. But for critical evaluation of scientific research, a science PhD will know how to evaluate research better than most. It's part of their training and a requirement for earning their degree. That's why I said I'd trust her more than a random internet researcher.

>I mean just look at how many schools out there lower requirements for money, and the amount of people that buy degrees.

I don't see how you can do this with a PhD. Many are funded by the university/ research councils, so there is no reason to support a failing student. Even if you fund your own project, your thesis and 
examination is graded by external examiners who are experts in the field. No-one from my university has any say in whether I pass my PhD. How could people just be 'given' a PhD in this context, or buy one? 

>let's not pretend a PhD makes you a critical thinker or infallible.

Not infallible. But a critical thinker? I would argue yes. Although I cannot speak for all disciplines, I would definitely say a science PhD is a critical thinker."
