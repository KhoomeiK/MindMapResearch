gaming,ff8w9n0,t1_ff8uwju,1579698186.0,"How many games do you have and how many of them have MT? I don’t want to put you in a bad light but hear me out.

A lot of people don’t like MT. A lot. The fact that people still buy those games doesn’t mean that they don’t care. It you’ve been waiting for a sequel for years MT aren’t enough to stop you from playing your childhood game. 

Complaining DOES work. My favorite example is Jake Paul. He makes videos for American children but my Dutch parents were talking about him because he was on national news! 

These opinions can spread like wildfire, just take one look at the hype leading up to no man sky and the bizarre crash in sales. 

Everything you said I’ve already read so many times the last 5 years. I hope my perspective makes sense :)"
gaming,ff8t6tx,t1_ff8r46m,1579695163.0,"Wrong. There’s different kind of micro transactions. Through complaints practically everywhere on the internet and bad sales companies have changed their way to make us pay. Most games only have cosmetic MT which is a good thing to have.  People don’t realize this!
If there is idiots spending thousands on cosmetics those companies can put more money into AAA games. The competition will be fiercer and the games will literally be better."

Imagine the douchebag died from this accident and those bikers saw you driving away laughing. Try explaining that to a judge (assuming you don’t have video evidence) 

Also in most accidents the police wants to do a breath test immediately. If you wait a day to give yourself in the judge can assume you just had to sober up to avoid extra punishment."
