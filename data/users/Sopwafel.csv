Like others have said, I'd focus on building mass. Having been fat is a big advantage, as you'll likely build muscle a lot faster than people that have always been skinny. 

I always say that being lean sacrifices long-term aesthetics for short-term aesthetics. I'm a bit fluffy right now but that's good for the gains. How can I ever be 80kg lean if I'm not 80kg in the first place? (I try to stay in the ~14-15% body fat range though)

Only thing I could add is that more workouts = better as your training age gets higher. The more muscle you have, the more often you need to hit them to keep growing at the highest pace. I grew the most when I went 6 times a week, doing a PPL split."

Those girls are strong as fuck. If you want to be ""hot"" as a woman, you need to lift heavy weights and build as much muscle as you can. Without steroids or years and years and years of hardcore dedication you're not going to become blocky or too muscular.

But yeah that's assuming you'd like to look anywhere near what I find attractive in women, like the girls in the video. That's not just genetics, anyone can look like that if they train hard."
