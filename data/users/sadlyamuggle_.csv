relationships,ff8bmk1,t3_es21cj,1579672011.0,"The next time she is in a funny and decent mood not mentioning baby stuff is when you should approach her and have an honest conversation about how you find her words bothersome. Not only is she ignoring your preferences but broadcasting to the office sensitive personal information.  Also, she could have a coworker in the office who is struggling to conceive overbearing, it could be upsetting for them to hear these comments as well."

AskReddit,ff565mi,t3_erop6k,1579581334.0,Photoshop. Really messed me up and I had an eating disorder in Highschool because I was so unaware of photoshops capabilities. I thought everyone online really looked like that.
AskReddit,ff561x2,t1_ff53pv8,1579581250.0,Some people like burn victims and women who have back problems and need breast reduction are people who I am happy plastic surgery exists for.  But I’m assuming you are referring to the Hollywood elites lying about their bodies and ruining people’s self esteem and realistic expectations! :)
AskReddit,ff55ojy,t3_eropft,1579580948.0,Audition to be a face character at Disney world. I would love to be a princess every day and bring joy to kiddos and adults alike. I’d probably do it for free too.

AskReddit,ff55b5f,t3_eroppq,1579580646.0,"Disney world at the magic kingdom. I was 18, my mom took me to Cinderella’s castle for breakfast to meet the princesses. We couldn’t afford that when I was little. I had been struggling with my eating disorder recovery and depression. With every hug from each princess I felt some of my sadness disappear. I remember watching the firework show crying tears of joy and my big brother looked at me and smiled so big and hugged me. 
We are going back in 17 days and I’m thrilled but nothing could beat last years trip because I needed some magic so much."
AskReddit,ff54gl8,t3_eropsg,1579579964.0,"I would put it between 9 and 10pm bc that’s my favorite time of day. I’ve gone to the gym and showered, I’ve eaten dinner, my homework is usually done by then and it’s my me time to read, paint my nails, color, watch tv, and call my mom. I think id be more relaxed."
AskReddit,ff540jw,t3_eroq43,1579579614.0,"In my parents house in the basement under the stairs there is a space I used to play with my dolls in because it was like a little house for them, but now I have a bean bag chair in there, colored pencils and coloring books, pillows, blankets, and books. It’s so small and cozy and my cat often joins me in there. It really is my safe space. My parents know it too, if I’m in there I am not to be disturbed bc I need me time and they really respect it!"
confession,ff53fs9,t3_eroqab,1579579168.0,"It is largely subjective, but in my creative writing English class we talked about what makes a good story, an element of relatability, but not predictable either. You should feel a connection to a character, but you shouldn’t be able to guess how the movie will end/how they will get there. For example we talked about friends. It had a lot of success because people could pick a main character they related to, and many people were curious about Ross and Rachel, the “will they won’t they”. But watch whatever you enjoy! It doesn’t matter what you’re “supposed” to like! :)"

AskReddit,ff52luv,t3_eroqhe,1579578527.0,"I had an MRI when I was a freshman in Highschool for a dislocated shoulder blade. They refused to put the shoulder blade back in place before putting me in the machine and made me lie on my back with all my weight pushing down onto the dislocated shoulder blade. I was crying so hard from the pain, and was very freaked out in anticipation for them to finally put it back in. They scolded me over the headset for squirming. They finally gave me a shot in my hip with the biggest needle I’d ever seen that knocked me out. When I woke up I was in a hospital bed and my mom told me they had to do another MRI because the whole time i was lying there my shoulder blade was slowly going back into the socket and the MRI was unclear. It was about 3am at this point, So no I don’t remember any beeping! I was in too much pain to notice. They gave me really weird music to listen to but I can’t even remember the genre."

She is so good at surprises and I just love her bunches. We have always been close, but We became very very close my junior year of Highschool when I went through a lot of mental health issues and I realized how amazingly supportive she was and how much I needed her"

AskWomen,fej4tkl,t3_epaxdr,1579156938.0,"I always wear pink, I love girly and classy pieces. Baby pink has my heart but lately I’ve been liking mauve a lot as well! I’ve found that sticking to a color palate helps me create outfits so much faster, everything in my closet matches and it generates so many combinations. So for me this is majority pink with some purple and red pieces. I know some people hate sticking to one color which I understand but it truly is my favorite and I feel so much like myself in pink. It took me a while to feel confident enough to embrace this about my style because I didn’t want to dress like my peers, and I’m so glad I finally have!"

They also must work much shorter hours with frequent lunch breaks. I know my employers would rather have all 16+ for the convenience!"

AmItheAsshole,feirvzz,t3_ep883l,1579145641.0,"NTA I never got an allowance, I had a job at 14 and I’m now a sophomore in college and am really proud of how much I’ve saved the last 5 years! I’m so happy my parents never gave me an allowance. It taught me a lot and it also makes me appreciate it even more when my parents decide to give me gas money randomly or if I’m shopping with my mom and she offers to pay for something. I think you should encourage your son to get a job if he’s able to get a ride somehow. As he earns his own money he will better understand it’s not something he should expect from you!"

AmItheAsshole,fefeugf,t3_eoley4,1579054827.0,"YTA. Reading this I just felt all my childhood dreams shatter, then I was relieved because I realized I wasn’t the one marrying you. Those dresses you were looking at will likely be see through, have stitching that is about to burst, and any pearl or jewel will fall off if she so much as moves. Your fiancé sounds like she has been very frugal her entire life, let her “splurge” on this dress because it’s likely the most important thing she will ever wear. If she wore what you wanted guests will arrive in outfits they spent more on, and the cake could cost more than her dress! You said yourself the price of the dress is financially not a problem, so let her buy the dress! I’m so sad for your fiancé"

As soon as the spray hits my wrist I’m ready to start my day. It makes me feel like “damn I’m pretty” my grandma used to say, “it’s not all about how you look, it’s how you smell”"

Michigan,fe6mhja,t1_fe6bdk0,1578895950.0,"I live on Lake Michigan and our home used to have 100ft of beach in front of it from our steps to the water about 3 years ago. We even had a volleyball net up, but now we have about 5 feet from our steps. Luckily our back yard is large and we aren’t in huge danger of our home falling into the lake, but some of our neighbors aren’t as lucky. We just want winter to come so the ice and snow buildup at shore block the waves."
AmItheAsshole,fe6kxyq,t1_fe5brwb,1578894338.0,"I was thinking the same thing. Since OP married last, she was likely under the impression she would get to keep the pin, and wasn’t expecting little sis to want it at her wedding. She just is afraid she won’t get it back after the wedding."
