But the problem is I did not want to come down of it, so when i started abusing it... things went from very good to awful in terms of being up for so long that I started having agitation and being really aggressive eventually it also turns me into light hypo mania and now I can never get it anymore from my shrink.

And nether realm games are also easier to learn. But you still need to put in the time, I myself started playing last year, and I am still learning every day, especially with SF5. Wich can be a fun game, but also frustrating because it's so complex. What you will also notice is that while it has it's learning curve, it's very rewarding if you learn to have the mindset of some sort of improvement every match and not focus on the losing to much.

Play style is more of a backup support, were you can take dmg, but enough damage were you can actually save your ult for other people. You can get more into the thick of the battle when mid to lategame comes, and you will be able to be more of a cc machine then to actually provide the dmg instead.

But you also need to gradually let yourself learn new things with **time.** Don't try to force things like you said that don't work for you. Also, if your motivation slides, just take action.

Also, try to make some small connection, only a smile or a good day. Start small, and just gradually get yourself more around people. I know this can drain lots of your energy ( for me it does also ) but i gets better with time. Also, I would suggest trying to read the power of the now by Eckart tholle. And just doing meditation on acceptance.

I also use medication sometimes to help with the really difficult times, but you can't always be perfect just keep in mind you are the most important one in your life, and you need to have thousands of new good thoughts, to get rid of all the bad habits and old thoughts.
