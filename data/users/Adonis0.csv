mechanical_gifs,ff8h09f,t1_ff8g0i3,1579678089.0,"Three methods have been used that I know of, depends on the health of the severed nerves

First type was basically a series of buttons that they press with the stump of their arm. Wiggle the stump up arm does x etc

Second is to attach electrodes to the pec and shoulder muscles, the patient must learn how to twitch a certain part of their pec to get the arm to move a certain way. Easier than it sounds due to the lack of use in patients pecs/shoulders and their desire to have an arm back. The brain and somatic (body) nerves rewire a lot quicker under those conditions.

Third method is to give the patient surgery and forcibly rewire their still active arm nerves to the pec muscles and then use the same type of electrodes. This bypasses the learning curve of the second method and allows the patient to integrate the arm a lot quicker. This however requires most to all of their major arm nerves to still be in tact and a very skilled surgeon who doesn’t destroy their nerves rewiring it.

Eventually all types will generate a sort of integration whereby the prosthesis will begin to feel like their arm due to the responsiveness.

This one is likely using two due to the accident described and the electrodes you can see"

In terms of what to put in, [this](http://www.bonberi.com/2017/01/09/food-combining-101/) will help you get started. You can eat ‘healthy’ and still have it bad for you if you just lump vegetables and fruit into your diet thinking their presence is enough. The better we follow the food combining, the better we feel.

We also follow along principles of using food as a medicine type stuff, don’t have a link handy for you with that one though. Idea of that is rather than using the big brutish adjustments of western medicine when you’re sick, you make tiny gentle adjustments when you’re not perfectly thriving. 

Examples being; chilli, ginger, garlic, salty things when you get the tiniest bit sniffly or if your throat starts into feeling sore. Lots of leafy greens (continental parsley, and bok choy are favs of ours) if your breath isn’t great, or if you start having to fart. Less carbs and more protein (especially for breakfast) if you’re finding your energy is having huge peaks and troughs around meal times.

Those three things are ones that have worked for myself within food as a medicine. You still follow along the normal western medicine, you’ll just find you’ll have to have treatment from the doctor less; eg only had one cold since starting it (2 years now), and it was the most mild one I have had, despite all my colleagues at the time walking around like the living dead from it. I’d usually get a few incidents per year. Be aware if you look into it yourself, some people claim you can completely forgo doctors with the right diet. Please don’t believe them. Using food as a medicine is a lot less potent than pharmaceuticals, but also doesn’t strain your body to use."
