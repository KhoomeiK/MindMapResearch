Tinder,ffqzju6,t1_ffqxkjh,1580147165.0,He used to date bigfoot.
holdmycosmo,ffpne0q,t1_ffp7146,1580099454.0,She looked like it shocked common sense into her.
NoStupidQuestions,ffpgtll,t1_ffpadka,1580094699.0,"When those same people show up two hours after you just start saying something like ""late start today?"" or even just spit ""half day?"" back at them."
Cringetopia,ffpex4z,t1_ffp9bpv,1580093344.0,Just make sure that you're only in frame because you walked into it and started this discussion while they're recording their tiktok.
dndmemes,ffpemiq,t1_ffpboi4,1580093131.0,"No, it's just Bruce Willis in The Fifth Element."
todayilearned,ffmy7ob,t1_ffmwjm0,1580060149.0,Oh god. You're a person who thinks they know everything about a stranger on the internet for literally no reason and then acts like they were given a creative writing assignment on the topic.
todayilearned,ffmvsoi,t1_ffmubpc,1580059441.0,"No, what's the point of sending an email or IM if you're just going to call them anyway?"
todayilearned,ffmuo5a,t1_ffmtuae,1580059137.0,"Yes, that's surely the only possible scenario that might occur in. It's definitely not possible that people aren't responding to emails, phone calls, or IMs because they're not at their desk and instead are socializing elsewhere. 

I also didn't say ""right now"" because not everything is on the same schedule but there is an appropriate amount of time to respond to something and it's almost never ""sometime next week."""
AskReddit,ffmu66i,t1_ffm612y,1580058944.0,"I worked at Five Guys, a burger place, years ago and had a customer come in one day and let me know that it was very important that people spell out Five when looking for our website. Apparently 5Guys.com was a gay porn site at the time."
todayilearned,ffmsvt7,t1_ffmqru9,1580058570.0,Not to mention that it's fucking impossible to get some people to respond in a timely manner unless you physically track them down and talk face to face. I only want to work from home if I either don't have to do any actual work or if I get a remote controlled robot with a camera at the office so I can still track people down to make them respond.
MurderedByWords,ffe89xy,t1_ffe5jsb,1579839409.0,"Health insurance is the main one people are talking about but there are some others too, including unemployment. Unless the company you work for had less than 50 employees or wasn't in the US they were breaking the law if they didn't provide benefits.

And actually for most of the minimum wage jobs I've worked a 24 hour place would have more than three 8 hour shifts because you need some overlap."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffe4t9s,t1_ffe41re,1579836713.0,No worries.
MurderedByWords,ffe4r4f,t1_ffdxwux,1579836668.0,Minimum wage jobs will often times schedule a person for 8 hours and won't account for the lost time for their unpaid half hour lunch. Many will actually even schedule you for less than that so you don't hit the number of hours per week where they're required to provide benefits.
MurderedByWords,ffe4hub,t1_ffdk3ti,1579836474.0,Even in their made up fantasy world that $500/month still only gets you a studio and not a one bedroom as the initial claim stated.
MurderedByWords,ffe3nim,t1_ffdwczc,1579835847.0,"I didn't know that about 0! so I looked it up and, at least according to the initial source I found, 0! = 1 just because it has to for other things to work and not because 0! = 1 when you work it out like all the other factorials. 

I'm sure someone with a much better understanding of math will come along and tell me I'm wrong, and stupid, but the explanation I got makes sense and I'm sure the correction I'll get will not."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffe3apv,t1_ffe1wko,1579835584.0,I never said anything about your opinion. I was further correcting your analogy to account for the price increase. I also didn't provide the previous analogy.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffe1dwu,t1_ffdzczu,1579834181.0,If the car salesman said that the extra cost over the sticker price went to his mother's medical bills then that would be a scam too. If they weren't charging extra and just said that was their personal motivation for working that would just be a lie to get you to buy from him instead of another salesman.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffe16iw,t1_ffe0mse,1579834033.0,"It only makes it not a scam if the person selling it frames the added cost as a convince fee and not ""for charity"". A scam is still a scam whether you buy into it or not."
gaming,ffdxxl8,t1_ffdrtzt,1579831684.0,Does that 74 include the Ditto?
politics,ffdsm3j,t1_ffddpol,1579827890.0,He should definitely be thrown out. We want to make sure he doesn't leave a precedent for this kind of thing for future wannabe dictators.
Gamingcirclejerk,ffadskt,t1_ffacuk7,1579733206.0,"Where did I make any kind of quality or cost judgement on either type of car, let alone specifically maintenance costs?"
shittyfoodporn,ffa9a2t,t1_ffa0nrx,1579730380.0,Trying to mentally adjust for the flash and only looking at the hot dogs themselves they don't look bad to me. They definitely look way better than I thought they would with those cooking instructions.
Gamingcirclejerk,ffa8goy,t1_ffa7phg,1579729924.0,"Where's the reach? They said they know something, someone else called them out on it, and they immediately said ""tesla fanboy told me so"". Now they're claiming they do followup research to confirm, so why not say that from the start or present some of that follow up research to back up their initial claim?"
