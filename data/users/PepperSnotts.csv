She was working on a little *shih tzu*, who was normally a very good boy, but that day, my coworker commented on how restless he was, making the grooming a bit difficult.  She stood behind him and lifted his long tail to make sure his back end was trimmed evenly... and he unleashed an explosive torrent of doggy diarrhea directly at her. It was on my coworker, on the table, on the floor, on the wall behind her...  She just stood there, dumbfounded as the rest of us just laughed our asses off.

So when the commenter I replied to said they *only* tipped 20% for crappy service, when otherwise they wouldve tipped as high as 50%, there's no ""lesson"" for the server to learn.  That server was probably expecting 20%, and their crappy service was rewarded by it. They had no idea that they could've gotten half the bill as a tip, since 50% tip isn't  *standard*."

Part of being a fucking parent is dealing with shit life throws at you, while raising your kids.  You are so fucking pathetic.

My SIL's exhusband does this same shit.  She has the kids all week, they see their dad on weekends.  He's always asking her to pick them up Saturday pm or early Sunday am... cause he has ""stuff to do"".  You know what my SIL does when she has the kids during the week and also has ""stuff to do""?

One of my friends did 3 months in northern Norway, working for a dog sled tour company. He helped take care of all the dogs.  Each dog had a small doghouse, packed with straw and they slept in them during frigid temps. My own dog is a Bernese Mtn dog/ German Shepherd mix and she gets uncomfortable around 70F, but bring her out during a full-on blizzard and she's in absolute heaven.  

My childhood dog was a wolf/husky and he NEVER slept inside, even though we tried to get him to come in during our cold New England winters.  His thick coat and the little neat he made under the porch did just fine keeping him warm.
