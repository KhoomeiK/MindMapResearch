MakeNewFriendsHere,ffvm36j,t1_ffvkpd3,1580267334.0,Yes!! Me too. I see 15f in the title and I get legit worried for them.
MakeNewFriendsHere,ffvlu07,t3_evfhv4,1580267159.0,"I 100% agree with 1-3. It's annoying seeking friendship with someone knowing that if they're a girl then they may have to read through tens to hundreds of fuck boys bullshit messages. It's annoying for them too. And some of the dudes on here are creepy af.

I hard disagree with 4 though. I'm a dude and except for the very rare exception, I've only felt super close with girl friends and not guy friends. All my bffs have been girls. I'm working to open myself up to bromances, but it's a robust thing I have for a gender preference with friends. I know guys that are like that and girls that are like that (preferring guys). 

Anyway, I just want friendship and platonic connection atm. I really hate horny bois for ruining that shit for both the girls and people like me."

TooAfraidToAsk,ffu38vo,t1_fftnylv,1580233538.0,"Odds are that OP thinks people who dress ""normal"" can't be gay. Don't doubt OP's flawless reasoning based only in LOGIC, but if your SMALL BRAIN needs help, here is a LOGICAL PROOF of THE STRAIGHT UP FACTS:

**THE STRAIGHT UP FACTS:** *People who dress ""normal"" can't be gay.*

**A silly question:** *Why?*

**THE SELF-EVIDENT ANSWER:** *Because all gay people dress ""weird"".*

**Another ridiculous question:** *How do they know that?*

**A MORE OBVIOUS ANSWER EVEN INFANTS KNOW:** *Because OP has seen gay people and they all dress ""weird"".*

**I thought the questions couldn't get stupider but here we go again:** *But what about the gay people who dress ""normal"" that OP doesn't realize are gay?*

**MORE SCIENCE TO SHUT YOU UP:** *Those people can't possibly be gay because they dress ""normal"".*

**A question that will make you lose brain cells:** *Why not?*

**THE FINAL WORD:** *\[See ""****THE STRAIGHT UP FACTS****"" above.\]*"

CasualConversation,ffrjgvj,t3_eutqs2,1580159269.0,"I thought the first two episodes were pretty bad. The fighting scenes in particular were just cringey, like a spin around and blocking a heavy blow by holding your sword behind your back? Lame. Some of the dialogue seemed stilted, too, which is perhaps why I felt the narrative wasn't really developing organically.

It does get better though. I think it even gets good. I have a feeling if I returned to the early episodes, I'd still somewhat cringe. But I liked various things, like Yen's story. 

That said, I don't think it's great, but it's good and entertaining enough that I'd watch the second, although my hopes would be lower -- that'd probably actually make the experience better lmao."

Showerthoughts,ffqgmvi,t1_ffqbzll,1580134027.0,"I mean, it wouldn't happen within the first generation of babies' lifetime, or even the second, or... you get the idea. It would take almost as long as evolution took to do that -- with a little boost, of course, for inheriting some innate capacities that our ancestors didn't have."
Showerthoughts,ffqbjkl,t1_ffqagbe,1580129337.0,"Many mammals, including certain primates, have a basic set of innate communicative expressions, like a baby's cry to express pain, discomfort, or fear. But these aren't enough to under-gird the growth of a full-fledged natural language. It also requires some seriously developed cognitive skills that allow the animal to use its basic set of expressions or even novel devices to communicate a wider range of mental states.

If you leave two babies by themselves, preventing them from ever receiving linguistic input from adults who speak full-fledged natural languages, the babies won't learn to babble in phonemes and as a result won't develop the capacity for natural language -- they'll even be incapable of doing so after a certain developmental stage (like feral children, who after a certain age simply cannot learn, say, English, after being away from language-speaking peeps like us)."
LifeProTips,ffqb633,t1_ffqaatf,1580128949.0,"Sorry to inform you, but ""seriously"" and ""srsly"" are two different words that share the same meaning but each of which possesses its own phonetic character and connotations. The latter is pronounced as it appears, eliding the vocal gaps between the consonants to create an almost slurred word. And it connotes the visage of a drama queen asking a rhetorical question quietly but with passive punch packed down tight within, just waiting to be released by the tea spiller.
