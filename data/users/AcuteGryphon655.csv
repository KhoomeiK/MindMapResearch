todayilearned,ffewn2a,t1_ffekdot,1579868565.0,"Right off the bat, ""darkest days"" doesn't mean threat of invasion, it means seeing your closest Allies fall one by one in Europe and Asia. It means watching France fall under Nazi control in less than a month, and seeing tens of thousands of British and French soldiers have to be evacuated after *losing* to the Nazis. Then you have the attack on Pearl Harbor and the other islands, having to watch Britain get relentlessly bombed, and watching ships get torpedoed left and right off the coast of the US. 

And that's just from a civilian perspective. If you're in the military, you can have darkest days all the time, as you try to fight back the Nazi and Japanese threats. Hell, even the Civilian Merchant Marines had some dark days, seeing as 9,000 of them were killed before before boots even landed in Western Europe. 

Quit being Eurocentric and try to understand that you don't have to be invaded to fear about the future of the world at the hands of the Nazis."
todayilearned,ffevrb1,t1_ffeo6o1,1579867603.0,"You can't just look at any major aspect of the war and say, ""it wasn't necessary so they shouldn't have done it."" Was the invasion of Italy necessary? Apparently not, according to you, but someone had to get it done and any major strides taken supports the Allies in the war, even if it was in part to stop Soviet influence. Was D-Day and the invasion of France necessary, apparently not, but it led to the destruction of the Nazis in Western Europe, something that took away resources from the Nazis trying to stop the Soviets. In fact, the Ruhr would've still been producing away without direct US destruction, stopping the thing that would've been a thorn in the Soviets' side."

He's not perfect, he has his flaws, but he's founded two companies that basically are achieving what the past could only dream of, and I think that's pretty cool."
TumblrInAction,ff8tors,t1_ff8g7wg,1579695702.0,"As weird as it is, it kinda makes sense to me (besides 365black.com). There's not really any other major demographic in the US that advertising to would be more successful than to the black population, if you think about it. There's not much of a Latin-American population spread out across the US, they seek to be located more in the South and Southeast (they probably get some targeted ads there, but I doubt as many). A lot of my Asian friends still have huge connections to their ancestor's (or even their parent's) country's cultures, so I doubt many of them would see McDonald's as a good resturaunt to actually eat at (though this is definitely not the same for everyone). However, the African-American community has developed an African-American culture within the US, and pandering to that can probably increase sales from the black community. While McDonald's food isn't amazing by any stretch of the imagination, I'm betting it's seen as a more ""welcoming"" establishment as advertising towards the African-Americans will probably increase their willingness to go to McDonald's over Burger King or Wendy's."

WinStupidPrizes,ff35a5z,t1_ff2nltp,1579534009.0,"Imagine you're sitting there waiting for the bomb squad to show up in order to diffuse a suspected bomb, when suddenly somebody breaks through the police barricade, runs over to the suspected bomb, and starts messing with it. You watch him start pulling stuff out of it, so what do you start to think? ""Oh that guy's just trying to make our jobs easier, I guess there was never any bomb to begin with,"" or, ""that man just started touching the bomb, what if he placed it and is trying to detonate it?"" In these kinds of situations, they can't afford to just assume that he's just a friendly guy. It's like the Battle of Fallujah. Since the entire city was told to evacuate, anyone who didn't leave is basically assumed to be a hostile. If you tell everyone to stay out of the area because a bomb might go off, anyone unauthorized who gets close to it probably isn't a friendly. Thus, tackling them in order to prevent them from detonating a suspected bomb is probably the best course of action."
WinStupidPrizes,ff1mz29,t1_ff0goov,1579481859.0,"People are downvoting this, even if it's the most rational train of thought. And that's what annoys me to no end about Reddit and most social media platforms. People need to realize that they don't have to agree with everything that's presented as being on their side of the political spectrum. Say someone's a liberal, and they see something that another liberal is saying that's just plain stupid. Even if what they're saying is liberal and not conservative, even if they're saying it to argue against a conservative point of view, that doesn't mean you have to agree with them. Switch the roles and we still have the same exact problem. People online are so divided, they want to prove the other side wrong so bad, that they choose to ignore common sense for the sake of trying to make the other side look bad. If someone on Twitter says, ""Black people experience so much racism, white people are terrible and need to be gotten rid of,"" people should approach it thinking, ""Black people do experience a lot of racism still, but blaming it on white people is also racism."" Black people experiencing a lot of racism still is generally a liberal point of view, and it's definitely right. But white people being all bad is not a liberal point of view. So why do people agree to it? Because everyone wants to prove the other side wrong. And it's fucking stupid. We can't sacrifice common sense for the sake of appearing correct or better than someone else. It's just letting ourselves become increasingly divided."
