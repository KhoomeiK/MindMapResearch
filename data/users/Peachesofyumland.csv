offmychest,fek7aan,t3_epf4v0,1579194089.0,Wow that’s awesome to hear. I’m currently struggling with meth. It makes me laugh because I’m at a point where I no longer want to do it but the habit is ridiculously hard to break. Figuring out how to stop that habit and change my thinking has been a struggle. I just relapsed on Christmas Eve I was clean for 83 days. Congratulations though! I’m super proud of you I know how difficult it is.
offmychest,fejmcs8,t3_epf4v0,1579179746.0,Your an inspiration. Honestly! People struggle everyday  and you had the guts to change your outcome on life! How did you do it?
offmychest,fecnv2c,t3_eoeu81,1578978634.0,Don’t do it. I know it gets tough at times. I will listen. I will give you advice. Friend to friend. I know I don’t know you but trust me I do care so much! I love you enough to hear you out. Please talk to me first. Nothing is worth doing this to yourself. NOTHING!
offmychest,fe9xlnu,t3_eo4j99,1578942317.0,This honestly brought me to tears! How does one finally be nice to themselves though? I stuggle with that everyday. I love seeing people smile it brings me such joy but when it comes to myself it’s like I don’t know how. I’m glad this helped you to a better place mentally. It makes me happy knowing your a little bit better then yesterday.
