Periods,ffih8iu,t3_etn6pz,1579973817.0,"Happens to me the first few days (mine usually last about 8 days). I've learned that I need to set an alarm for about 3:30 or halfway through the night to prevent it. And that's with an ultra tampon and an overnight pad. Some people just get really heavy periods, unfortunately."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fes8gc0,t1_ferzqe7,1579362520.0,I remember seeing the missing posters around town for that girl my freshman year of college. It freaked me out when I heard what actually happened. Everyone on campus was talking about it. There was a rumour going around that the victim had been threatening to tell the killers secrets and that's why they decided to kill her.

selfimprovement,fcwgz30,t1_fcw6faj,1578025367.0,"I want to be able to do this. I'm not sure how to ask this, but how do you put yourself in that mental space? 
That wording sounds bad, but I genuinely want to be able to say ""fuck it, I owe you nothing"" and focus on my happiness and putting myself down for something silly."
selfimprovement,fcw8onp,t1_fcw8hcz,1578019692.0,"Thank you so much! I often see people on Reddit advise others to seek therapy, but never explain how. I've been too embarrassed to look into it myself. Something else I'll need to work on, admitting I need help haha
