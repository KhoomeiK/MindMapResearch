AskReddit,ffkp1sr,t1_ffko4tj,1580026416.0,"I understand that completely - I was just giving an example. Maybe you should think about what you do have to offer because really and truly unless you're a serial killing, child raping, dog drowning, sadist then it's highly likely that you have plenty to offer but to the right person. Certain people make us feel worthless and my advice as an older person with much life experience, is to stay the fuck away from those people and find the ones who accept you as you are! Good luck."
pics,ffkmxks,t1_ffkldky,1580025401.0,I agree. Most of the facial features are different.
AskReddit,ffkmojm,t3_eu3vke,1580025285.0,"It depends on the situation. Sometimes you've nothing to offer a person simply because they cannot accept the things you do have to offer. I'm a teacher for adults and sometimes I get a student that instantly dislikes me and maybe the feeling is mutual. Therefore it's futile to expect a good outcome. On the other hand if I get a student that I like but they think they're too good for my classes, with a little persuasion and encouragement, they come to realise that they could greatly benefit from what I have to offer.
So, to sum up, don't expect everyone to like you, no matter what you have to offer. Everyone has something in them that is useful or interesting for someone. Never give up."
