AskReddit,ff5fa1k,t3_ero8mj,1579590344.0,"She'd be surprised with how we had the perfect career and ditched in order to save our health, but she'd be proud of us for putting ourself first finally. She'd be delighted that our father was no longer a part of our lives, she'd probably want to skip forward to present day just to get to that stage in her life.
She'd be crazy excited that we have a beautiful dog and tall, handsome partner. 
She'd be disgusted that as an adult we now spend the majority of our day on Mathematics now, but I'd like to reassure her that in a few years time she'll find joy in solutions and theories."

AskReddit,ff24xs0,t3_equok1,1579493923.0,"Just before the UK introduced 'sugar tax' (2019 or 2018, I don't remember), my mother-in-law bought enough bags of sugar to fill an entire cabinet. I never had the heart to tell her that the sugar tax was solely for sugary foods, not sugar itself, so now I just tell this story to the Internet behind her back to get karma."

dogs,fexty76,t1_fermme3,1579436215.0,"You're right, I'm just going to start picking it up, and like another user commented, maybe organise a poop pick up day in the community. I guess I've had that attitude of ""filthy people not picking up after their dogs"", but not actually taking the change into my own hands. Thank you!"
dogs,fextttc,t1_ferb0bo,1579436098.0,"This is a very good idea, I might organise this actually. The only thing that does make my tummy turn is picking up cold dog poop, but it's worth it for a cleaner walking area. Be the change you want to see and all that!"
LoveIslandTV,fepx9l9,t3_eq4cik,1579333970.0,"Social media was starting to make me feel horrid with all of the double standards, all the bitching and shaming posts alongside all the acceptance and awareness posts. I was happy to get rid of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and now I just try to mostly avoid clicking toxic posts on Reddit."

I think it maybe applies to owners who treat their dogs like they're dustbins with scraps and junk, combined with a lack of exercise. Your pit/shepherd mix sounds super interesting!"

It's the beagles/labradors of the world that shouldn't generally have food left out, those little piggies will eat that and the kitchen fridge whole if allowed!"

AmItheAsshole,fcsqjtl,t3_eiawtt,1577922580.0,"NTA - my partner and I have a rescue dog that HATES fireworks, so we always stay home and decline invites on NYE. It's the responsible thing to do as a pet owner, especially one with a history of abuse - well done you."
dogs,fcluklo,t3_eho07v,1577756825.0,"It was quite an anxious time after I adopted him initially, and I couldn't stop worrying that I wasn't feeding him right/exercising him properly/ petting him and loving him like he needed. It was overwhelming knowing that I was now solely responsible for this being, and I felt a lot of pressure to help him get through his past traumas quickly. He taught me a lot about patience and he really sparked a softer part of me back to life.

Two years on and I couldn't imagine life without him - he is the most adorable, mischievious, defiant, funny, grumpy creature I have ever known. Sometimes it's hard to get out with him during depressive episodes, but when I reach for his collar and he throws all 40kg at my chest, his happiness is contagious. Gaining his trust and watching him transform from a frightened and abused thing into his current beautiful self has been such a motivation for me to help myself. He loves me no matter what I look or feel like, he doesn't judge, and he's just as happy going for a run together as he is when we're chilling out bingeing on Netflix. 

If I could offer any advice it would be to look into greyhounds - they're incredibly versatile dogs and lap up long walks/runs, but are also more than happy to sleep all day (they'll just hog the whole sofa/bed so invest in a big bean bag) when you're feeling truly terrible. They're also incredibly gentle and sweet, low maintenance for grooming, generally have very good health with long lifespans for a large dog, and aren't particularly slobbery/smelly/barky."
