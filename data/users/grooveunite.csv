GetMotivated,feewe8h,t1_feevss6,1579042655.0,Nah. Review the history. The fans were screaming for blood and demanding change  including University staff.
GetMotivated,feeuhmk,t1_feelwxg,1579041482.0,I'm born and raised Baton Rouge... LSU fans have a habit of turning on coaches after one or two bad seasons. Just look at what happened to Nick Saban.

AskReddit,fdjcb0f,t3_ell2h8,1578465068.0,"I went 3500 miles away for 18 years. It helped but didn't end the controlling behavior. I moved back to take care of my mom. She's very child like but was also super over-protective as a child because she was raised that way by my grandmother who was abducted when she was young and would never talk about it. My dad's a raging narcissist control freak, who chose her because she could be controlled and was highly dependant. I keep my distance from him. He does love me but talks to me like a kid still at 45 and can be a real asshole. I went no contact for several years and though he's better somewhat, some days, he'll never admit the part he played in driving me off. I had to really put my foot down. It'll never really change though. I just had to accept that introspection isn't in his toolkit and I'd be waiting forever and angry forever if I wasn't the bigger man and to forgive him. Still won't take any shit though... boundaries have to be set."
