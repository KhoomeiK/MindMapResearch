Some days I eat really healthy. Other days, I work a microwave pizza or fast food into my daily intake. Today it was IHOP.

lmao. It would be difficult to find a wedding dress second hand for that price, before alterations. I think mine was $700 total, and that's because I lucked out and found a dress that really only needed to be hemmed.

Edit: I mean for traditional wedding dresses. There are other perfectly nice dresses you could get for less than that if that's what you want."

AmItheAsshole,feb8xfd,t3_eobujo,1578956505.0,NTA! They gave him up because they didn't want to train him. That's not how owning pets works. Do you really feel guilty about not wanting to give your dog up to people that selfish?

The first few months of being a vegetarian, I spent hours looking up recipes on Pinterest and tried a lot of new things. The biggest hurdle to get over was rethinking how my meals were laid out (more one pot meals, casseroles, soups, and chili vs. a meat and sides)."
