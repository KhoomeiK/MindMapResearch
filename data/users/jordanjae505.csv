socialwork,fff5bts,t1_fff57o1,1579876090.0,Thank you so much for this advice.
JUSTNOMIL,feis8rj,t1_feiqbbf,1579145888.0,"I bet people will get mad, they either live for the drama or they're one of the so called karma fanatics (the term used often as whores but I feel that's derogatory to women).

Honestly, I originally came to JNMIL because I loved the hell out of the drama. I felt bad for the OPs, but I loved reading about the crazy shit these MILs did. I didn't comment, just read and occasionally upvoted posts with a major justice boner. But the community grows on you. You start to realize that your own mother or MIL displays some shitty behavior, and you start reading the comments to see if you can get some advice. Then you start posting on your own experiences and get solid advice or support. Then because people were so kind to you, you want to offer your own help where you can. And suddenly, you're at a place where you truly see the human behind the post and your heart bleeds for them and you want to do anything you can to help. I'm not sad that I came here originally for the drama, I'm proud that I've grown through watching the sub follow its own path.

But now we're on a path that this sub has been a huge source of karma fanatics and breakout subs aren't going to do shit about changing that. You don't get that sweet karma from justnofamfiction. If we're truly in the business of helping and supporting people, we need to continue to hide karma to the extent we're able and we need to limit the avenues by which karma can be sought out. Most people won't care about the change in sort. Some will just change it out of habit every time they get onto the sub, others will roll with it. The people that care are the ones who still feed of the drama, because there's no sense in commenting on a post with 600 comments because OP is done reading by then. That's my thought anyway."
JUSTNOMIL,feiqslv,t1_feipsnu,1579144878.0,"It's not making things worse for you unless you and your FDH continue to allow FMIL to make an ass of herself. Her behavior has consequences and if she's going to be shitty and disrespectful after realizing that she's reaping what she's sowed, there is nothing you can do about it other than cutting her off even more. She's been cut out of her son's wedding because she treated you like shit, if she doesn't make that connection and start to change her behavior, how much of yourselves are you willing to sacrifice to make things less hard on you when you'll constantly be fighting a losing battle?"
JUSTNOMIL,feipi21,t3_ep97gy,1579143997.0,"I'm so excited for you both. I'm glad you're getting what you wanted out of this.

However, I do want to say that if your mom has continued to be supportive and hasn't made an ass of herself, you should discuss with your FDH about inviting her if that's what you want. If you don't want her there and were only inviting her so she could witness the marriage of her only child, ignore my suggestion and I apologize for bringing it up.

 But if you truly want her there with you, then neither you nor her should be punished due to FMILs crappy behavior. You gave them an opportunity to play fair and your FMIL decided to be an asshole, now you don't have an obligation to play fair anymore.

Again if you're not wanting her there or are feeling apathetic about her being there, feel free to ignore me."
JUSTNOMIL,feinlnn,t1_feij82o,1579142734.0,"Could you hide it using CSS? I've seen that r/thedonald managed to hide one of their buttons using CSS. They were banned for it because it prevented users from seeking help, but hiding Karma doesn't prevent that."
JUSTNOMIL,feinf54,t1_feijbnp,1579142612.0,"The baby bumps subreddit I'm in automatically sorts by new. If you want to reach out to the mods at r/may2020bumpers, they may be able to assist with this. Then people automatically get sorted by new and they have to make the effort to change it to Hot or Best."
JustNoTruth,fdz06s9,t1_fdytzld,1578785398.0,"BelBel or whatever he was called was the only fake who garnered significant amounts of attention, at least that I've really remembered. I was following JNMIL before justnoso was created. Yes, there have been fakes. But they've mostly been supplemental to sagas on JNMIL. 

What I meant by saying it's not good for karma whoring is that if you look at the top posts of all time on the subreddit, the highest post only has 3.6K in karma. If you're going to write a fake story for the purposes of karma on the JNN, it's better to set this up as an MIL story in JNMIL where MIL is the one who needs care and is masterminding this whole thing with the SILs as FM."
AmItheAsshole,fdxofcd,t1_fdxin4a,1578771246.0,"Like I said, don't tell her what the reward is. You can say that there's an opportunity to improve her situation without promising anything.

Yes, it's really hard to distinguish from real and simulated empathy. OP and his wife will need to have a really solid plan in place to determine whether or not their daughter has really changed. There's been suggestions for therapy, for volunteering, for reading and watching different materials, etc. There's so many ways they can mix these things together and check in with her to see how she's processing it. They can check in with her teachers, check in with the girl that she bullied, check in with the people around her to see if she really is different and if her behavior reflects that. Teenage girls are smart, but they don't have fully developed impulse control yet. She won't be able to stop herself from being shitty to other people if she really hasn't changed."
AmItheAsshole,fdw8yj3,t1_fdw53u6,1578756282.0,"I agree. Or consider allowing her to go to prom if she manages to develop and demonstrate some empathy before then. I wouldn't tell her about it, I would take the approach of telling her that her punishment would be reduced in some way if she watches/reads appropriate materials and can demonstrate understanding of why her actions were so bad.

Prom in my town is usually in late April or May, I think that there's plenty of time for her to understand the severity of her actions and learn from them, then the parents can surprise her with a trip to buy a prom dress and say that prom is the reward for growing as a human being and learning from her actions."
JustNoTruth,fdw7hvn,t1_fdw6fhz,1578755906.0,This will be an interesting one to watch and see where it goes.
JustNoTruth,fdw506z,t1_fdw2hb4,1578755138.0,"OP seems to have demonstrated to the family that they can't mess with her the way that they do with DH. And the sisters did try to get both of them in the house, not just the DH. Maybe they did have a goal to make OP provide the care but that DH's helplessness would cause OP to do everything for both him and FIL. I never would have expected OP and DH to separate the way they did, it usually ends with both of them going or both of them staying. Again, pure speculation at this point, I don't think there's really a way to question the OP about these things short of her finding this post. 

I think that OP did exhibit some concern about his mental health, if the post is true she is the reason he was in therapy to deal with the family issues. Any decent therapist would be looking at everything going on in his life, not just the family issues. So it's possible she was ignoring signs of a mental health issue due to her pregnancy and that's why the sister said his mental health matters too.

Definitely agree on the baby and the source of the money for the IVF. These are two things that put me on edge and are the reason I won't say I believe this OP."
JustNoTruth,fdw1sj9,t1_fdw0t7n,1578754165.0,Very possible. I'll be curious to see how this poster progresses.
JustNoTruth,fdvzc7w,t3_en7bqu,1578753426.0,"In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not entirely sure I believe this poster. But I am going to say that many of the concerns you raised have potentially valid explanations, just based on my own experiences. I'm going to discuss some of those but I don't want it to be taken as I think you're wrong or that this poster is truthful, just that my experiences tell me that there could be an explanation. 

So in terms of the ages/timing, I think this adds up. She was 20 when they got together, he was 28/29 and she started immediately at getting him to therapy and get him to be more responsible. She's now 27 and claims he is 35. This math is does make sense to me.

I work in a nursing home, I have seen men who completely fall apart after their wives die and truly don't know how take care of themselves. Families are very quick to insist that someone steps in and provide the care, so this is not surprising to me. Though in my experience, I don't see very many families where the person providing care was railroaded into doing so. The families I meet are incredibly supportive, the kids come with their spouses to meetings, everyone is all about making sure dad doesn't have to live in the nursing home. It feels like I hear a lot on the JNN about family being forced into providing care and I could see it happening, but not this often. 

I also think it's telling that both FIL and DH have this same history of receiving all the care they needed from MIL and being relatively irresponsible/incapable as a result until OP intervened. The sisters were much more independent than their brother and rightly so as their mother taught them to do everything for the men in their lives. It could even explain why they want DH to care for FIL now, they spent their whole lives caring for him and now they want him to step up. 

Regarding the pregnancy and hospital stay, I see both sides. My husband currently comes with me to every doctor appointment and ultrasound, plus he's there every time I've been sent to the ER during my pregnancy (I'm fine, my doctor's office staff are stupid and send me to the ER for dumb things) and will stay with me in the hospital when the baby arrives. There is an expectation set that he'll be there with me because this is our baby and he should be involved and part of this even if he isn't the one actually growing the baby. But if he told me that my health issues in the pregnancy were affecting his mental health, I'd move the earth from my bed in the hospital to get him the care he needed and I'd be understanding if he told me that he needed some time away. The post doesn't read like that's what happened, it does sound like the sister is manipulating him.

I even understand the refusal to move, I wouldn't give up my pets to move in with my FIL when I didn't want to provide care in the first place. Even after 7ish years of therapy, it's hard for a formerly enmeshed man with unhealthy familial relationships to stay out of such a tough situation. I could see him struggling, I could see OP getting frustrated because she thought they were past this, and I could see her giving up and letting go if she's truly spent the last 7 years being treated like garbage for exposing unhealthy family dynamics and changing them. 

I don't mind the rental, my DH and I are not able or willing to buy a house due to financial reasons but we make more than enough to cover our rent for our home in a wealthy neighborhood and great school system. It's just inconvenient to own a home because our savings won't cover any major expenses that come up. Rentals mean the landlord pays for everything that goes wrong. I'm still incredibly attached to my home it really feels like it was designed for us and I don't intend to leave for a long time. 

The kid and the ivf are what I don't understand. Seven years together with DH who barely was responsible for himself when they got together able to pay for IVF? Some insurances cover some of the costs of IVF but I don't see how it's possible they saved up the money to do this in such a short time frame. Maybe they took out a loan and they could only choose the IVF or the house? But you're right about the kid. She says almost nothing about the kid in all of this. That's what rings alarm bells for me, the lack of discussion about this kid and how their relationship has been since the kid entered the picture. And them going through IVF but the husband pulling back so much? I don't know. Maybe he really was so badly enmeshed in everything that he did abandon his kid like that. We saw it happen with Drudge, though that DH had other issues.

I could be completely off base, but I don't see as many red flags. Plus, justnoso is not the place to karma farm. So I fail to see the motivation to fake the story.

Edit: finished an incomplete thought."
socialwork,fdpdh16,t1_fdpbw5m,1578625846.0,"The refusal to understand available resources is one of the worst parts. I got in trouble because I had a patient who was discharging to an incredibly rural area about 2 hours away from the facility. She had no transportation benefit through insurance and I warned her of that. I told her and she swore up and down that her boyfriend would pick her up. Day of discharge, her boyfriend doesn't feel like it. Can we help her, please? I went straight to my boss because I knew she couldn't afford to pay for a private transport, she lived off $400 a month in the middle of nowhere. We have a fund available exactly for situations like this. He was so mad. He asked me why we didn't figure this out before. I told him that I did. There was no other option, no other resource. We either dropped the money to pay for a Lyft out in the middle of nowhere, or we lost money for every day she was here because we were never going to recoup that money. He kept insisting, there must be something. I said there were things, but they were for people lived in the city limits, not two hours away in the middle of nowhere. But I got raked over the coals for not planning the discharge effectively. I love SNF work in so many ways and I even love the discharge planning and the chaos when things go wrong. What I don't love is the lack of support from the team."
socialwork,fdpcisz,t1_fdp9rz2,1578625190.0,"I sometimes miss hospital work, I did the exact opposite of you and interned in the hospital. It was so fun sometimes. I'd go back to it if I didn't love geriatrics. And I like that I have more time to get to know my residents, but I still get to meet new people. Hospital moves too fast for me. I think if I get tired of SSD work, I'll go back to the hospitals for a bit.

I don't claim to be perfect. But I am fed up with being the scapegoat."
socialwork,fdpc1ng,t1_fdp72gg,1578624863.0,"I am due to leave for maternity leave in May. I had seriously considered making an offer to my administrator to take full level for a month and then return part time, mostly working from home while caring for my baby. It was partially because I don't have the PTO to cover my leave and I'd like to supplement my income a bit, but it's also because I know that it's hard to replace me for just three months and my leave coincides with our survey window. They don't really have contract SSDs in my area, so he'll be expecting everyone else on the team to cover me and it won't end well. Despite everyone complaining about me, they do miss me when I'm gone. I may or may not come back at this point because while I love many aspects of this place, I could make more money in other SNFs because this is a non profit. I choose to stay here because there's really good things about this place and I think we can improve the crappy parts. But i do want the respect and I know I can get that elsewhere if my boss doesn't want to give it to me here."
JustNoTruth,fdn8dyg,t1_fdn1jl9,1578580042.0,"I'm a mental health professional, not a doctor. But if the husband of one of my patients asked me for a referral, I would absolutely say no unless that referral was to couples counseling. It's considered an ethical violation to provide care to someone who is not your patient and providing care includes coordination of care. You are not their provider and you haven't fully assessed them. It's also unethical for me to treat the patient and their husband as it's a conflict of interest.

I could justify giving him the phone number to a place I know that does good work, but I wouldn't call on his behalf nor provide any information to the place if they asked for it as he's not my patient. I work in a nursing facility now, so it's very common for me to be involved with the families of a patient. I've had family members who demanded I assist them with their problems and unless it directly involved my patient, I would have to say no."
JustNoTruth,fdn75ni,t1_fdn5qoj,1578579134.0,"False, SW that are employed by the hospital are bound under the same rules but there is a reason why it wasn't a violation to do what we did. I just don't remember what that reason was. So it's entirely possible that the scenario I gave in my previous comment could happen, thus giving a parent medical information that they shouldn't have access to. It's not likely, but it is possible.

But again, this all is just for the sake of discussion as to how it could be possible for a parent to be contacted when in reality someone else should be informed first. This post has pretty much established at this point that there's no way any midwife in the UK would have made a referral for the husband of one their patients to be assessed for autism. So there's no way that this autism team actually contacted the parents of the DH anyway."
JustNoTruth,fdn5nqh,t1_fdmljm8,1578577973.0,"Unless the person on the account is listed as an authorized contact. If the parents were ever authorized to know medical information, the medical team has no way of knowing if that consent has been revoked. A lot of times, patients will give consent and then hospital policy is specifically that the patient must revoke consent in writing for that person to be excluded off the record."
JustNoTruth,fdn57r8,t1_fdmnj49,1578577619.0,"I worked briefly as a social worker in the level one trauma center in my state. The police did not make phone calls to notify family members of an accident, we did. We had to dig through their belongings and find some way to get in contact with someone. If they were conscious, we could ask them who they wanted to be notified but that wasn't common. 

I didn't understand it at the time because I was still in school, but it wasn't a hipaa violation for some reason. Maybe because we didn't give any details, we just stated that there was an accident. It may have been something to do with health care decision making, as we needed someone to make decisions if the patient wasn't able to."
JustNoTruth,fdmaiti,t1_fdm94it,1578543951.0,"Well for me in the city I live in, I've transitioned through 3-4 different medical systems, each with their own separate chart and separate contact information. It's usually based on insurance coverage when I make the switch. I'm 26 now and I've updated my contact info in the current medical system I use to myself and my husband, plus my dad only as an emergency contact, not a full authorized contact as sometimes it's hard to get ahold of my husband.

But I've never bothered to go back and change it in the other hospital systems. It's a huge pain to get in contact with the records departments and get it changed, plus I'll never use those medical systems again unless my insurance coverage changes. If my insurance coverage changes, then I'll switch to one of the other systems and make sure the contact info is correct moving forward.

But if I was in an accident and didn't have my insurance card on me or I needed to go to the only Level 1 trauma center in the state, they probably don't have my husband's contact information because I never bothered to change it at a medical system I'm not likely to use. And I honestly don't care if the hospital contacts my parents in a situation like that, they'll call my husband and it'll be just fine.

For the purposes of this discussion, I'm assuming that this story is true and the DH from the OP thinks in a similar fashion. He doesn't have time to contact every doctor's office he's ever been to and update the contact info, and in the event of an emergency there will still be a person who can be reached. Hope that makes sense."
JustNoTruth,fdm8dri,t1_fdm7fri,1578542339.0,"Whoops, I misunderstood. My apologies. I thought you were saying that there's no universal charting system in the UK, so it's possible for parents to still be listed as contact information in one place but not in others. That's the only way I could see his parents having access to the info, he forgot to remove them from that medical record and the medical team contacted his parents as a result. It's a stretch, but it's possible."
JustNoTruth,fdm6xvj,t1_fdm6etc,1578541303.0,"Ah I must have missed this discussion but that's good to know. If I'm understanding your comment correctly, this means that it's possible that his parents were listed as contact people with the team that attempted to contact him. This detail could be plausible, though it seems like we've all kind of agreed that there's almost no way a midwife ever would have made a referral to an autism diagnosis team for someone who wasn't their patient, especially when that patient is the husband of the midwife's actual patient."
JustNoTruth,fdm6a03,t1_fdm5kod,1578540828.0,Entirely possible that I've met someone on the spectrum. I suppose I should rephrase a bit. I'll make an edit.
JustNoTruth,fdm63px,t1_fdm5ncl,1578540706.0,"It almost feels like a random detail inserted in to ""prove"" that he must be on the spectrum because he plays with Lego while in a doctor's appointment for his pregnant wife. That's the vibe I get from it."
JustNoTruth,fdm5y7w,t1_fdm4qte,1578540600.0,"As a rough guess based on how US medical systems tend to work: there's so many different medical groups and hospital systems that since you were a small child, your parents' contact information may still be in the various system in random places no matter how many times you say that you want to be contacted. It's almost inevitable that there will be an accident where a parent is contacted because human beings make mistakes and don't delete everything when they should.

That being said, I have no idea how the UK works. Is it all one big medical chart with everything in one place for every doctor in the UK to have access to and the authorized contacts should be fixed by the time a patient is 27? Then it doesn't make sense for the parents to be called. But otherwise, there's certainly a chance that a mistake was made."
JustNoTruth,fdm5cgv,t1_fdm4cml,1578540177.0,"There's some details like the husband playing with Lego that gave me the vibe. Like I said, not qualified by any means to make more than guesses. They're just vibes I feel from the writing style that might indicate presence on the spectrum. If I'm totally wrong about it, I'll apologize and cease my comments. But I'm glad that I'm not the only one who thinks the referral is weird."
JustNoTruth,fdm4ybp,t1_fdm409a,1578539905.0,"But from Bumblebee's post, the autism team contacted the ILs instead of contacting the DH.

JustNoTruth,fdm2w58,t1_fdm2tc5,1578538514.0,Okay I am so glad that I'm not crazy for wondering this.
JustNoTruth,fdm27sb,t1_fdm1kob,1578538059.0,"It feels really off. Maybe not an outright lie, but it just doesn't make complete sense. OP has claimed to be on the spectrum as well, and the writing style seems to lend itself to that but I honestly don't know as I really haven't interacted with someone on the spectrum. It would be nice to have someone on the spectrum comment on this post and offer their opinions on OP's possible mental state. I have training and education in it, but not enough that I feel comfortable saying that her belief that her son has autism is due to the way her mind functions as part of being on the spectrum.

Edit: I am rephrasing my comment to better clarify my experiences with individuals on the spectrum. In my capacity as a mental health professional, I have never interacted with someone on the spectrum and been aware that they were formally diagnosed as being on the spectrum. I cannot say for sure that I've never interacted with anyone on the spectrum."
Albuquerque,fdfr6eb,t3_el3uab,1578368212.0,So sorry. I just said goodbye to a dog I loved dearly and there's nothing I can say that you haven't already heard. I hope the memories of your baby carry you through this time and you find the strength to keep moving forward.

JUSTNOMIL,fdae8zj,t3_ek4ice,1578245131.0,"So it seems like the advice has been fairly divided up to this point. I'll add mine into the mix and you can do what you want with it.

If you disinvite her, there will be tons of drama and there will be people who side with her. I'm personally of the opinion that if she's going to act like an asshole, you don't reward her with an invitation at the wedding. But you have to understand that there will be drama and it will create an even bigger fight than the one you have on your hands right now. FSIL is also going to feel like she's the catalyst for this and it's going to put her in a crappy position, whether you intend for that to happen or not.

So here's what I'd suggest. Your FMIL is your FDH's problem, not yours. He needs to be the one to tell her that her behavior and her comments are disrespectful and they need to stop. Phrasing is key here. He should not threaten her. He should not say ""stop being an asshole to my wife about our wedding plans or I won't invite you to the wedding."" He should say that her behavior and comments hurt his (not yours) feelings and that if she's unwilling to be supportive, then he wonders if she's even someone who wants to be at his wedding. Put the onus on her, put the blame on her. Her actions make him think that she doesn't care about him. If he does this in front of a few people, even better. They can bear witness that he confessed to being scared of her not being there. He loves his mom so much, of course he wants her there! But if she's not being supportive of what he wants, he feels like she doesn't want to be there! No one would fault him for that, but it makes it clear that she needs to put on a happy face or gtfo.

If she reacts like an asshole, then she's effectively disinvited herself. Your witnesses saw, they can say that he tried so hard to explain how he was feeling and communicate his feelings and she reacted by throwing that fear back in his face. You won't walk away completely unscathed, but at least you have solid proof that you tried to handle this like adults and anyone who isn't isn't supportive of that isn't someone who needs to bear witness to your nuptials.

If she reacts appropriately and apologizes though, then that's great! You guys are figuring this out and she's going to work on improving her behavior. But if this occurs, think about throwing her a bone. This is her son's wedding. She loves her son dearly and she wants to be involved. If she's willing to make adjustments to her behavior, she should have that adjustment rewarded in some way. 

I won't tell you how to reward her, but I'll give you an example of what I've done with my own mom during my pregnancy. My mom and the rest of my family used to touch my bump excessively and it made me angry. I finally got fed up and yelled at everyone because no one respected my boundaries even after clearly stating them. After that, it got better. My mom especially was so careful and I could see that she was legitimately afraid that I would lose my shit again if she didn't respect my wishes. She was correct, and I really shouldn't have had to get angry over it, but she learned that her actions have consequences and she made a change in her behavior. So the next time I felt the baby kick, I put her hand on my bump myself and gave it a few minutes to see if baby would kick again. Of course baby didn't kick, but it showed my mom that her respect of my wishes earned her the reward of what she wanted to begin with. If you can find a way to apply that to your wedding based on her good behavior, you will simultaneously teach her a lesson about respect and show her that she can get what she wants if she goes about it in the right manner.

Good luck."

But I also did not see every comment that Jack wrote, nor did I explore his post history in any great detail. I noticed a general theme that he was significantly less supportive and was causing the tide of the sub to turn even more extreme, but I believed that he could be reasoned with because that's why we come here. Because we are more reasonable and realistic and can debate these things. I've been on the receiving end of comments on this sub that completely blew my beliefs out of proportion and I felt like people deliberately misinterpreted what I said in order to start a fight. I still believe that occurred to an extent with Jack. But comments like that are just too far for me. 

Has it become typical for YouTubers/news sites to steal stories and capitalize off those stories? Yes. Should everyone keep that in mind when they post on reddit? Maybe. I think it's good to keep in mind so you can emotionally prepare for the possibility of having your stories stolen and be prepared to deal with the repercussions of that. But do they deserve to have their stories stolen and have their story published in such a grotesque fashion and should they automatically assume that it will occur and think twice about posting on reddit? No. Absolutely not. It might be legal for them to do what they're doing, but it's completely unethical and we as a society need to find a way to make the legal system catch up with what is considered unethical and immoral. No one should ever expect this to happen and no one ever deserves for it to happen. Being emotionally prepared for something unfortunate to happen is always a good thing because you're hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. You're teaching yourself how to cope with problems before they get out of control. But that's different from deserving it.

I hope I'm getting my point across clearly. I don't blame drudge or anyone else who had stories stolen, I don't expect them to be prepared nor do I blame them for seeking support. I would just hope that they are emotionally prepared so when it happens to them, they can cope with it and not allow it to deter them from getting the support they came to JNMIL for. It's a violating experience to have their stories stolen and that's when they really need the support the most. If I'm as clear as mud, let me know so I can delete this for being too close to victim shaming. That's not what I want to convey but I'd rather delete it than have people misunderstand the difference between deserving to have their stories stolen versus being prepared that they might be stolen and knowing how to deal with it."

I really wanted to believe that he wasn't that bad and he just needed some gentle guidance to watch the way he said things. But Drudge never deserved what happened to her with her stories going on YouTube. She is a real human with some major problems and no one deserves to be blamed for seeking support. JNMIL has its issues as a sub, but Drudge is one of the reasons I still stick around and read."

cats,fcteo9s,t1_fctd3jo,1577940853.0,My vet never even gave us this option. I had no idea I could even ask for this. I took my dog in to the vet that morning and he was gone 14 hours later because we thought that we had no other options.
cats,fct8ykj,t1_fct4l81,1577936060.0,"This happened with our dog. He stopped eating and we thought he had a GI infection. They did bloodwork and called us with a DX of end stage kidney failure. They offered to hospitalize him and pump him with fluids because we were due to go on vacation the day we took him in and they wanted him to be there when we got back, but they never offered to teach us how to pump him full of saline at home. Is this something that you had to ask to learn or did your vet offer it to you? I would have given anything to have my dog around for one more Christmas."
Albuquerque,fcsg0ha,t1_fcsfbja,1577915990.0,Would you blame her? Hubby practically has her in a choke hold. I love that cat but she is definitely a daddy's girl and he was heart broken when we realized that she had gotten out the dog door.

cats,fckmmgs,t3_ehkqrg,1577728620.0,Luna was clearly very loved. We just put down one of our dogs that went into kidney failure and we have another old girl that I expect to be saying goodbye to soon. We think she's about 20 as well and she's been with my husband since he was very young.

JustNoTruth,fc9yzyk,t1_fc9m0nh,1577560320.0,"Maybe the other issue is the black and white thinking? Maybe it's not normal vs abnormal or healthy vs unhealthy. Maybe it's a spectrum and we have to identify where it is on the spectrum and decide how to deal with it from there.

It's so hard. It really is. I think so many people on the JNN want to help and want to make things better. But we didn't find the JNN because everything was good. And we want to be supportive, but we've got our own biases and experiences that affect the advice we give to others. We're imperfect humans trying to help imperfect humans. I would say that the best solution is to see a therapist, but I'm licensed as a therapist in my state (I don't offer therapy because I know I'm not fit for it and do something else within the field) and even therapists have biases and the suggestions they give are based on their own experiences too.

Maybe humanity causes the toxicity that occurs between humans. But how do we eliminate that toxicity and promote better well being for the future?"
JustNoTruth,fc9du88,t1_fc98c1b,1577551137.0,"I think sometimes this is hard to see when you're the one dealing with it. Maybe JNN commenters want to validate a person's feelings and let them know that they should take it seriously because the after effects of gaslighting are so damaging.

I have an uncle who is honestly just a dick. He loves to start fights and say shitty things like I'm a special snowflake because I don't think that Caitlin Jenner being trans is something worth being shitty about and calling her a HeShe and stuff. He makes jokes like ""what do tell a woman who has two black eyes? Nothing, you already told her twice."" and while he shares those views to an extent, they're gross overexaggerations on how he actually feels and even I understand that he really isn't that bad. But those I don't want my child to grow up hearing comments like that because even if they know he's not being that extreme, it exposes my child to bigotry and teaches them that it's okay to voice less extreme versions of those thoughts. But everyone in my family insists that's just how he is and it's not going to change and I know he doesn't mean harm by it, why let it bother me? It feels like I'm being conditioned to accept his shitty remarks and continue to reinforce his ability to say things like that. I don't want to restrict my uncle's access to my child, but I don't want to teach my child that comments like that are acceptable. It feels like I'm in an impossible situation where I'm risking alienating my entire family because I don't want my uncle to call Caitlyn Jenner a HeShe in front of my child. It's hard to tell if I'm making a big deal out of nothing or if I really am within my rights to tell my uncle to stop making bigoted comments if he wants to be aorund my child.

I also have a mother who guilt trips me because I take bodily autonomy seriously and won't allow anyone to touch my stomach. I won't force my child to hug people goodbye either when they arrive. Is it fair to my child to allow my mother to guilt trip them because my mom just loves her grand baby so much and wants a hug when we leave? Or am I within my rights to hold my mother accountable for the guilt tripping comments and insist that she respect my child's right to body autonomy?

Even the color one I can understand to an extent, though I haven't read the post you're referencing in your comment. I can't stand people who think that girls have to wear pink. I hate pink and everyone knows it. I'm prepared for people to buy pink clothes if I have a girl and if they're actually cute, I might even put my child in them. But my favorite color in the whole world is blue and my child already has plenty of little blue outfits regardless of knowing the sex because I don't buy into the concept of gender neutral clothing either. If my mother insisted on buying a ton of pink shit after finding out the sex and getting angry at me for refusing to put my daughter in it, eventually I'd get fed up with the arguments and lay down a hard line: Shut the hell up about the pink outfits or gtfo because I'm tired of you bugging me about it. 

Those are the situations that plague me and plague lots of other parents. We want so desperately to promote our child's well-being in ways that we weren't given an opportunity to do and we want our wishes as parents to be respected the first time we say something. I don't expect perfection, but I think that boundaries can be disrespected on even the smallest issue and it should still be dealt with. 


I think that people come to the JNN because their normal meter is broken and I think that they're receiving advice from people whose normal meter is also broken and you end up with a lot of extreme advice as a result. There are certainly a lot of people who fear monger and try to incite drama, but I think a lot of people who demand NC over a child wearing blue had an MIL who they believed was JY until their child came out as transgender and MIL flipped her lid and forced the child to cut their hair and wear a suit to recreate a picture from dad's childhood. They saw how bad it could get and they want to prevent someone else's child from suffering the way their child did."
JustNoTruth,fc97hyl,t1_fc9480o,1577548263.0,"I'm inclined to agree. But maybe that's the naive part of me trying to believe that most of the commenters on the JNN really do want to help. Sometimes I wonder if many of the people who comment actually do want to spark drama and fights. We have a problem with fake posters who want to start drama, how do we know that's not crossing over to the comments?"
JustNoTruth,fc905gm,t3_egq9rm,1577544899.0,"I struggle with this. I'm pregnant with my first child and my family can be incredibly toxic, but they're learning that I won't mess around when it comes to my children. I also have a SIL on my husband's side that struggles with addiction and I've watched as she subjected her own son to so much awful stuff that he's three now and thinks it's okay to strangle someone to get their attention.

But maybe that's the difference. I don't revel in the prospect of restricting my family's access to my child, I firmly believe that actions have consequences and it's my responsibility to protect my baby."
Albuquerque,fc74c3r,t3_egjwhc,1577497183.0,"Areas to stay: I suggest Nob Hill because it's so close to so many awesome restaurants/nightlife areas. It's not super close to any of the freeways compared to some areas, but it's still only about ten minutes or so. If you want to be closer to the freeways, id suggest maybe near Alameda/Paseo. That's a nice area.

Gruet: Never done it, have no opinion. I prefer DH Lescombes, which is formerly St Clair as far as local wine. 

Beer: Bosque is my favorite. Tractor is great as well. Kaktus is in Bernalillo but I love them."
