chicago,ff79nqr,t1_ff67k6e,1579643985.0,"There's no reason you can grade separate every crossing. It'd be expensive sure, but have you seen how much money we spend on roads. Devote a decent chunk of that to grade separation for a decade and boom you're good."
chicago,ff6323i,t1_ff61f42,1579617889.0,"Yeah red light cameras often convert T-bones into rear endings, which are much much less dangerous to the people involved."

MapPorn,fehlsnr,t1_fehdnvc,1579119142.0,"It's surrounded by a bunch of democratic districts, so it isn't creating a partisan advantage."
todayilearned,fea74tu,t1_fe756uv,1578945132.0,"UK mainline rail is actually very low fatality compared to most other countries, which is why I was shocked at the metro numbers."
todayilearned,fe74wvp,t1_fe6emaj,1578910068.0,That's a crazy high death rate for a metro system actually.
todayilearned,fe74lem,t1_fe6711p,1578909915.0,Also sucks since we have a 100% effective way to prevent this with grade separations.
todayilearned,fdposst,t1_fdp81vt,1578634959.0,No they didn't they appropriated more money for mass transit. Caltrans still spends the overwhelming majority of its money on roads. LA traffic is bad because road capacity scales incredibly poorly with population.
todayilearned,fdoyjns,t1_fdoye9f,1578615811.0,"You want to compare demolishing hundreds of homes, and building a gas line through someone's backyard? There's a reason the latter happens and the former doesn't anymore."
todayilearned,fdoyd48,t1_fdntf0x,1578615692.0,"Yes, but we're talking about highway expansion here, not gas construction. You're comparing apples to oranges."
todayilearned,fdnt2d9,t1_fdnsqyw,1578592268.0,We don’t. Find me a story of an agency demolishing hundreds of homes for a highway expansion these days. It’s incredibly rare. I think only Texas does it with any regularity. No DOT in a blue state is gonna do it. Especially not in a poor majority-minority neighborhood in a city with a massive housing crisis.
todayilearned,fdnsph5,t1_fdmp9sf,1578592062.0,I’m not going hunting elsewhere in this post for your argument.
todayilearned,fdnsnai,t1_fdmi8wm,1578592026.0,I mean they haven’t even built a proper system yet. Seriously trying would be spending hundreds of billions like they did on freeways. Considering how bad driving is for the air alone we should probably throw more money at it.
todayilearned,fdnsjxp,t1_fdmka9g,1578591971.0,That’s actually not unique most trolley systems were developed that way especially out west.
todayilearned,fdnsd5k,t1_fdmz7eh,1578591864.0,Yes eminent domain exists. Now go suggest to Caltrans to use it to take a couple hundred houses. They couldn’t even demolish ones they already owned to build an extension of the [710](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/11/28/710-freeway-extension-alhambra-south-pasadena/). It’s a different world than the 60s.
todayilearned,fdns2kz,t1_fdn07on,1578591693.0,"Yup, but his claims about civil society and unions have to deal with the issue that France tore out all their street cars despite having one of the strongest left wing movements west of the wall."
todayilearned,fdm9orj,t1_fdm8154,1578543314.0,"Clearly not, much better to spend the money trying to get fewer people to drive."
todayilearned,fdm75om,t1_fdm60g8,1578541457.0,"Yup, and quite often the density wasn't enough to support decent service."
todayilearned,fdm73kw,t1_fdm6cma,1578541414.0,"You'd have to take people's houses to expand that interchange, we basically don't do that anymore, and expanding probably means substantially rebuilding the interchange."

todayilearned,fdm5n7g,t1_fdm2eh4,1578540386.0,Yeah but that's them fighting Light Rail right now. And frankly the main problem with rail in Nashville isn't the Koch's it's the fact that Nashville has like zero density.
todayilearned,fdm5kv4,t1_fdm1rsk,1578540340.0,"I was speaking about the US, but even in America Philadelphia had a massive system survive into the 80s, and Boston, Philly, SF, and New Orleans all have surviving lines from the pre-war period."
todayilearned,fdlzw92,t1_fdlyn7t,1578536488.0,Which interchange are you talking about?
todayilearned,fdlzoyf,t1_fdl9m7j,1578536349.0,"Real problem with New Orleans streetcars, besides the fact the entire system was devastated by Katrina, is the fact the city refuses to buy modern low floor trams, and has insane closely spaced stops on its streetcar lines."
todayilearned,fdlz2eu,t1_fdlqi15,1578535915.0,"Streetcar systems in Vienna, much of Germany, Switzerland and Prague all run largely on legacy track from the pre-auto era. Your Amsterdam example is pretty anomalous. Western Europe largely tore out the streetcars, Eastern and Central Europe did not. Germany is a weird mix depending on if there was an extent rapid transit system, with those that didn't have one often getting a subway-surface system upgrade. Berlin's entire streetcar network for example is basically legacy track that the Soviets preserved as the western half of the city tore it all out!"
todayilearned,fdlyehi,t1_fdlxowa,1578535464.0,"Yes, but it also happened in cities and towns where GM didn’t do anything. General Motors was not the prime reason for the demise. To take some other examples DC’s streetcars were killed by legislative mandate, Philadelphia’s were pruned vis neglect and indifference from SEPTA, and SF’s that didn’t rely on non-bus compatible rights of way were replaced regardless of how busy they were."
todayilearned,fdlwrjl,t1_fdltgq2,1578534356.0,"Trolley companies were killed everywhere regardless of auto company involvement. Sometimes it was because the politicians wanted to get rid of them for cars, but mostly it was because their lanes weren't exclusive so even a small number of car commuters destroyed their ability to provide on time commutes, incentivizing more people to buy cars, making them later in a vicious cycle."
todayilearned,fdlwlnp,t1_fdlogl8,1578534245.0,"Widening highways through downtowns tends to be politically controversial if not disliked at a minimum, so maybe LA doesn't want to bulldoze a bunch of buildings downtown?"
todayilearned,fdlw8ul,t1_fdlu4h0,1578534005.0,The streetcar companies in Detroit were private companies.
todayilearned,fdlw73i,t1_fdlmx1j,1578533973.0,"Every city in the United States had a pretty developed street car network, basically everywhere tore them out for more car space and converted to diesel buses."

PublicFreakout,fcsz187,t1_fcswu9f,1577928674.0,"I mean you're thinking of street sweeping. I'm thinking of the fact the city's default way of dealing with trash is piling trash bags on the sidewalk, when the solution dozens of cities in Europe use is getting rid of a couple of street parking spaces and installing dumpsters."
PublicFreakout,fcss9gb,t1_fcso7q5,1577923821.0,Nothing is more NYC than the trash problem the city refuses to acknowledge because fixing it would require removing car parking from streets.
PublicFreakout,fcss3ld,t1_fcsmhlq,1577923700.0,There's a reason new systems around the world tend to be built with platform screen doors.

CitiesSkylines,fc3xu0h,t1_fc2htzr,1577401408.0,I think the bigger issue is that best practice at these point heavily discourages pedestrian crossings like these because they often significanty lengthen the amount of distance pedestrians have to walk.
CitiesSkylines,fc230fh,t3_eflcuk,1577338364.0,This is very Le Corbusier
CitiesSkylines,fc1zs5t,t3_efh9ha,1577334957.0,"Yeah if you don't have it yet, metro overhaul mod and longer trains from the workshop both help this issue."
therewasanattempt,fc1xddh,t1_fc1894g,1577332648.0,Yup probably pretty difficult to actually make a meaningful distinction between the three in size given differences in definition and accuracy of measurement.
therewasanattempt,fc17jb3,t1_fc16h76,1577310494.0,Metro NYC is very large though. If you use the Combined Statistical Area it tops out at fourth on that list.
