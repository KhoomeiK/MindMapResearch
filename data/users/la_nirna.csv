cats,ff46gxv,t1_ff311ho,1579556590.0,"oh this is what I was thinking of doing. good tip! 
I had my hand ripped and bitten badly 2 weeks ago and I could barely use it for a week. I don’t plan to relive the experience. I’m scared, tbh."
cats,ff46bkd,t1_ff2fdsx,1579556495.0,yes :( she gets into it with food but as soon as I move around her she runs away
cats,ff2f3kw,t1_ff2c3ey,1579503488.0,"thank you!

I guess I’ll have to wait it out, then. and lots of house vet visits. I hope I’ll manage to bring her to the ver to get neutered without ending up with my left hand impaired again 😩"
cats,ff2ezd8,t1_ff2c6s4,1579503356.0,that might be the issue. he smells his urine’s scent and thinks it’s fine to pee there again. if you purchase an odor remover for cats and dogs it might make the difference!
cats,ff2c5g3,t3_er8yp0,1579500327.0,how have you removed the scent? it might be he smells it and thinks it’s fine
cats,ff2bwig,t3_er90dr,1579500081.0,"I have a very scared young kitty. she’s not completely feral, but I believe she wasn’t socialized properly. 
I am not able to touch her unless she’s eating wet food and definitely not able to bring her to the vet alone.
can you share tips on how you did it?"
AskVet,fekcoal,t3_epdwjc,1579197279.0,"definitely go for a second opinion. 

my cat was terminally ill in the end, so it wouldn’t have changed the outcome, but I could have lost her far before if I would have listened to the “emergency” vet I went. everything was ok for him. I brought her the following week to my vet and I had to go STAT to the clinic and they weren’t sure she’d survive the night."
PuppySmiles,fejzobc,t3_epfjjq,1579189473.0,this made my day 200% better. belly rubs in return!!
TwoXChromosomes,fdqpcz5,t1_fdqmo0x,1578671990.0,"I did it for myself, and I’m much much happier and calm now! totally worth the money. and since it’s not driven by urgency, you can have it at a more leisure pace"
TwoXChromosomes,fdqm8wp,t3_emsdbm,1578670016.0,"therapy :)

you have already realized the pattern, for more introspection I highly recommend therapy for real. look for the different schools and find one that might click with your view of the self."
aww,fd2j9ah,t1_fd2idio,1578148025.0,"italy, definitely. those are all italian brands of flour."
cats,fbyaiog,t1_fbxuxpw,1577212078.0,"thank you so much ❤️

our paths crossed in the most unlikely way, I am happy I was able to give her the attention and calm she needed. she’s been a great companion to me, so I think we made both our lives better together.

I mean, her waking me up at 5.30 in the morning was the reason I was able to train for a whole year straight. outcome: I’m close to my fourties and I’ve never been fitter :D"
interestingasfuck,exshl61,t1_exsdf78,1566544761.0,"that’s how thursday is called in romanic languages, from latin Iupiter (Iovis being the genitive) and dies for day.

“giovedì” (italian), “jeudi” (french), “jueves” (spanish), “joi” (romenian)"
