How could you ever look at him again, let alone interact with him in a family way, knowing he did something so dumb and now your child is dead?  It's horribly sad all around.  I don't believe it's the cruise lines fault but I understand the family's reaction.  Juries may tend to award money in these cases.  They feel pity for the family and a corporation is just a faceless thing with massive insurance.  That's why lots of companies settle.  They aren't at fault but no one wants to argue over the corpse of a child."

This reminds me of the woman who dropped her kid in the wild dog exhibit at the Pittsburgh Zoo.  That absolutely wasn't the Zoo's fault but I fully expected her to sue because how else do you go on living knowing it was your fault your child was mauled to death?  How can a father continue to look at, talk with, etc his child knowing he did something so stupid that resulted in the of his child's child?  The brain can do an incredible job at protecting itself.  People can come to believe something that is completely false."

tumblr,fefae1r,t1_fef7rhg,1579051940.0,"Bit like having that ""The end is nigh"" guy following you around all day.  

Still, we were told pretty much every day during the cold war that we could die any second.  I remember the overriding feeling of doom.  Plus, pollution was going to kill us, the ozone hole (what happened to that thing) was going to kill us, Love canal was a drop in the bucket, Three mile island (we're all gonna die) was every nuclear power plant, etc.  Other generations seem to eventually get over the ""sky is falling"" thing so maybe these younger generations will.  I does make me wonder if we've done something and are still doing something to the younger generation when we are raising them that is making them more fearful and pessimistic.  I was doing my volunteer shift at the zoo this weekend and there was a woman there with two kids and I swear she never let go of the hand of one of the kids.  He was probably 2 or so and the other one looked to be 4 maybe.  She was trying to pick the 4 year old up while negotiating with the 2 year old to let go of her hand for just a second.  When she finally managed to get her hand loose, the younger one started to cry almost immediately.  Mom hurriedly took his hand, assuring him all was well.  I don't know anything about this particular family but I see this kind of thing a lot where the parents make it so the whole world revolves around the child and what it's doing or saying or thinking and, weirdly, doing that in a way that makes sure everyone around notices how child-centric they are.  They usually top it off with a few admonitions about getting too far away from Mommy or Daddy because something bad will happen to them.  It's just a weird dynamic I don't remember when I was growing up.  My parents didn't hover.  They weren't constantly monitoring my feelings or protecting me from the slightest hurt, real or imagined.  It feels like we aren't fostering independence in the younger generation and that is doing them a disservice because they seem to have a hard time adulting.  Of course, I could just be talking out of my ass.  Wouldn't surprise me."
tumblr,fef5yp3,t1_fef3hwm,1579048971.0,"When I was growing up we were told any second we could die in a fiery nuclear explosion or live a short, painful existence in the fall out before we died of radiation poisoning.  Oh, and an ice age and out-of-control population growth and super germs and on and on.  We got past it.

I'd guess that very few people are worse off than the people who lived in the same location 500 years ago and most of us are far, far better off.  Most of the problems we have can be fixed if people want to put in the effort but it seems so much easier and, oddly, more satisfyingly dramatic for people to complain that all hope is lost.  Case in point, want cheaper houses then stop buying the super expensive ones.  Builders don't want endless inventory because their houses are overpriced.  Is it really so great to live in San Francisco or New York City that you are willing to pay a million dollars for a closet?  Start exerting some control over you life instead of just being swept along.  This may require some work to get your politicians, neighbors, etc to do the right thing but it will be worth it.  Or you can just continue to complain and be miserable."

Mine has a fairly mild case.  His nickname at the shelter was Splat.  He has problems controlling his back end so he never jumps down from very high because his back legs don't support him and he is all over the place when he runs down stairs.  He and his litter mates also had severe eye infections when they were very small.  All his brothers and sisters got better and had no eye damage but my little guy has scars over his eyes.  He can see light and some movement directly in front of him and a little more movement on the periphery.  He's feisty around the other cats, taking swats at them that are generally off by a few inches because the other cat has moved since he pegged their position."

interestingasfuck,fe6220d,t1_fe2v2yf,1578880030.0,"Do you use any products with palm oil in them?  Does your family?  If so, can you track that palm oil through the supply chain back to its supplier?  Most of us can't and many aren't even aware of the problem.  We depend on corporations to ""do the right thing"".  We also have 401K plans that are invested in mutual funds that buy shares of companies that make products using things like palm oil.  We make a huge, boisterous demand that only sustainably-produced palm oil be used, which is more expensive and reduces company profits, then complain that our 401K mutual funds aren't returning enough money, thus pushing companies back to buying the cheap non-sustainable palm oil so they can show more profit, and round and round it goes.  We often don't see the ripple effects of what we do.

Palm oil plantations produce a tremendous amount of oil per acre.  It would take considerably more cleared land to replace it with something like cottonseed or soybean oil.  I'm not sure that's the way to go.  I remember watching something about Madagascar and how lots of the forest had been cut down to put in this wonderful new cash crop.  That cash crop was used to make recyclable shipping boxes needed to ship all those products we buy online.  It was depressing to know that trying to do something right (recycle) was resulting in habitat loss for things like lemurs.  We are going to have to come to terms one day with the fact that the only way to fix most of these problems is to consume less.  We have a tendency to forget the reduce part of reduce, reuse, recycle."

They have one of the most dangerous jobs on the planet with a very high chance of being killed.  They are often not paid by the government for the work they do and subsist on money donated to various mountain gorilla protection organizations.  There is a widows fund that you can donate to that supports the families of fallen rangers.  Often these men are the sole breadwinners in their families so their deaths are extremely hard on their survivors.  They are paid about $250 a month, which is considerable for the area, but most people don't have as dangerous a job.  They have to contend with bushmeat hunters, charcoal vendors, illegal pet trade poachers, random militia members from the on-going wars in the area, illegal settlers, unbelievably rugged terrain, disease, etc.  Drop them some coin if you can.
