askscience,feoy7to,t3_ep11eg,1579307969.0,"You need to consider that in ancient times only 7 metals were known: gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, mercury, lead. Gold and silver were useful for ancient peoples for ornamentation, but not much else. Lead can be used for its weight to make bullets/beads, and can be rolled into sheets and made into piping, but not much else. Mercury is a liquid at room temperature. Tin isn't very useful by itself, it is very brittle, but mixed with copper yields bronze. This leaves us with just copper/bronze and iron for describing these ages as these were the first general purpose metals that humans discovered and developed metallurgical methods around for."

Sometimes a lack of uniformity is okay, for instance [WP:COMMONNAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_titles#Use_commonly_recognizable_names) requires that titles of articles use the name that we commonly know the subject by, even if the name itself is disputed and in other places policy would dictate to use a different name. We also have a policy for enforcing British English on articles that specifically have to do with British topics and vice versa with American English, and everything else just being sticking with whatever spelling the article was initially written in."
