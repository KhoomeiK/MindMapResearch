Naturewasmetal,fekbkch,t1_fej3v74,1579196619.0,"I see what you're talking about but you're missing the point.

Elephants, as a cosmopolitan keystone species, certainly are important to their native ecosystems. They are the 'heavy-lifters' and dominant megaherbivores. Similarly, they are generalistic feeders mostly controlled by their K-species characteristics rather than by predation.

It is hard to know if elephants and mammoths would interact identically within their ecological communities. Hogs, now introduced to the U.S., are an invasive, but are superficially similar to peccaries that went extinct at the time of the mammoth.

You say, *We've arguably already imposed our will on much of the natural world; rewilding has the explicit intent of restoring the natural world to the point that we can reduce our need to manage wildlife populations. Were it not for us killing off megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene and further pillaging the natural world for millennia afterwards, these ecosystems would not need our help.* But these aren't actually scientific facts, you're jumping to conclusions that can't be totally drawn. We don't know what would have been had humans not entered into the Americas, and similarly, ecosystems do not 'need' mammoths to carry on. 

Whatever ecological losses occur when elephants are lost, have already occured, and thus any efforts to reintroduce their family would be to restore Pleistocene conditions and not to conserve the fauna we still have because they survived for millenia afterwards and thrived in high numbers for much of that time.

It is particularly false to suggest that the world would have remained the same over the Holocene inter-glacial. To determine what a biodiverse Holocene should look like, we should look at past inter-glacials -- times wereby forest naturally expands -- for the world did indeed change 12,000 years ago.

There's clearly an equilibrium present for extant biota. To suggest there isn't is to pretend this world is the same one of 12,000 years ago. While a short geological time, life can adapt rather quickly, and there is a balance present without rewilding occuring.

We must have a respect for natural ecology and native ecosystems/species. This rewilding offers none of the sort. We should never use *our* judgement upon what is ecologically 'better' to the extent that we are willing essentially construct a new ecosystem with African elephants, dromedary camels, and Siberian tigers, animals that aren't native to this land. Should we truly conserve nature, we conserve that which is natural.

Because afterall, we want the world to be biodiverse but to respect the individual nayive ecosystems of it. That's what makes the world so special. It's not an experiment where the goal is to 'win' and maximize numerical biodiversity -- a non-native is in and of itself a detriment to ecological intergrity.

Mammoths were native and thus could be considered. Unnatural fauna for the purpose of *artificially* expanding grassland based upon what we think should be is not favorable."
Naturewasmetal,fek03b4,t1_fej863s,1579189729.0,South Africa does not generally experience temperatures comparable to the U.S. It would be unwise to place a threatened species in a habitat which is only non-lethal.
Naturewasmetal,fejzxja,t1_fejet60,1579189631.0,"Yes, there's considerable evidence. There's also evidence for climate change. In the way that you say many fallen herds of mammoths show few sogns of butchering, many of the mammoths show no signs of ecological stressed that would be associated with climate change.

Similarly, there isn't any particular reasom why mammoths would have suffered extinction at the Holocene. The ice age was characterized by cold glacial periods followed by intermitent warmer inter-glacials. This warm period was no different from the others and, since mammoths survived all other climatic changes (and presumably were a fairly adaptable species), there is no reason they should have fallen here.

Now. One important thing to remember is that their extinction wasn't very fast. They went extinct over a considerable piece of time in relation to how they all could have been killed off. We know that mammoths numbers had steadily declined at the warming, as they should, and so their populations were vulnerable -- thereafter, they went extinct when humans had arrived.

It is mostly a given that both factors would have played some role, though to which extent either was fundamental is harder to tell. Humans are apex predators, and they could and were regularly predating upon mammoths. A vulnerable ecosystem with now an *entirely new apex predatory force*, should be very good at causing extinctions, afterall."

Lions do indeed have very brutal and violent lives. 

Your believing in rigid, almost monarchal social structures of lions is not unfounded, and I understand why you believed it. As the 'King of Beasts,' lions are consistently portrayed as living in this monarchy, where the male is king of the pride and defends it, the females hunt, etc. And while lion society is definitely reminiscent of a monarchy, but just like a real monoarchy it is more complex than that, as in nature, there aren't rules. There have been powerful coalitions of males who've ruled more than 10, close or more than 20 prides.

To adress your further questions: firstly, I couldn't really put a number on it, I'm don't really have one from any study in my head and I wouldn't want to give you just a random estimate. If I had to say.. most males are strong, and thus pass on their genes  because if they aren't strong, they're killed. From their births, 80% of lions will die before adulthood, and around 60% will die in sub-adulthood alone. So, there are extreme naturally selective pressures which make sure lions are fit. One could say that the lions who son't breed are those that are unfit and are likely to be killed. 

As for where I get all of this, it's all from a variety of sources, so yes it most comes from scientific papers and studies."
Dinosaurs,fecqw7u,t3_eofvdv,1578981277.0,awesome. What's top right?
zoology,fe5xhi6,t3_ensxnn,1578877129.0,"You phrased this question in a way that's kind of hard to understand for me haha but I'll do my best.

So what I think you're asking is what life is like for nomadic lions, ones who aren't dominant and thus don't lead prides, and if they lead a less violent life.

Firstly, males are rarely solitary, so a nomadic male is really a band of nomadic males, brothers who share a close bond. These brotherhoods are very important relationships for lions.

So with that solved, how is it more complex than this, and what is the answer to your question?

The answer I believe lies within some of the fallacies in your question. The life of a male lion isn't as simple as leading a pride or not leading one. Male lions come, and go. 

Lions may lead no pride, or conversely, multiple prides. Males who lead prides do not necessarily stay around said pride consistently, they may roam elsewhere within their territory for long periods of time or similarly go to and fro between other prides that they rule.

Some gangs of males might never lead a particular pride, but still they can kill a reigning male, breed with his females, and then hit the road.

So, these are the complexities of lion society.

Now, there are some lions who are not dominant, and thus never lead a pride and never breed. 

How these lions come to be and how they live being in question, lions have no choice to but to be in direct competition with other male lions for territory. When they are roaming, they must roam through other males' territory. Wherever they roam about, other males will come and attack them. Since males that aren't dominant are ones that lose these fights, they'll probably be killed by another male.

To answer your other question, it's unlikely they'd ever choose not to be in competition with other males, because while they would certainly be reluctant to challenge larger or more numerous males, lions are naturally very agressive and territorial, and like I said, they don't need to be the ones doing the attacking.

So in totality, the situation you describe isn't likely, because a male lion can't just simply not compete, he may not ever lead a pride or breed, but will probably be killed by other males at some point whether he likes it or not. If this situation were to happen, another male would find ans kill him, regardless of his wishes."

zoology,fdk7th5,t1_fdjvnm7,1578498049.0,">all remaining differences are physiological.

Exactly. And this is my point. We have to ask, what is more important to a lion being a lion, its actual pure genetic code (pretend to judge this as independent of morphology) or all of the characteristics that allow it to behave as a lion in an ecosystem.

And still, I think we definitely disagree on what deems a species extinct. Extinction is usually deemed as no longer having any living representatives. Which is why our examples are conventionally considered extinct. Do you perhaps have a link to an article which might bolster this point? Because while I have heard many times of a distinction between the end of a lineage and the end of a species on the physiological level, I have never encountered the former to be the sole interpretation as you are suggesting.

Maybe I shouldn't call it complicated. Maybe I should call it overly technical. Yes, extinction on the physiological level isn't as objective but it is infinitely more biologically useful. I don't think that 2.5% of neanderthal DNA is even a very useful inclusion in the understanding of why they ended, aside from asserting that they did indeed interbreed to some extent, because at that level anything that behaves/moves/acts like a neanderthal did, is extinct.

I think we can both agree with the fact that the definition of extinction I am using is more subjective than the one you are using.

I follow your reasoning, and I understand what you are saying, but the definition that you are using for extinction is so complex it is just useless. If we were to use your definition of extinction, and follow a technical extinction of genes as the dying out of a lineage, then the word would become to general.

On a technical biological level, you're correct that a lineage does not die out if it had hybridized. By that way, its genetic material lives on.

The problem is that if we treat extinction like this it has little to no use in zoology and especially conservation. Because functionally, that doesn't really matter, as if no living morphological representative of species exists, it is for all intents and purposes extinct.

Here's the problem, we're talking about taxonomy, and taxonomy is not fundamental of the laws of nature but organizational for man. Under your view of taxonomy, organization is made significantly harder.

The definition of an extant animal is having living representatives.

Your mammal/human and bird/dinosaur bit is innacurate, because those parent groups to which an organism belongs to, not adjacent taxa like us and neanderthals.

Children of neanderthals *do* stop being neanderthals. They retain DNA from neanderthals but are no longer taxonomically so, and more importantly in every concievable physical way they are human and not neanderthal. 

We are talking about minor traces here.

Cave bears and neanderthals are extinct. You will not find a paleontologist who will argue this. That's because they have no loving representatives, yes their DNA lives on but in such an insignifact way that their form no longer exists.

zoology,fdi8ovf,t3_ekdbdg,1578437737.0,"Cougars and cheetahs are relatives of one another, in fact the cheetah's closest relative is the cougar.

In terms of behavior, both cougars and cheetahs are hypercarnivorous predators, specializing in hunting medium-large ungulates. They ambush their prey into a sprint (the difference being that the cougar must approach their prey more closely, and are less cursorial, whereas the cheetah obviously is a runner).

Both cheetahs and cougars are mostly solitary (however cheetahs are more social, especially the males).

They both have light, flexible skeletons and are extremely muscular - most of which is made up of explosive, fast twitch fibers. Their skeletons are light so that they can be agile, and so that muscle composes most of their build to be as explosively powerful as possible for their mass. As cats, this is their specialization, explosive power that sacrifices most if not close to all endurance.

Compared to cats of the genus *Panthera*, they both have relatively shorter muzzles and more rounded skulls.

=========================================

Aside from these, though, the two cats are quite different. In fact, while the cougar is similar to most other cats, the cheetah is highly derived and specialized. Cheetahs are runners. All of their adaptations are for running. A very small skull that is light and aerodynamic (but less robust and powerful). Their limbs are particularly long and thin, and their forearms are very long compared to their upper arms -- traits for this specialized cursoriality. Their claws are only semi-retractable, sacrificing the bladelike sharpness for traction. Cougars are more heavily built, for grappling and struggling with prey, and their claws retractable to be kept sharp for tearing into or latching onto large prey.

In most ways, the cheetah is the least like other cats, and in most ways, the cougar is more similar to the cats of *Panthera* than he is to the cheetah. The cheetah in many ways as well is more similar to a cursorial canid than to the other big cats."

This is something that happens with other species too. Cats (until the end Pleistocene) evolved to fill the apex predatory niche in most environments. In the past, this niche was filled by a variety of taxa, but cats outcompeted them.

So, it's not that weird, really. There are some species that represent the only living relative of larger groups, notably the tuatara, who is the only member of its entire order."

Disclaimer: not all scientists agree (as with most things) on this animal's taxonomy - notably, it is still listed as a subspecies of *Ceratotherium simum* by the IUCN but this could mean little, as the IUCN tends to recognize species as distinct a time after they are determined, and usually does not adress new species found in this way very easily, for conservational reasons of not wanting to adress a new animal that must then be given separate funds."

I don't expect to change your view so that you'll be a more caring person.

Instead, I at least hope to change your view that you can be changed. No information can be presented to you for you to change your morality, because this is so inherently subjective that it is virtually entirely independent of fact or information.

Nobody can say anything to make you a good person. That's on you. If you genuinely don't care, deep down, for anything after you're gone, then you're just cold, and my only advice would be to hide your sociopathy so that others at least (wrongfully) treat you with care."

The world will always matter, it should matter to all of us now and forever. The world is more important than you or I. The world matters whether or not you exist to mourn it. **The world should exist long after we are alive.**

You should care about the world after you are dead because the world matters whether you are dead or not dead. It sounds like you're just incredibly selfish.

We care about the world we leave behind *selflessly* and altruistically because ***the world is important regardless of our selves and separate of any personal benefit.***

If the only reason you care about anything is because of personal happiness (either things that benefit you or avoiding negative **emotions** that would come along with literally watching the world go to shit) then I really think you're beyond being changed, because you're looking for a reason regarding how it'll benefit you **when it never will.**

This is a question of morality. You're asking why you should be caring person if it won't do anything for you. Well, your flaw is in the question. There is no logical reason that will do anything for you. You can either be a POS or a solid individual. Your choice."

So Hyenas didn't survive in Africa because competition was lesser, but rather because on a broader level, Africa's megafaunal diversity just didn't suffer many losses, and kept much grassland habitat unlike southern Asia.

Likewise, I believe Homotherium migrated west earlier in time. Maybe the forest theory makes the most sense. All of the animals who failed to make it across, seemed to have been grassland specialists, afterall. But maybe not, as many grassland specialists *did* make it across as well."

Naturewasmetal,fczhh3r,t1_fczcuqc,1578101352.0,"Awesome post.

The biogeographical segregation which occured between eastern and western Beringia at the Pleistocene is puzzling indeed. Animals like woolly rhinoceroses and spotted hyenas were successful in Eurasian Beringia, but never crossed, and the same is true for species like the ground sloth and short faced bear who were successful in American Beringia but never migrated east.

Now if Beringia were all one ecosystem, one massive grassland/steppe, one would edpect usual naturally selective pressures to occur whereby species were outcompeted on both sides. But they weren't. This may indicate that the eastern and wester lands differed in habitat, or maybe there was some type of border in central Beringia such as a forest of some kind. It's truly hard to know."

It isn't abour camouflage being necessary, it's about bright colors beinv advantageous.

But that just isn't reasonable. They'd be at an immediate disadvantage.

Elephants don't need camouflage, but haven't any ostentation features... so I'm not sure why you used them. They're also 30 times larger than their largest predators."
