I would have suited up as being in blues is a more professional attire for visiting a family or girlfriend that is graduating.  Unless he was making a quick trip there on his way home from work, then I would be more accepting of this.

I would even accept he got back from an deployment, and visiting his sister or girlfriend on his way home.

These AFIs, AFMANs, technical orders,etc are there for a reason.  Most of it is clear while there is some instructions that is subjective.  
Is it acceptable to lighten up on AFI 36-2903? would we lighten up on AFMAN 91-203?  How about AFI 91-101?  How about when QA is around while you're working? (This more so applicable to flight line) 

My point is do the right thing, even when no one is looking.  In this video, the people around him dont know he isn't suppose to be in his ABUs but we all know not to wear the ABUs off base unless traveling to and from place of duty and making a quick stop.  If he was my troop and I saw this video and recognized him, I would just sit down with him and have a mentoring session and walk away from it without giving any kind of paperwork.  If anyone has ever worked for me, I am the most lenient person you can work for as long as you followed the AFI, AFMAN, T.Os.   I'm not the person to give you a shitty task without me there doing it with you.  I have been mentored many times, that I have other tasks I need to do and leave the work to airmen, I'm person that will be with you doing the same shitty task, even if I think its stupid but one thing I was taught was follow the rules."

 In tech school we could not go off base unless we were in any combination blues during phase 2.  Phase 3 were then allowed to wear civvies off base.  Same with phase 4 and 5. Only difference was curfew changed  and phase 5 there was no curfew on weekends.

P2- civvies cloths only in the dormitories.  Utility uniform anytime outside dormitories.   Any combination blues off base. Be back on base and in the dormitories  by 11pm

1.  utility uniforms is not authorized for wear outside of a military installation UNLESS you are driving to and from the base, making a quick stop at but not limited to grocery store, fast food joint, etc.  In BMT, they preached this.  It's ok to wear the utility uniform off base if your going home and need to pick up quick items like bread, milk, fast food.  It was also ok during lunch to eat off base in uniforms as long as the place was not a suit and tie type place.  

2.  For this he needs to be in service dress.  That is the appropriate uniform for this public event.

From her reaction he's been gone a while,  so maybe or more than likely he is fresh out of tech school.  Anyone who went to any Air Force Tech school knows, you can't wear your utility uniform off base.  When they reach a certain phase, they can go off base but had to be in any combination blues.

If your not going to protect yourself at least call someone to protect your sister.  There is help.  Your not the only one that is going through this.  It takes courage to step up to someone who is abusive.  You may regret it but you have to tell yourself it is for my sisters, mom and myself.  It will also get him the help he needs.

Be the real man in the household and step up. Do the right thing.  I had a friend, who's husband was a abusive,  she didn't know as her kids thought it was normal so didn't say anything.  Her husband killed their son.  He was I think 7 years old.  Started beating him and shook him to death.  He's now doing life in Maryland.  Protect your family."

That basket the guy was in, it took a significant dip.  When the back tires came down. Again it wasn't much on the base, but for the basket, it was enough to throw him off.  Now imagine, someone 60 feet in the air.  Not aware of a drop off like that, because you can still operate and drive around while in the lift position.

When I was taught, JLG corporation training rep said its recommended to get back to ground level before moving the equipment.  You have better visual of your surrounding and less risk falling."

OSHA,ffd1eaj,t1_ffcxdhg,1579811506.0,"Correct, their method to replicate the said scenario was wrong.  When the boom is fully extended and your 30 feet off the ground.  From the counterbalance weight to ground maybe 4ft from the ground. It has a 4ft to hit the ground and bounce back.  That bucket at the end that is 30ft up.  Has 30ft of play.  What is 4 ft on one end maybe 15 feet on the other end which is more than enough to launch you.  Maybe not 200feet but they should have gone with plausible instead busted. 

You can find YouTube videos of people  getting thrown off a bucket lift with the counterbalance dropping a foot.  And that's with the boom retracted and bucket a few feet off the ground.  I feel sure if conditions were met.  It would be possible.

[example 1](https://youtu.be/AcJQOWLxjFc)

Biggest thing when operating a boom lift is to be aware of the center of gravity on the main part.  As you lift and go up, you are changing that CoG.  If you rotate the whole thing 90°, your center of balance has now shifted.  Best practice is to stay parallel with the base. 0° or 180°.  CoG shifts but maybe minimum.  Once your 90° or 270° your center of balance is now close to one side of the vehicle down below you.  This is where you have a better chance being catapaulted off.  A drop off simply as a curb can be enough to eject someone from the basket

It’s imperative to keep the center of gravity as low and as centered as possible when operating the aerial lift because one fast turn or one pothole can cause the entire machine to tip over."

 One guy I saw, was in the army air corp. Before it switched to the air force.  He spent time on Johnson Atoll ( I had did some research and Johnston atoll came up and i asked him you mean Johnston? He said no. I asked the family members and they said when they requested his military records, that part wasnt in there but they remember growing up hear about it) South Korea war veteran, a uranium miner, police chief, fire fighter, and animal rescue. I learned of the  rest at his funeral service. Lived to be 89 years old.  I last visited on a  wednesday, a week before Christmas, he passed that night.  He had 3 things he was worried about.  1. His daughter being taken care of, 2.  Military honor service. And 3. Did God forget about him. 

That evening, my last visit with him, before I left,  I reassured him all those had been taken care of.  My last words to him was ""God has not forgotten about you.  He is calling you now.  It's ok. Your daughter is taken care of you paid off her house and in return she took you in to take care you.  Be with your wife, grandson, and your parents.  Your job here is done.""  

Veterans most likely wont talk about their experiences with family members bc they are afraid they wont understand but they will open up to another veteran who can relate and or understand.  Some vets will open up to family members."

This can make them think they are just a burden to you and may put them in a deeper state of depression and possible make them think that they are a burden on others and may contemplate suicide....cue suicide bot....
 You are on the right track but I would leave the I cant handle it right now out.  I love you and and we need to go find some professional help. When someone is depressed, you need to choose your words. 

Just flat out ask the dreaded question.  ""Are you going to kill yourself?""  Depression can lead to these thoughts and asking is by no means of putting these thoughts in their head. You cant put a thought in their head if it's already there.  If they say yes.  Call 911 then and there and wait with them.  Do not leave them alone even if going to bathroom.  Keep them in eyesight. 

 If they are not, tell them I will help you and I think we need to also find someone who can help you more on the professional level.  And remind them you are there for them.  You can also use a white lie and have some phone numbers available and can say when I'm depressed I call the samaritan hope line  and give them the phone number.  Call it for them.  Also have the suicide help line on hand too. And there are some youth help lines too.  Be prepared.

If you dont already have a vehicle in the states, and you say you are going to be stationed in korea, check out the Military overseas autosource.  They may be able to get you in a new vehicle at a reasonable price and it will be ready for you to drive when you arrive back to the states."
