YouTube has a lot of videos on ""power 2.0"" that explain it well. 

Might be worth looking at a thrust tutorial as well. You can adjust if you want all your throat pointing forward (can go faster, accelerate forward and backwards faster), sideways (can turn much faster, important with bigger ships), or up down (good for evasive maneuvers).

Typically fighters need a lot more turning capability because you need to keep your target in your view, while miners need more forward motion so they can GTFO, but really depends on playstyle and whether you PvP."
