YouShouldKnow,ffco645,t1_ffcgdpf,1579803629.0,"Sorry my friend, he's wrong. Crystallization has nothing to do with fakeness, and everything to do with oversaturation of sugars and particulates that seed the process. As for viscosity, just turn the jar upsidedown, if it takes time for pouring to start and end, it's more likely real."

AskReddit,ff1w694,t1_ff1thin,1579487550.0,"When people say rightly say overpriced, they mean the price is excessive because it capitalizes on distortions of valuation by the consumer, which may come in forms of ignorance, hype, misadvertisement, anticompetitive practices, fraud, etc. Of course over time these distortions revert to free market balance, but at any given moment a price can be unfair. In the same way EMT has been debunked at the short time scale, so too is pricing efficiency for anything."

MMA,fetqut2,t3_eqgbdw,1579378544.0,"Remember to have fun. You are doing something that is a fantasy for many people, and a visceral thrill ride in itself. Every moment, bad or good, suck it in and savor it, from nerves to fight to conclusion. The worst way to lose in there is to regret doing it; don't let that happen. Make memories."
gamedev,fedt3ap,t3_eoc4t9,1579019307.0,"As a producer for many engineering teams, my golden rule is this: optimize only if there's a tangible effect on game experience for non-programmers, or if it allows iteration on design that needs questions answered.

Requirements in game development change too often, which is why hacking often is as effective as engineering."

WTF,fds7p2z,t1_fds5joj,1578696231.0,"> A placebo can help with pain, but it's not physically doing anything, just psychologically making him feel better.

Correct, so if there is a culturally attuned non-invasive non-pharma and relatively cheap placebo treatment that works, that sounds like a win. Constructing a proper placebo clearly makes a difference.

> insurance company wants to minimize the amount of money they pay treating you

I'm not talking about insurance companies, I'm talking about big pharma, who want you solve placebo-able problems with addictive drugs with chemicals they can justify charging a lot more for, and push doctors to prescribe."
WTF,fdr3psk,t1_fdqttk7,1578679100.0,"Acupuncture is the only treatment that helped my dad's back pain without drugs. Diet and exercise are preventative to back injury, not curative. Speaking of company incentives, you should realize who wants you taking drugs for everything."
WTF,fdqrbwy,t1_fdqpvs5,1578673213.0,"The whole world is built on an elaborate network of placebos. Is your comment here going to change any minds? Probably not, but it feels as good to post it as if it did. Placebo. 

What's important is cost effectiveness, if it performs as well as real treatments, then it is productive. But soon as a yogi charlatan charges an arm and a leg for it... well again, cost effectiveness."

funny,fdb1mq6,t1_fdarfzw,1578252674.0,"> Would you ever post a video of a 25 year old man and call him a ""boy"" in the title?

Yes, I've absolutely called young-looking men ""boy"", ""kid"", ""bro"", ""punk"", ""young man"", ""lad"", etc. It isn't always to demean, and certainly not because of gender. It is usually to express age difference and convey a sense of vitality and spunk that I, getting older, start to lack."
