>""More problematic for the Senator in Birkenstocks is the little-known fact that Bernie Sanders himself voted twice in support of regime change in Iraq. **In 1998 Sanders voted in favor of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998**, which said: “It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.”

>""Later that same year, Sanders also backed a resolution that stated: “Congress reaffirms that it should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic  government to replace that regime.” These measures gave congressional backing for the CIA’s covert plan to overthrow the Hussein regime in Baghdad, as well as the tightening of an economic sanctions regime that may have killed as many as 500,000 Iraqi children. The resolution also gave the green light to Operation Desert Fox, a four-day long bombing campaign striking 100 targets throughout Iraq. The operation featured more than 300 bombing sorties and 350 ground-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, several targeting Saddam Hussein himself.""

First let me say that I forgot to mention that Semyon Mogilevich was once the FBI's #1 most wanted.  It was Sessions, his future personal lawyer, who removed him from the most wanted list on the pretext of 'oh, we woould never be able to make an arrest anyway' when he was in the FBI.

Now let's go in another direction.  Mogilevich's 'business interests' include sex trafficking, Eastern European models.  Mogilevich, an Israeli citizen, is also reputed to be an Israeli intelligence asset, just as mobster Felix Sater is an American intelligence asset.  Robert Maxwell, the father of Ghislaine Maxwell who was Jeffrey Epstein's procurer, possibly also an Israeli asset, and who is now reputed to be in hiding in israel, was a 'business associate of Mogilevich's in the Eastern European organised crime syndicates.  By some accounts it was R. Maxwell who introduced Trump to Eastern European oligarchs.  

I can't draw the lines, but from Mogilevich, sex trafficking, intelligence, to Jeffrey Epstein doesn't seem too big a stretch.

And then there's this: Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, took campaign money from Lev PArnas who reputedly got it from Dimitri Firtash,  Guess who Firtash was passing it along for ?  If you guessed Semyon Mogilevich, you're today's winner!  Extra bonus points if you're thinking *They all took campaign money from Parnas/Firtash*.
