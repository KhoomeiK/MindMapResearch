Tried language schools but they were too boring.

 So rn my reading, writing, vocab, grammar are weak, but my pronunctiation, listening, ""fluency"" (or automaticity) is native level. 

Rn i started reading young adult fiction classics.
Reading aloud. Adding vocab to anki (type in answer mode to practice spelling). Writing summaries of chapters to practice grammar."
