BPDmemes,fflu8ao,t3_eu3asg,1580044269.0,Ugh but how. The impulse control problems are too real. I experienced some pretty major trauma recently and in the midst of my pain I texted my ex who I went no contact with a few months ago. Didn't go over well.

ptsd,fdjo69a,t1_fdh75ip,1578480456.0,Thank you for sharing your experience. I hate wishing for time to pass quickly to dull pain.

relationship_advice,fd8gu99,t3_ek7tvr,1578218208.0,"I'm so so sorry for your loss. So sorry. 

I lost my mom to suicide when I was 17, found her 3 days dead in the tub when I happened to be coming down from mushrooms. 

All I can tell you is what not to do.

Don't go back to school a week later so you can randomly break down in the hallways or run in a panic from class.

Don't use drugs or drink to escape the grief.

Don't go without therapy or professional support for 10 years. 

Don't blame yourself for any of it. It's not your fault. You couldn't have done anything differently. 

Don't repress anger if it comes up. Don't hold on to blame at him. Don't internalize anger.

Don't believe you're resigned to the same fate.

Echoing others, surround yourself with your support system. Seek therapy ASAP.

Hang on. It's it's own brand of grief, but you WILL get through."

Advice,fd1lpi6,t1_fcxb24b,1578133021.0,"It went so well. I didn't stutter once or get choked up.

I'm so sorry to hear about your father. 

All I can say is read it with him in your heart. It will basically read itself. 

I also wrote mine out a few times to commit some to memory, it was about 6 pages. I also went for a short walk that morning to help ground myself and clear my head. 

Thank you very much for your condolences and encouragement."
astrology,fcx3arn,t3_ej9tzk,1578049355.0,Yeah but I watched my grandmother die recently when I was already in a depression and have been on a steady diet of ativan and junk food and no exercise so I imagine that has everything to do with it.
