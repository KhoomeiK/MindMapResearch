There are also South Asian graves in the cemeteries in France and Belgium. Maybe the stories have not been told to subsequent generations.

I certainly heard from veterans in my family (ww1 and 2) about South Indian and other Empire troops.

Apparently they felt the feet of the soldiers, because the enemy wore very different boots. Just to make sure they got the intended targets (German officers). Bravest soldiers my relative ever saw.

Argos managed to remodel pretty well with the delivery aspect and they seem to be thriving. Catalogue companies are doing well - like Next and the old Grattan now Kaleidescope.
