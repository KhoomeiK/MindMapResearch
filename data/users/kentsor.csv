Ultimately it doesn't matter what an apologist like yourself says, or what a realist like myself says. Neither of us has skin in the game, you just picked BO to cheer for and are just trying to convince yourself. That seems to be going well :-)"

todayilearned,fgfoz0y,t3_ey4cf5,1580744324.0,Being dehydrated after being stuck in snow for four days with a working truck kinda paints him as stupid.
BlueOrigin,fgec2s4,t3_e920tx,1580696147.0,"Thanks for the update. It's very kind of you to provide such concise information in support of the doubters. Perhaps it's just compared to SpaceX that BO seeem at an utter standstill, I'm sure compared to ULA/Boeing BO it is possible to see _something_ happening. Incidentally, does New Shepard even remotely qualify as suborbital? It has zero sideways velocity, and that's kinda where the hard stuff begins, isn't it ?"

They were cutting in two spots at the same time until the inevitable collapse. The recklessness is just staggering. Would it really have cost that much to strap a small shaped charge to each beam...."
videos,fg3dbz5,t3_ewo9p0,1580478531.0,"I'm wondering what they had planned, or expected would happen, cutting through the steel beams around the edge one after another... in the first panning shot, at least 20 beams are already cut along perhaps a fifth of the circumference. It doesn't take much thinking to realize how much imbalance that creates in the structure, so WTF were they thinking..."
worldnews,ff80naa,t1_ff7uadc,1579662911.0,"In fact, I expect to see a sticker on the back of the next Cadillac Escalade I see saying ""I planted a tree. What are YOU doing to save the planet?"" and the driver feeling like Greta Thunberg (whom I admire)"
worldnews,ff7zxcc,t1_ff7uadc,1579662391.0,"Absolutely, we shouldn't bother. It is noise, ineffective, a mere feel good decoy gesture and a distraction, something that takes attention away from meaningful but painful initiatives like phasing out coal rapidly, reducing air travel, reducing consumption. It's not even remotely possible as I pointed out."
worldnews,ff7fhbm,t1_ff6wrga,1579648340.0,"Easy with the gatekeeping there, bud. Trumps support for tree planting is a smokescreen, an excuse for doing _nothing_ that actually makes a difference. It will take decades before the trillion saplings collects a meaningful difference of co2. There are currently three trillion trees on the planet, give or take, so adding a trillion means that the forested area of the planet will have to grow by a third, where is that land going to come from ? If the land where the trees is fallow and unused, odds are there will already be trees growing there, if there isn't well then the land may be to dry and barren to support them anyway. And lets not forget the carbon cost of getting the trees planted...do you think all the participants will walk to where the trees are going to be planted ?"
worldnews,ff6w1yh,t3_erunbv,1579636061.0,"The tree initiative is simple enough for him to understand, and superficially it makes sense. However, at best trees are merely a temporary storage for the co2, the trees die and gets broken down at which point the co2 goes right back into the atmosphere."

AskReddit,fei7oru,t3_ep464s,1579132125.0,"Strictly speaking, it is already replaced. Imperial measurements are defined in terms of metrics units, an inch is simply another way to say 25.4 mm. There is no valid independent definition of imperial units."
canada,fdxm28v,t3_en8yi4,1578770483.0,"Well, at the moment it's plus 10C and very heavy rain, so they may have misjudged. Slight freezing up north, so far the ""catastrophe"" is manageable"
