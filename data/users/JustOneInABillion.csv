depression_help,ffbp664,t3_eshur2,1579776746.0,hi :)
dating_advice,ffboz1q,t3_esgag2,1579776455.0,I dont understand why people think they have any right to badger their view or questions in this  scenario towards any couple whether they are a friend or not to the couple. Your friends arent apart of your romantic relationship with him because you are his gf and his your bf. Sounds to me like they are either jealous or trying to stir something idk. Dont let their perspective fool u because their opinion is basically irrelevent considering they ask those types of questions. You handled that friend and her bf very well so kudos to u.  I guess take this with a grain of salt cause im not in the dating scene :(

Crushes,fctr41m,t3_eipmo8,1577955166.0,"Yes, maybe go up to talk to them, get them into the conversation. Even if it turns out not to be anything romantic, staying friends with someone you like might be the way its meant to be. I have been in this situation but I think its because of my age and the environment maybe idk, or maybe he was in a funk idk"

dating_advice,fc3zz4m,t3_efxri3,1577403016.0,"idk it depends on the guy. Like i look at it more if their height matches their personality, their clothing style ... is that weird?

Also like Im not gonna lie, taller guys seem more attractive to me but then again there has been guys who were shorter than average male height that I also was attracted to. this was more based off their morals and personality so it really depends on the guy"
