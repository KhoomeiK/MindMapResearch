ATV,ffv8q5o,t1_ffuiaol,1580258351.0,"Wyoming is considered ""dry"" but when you get into the high altitude meadows it can literally take _decades_ for the ground or native grasses to recover if someone rips their machine through it. This is a big problem in both Wyoming and Colorado.

Even in the dry areas it only takes one jack wagon out on the trail during a rainstorm to damage an area so bad that you'd need a bulldozer to fix it.

Of course neither of those problems are exclusive to oversized SxS machines, the ATV guys have been just as guilty."
ATV,ffv8j7y,t1_fftrb10,1580258223.0,"Honestly what will probably happen is that the SxS craze will die off. I watched this happen with Sportbikes back in the 2000s. Eventually the market will run out of people with 20K+ of disposable income and it will collapse.

The high zoot machines will still get made and sold there will just be a lot less of them.

If that DOESN'T happen for some reason then the trails will close. There's just no way that the situation will continue as it currently is. There's too many people ripping up the countryside with large powerful machines."

ATV,ffv7gu0,t3_ev2b3p,1580257503.0,"I want to start by saying this: As a moderator of this sub the SxS guys, and gals, are welcome here. They are fun machines and I really don't mean to disrespect you folks that own them.

With that said I feel like I'm missing something. Why MUST Maine move to 65"" and wider trails? Keep it locked at 60"" and let the guys buying these huge ass SxS go find _and fund_ their own places to play.

When half or more of the trail system is on private land you really don't have a lot of room to bitch about what is or isn't available to you.

If Maine simply MUST make the trails wider to accommodate these bloated pieces of off road machinery then start taxing the shit out of them. 

Maine could design a law that is some combination of footprint (wheelbase + width) and factory rated horsepower, when you exceed a predetermined threshold then the registration cost becomes what it would be for an on road vehicle.

Alternatively they could assess an additional $200 in tax on any ORV that is beyond 60"" wide. The folks with normal ATVs and SxS would keep their $45 sticker while the folks with the wide-body SxS would pay $245.

When it comes to power sports you've gotta pay to play and if you want to play hard with a big machine, well, its going to cost more.

These bigger, heavier, faster SxS are great fun to play with but sooner or later they're going to get reigned in. If you own one just get used to the idea.

Edit: Also, the thing with snowmobiles vs ATVs and the funding mix is a bitch. We have the same problem in Wyoming. The ATV registrations are nearly equal to SnowMobiles and yet the snow machine guys get most of the budget. Its just not right."

Bunk.

Also bunk. You ARE the candidates and you need to stop flipping voting for the dinosaurs. As I read around Reddit and watch Millennials debate Biden vs Sanders vs Warren I want to shake you all until your teeth rattle and ask you WTF you're doing! You should be shaking the trees and forcing Yang or Buttgeig to the forefront.

These older candidates are the ones who _created_ these problem. All three are 70 or more and have been holding the levers of power for _decades_. They're literally the ones who voted us into the place we are!

It isn't Capitalism that is failing us and ""breaking"" Young Adulthood it's _unrestrained Capitalism_ that is doing it.

In a nutshell any company that is ""too big to fail"" has become too big too exist and its the job of Government to break it down into pieces small enough that the company's failure is no longer a threat to our economy.

When the Government breaks down monopolies it encourages competition, lowers barriers to entry, stimulates innovation, and increases both employment and employee compensation.

Government has completely failed for decades to referee Capitalism and now we're seeing the social impacts of it.

As for the article's blasting of Medicare and Social Security, well, people paid for those. The money to support it _should_ have been there but its not. I encourage you to go find out why its not there.
