KitchenConfidential,feo8exx,t3_eq18bv,1579296521.0,"I’m from Nor Cal and recently moved to AZ. Apparently I used the word “Bro” too much and now my chef and I say bro so much to each other that the servers started to yell at us when we’re on the line. 

We also scream as loud as we can “I’m on lawn duty” when we’re in the weeds because the new guy screamed it from the walkin when asked to cut filets."

weddingplanning,fcwiowb,t3_ej730p,1578026670.0,If you’re doing an at home or family members house wedding remember extra toilet paper and extra if not disposable hand towels.
Games,eyv5n8m,t3_cypgkx,1567481402.0,I really liked the Brothers in Arms series. They were all 3 super rough around the edges but I think the series could be revived with success with a talented team. I do think none are better than the Furious 7 nonsense that was in the works for awhile though.
