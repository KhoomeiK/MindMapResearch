Quantum immortality is based on the ""many worlds"" theory which requires that the universe splits into an unimaginable number of timelines at every moment.  Every possible quantum interaction is happening in every possible configuration, and for each difference in those interactions another timeline must be created.

Effectively, there are trillions of trillions of trillions of timelines where you exist, and each of those timelines is creating trillions more timelines where you exist at every second.  There will always be timelines where you inexplicably continue to survive, and those timelines will propagate more.  Truly, I can't think of a way that it would ever end.  No matter how hopeless the situation, something could always happen to keep you going.  Hell, you could be in the void of space with no space suit and an entire habitable planet could materialize around you.  Is it likely?  No.  But, with the right combination of particles popping into existence at the right time, there is technically a chance...so, there will be some timeline where that happens.  Not just some timeline, but a huge number of them, even if it is still an infinitesimally small percentage of the total number of timelines.

The theory is really crazy.  It predicts that there are timelines where every time anyone in the world rolls a pair of dice, it lands on 6 and it has always landed on a 6 for every dice roll in all of history.  There is no actual physical reason for this, as each time someone rolls the dice, there is no real weighting toward that.  In fact, each roll would split off into 11x as many (or around that) timelines where it didn't land on 6 for the first time in history.  But there will always be a ~1/12 of the timelines where the streak of 6s continue."

aww,fd30tpg,t1_fd0unb1,1578153695.0,I'm not really sure what your comment means.
aww,fd0kavw,t1_fd07ybg,1578120036.0,"Honestly, that is a reasonable reaction.  Cows generally weigh 1000+ pounds.  They are giant creatures and could easily trample a grown man, let alone a 7 year old child.

I remember being young and feeding our sheep.  Even that was terrifying, and they are much smaller."

Fruit in general tends to be full of sugar.  And, root vegetables, like was mentioned in this article, are packed full of more complex carbs.

Eating foods late that aren't full of carbs is the key.  It doesn't matter if it is broccoli or steak."

I can't say it was my last one, because I randomly smoked a drunk cigarette a couple of times after that, but in both cases it was disgusting enough to dissuade me from even considering going back to it.  I think the actual last one was in early 2017.

Stick to it.  You will be happy you did."
Cringetopia,fctgckd,t1_fcso6yz,1577942378.0,"Those ponies are representing little girls.  They are just young female cartoon animals standing in the place of young female cartoon humans.  That is the entire fucking point.  That is why most people see bronies as disgusting.  It is sad that so many of you simply don't understand this is what is happening, or see what you are doing."
politics,fcsubwy,t1_fcrp9xa,1577925309.0,"The Republican party is the party of big business.  It always has been.  Even before the ""switch"" the parties did in the middle of the 20th century.  Everything they ""stand for"" is based on this.  That is why it is so hard to nail them down on so many issues.  They just take a position of opposition to Democrats in most cases because they really just don't give a shit, but taking a position plays well to a large portion of their base that wants to be told what to think."

My son is in 5th grade and they are already diving into slavery and the Civil War.  They also have read two books related to the Holocaust, but that wasn't in history class."
oddlysatisfying,fcc9ipw,t1_fcbu8r7,1577595884.0,Raw chicken has this weird consistency that is both crunchy and slimy at the same time.  It is not at all the same as something like raw steak or raw fish.
