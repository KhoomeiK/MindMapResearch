Wake,ff8hk18,t1_ff7lwdk,1579678793.0,Yes. I almost landed it twice. The third time I tried to grab and it made me rotate faster and I landed on the tail. On this weekend I'll try again and pop even more!
rust,ff5ubg7,t3_ereh5h,1579610511.0,"Thanks to /u/geaal for all his hardwork on [nom](https://crates.io/crates.io/nom) and for still sustaining all the private jokes about nom being twice as slow as pest — it’s not true, but it’s funny!

Thanks to Brendan Zabarauskas for some crates I use on a daily basis, among [gl](https://crates.io/crates/gl) and [cgmath](https://crates.io/crates/cgmath).

Thanks to [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) authors. This is one of the best crate out there, both in terms of speed and elegancy.

Finally, thanks to everybody who contributed and still contribute to the crates I maintain — mostly `luminance` and all its associated crates, `glsl`, `splines`, `warmy`, `cargo-sync-readme`, `bidule` and others. I can’t name everybody, but several people made very good contributions (especially feature requests), on GitHub, IRC, Discord or around a beer in Paris, and accept constructive criticism to bring APIs and designs to the right direction.

We have the chance to have such an epic community. We shall keep going! Keep the vibes! :)"

Wake,fe9w89t,t1_fe8oacl,1578941986.0,"Yes. The coach told me that the day before yesterday too. I pull on the handle which generates a rotation around the vertical axis. Also, I don’t bend the head behind enough, which doesn’t allow to flip.

Thanks for all the advices. I’ll try all that on Saturday and Sunday!"
Wake,fe9vton,t1_fe9gj6o,1578941863.0,"On the 2.0 I go every weekend this winter, I asked the coaches to keep practicing the basics (ollie, ollie 180, 3.6 surface, position while riding and edging, position when jumping straight air, air 180, TS straight air, TS air 180, SW straight air, SW air 180 and TS SW air 180). Then I try new tricks. But I try to focus on the _basics_ most of the time to ensure I have solid foundations.

I guess the problem was pointed at by others in this thread: I’m now too focused on trying to do something and not having fun. I’ll try the 3-try idea: try three times a trick, and if it doesn’t work out, move to something else.

Also, I have a current plan. Looking at the videos, I think my main problem with my current approach to Tantrum is my head. I don’t throw it behind me, looking at the sky, as I should do. I’ll then:

1. Practice some jumps off kickers, straight air, by looking at the shore and being completely aligned with the cable. I came to the realization that every time I jump for a Tantrum, I’m not correctly aligned and panic to quickly look at the shore (I guess the extra rotation comes from there).
2. Once I have 1. okay, I’ll try to pop the fuck up as much as possible and throw the head behind without trying a Tantrum. An operator told me that Tantrums are traditionally done behind a boat, arms outstretched and same for legs. People bend the knees to accelerate the rotation but it should be doable without doing so. So I guess that step should be help to fix my head position.
3. Once all that is okay, I’ll try to go more for a “backflip” movement.
4. (extra) I’ll try to backflip from the dock.

Then if I fail all that three times in a row, I’ll switch to blinds, 180 BS off kicker and 3.60 FS off kicker. And backroll!"
Wake,fe4rtk0,t1_fe4iciz,1578862209.0,I take the advice. Thanks!
Wake,fe3wvli,t1_fe3ijz6,1578853561.0,"I’ve also noticed pretty much no one does tantrums on the lakes I go (I visit usually 5 / 6 lakes, at least this year). I talked about that to an operator, and he said “Well, people don’t do Tantrums because they’re too easy, so it would be a shame.”

It left me uncertain."

dating,fe399f0,t3_eniipr,1578847167.0,"Years ago, I broke up with someone I loved deeply. I was in love but I also admired her. It was a toxic relationship (not because of her, nor myself, but because of the fact she wasn’t in love with me even though respected me, and because I was deeply, DEEPLY in love and my thoughts — and at some time even interests — would be completely centered around her; we both suffered, at different extent, but nevertheless, it was toxic). It took me months to accept the break up and that I was emotionally dependent. I had several exes after her but every time I was single again, I kept remembering her and what she represented.

One year ago or so, I realized I had to email her again, but not to meet or to try to get back into the relationship. I just wanted to tell her more about the _aftermath_. While writing it, I realized how dumb I was becoming. We stayed six months together and I admired her for things she was doing, but I completely ignored all the things I — today at least — would consider red-flags. Among those, the fact she has that will that is not uncommon at all to _go to the gym and get strong_. I guess it’s a bit less common for women but men or women, I think getting strong for getting strong shouldn’t lead to admiration — quite the opposite, actually; I don’t find anything pure nor interesting into growing up one’s muscle mass. I’m sportsy and athletic, but I do it for the sports, the raw performance and I give no shit about whether I have ripped abs or visible veins etc. (if you’re curious, I have very large shoulders and _long_ muscles — I’ve been a race swimmer, you can see the type of bodies they have). Anyway, I realized that I admired her for _the wrong reasons_, some of them not even being real (I just fantasized some traits she didn’t even had). The fact she was into science was a very important point to me… but I realized I shouldn’t admire her for that. Because today, I know a LOT of girls and women into even more scientific and niche things (and I truly admire some for the work they’re doing, especially into the IT world). It puts some relief and helps with hindsight.

All this to say: after her, I started to enjoy myself. Really. I don’t mean going for one-night stand sex. I don’t do that — I tried it, several times, I really hate it. I’m a very sensitive guy and I need emotions, feelings and connection. Sex without those is not for me. I went into wakeboarding and it helped me a lot to just _stop giving fucks about being into a relationship_ and just enjoy myself. There’s a song from Gojira in which they sing the following, powerful line that means everything to me:

> [Remain in what you are, the center of your life […]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkg7mM5z_xc&t=4m4s)

You are the only and one most important person in your life. Learn how to love yourself. This is not being selfish. It’s being together. The trick here is not to go to the other side: don’t shut on yourself. Stay open. Get what life gives you and don’t expect anything to happen. Be yourself.

To answer your question, I had it, I have it, and I have learned to live with it. I might never find back someone I admire like I admired her, but I accepted that. Maybe I will and it would be, honestly, super cool. Sharing all the crazy stuff I do with someone doing her crazy stuff too. It would be super amazing. But… I don’t know the odds for that to happen. So better live our lives happy and don’t expect too much of it. Right? :)

dating,fdy3a8m,t3_enbxa5,1578775601.0,"> However I began noticing that she really didn’t give a shit about what was going on in my life […]

I knew that. It’s even worse if you’re a good listener (I am). And as soon as you try speaking about something happening to you (good, bad, whatever), she would just say “hm hm” and will switch to her topics. I knew that and it sucks. It should be the first and last red-flag (that’s kind of toxic).

> At this point I haven’t seen her in almost a month […]

I knew that too. And it’s horrible. I made a mistake I hope you won’t make: when that happens, if you’re not okay with it, break up. Maybe people do that because they’re through hard times, they have life issues, etc. or because they’re just selfish as fuck. Both cases suck. One must give up after that.

> I didn’t want to text her at all because I knew she was on vacation in Israel with her family. […]

So, about that argument. It’s funny because I do the same (when someone doesn’t text often, I don’t push pressure and wait). But… when I see someone else doing it, I find it weird and dumb. How does being with your family prevent you to text someone once or twice in the day? Or every two days. Whatever. If you care about building something with someone else… you keep the discussion running.

> I never in my entire life flipped out on a girl before and I’m pretty usually chill about […]

Yep, I knew that too. I’ve never flipped out on anyone but when you become suspicious, when _something feels_ wrong, you might do things you wouldn’t think you do (I did the stalking stuff with a smartphone, immediately felt bad about it and ashamed, and it’s something I had NEVER done before and have NEVER done after either). I guess that, that mixed feelings of sorrow, angriness, suspicion etc. sometimes trigger something. It’s okay. It happens. We’re still only human.

> But the fact that she ditched me for another guy and then think she can come back and then leave again really hurt me […]

It really is disrespectful… :(

Soo… you’re not with her anymore. Good. Now you’ve acquired something positive after all this: experience. About yourself. And what you should be careful about. :)"
