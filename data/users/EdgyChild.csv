depression,fe2v5j1,t3_engd6e,1578843212.0,"Joker and Taxin Driver were some of the movies I related to most to the point where, while watching them they gave me a sort feeling of familiarity and comfort. For me it's always interesting to see the sort of situations the protagonists are in, which path they chose and where it leads them since there is no progression in my life. I've been depressed for years and nothing comes out of it. No killing spree which ends with some dead pimps and certainly no uprising of the working class."

I'd rather blow my brains out or overdose, seems more peaceful and some poor fella wouldn't have to scrape me off the sidewalk. I know life can be rough especially when you don't have anyone that cares about you / gives you attention but if I was you I'd wait between 1-12 months and write down all the things that make me happy and all the bad thoughts. Then you can weigh it out and decide your fate. I don't wanna sound like a jackass and tell you what to do but either that or could always jump off a bridge I guess."
depression,fdld4z8,t3_elza8u,1578521475.0,I don't like the Reddit community that much either but I don't talk much at school.
