Coronavirus,fgfphv2,t3_exv5a4,1580744667.0,"the worse news is that very reputable Indian scientists found that the nCoV virus has a part of the HIV virus. I'm convinced this is an escaped BIO weapon.  [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1) 

Of course, the paper that was published was taken down within hours probably because of death threats. The nCoV is being treated in china with HIV meds.

It would most likely end up being a military coup, but everyone I know and served with in the military support trump and see through the pathetic liberal media’s attempt to overthrow him even though he was elected with 99% of every media outlet constantly shitting on him on a personal level. It’s pathetic and you’ll see exactly what I’m talking about come November, no candidate will come close to touching the numbers he’s going to bring in, especially not socialist sanders. 

Non Americans that don’t live here have to rely on the worthless media to get your information and let me tell you, all of what they say is complete bullshit just to help the dems get office, which won’t happen for a very long time based on how they’re acting like little babies screaming and crying about everything, everything’s a “bombshell” or a march or a protest it’s kind of pathetic and hilarious at the same time."

Trust me. Your motivation to do things will come back. Take it from me I’m 28 smoked in high school felt the same exact way, i quit and it was like night and day, just smoke again when you’re on your own and mature enough to handle it.
I know people say weed is harmless blah blah blah, my name is high_mike I love weed like it’s my own mother but I’m not gonna pretend there isn’t negative affects to it. Especially to youngins like yourself. 
Plus school is fucking gay and boring. Once you go to college you’ll see the world differently, just put your head down and finish high school and don’t drop out. Goodluck"
