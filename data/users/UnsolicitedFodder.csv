I want every Dem candidate to publicly state that the camps will be shut down on day one of their presidency. They need to have a plan ready to go to safely release every one of these poor people on day one. With laws proposed by Congress to make sure this NEVER happens again."

politics,ff9lqdh,t1_ff9k1ln,1579715647.0,"I will say one good thing about Trump. I never paid attention to people like Mitch McConnell before Trump was elected. His election opened my eyes to the insidiousness of people like Moscow Mitch. I think in hindsight, Trump’s election will be the thing that woke a lot of people up to the shady shit going on in our government. It’s always been there, but most of us weren’t paying attention before Trump because we thought it was all being handled."

mildlyinteresting,ff4xra4,t1_ff3x04p,1579574990.0,My parents’ dryer caught on fire years ago and my mom religiously cleans the lint trap. Luckily the fire dept got there fast because their basement is unfinished and the fire started going up the insulation on the walls. The fire dept told them they should be taking the back off at least once a year to vacuum the lint out. I didn’t know you ever needed to do that.

Literally everything was included, the only decorating we had to do was centerpieces. The ceremony was done right there, the bridal party went outside and got pictures done, then right inside to the reception. The food was excellent, but again, that’s over a decade ago. 

Their pictures ended up really nice with the water in the background and I’m sure you could get great shots if you do cocktail hour on the boat!"

Also, my brother got married at the Lockport Locks (about 11 years ago) it was great and very reasonably priced, pictures came out lovely. We didn’t do the cocktail hour on the boat but that sounds very cool!"

awakened,ff48qnt,t1_ff44l2p,1579557997.0,"Funny, I experienced my first full-on panic attack in October. I had already been on the path but that blew the doors off for me, so to speak. I wish I had been able to see past the panic because that disassociation/depersonalization made me feel like I was so close. If I could have just rode the panic wave instead of drowning in it... the self control is so strong for me. It will relax when it’s ready to though, I suppose!"
awakened,ff42muo,t1_ff405yb,1579554198.0,"Thank you for your guidance! Just knowing that another person understands is so helpful. This post of yours today triggered something in me and got me thinking more of the physicality of it all. 

What you said about “is holding onto the rock making anything better?” and I think for me, it’s this blockage where I feel that the known is better than any unknown, even if the known isn’t even that great. I want to believe that the fear of the unknown is false so badly but I just can’t accept it yet. I suppose I do know it will come in time and cannot be rushed or forced. 

I sometimes do progressive muscle relaxation, and I will put more awareness into it after reading your words. I will try to be aware if I am still holding onto anything. 

Your point about the mind having no say in it really resonates with me. I suppose my mind is deluding me into thinking it has all of the power because it is afraid of what will happen if I fully realize that it has no power here. 

Again, thank you for your response and for this post. I feel so much elation at having connected with you on this. I look forward to seeing more posts from you!"
awakened,ff3y0i2,t1_ff3xu1y,1579551323.0,"Thanks! Currently trying the devotional Bhakti, I have a tendency to get really caught up in the mind and block off the heart so the more I can explore the Heart path, the better!"
awakened,ff3x6hx,t1_ff3m9vq,1579550804.0,"For me, intellectually I “know” that I am holding onto that rock but I suppose I don’t understand how to let go of it. I think I feel a fear of letting go of that control but I still don’t understand why. Maybe you can recommend a practice that would help me understand how to let go? I am currently in the process of holding these questions in my mind and trying to answer them with my heart, being tender with myself. Luckily I have a good guide that is helping me, but I seem to be a little stuck in letting go. The struggle for me is understanding intellectually what I need to do but not truly feeling it. I know there is nothing to fear but the question is do I really believe that in my deepest heart?"
awakened,ff3w266,t1_ff3if5a,1579550103.0,"This is very interesting to me. I’m at that point where when I close my eyes, I still “see” the outline of my body and I’ve become really aware of that lately. I also attributed this more to aphantasia than to being however far into the awakening stages. In your opinion, what was it that shifted you into the next stage? I’m trying to remain open and “try without trying” but I desire (too much) to get to the next stage. I know it will come/is already there, but I suppose I am impatient :)"

unpopularopinion,feiafbu,t1_fehmhr3,1579133906.0,"Your whole post was so mean-spirited and unnecessary. You had to link directly to this guy’s post? There’s no possible way you didn’t know this post would turn into an attack on someone who is currently grieving. This whole post has the tone of “no offense, but...”. You don’t know their life, what gives you the right to judge? Even if you disagree with his perceived motives and wanted to post about it, you could have been a lot more general than linking the damn post and I’m sure everyone would have known what you were talking about. This is just so heartless and unnecessary. You’re not helping anyone here, all you did was give people an excuse to shit on someone who is going through something awful. I’m sure you feel good about yourself though, so who cares?"
