suggestmeabook,fdm15uk,t3_em2eqm,1578537347.0,"Sorry I have no concept of age appropriateness since I read everything from YA to Stephen King. I just picked a few with minimal or no swears, no terribly graphic violence, and no overt sex. 

Fortunately the Milk by Neil Gaiman (safe, is actually a kids book)

The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman. Has a very menacing antagonist and is set in a graveyard so death is a topic.

Coraline by Neil Gaiman. Is a good, short read. Adults seem to find it much creepier than kids do.

Ooh! Read Gregor the Overlander series by Suzanne Collins. Warning, some very sad moments as favorite characters die, but very appropriate for younger audiences.

Edit: sorry, I just read “for me and my 9 year old” and got sorta carried away. Not humor books per se but have their funny moments and I still think you’d like them."

suggestmeabook,fdimq9r,t1_fdim21k,1578446360.0,"House of Leaves has a reputation as sort of an artifact book. The way the page is laid out is part of the story. I’m not sure it would translate to ebook format. That said, since it comes so well recommended despite not being popular in ebook or audiobook format, I’d say that means it’s probably pretty good, or at least enough of an experience that folks find it memorable. I may give it a read this year."

suggestmeabook,fdhcb4a,t3_ela2bf,1578419826.0,Won’t help. Self help only works when you recognize a problem and seek it out for yourself. Taming Your Gremlin by Rick Carson is a good book tho. lots if negativity comes from negative self talk. If someone complains a lot chances are they’re not very happy with themselves either.

rpg,fde7t24,t1_fddhqyf,1578333062.0,"Just to pile on, hp wasn’t ALWAYS this abstract notion of stress like it’s portrayed in modern editions. Back in the day, you lost hp *when you got hit* (and when you were at 0 you were dead). the fact that i lose hp when an attack lands means to me i’ve taken damage and not just that my luck’s running out or i’m getting tired. hp in modern dnd is a bad abstraction."

You should get better at avoiding sword blows. BRP/RQ model combat in a way that to me is more satisfying than DND e.g. Armor absorbs damage but doesn’t make you harder to hit and your max hp is pretty much set for the life of the character."

bulletjournal,fdci9c7,t1_fdc57br,1578275568.0,All good suggestions on what to do with unused journals. They’re mostly completely unused. And yes I’ve already resolved to go back to basics. One thing I realized is that doing spreads too far in advance really takes the steam out of my journaling.
bulletjournal,fdci1p4,t1_fdcawak,1578275416.0,"Yep. Same. As mentioned, not feeling well and learning painful lessons about creative projects on low energy. Main thing was I wanted a big change to my journal to reflect the change in decade. I think using a binder is gonna be a big enough change and allow me to work out some creative frustration. Thanks for your input."
suggestmeabook,fdchfje,t1_fdcguta,1578274973.0,"The question is like that series in what way? I also recommend the On A Pale Horse series from the same author and Callahans Crosstime Saloon is also punny but not very similar in story. You would probably also like the Discworld series for comic fantasy adventure. Since you like point n click adventures, be aware that Discworld has a notoriously difficult adventure game and Callahans has a gorgeous game that was my intro to the series. Both games should appeal to KQ fans."
suggestmeabook,fdcavwj,t3_ekldmk,1578270600.0,You stumped me. What is it about KQ you liked? The fractured fairy tales? The puzzles? The only thing I can think of right now is for some reason the Xanth novels since they’re about as punny as KQ and feature quests of various kinds.
