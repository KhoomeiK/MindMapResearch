bridezillas,fffs2wm,t3_et7q7t,1579890575.0,"The only thing that would make her sister shitty, is if her family actually voiced their concerns and she still insisted everyone go and shoulder all these costs. 

But it doesn't sound like anyone's been honest about how they feel, and I don't know the bride, so I can't say how she'd really react, but its still HER wedding, and her wedding shouldn't cater to anyone else, so long as she doesn't expect anyone to go out of their way to be there for her.

As someone who had a destination wedding in Mexico, my sister, (ex) step dad /more like real dad, and even a lot of my very closest friends didn't come. My mother and my brother weren't supposed to come either but managed to pull it together at the very last second and surprised me at the resort. I wasn't mad at any of them, but them not coming wasn't going to change what my husband and I had planned for our day. I planned a destination wedding, knowing that it wouldn't be what worked for everyone. 

If OPs sister still insists this is the wedding she wants after someone finally does talk to her, and the family realistically doesn't see themselves going, I'd suggest having an informal ceremony either before / after their wedding, as often times signing legal paperwork in another country is a LOT of effort, and most often easier to just do at home anyways. This was what my husband and I did when we got home from Mexico, we signed our marriage license with an adjudicator in my sister's backyard with my step dad and a few friends, it was still incredibly special, and was a way to include everyone we loved that didn't make it to Mexico."

I don't think I commented on the original post, because you were already getting tons of helpful advice, but I'm really happy your kids are able to relax a bit, get some rest and enjoy being at home!

Who's to say he wasn't actually a great shot, not like you'd seen him shooting before, and he hadn't seen you, so he just assumed that you were just some dumb inexperienced girl. 

Buddy, NTA. Good job for proving his backwards way of thinking wrong."

WhitePeopleTwitter,ff6qnwh,t1_ff6q366,1579632861.0,"I dont even know how to respond to this. This was my entire point, that we've capitalized on an industry because we have all these great things. That I'm proud of my province for providing jobs in an industry that excites people and allows its locals to feel pride in it being showcased. I in no way assumed filming started here because we ""built mountains"" for it. I'm proud of BC for a lot of things... This specific thread was talking about movies and filming locations. You made the statement that the only reason people filmed here was because it was cheaper.. ya ok it's cheaper, but that's not the only reason bud. It's beautiful, and industrial, and we've built up our film industry to take advantage of these things and be more openly available to film in. Jenkies."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff6p3th,t1_ff6os5q,1579631933.0,"Yes that's true, and maybe this is just me being prideful of the province I grew up in, but we also have great film schools, lots of local professionals, and easily accessible film locations of lots of different sceneries within a short traveling distance. I'm not denying it's financially better sense to film here, but its really not the only reason."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff6nuy3,t1_ff6nnoc,1579631182.0,"They may not be Canadian based films. But Canada (mostly BC) has movie making in the bag. Not hard when your scenery is as fantastic as it here. Just think it's funny that Americans have such a monopoly on movies and tv shows. All of supernatural is filmed here too, I could sit here and list hundreds of shows."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff6nc6l,t1_ff5sv2i,1579630865.0,"I'll never get over the hundreds of times you see foggy eerie woods and mountains and oceans, and it's just squamish. There's a Daniel Radcliffe movie where he's got horns (I think it's called horns?) And the whole thing is shot in squamish, hell they even have a front door shot of the chieftain bar / motel. 

America, you don't realize this but most of your movies are filmed in Canada."

Also this is NOT my post, this is a story that someone on Reddit shared a few months back in the comments section of a story sort of like yours. It resonated heavily with me, and it might you as well.

THE BRIDGE - A METAPHOR
""The Bridge""
There was a man who had given much thought to what he wanted from life. He had experienced many moods and trials. He had experimented with different ways of living, and he had had his share of both success and failure. At last, he began to see clearly where he wanted to go.

Diligently, he searched for the right opportunity. Sometimes he came close, only to be pushed away. Often he applied all his strength and imagination, only to find the path hopelessly blocked. And then at last it came. But the opportunity would not wait. It would be made available only for a short time. If it were seen that he was not committed, the opportunity would not come again.

Eager to arrive, he started on his journey. With each step, he wanted to move faster; with each thought about his goal, his heart beat quicker; with each vision of what lay ahead, he found
renewed vigor. Strength that had left him since his early youth returned, and desires, all kinds of desires, reawakened from their long-dormant positions.

Hurrying along, he came upon a bridge that crossed through the middle of a town. It had been built high above a river in order to protect it from the floods of spring. He started across. Then he noticed someone coming from the opposite direction. As they moved closer, it seemed as though the other was coming to greet him. He could see clearly, however, that he did not know this other, who was dressed similarly except for something tied around his waist. When they were within hailing distance, he could see that what
the other had about his waist was a rope. It was wrapped around him many times and probably, if extended, would reach a length of 30 feet.

The other began to uncurl the rope, and, just as they were coming close, the stranger said, ""Pardon me, would you be so kind as to hold the end a moment?"" Surprised by this politely phrased but curious request, he agreed without a thought, reached out, and took it. ""Thank you,"" said the other, who then added, ""two hands now, and remember, hold tight."" Whereupon, the other jumped off the bridge.

Quickly, the free-falling body hurtled the distance of the ropes length, and from the bridge the man abruptly felt the pull. Instinctively, he held tight and was almost dragged over the side. He managed to brace himself against the edge, however, and after having caught his breath, looked down at the other dangling, close to oblivion.

""What are you trying to do?"" he yelled.

""Just hold tight,"" said the other.

""This is ridiculous,"" the man thought and began trying to haul the other in. He could not get the leverage, however. It was as though the weight of the other person and the length of the rope
had been carefully calculated in advance so that together they created a counterweight just beyond his strength to bring the other back to safety.

""Why did you do this?"" the man called out.

""Remember,"" said the other, ""if you let go, I will be lost.""

""But I cannot pull you up,"" the man cried.

""I am your responsibility,"" said the other.

""Well, I did not ask for it,"" the man said.

""If you let go, I am lost,"" repeated the other.
He began to look around for help. But there was no one. How long would he have to wait? Why did this happen to befall him now, just as he was on the verge of true success? He examined
the side, searching for a place to tie the rope. Some protrusion, perhaps, or maybe a hole in the boards. But the railing was unusually uniform in shape; there were no spaces between the boards. There was no way to get rid of this newfound
burden, even temporarily.

""What do you want?"" he asked the other hanging below. 

""Just your help,"" the other answered. 

""How can I help? I cannot pull you in, and there is no place to tie the rope so that I can go and find someone to help me help you.""

""I know that. Just hang on; that will be enough. Tie the rope around your waist; it will be easier.""

Fearing that his arms could not hold out much longer, he tied the rope around his waist.

""Why did you do this?"" he asked again. ""Don't you see what you have done? What possible purpose could you have had in mind?""

""Just remember,"" said the other, ""my life is in your hands.""

What should he do? ""If I let go, all my life I will know that I let this other die. If I stay, I risk losing my momentum toward my own long-sought-after salvation. Either way this will haunt me forever.""

With ironic humor he thought to die himself, instantly, to jump off the bridge while still holding on. ""That would teach this fool."" But he wanted to live and to live life fully. ""What a choice I have to make; how shall I ever decide?""

As time went by, still no one came. The critical moment of decision was drawing near. To show his commitment to his own goals, he would have to continue on his journey now. It was already almost too late to arrive in time. But what a terrible choice to have to make.

A new thought occurred to him. While he could not pull this other up solely by his own efforts, if the other would shorten the rope from his end by curling it around his waist again and again, together they could do it. Actually, the other could do it by himself, so long as he, standing on the bridge, kept it still and steady.

""Now listen,"" he shouted down. ""I think I know how to save you."" And he explained his plan. But the other wasn't interested.

""You mean you won't help? But I told you I cannot pull you up by myself, and I don't think I can hang on much longer either.""

""You must try,"" the other shouted back in tears. ""If you fail, I die.""

The point of decision arrived. What should he do? ""My life or this other's?"" And then a new idea. A revelation. So new, in fact, it seemed heretical, so alien was it to his traditional way of thinking. ""I want you to listen to me carefully,"" he said, ""because I mean what I am about to say. I will not accept the position of choice for your life, only for my own; the position of choice for your own life I hereby give back to you.""

""What do you mean?"" the other asked, afraid.

""I mean, simply, it's up to you. You decide which way this ends. I will become the counterweight. You do the pulling and bring yourself up. I will even tug a little from here."" He began unwinding the rope from around his waist and braced himself anew against the side.

""You cannot mean what you say,"" the other shrieked. ""You would not be so selfish. I am your responsibility. What could be so important that you would let someone die? Do not do this to me.""

He waited a moment. There was no change in the tension of the rope. ""I accept your choice,"" he said, at last, and freed his hands.
