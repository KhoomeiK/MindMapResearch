WTF,fdqcepy,t1_fdpk6ge,1578662879.0,Read the whole fucking thing then you will understand moron; to clarify this is at /u/jemmeryK people shit on diesel all the time but the fact of the matter is getting higher fuel mileage is easier to attain with existing diesels compared to gas. There was on user that posted in /r/diesel that’s from Europe with a 3 cylinder vw that gets 63 (!!!) mpg with some mild tuning(!) others have hyper miled the damn thing and got just above 100(!). There’s also another guy with an 07 lbz duramax (granted he dumped insane money) getting near 30 mpg while putting down over 1000 hp and double torque and didn’t do any weight reduction and I’m sure he could probably get 32ish mpg and while being a 9000 pound vehicle.

What does happen is you get roughly an extra 10mpg easy, least mine did."
