Also, the use of recurrent themes makes it easy to slot themes and ideas from other franchises into the world in a way that still feels natural. For instance, Zuko gets dropped into Westeros and suddenly the whole ""Prince that was promised""/""Lord of Light"" thing, along with the worship of fire and all the related doodads, becomes a lot more literal than anyone in the world would have expected. Drop him into some port town in the Reach or the Westerlands, have him get into a fight where he accidentally burns down half the town (because he's a firebender in a medieval town where everything's built out of extremely flammable materials, extremely close together) ... and he's reborn amidst salt and smoke."

I do notice that a lot of fanfic tends to focus on pairing and romance, although I'm not a fan of romance generally so this isn't the case with a lot of the things I read - maybe that's a bit of a chicken-and-egg argument. For the most part, I read fanfiction because I want to carry on reading stories with the characters and set in the worlds I've grown to love. I love the themes that crop up in fanfiction that either don't crop up as much in non-fanfic, or don't crop up at all - things like the clash of two completely separate cultures you see in crossovers, where it's not just someting like ""guy from the real world goes to a fantasy world""

Actually, I can't really offer very much on this topic, I've not really been very reflective about it or given it much thought. I've always been aware that fanfiction's more popular with women, but it's something I've always just accepted."
