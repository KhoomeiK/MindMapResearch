NoStupidQuestions,fgl5ku8,t3_ez1qnh,1580882766.0,"This happened to me before for like a week too. What I did was, I forced my self to eat during weekdays because I was also working at that time. But by the time the weekend arrived, I starved my self to death by cycling outside, treated my self with something hard and challenging. It refreshed my spirits then I felt again that hunger, that need, that craving. My favorite burger stand helped me go back to my normal mind. By the time I got back home that night, I was again ready to consume every food served in front of me.
