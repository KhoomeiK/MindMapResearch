Although I'd rather silencer not be advertised to be played as anything. Because in dumbster tier (including up to 3k) every single person that picks silencer wants to be the guy in this pic.

I mean, if you play core a lot you should just know matchups and what kind of items you need to get. Two of the best heroes for this are Jugg and, to a lesser extent, Lifestealer. Each hero can build basically any core damage items and make them work, and knowing when and where to get which ones makes all the difference. Really all it is is asking yourself two questions: what has to happen for me to die this game, and how do I kill enemy heroes this game.

The more you play core the easier it becomes to answer these questions. And mindlessly afk hitting creeps is the perfect time to think about what you need to spend your money on to make sure you don't die and enemy heroes do."
DotA2,fewnnch,t1_fewk23g,1579415957.0,"And worrying about every second that goes by is the mentality of high MMR players that have perfected every single step of their play up until the point where standing one pixel to the left is going to mean I get 1.65gpm more. That and low MMR players that blame their teammates for everything, even though there are things they could have done better for the team that would have helped the game as a whole.

Macro-level play is FAR more important, especially the lower you go. That's not saying not being able to get last hits is acceptable, that's saying knowing when and where to play is more important than how you're playing.

Besides, how important is your individual skill level when it comes to a team game? What matters is how you operate inside of your team. Otherwise the best games of DOTA ever played would be the All-Star matches at TI, right? I mean, they are regarded as literally some of the best players for their role, right? So if you get the 5 best players and put them on a team that makes them unstoppable, right?

Fuck no. The best teams are the ones that make it to the finals. The people that have perfected their play down to the point where it really is the seconds that matter. Like Ana figuring out while in the middle of getting killed that if he sold an item he'd have buyback to help defend the push. The teams that play the finals may have 8+ players that weren't in the All-Star match, that aren't the 'best' at their roles, but they are groups of players that understand how to play this TEAM game.

How to play as a team and with the other four people you're queued with is FAR MORE IMPORTANT than you maximizing your CS. That attitude screams 'I'm stuck in the trench because my teammates aren't as good as me, that's why I lose.' But hey, if you're so good that you're at the point where the only thing that matters is how you spend your seconds as a carry, shit man, you must be doing pretty well. Can't wait to see you at TI."
DotA2,fewjr3t,t1_fewjev3,1579412059.0,"It's not about taking over the supports role, it's about having a couple sentries in case you're farming and realize you're on top of a ward. You're not supposed to run across the map to deward instead of a support.

Also your kind of efficiency is only useful once you're in the top <1% of players. But for everyone else what you're doing with your minutes is more important than what you're doing with your seconds. Like understanding instead of being on this side of the map hitting creeps I should be on the other side because the team is planning on taking the objectives on that side.

I'm glad you're just so good you don't even have to think about these things anymore, but maybe let's try spreading the message and teaching 'bad' players that being a good team player is better than hitting creep real good."
DotA2,fewin7t,t1_fewhayb,1579411305.0,"> so the reason your carries don't want to play treasure hunt is probably that standing there switching items from backpack

Well excuse us, can't wait to see you at TI on the main stage. 

What does it matter if it's efficient? This isn't a pro match. Every second you don't spend hitting a creep doesn't mean you're falling behind. If you know where the vision is, go fucking kill a jungle camp while you swap in a sentry, come back, kill the vision, and move on. 

Yeah, cool, it's the supports 'job' to buy all the wards, I get it, but that doesn't mean you can't help out. Especially when you have an ability that pretty much tells you exactly where an enemy ward is.

Are you the same kind of guy that would play Zeus but never use your W to get vision to kill a ward? Even if your support was standing right there and could kill it but didn't have detection but you KNOW THERE IS A WARD THERE.

I love the attitude of how important it is for cores to be hitting creeps more than playing as a team member. It's what makes DOTA great."

So damage from scorched earth, whichs doubles at lvl2 and gets a 50% increase on top of that at 3, is hitting two enemy heroes and not just one.

You get a value point in Q to get good regen and a useful creep ability for your lane (I'm looking at you dispel satyr), you get a value point in your E to have a stun, and then everything else is W so that you're damaging two enemy heroes just by standing near them.

It's the same reason CM's Q nuke is better than the W stun during the laning phase, when you're constantly able to hit two heroes with it. Yes, for a single target it does less damage, but you're able to hit two targets when there are always two heroes in lane standing near eachother."

I've been working in kitchens for about 4 years now and am currently in one that is literally 99% mexican and 1% me, and every single mexican male I have worked with is like this. No reason to want/need higher education if this barely above minimum wage job can pay the bills this month as long as you work 60 hours a week. But then there's nothing going to, like, savings, so that one day you don't have to work 60 hours a week because you have savings to sit back on.

It's really confusing to me, as I was raised with a ""get a degree, get a job, have a future"" kind of mentality. But now I'm surrounded by people that are going to work low-level jobs until the day they can't get out of bed and to work. And when that day comes they won't have a penny waiting for them.

Or maybe I'm just racist. That's possible. Because all of these guys are also complete shit at their jobs. Something I've discovered is the more hours you work the less effort you put into those hours. So they might be 'working' 60 hours a week but they're only going at, like, 60% effort. Which means everyone else has to pick up that slack. 

I've worked around white guys, caucasian guys (trust me, there is a difference), black guys, and mexican guys... and every single mexican guy I have worked with, that I can remember, is like that. Works a thousand hours a week but doesn't really go at 100% for any of that."

Each hero can build basically any core damage items and make them work, and knowing when and where to get which ones makes all the difference. Really all it is is asking yourself two questions: what has to happen for me to die this game, and how do I kill enemy heroes this game.

The more you play core the easier it becomes to answer these questions. And mindlessly afk hitting creeps is the perfect time to think about what you need to spend your money on to make sure you don't die and enemy heroes do."

Macro-level play is FAR more important, especially the lower you go. That's not saying not being able to get last hits is acceptable, that's saying knowing when and where to play is more important than how you're playing.

Besides, how important is your individual skill level when it comes to a team game? What matters is how you operate inside of your team. Otherwise the best games of DOTA ever played would be the All-Star matches at TI, right? I mean, they are regarded as literally some of the best players for their role, right? So if you get the 5 best players and put them on a team that makes them unstoppable, right?

Fuck no. The best teams are the ones that make it to the finals. The people that have perfected their play down to the point where it really is the seconds that matter. Like Ana figuring out while in the middle of getting killed that if he sold an item he'd have buyback to help defend the push. The teams that play the finals may have 8+ players that weren't in the All-Star match, that aren't the 'best' at their roles, but they are groups of players that understand how to play this TEAM game.

How to play as a team and with the other four people you're queued with is FAR MORE IMPORTANT than you maximizing your CS. That attitude screams 'I'm stuck in the trench because my teammates aren't as good as me, that's why I lose.'

Yeah, cool, it's the supports 'job' to buy all the wards, I get it, but that doesn't mean you can't help out. Especially when you have an ability that pretty much tells you exactly where an enemy ward is.

You get a value point in Q to get good regen and a useful creep ability for your lane (I'm looking at you dispel satyr), you get a value point in your E to have a stun, and then everything else is W so that you're damaging two enemy heroes just by standing near them.

It's the same reason CM's Q nuke is better than the W stun during the laning phase, when you're constantly able to hit two heroes with it. Yes, for a single target it does less damage, but you're able to hit two targets when there are always two heroes in lane standing near eachother."

MovieDetails,fejbxbg,t1_fejbajc,1579166282.0,"In The Martian there was a group of higher ranking NASA officials that were trying to decide how they were going to help Matt Damons character, even though they would never be allowed to because then it would let out that NASA left someone alive behind on Mars (as they could and did safely assume this character was dead). Sean Bean plays one of these NASA people, and because a lot of NASA is a bunch of nerds and this was a secret meeting they decided to name the meeting after the LotR meeting.

Now whether or not it was called that in the book or if they decided to call it that for the movie because they had Sean Bean I do not remember. But it is still neat."

Losing a game because my mid last picked slardar into SF. Or because my cores aren't buying defensive items that will keep them alive.
