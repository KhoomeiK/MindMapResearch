depression,fffno7b,t1_fffnius,1579887862.0,Indeed! It’s like when you try to translate jokes and context.
depression,fffniqx,t1_ffffkq5,1579887772.0,That’s actually sad. I am sorry bro that they care so much.
depression,fffn70y,t1_ffexzkj,1579887575.0,"When you translate it, it loses a double meaning that the sentence had when it was understood in its original language. “Genie” in French can either mean genie or it can mean that you’re smart, that you have intellect, etc. So in the original language, it basically means that even though I didn’t rub a magic lamp, I still brought out “le genie”, which is a double entendre on the fact that “le genie” means the genie but also that it could mean the smarts/wisdom."

depression,ffeq5eq,t3_et6nbl,1579859931.0,"Those aren’t “friends”. I was kind of in a similar situation as you when I was in high school. I am not friends with nor do I talk to my those “friends” anymore, especially when the “you’re so annoying” came up."
depression,ffepzvh,t3_et5ofh,1579859692.0,"Fuck what everyone else says. Use the type of medicine that works best for you, and if that happens to be medicinal and therapeutic herbs, then that is fine :). Ganja beats pills any day."
arkhamhorrorlcg,ffeppyg,t3_et71to,1579859270.0,"Duke (from Ashcan Pete deck) has this interesting activated ability involving investigating in which you may move to a connecting location before you investigate with an intellect of 4, so you can often save an action and travel around easier. Ashcan Pete can be a lot of fun in solo play. Duke is a great tool for fighting and investigating, and Pete has a good willpower and an ok agility to add to Duke’s strength’s which compliments the weaknesses of Pete. 

In order to help protect Duke and to help with Pete’s lower hit points and sanity, I tend to use protective items to absorb the damage and horror, such as Leather Coat and Bulletproof Vest for health and Holy Rosary and Elder Sign Amulet for horror. 

Also, Duke actually does not take up an Ally slot, so I like to use Guard Dog to soak up damage from enemies because of the instant damage ability it has, and you may use an upgradable Ally such as Peter Sylvester to help soak up horror while giving you bonuses to certain attributes. Cards like Charisma will allow you to have more allies on the field (a good choice always being Dr. Milan Christopher), and cards like Flare and the upgraded version of A Chance Encounter are great for finding/getting allies."
depression,ffeo5g3,t1_ffehzy6,1579856894.0,Please tell me more?
depression,ffeo3n2,t3_et5s4m,1579856819.0,You probably look fine :).
depression,ffenwcm,t3_et5x78,1579856514.0,"J’ai pas touché de lampe magique, mais je fais sortir le genie."
depression,ffenmmi,t3_et1fhk,1579856114.0,"Let’s be honest, does depression ever really truly go away? I feel like it’s kind of always there, lingering around, and getting to me still."
selfharm,fdq0v80,t3_emhong,1578649309.0,"When one feels overwhelmed, we turn to what made us feel better or at ease in a particular moment, regardless of what it is. 

You need to replace your coping mechanism with something healthier hopefully because you’re bound to get triggered, so finding your triggers is a good spot to start. 

The important thing mostly is that your girlfriend should be able to feel comfortable and not feel ashamed to express how she feels at any time.

By the way, I am more likely to cut myself when I drink, so stopping my alcohol abuse (when I can) helps me stop something else too."
selfharm,fdq0lpm,t3_ekkxj8,1578648934.0,Wow! That moment feels so genuine and wholesome :). Very loving and caring. It’s a positive sign.
depression,fdq0eoi,t3_emnxt4,1578648657.0,"I still truly never feel happy, and I feel afflicted with what I have as if it never goes away, always lingering. 

I wrote this not too long ago on a different thread:

“I wouldn’t wish suicidal thoughts and depression on my worst enemy. 

I sometimes feel that my days are numbered regardless and that there’s nothing going to stop the way on how I feel before I collapse and shatter. The alcohol and cutting myself is only “temporary numbness”, fake bliss, but a dastardly and sly torment, leaving me somber, dejected, and downcast. I don’t want to feel this way. I feel nothing, and I am empty, yet somehow, I feel so much pain at once and so much despair, a disconsolate and agonizing affliction —a feeling that you cannot put a finger on or describe — but it eats away at you, and destroys you mentally and emotionally.”"
depression,fdq0a08,t3_emmdwc,1578648479.0,"It is completely normal to feel this way. School is stressful and it’s not for everyone. 

I strongly recommend just finishing your high school, and then try to get a job and just grind your way and others won’t complain and can’t complain if you work and act responsibly. 

I graduated high school, finished my CEGEP (which is 2-3 years of college as a post secondary, but precurses University). I dropped out of University and just focused on my job and work, and life is fine bro. You can be successful and happy even without a degree or diploma. Trust."

There are people out there that do care."

depression,fdpz3so,t3_emnbdm,1578646842.0,"Do what is best for your daughter! That is the key. You need to step up right here and hold your ground. The feelings will be intense, but things will get easier man, and with time, you’ll feel a clearer picture. 

The one person that you originally felt whom you couldn’t live without has suddenly become the person that you can’t live with. 

You need to take some time to reflect, and trust me, your feelings for her will never change the reality of what is really going on :’(."
