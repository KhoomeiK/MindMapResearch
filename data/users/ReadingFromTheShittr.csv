gaming,fcz3t57,t1_fcyys31,1578093095.0,"This is one of the things I loved about BotW.  Which is why I disagree with those that say it doesn't feel like a Zelda game.  To me, it feels a lot like the original NES entry.

Back then, they gave you a sword and basically said, ""Go beat the game, good luck.""  You could explore almost all of the overworld and take on the toughest monsters there with just a wooden sword.  In subsequent Zelda entries the games became more linear and many more areas became locked behind progression items.  While this mechanic can be rewarding as you play the game, I thought it also got a bit stale.   

Breath of the Wild?  IMHO, more like Breath of Fresh Air."
