That girl isn't worth a single iota of your time or emotion, and she certainly isn't worth your life. 

So please don't game-end.

Literally any girl you meet going forward will be a massive trade-up."
depression,fde5nlu,t1_fddhu40,1578331720.0,">How will being admitted to the hospital help me get back on my feet?

I was admitted to a psych ward when I was in my late adolescence. While not as extreme as your situation, I was well down the road. I was not pleased at first, but it helped me immensely.

I was in a new, clean environment. I was following a schedule. I met and interacted(sparingly) with people in similar situations.

For me, the greatest impact it had was breaking the pattern of self-neglect I had formed. It gave me perspective on how troubled I was, and potentially could be(there were some characters in there...) and when I left I felt a little more confidence in myself.

(It was nowhere as near as extreme as I ever expected it to be. I basically lived in a hospital for three months rent-free.)"
depression,fde4tol,t1_fddq082,1578331198.0,"THIS. THIS THIS THIS.

You need to find a person with the authority to IMMEDIATELY intervene in a meaningful way. You need to hammer-home how serious this is right off-the-bat and make sure they take action right away."
depression,fde4dsb,t3_ekuia8,1578330918.0,"Hell yeah dude I love everything about life.

I just hate living most of the time. 

It's a weird paradox. 

Like, when I look at myself or my situation I see no hope. But were I to look at a different person suffering identically, I could think of endless positive things to say. I have no interest in sharing my pain."
depression,fde2yry,t3_eksxke,1578330011.0,"It sounds to me like there's a disconnect between how your parents view your situation.

If you're comfortable with it, I would suggest you have a sit-down with your parents and thoroughly explain your experience up until now with depression. Clear up any misunderstandings your mother might have(unless you agree hospital treatment is necessary) and fill in any blanks in your Fathers understanding of your situation. (At one point I let my mother sit-in on a therapy session to give her perspective, helped a lot)

I would suggest writing down whatever points you want to bring up before-hand so you can be as co-herent as possible. Don't bring anyone else into it either, just explain your struggle as clearly as possible.

Living with family can be torture if they don't understand and respect your illness. Communication was the most important step for me.

Best of luck, and please don't game-end. Shit might suck now but it can always change, and so can shitty people if you work at them enough.

(That whole stroke business is miserable and I could only suggest you confront her about it as calmly as possible. She might not understand what she's doing, and if she does then... idk)"
depression,fde149v,t1_fddgrj8,1578328810.0,"You're obviously suffering, have you tried explaining to them where you're at?

If the people closest to you aren't supportive, maybe it's time to find a better environment for you to heal."
depression,fddz418,t1_fcxfifv,1578327468.0,">absolutely. you are a permanent slave to the feelings of others; even being depressed is a violent attack on their care for you.

I understand that feeling, I'm in a similar place quite often so I can't blame you.

I don't think Wittgenstein is the source for that quote, but he does have a similar piece."
depression,fcwygsw,t3_ejamne,1578043060.0,"Music is the key for me.

Occasionally, seeing something in life or in media can move me to tears(anime/tv/books/etc), but that's usually a burst of a particular emotion that's inspired by whatever I'm seeing/experiencing. It isn't focused in a way that's particularly cathartic.

Music however, totally unlocks me. It helps me focus on a particular thought/feeling, amplifies and sustains it. It's the only thing in my life that really makes me feel."
depression,fcwy504,t1_fcwth7c,1578042642.0,"That's silly and self-serving logic.

Speaking from personal experience, my life may as well have begun and ended when my brother took his life. Every single day I wake up, was the day my brother took his life. No matter how many years pass."
depression,fcwxxcp,t3_ej9fo3,1578042374.0,"It's hard to really encapsulate what is experienced by a person whose loved one takes their lives suddenly.

""People will miss you."" - is just a small piece of a massive, elaborate puzzle of reasons why 'not' to game-end. Most people, without experiencing it themselves(or even then from emotional barriers) would have a hard time speaking on the subject(or even properly comprehending it) and probably resort to these small pieces, rather than trying to paint a painfully-grandiose picture of why life is worth living.

There was a great poem, or quote that describes, or at least relates closely to my feelings on taking-ones-own life... but I can't quite recall the source so the jist of it is:

""My death does not belong to me, it belongs to those who will be there to live it.""

After 30 years of crippling depression, anxiety and ADHD, as well as dealing with the recent suicide of my kid-brother, that message only rings stronger.

Those in my life who would be affected by my death, deserve my best death and so do I."
CanadaPost,fbctca6,t3_e76ern,1576733188.0,"They do this to me on a regular basis, regardless of holidays. Any package I get shipped that requires a signature is always marked ""Out for Delivery"" and ends up sitting on a truck all day, while I get a slip in my mailbox(which is 10 feet from my front door) 

There used to be a time, a few years ago, when I was actually acquainted & trusted CPostmen. IDK if I've seen my mailmans face in three years. Shipping anything that doesn't go straight to my mailbox is a guaranteed trip down to the post office.

Sad new reality."
