The fact that he is a fire arms instructor of and by itself does not mean he is qualified to instruct people on the use of -that- weapon. It’s like having qualified on the Cessna Skyhawk.

The fee would be in the range of the gun being owned. It would be, for a hand gun $75 bucks. If you buy a gun it's going to cost money. If you're going to buy ammo that's going to cost money too. A fee to cover costs is part of the deal.

The amount of guns in the US being available is such a humongously huge amount that your 'one fell swoop' is practically impossible. The government doesn't have that many people to confiscate all those guns at once. It would physically be impossible.

> we are constitutionally given that right if we feel shit is too out of hand.

This belies your whole argument for having the guns. If you honestly think that 'shit' isn't too out of hand right now, with the current president in the White House, then honestly I don't know what to tell you. This man is a far greater threat to the United States then any state actor has been since the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the significance of which the current president didn't even understand when he visited the site.

At this very moment the free press is not free to report on the impeachment process. The Senate rules are such that Mitch McConnell wants to whitewash the president. This is a guy who is madly in love with Vladimir Putin, because in his dreams he wants to be that powerful; he has divulged state secrets, compromised important State assets, a republican specialty after Scooter Libby with malice aforethought willingly compromised an active duty CIA operator [and everybody she had been in contact with] for political reasons. Donald Trump does stuff like that between breakfast and lunch and twice before dinner, it's so common.

Donald Trump, champion of the common man, wouldn't piss in the mouth of any of the followers at his rallies, if their lungs were on fire. Donald Trump cares *only and exclusively* about Donald Trump. His policies are a direct danger to the national security interests of the United States.

And there you are, proud gun owner, defending the 2nd Amendment and making sure to have the constitutional right to bear arms in case shit gets out of hand. And, when shit does get out of hand, you do nothing.

People often act as if words mean anything to them, but in their actions you see that in reality they don't. Because those words would mean you have to do something while it is much more convenient to pretend you'd be doing something if the situation ever got out of hand. I have yet to hear where a 2nd Amendment afficionado goes to find a health insurance CEO and kicks him in the nuts for denying a kid insurance coverage because her doctor was out of network, they had a 'pre-existing condition' or the parents hadn't read Paragraph 9 of title 7 on page 55 of some insurance document. That kind of thing, where things get so out of hand that people don't even go to the doctor anymore because it is physically unaffordable, that's not something that's out of hand enough for you to do something about in the 2nd Amendment range.

And that's why I'm kind of 'meh' on the whole argument against defending oneself against the government. Because you really don't do any of that when it really counts."
Foodforthought,ff5nfgu,t1_ff5gzqo,1579601684.0,"Those fines have always been a joke. If the fine is 5% of what was embezzled, then it's just the cost of doing business. If the fine was 3x of what was embezzled, then you'd see a bunch of frowny faces."

pics,ff4knvy,t1_ff481pf,1579565927.0,"So, the thing here is: that is one hell of a big gun. People in the US, on a very frequent basis, use guns to cause mass harm. I remember the guy in Las Vegas shooting into the concert crowd. No laws were changed after that [that I'm aware of].

To answer the question: if the ownership of the weapon is within the law [gun permit, no criminal background] they can have it if they want it. I have no information on what the track record is for people owning that class of weapon and criminal activity. I don't have those numbers available, I'm not going to pretend I have a sensible answer to that.

Are they a danger? There is an elevated risk because they own the gun. The fact that the gun is there means there is now an extra way to solve 'a problem' that would not be there if the gun wasn't there. You never know when something goes *snap* inside their head. But it's not just that gun, obviously. Today, somewhere in America, a kid *found daddy's gun* and either shot themselves, their sibling, or they played with it and didn't check to see whether there was a round in the chamber. The presence of the gun is the risk factor. School shooters have used family member's legally obtained guns for their rampage. No gun no rampage.

I can see a use for hunting rifles and guns for self-defence. Guy breaks down the door, he weighs 350lbs, Sarah's 90lbs soaking wet holding her purse. Does Sarah have to be the victim of a guy who's going to assault her? I don't believe so. I hate being a victim. No amount of ninja kung fu shaolin bullshit is going to stop the guy from pounding her through the wall. But a shotgun with .00 buckshot might better be able to convey the message that a peaceful conclusion to the evening is much preferred.

I'm not wholly against the ownership of fire arms for those reasons. But assault rifles and a Barret M82 [although I'm partial to the M107 for sentimental reasons myself], those are not weapons that you need around the house.

I would use the first 4 words of the 2nd Amendment to have regulations in place such that every gun owner who is legally allowed to own a gun, can have their gun, but they would have to go to a place where they could be instructed in the proper use and maintenance and what applicable law for the use of same is in the State they're in. It would cost some money, because the instructors need to get paid, for a license, and the license would have to be renewed on a periodic basis. Every 5 years for a hand gun [if it's not a Dessert Eagle], shorter periods for heavier weapons when they're not hunting weapons.

- learn how to shoot the weapon

- learn how to maintain the weapon

- review applicable law

For every type of weapon they own they would need an updated license. Appropriate fees would apply. People who have served in the military where they had to use fire arms, would have a special license so that they don't have to prove they can shoot it. They would pay $25 for an update on local laws [which would be renewed if they moved to a different State]. Navy SEAL and other SOCOM operators would be allowed to have any non-nuclear weapon, because: seriously, they would have to pay $25 for an update on local laws.

I would want my citizens to have orderly access to fire arms. They would HAVE TO know how to operate and maintain it and be able to recite applicable law. If you can't operate and maintain a fire arm and you can't recite applicable law, then you don't qualify. The point is that these are machines constructed for the specific purpose to end life and then we're not fucking around. If you don't know what you're doing, you can't have them."

That was my only direct experience of Concorde but it sure left an impression."

You go out and you tell people about yourself. Explore your inner world, and you do, and share some stories.

Go out, talk to people, learn to give honest answers to questions. Especially since you're 20: fuck someone. Seriously. Get your groove thing going. Learn how to express yourself in that way.

Exactly. The reason being that you're going to fall within 'a fork' of users / usage. You're going to fall within the statistical averages of what someone your age, your gender, your ethnicity and whatnot do and buy. If there's a tidbit they don't know about you, they're going to assign a 'probable label' to you and just assume you're going to fall within a range.

As soon as your data set is large enough, say: if you're Facebook, it doesn't matter if one user only posts bogus information, they'll just cross-reference databases and build a profile on who you are from that data.

It's inescapable at this point.

Which is why we should have laws that enforce that the people who compile that information about you, make it mandatory for their information to be shared publicly. And if they have a problem with that, we should ask them: why is it ok for you to have that information about me, but it's not ok for me to have that information about you?"

Let them see how much they value privacy when they get theirs ripped apart.

If they use it against you, you use it against them. You'll always and invariably see that it's never quite as funny when it happens to them.

Also keep in mind that this movie was released early March 1990, which means it was made in the 1988/1989 time frame. The Berlin Wall was opened in December of 1989 and it was demolished in mid 1990. So this is very much a movie made in the days of the Cold War [albeit at the extreme far end of it]. This was not remembering the distant past. This was very much in the 'could have happened yesterday' mindset. It's fiction, of course, but not so far outside the realm of possibilities that it could never happen.
