He gets so little mention in media right now even being statistically tied for first, a win in Iowa will be a shock to the system and should catapult him up to get the national recognition he needs/deserves. 

Right now in most coverage you only hear about Bernie, Warren, Biden, ""the top 4"" and ""possibly Amy."""

As far as what value she brings, I suppose it'd be the same value any chairperson might. Help with campaign steering advice, act as a surrogate, help secure other endorsements, especially at the local level.
