I guess the funds backing those accounts could take a hit due to taxes on selling of assets (or do they? IIRC they pass on capital gains to you as a distribution.

My last sentence is more regarding the increase on capital gain brackets instead of unrealized gains. E.g. if I know next year all my long term cap gains will be at 37% then I'd sell everything now.  

Not anywhere close to a tax policy expert, but maybe a very gradual increase (1% per year over 10 years) could be an okay rollout. Or something like grandfather in long term rates for 5 years so people can harvest them without a sudden spike of volume.

I agree with you here. I also have a good chunk in equities, and making everyone realize unrealized gains would do some funky shit.  

My understanding of the proposal is this:  
1) Introduce additional brackets for capital gains so the top bracket is 37% instead of 20%. Maybe these will be at same brackets as income, or maybe they'd be a bit higher. Personally I prefer the latter so there is still some incentive for long term investing, though it does add complexity.  
2) Require capital gain harvest every X years for _high net worth individuals only_. 50 mil is probably a good cut off, similar to Warren's plan.  

FWIW, I think this makes sense. The cap gains will suck for me but I'm in a good enough position that I'll happily pay more taxes to fund important social service, e.g. universal healthcare.

There are a few things that I really feel should be bipartisan but they've been thoroughly opposed by conservatives, and that leads to a lot of frustration.

[Public opinions are shifting](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/) on both sides but Republicans representatives and leadership continue to deny the problem altogether and want to ""help"" the dying coal industry.

pics,fcw82qq,t1_fcw56cg,1578019293.0,"> Ajit Pai was put on the FCC commission by Obama. Trump 'promoted' him to chair, but clearly Obama had faith in him to begin with, so that seemed like a pretty straightforward decision.  

Only 3 members can be from the same party, so Obama must appoint a republican. He picked Ajit Pai at the recommendation of Mitch McConnell.   

Obama did not ""have faith in him"". In fact Obama is on the other side (pro net neutrality), and Pai is against. The FCC under Obama / Wheeler enacted Title 2 to achieve their net neutrality mandate. Pai rolled that back and has been actively dismantling net neutrality.  

By selecting Pai as chair Trump directly influenced the direction of the FCC and removed net neutrality.

> I personally believe the decision by the board was a bad one, but the US is a capitalist country and the choice is in keeping with that model, so I wasn't very surprised by it.  

I'm not sure how ""capitalistic"" has anything to do with this?  

Capitalist does not mean zero regulations. Cars have standards on how much emission they can output. Planes have regulations for safety. Banks have regulations to protect against over-leveraging of debt. The SEC regulates against insider trading.  

Now there are bad regulations (a-la regulatory capture) but in this case I don't think net neutrality is one of them.

> Still curious to know why you think the people who voted for Trump did so....  

I think a good chunk of people voted for Trump because of the R next to his name. It's very hard to generalize an entire population like this, but politics in a first past the post voting system is essentially a ""team sport"" and once you've picked a side it's hard to stand back and look at the whole picture.  

Other reasons are probably a mix between fear that Democrats will ""take their guns away"" (gun sales during Obama reached [record high](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-gun-industry-misses-obama-2019-05-07), though he never did do that, did he?), pro-life & anti-abortion sentiments, and hatred towards Hilary Clinton."

2) Store a timestamped entry for each trigger word heard.  
3) On the next ""real"" connection to the server (e.g. a real voice command due to the trigger word) piggy back encrypted metrics from #2 with it, and clear the internal memory.

I said the quantity of sub-1 mile driving has zero justification, right after listing some rare cases where they're justified.  

> I can tell you don’t live in the burbs  

I grew up in the burbs, my parents / sister still live here but I am now live in a more urban area. Currently I'm home visiting for the holidays and honestly, maybe suburb living is a luxury in itself. With our cold winters large detached homes take more power to heat (there are literally rooms in this house that are completely unused) and also leak that heat from all sides.   

> have kids  

Are school bus no longer a thing? I grew up riding them daily. My sister takes one to / from school right now.  

> or have to pick up groceries from the mini mall.  

If I lived in the 'burbs I'd do this:

1) Drive once a few month for long lasting costco-sized dry goods like rice, pasta, toilet paper, spices, oil, sauces and what not.  

2) Buy fresh produce & meats bought more frequently. A set of front & rear baskets on a bike or a [grocery trailer](https://wicycle.com/products/bike-trailers/cargo-shopper) should be more than sufficient for a sub-5 mile trip.  

In the 'burbs where I'm staying right now the nearest grocery store is less than 3km away, a sub 10 minute bike ride. Obviously this is less feasible during the winter (unless one is very dedicated) but for half the year it'd be very easy to get groceries with a bike.  

The entire suburb area is less than 5x5 KM which is _tiny_.

> Ignoring this as a fact is problematic and let’s not think this doesn’t affect the poorer the most. The rich are the ones who can live downtown, the poor who commute 45-60 min by car do so because it’s the closest area they can live. Carbon taxes hurt them the most, but will not change where their home is or where their work is.  

Except the carbon emission policies returns all of the revenue, and the fee is equal regardless of the emission method. Whoever emits more (the people taking 4x flights in your example) will pay more.  

Also is it _really_ cheaper to commute 60 minutes a day? Sure, on paper the rent is cheaper but that's missing out on the true cost of commuting (time, car, fuel, insurance, etc.).  

> So what you are requesting is that cities basically redesign themselves for density to combat climate change.  

I think the solution is a combination of:  

 * High throughput public transit with high density housing near public transit.  
 * Improved bike infrastructure.  
 * Convincing companies to allow remote work / work from home.  

But to start #1 and #2 there's a catch-22. People have to be willing to give up their cars & lanes on the road to enable things like this, but they aren't. And you can build all of that but if people don't use it then it's all for naught.  

Remote work is the best hope without massive infrastructure re-works but only certain professions can benefit from it. Even then there will still be non-work related transportation requirements that rely on #1 and #2.  

And for the people who can afford suburban life style, congrats, you can keep it! Just chip in a bit more for the extra emissions to pay for the _luxurious_ 3km drive to a grocery store."
canada,fck84s8,t1_fcis2ms,1577719211.0,"> Will that person continue to not drive if they have kids or get a new job?  

The fact that flights are considered ""luxury"" while driving is ""normal"" is part of the problem. Driving should _not_ be ""normal"", but rather a luxury as well.  

There are often no good alternatives to flying. A 3 day trip by train / bus across North America vs. a 6 hour flight is a no brainer. If you're crossing oceans that's also a barrier.  

On the other hand, there are _plenty_ of things that can easily replace driving but people are simply not willing to do so. [In the U.S. over 10 billion miles are driven where the trip is less than 1 mile](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPdf.cgi?Dockey=P100MLPQ.pdf). Often alternatives to driving are actually faster, especially with traffic congestion taken into account.

There are, of course, scenarios where one must drive. Hauling large quantities of items, people with disabilities, and certain distances do require a car. But these are the exception, not the norm. The majority of the population driving sub-5 miles for their daily commute to work is entirely unnecessary, and the quantity of sub-1 mile trip has no justification.  

Fees on carbon emissions will create incentives for people to fly less as well as drive less."
