Meal prep is a lifesaver for me. If I had to make my lunch and dinner every single day id be doing takeout all the time.

Yes. BUT. a lot of the louder people in the FA/HAES movements today ARE glorifying being fat, are proud of being ""infinifats"", and think they are ENTITLED to things (especially sex from conventionally attractive/fit people). And anyone who doesnt cater to them (or isnt attracted to them, or suggests moderation, or etc.) is fatphobic and promoting the genocide of fat people.

It started out as 'fat people are people not punchlines' and 'just because youre fat doesnt mean you cant make healthy choices for yourself and love yourself' - which if you love yourself you want to take care of your self and your body and your health - and a few loud people have turned it into infantile whining and self enforced helplessness."

Like if they werent wounded/disabled/depressed/their girlfriend died 5 years ago, youd be married already, and youre just a terrible person for not being able to look past their problems.
