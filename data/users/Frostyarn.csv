Flourescent fuscia 
Flourescent safety orange
Flourescent lemon
Radioactive
Purple pop

I don‚Äôt think any of their cotton dyes glow, you‚Äôd have to call them and ask. But any silk scarf or shawl or wool item will light up brightly.

It was a quick, simple procedure, no regrets at all. When my son was 3.5 we decided to have number 2 and I was pregnant that month. I thought I‚Äôd feel guilty about having had an abortion and then planning a pregnancy but I felt totally fine. Still do.

Thoughts on Dharma: They have a lot of redundant blues and reds, some of the colors fizz, gel, cake, separate or bleed no matter what you do. A well performing dye might have a bad batch and then go back to working flawlessly. Dharma does not mill to a high standard and it‚Äôs not a great dye brand for newbies, who often attribute problems with a bad dye batch to themselves and their inexperience.

I personally dye on pro chem washfast acid now and teach on it as well. I started dyeing in 2008 and the colors look identical and perform identical all these years later.

Jacquard is overpriced and a small range of colors (40 vs Dharmas 86 and pro chems over 100). I know in Europe that‚Äôs all you can get and high import fees make other brands hard to come by."

So, we combined my last name and shortened his (Ross +/- Leidenfrost) to create Frost. Half his name, half mine, way cuter. I changed my name before we got married and he took it. So he has a maiden name on his passport and I don‚Äôt! 

He was the last living male Leidenfrost tho, his Dad was surprisingly cool about it."

abortion,fdbw20z,t3_ek9enq,1578262773.0,"Hi! I‚Äôm in recovery, 11.5 years sober now, had 2 abortions I never regretted.

When someone wants to stay sober, there‚Äôs nothing in the world that will make them use. When someone wants to use, there‚Äôs nothing in the world that will stop them.

Your abortion is his excuse to relapse.

By the way, kids are waaaaay more stressful than the psychological understanding he‚Äôs experiencing. If he can‚Äôt handle your abortion without using, how‚Äôs he gonna handle the cost of daycare, medical care, screaming all night every night for six months etc? Kids don‚Äôt get or keep people sober, but the stress of them leads a lot of people to relapse.

You need to move on from him, he‚Äôs gums need a minimum of a year sober and intensive therapy to even begin to be ready to be someone‚Äôs boyfriend. Please consider that this relationship has no future with someone loaded and on a hair trigger for relapse."

While it does unleash the hunger of a teenage football team about an hour after I take it, the specific weight gain mechanism comes from tripled blood sugars. I have had extensive testing done plus 6x daily blood sugars monitoring to find the source of the spikes. Bacon and eggs gave me a crazy high reading as though I‚Äôd eaten pancakes. I dosed off seroquel for 6 weeks and instantly dropped 20 lbs, but had rebound symptoms and had to go back on it. I‚Äôm at half my dose now and am soooo hoping that keto works. One day in so far."

abortion,fc7aq6f,t1_fc5xn4k,1577502040.0,"Oh man, sounds like you‚Äôre between a rock and a hard place.

But one thing I‚Äôd say is, an abortion IS taking responsibility for your actions. Children are NOT the negative consequence of sex. That is a Christian guilt trip they‚Äôve been selling since the dawn of time.

No kid deserves to be born into a situation where they aren‚Äôt desperately wanted between two partners that created them with intention. I had a fucking horrible childhood, which is the norm and the natural consequence of having children just because you got pregnant. It‚Äôs soooo rare that it actually works out beneficially for the parents and kid. My mom had 4 oopsie babies who all need extensive therapy and meds to get over the trauma of a fractured, poverty stricken childhood. 

Allow yourself the gift of hitting the reset button, and allowing yourself the opportunity of planned parenthood down the road if that‚Äôs what you end up wanting. You‚Äôre doing no one any favors by continuing this pregnancy.

It would be one thing if you were like ‚ÄúI really want this baby but finances or the Dad is threatening or I live in a car.‚Äù But it‚Äôs abundantly clear if you had a time machine to that sexual encounter, you would have prevented the conception. All you‚Äôre doing is taking a single extra step to prevent the pregnancy from going any further.

You‚Äôll be ok. 1 in 4 women will do this in her lifetime."
