Megaman,fepi2yv,t1_f42akzl,1579321058.0,">At this point if they're not pushing out a new game every year it seems  fair to guess that they're being cautious in resurrecting the franchise  and that they don't want to see the mid-00s happen again, not that they  have no interest in continuing to make new Mega Man.

What do you think of this claim? And what do you think of all the people who look down on actors for this kind of behavior?"

The protagonist is Chara reborn upon their grave thanks to their gaining of a new soul, which is why they ALWAYS have the name the player chose during battle. They have amnesia, and, in a commentary on the relationship between player and player-character, they are molded by the player's actions, becoming much worse, or much better, than they ever were - because the new soul they gained is the player's.!<
