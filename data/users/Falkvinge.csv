btc,fgxekem,t3_f0r1tq,1581171943.0,"Hmm. I'm missing the point where the flag SIGHASH\_FORK is or-ed into a value before the signing takes place (the BCH transaction replay protection). Where does this happen now?

Specifically this:

`Transaction tx = txBuilder.BuildTransaction(true, SigHash.ForkId | SigHash.All);`

See [https://github.com/Swarmops/Swarmops/blob/master/Logic/Support/BackendServices/ReturnBitcoinEchoUtxoOrder.cs](https://github.com/Swarmops/Swarmops/blob/master/Logic/Support/BackendServices/ReturnBitcoinEchoUtxoOrder.cs) for my code that returns a transaction less a return fee. It uses an older, but working, version of NBitcoin to handle Bitcoin Cash."

As always, no promises about when, or if, it will be ready, whatever ready means in this case. It's public domain and some 160,000 LoC though, so if anyone wants to use it, or do something else with it, that's cool too.

The current obstacle is tax reporting and cryptocurrency inventory -- specifically that you need to keep track of when you got every single piece of non-presentation currency, according to your inventory policy, in order to declare capital gains/losses correctly."

For fraud to come into play, you'd need to have an intention of never fulfilling a contract. The difference is rather important in my opinion."
