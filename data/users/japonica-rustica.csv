Physics,ff8t96w,t3_esasc0,1579695238.0,If you had some device on a spaceship that could block gravity behind it then it would be pulled forwards.  Remember though that gravity is the weakest force. Gravity from stars is absolutely minuscule so it would only accelerate your ship incredibly slowly.

I just think it’s interesting that even some (relatively) modern bacteria can go into an almost suspended animation and be able to be revived millions of years later. Seems like they’re ready to be blasted of the Earth to travel through space and seed another planet. 

Either way it will be cool to get an answer.  I hope it’s one of the things we discover in my lifetime."
todayilearned,fed3nl3,t1_fed35op,1578997190.0,"Time. 13 billion years versus a few million years. It obviously isn’t an entirely trivial process as we haven’t been able to replicate it yet. Also, the first signs of life on earth appeared incredibly quickly after the crust had cooled enough to support liquid water. Seems like it had arrived already or was continually arriving and took hold as soon as conditions were suitable. 

I’m not saying it didn’t spring up in multiple places but it seems to me that the advantage of being able to survive embedded in cold dark rock for millions of years using minimal energy is there for a reason."

japanlife,fcu2ynq,t1_fcu27f4,1577970954.0,"Even worse than a normal Japanese house. Most amateurs designing a house worry about keeping water out but don’t consider that you also need to allow water (in the form of water vapor) out of the house. A single person will create a couple of liters of water a day just by breathing. When you don’t design an effective way for that water vapor to leave the house then you get condensation, rot and mold. Containers are almost perfect at keeping water out but are equally bad at letting it out."
japanlife,fcu2f7j,t1_fctzllt,1577970396.0,"It’s not that the problems can’t be solved it’s just that it will always end up being much more expensive than a traditionally built structure. The beauty of containers is that they are easily and cheaply transportable and fairly robust. As soon as you cut holes in them or join them together you lose that advantage and gain a whole bunch of negatives like having to cut and weld corton steel and use extremely expensive spray foam insulation and and anti fungal agents.  Any cuts you make for doors or windows seriously degrade the structural strength of them.  I used to run a container architecture website and was really keen to build a house out of them myself but after a lot of research I decided against it. 
All the places that work and look good end up having super luxury build costs and the ones done cheaply end up never finished or discarded due to miserable living conditions. 

The only container structure I still sometimes think about is a traditionally built cabin type structure that fits completely inside a 40’ high cube and slides out on rails to give you a 40’ slightly smaller than container living space and 40’ container for storage but it would be pretty expensive still."
