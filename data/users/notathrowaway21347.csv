interestingasfuck,ffb1e4x,t1_ffaz8or,1579749380.0,"Grading curves are set up such that a C is the average score, D and B being one standard deviation from that, and F and A being two standard deviations.

C corresponding to a 70% is an artifact of the transition from letter grades (which is still largely how GPA is calculated) to numerical grades. How exactly it ended up that way is probably mostly arbitrary, but you can see some sense in it; anything less than half of the assignment probably shouldn’t even be considered.

Grading on a curve (a legit curve, not a “add 10 points to everyone’s score” curve) is less common than it used to be, but “C is average” has stuck around as an idea, at least, and some professors still keep it in mind when considering the quality of the work they’re grading."

Or are you asking how many hours you need to work to afford some amount of bananas *using that countries currency*? The pile of bananas per 5 *local currency* is probably about the same size for each country, barring unusual ecological events in regions where that country sources it’s bananas or major fluctuations in the countries currencies value.

>It’s going well. What I meant was that after 17 years of playing, I had accepted that the guitar is the instrument that I can communicate my ideas on most quickly. I just always wanted to be a piano player because my brothers and uncles are all really good at piano, and it seemed like an easier instrument to compose on. But I enjoy playing the guitar very much. Part of my discomfort also stems from the fact that I consider myself to be a very brute player. I’m not a guitarist with a lot of finesse or warmth, and I’m always awed when I hear those qualities in the playing of others. Most of the time I’m so much of a brute that I pull the strings out of tune.
