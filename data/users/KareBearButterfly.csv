This poor woman needs therapy.  Perhaps she never dealt with the abandonment from her father and this character represented a stable male figure in her life in some subconscious way.  Sounds like she may not be open to help from you, but hopefully someone can get her the help she needs."

running,fcj9ujo,t3_ehehll,1577680879.0,It's all about the music for me.  Running on a treadmill requires a specific playlist of songs you LOVE that you don't listen to any other time.

One of the contributors is Caroline Hamilton who is a historian in ballet costume development.   So far from what I've read costume development evolved in conjunction with functionality and as part of the artform and storytelling.   It's beautifully intertwined."
