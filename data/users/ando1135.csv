FriendshipAdvice,ffbkqp6,t3_esow1v,1579770014.0,"The only way to get over your anxiety is to put yourself in these uncomfortable situations and start addressing the issues you start to feel. You don’t have to be the center of attention, but if you hear them talking and can find a way to chime in, do it. This is all very easily said and difficult to do, I know, I have social anxiety. But you have your friend whom you’re comfortable with there so it’s not like you’re just alone by yourself. Don’t use them as your security blanket, just know you have someone to fall back on should you start withdrawing. It’s easier to back out and hide in the comfort of your room...but is that really how you want to live the rest of your life? Don’t you wish you could just go with the flow and meet random people and make a connection? I feel like baby steps are in order here....start with saying hi to a stranger, maybe sharing a quick small chat with a cashier while paying for your stuff...these little things make you more confident when socializing with strangers. Just know, a lot of it is just your own mind psyching you out so ignore that voice in your head that’s telling you no one cares what you have to say or that what you do say is stupid....the people that are able to freely talk to others don’t worry about sounding dumb or looking stupid; in fact, that makes them interesting."

FriendshipAdvice,ff2jbxj,t3_eracf3,1579508724.0,"So I need a little more context...are you a girl, a boy? 3 months and not even hanging out seems like too little time to really have that kind of difficulty letting go...I guess if you had a crush on him and didn’t want to admit it to yourself or him, then maybe I can see that happening but again, it was such a short amount of time. Maybe you don’t miss him so much, maybe you miss the idea of ‘what could have been’.  Maybe that feeling is mutual. It seems he’s reaching out too, even if it’s just by following you on Instagram. maybe you should make the first move and ask if he’s like to get something to eat....maybe bury the hatchet once and for all over some petty reason you guys had the falling out. 
I had a falling out with a friend in college after 3 years of friendship...he was my best friend. Over the years he’d add me on fb etc and then I’d remove and he’d add again until I just left him in my friends list. He’d wish me happy birthdays through the years, I pretty much moved on but I felt inclined to reach out and apologize for my side of the incident all those years ago (9 years) and we reconciled in 2018. The friendship isn’t the same since we don’t really talk or see each other as much but it’s good to know there’s no animosity between us anymore. Reach out, see what happens, you might be surprised. If you don’t, nothing changes, if you do and he rejects the idea, things still the same and you can move on knowing you tried and things will stay the same."

Initiate once or twice and wait for an initiation on their part....if it comes, then go forward, if it doesn’t, then put less effort on that person...chances are they have too much going on or other friendships/relationships that take priority or are simply looking for someone to kill time with on the occasion but not to build a friendship. It’s fine, all these kinds of relationships have their place, but put in effort only equal to what you receive.

I would advise you two take a break from each-other to figure things out since he’s not the kind of support you need at this point in time.

You can try to see if you can be included into his group of friends activities but doing that too often might backfire as it might look clingy and desperate. As a rule of thumb I have to ask, do you have other feelings for him other than friendship? These feelings tend to turn into jealousy when you see that person having fun with others because you want them to yourself. If not, I’d try to reach out to him and see if maybe you can try joining in on one of his group activities...see how he responds to that. If he asks why or is a bit hesitant, it may mean he wants to keep things separate, which you would have to respect.

If you plan on just trying it out for the contract term, then go with literally any company out there since it doesn’t matter, you’re coming back anyways. 

You need to factor in your cost of living in japan with your pay. Sure it may be 250k a month, but after taxes, your food, rent, bills, transportation, etc. you could be looking at a small take home pay so I wouldn’t expect you to be saving much.

Do you have any idea how much a gym membership goes for in japan? You’re looking at $50-$100+/month.

It’s not easy in the slightest to move to another country, acclimate to their culture, and not be able to communicate with the people and then live there and work too. Sure, it would be an experience, but don’t go thinking you’re gonna be rich working in japan, because you ain’t."
