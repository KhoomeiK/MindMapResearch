intermittentfasting,ffjz2xt,t1_ffjxfne,1580010914.0,"Great job. Just need to keep chipping away at it. 

I actually shocked myself hitting 199 lbs today because I ate out yesterday and had a big meal, much bigger than I expected but I then couldn't eat again the same day and also did a gym and sauna session after (I join my friend here from time to time)."
intermittentfasting,ffjykzq,t3_eu1en5,1580010517.0,"After getting the correct diagnosis for a long-term illness that is easily managed with medication, I finally had the energy to try to attempt to get myself in a healthier place physically.

My doctor wrote ""intermittent fasting"" on the back of my prescription as I was leaving after my diagnosis. I read up about it and started on it within a few days.

I started with 16:8, sometimes not staying within it, within a week I was adapted to the fasting. Not long after I gave in to the suggestion of a friend that I try Keto, but I only lasted a couple of weeks because I felt unwell practically the whole time while doing it.

Since then it has been straight IF, with the window getting smaller and smaller until eventually I settled on 20:4, after having dabbled with OMAD a little.

I eat at 12.30pm every day during the week, where I have good dinner provided at my canteen. 

I usually then have 2 poached eggs and homemade brown bread at some at around 4 or 4.30pm after I get home, with a cup of coffee. I generally don't eat, or drink(coffee) after that.

On the weekend I often eat out or get dinner with family, but moderation is key.

I stay away from alcohol if I can help it at all, as any time I've allowed myself to, just a few beers can set me back a considerable amount of time.

In terms of exercise, at the beginning it was just walking, later doing some exercise bike, but eventually I graduated to some running with NoneToRun, but since I am still obese, I ended up abandoning that specific plan, in favour of run/walk intervals that more closely match where I'm at. Hopefully I reach a tipping point soon where I can run for more than a minute or two at a time.

My ultimate goal is probably around 150 lbs, but I just keep it going one day at a time.

I celebrate each stone (14 lbs) and half-stone, as well as 20lbs intervals and big ones such as the above 200lbs mark.

I try to run 4-5 times a week but I'm still obese, causing some pain issues in my rib area and I also started playing pickup soccer as well as a weekly squash game that I enjoy a lot.

When I tried Keto, it failed ultimately but got me to kick sugar completely and I tend to avoid it mostly now."

>2: Track and log you progress.

When I was starting out, I got advice from lots of place and read a lot, and the prevailing wisdom seemed to be not to drive yourself crazy weighing yourself too much.

I'm the opposite, I like to weigh myself twice a day so that I know what sort of range I swing between during the day and I always know if I'm going well or if I maybe am overdoing and need to eat a bit more.

>3: Do weights.

I've been putting off doing weights, but I'm getting held back by my lack of flexibility and complete lack of upper body strength, so I'll have to bite the bullet.

>5: Diets work. All diets work. But not all diets work for everybody.

Absolutely. I would even say that, depending on the person, the diet that works for them might not always work for them.

If you're dieting to lose a lot of weight, what you start out with might not be the best one when you're well into what you planned.
