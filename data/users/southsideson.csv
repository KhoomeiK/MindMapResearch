politics,ffixbjk,t1_ffi6p87,1579984996.0,"the tricky thing people aren't talking about is where those delegates go.  If bernie has 25-30% you can assume he's going to get delegates in almost every precinct, but if you're 10-20%, you're going to have some precincts you hit 15% and some you don't but, where they don't, now they're free to go to another candidate, like if buttigieg and Biden are both at 14% at a site, they'll probably be yelling back and forth at each other, trying to convince someone to come over to make a candidate viable.  Where will all of the caucus goers support when their candidates aren't viable.  I have a feeling Bernie is good with Yang, worse with klobuchar and Warren and buttigieg.  Warren should be better, but my guess is with her drop and bernie's rise, a lot of that move was Warren voters who were kind of on the fence and put off by the ""bernie said a woman could never win"" deal, and already moved over, sure some will still go to bernie, but it might not be better than 50/50.

As far as I know, what happens then, is at each individual caucus, if a caucus goer is supporting a non-viable candidate, then they can choose which viable candidate to support.  So what really matters is where Warren, Yang, Klobuchar, etc voters go.  Bernie could be beating Biden by a lot after the first count, but then when the nonviable candidates supporter choose who to support, if they all happen to go to Biden, he could end up with more, its going to be really important where those candidates supporters go.  I suspect Bernie will do well with Yang supporters, poorly with Buttigieg supporters, and  Warren supporters will be mixed.  The one caveat with Warren supporters, is because how much ideology they share, I suspect with her big drop, there were a lot of fence sitters between the two, and the most open to Bernie may have already switched camps."

He had 60 democratic senators, that just seems unimaginable today, but these states that seem out of reach, aren't 70% republican, They're like 54-46 or better.  Texas Republicans won their senate seat in 2018 by less than 2%.

DNC wants to pin their hopes on Biden because he can go peel off those few TRump voters who would like a little more moderate president.  Which honestly, I don't even believe the thesis, I believe that Sanders would probably pull more than Biden, but let's go with the thesis that Biden can pull those centrists.  There is a very small piece of the pie that Biden is fighting with trump for.  Trump supporters are pretty fervent.  For the argument, lets say 95% of Trump Supporters would vote for him if he shot someone on 5th avenue.  Some of those voters will are done with trump regardless, and Biden is going to try to sway a few percent of the 2016 Trump voters that would consider a conservative Democrat.

Honestly, I don't want to get complacent, I know people think Bernie is the only one that can win, and they think if Biden gets the nomination, he'll lose.  I think Biden stands at a pretty high chance to win, but he'll win with drawing in moderate conservatives that just can't handle Trump's style, who will Vote Biden, then R down the ballot.  Look at Obama's 58-60 seat senate, that was due to him bringing in voters that hadn't voted before.  Biden is going to fight over 2% of the electorate with Trump, Sanders is aiming at the 50% of voters that didn't vote  in 2016.  Some of those should be pretty easy to reach, they voted in 2008 and 2012, then couldn't be bothered with 2016.  Biden needs to peel like 30-40% of that  ""Trump voters that are possibly up for grabs"" to win, and its not going to move the needle in the legislature.  Sanders only needs a few percent of the 50% of non-voters, and if he gets that, Senate seats that no one thought they would see in their lifetimes go democrat are now up for grabs, like TX, NC, KY."

You gave him 1 day to ship when he has 3 day handling, and its a long weekend.  Its likely he's away from his computer.  Unless there is something else with his store that makes you question whether or not he's going to ship it on time, wait until the time for him to ship is passed."

Its a long weekend here, and he may have taken a vacation over the long weekend.  I don't always answer questions over the weekend.  If you're going to get bent of shape with him for handling the shipping of your item within the timeframe that he has in his listing, because its that important to you that it be on time, you should contact the seller before you buy."
Ebay,fes3sko,t3_eqfcmo,1579361091.0,"No returns really only works on honest people, and do you really want an honest person that for whatever reason doesn't want your item.  If they're going to be dishonest, all they have to do is claim there is something wrong with it and you're stuck paying return shipping.  As a buyer, when someone has 'no returns', it kind of sticks out and makes me think twice about buying something.  Even though I've never returned anything on ebay, if someone was $1 more but offered returns, I'd probably buy from them.  I see a lot of people in forums that have no returns, and it seems like a lot of them go that way because they they have issues selling, maybe don't describe their items issues well, and they get a lot of returns, and think putting no returns on an item will fix their problems."

yes, it should, but you really should print out your labels, on average you'll save 2-4 on shipping with ebay labels over paying at the post office.  all you need is a printer, and a scale.  when i started, I would go to the grocery store and weigh an item until i got my scale, but it was only a couple days.  you can get a scale for about $20 shipped from ebay or amazon.

I wonder how much of support is singularly tied to supporters feeling that he'll win.  If he comes in second or 3rd, I wonder how resilient Biden's support will be.  Sanders' supporters 49% chance of victory seems like a lot closer to reality than Biden's.  

A strong victory in Iowa could really catapult him to the front, which he needs. He can't win with a plurality, he really needs to win outright and get close to or over 50%."
