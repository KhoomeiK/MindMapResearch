Idk how much different byleth is going to play, but it seems like a lot of moves functionally act like a sword character."

wholesomememes,fef5rwr,t1_feeldh7,1579048842.0,"It's not that. It's more the fact that you never mentioned the caregiving part of it. You just talked about his want for all women to be large due to his sexual preference, then brought up how he tries to make you larger by giving you more food. If it is just out of care, then that's great."

If you need someone here for you, I'm willing to do that. As for the insecurity, that face, those eyes, and even the glasses imo are adorable. Finally, even with the extra 100lbs, there are people who either don't care or even like it. Obviously try to lose it for your health, but don't worry about just looks. You look great."
