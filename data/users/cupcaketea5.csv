TrueCrime,fc17r9u,t1_fc14cht,1577310670.0,"That is very true. Edit: Sadly, it is not adults focusing on little girls’ prettiness. It is little girls themselves too.

Some adults do want to see their daughters pretty. But even at a young age, little girls focus on their appearances and some parents might go along with making them feel pretty.

Some parents want to show off their children which is really bad. But the biggest harm is when little kids feel insecure about their appearances."
