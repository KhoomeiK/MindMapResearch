My mum has done something similar in the past. I think it's a funny story, so I'll share it here.

My mum worked with chemistry where they used pure ethanol to clean with. She and her colleagues often noted that they'd used a bit more than they actually used and then brought the rest with them home as free spirits for parties. They mixed it with water and various essences, like rum or whisky, to imitate proper spirits. Sure, they taste wasn't exact, but it worked. At one party, they had put a whisky blend into a bottle of a fine aged single malt to make it seem a bit more palatable. They then used it for Irish coffee. Except one of the party-goers who fancied himself a whisky aficionado who recognised the bottle and refused to mix such a fine whisky with coffee, so he drank it pure throughout the rest of the night, never realising that it was a mix of pure ethanol, water, and some cheap whisky essence. Most of the party knew and had a good laugh about it.

vegan,feohlk0,t1_feocz6l,1579300303.0,"> Animals whose lives are cut short MERELY for our gustatory pleasure is by definition unnecessary suffering

Personally, I don't care what the reasoning behind it is. Either it's suffering or it's not. The animals don't care why they suffer, they only care about suffering or not, so that's also my position.

I don't think animals have the conscious thought required to know whether or not they want to live. All they have is an evolutionary driven survival instinct, which means it is without a will. It's just a force of nature, like a ball getting pulled towards the Earth by gravity. Going against such a force of nature is no more evil than lifting the ball.

Because of that, I don't consider ending animal life as suffering. But this makes it sound as if it's some black or white thing, when in reality is a spectrum. We're animals too, so why should it be any different for us? Well, we have conscious thought. That's not the case for animals. Some animals show signs of relatively high intelligence, like apes or dolphins. Pigs to a certain extend too, but less than apes and dolphins. This means my position is fluid and can be changed. From what I can tell, the evidence of research into animal intelligence does not put pigs into the category of having deliberate conscious thoughts. But as the research progresses, this may change.

I don't subscribe to the idea that any animal dying is suffering, as this would by definition include all animals, including insects and microscopic animals, like tardigrades. There has to be a line somewhere, and I put mine at sapience as it seems the most logical to me. Some will disagree with me, and that's okay."

And given the relative lack of intelligence in farm animals, I think it's fair to assume that they don't have any conscious thoughts of wanting to live, only survival instincts. So I don't see the killing of animals as immoral, which is why I'm not fully vegan. To me, they're given a life they otherwise wouldn't live and what then matters is not the duration of that life, but the quality of it. And if it's a high quality life that I would view as being worth living, then that to me is what makes the meat ethical.

That's good. Really good.

> In every measure of sleep duration and quality, the Malagasy population experienced shorter and lower quality sleep when compared to similarly measured postindustrial values. The population slept for a total of 6.5 h per night and napped during 89% of recorded days. We observed a peak in activity after midnight for both sexes on 49% of nights, consistent with segmented sleep. 

So, short and poor sleep. According to whom? A bunch of anthropologists? That's where a couple of actual sleep scientists would help.

And what does ""a peak in activity after midnight"" mean? That they only slept segmented 49% of the time? That doesn't sound very segmented to me.

That's from reading the abstract. I haven't read the entire paper, but I may do that later today."

Is there a way to sort the research articles from your link based on discipline?

AyyMD,fe44brw,t1_fdvvjbt,1578855692.0,"According to Forrest Norrod, in relation to EPYC, [""[Zen 2] was more of an evolution of the Zen microarchitecture that powers first-gen Epyc CPUs -- Zen 3 will be based on a completely new architecture.""](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/technology/amd-inks-new-server-cpu-deals-15170073)

In other words, the MCM redesign where the IO die is separate from the cores is simply an evolution of the 4 chip design used for Naples.

The move to 7nm from 12 and 14nm is not an architectural change. It's a die-shrink. Think of it like Intel's old Tick-Tock cadence. Tick is die-shrink, while Tock is new architecture.

The upcoming Comet Lake will have 10 cores at the top, but it's still just another evolution of Skylake, which launched with 4 cores at the top.

Zen 2 was an evolution as well, according to Norrod, which must mean the change to chiplet is not as architecturally complicated that it would require a complete redesign. Zen 3 will, if we are to trust Norrod, which I can't see a reason why we shouldn't."

That, or its HBM2 again, which would make it even more expensive. Either path will be difficult.

And before AMD is ready to launch it, I think Ampere will be pretty much ready to go. And that comes on 7nm, and probably with some architectural improvements over Turing as well. Until AMD has something completely different up their sleave, it's not looking too bright for them against Novideo."

[Here's total system power consumption of the 3900X at 224W in Blender, which is 60W higher than the 3700X.](https://youtu.be/oDVUdpcKZMA?t=648)

[Tom's Hardware shows CPU only, where AIDA stress test results in a power draw of 142W, compared to 90W on the 3700X.](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ryzen-9-3900x-7-3700x-review,6214-3.html)

Given these two figures, the actual peak power consumption lies about 35-40% higher than the TDP value on Ryzen CPUs (90W is 138% of 65W, while 142W is 135% of 105W). 122W is well within that limit, but it depends on what you're doing with the chip. What kind of workload? Is it running completely stock?

If you don't want your 3900X to draw this much power then try undervolting it a bit and run it slightly slower. Going from 4.3GHz to just 4.0GHz has a much larger impact than you'd think considering the very similar performance levels. But whether or not that makes sense for you depends on your usecase."
