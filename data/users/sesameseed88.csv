AMDHelp,fendn9a,t3_epziym,1579282441.0,"It's as simple as 5700 XT drivers are no good for older games. I had this problem too, I could run RDR 2 and Metro Exodus and BL3 on high/very high with no problems @ 1080p. The second I tried older/indy games, it would stutter, lag, lock up like crazy. I did the driver dance, tried several, but each one performed differently for different games. It just got annoying. So now the 5700 XT is in a box, hoping for AMD to up their drivers game, and I'm daily using a 2070 super with 0 issues.

5700 XT is an incredible piece of hardware but AMD's software support for this card just sucks.

edit: I had problems with Archeage as well, tried drivers 19.9.2, 19.10.1, 19.12.3 (2020 Adrenalin), nothing worked well for me but I stopped playing so it wasn't a big issue."
