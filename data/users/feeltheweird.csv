coldurticaria,fe6oxjq,t1_fd7c7vu,1578898709.0,Ummm wait what. You mean it can get worse as time goes on???

AmItheAsshole,fcz4zcn,t3_ejni8s,1578093774.0,"YTA but more thoughtless than anything. I’m surprised it didn’t come up in conversation at all to be honest. I feel like if I had to write a bio or a anything like that I’d be running it by my SO until it was perfect. I’m sure it will blow over; that was likely his gut reaction but I can see why he is upset. It probably broke his heart a bit to not be the one you dedicated your big performance to or to even be mentioned as someone to whom you are grateful. I get you and your friend had big dreams together and you wanted to honor him but your big dreams came true with the help of your husband and that should be honored too.

Edit: I’m sure I’ll be the AH but if I was in your husbands shoe I’d be a bit pissed by the suicide aspect too. He’s not there to share in the dream because he chose not to be, your husband stood by you every step of the way. I get depression is a helluva drug but choosing someone who dropped out of the dream *over* (rather than *and*) someone who financially and emotionally supported you is a bit fucked up imo"
AskReddit,fcymm2g,t1_fcxcob9,1578082833.0,"Jesus Christ she should take you to court for the revenge porn you posted everywhere. You absolute piece of garbage. On behalf of her, fuck you, you psychopath."
AmItheAsshole,fctamcu,t3_eisu58,1577937399.0,"Races are being mentioned but I would not consider this racist in any way. I think you’re NTA but I also disagree with your opinion. Racism is serious and real. It causes harm to people and entire communities who are attacked simply for the way they are born. I believe that to call something like this racist dilutes the conversation around racism and makes it more difficult to work through as a society.

Edit: After reading other comments, I say YTA because, yeah, why would you post it again if you legitimately consider it racist??"
BingeEatingDisorder,fcrxz8i,t1_fcra28u,1577908158.0,"I sincerely hope you find your way, counting never worked for me either. Tea really does seem to help. Sometimes I think a lot of it is due to sugar addiction, so when it’s really bad I’ll add the tiniest dollop of honey (vegan “honey” these days) or a splash of oat milk and that will take the edge off almost immediately. I realize it’s like telling an addict to micro dose in order to get over the addiction but when the oat milk is about 120cal/cup and I’m having a cup and a half over the course of a day compared to a 1500 calorie or more binge, it definitely feels like the safer route. We are capable of having control, we just each need to find our own way and take the time to “unpack” ourselves. From my own experience, the journey to self control has brought me face to face the various versions of myself that I hate and I feel like each new meeting of seeing, accepting, and loving these versions of me has helped to peel away another barrier to my success. I just tell myself that it’s okay to be an ugly, lazy, piece of shit sometimes, which I know were supposed to say nice wonderful things to ourselves but I find great contentment in taking the pressure off and giving my worst qualities a big hug and saying I love you anyway. The moments I can genuinely love myself unconditionally (however begrudgingly) really help take the edge off. It may seem counterintuitive but I think sometimes we have to accept who we are before we can begin to change. I hope you can find a way to give the worst parts of yourself a big hug and a lot of love today, maybe that will help make today, this week, month, year a bit easier <3"
BingeEatingDisorder,fcp8vjd,t3_eic1cy,1577854414.0,So I mentioned this on a different post but thought I’d share with you too - Today I had the most success in controlling my eating than I have in weeks. I decided to make little tick marks on my wrist with a pen in order to track each time I went to the kitchen to eat when I was bored and decided not to. I felt much less powerless since I was keeping track of my “wins”. All I can think of is how many times in the previous few weeks I walked back and forth to the kitchen obsessing about food only to breakdown and feel powerless and beat myself up for it. Instead of cheering myself on for resisting the 10 times I walked in and DIDNT eat. I wonder if tracking those successes would’ve helped me gain the willpower or kept me out of the despair which led to me binging.  I’m thinking they will if today is any indication. Maybe you can try this too - Happy New You’s Eve :)

BingeEatingDisorder,fcp7yrw,t3_ei45ys,1577853507.0,"You are not alone in that struggle. As someone who just had to frantically make myself a cup of tea so I wouldn’t eat the whole refrigerator (tea is my crutch) I know exactly how you feel. Today, I tried something new. Every time I got up to get food when I was bored (not hungry, just bored) and didn’t eat something, I marked it with a pen on the inside of my wrist. I’m hoping it will help me see all the successes I have throughout the day rather than just my failures. It actually inspired me when I decided to make my tea because I wanted to put another mark down. Maybe that’s something you can try at work. Every time you want a snack or to eat but don’t, you can record it so you can see how much will power you actually do have rather than focusing on the times you don’t. I just came across this sub and really hope it will help me, my mind is racing significantly less since reading other people’s posts. Certainly helps me realize I’m not alone, I think there’s something worthwhile in that knowledge. Maybe one day we’ll find a way to break the shackles :)"
BingeEatingDisorder,fcp7ll2,t3_eic1cy,1577853141.0,"I hear ya. I hope tomorrow brings you better days, definitely rooting for you to not have anymore “because why not” days. I’m trying to leave my own behind. All my hopes and wishes for you to feel in control :)"
BingeEatingDisorder,fcp7f79,t3_ei87j0,1577852968.0,Thank you for this post - I hope you have a wonderful night! Happy NYE :)
