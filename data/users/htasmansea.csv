SuicideWatch,ffdocyh,t1_ffdgpu3,1579825162.0,Good! Put everything out on the table for the new one. I'm sure you can get through this. Let me know how it goes. You can pm me if you want.
SuicideWatch,ffcj5fz,t1_ffcgqut,1579800577.0,Does your counselor know how suicidal you are? Maybe he/she can help facilitate a discussion with your parents.
SuicideWatch,ffcgjvs,t3_esvjfr,1579798989.0,"There are ways to get rid of the pain without dying. I'm glad you didn't feel suicidal on January 9; that says you can feel better; we just need to make everyday be like that day. Feel free to vent here. There's also therapy, medications, working toward a goal. Do your parents know how you feel?"
SuicideWatch,ff66tdq,t1_ff5g35c,1579620512.0,Understood; but it will stress her out more if you hurt yourself. I would suggest scheduling a time with her and then putting it all on the table. Then she can help you get some help. Most people do feel better after high school; it's a very stressful time of life that you just need to get through.
SuicideWatch,ff3e6cv,t1_ff395ui,1579539269.0,But does she know you've been considering suicide?
SuicideWatch,ff20qcq,t3_er6z9y,1579490712.0,I doubt very much it's all in your head. You're obviously a good person for staying in there for your Mom. It sounds like the time has come to tell her what's going on with you. I'm sure she'd rather have you alive as you are than for you to no longer be around. Then hopefully she can help you get some real help with everything put out on the table. I hope you're able to talk to her.
SuicideWatch,felrh4j,t3_epu08i,1579229136.0,"Where do you live? The statutory rape statues vary by jurisdiction. In some states (assuming you're in the US), your situation would not constitute statutory rape."
SuicideWatch,felr2gu,t3_epu0e0,1579228862.0,Please don't do it. Let's instead see how we can change things for you. You say you sleep throughout the day; are you in school? Can you possibly have a talk with your parents? Don't hold back; tell them what you're thinking so they can get you some help.
SuicideWatch,fe8ov7i,t3_eo58xz,1578928741.0,"I'm assuming you're in high school since you say when school ends, it's just more school. If you can find something you might want to do as a career, then it's a lot easier to get motivated; then you can be happy about what you're going to do and look forward to it. There are tests you can take to find out what career you might enjoy; you can find these on-line or your guidance counselor can help you."
SuicideWatch,fcod3g4,t3_ei137q,1577829292.0,"People under 18 can be depressed and often are, and things actually get better for most people after 18, not worse. And no you're not annoying; I give young people tons of credit for taking stands on things that adults have tended to ignore - environment, gun violence, etc."
SuicideWatch,fc1jkzx,t1_fbzh2mn,1577320691.0,"Any chance you could try talking to your Mom further about all this? Maybe the help you had before just wasn't good enough. I'm not sure what else to suggest. I hope you're going to make it through the holidays. Just so I have an idea who I'm talking to, are you male or female? We can keep talking if you think it helps."
