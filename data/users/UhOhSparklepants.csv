I worked up quickly in the industry from tech to analyst within 6 months, but they pay never bumps over 18-19 without fighting tooth and nail for it unless you snag a lucrative organic chem position.

 Environmental service companies, at least in my 5 years of experience working for them, use and abuse the analysts because they are a dime a dozen. Everyone jumps into that straight out of college and unless you get lucky with your timing and someone high up retires you are SOL for moving up anytime soon. Maybe if you snag a job with DEQ or the state it works out, but *everyone* applies for those so competition is fierce. I once drove 250 miles 4 times for the interview process for a state lab position and ultimately didn't get the job.

Advice? Get a BS in a specific area like microbiology, biochemistry, etc. You will have an easier time finding a decent job right out of school.
