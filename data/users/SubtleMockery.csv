Grab & Stab. Drag enemies through *cloud of daggers* or *spike growth*. Drag them off cliffs or up buildings. Leap from rooftops onto their ribcage. Prey on their fear, move like an animal, *feeeel the kill*.  

Basically I saw [this character art](https://i.imgur.com/SSx5Tco.jpg) and fell in love with it.  

I keep cycling through options to try and maximize what I can do. If I go Fighter 2/Zealot Barbarian X and take Brawny I can basically achieve the same thing buuut without a lot of the mobility and the fluff is all wrong.  

I can forego Barbarian entirely and just go Fighter/Rogue and take Grappler (yes I know it's bad), but then I lose a lot of hit points and defensive options and I kind of have this whole Barbarian wanderer ""madclaw"" backstory built up with a slavic accent and everything."
