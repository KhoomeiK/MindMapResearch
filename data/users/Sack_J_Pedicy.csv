Menopause. I’m a man but, I’ve seen 3 examples in my own life and even more on the internet. 

Some people handle it fine, other people develop an entirely different personality, and not in a good way. And if this person already has a few problems, it only gets worse. 

It’s very much a case by case basis, I know, but some people just completely change into absolute werewolves. I’m sorry but I’ve seen examples and it’s scary. 

One poor man I used to go to church with... this was probably the nicest most patient guy I had ever met. Him and his wife moved into the area when I was like 10. 

As I entered my teens her personality completely changed. Everything was a problem, everything was an argument. This poor haggard man was always patient but I could tell it was getting to him. 

It took several years for her to actually recognize the problem and they found a medication that greatly stabilized her mood. She was sweet again, and actually fun to be around for the first time in years. It was like a switch was flipped on and then back off. 

Now she’s through with that business and went off the medication with no problems and she’s still sweet as can be, but that shit scared me."

My father had to gently explain how an air conditioner works and you can’t just change it by several degrees at once, or change it just for one person. 

If you change it say, from 71 to 70,  it doesn’t start pumping out 70 degree air. It makes the air as hot or as cold as possible which can end up being too much. 

And if you change it by several degrees the thing kicks into jet plane mode. 

In the winter if you turn it up too fast you turn the heat strip on, which is very power consuming and gives the air that dry burnt smell and makes your runny noses even more dry and irritated. 

We can’t freeze the other elderly people because one of you is having a hot flash, and we can’t crank it too high or else the stage area gets waaaay too hot with all the lights. 

It eventually got locked because some people would just change it without asking, and rules were made about who was allowed. 

And people would usually complain and get up to change it, y’know, during the service.

Once I got my hands on a machete I figured out I would whittle them down to look like actual blades. 

Now that I’ve gotten more creative, I use 2x4’s, salvaged wood and metal bits, electrical/gorilla tape, and nails to make some pretty cool mock weapons largely inspired by the games I play. 

At the moment I have a shed with my creations.

I have a big gun greatsword with a mock barrel and loading mechanism with a ‘trigger’ on the handle, 

A ‘chainsaw’ blade with an actual chain around a whittled 2x4 partially hidden to look like it actually loops around, and some metal bits to look like a motor. 

A crossbow with fang looking bayonets and the leftover chain as the string, 

A more monster hunter inspired longsword with a split log on the end and spikes near the hilt. 

I’m currently in the process of making a mock gunlance from monster hunter using a piece of a metal bed frame, two barrels, and a vacuum motor to imitate the big revolver style cartridge. I’m using the tubes and a jar to imply that it uses the ‘thunderbugs’ in the game as a firing mechanism. It’s just been extra cold and rainy so I’m waiting on better weather. 

I’m also making a greatsword from a wooden headboard I got my hands on. 

I don’t paint anything so they’re still just wood and metal and whatever other bits I can get my hand on, I just whittle down parts to roughly resemble what I want their fictional purpose to be.
