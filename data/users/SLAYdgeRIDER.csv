Adobe's Behance or Portfolio is an option with the CC subscription.

There are several photography-based websites like 500px and ViewBug wherein you can upload your photos and share them, sell them, get them printed. They can serve as your online photography profile.

If you have $0 to spend, your Instagram will serve as a portfolio. You can link it to your resume and if they ask for full pictures (since Instagram crops), you can show that to anyone on your laptop or through email."

Good. Both your sister and your brother-in-law need therapy. The way the kid handled the situation was astounding, something even I couldn't have fathomed if that was me in the situation.

And finally, 

> I feel like an asshole 

No, you're NTA. You gave the kid time and space to be a step ahead of their ""*psycho parents*"" if I can call them that. If you didn't say that to the kid, that kid would have had a hell of a mental breakdown and THAT would have made you an A-hole. Fortunately, you made the correct people go to therapy.

unpopularopinion,fcn3d6y,t1_fcn1bar,1577802135.0,"I still think the touch screen serves a purpose. Even without a touch screen, you're not supposed to fiddle with the knobs all the time, you have to set them and change them once a while.

And to answer your question, well, even in vehicles with touch screens, there are physical buttons available on the steering wheel which you can control your music, attend calls, turn on indicators, wipers, etc with.

Cars have been the same for decades and a little bit of change can trigger a lot of discomforts, something super evident in this very thread. But that is the future.

And if you're also wondering whether the touch screens can be ""distracting"", then you should know that those car companies are making screens super minimal so as to not attract your attention while simultaneously giving you all the relevant info that you need.
