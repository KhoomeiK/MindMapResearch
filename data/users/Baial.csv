CurseofStrahd,fe37kff,t3_enor68,1578846710.0,I switched accents for each town because I wanted each one to feel like it is in it's own bubble. Though I gave all the nobles a slavic accent.

Radiology,fds4083,t3_emx0tn,1578693919.0,"So, I don't know the rules around non medical x-ray machines. As others have said using x-rays on people is super illegal. I don't know the legality of someone just using one on their cellphone... however, like others have said this seems like a very bad idea unless you can get a radiation safety physicist to take a look at it.

1) X-ray film develops very similarly to normal film. You need a dark room and all the different chemical baths.

2)I forget the exposure requirements for different speeds of film, but there's probably a chart out there.

3) The closer the object is to the receptor and further away from the source, the less scatter will be in the images. Also, the steeper the angle of the cathode, I believe the more concentrated the beam will be. If you want to know how to focus x-rays, this isn't a project for you.

4) I'm pretty sure an intensifier sheet, is a sheet with certain elements on it that glow when  hit by an x-ray. You can use a lot fewer x-rays to get a usable image.

I am very much recommending you don't do this, because you don't seem to appreciate what you're doing."
