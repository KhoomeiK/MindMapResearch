Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fenmxud,t1_fenly43,1579288061.0,Instead of smoking two or three on my way home from work I end up waiting until I’m home to smoke. Much better and safer than smoking while driving.

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,femza2f,t3_ep1d75,1579273395.0,I would say that my worst habit is smoking. I have begun to associate smoking with bathroom breaks at work and it’s started to become a problem. I now have to ask myself if I just need to pee or if I really want a cigarette. It’s usually the former.

I feel like you can make real friends in places like this. My suggestion to you is to take up a new hobby or just get more involved in one you already like. I’m sure a lot of people are into the same things you are, try attending get-togethers or other events. It won’t be easy, but you’ll eventually get used to the social interaction."

Reddit is the only *social* media I really use, if you could even call it that. I’m trying to substitute screen time with real human interaction, but sometimes I just get curious about what some people on reddit are into."
