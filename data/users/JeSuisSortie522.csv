Serverlife,ff6w07a,t3_enbvcn,1579636031.0,"We have one semi-regular where I work who just doesn't even try. I've walked over to find her 2-3 year old body surfing on the table, screaming and trying to get her mom's attention, and we've had to walk over and stop her when the toddler got up from the table, found our standing sign, and started yanking on it and swinging around it and almost breaking it. The mom couldn't be bothered to stop chatting with her friend.

We also had two other moms so busy chatting, they didn't notice until someone else loudly alerted us that their 5 year olds had just snuck outside into the parking lot where we get a LOT of fast cars."
creepyPMs,ff5wibr,t3_erhbyu,1579612600.0,"I cannot really speak on autism, but I would definitely agree with all the other comments I've seen in saying that this is still creep behavior. Not getting explicit consent from you before initiating any kind of flirtatious behavior, mentioning that his girlfriend is clearly monogamous and would not be comfortable with you talking, and refusing to tell her anything about you because he knows it wouldn't be allowed are all HUGE red flags. Not to mention the kind of fake dom behavior he's portraying. Anyone who immediately starts trying to act ""dominant"" (calling you pet names; talking about what they like, such as you ""doing what you're told,"" having to put their ""dominance"" on display and constantly bring it up), but doesn't even bother to ask what your goals are from this relationship, what your boundaries are, what you're comfortable and uncomfortable with, is not a good person. That is a predator who is trying to masquerade as a ""Dom."""

beauty,feeu9fo,t3_eolpbl,1579041341.0,"Often times, the conditioner that comes with hair dye is marketed as a hair mask, which is essentially just a slightly stronger conditioner that you're supposed to leave in for like 10 minutes. If you find that your conditioner isn't doing enough for you, I would recommend leaving it in longer first. If that doesn't work, try looking for things marketed as hair *masks* instead of conditioners. I got a sample of Perfect Repair Treatment Masque from NatureLab Tokyo that I've been loving, but I also love the brand Ion at Sally's, and I feel very certain they sell a bottle of either a hair mask or an ""after-color treatment,"" which should net you the same results."

UnconventionalMakeup,fedctx3,t3_eog8im,1579007865.0,"Honestly, I never would have known there was a ""mistake"" had you not said so. This looks so expertly executed. Every aspect is so effortlessly polished and beautifully intentional. I love this more than I can say.

I have such a bad habit of just wiping everything off if I mess up. This does not only inspire artistically; it inspires the process as well. This says that embracing your perceived mistakes sometimes turns out even more beautiful than your original plan.

beauty,fedc3zy,t1_fecowym,1579007221.0,"They will often go away on their own, but if they don't, a derm should be able to remove them for you safely. Removing them on your own can be painful and potentially dangerous, so I'd say ask a doctor about them if they persist."
beauty,fec9pnz,t1_febuawr,1578969160.0,"I feel it worth noting that it is possible to form milia if too much product is applied. Usually it happens more when a face moisturizer is used on the thin and delicate eye skin, but it can technically happen sometimes if too much eye cream/moisturizer is used. Just thought it would be good to mention"
