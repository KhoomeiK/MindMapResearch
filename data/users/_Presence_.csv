Or is it a self sustaining lie, built into the fabric of the organization and perpetuated generation by generation? However, Hinkley’s linguistic tap dance in this interview is a sharp revealer that even the prophet isn’t above lying to prevent the public from knowing the unsavoury bits of doctrine once taught. People will do mental gymnastics to square a round peg by saying things like milk before meat, or pearls before swine.

The consciousness would be neither the code or the hardware. It would necessarily have to be both, since code without a processor cannot be run nor manipulated. 

However, an artificial intelligence could, in principle, be created without code in the traditional sense we think of today. If we were to create an all hardware brain simulator, where instead of code processed by a CPU, the code was physically imprinted in the hardware connections. But instead of carbon based cells forming the structure, the artificial brain was made from silicon or some other substrate we have yet to create. Such an artificial brain would also have to all the tasks ours does, but with other materials.

Though in principle, I believe it is a phenomenon we might be able to understand and create a thorough model of given sufficient advancements in other fields of study.

My personal belief, informed by my lay understanding of consciousness and the physical properties of the brain, is it’s an emergent property of the brain given sufficient neural connection, organization and stimuli/sensory integration.

mormon,ffpx057,t1_ffpvwe3,1580109071.0,"these questions you’re posing have compelling (in my opinion) arguments that completely negate the concept of a soul. While it’s been a few years, from what I recall, most twin studies converge on around 50% of “who we are” is primarily influenced by our genes and the other 50% our environment. Nothing left for an ethereal spirit. Unless you want to assign the soul to our genes, but then twins would be the same soul. 

The topic of free will is incredibly fascinating to me. Sam Harris articulates, in my opinion, the most cogent and compelling argument against the idea of free will. His writings on the subject are a must read if you’re interested in exploring the notion of free will.
