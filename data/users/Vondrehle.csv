Worked on a foreclosure owned by two real estate agents who knew exactly how to game the system. They had six foster kids, all with medical issues. They got the place (close to 3/4 million, 5,000 sq ft, 8 bedroom 12 bath in a gated community with a golf course) for nothing down, and never made a single payment. Because of the sick children, they couldn't be evicted, and none of the utilities or services could be shut off. They lived there for two and a half years and did over $100K worth of damage to a new house, largely because no one was supervising the six kids and their dozens of friends."

My boss could easily find someone better than me for higher wages, or cheaper than me with lower job performance. His customers hired him on exactly the same principal.

Also, you will notice the ""burnout"" only seem to affect some employees and not others. I managed a pizzeria 72 hours a week for years, I had delivery drivers than couldn't handle 30. Companies are rarely understaffed and never do so intentionally. Overtime laws alone screw people out of the hours they want, and even if the laws didn't exist, three 40 hour employees cost the same as two 60 hour a week employees, but one calling out sick means you lost 1/3 instead of 1/2, and overworked employees are less efficient and their job satisfaction is lower."

They pay six times as much money to the federal government as they receive, are the third highest performing state in the nation, enjoy a very high wage to cost of living ratio, and because of their tax policy (which is to say they don't take a months pay a year from workers like most states do) four of the ten fastest growing cities in the country are in Texas. 

If anything, being a part of the US is only slowing them down."
IsItBullshit,fdfi00x,t1_fdf0ztq,1578362151.0,"Oil hasn't been major in decades, never will be. They are too close to other producers who have dramatically lower operational costs. It's the largest export in terms of raw dollar amount, but the profit is weak compared to other industries.

Texas has a massive stake in the agricultural, technological, medical, and professional sectors. Their location makes them a very important hub between North and South America, and between high wages, low taxes (no state income tax at all) and low cost of living, it is a very attractive place for commerce and professionals alike. Because of this, their entertainment, tourism, and hospitality sectors are thriving. 

As for drug cartels, I don't see what threat they pose. Texas is the tenth largest economy in the world, wealthier than Russia, South Korea or Australia. 

While their state (only) militia is volunteer and designed for emergency and rescue operations, it has a force of 21,000 troops and over 1,000 planes including MQ-9 Reaper drones, which have a top speed of 300 mph, a 1,000 mile range, 50,000 foot cruising altitude, hellfire missiles and laser guided bombs. It can read a license plate from two miles away.

The US is technically the worlds only superpower, and could theoretically isolate itself from the world, but it would come at a massive cost to the quality of life, even if it were sustainable. 

If you're willing to go hunter gatherer, most states are self sustainable. Except New Jersey. Once the pomade runs out half of the state will wither like grapes and melt into the plastic dustcovers on their couches."

If you ever watched the movie Trainspotting, you remember the disturbing baby crawling on the ceiling scene more than any other part, and they recreated it in this cartoon knowing most of their preteen viewers wouldn't get the reference.

When dreams begin it's even stranger. You slam directly from unconsciousness to being completely engulfed in the dream instantly but in your hypnotic state completely ignore the change.

Lady was furious her new truck cost almost twice as much to change, and figured we were ripping her off because she has a new vehicle. No, her truck did in fact use twice as much oil.

She pulls into a parking lot and is immediately hit by a car that was trying to drive through one parking lot into the other. Guys insurance company told her, by law, she had to stop as soon as she got in the parking lot and look for oncoming traffic. 

She gets new glasses. Six months later, they tell her the prescription changed and she needs new ones. Six months later, it has changed again - to the original prescription.

Another time the guy tells me my ball joint is loose and it spins when he tightens it. I tell him he needs to hold it in place with a ball joint puller. He looks at me in confusion. Picklefork? Still has no idea what I'm taking about and presumably doesn't own one. So I held the top with vice grips so he could drive the nut down.

I point out 6 is never a multiple of 4 and he gives me the well-I-didn't-engineer-the-car routines. 

Turned out to be a snapped timing belt, which they only figured out after they replaced the ignition, so they figured they'd get a two for one deal out of me."

The markups are ridiculous. We used the same treatments you'd get at an auto parts store, spend one minute pouring them in, and charge $25 for the service. 

Bastard was so cheap he didn't use washer fluid, just water. I told him it would crack the whole system if it froze, but we lived in Phoenix so screw them if they ever went North.
