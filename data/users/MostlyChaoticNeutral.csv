If you give any ground from the start it'll be seen as some sort of ""admitting fault,"" simply because OP is the male in the relationship and it's all downhill from there. Give her two hours to pack her clothes and toiletries, not any expensive gifts or electronics you've paid for, and have her parents pick her up. Keep the nanny because you're going to be busy getting everything in order to cut her out of your life, and it'll show that you're a parent who is fully capable of providing for child care."

AskWomen,fc2sn56,t1_fc2gxur,1577372868.0,"I don't disagree with a doctor having concerns about performing an elective hysterectomy on anyone just because of the health concerns involved. It can turn out to cause no problems, but it's not exactly a risk free procedure and it's going to impact a person for the rest of their life. Tubal litigation though is pretty routine."
AskWomen,fc1wvhk,t3_efnsd2,1577332197.0,"A friend from my Uni days hates kids. Burning fire of a thousand suns hates kids. The day she turned 18 she started trying to find a doctor who would perform an elective hysterectomy on her. She made power points, had a psychologist evaluate her and provide a letter attesting to her soundness of mind, and had a list of her plans for self-sterilization in the event she couldn't find a doctor who would respect her autonomy enough to perform an elective surgery on her. She kept meticulous records of each time she went to talk to a doctor face to face and phone calls. The doctors she felt were more likely to give got weekly phone calls. It took five years and dozens of doctors across two countries before she browbeat one enough to get him to ""allow her"" to have an elective tubal litigation. The doctor thinks he scored a major victory in talking her down from a full hysterectomy to a tubal ligation. Joke's on him, she wanted the tubal ligation from the start."
