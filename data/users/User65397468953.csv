If you look at the public education in the US, we spend more per child than any other country in the world. And we still struggle heavily with....

1.). Low paid teachers

2.). The quality of the education students get

All of the top high schools in my state are either magnet schools that only have select the very top students or are private schools.

Why are we confident that public healthcare will be better than public education, and if we have a way to ensure better public systems... Why haven't we done it to fix public education?"
UpliftingNews,ffo3zri,t1_ffku2jl,1580073889.0,"I'm sorry; but that is a giant, giant leap....

The guy installed a special drawer which allowed someone to drop off a baby without any direct human interaction.  It was installed at a staffed fire station.... Where the existing laws permit anyone to drop off a baby under 30 days, anonymously/confidentially.

There is absolutely no way to know what would have happened to this baby without the box being installed.  First, there are other baby boxes like it in Indiana.... the baby might have simply been dropped somewhere else.  Whoever dropped the baby off might have just walked inside and handed the baby to someone.

Years ago, I had to send a check to pay bills; now I do it online.  Without the intent, I wouldn't stop paying my bills, I would just pay them differently.  If I were dropping off my baby, and the place had a box,I would use it....but if it didn't, I wouldn't just toss the baby in a dumpster and drive off.... I'd drop the baby off through the front door.

Certainly, there is a greater than zero probability that the baby would have died; but it is statistically far more likely the baby would have lived with or without it.

And once we start talking about low probability options... These boxes make certain really, really bad things easier too.  Maybe the woman who gave birth wanted the baby, but her physically abusive and controlling boyfriend/father of the baby didn't want to deal with it?  A completely anonymous transaction provides no opportunity to assess the condition of those leaving the baby... And make it easier for that guy to force a vulnerable person into making the drop.

So I mean... Maybe he saved the baby, maybe he helped a deadbeat, abusive father, force a woman to abandon her baby because he didn't want anything to cut into his drinking time?"
Conservative,ffkrdzt,t1_ffizmef,1580027549.0,"That's probably the worst outlook I can imagine.  No offense intended.  I'm guessing you actually understand the difference and aren't looking for a serious answer, but just in case you are sincere....

The difference is in the degree and number of families that you will burden people already supporting their own families with.

I've paid taxes everywhere I've lived; but there was such a large difference between my time in the EU where I paid 23% VAT and was in the 51% income tax bracket... Literally, if I worked hard and got a bonus at my job, 51% of that would go to the government. 

The lifestyle I could afford, while working the same type of job, in the EU was so much below what I can currently afford in the US.  It was the primary reason I left and returned to the US.

If you want to buy a new TV for $1,000, do you see the difference in paying $1,039 like you would in Colorado city... Or paying $1,230 like you would if you lived in a place with a 23% VAT?

Then imagine that sort of difference on everything.  Every time you get paid.... Getting less money.  Every time you go shopping, paying more for it in taxes.

I used to live in Colorado and I paid property taxes.  When I lived, today, for a nice $300k house, you would pay $1,500 per year in property tax.  I also used to live in Illinois.  Get a house in my old neighborhood for $300k and it is $6,000 per year in property tax.

It's not enough to say, ""oh well... They all have taxes, I guess it doesn't matter""

These are life altering amounts of money.  And believe me, I didn't personally get anything better for my $6k than I did for my $1.5k

You take that extra $4.5k, per year, when you are planning on owning a house for forty years of your life.... Invest it each year and average a 7% return... That is $500,000 more you would have in your retirement.  That's why this stuff matters.

That's literally also why I left a country where I was happy, gainfully employed, paying taxes, contributing to society, not breaking laws, raising children.  People really, really care about this stuff.

I know the goal is to ""lift everyone up"" but taxes aren't magic.  Done without a lot of care and consideration, we get something worse.

Finally.... Let's talk about the two biggest messes I see in the US, economically....

Student loans

Health Care

Do you know what these both have in common?  The current problems we have exist, primarily, because of politicians passing laws.  

Federally backed student loans was a really well intentioned thing... Let everyone go to college, even if they aren't rich.  The obvious side effect is that students so caring about the cost of tuition... They just borrow more money.  Repayment is a lifetime away!  Schools keep raising tuition, far faster than inflation, but students have no trouble paying.  Because of Federally backed student loans.  And the increasing tuition made it so almost nobody can go at all, without loans.

Healthcare got screwed when the US government restricted wage increases during WW2 and have tax breaks to employer healthcare plans.  Companies ordered that because they couldn't give raises.  Exact same thing happened...

When you have insurance you don't care what the doctor or hospital charges.  You care about what you pay.   That depends on your insurance, which depends on your job.  More and more people got these plans and medical professionals start raising process... And nobody seems to mind.  Soon, nobody can afford healthcare without insurance... And insurance is too expensive to afford without a company subsidizing it.  And even as I type this, my wife and I did a hospital tour this weekend and didn't even think about the price for anything.... Because we will just pay the out of pocket maximum.

And before you say, ""public will be better/cheaper... Just because...""

Remember that the US already spends more per capital in public education than any other country, but our high school students under perform compared to the rest of the world.  And that's public.

So, the amount of taxes matter a lot.  Government programs that seem like obvious great things can cause unfathomable problems in 50+ years, and throwing tax dollars at problems, like education, had already been shown not to work."

I don't know if she was lying?  Maybe she just meant the hospital sent her a bill, but the doctor would demand a copay... And she just didn't pay the bills?  Or maybe there was some program for free ambulance rides and treatment?

Cars really do cost more to maintain.  For almost all cars, after 10 or 12 years, they are no longer fit for use.  Virtually all of a cars value is in its ability to be a car.  A normal 10 year old car is worth very little as spare parts and/or raw materials.

Houses are very different.  The useful lifespan of a house is...hundreds...of years.  People do consider the lifespan of individual pieces of the house and that is reflected in the value of the home.  

In many locations, the value of the house just a percentage of the value of the property.  Where I live, it is common for wealthy people to buy houses, bulldoze then, and build fancy houses on top.  So much of the value is the land, and the location that the land is on.

Economics,ffhg85i,t1_fffyzqd,1579933910.0,"It's a manifestation of having such a wide disparity between people's financial situations.

It is very easy to open a bank account in the US.  You need a government issued ID.  Some banks require additional information like your birthday or social security number.  There are tons of places that offer free types of banking.

You can open an account online, by phone, or in person.

Easy.

And for most people living in the US, this is a total non-issue.  The problem is the extreme end of people that can't make this work.  Imagine a room with 1000 people.  Picture the one with the worst upbringing or lowest IQ or greatest physical disability.  Then remember there are 8.6 million people in NYC.

Illegals/undocumented workers might not be able to get banks.  Immigration is a tricky topic in the US and a lot of people support laws that make life easier for people in this situation.  This is one such example.

Really poor people too.  Nice banks don't open branches in the ghetto.  Poor people don't want to take a bunch of buses to get to a bank to open an account, and then take those same buses to deposit money each week.  Online accounts are great, but you can't deposit physical cash easily.

Along with that 'free' accounts never are.  At least not in the US.  If you have money, you give the bank a minimum amount and your account is free.  The bank uses your money to make themselves money.  They are happy.  Poor people can't do that.  Banks that Target poor people make money by charging fees.  Upfront fees won't work - poor people would say no.  The fees get hidden.  Overdraft fees or they will require N transactions per month, but catch you by using calendar month instead of 30 days or something.  They will also apply transactions in the way that screws you the most.  If I have $20 in my account and deposit $100 today and you cash a check I wrote you for $80... They will apply the check first, so I am at -$60 then charge me an overdraft fee of $30... Instead of $40 the bank says I have $10.  Only I don't know it, so the next day I try to spend $20 and well, you get the idea.  And ATM fees ... I have a good bank so I get reimbursed ATM fees.  When I go to an ATM, rarely, I take out my daily limit, because why not.  I get $500 and I pay $0.  I'm luck.

If money was tight and I only had $60 I might take out $40 and have to pay $3.00 to get the money.  That's a crazy high percent.

HSBC has a basic checking account that costs only $1 per month.  But it has a $2.50 for ATMs that aren't HSBC (plus whatever that atm charges you), and $35 for insufficient funds.

You can get a studio apartment for $500 and you only pay electric.  That is doable on minimum wage.

The thing is, it is really hard to find a minimum wage job in Rockford.  No experience janitor job posting, right now, starts at $8.25.  Apparently Wendy's in Rockford starts at $9.25.  I worked at McDonald's for a short time in college and u started above minimum wage and they had scheduled raises.

Overall I think the company needed to be fifty percent Irish, but a lot of teams were like mine.

We did get to travel around a bit and it's a really pretty country.  Also, I personally loved the weather.  Very very rarely too cold, snowed about three times in the five years.  It did rain a lot, but it was light rain, more like a mist.

I'm pretty boring, but the few times we went out we had good times.

My parents in particular don't get it.  They think my brother is poor because he spends too much on coffee.  They think I'm a success because I 'take risk'.

 I also think there is a trend for people to increase the bar for what they consider rich as they make more and more.  Someone with two million dollars might think billionaires are rich, but not them.  Maybe I'm falling into that trap.

At the same time, I was worried that if I said I was rich, people would call me out because I'm not 'rich enough'.

My oldest kid takes swimming lessons.  It's $110 per month...or they ran a promotion for $999 per year, and they give you some extra crap if you pay the $999.  For me, that is a no brainier.... $999 is much cheaper than $1,320.  For someone who struggles to pay for their kid to swim, $999 isn't an option.  But, effectively, it means people with money get a large discount.  And these discounts are everywhere.

Put money down on your house... No PMI.  You save a lot.  Or even just looking for jobs.  I have family members who lost a job and needed money, so they felt they had to take the first job they could find.  And they weren't wrong, they had bills they couldn't pay.  Taking a crappy job hurts your career.  On the extreme other end, a friend of mine from college went back for a masters degree and spent 9 months after graduation looking for a job.  He turned down a lot of offers, waiting for a really really good one.  And he eventually accepted and it worked out really well for him.

When I was 28 I moved overseas and started applying for jobs.  Same deal.  It wasn't brave of me.  If I didn't find a job, I'd move back and consider it a vacation.  No problem.  I did get a job and I lived there for nearly five years.  It wasn't brave.  I risked nothing.

My wife and I have kids with one more in the way.  I make good money and have benefits.  She is very likely to start her own business after this baby comes.  She just won't go back to her job.

It's not scary or brave.  We have the money to get it started and even if she makes $0 for the next N years, it won't impact our lifestyle at all.  We might take fewer vacations or something, and save a little less for retirement.  There is no real risk.

I used to work at a proprietary trading firm as a lowly software developer.  They were super paranoid about any potential conflict of interest.  The operations staff and the traders had access to obscene, obscene, amounts of money.  

This company was privately owned.  All of the money being used was literally the money of the really rich partners.

If you were hiring someone and trusting them to make choices, every trading day, with millions of your personal money... it kind of makes sense to look into things.  

Background checks and credit checks were required.  If you were in debt up to your eyeballs, the concern was that you would be tempted to try and cheat then.  It would also cause them to question your financial management abilities.

Also, while this wasn't true for me; a lot of these businesses used other people's money to invest.  So they have clients coming in with hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest.    Image is really important.  I know it shouldn't matter, but I wouldn't hire a financial advisor who was living in a rusted out, visibly damaged vehicle.  A solid, conservative, old car... That's a different story.  

To be clear, all of the jobs in talking about were well paid jobs.  This isn't:

> We pay you $10 an hour and trust you with the cash register - get a BMW

It was more like...

> We pay you $100k plus bonus and commission and trust you with millions, and you are driving a car with a cracked windshield, rust, and a door that doesn't match... What is going on?

As a developer, I had access to information that I could have used to try and make a buck...but the traders really did have dozens of  different ways they could have padded their own pockets.  We had software meant to catch some suspicious things, but really, if you wanted to, you could find a way and probably get away with it for a while.  Ops, especially the higher up ops had crazy levels of control over insane amounts of money.  They had protections in place, but trust was key.

Still, I don't know the details here, so I'm not saying anything about this one in particular.  And, maybe I'm biased, but my experience was very positive.

I believe that Bernie believes in his policies.  I believe he will fight for them.  I also believe he will be uncompromising in his pursuit of those policies.

Without the support of a lot of people, he can't do the things he had promised.  And this isn't Bernie specific, I think it applies to a lot of presidential promises.  Warren says the president can forgive student loans, a lot of legal types disagree.  Most of the other things, it seems, the president cannot just *do*.

Mortgages are considerably cheaper and houses are considerably larger.  Prices *should* reflect that.  Most people aren't paying cash for a house, now or then.  The mortgage interest rate has a huge impact.  At 9%, if I have $1,000 to spend each month, I can get a 128k loan.   At 4% I can get a 194k loan.

Same mortgage payment.

House prices reflect what people are willing and able to pay.  Lower interest means increased prices.  What almost everyone cares about is what they have to pay each month.

Insurance companies aren't magic.  They collect premiums and pay out claims.  Banks being robbed means increased costs for everyone who wants insurance.  When someone commits insurance fraud, it is the exact same thing.  They are hurting everyone who uses insurance.

Being involved in a bank robbery is very traumatic for employees and customers.  It can have lasting emotional repercussions.

Police will investigate.  This is resources taken from other activities, funded by tax payers.

unpopularopinion,fezqkf1,t3_eqp3bo,1579460396.0,"Your argument is faulty. 

First problem is that you have an implicit assumption that nothing is worse than death.  We know this to be false because people actively wish for death in certain situations.  People will even kill themselves, proving their desire to be dead.

Second problem is that your example treats all life as equally valuable.  This is highly debatable and virtually every single legal system in the planet disagrees with it.  The actions you take can devalue your life.  For places with the death penalty, it means that by doing something bad enough, your life becomes worthless.  Legally speaking.  The guy who kills a murderer on death row isn't, by definition, committing murder. 

Our society, for better or worse, values life differently.  We value the young more than the old.  We consider crimes against the weakest members of society to be particularly heinous.  A teen going around sucker punching ripped dudes at the gym is viewed differently than a teen sucker punching the elderly or children.

We value the innocent more than we value the guilty.

Ask 100 parents if they would rather get stabbed and require stitches, or if they would rather their child get stabbed and require stitches.  They will value the safety of their child more highly than their own safety."

Around here, the new trending criminal activity, is a car full of human waste will drive by around 3am.

They just go quick, even if you hear or see them, they can run back to the car faster than you can do anything.

GetMotivated,few5tkg,t3_eqhr0b,1579405809.0,"This seems pretty dismissive, to be honest.  Like, I have mad respect for all the doctors out there... But saying you will be 29 anyway misses the point.

A lot of people aren't able to go to med school, for various reasons.  I know I wasn't mature enough or intelligent enough to handle the course load.  I would not have gotten into med school.

Attempting to go to med school and failing is a big risk, financially.  

For a lot of people school is mentally taxing.  Saying you will be in school until 29, as a 17 year old or 19 or whatever might just be someone's way of saying, ""I can't physically/mentally take N more years of school"".

And again, starting down that path without being able to finish can be financial suicide.

Some people have other plans that don't fit with med school.

Depending on the person, their skills, they might be saying they could be something just as good at 29, only with less schooling.  Obviously, doctors make good money, but there are other jobs where people make more than doctors, certainly more than GPs anyway.  

It might also be their way of saying that they don't know what they want to do at 29.  It that they are uncertain of what the medical field will look like when they are 29.  I never could have been a doctor, but I would be nervous about planning to become one right now.  A lot of people seem focused on getting universal healthcare and nobody knows what kind of impact that will have should it happen.

And then other people quote it, as a 'murder' when, in fact, all the doctor did was commit a common logical fallacy.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority

That doesn't mean the doctor is wrong; but it encourages other people to emulate this thinking.  That whoever is more qualified is right.  And this has caused a lot of problems for everyone.  The doctor's argument is the very poorest of arguments."
