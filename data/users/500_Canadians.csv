After the hurricane, they became very accustomed to driving with no traffic lights. So if you come to an intersection and there are no cars, you are free to go. The cops have better things to do.

So when you first get there it seems like they just drive crazy and lawless, but soon you realize they are at the same time very polite. If you want to turn in or out, they are remarkably accommodating.  In fact, being polite is expected, just as is not stopping at red lights when there is no reason to.
