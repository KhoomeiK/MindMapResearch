Geography is some low hanging fruit on the list of those things, but you can also include things like world history, american history, american wars and which ones they didnt win. I'm not sure if the american education system is to blame for this or if it's a cultural preference towards ignorance about world events, but I feel like the USA would be much better served by a more educated population.

relationship_advice,ff8bmej,t3_erzvnf,1579672006.0,"So I've got an interesting perspective on this as a tattoo artist. First of all before I even address how crazy what your gf did i should address the tattoo itself. It takes a special kind of shit head artist to agree to something like that. I wont even tattoo somebody's wife/husband name on them, let alone a bit ass portrait. I would have a serious discussion with them about how terrible of an idea that is as well. I would hope that at the very least the artist had this discussion with her, but judging by her reaction I sorta doubt that happened. But now onto her crazy ass choice. I'm sure you realize how insane and irresponsible this was. If my wife did this or any of my family did this I would tell them how terrible of an idea it was. Fortunately my wife knows my position on getting the names of significant others tattooed let alone faces and agrees on it. So you need to decide if this is the sort of person you want to be with, because if it was me the answer would be a hell no."
