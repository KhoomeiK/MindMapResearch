facepalm,fem17rc,t1_fekxqyf,1579236456.0,"We use AC, and typically people keep it around 76 where I live. I would love to be able to afford colder haha. The weather here is usually around 80-110 year round though, so that would cost a fortune."
facepalm,feke7sm,t1_fek21od,1579198197.0,Where can I purchase some of that  68 °F room temperature? Here typical room temperature is 76.
facepalm,fekdqp4,t3_epha4j,1579197910.0,I try and use Celsius and the metric system when I can to help myself learn it but its really hard when you are surrounded by Fahrenheit and inches and pounds.
AceAttorney,fei5sax,t3_e25pk7,1579130907.0,"I just finished it wand was googling reddit posts about it to let my anger and stress out, so sorry for the necro, but it was full of plot holes and so so so bad.

* Machi couldn't have shot the gun.
* The blind twists are stupid and is jumped to conclusion.
* Appolo leaping to the conclusion that there are two Lamiroir's is stupid as well. It doesn't make sense. If anything the brooch not being on the second Lamiroir is proof its the same one since she dropped it????????
* The ""window"" being the vent was dumb.
* Phoenix jumping in last minute to give you the burn fragments is so fucking Deus ex Machina.
* I still have no idea why the guy was actually killed since the coocoon was destroyed by the fire... so there was no proof any smuggling happened?????????
* TBH THE COOCOON SHIT WAS DUMB IN GENERAL REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
* IDK there was morethat annoyed me but I am just ???????????? It was so bad, holy shit.

If the case after it isn't good I am going to scream that I wasted my time pushing through that garbage. Please go back to making sense and being clever and good."
BeautyGuruChatter,febseay,t1_febgal0,1578962172.0,"Because most of the world is not open and accepting and they don't think Trans people deserve to live. I don't think their is a logical reason, it just isn't ""normal"" or ""right"" or ""what god wanted."" etc. Humans are bigoted assholes. Shes a successful beauty guru and it's 2020 so exposing her wouldn't jeopardize her in any way, but from the blackmailers perspective they knew it had the possibly to ""ruin"" her because being exposed as trans has ruined, and even gotten trans people killed in the past."
discordapp,feauol3,t1_fe5vx8t,1578952333.0,"I was looking through my account and noticed that I can't delete a payment method for an active subscription to nitro, which makes sense, but that tab includes my home address and email. Could you guys maybe look into a way to require a password to look at the billing tab?"
CitiesSkylines,fdvrtg3,t1_fdse22c,1578750817.0,"Honestly you seemed like the dick. It clearly does not work for me, as I said, or I would not be making a post asking for help changing the locations of my saves.  If you don't have helpful advice maybe don't come into  a post that is asking or help. I really don't know what my response was supposed to be to you telling me it works for you... like congrats dude, but not my experience."
CitiesSkylines,fdvq8iz,t1_fdspcms,1578750225.0,"I just woke up so this looks a tad confusing, but I will dive into it later and see if I can get something to work. Thanks!"

CitiesSkylines,fdrv6nc,t1_fdr7885,1578690296.0,"New HDD and reformatting, etc. My C drive isn't safe since I change it around a lot."

anime,fcxauxp,t1_fckzaq0,1578057724.0,"I actually prefer the dub, and I hate  dubs. I think the flat delivery and awkward voice acting make it all the funnier tbh."
discordapp,fce3ys1,t1_fcczyly,1577616696.0,No. I have the ATH-M40X wired headphones and a AT2020USB+ mic. I also don't think my PC has a Bluetooth adapter in it even.
