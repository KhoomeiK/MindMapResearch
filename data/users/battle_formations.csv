I believe that depleted reactor cores are classified as national assets that are “self-protecting.”  They don’t technically need to be guarded because, well, you will die if you try to get it.

The good news is that this is a land-based reactor.  You can shut it down at anytime if that is the safest course of action.  On a submarine, that reactor provides propulsion so, without it, you die ;)"

I meant that once the ballast tanks are full (along with the people space), there is no hope of positive buoyancy.  I was stationed aboard a submarine, we filled our ballast tanks on purpose.  I’m not intimately familiar with surface ships but the ballasting design/purpose is similar :)"
SweatyPalms,fe1z56j,t3_enmv6q,1578832602.0,"A nuclear meltdown is pretty unrealistic.  Civilian plants have several safety systems to prevent this.  Generally, as long as the core stays covered with water, the fuel will remain intact.  (Chernobyl used a positive temperature coefficient of reactivity so they doomed themselves by design.)  There are many other systems that could malfunction that do not directly affect the safety of the core.

Unfortunately, to make that decision sustainable, it often comes with solitude.  Drinking, sadly, seems to be something you’re expected to do and those who abstain are shunned.  Though, the ones that won’t accept you for your choice will never admit that.

I, like some others, greatly enjoy my solitude.  I don’t find that I require human interaction to feel fulfilled.   Though, I’ve always kind of been that way.

As stated above, I’d recommend volunteering.  Volunteering with animals is very fulfilling.  You get to interact with other humans and also provide attention and love for other living creatures.

Also, it may seem weird, but I’ve recently gotten into houseplants.  There’s a lot more to it than just buying a plant and setting it on your table.  There’s a lot to learn and a lot to do and it can be relatively inexpensive.  It provides me a sense of fulfillment to care for other living things, if that makes sense.

That’s just my two cents.  Either way, great job and keep it up and remember that there are many, many people out there wrestling with their demons.  Stay on top of yours."
