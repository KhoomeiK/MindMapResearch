She spoke with an American accent and when we were listening to people going around the room as to why they can't server as a juror, we were joking about our reasons for why we can't.


She jokes that because I have a British accent I probably won't be picked and I joked that if I was born in non English country I would try to say my English comprehension was awful. She tells me she was born in Vietnam, I go ""oh perfect, you can put on a fake accent and say no English"" she goes ""yeah I wish I could, but I can't do the accent!"".


Long story short, we both got selected to be a juror out of 50 people lol."
