halsey,ff9pebk,t3_esf6lk,1579717957.0,I think it’s a note to her bisexuality. Cuz the next line is “and i have never felt the difference” meaning that both boys and girls are love to her. She hasn’t felt what non bisexuals feel towards a sex/gender they aren’t attracted to.
halsey,ff7qwvm,t3_ermd2p,1579656180.0,Did you have to stop it right before the chorus? Haha thank you tho
halsey,ff6n1kg,t1_ff5emig,1579630687.0,Thank you!
relationships,ff6hqf9,t3_erutwe,1579627454.0,"My girlfriend and I recently moved in with each other. Before we were living with two roommates so it was easy to blame any messes on them. Because we had roommates we were pretty good at keeping the communal space clean.

We moved into our own apartment in September and have been living together now for about four months. I will say it was rough. And it still is rough. I’m not anal about cleanliness but she seems not to have a standard at all.

I started getting snippy and frustrated because I felt like I was doing all the housework and she was not. I felt like I had to do the cleaning or whatever because otherwise it just would never get done. And so I finally told her that I felt like her mother. Always cleaning up after her.  

I honestly don’t think it’s fair that you work more hours and yet still have to do work at home. You were not bagging on him to do chores as a mother but as an equal partner in a relationship. You might have to come up with a chore chart if he is not responsible enough to help out around the house on his own. When you lived with roommates you have chores and rules and while having your own apartment with a partner means you can be a little more relaxed, it does not mean you cannot help with half of the share of work. 

Your frustrations are valid and if you do get angry at him it’s simply because it’s a build up of emotions that eventually get released somehow. Talk to him and tell him that you were not a maid, you are not a mother,  but you are girlfriend living in the same house as him. It’ll take time but hopefully he starts helping out"
halsey,ff5ei5o,t3_eroma8,1579589451.0,Do you have the link to this whole interview?
halsey,ff3a9dt,t3_er9hmb,1579537280.0,It’s so close to raping. It reminds me of Dont Play and Walls Could Talk.
halsey,ff298kj,t3_er6j8y,1579497556.0,"Because it’s so real and meaningful, it’s my favorite song on the album. I am not slow songs. But I never skip More"
CPTSD,ff1u223,t3_equc8n,1579486188.0,"I have a friend who grew up in a horrible house. And at age 6, CPS was called to come and check her out because of some bruising. 

The stupid CPS worker told my friend, who is a fucking child, that she shouldn’t want to go to a foster home because children get raped and stuff in foster homes. So what 6 year old would say “yes take me from my parents and put me there”. 

God life would have been so much better for her if he had actually taken her away. But nope. She stayed."
halsey,feze5tv,t1_fex3nhh,1579456433.0,I also like how to goes at the very end of Forever...(is a long time) into Dominics interlude with the whole “talk to your man” thing.
halsey,fezdpca,t3_eqlnm9,1579456270.0,"I liked someone else’s explanation on how she didn’t want it to be associated with Mania.  And that it’s more important as a stand alone. 

But the way I saw it, Halsey Had 2 different directions for her next album (meaning feelings, even colors). She could have gone Red and powerful and write more songs like Nightmare. But instead she went blue and leaned into Without Me."
halsey,fesavcn,t3_eqg1dq,1579363381.0,"The face looks like it’s missing something. Maybe add her nose? Or a smile. 

And I think the red would be nice. Keep the rest black but add that spice of color. 

You could even do blue since it’s “you should be sad”"
LifeAfterSchool,feoogsk,t1_fem0qvm,1579303053.0,"This is a great answer

Just wanted to add that surrounding yourself with people doing well can inspire you to do great. Versus being friends with people who aren’t doing anything with your life, can make you content to keep your current path"

halsey,fennfcl,t1_fen6l1n,1579288174.0,Well that makes me happy. I was hoping she would throw some queer songs our way again
halsey,fen56gn,t3_eq22e1,1579277211.0,Can we have track reaction threads too???
halsey,fen54mw,t1_fen1nas,1579277178.0,I couldn’t tell tho with the multiple pronouns. It seemed like she was signing from a male perspective (but tell one otherwise if I’m wrong please)

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fem0jot,t1_felr6a8,1579235880.0,How is the dog not talking about itself when it’s written in first person.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,felow1j,t1_felb3cj,1579227357.0,"“I wish I was beautiful” 
“A funny looking dog” 
“I wish I had a family of my own that would want me even though I’m not pretty” 

You’re right. They didn’t call her ugly. But they sure as hell didn’t call her beautiful. 

They made it seem like she had low self esteem because she’s not normal looking. I know it was to be funny but love how you look. Don’t talk down on yourself."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fekbsyp,t1_fek9llu,1579196764.0,Agreed. They called her ugly way to much in that description.
MadeMeSmile,fekben5,t3_epfoy7,1579196526.0,Everyone’s saying they want good friends like this. But these guys are respectful af. Keeping noise levels down for their neighbors.
comphet,feextz6,t1_feeczf1,1579043574.0,Omg riiiiiight. Average young. Average old. Majority of them are fineeeee

comphet,feczqu6,t3_eoejsk,1578991504.0,"Also, let’s be honest, how often does any woman get to have sex with a handsome and buff man. In reality, women will end up with okay looking men, who will get older, and (in my opinion) get more ugly. 

That’s one thing that solidified it for me. I did not want to spend the rest of my life growing old with a man. Just sounded gross. And older woman, I don’t mind her looks or just her in general."
AskReddit,fe9bfps,t1_fe7xdl3,1578936054.0,And I’m going to be labeled as a pedofile

ariheads,fdz03ic,t1_fdxny8u,1578785376.0,She did Needy before. It’ll be cool to see her perform it again now that she has those good tour memories

ariheads,fdnxprq,t3_embvga,1578594973.0,She says it at 2:05 if anyone is curious
ariheads,fdnxmhv,t3_embvga,1578594919.0,My favorite is the “where my makeup stans at?” Because I feel like they’re aren’t many of us so she’s my mood with the song.

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdn9pq2,t1_fdlhu2h,1578580994.0,It’s  just fun to yell “Jeffery stop humping that lady!”
ariheads,fdmpts3,t1_fdmmmeq,1578559852.0,"Omg this is my journey exactly. I knew of her songs in passing. But I didn’t become hooked until those same songs/music videos. Now I go back and listen to her albums from start to finish and wonder where’s she’s been all my life. 

So November 2018."
comphet,fdllkdj,t1_fdhu0t2,1578526766.0,"I just wanted to throw in my own experience. 

When I switched to women, it took me a little time to realize just how different the two were for me. I slowly realized that I kinda “blacked out” due to the intensity of the moment and my desire for her body. And my body would react with hip grinding (I had only seen people do that but never experienced it myself) Versus with men, I felt it was very calculated (does he like this? Does this feel good for him?). I was also a girl who never had an orgasm before having sex with a woman but I just assumed I was one of those girls who just didn’t come."
ariheads,fdkja0a,t1_fdcj428,1578504889.0,I love that song. It was honestly my favorite on the album

I can’t remember which song but I remember the live has a jump in one of the songs, which probs came from editing them together. When I first listened to it I thought it was my streaming service. But I think it’s her only 1 “mistake” in the album."
