bujo,fewndij,t1_few9pb2,1579415645.0,"Thanks so much for your input. The weight of this all falls on me... we are a split household and therein lie the issues. Some stuff I can keep track of and others Iâ€™ll never know. 

One day there may be a partner in this to disperse things but for now itâ€™s just me ðŸ’œ"
declutter,fevudfg,t3_eqlp39,1579401620.0,I went through boxes from middle school just a couple of years ago and found toenail clippings from my childhood family dog. Perfectly preserved in a little baggy. Obviously threw them away.
declutter,ferzd3r,t1_fepdtf0,1579359897.0,"I 100% agree with having that â€œphysicalâ€ proof to validate. I think moving the files to a separate USB could help for a bit, but seeking a therapist to have another human being validate those issues is also 100% an option, and a good one at that. I sought therapy during and after my last relationship, and it helped me sort everything out and realize just how bad things were. A 3rd party whoâ€™s mutual and there to help you for you and nothing else... thatâ€™s priceless. They have zero skin in the game. I felt silly going for awhile but I ended up getting more out of it than I ever imagined. 

Unfortunately I cannot delete some stuff yet as it may help in a court case. But as soon as I can figure out how to get everything moved somewhere else, those texts are gone, baby gone. Iâ€™ve gone far enough past the events and had enough validation to know that what happened really happened. 

I donâ€™t want to look back on the â€œgood times,â€ they were based on lies. I donâ€™t want to look back on the bad times, they were hell, and I donâ€™t want to keep reliving it. I want to move forward in my healing and keep working on me. 

Keep working on you, OP. Much love â¤ï¸âœŒðŸ¼"
bujo,ferwzvu,t1_feru5w5,1579359199.0,"I considered that... though I do recognize those foods more. We eat pretty clean as much as possible.. I know that artificial food coloring makes her lose her mind lol. Beyond that, artificial sugars are pretty lowâ€” I only allow candy once in a blue moon, and we donâ€™t typically eat packaged food. I feel like she actually has pretty â€œadultâ€ tastebuds... sheâ€™s not picky either. Thank you for the recommendation!!"
bulletjournal,fepklzs,t3_eq0h4v,1579322953.0,Beautiful! ðŸ˜ðŸ”¥
bujo,fepk68x,t1_fepjvvp,1579322615.0,Thank you!
bujo,feedcq8,t3_eoj6ea,1579031424.0,This is an awesome tracker!
bujo,febnsye,t1_feapklk,1578960819.0,Thank you! Thatâ€™s the size I just picked up in a really cheap journal to get me started. Iâ€™d been contemplating wanting a larger journal but I think this size will be just fine â˜ºï¸
bujo,feaowux,t3_eo7a1v,1578950912.0,What size journal is this? I love it!
madisonwi,fc2rh75,t1_fc2b8xu,1577371879.0,Yes. Just happened to catch it.
madisonwi,fc2arqu,t1_fc27tqe,1577349128.0,I saw the event happen on the frontage road as I drove past on midvale to get on the belt line.
madisonwi,fc0m0x1,t1_fc0aoql,1577294205.0,I witnessed the shooting at about 10 last night. When I later spoke to an officer it didnâ€™t sound like they had any suspects but maybe they donâ€™t normally say that. ðŸ¤·ðŸ¼â€â™€ï¸
aww,faa9w4t,t3_e83pin,1575905757.0,I have an Anatolian mix from overseas. Can confirm these breeds ALL have the sad puppy eyes mastered ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
