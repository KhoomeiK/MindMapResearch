AskReddit,fdsb5iu,t1_fdrzkl8,1578698564.0,"> Fire requires fuel and oxygen (and a source of ignition)

This is incorrect and dangerous information.

Fire is a reaction that requires three things: fuel, oxygen and heat. Ignition will happen spontaneously when all three things are above the required levels.

A source of ignition is simply the application of heat to create a localised point that brings all three requirements to the correct level to start the reaction. E.g. a lightning strike superheats a small spot beginning combustion.

The first thing any fire safety course teaches is about the triangle of fire (fuel, oxygen, heat) and how to stop the reaction safely by depriving the reaction of two of those things. They always stress how simply removing one of them (covering a frying pan fire with a lid to deprive oxygen) does not remove the fire risk because as soon as you take the lid off and oxygen is added back to the reaction, it will spontaneously burn again without an ignition source."
