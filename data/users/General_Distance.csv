AmItheAsshole,fdt3ca5,t3_en0xo2,1578711378.0,So you’re actually in an abusive relationship and are being gaslighted by him. You need to heavily consider leaving now-reach our to family or friends or other resources. Your baby is your new priority and the health and safety of your child will always need to come over him. If he is upset by this....he NEEDS to seek help. NTA
