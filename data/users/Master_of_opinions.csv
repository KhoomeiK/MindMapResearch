funny,ffk11vw,t1_ffk01vs,1580012547.0,"Well obviously I can't speak for the big leaders of religions. Maybe those people do have malicious intent. But because I went to church I at least trust my vicar to be a well-meaning person, even though I think the whole religion thing seems kinda silly now."
teenagers,ffk0mvv,t1_ffjvxti,1580012189.0,Ivan's indulged himself with a little too much potato oil this time. It'll be the gulag for him.
funny,ffk02oa,t1_ffj1rw4,1580011718.0,"Yeah. There's a huge culture in itself of how to be liked and accepted by the Reddit community. In order to be cool you have to use the native humour, have certain opinions, and so on. Sometimes I feel bad if I get upvotes when I know I was deliberately pandering."
funny,ffjzoi3,t1_ffiz0kl,1580011390.0,What do you mean 'people today'? It's always been like this.
funny,ffjzfaj,t1_ffjxe9u,1580011189.0,The thing is I don't even think most of it is Machiavellian. I think a lot of this control happens naturally amongst people like this. I imagine most religious leaders don't even understand what they're doing from that perspective.

Unconditional pessimism - It's all just terrible and that's it.

Conditional response - It may be bad, but we can all change this.

I say, what about unconditional optimism? Everything's going to be just fine!"
