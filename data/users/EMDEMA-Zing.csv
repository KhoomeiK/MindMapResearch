Drugs,ff7nz3x,t1_ff7n86t,1579654116.0,"yeah but now that i have a girl, the addiction thought patterns scare her, my mum also as we’ve become very close and open about my use so it’s disappointing for my 2 main ladies to demonstrate this weakness and blatant denial about my control over this herb.

i’m just very prone to stress and anger and i cop out of riding my emotions too much, after my first hard breakup i fell so hard onto kratom and since then i’ve been daily with it

i’ve made some steps recently to curb my addiction but getting off the daily is the hardest part for me right now 

i’m trying tho"
Drugs,ff7cg7o,t1_ff7btlv,1579646321.0,"it’s really hard dude i didn’t think it could be this hard and it’s fucking depressing

it’s like i have one mentality before i take it as in “i’ll be good with just this dose today” then i eat and the dose disappears and i’m fixating on the next one

at this point i get maybe an hour of a buzz and then i eat it goes away and then rinse repeat

i hate feeling so tied to it but i knew if i had some benzos i could get off of it super easy

but you mention that to your loved ones and they tell you “you’re going in circles” as my initial drug of abuse was benzos when i was 16. i’m 23 now

it’s funny to hear that i’m going in circles right after a mac’a album “circles” comes out

i’ll be good but i need to work on my mindsets more"

people around me don’t understand how i suffer such withdrawal from it but i was taking a lot"
Drugs,ff6f1zm,t1_ff65pda,1579625792.0,"careful w kratom my friend 

once you get into everyday and multiple doses a day it’s no walk “out” of the park 

insomnia, RLS, depression, mood swings, anxiety 

but i have never had to kick anything harder so perhaps i’m just a whimp but i’m trying to get off of an over a year daily habit and it’s torture 

keep it twice a week if you could, once a week is ideal"

shrooms,fag196r,t1_faf1vcl,1576037246.0,"tbh, the upvote and downvote feature of reddit is what brings your intellectual self worth into play. if one posts something they truly believe or something and then get downvoted to hell or some funny meme they created gets removed for low quality, one might experience a similar mental sadness similarly to if some picture they post on instagram doesn't get enough likes.

sort of how getting destroyed on FB is but instead people you know irl rarely know you by your reddit username"
