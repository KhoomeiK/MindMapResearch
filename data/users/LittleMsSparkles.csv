Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but you aren’t entitled to be rude and impose your beliefs on others. I didn’t decide to have a child until this year and mostly because my husband will
be the best father ever. Never did I go around telling others not to have kids."

AskReddit,fd53ogl,t1_fd1plas,1578173901.0,"Lived on Oahu for 4 years. I loved it generally. Parking sucks. Traffic sucks. A shortsighted mayonnaise sandwich designed the highway system and is now attempting to make the rail (possibly the biggest fail I have ever seen). No one can afford to buy any suitable
housing. People are not paid enough to live there. Homeless people are EVERYWHERE and the areas they live/stay are filthy. 

That being said, you can find great food. I don’t feel like groceries were much more expensive, we spent between $45-$100 a week on groceries doing meal prep. There are plenty of amazing things to see and do and most of them are free. There are some amazing humans there, very welcoming and full of aloha. I also saw some very local people hate anyone not a local, even a tattoo faced man punch a white girl in a popular bar near Waikiki simply for being white. 

It was fun to live where people went to vacation. We got to spend super fun days with friends and family. If it was another short period of time I wouldn’t mind living there again, but I wouldn’t want to live there for the rest of my life."

AskReddit,fcvv5g5,t1_fcugt4l,1578010811.0,Met my husband on WoW. In a guild together for 7+ years before we really sat and talked and became interested. Decided to meet up on the Santa Monica pier one day and spend the week together. One month later I moved to Hawaii to be with him. That was 4 years ago. We have been married nearly 2 years and are expecting a new little gamer. He’s the best.

LifeProTips,fcksifk,t3_ehora0,1577732238.0,Except when you get those asshole trucks that shine their lights in your mirror from seemingly your back seat and then flash high beams at you to go faster than the 10+ over the limit you’re already doing. I get so irrationally angry. I wish I had my trunk rigged with a shot ton of mirrors to pop up and blind them.
AskReddit,fckrpqs,t3_ehn3ua,1577731750.0,"Things I’ve had to explain to my mom are not the healthiest option...
1. Mozzarella cheese... she drowns things in it but considers it a healthy dairy food. 
2. Sourdough Bread... she says it is better for her than white bread. 
3. Ketchup... she puts it in meatloaf so she puts it in her egg white muffins. SUGAR 
4. Staying away from words like “fat free” “diet” “keto” “gluten free””low sodium””sugar free””organic” and assuming they mean healthy to learning to read and compare labels to see if it actually does have less sodium or sugar than other brands."
GetMotivated,fckr5jd,t3_ehn3ky,1577731405.0,I went alone to an Applebee’s after an evening class for cheese sticks and studying once. I looked up maybe 20 mins later and they had turned on black lights and people were in their pajamas. Apparently that restaurant had “fun” Friday night themes.

There are a few high yield savings accounts online these days, then when it’s built up a bit maybe a CD. I don’t think a 529 provides enough choice for the kid. Maybe they get a scholarship and want to buy a car or save for a down payment."
