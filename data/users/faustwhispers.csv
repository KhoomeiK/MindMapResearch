I'm now really close to my initial goal, and I tried on some dresses the other day and realized why other women hate dress shopping so much; turns out dresses can be very good at highlighting what you dislike about your body.

I feel good about how I look in casual wear and pants, so now I get to look forward to liking myself in dresses or skirts, too. Even if I think I'll always be a pants-wearer at heart, I hope I can finally have a good experience wearing a dress."
fatlogic,fee27ph,t3_eomg76,1579024865.0,"**rant:** I've been in a binge-restrict cycle for.... fuck, a month? a month and a half? essentially since December. I'll go three days of being very stringent with my calories for the day, and then two or three days of losing all semblance of control. I haven't meaningfully lost weight during that time. I totally get why, but it's unbelievably frustrating. 

I don't know why winter saps my self-control... it's baffling and very irritating; I have goals I want to achieve and I'd love to make winter a time of progress, not stagnation. also I *never feel good* after a binge. it's physically PAINFUL, and yet it's like I forget the lesson each time. ugh.

I think part of the problem is that I've gotten myself down to a weight where I don't actively hate how I look anymore? so it's like a side-effect of complacency. and while I don't hate how I look, I also want to look *even better*. I'm at a healthy BMI, I'm ""normal"" shaped. I want to be LEAN. and I'm holding myself back >:/

**...rave(?):** I know better things are coming, I can overcome this, and if I work hard I can achieve my goals. I've already come so far, I can keep going!"

CICO is how you lose weight. Eating less than you expend is how you lose weight.

But my binge-drinking, obstinate coworker is attempting OMAD to lose weight, which she WILL fail at because she's tried it before, and it's going to go **nowhere** once again because she makes herself miserable by over-restricting, and by whining to me about carbs.

I've lost weight and eaten mostly carbs along the way, sis. Get with the program.

I dunno, I'm just... slowly unraveling, haha. It's wild how once you learn The Secret (it's all about the calories, baby!), the amount of misinformation out there becomes enraging."
