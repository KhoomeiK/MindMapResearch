clothdiaps,fdy34pw,t3_en719w,1578775544.0,"1.) I changed diaper, put baby in a safe place, took diaper to bathroom, and then washed my hands. Immediately. Every time.  Through two children. 

Hand washing after toileting/diapering is good sanitation and not negotiable for me. 

2.) Depends. Some babies are multiple times a day poopers, others are weekly. 

3.) I always kept the pail bag in the bathroom, so non-issue."

Diplomatic immunity no longer matters?  Congratulations, your diplomats are now being held in some kind of third world country conditions prison because their host country does not approve of some sort of US policy towards them.  Diplomacy dies.

Should there be times that exceptions should be made because it's the morally right thing to do?  Yes, but unfortunately, there are so many different levels of morality that if any wiggle room is shown, it might as well be meaningless."
clothdiaps,fdwhvtj,t3_en950n,1578758836.0,"Some mega groups out there (particularly one whose acronym is a virus) like to claim that detergent build up is a myth and that it's just residue and is harmless.  I'm over it, so I now refer to it as ""detergent fairies.""  Some fairy stories describe fairies as little harmless things, and others describe them as bratty little things that cause trouble.  ""Detergent fairies"" allows people to choose whichever fairy myth they'd like rather than arguing over if it even exists.

That being said, detergent fairies can cause an ammonia smell.  I don't know how hard your water is, but the conventional wisdom is long hot wash without detergent to get the detergent out.  Possibly tossing in some OxiClean also helps."
