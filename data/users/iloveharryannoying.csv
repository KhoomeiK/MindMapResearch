Why me? Well, it just so happened that the concierge got stuck in it in-between floors and I just happened to hear him going to my friends' grandparents place (my neighbor) who lived right below us.  

Yea, it did not look as clean and shiny as the movies.."

WhitePeopleTwitter,feckyv3,t3_en66eq,1578976476.0,How they used to be *annoying. I know I was way more annoying. It’s amazing how easier it gets to tolerate people as they get older. Talking to people in their early 20s feels like you are attending a theme park where every attraction is obnoxious. Plus older people are more likely to have a more interesting job than the duo student at Starbucks.
