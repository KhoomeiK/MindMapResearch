bipolar2,ffggxci,t1_ffgfbd6,1579905980.0,Good luck to you!
bipolar2,ffgedu1,t1_ffgbvw5,1579904367.0,I haven't noticed any! I've ways been told it's the increased carb cravings but I take mine at night so I think that helps. No other side effects for me but it's only been about 6 weeks
bipolar2,ffg9pdv,t3_etgv2g,1579901484.0,"I'm currently on it! I started on 25mg, most for sleep. it killed my hunger. it took a couple weeks for me to even have an appetite. I'd cook thinking I was hungry and then look at it and not want it. I'm currently at 100mg, mostly for sleep still, but my doc is hoping it can also work as a low dose mood stabilizer along with my other meds. Hope this helps! Sorry, but I'm not on an SSRI nor have I ever been."
bipolar,ffe5ax4,t3_esyqmk,1579837079.0,"I was originally diagnosed with OCD a few years ago. I've since changed doctors a few times and all of them agree that I'm not, and that my obsessions/paranoia/anxiety is linked to my mania and mixed episodes. I'm also on 100mg of Seroquel along with a couple other things. Hope this helps!"

bipolar2,ff4v7u9,t1_ff4kvfy,1579573237.0,I've never heard that before!!! my Seroquel kicks in perfectly if I take it as soon as I tsrt getting ready for bed. if I don't then I stay up in bed at least an hour after my boyfriend falls asleep. I'll try that though! about the relationship-- everything about us is perfect until I have an episode. during the episode my unhappiness feels so real. so real that today I almost ended it. so I completely understand.
BipolarReddit,ff2gg58,t3_er9rwg,1579505068.0,lamictal has done this for me
bipolar,ff219do,t3_er5ip3,1579491095.0,"I was originally diagnosed with OCD because of intrusive thoughts, but it didn't explain the rest of my problems. My current doctor believes my mania includes intrusive thoughts, but that I don't necessarily have OCD"

bipolar,fev80ub,t1_feupxe6,1579394293.0,"Actually, 6:30 is an exaggeration depending on the day.  My days are 7am-7:45pm  most days because I have work then night classes. I get home, change clothes, take my meds, cook, watch a couple episodes on Netflix or do homework then go to bed. I prioritize going to bed as early as possible (11 at the very latest during the week). I'm usually able to do work for about an hour after dinner if I need to. The first time I started the routine it was hard. But after that it's fine. I'm currently on 100mg + 200mg lithium + 200mg lamictal. Let me know if you need anything! Feel free to message me with questions"
bipolar,feug8lk,t3_eqn1zh,1579386231.0,"Have you tried taking it in the eveninv? and making sure to take it not too close to bed time. If I'm going to bed around nine, I'll take it at about 6:30. that way you're giving it time to kick in and it doesn't last well into the morning. that's what helps me! I'm in grad school (not for medicine) so I feel your pain!"
bipolar,feowxci,t3_eq8xuz,1579307171.0,it increases your carb cravings

BostonTerrier,feok0rk,t3_eq7juk,1579301248.0,try ceramic food and water bowls if you aren't already??
bipolar,feoddje,t3_eq744y,1579298640.0,"my doc told me after 5 days you have to start back at 25mg.

you might have some withdrawal symptoms??"
bipolar2,feloi22,t3_eptfqn,1579227090.0,you're fine for five days then you have to titrate back up from 25 :(
