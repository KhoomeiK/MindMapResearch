Menieres,ffcd0as,t1_ffc7lk1,1579796801.0,Took a dark turn there at the end. Please don't do that. There is a drug that is supposed to heal hearing loss due to damaged hairs (like the hearing loss most meniere's patients have) that is going to be released in 5-9 years. There is hope.

Why are they filming?

Why is the car filled with so many people?"

We present our thoughts as questions and statements because it is easier to interpret them that way. But most of the time, I'm not even thinking in questions or statements. Im thinking in mood and outcomes.

Example: I am partially deaf with meniere's so i won't know if i can hear a person talking right next to me in a few hours let alone tomorrow. So when i plan stuff, i usually hope that i can hear well that day. I play our scenarios in my head on what i will do if i can't hear well. These scenarios usually allow for me to do some slight planning. But as life usually goes, it never goes to exact plan. When it doesn't, i feel bad about myself, i don't mentally ask myself any questions or tell myself anything. I know there is nothing I can do about it. But i feel terrible regardless. As im a ""broken human"" in the eyes of normal people. 

That's not a question but rather an embedded idea of myself that triggers during events such as the example i mentioned. Simply telling myself to think of it differently isnt going to change it at least to a useful standpoint as its an embedded idea, or i should say conditioned as i conditioned myself into it during my primary school."

The reposts are also confirmed to be a good fit for the sub and usually are reposts from that same sub."

It is very depressing to see that people resort to such violence for their petty reasons. 

I can see in the video that 
1. The killer was looking for another victim as he got shot. He got put down like the scum that he is before he could get another round off thankfully.
2. There were several other people with guns so even if this hero was unable to stop him hopefully another would have. (Although some of them could use some work on crossfire with other members of the congregation but i do not blame them for not thinking about that too much as I am sure it is a terrifying experience that i couldn't even begin to imagine and adrenaline just destroys rational thinking)"
getdisciplined,fcbxe6x,t3_egq1qx,1577592033.0,"Have tinnitus that varies on a day to day basis. 

Impossible to have silence and sometimes i cant even drown it out with soft piano music or ambiance. I've tried meditating before and what i just stated plus constantly wandering mind does not allow me to sit still and just relax for 3 minutes, let alone 10-20. 

Suggestions? As i've am now trying different forms of relaxation that come in forms of exercise, watching new movies, etc."
Advice,fc94ma9,t3_egjzh0,1577546952.0,"If you don't have the money. I researched a bunch to find proper lifting forms when i wanted to start weight lifting. When i went to the gym to try them out for the first time, i practiced with lighter weights in front of a mirror until my form was down (this could take days if you cant get the proper form down. Always lift with proper form). 

If you don't want to lift, I suggest researching whatever you want to do. Whether stretching or yoga or racquetball or whatever interests you. 

The point of the gym is to provide the ability for people to work out what they want to work out the way they want to work out and have fun to the best of your ability. 

P.S. By ""way they want to work out"" i mean what regimen they want to do. Please font improperly lift/use the machine/stretch. That may cause injuries."
