these types of situations really show more about the other person than you, it was a huge dick move on his part and really you never, ever should have to settle for something that makes you feel lesser or not enough, you deserve much more than that and i’m truthfully sorry you’re in a situation like this, it’s probably really scary since you there’s not much you can turn around to but still once you finally come to a peaceful mindset get in a really serious conversation with him and just be genuine about your emotions and everything that’s passing in your mind. communication is really key specially since you don’t have any place to go right now. express what you want, hopefully you and him can come to an equal grounding. but if he does not reciprocate the same transparency, honey, it’s done. that just the right amount of evidence to show he isn’t trustworthy. but before it gets to the point where you might need to move out, try to get some middle ground between you two, that’s why it’s import to discuss and not argue. 

best of luck, i’m really sorry you need to be dealing with this."

Androgynoushotties,ffhqf2e,t3_etp5ep,1579948390.0,you’re very pretty!
lgbt,ffhq6n6,t3_etmwln,1579948031.0,rather than getting their hopes up from texting them now and then it’s better to be straight up sometimes. just casually and respectfully say something along “hey i’m kinda not a talkative person and a lot of chatting just isn’t my go to” hopefully they’ll get the point ;3
lgbt,ffhpmzv,t3_etmiub,1579947194.0,"you might just be a big mix of everything hahah (though i do think you might just be a man, as in maybe you’re a transgender man, or maybe demiboy or something along transmasc (i am one trans man myself))

but when it comes to your sexuality (since as we know gender and sexuality do not correlate) you might be maybe bisexual or pansexual but like girls a little bit more. you don’t necessarily have to be 50/50 to be bi you can like girls 75% of the time but guys 25%, still very much bi! 

now your lack of desire for sex simply just may mean your some sort of asexual or touch adverse. i’m not too informed in this topic so it might be more of help to talk to someone in r/asexual  

but biggest thing to know here it’s that it’s all just a biggg spectrum and the labels are just a place to find people who might relate with you and make yourself a nice home, but that doesn’t mean that they will describe you perfectly. 

best of luck in your discovery journey! and if you need some further explanation i’d be glad to help :)"
femboy,ffhp6s6,t1_ffhos9w,1579946495.0,"thanks for letting me know! (and i agree with that as well hah) though if it’s not too personal too ask, feel free to ignore, how did you guys meet or end up dating? hardest part, for me at least, it’s just hard to find people with this kind of taste haha"
lgbt,ffhozlg,t3_etmhwh,1579946189.0,"hey there~ i’m a trans man(ftm) and i really want you to know that you are not alone. i had these emotions too, i was very lost and had no one to relate to or talk with too and you should really know that you are completely valid. your thoughts are not wrong. you are amazing in your own way and i’m genuinely so proud that you made it over here to converse about this. even if it was just a little bit, i’m proud that you got to the point of accepting your thoughts. 

depending on where you live, there is some places that have lgbt support, with either therapy or group sessions just to converse, and they do not require parental consent. the problem is that they might be distant from where you live, and you might need to go behind your parents back. but that’s just what might take to make you feel a bit more yourself. (i will send you some links to these places if you’re interested) 

otherwise, find some online groups. discord groups, gayming groups, etc etc. these groups will genuinely help you get by so much. for friends, for support, for information, anything. this is where i spent most of my effort into and it really kept me going. 

i hope you will get to someplace you love. best of luck and if you ever need to talk i’m right here. never forget you are valid, friend!"
lgbt,ffhoc42,t3_etkyel,1579945177.0,"take some time for yourself and try to sort things out. personally, i think you might sit somewhere around that bisexual realm but i don’t know much about you so you, yourself, experiment with some new things, new people, all that good stuff, maybe find a therapist too? your anxiety might hassle you a bit so having that place to lean on and openly talk about your experiences will definitely help in the long run.  best of luck mate! hope you’ll find yourself. 

( also wasn’t too sure if you were asking for help on clarifying your sexually or with your friend that has been confusing you. let me know if i answered the wrong question )"
