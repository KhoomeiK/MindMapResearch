I literally curled up on a couch for the first two weeks, streamed South Park constantly and ordered in Chinese delivery because I was not fit to be around other human beings. After that, I took up running.   

I hope you find something that works for you. Good luck! I’m rooting for you!"

That being said, I’ve also eaten out of dumpsters and eaten roadkill. Because I’m sure someone is going to ask- the worst food borne illness I ever got was from McDonalds chicken nuggets (I bought- not from the dumpster) in Sedona."

Dude. The US really needs to get its shit together and abolish ICE. It terrifies me thinking about the way immigrants are being treated right now, and what void progress if Herr Cheeto gets re-elected."
