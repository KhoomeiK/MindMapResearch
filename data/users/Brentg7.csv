buildapc,feyg5pc,t1_feye9r0,1579445060.0,"thanks, I have the drivers for those screws too, and are definitely a possibility. 

nope wife is just mentally ill.  she ripped all her electronics apart too.  she's goes through more laptops and phones in a year, then I've ever owned.   she also spends enormous amounts of time going over event logs on the routers and going through her OS registry, system files, and anything she can looking for things she thinks shouldn't be there. she even bought some 700$ bug detector that the sellar told her he would sue her if she opened it.  I opened it it was nothing but some LED lights and some diodes inside with a pizo speaker. it's kinda sad, but  lately things have been better or she's just hiding it better.  oh well, I love her and I have my shit too."
buildapc,fexi21m,t1_fexfufg,1579431349.0,">Yeah that could also work too. Glad to be of help. Iâ€™m even more intrigued now as to why you wouldnâ€™t want your wife to be able to get into the computer caseðŸ˜‚ 

I found these too, but they don't get a dimensions on thread size I don't feel like tapping holes.

it's a long story, but I'll keep it short.  when she isn't on her meds right, combined with lack of sleep, bad eating habits she sometimes exhibits psychotic episodes.  she gets very paranoid and is convinced the house is bugged the network is hacked and all our devices are compromised.  my last computer she ripped it apart took all the hard drives out remove the Wi-Fi from the motherboard (ruined it).  she also killed my FiOS set-top boxes, and disassemble my laptop again trying to remove the Wi-Fi and the hard drives.  this was like 13 years ago I haven't l~~been~~ built computer since and I've been relying on my phone.  just built a rig to run my Valve index and Id like to not repeat this."

edit:. snakeheads are now also illegal to buy/keep as pets(aquariums) in MD."
