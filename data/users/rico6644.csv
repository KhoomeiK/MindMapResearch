Boxing,fdqtxy6,t1_fdqpgtb,1578674808.0,Lol I've spoken English all my life and that dude has a better vocabulary than me
Boxing,fdqiu4m,t1_fdqh9o6,1578667736.0,Nah don't worry mate. You literally wrote that absolutely perfectly. Would not have guessed it wasn't your first language
todayilearned,fdop29d,t1_fdnqtup,1578609704.0,Yeah I'm from Ireland. Totally different to the American system I think
rugbyunion,fdjsh60,t1_fdjieec,1578485872.0,Liam Williams is my favourite player to watch (Bar Finn Russell) but I also hate him so much. Such a twat
todayilearned,fditdir,t1_fdit5ii,1578450605.0,Fair enough maybe youre right. Never flown anything but economy myself so idk the difference really always assumed it was first
todayilearned,fdistna,t1_fdilhlf,1578450259.0,"Lol it's not that expensive though mate. I have a friend who works a full time job while in college and uses the money mainly on travelling. And refuses to fly economy. Like if we're all flying somewhere he'd sit up on his own while we're in economy. Not a smart way to spend your money into but far from impossible



Edit : also jobs good but not crazy. Like 25/30k a year I think"
ireland,fdiqzcs,t1_fdhkwv3,1578449080.0,Mate it's a complex thing. The RIC was just a police force. There were branches like the auxiliaries were awful bastards but a good chunk of the RIC were just normal people trying to keep the peace. Obviously stupid to commemorate them but the RIC as a whole isn't liek the Gestapo or something
reddevils,fdhxfs9,t1_fdhvtua,1578431915.0,Idk if he's even serviceable at AM. He's better but he constantly misses runs and just blazes the ball over the bar. He's shocking on the ball constantly losing possession and doesn't really add much bar the odd nice delivery
sports,fddv3pk,t1_fddus1j,1578324716.0,"Lol I've actually read the book but don't remember that part. Id assume it's cause they wanted to mould him into a back to goal type target man. Wanted him breaking balls and drawing attention more than dribbling. That's what makes Zlatan so special. Dudes like 6'5, strong as an ox and still has incredible on the ball skills"
Boxing,fd5wtx1,t3_ek4l3e,1578182496.0,Lol this is the most salty thing I've ever read
reddevils,fd5o5yl,t3_ek134f,1578179582.0,Are refs always pricks or is it just when we're playing?
rugbyunion,fcynh68,t3_ejgtcw,1578083341.0,Niall Scannell been quietly great. Hope he can stay fit and string a good run of games together
reddevils,fcnphdh,t1_fcnp3ww,1577815969.0,"Same was so excited for a Fred, McSauce Pogba combo. Dunno if we'll ever see it at this rate"
soccer,fcnp1zb,t1_fcnot9z,1577815724.0,Idk about that don't think you can say the coaching is faultless but yeah recruitment was and is the bigger issue. Hopefully we've more windows like the summer coming
soccer,fcnnwsq,t1_fcnngoo,1577815067.0,So? They're all playing much better than they did at United implying United was the issue which is what Mino was saying. There's circumstances that can partially explain all their bad form at United but even still
soccer,fcnmjth,t1_fcnlo6r,1577814335.0,Lol like I said in numerous other comments I don't think I United are some club that ruins players. Minos a cunt and he's talking bollocks. But the guy I was replying to clearly picked players to undermine the argument when we've had a white a few players improve after leaving us
soccer,fcncba5,t1_fcnby59,1577808622.0,Yeah I think it's Minos talking shit and there's circumstances surrounding all the failures. Was just pointing out that many players have improved after leaving the club
soccer,fcn7zdj,t1_fcn7cv0,1577805631.0,"Yeah I think give Ole till the end of the season minimum. Saw a great point that's never brought up on r/reddevils the last day but Ole also really seems to be trying to overhaul the culture of the club and that's something that we need more than any player or manager. Also his 3 signings have all been relative hits, by far our best transfer window in years. Our fanbase can be absolutely toxic sometimes"
soccer,fcn6cyo,t1_fcn5yzb,1577804446.0,"The problem is McTominay and Fred were half the players they are now last season and that meant Pogba had to play deep cause we legit had noone else. He can play there to a pretty decent level bit it's not his best position by any stretch of the imagination. When we've been able to let him loose as a more a attacking player he's looked like a borderline Balloon Dor contender. 


Again totally a team game but id interpret that as there's only so much Pogba can do when he's playing with mid table talent. But I think our team has made massive improvements since Pogbas been injured. I think if we can have Fred and McSauce deep and Pogba as a 10 we'll see him at his very best again"
soccer,fcn3p9i,t1_fcn34r7,1577802408.0,"Yeah edited my comment to say a shambles at times cause it hasn't been all bad. But I'd also argue that Mourinho achieved that despite the club. When I'm calling the club a shambles it's allowing Moyes to totally overhaul the coaching staff. Our brainless recruiting. Our inability to sell players who are 100% not good enough to play for the club. Giving dudes like Jones a new contract while letting Herrera leave. The way we massively massively overpay salaries and ruin the structure so now everryone feels they deserve 200k a week. List goes on




Honestly in hindsight Mou was dead right. Having that season with that squad and board and all may well be his most impressive achievement"
soccer,fcn2xu2,t1_fcn2lko,1577801791.0,Yeah I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as it's painted to be Minos talking bullshit. but the dude above was clearly hand picking examples that suited him when there's clearly ones that have been good after leaving
soccer,fcn2tla,t1_fcn2a5r,1577801694.0,"Yeah I definitely agree it was shocking for a while.  Mourinho in particular doesn't seem to have much interest in improving his squad, just winning. It's why I'd be so interested in Poch coming in. Although since McKenna, Carrick and Phelan have come in I think the players have been improving. AWB has been looking a bit more comfortable with the ball at his feet recently and Rashford passing is getting better and better. DJ has improved massively even since he start of the season and McTominay has taken massive leaps forward. Even Lindelof although he was pretty good at the start of last season too. Our squad has bags of potential just has to realise it"
soccer,fcn1s2s,t1_fcn0uue,1577800810.0,"No Di Maria, Falcao, Depay, Zaha. While I do think our clubs a bit of a shambles at times it's stupid to say we've ruined Pogba. He's been one of our most consistent good performers and we look a much worse team without him (not a high bar over the last 4 years or whatever lol). Most of the controversy has been off the pitch and it's mainly him and Minos doing"
AskReddit,fcmafpx,t1_fcmaerz,1577768667.0,Then you're using survive wrong mate
AskReddit,fcma5j6,t1_fcm9ufp,1577768422.0,Paint ball is literally a simulated fight to the death so yeah I suppose survive does make sense there. Would you say you survived a game of hide and seek?
todayilearned,fcm9zs5,t1_fcm9dpn,1577768288.0,Yeah I love it too. Ruins the episodes when you've someone constantly saying why that should have been diagnosed immediately or the symptoms don't add up in the end lol
todayilearned,fcm969f,t1_fcm84qh,1577767607.0,Hahah. Me and my brother's loved House. My parents could barely sit through 5 minutes though. Said it was the most unrealistic show they'd ever seen
AskReddit,fcm8w0c,t1_fcm8log,1577767375.0,"
> Not when it's a timeframe that is being survived.


That's your comment from above. You don't survive a timeframe unless the end involves you dieing"
AskReddit,fcm82v1,t1_fcm7e48,1577766722.0,Lol you actually gonna link something that doesn't support your argument
todayilearned,fcm7qm2,t1_fcm7gpq,1577766447.0,Like it's totally understandable. No one wants to see a loved one die and it's one of those things where the worry would have you sitting up researching for hours. But they don't realise they're probably just annoying the doctor. Like your Granny trying to give you advice on computers lol
todayilearned,fcm727c,t1_fcm6rya,1577765919.0,No I'm not I'm from Ireland. It's much more common than you'd think
todayilearned,fcm48zv,t1_fcm3z4x,1577763837.0,Exactly. We should just cut out the middle men and let the families treat the sick
maybemaybemaybe,fcm3yno,t1_fck85xj,1577763624.0,"Are you joking? He hit her with a tiny tap that you would not feel at all. Definitely not a jab to the face


Edit ok nevermind it wasn't even a tap to the face he didn't hit her at all. Basically threw his hand out but had started retracting it before he'd even hit her"
todayilearned,fcm2ge9,t1_fcm1lk3,1577762492.0,Not to be insensitive but this is a random person on Reddit. My parents are doctors and they've always said that the family are pretty untrustworthy because of how biased they are in situations like this. This could definitely be total negligence but there also could be countless reasons why the test wasn't necessary that the family generally ignore once something has gone wrong. My parents constantly have family of patients telling them what medicine they should be prescribing or what tests you should be doing

Boxing,fcgjf0h,t1_fcg2syg,1577640791.0,Lol tf you talking about. For his last fight he weight 207 in the cage. He's could easily get over 220 when he's out of training camp. For that same fight Costa rehydrated from 185 to 214 on fight night

quityourbullshit,fc723wp,t1_fc71s68,1577495499.0,">""The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar Left, and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black. But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.""
