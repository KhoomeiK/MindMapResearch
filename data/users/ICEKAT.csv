instantkarma,ff6llz1,t1_ff69zqs,1579629813.0,"Somebody's taking the train to sleepytime junction/ somebody's so fucked up he can barely function. All ABOARD! Cries the man-a-geer, whispers 'sleepytime junction' in your ear. Somebody's taking the train to sleepytime junction."
MorbidReality,ff3oywz,t1_ff3mzcg,1579545737.0,Basement + pressure on any exits that swing inwards (which I suspect every one was) = no way out of a flash flood.
MorbidReality,ff3oqpb,t1_ff3nxua,1579545599.0,"Your individual one cannot break, and if it breaks, since it's literally everyone's hot water, it gets fixed quickly. That's the idea anyway. Similar to how apartments work in the US."
millionairemakers,fethuq1,t3_eq81a8,1579375605.0,Good Fortune to everyone.
MensRights,fek8xia,t1_fejxygl,1579195069.0,"This has literally nothing to do with feminism, nor men's rights. If you mock disabled people, as a public figure, you deserve to have your life ruined. It's rather simple. Not ruining a public figure who mocks the disabled tells the world that the disabled are less than us, they deserve mockery and derision. If we do not defend the weakest among us, we are no better than, in fact are worse to each other than, the animals we claim to be better than."
MensRights,fejuenv,t1_fejtrvw,1579186082.0,"Yeah, no. When their entire job is about being a face of something, and they mock the disabled, they deserve to have their lives destroyed."

politics,fegovpk,t1_feglc9t,1579099024.0,Because it works to have CNN swing further right to 'appear balanced.' It's part of the plan.
pokemon,febsc4a,t3_eo76z1,1578962142.0,"Sabrina was my fav in the first game. First real, tough gym. Captures her essence perfectly."
politics,febpbdw,t1_febkxm8,1578961276.0,"And I was making a joke about Putin being a 'queen' ie. Homosexual, servicing China. Just expounding upon your initial joke. :)"
politics,feaxznm,t1_feawpcb,1578953380.0,"Valid, however any parent -should- be doubly aghast, and disgusted by the behaviour of the 'best' people surrounding your president. To have voted this thing in should fill them with extra shame.

This is just part of the human condition, as they -should- be more emotionally connected to this kind of crime than non parents, due to the way parenting chemicals work."
politics,feavsip,t1_feav7lj,1578952680.0,China's queen. They're the bishops. Well McConnel is. Trump isn't even a pawn.

I'm guessing being made to perform nightly in front of cheering drunks in Vegas is not a way to get a tiger to like you."
pcmasterrace,fdwf1zk,t3_en51nu,1578758065.0,"Subnautica for me right now. I want to watch every one play through it, and maybe replay it. Such a good game."
aww,fdqiyvd,t1_fdqgyzh,1578667826.0,Murdoch is not an outlet.
aww,fdq9ra6,t1_fdq7ri3,1578660473.0,"Except Rupert Murdoch -is- actually a big evil within the world media juggernaut. Of course public agencies propagandize for their current establishment, it's how they're paid after all. But you can't look at the Murdoch news machine and call npr, CNN, nyt, etc equivalent with such a thin argument."
canada,fdnpikr,t1_fdnjnil,1578590444.0,"Not true even if you aren't native. If you so much as dress slightly oddly, they will screw you, try to make you angry, or just emotional, all so they can claim they're 'protecting the public' if you snap and they haul you away.

They treat anyone who doesn't fit in their exact lifestyle as worthless. Anyone who isn't white has it even worse. Unless they're looking for good PR."
Cooking,fdl7r76,t3_eluurw,1578518485.0,"If they cleaned? Maybe. If they shopped and cleaned, yes. If they just showed up, made food out of whatever I had and buggered off? Hell no. I can do that, and at least the time spent in my kitchen is me time."
