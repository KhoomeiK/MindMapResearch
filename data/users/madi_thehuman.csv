Right now you have bad coping mechanisms. To cope with your problems you ran to what helps in the short term (dopamine bursts and distraction from porn and games) and now you're realizing it's not working. Having bad coping mechanisms does not mean you're a fucked up person. 

I think a lot of your self judgements are based on societal expectations. Being expected to move out at 18 is a cultural thing. it says nothing about your worth

human sexuality is a spectrum. the shame that you're feeling right now is probably related to an internalized notion that it is bad for a man to be anything but straight. This is what our culture teaches us, but once again it has no baring on who you are as a person.

I would try to keep an open mind. having a personality disorder is not the end of the world, just like a lot of people are upset about their bipolar diagnosis but eventually come to terms with it. your diagnosis does not define you."
