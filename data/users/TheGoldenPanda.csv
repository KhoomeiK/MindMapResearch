Rammstein,ffbf4g1,t3_eslb4l,1579762576.0,"Hmm, I only stand 5'8"" but based off this post I would rather be in the back row of the Feurerzone. Hopefully it all works out though"
Rammstein,ffbf0sd,t3_esldtw,1579762455.0,Where my fellow loners at? Attending solo since none of my friends like Rammstein or can afford to go :(

Rammstein,ffa0xee,t3_esg7qr,1579725659.0,At first I was sad that all of them had gone but I just refreshed once or twice and managed to get myself a ticket.
Rammstein,ffa0rxt,t3_esgyue,1579725570.0,See ya'll there! I'm going alone as my friends do not like Rammstein :( But it'll be exciting to see LA for the first time
hempflowers,ff8nosn,t1_ff8e35o,1579687721.0,That's actually a valid point.
hempflowers,ff85bbq,t3_es6avc,1579666398.0,Where do you guys get your cartridges from? I know a while back there was a thing going on with THC cartridges but I can't recall the specifics of it
Rammstein,ff7f0x9,t1_ff7ep8g,1579648040.0,As much as I want to see the band front and center I would prefer not to stand the entire time. Hoping for seats too
Rammstein,ff7el4j,t1_ff7edu2,1579647747.0,I'm down to spend that and more! I have friends and family down there so hopefully I can mooch off a sleeping space. Just got to figure out travel

Rammstein,ff4dqqz,t3_eredee,1579561195.0,"I knew the chances of them being at Aftershock were low but I was hoping to save some money by not having to travel down state. However, I'm more than happy to spend money to see my favorite band! Hopefully I can mooch off a sleeping space from my buddy who lives in LA"
aww,ff02ndy,t3_er11sm,1579464503.0,I'll take the whole stock
bjj,fepa2xq,t1_fe8emkx,1579315532.0,""" We are committing $40 per rashguard to WIRES Australian Wildlife Rescue.  That truthfully accounts for more than the actual cost factoring in production, shipping, packaging, processing, etc.  That doesn’t take into the account the shipping charges we are absorbing on orders over $100 (free shipping).  I hope this helps and you value our transparency.  We have been updating the tally and will show proof the collective gift our Jiu Jitsu community has amassed.

Thanks for the question and I hope you will participate.

AftershockFestival,fep58vc,t3_ep73or,1579312417.0,I saw the announcements for a NA tour and I was preparing to save up money for travel and hotel. Of course if they came to Aftershock all I would need is the ticket! My favorite band hands down. It'd be bonkers if they came here to Sac
judo,feooxkt,t3_eo49um,1579303307.0,I'm a hefty boy and I've been thrown by my classmates in BJJ who are much smaller than me using something like a drop seoi nage. Based on this experience I know those much smaller than me in weight are capable if enough variables are in their favor.
judo,feoolq8,t3_eoml15,1579303132.0,"My issue as well! I posted a while back in the open mat thread about my passive personality. Although I am a bit more aggressive in BJJ going for attacks and sweeps, when it comes to Judo I mainly try for ashi waza (poorly). Theres just something of a mental block going for anything else.

&#x200B;

All my classmates in BJJ and Judo are aware of this and my coaches are constantly pushing for me to use my weight (big boy) and be a bit more aggressive.   


It took a while for me to go for attacks in BJJ, mainly due to poor position but I'm hoping just through time I start opening up more in Judo"

I get super dizzy if I don't take it for two days. Good to see others can use hemp instead of meds"

Sacramento,fdun87m,t3_ems6c6,1578735672.0,I remember Mattress Factory's in house brand was decently priced. Its just an innerspring mattress. May want to give them a call. I bought a nice mattress from them but it was a brand name one. Their customer service was great
bjj,fdsh62p,t3_emp1ic,1578702661.0,"I have a very passive personality, it's just who I am. I have always been a go with the flow type of person since childhood but it's causing some issues for training.

My passiveness has carried into rolling in BJJ as well as Randori (rolling equivalent in Judo). In BJJ although I definitely do go for submissions and passes and try to escape bad positions I generally tend to be reactive. In the past I wouldn't go for anything so ive sort of broken a bit out of my shell

In Judo I don't even really go for throws instead always trying to do counters to my training mates that attempt them .

Any advice from others like me or from coaches with students with my personality?"
