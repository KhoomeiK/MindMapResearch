RandomActsOfGaming,fflfdeo,t3_eu42br,1580039028.0,"Thank you for doing this. I pick Divinity Original Sin 2 and it is currently on sale on steam for 50% off. I played it a little bit co-op with my friend's copy via remote play and it is really fun. I want to get a copy so I could co-op adventure with my brother. 

Favorite song to listen when I am sad: [Sea of voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c_PQubEwtw). When I'm sad, sad music often lets me tap deeper into my emotions and help me get out what I'm feeling so I can feel better."

pcgaming,fcax199,t3_egodq3,1577578296.0,"Wow! a lot of great games are given here.  I would like to request for Bossgard because it looks fun in coop and with Steam's remote play together feature, my friends can play via internet like we did last night with Stick Fight and it was ton of fun. I am saving to buy a game that I wanted to play forever: the Divinity OS series. Only a couple bucks short and hopefully I had enough from selling the trading cards before the sale ends.

Thanks for doing this and happy new year to you OP."
