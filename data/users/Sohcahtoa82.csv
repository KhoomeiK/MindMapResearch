Not according to the corrupt courts that protect them from repercussions.  The cop that shot Daniel Shaver was found not guilty because the prosecutors *and* defense attorneys asked the judge the seal the body cam footage.  The cop that shot Charles Kinsey was charged with negligent discharge and found not guilty. 

> Are you implying that these outlying events are an excuse to fight police?

Not at all.  I will 100% agree that the place to fight cops is the court room, not the street.  It's inconvenient and will ruin your day, but better than ruining your life.

> I'm not sure. what your point is bringing that up now

I'm just trying to fight the idea that ""If you comply, you'll be fine!"" because it creates a victim-blaming narrative which leads to people allowing cops to get away with anything they want.  If you point a gun at a cop (Or anyone, really), then you deserve whatever happens next, but spreading the ""Comply!"" message in a world where cops aren't punished creates a world where cops can stomp all over your rights and freedoms."

Garbage lines are what define multi-player Tetris.  It's how you make Tetris competitive.

Judging by the rest of your comments, you're probably just not good at the game.  Winning a game requires a *lot* of skill.  You need to play *fast* to do well at all.  If garbage is stacking faster than you can clear, you're playing too slowly.  Look how fast [this guy](https://youtu.be/YALbig68rpc) is playing.  If you're not dropping pieces as fast as he does, you have no chance of winning.

Also, you *want* to get targeted.  If you have more than 3 people targeting you, you'll get a huge bonus to the amount of garbage you send to other people (which also means clearing garbage from your queue), so switch your attack mode to ""Attackers"" and get some easy badges!"

That's because YouTube and Netflix only use 5-15 Mbps.

And while web pages can be stupid with their sizes, even on my own 30 Mbps internet, they load in only a second or two.

Admittedly, this frustrates the hardcore gamers because their skill is not rewarded, but it makes it fun for the non-gamers because they have a chance to win.
