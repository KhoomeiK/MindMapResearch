""Child abuse survivor"" and that's what you are. There is no shame in that. You got out. 

I use morbid humor to get past all I went through as a coping mechanism but staying honest and true to what you overcame is a lot more healthy. 
Don't forget that you don't have to tell people what happened, or even the situation. 
Just say something along the lines of ""I survived, left, and I'm not going back"" and leave it as that. 
Excuses being more questions. A blunt answer usually results in the situation being left alone.

raisedbynarcissists,ffh6rsh,t1_ffh5xpr,1579924687.0,"There are kids out there in cars every day. Newborns being driven home for the first time. Animals going to and from vet offices. People with families, people who are loved, people who live their lives. 
Your father could end an entire family and will if he continues. He needs a serious wake up call and it's not going to happen if someone just let's this continue until he finally destroys someone's life. 
You could have died. 
You didn't make him drink, you didn't make him drive. 
He drank, he decided to drive. He could have said ""I'm so sorry, OP, I have been drinking. Is there another way for you to get home?"" Instead he risked your life and every single person on that road. 
Alcoholism kills. 
If the only way for him to learn is to be dragged out of the car and arrested in front of you, hardly surviving after hitting someone/another car, or landing himself in jail... That's fucked up. 
The only way you could have caused him to drive today was if you possessed his body and forced him to drive. 
Everything else was up to him. 

I've been there. I've dealt with a similar situation. It'll destroy your life if he was the reason someone didn't get to wake up to their family anymore."

She would purr and purr while giving me kisses until the moment passed. 

I miss her more than anything. 

My 9month old kitten will treat me like a playmate and not like a regular cuddly person.

There are a ton of things that could match up with what you're feeling. For me, it was extremely severe sleep apnea. 
Your doctor will be able to tell you more than any of us can. 
It'll also save you the suffering of trying to ""fix"" things yourself and them failing or not being done correctly because we don't know your medical history, family medical history, you, your exact diet, your sleep quality, your daily activities, your mental state, etc. 
There are way too many factors for strangers on Reddit to give you an accurate answer. 


TL;DR: Go to the Doctor. There's too many factors for strangers to help with a possible medical issue.

EDIT: Do not rule out a sleep disorder because you ""don't snore"" there are several things that it could be but again, we cannot tell you. Also, stop eating only 1k calories. You're killing yourself."

If you open up the doors to asking about things and letting them know you're going to look through stuff without it being a punishment, that's awesome and it made me feel better when I was a kid. I liked to know why I couldn't do some things, say some things, or look at things. 
You can't expect to be friends with your kids if all you do is stalk their every move. They'll remember that and they'll remember to never trust you with private information. 

Talking about your own fuck ups can prevent them from making the same mistakes, but please let them fail and mess up. Not in a horrible way, but it's trial and error and it's important.
