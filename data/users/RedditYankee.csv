Fitness,ff67bc0,t1_ff2b0pm,1579620842.0,"Accurate enough for most intents and purposes for sure, but the follow up comment is definitely useful in case someone were to extrapolate that doing heavy bench and squats wouldn’t cause any additional fatigue. Honestly this reddit thread did a good job of self sorting helpful information followed by more in depth discussion. One of the more underrated elements of reddit"
Fitness,fel59la,t1_fecdqyu,1579214349.0,Plus tendons and joints and ligaments and whatnot tend to adjust to exercise slower than muscles and cardiovascular (anecdotal broscience). Hence why it’s generally wise to ramp up intensity progressively

boston,fejrrz3,t1_fej7jjb,1579184235.0,Let’s keep Reddit out of investigations. And let’s also not blindly assume it was/wasn’t human trafficking. We have essentially zero information and anything beyond casual speculation can get ugly pretty quickly.

Fitness,fead9sh,t1_feaasvi,1578947209.0,"Most important thing with rest is listening to your body. Everyone reacts differently to stress and training, so one person's overtraining is another person's reload week. If you find yourself getting sick a lot, feeling bad, or just otherwise feeling ""off"" you're probably overtraining. Also keep in mind that it takes your body a few weeks to actually react to overtraining - my physical therapist says that it generally takes 6 weeks for injuries to start showing if you're overtraining essentially. 

&#x200B;

I've gone for stretches where I've been in the gym every single day for over a month and it generally ends in a slight/moderate injury. I don't do that anymore. Try incorporating other exercises into rest days, such as a light jog or bike ride (plus taking some days off if you can). I remind myself that overtraining means eventually I'll be \*forced\* to take days off, so taking some days off when I feel like it or it's convenient is the better approach."
college,fe69rx2,t1_fe3imaa,1578884960.0,I believe in you! I think I read somewhere that doing something for 2 weeks is enough to make it a habit. I challenge you to go to the gym every day for 2 weeks and see how you feel! Lots of great info in the wiki of /r/fitness for beginners
college,fe69o64,t1_fe2p8d0,1578884886.0,"That’s definitely rough. I go to my schools gym and while the large number of people can definitely be intimidating, everyone is more concerned with how they look than how others look. There is a small percentage of people who will put others down at the gym unfortunately, but they likely have their own problems so I wouldn’t worry about them too much. Check out /r/fitness if you haven’t already, it should help you see that everyone in the gym is there for their own reasons! Any time you see someone in the gym it’s because they also want to look and feel better :)"
college,fe0ico9,t1_fe09vh6,1578813866.0,"This is probably bland advice so forgive me if this comes off as insensitive, but I used to have more issues with panic attacks/anxiety and school and a few things helped me. The first was frequent and consistent exercise (anything which pushes your body to the limit) and the second was talking to someone while simultaneously changing locations. For me a phone call with my mom and walking down the hall or around the block has done so much for panic attacks if I’m able to catch it soon enough. 

I know everyone experiences anxiety differently and different things help different people (and my panic attacks are generally more mild than what I perceive others to be) but I saw myself in your comment and wanted to share some things which have helped me. I wish you the best of luck!!"

Fitness,fdws97p,t1_fdvx7vj,1578761883.0,This is the conclusion I came to as well when I was learning deadlifts. You don’t get as much from the negative but you can distill injure yourself. Generally when I’m doing a higher weight I’ll drop the weight either completely or I’ll keep my hands on the bar but not support it’s weight at all. Worth noting this is always on an Olympic platform with bumpers!

CFB,fcnzaom,t1_fcnh64f,1577821289.0,"Generally if you get into a top school it’s implied that you are a top achiever academically and otherwise. With relatively few exceptions, you have to be a highly gifted and ambitious individual to get into these schools. Employers understand this, and they know that hiring someone with a history degree from Harvard will likely add more value than someone with any other degree from a lesser school, like UT Austin or BU. Jokes aside, just getting into a really good school tends to lead to success because it takes a lot to get into these schools, whether it be due to your wealth, athleticism, intelligence, or likely some combo of those.

Side note: I believe some research has shown that the lifetime earnings of someone who got into Harvard but went to a lower ranked school and someone who went to Harvard are basically the same. If you’re capable of getting into Harvard, it doesn’t matter much whether or not you attend (unless your family lacks some level of connections in which case attending Harvard gets your foot in the door)."
CFB,fcnxyjr,t1_fcnxlfr,1577820615.0,"I hate this attitude. This comment is a pretty mild example on it, but especially on NFL subs people will bitch and moan about *really* harsh tackles. No, you don’t need to demolish a defenseless player and give them a concussion. No, it’s not an integral part of the game. Targeting has many issues, but there are a lot of hits which are unnecessarily rough and are hurting the game, not helping it."
