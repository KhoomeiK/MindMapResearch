And as a result, lots of people died because of this, the machines at first thought that this was because humans defined their existence through suffering, so they did the horror world next, same result, and they kept trying until finding a world that worked. (Sort of)"

The one that the movies take place in is the 23rd or so, and  the machines found the greatest success in that one.



EDIT: I have spent the last hour trying to find the original site I read this on, but to no avail. I know I remember reading stuff on it, as a spent 3 nights in a row powering through it, but it seems to have disappeared.
