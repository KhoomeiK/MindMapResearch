anchorage,fejbow5,t1_fe6ggww,1579165933.0,"Everyone suggests moose’s tooth. We get it. Try other non-tourist restaurants. Turkish Delight, Thai Siam, Ray’s Place, Hula Hands, La Cabana, Uncle Joe’s Pizza, Little Italy, Bread & Brew, Sushi & Sushi, Samurai Sushi, Pho Vietnam, China Town. Kaladi’s is good, so is Black Cup coffee. Don’t go to Gwennies unless you like non-health code passing kitchens. But their decor is cool. 

Breweries: Cynosure, 49th, Resolution Brewing, Midnight Sun Brewing, King St. Brewing. If you go to moose’s tooth, you can mix beers. I am usually a diehard IPA drinker, but 1/2 Hard Apple Ale with 1/2 Raspberry Wheat is bomb. Try it. 

Plug your car in at 20 degrees. Get a block heater. 

Moose are dicks, they’ll definitely kick you. If you’re hiking, chest holster for your handgun.
