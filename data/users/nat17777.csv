Iran formed the way it did because the US wanted a cruel man to stay in power for our national policy regardless of the will of the people. 

And we tortured them. Literally.

But hey, let’s kill more of their leaders and see if things get better

“The declassified documents explicitly state the CIA objective to replace the Iranian government in the early 1950s with a ""pro-western government under the Shah's leadership.”... These claims included such that the U.S. Officials were committing acts of violence and rape against the eastern locals. However, these accusations were never brought to justice despite United States validation on the acts. In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in 2013, the CIA confirmed its role in the coup as various documents outlining its involvement have been released to the public, most of which were previously unknown. The evidence followed by violent protests and strikes.[3] Ultimately, the United States promised to refrain from interfering with Iranian internal affairs.”

saltierthancrait,fcwpsc1,t1_fcwo5gz,1578032932.0,"I get what your saying. 

I just feel like the only “point of TLJ” and the whole series was to subvert expectations by any means necessary. 

I know the people who loved it touted the “no one is special blood lines don’t matter” and I disagreed that was implied because kylo ren was still special even if he was evil. And Because Force users were always special.

So like, saying that TLJ truly had such a main point and wasn’t really just throwing absolutely everything it could at the wall doesn’t feel right.

Yeah sure the finale broke the “crappy-fans” hearts by not supporting their takeaway. But giving TLJ even that much credit to have that point is not a stretch I’m willing to make. Ya feel?

It didn’t have a coherent or thematic point. It was movie-vomit worse than anything Lindsey Lohan expelled in mean girls or anything else. (Haha)

Edit: like why didn’t Leia die in TLJ? Why did they force her into ROS? To subvert expectations. That was their goal, their point. Anything else a means to that end. Pathetically grossly rendered. As bad if not worse than GOT."

What I think is that anything can happen wasn’t a thing.

I think it n the original series it was established in the first movie that Jedi can sense future events to some degree or another and push things around. They can also influence people which is honestly sort of fucked up morally speaking. Sith, as we learn about them then have darker versions of the same idea. Vader pushing a persons throat shut.

Palestine has lightning which is new in return, but he still might be pushing base particles so hard he creates lightning somehow. 

Force ghosts I guess stretch that a bit but w.e. Not a big deal because only force sensitives can see them. 

Still, almost everything that matters to the plot is laid out in the first movie.

In the prequels maybe anakin in conceived by the force but maybe his mom is lying or doesn’t know what really happened. Aside from that, is there anything in the prequels force wise that isn’t just the same original powers, albeit to a more nuanced degree? And like honestly it doesn’t really matter if anakin had a biological dad or not to the story.

Then the sequels where anyone can do anything and as a moviegoer I’m making predictions based on what I know. And none of it matters. Cuz the twists aren’t clever because literally anything could happen. That’s garbage. It’s not here’s an extension it’s just let’s do whatever. And that’s shit


I have frankly no idea what you’re talking about. But hey, if it’s all user specific or whatever let’s just say palpating is really the hero, a misunderstood Jedi who got hated on cuz of his user specific lightning. Cuz fuck it right. Let’s not try to make good movies where what happens could be derived from what you know but is still hard to guess due to good writing. No, let’s just fuck with expectations because that’s all that matters"
