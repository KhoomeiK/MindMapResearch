Why I ask:  I bought a shirt with (machined)  pocket embroidery.   The embroidered design forever remained a ""hard"" area in contrast to the rest of the t-shirt.   Also, whatever stabilizer backing was used made the area curl up after each washing!   In short, it looked great  when I first bought it/disappointed afterwards."

I could never make such consistent stitches by hand!!!

Either way...nicely done!!"

I do not know if this Mandarin or Cantonese or ?  Thanks for your help!

 It looks like it's missing another element originally soldered to the top cover.
Here's what it looks like:
