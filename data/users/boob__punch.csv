My600lbLife,ff6qsdq,t3_ermfps,1579632935.0,Lol I’ve lived here for like 3 years and still have never met dr now or gone by there.  I need to just buckle down and do it.
My600lbLife,fewgv7d,t1_fevezbr,1579410370.0,"i can understand it being triggering, but i don't think it's fat shaming at all.  these people have chosen to go on a weight loss journey and agreed to be filmed.  it isn't making fun of fat people (some viewers probably do but i don't think that is the shows intention.)"
My600lbLife,fewgkgh,t3_eqcwvs,1579410223.0,"for sure.  i see some of my bad habits in them.  nowhere near 600 lbs either but when they say things like ""i like eating alone so no one judges me"" or how they have a hard time saying no to cravings, it's like ""holy shit i say that too.""  food/weight issues are really tough to overcome and affect a lot more people than most realize."
