Do you have any tip as to how to read it or simply get the most out of it? Last time I attempted to read it I could barely get over the first pages."

The nature of the problem is not the other guy at question, rather your desire to stand over him. If you try to better yourself for the sole reason of comparing yourself to someone, well, if you ever manage to achieve any substantial progress, I think sooner or later you'd feel empty, and you wouldn't be satisfied with your own achievements, because your sense of fulfillment seems to be attached to surpassing this other person rather than to the process on itself. 

Meditation is pretty helpful to alleviate the process of separation of tasks, which can seem cold-blooded at first, yet I believe is essential to free oneself from outer influences like the guy you are mentioning. I think the book has a good way of introducing the stoic ideal of *Things you can control vs Things you can't control.*"
