bipolar,fcxvtgu,t1_fcxvng5,1578071265.0,The idea of running away for a bit and getting messed up is appealing but you're right.

I'm usually the complete opposite of the person I was. Looking back I may of been a bit more manic than I thought. 

I'm glad some of yours went on good uses. I did buy alot of tech devices but all are outdated by now.

I love the idea of starting a YouTube channel but I don't have the face/voice/personality for it.

Edit: wording"
AskReddit,fcxikwv,t1_fcxgihc,1578063827.0,This. My dad likes to think he's not racist but he has huge islamaphobia to the point of being very racist.

bipolar,fcnbx1m,t1_fclx54f,1577808358.0,I really want to go full blown manic at least one more time. A year without meds cost 30k but it was fucking fun but now I'm starting from the bottom again.
