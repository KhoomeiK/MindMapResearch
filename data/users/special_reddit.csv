...and to have that be the **only** thing exciting about your VP candidate is *terrible.*  

> [Superdelegates] are literally just endorsements by prominent elected officials and DNC members. 

That is very much NOT the case. Superdelegates are *not* just endorsements! In 2016, superdelegates had actual votes in the DNC convention.  This year, the DNC reduced their power, such that their votes only count in a secondary ballot, in case the first ballot doesn't provide a candidate."
politics,ffldso6,t1_ffksva0,1580038385.0,"The Republicans had 9 debates in '87-'88, when they held the White House. 

The Democrats had 9 debates in '99-'00, when they held the White House. 

When the '15-'16 season started, the DNC decided on 6 debates. SIX. Sanders' camp called for more debates, and the DNC said no. Sanders' popularity started to grow, and he continued to call for more debates. DNC said no. On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, a race in which Clinton was suddenly trailing, *she* calls for another debate and the DNC says it'll consider it. Sanders uses the opportunity to negotiate 4 more debates out of the DNC, to get to a respectable 10. 

But even then, the DNC did everything they could to make the debates matter as little as possible. The air times were ridiculous: 

One debate was scheduled at 9pm on the Sunday of a three-day weekend. Another was scheduled to be held the weekend before Christmas. Two more were also scheduled on weekends. Conversely, only 2 of the 12 Republican debates were held on weekends. 

In addition, every debate but the first was held at 8pm or 9pm Eastern time. Conversely, only 2 of the 12 Republican debates were held that late in the evening.  

And I'm not making this up on the spot. Both [Sanders and O'Malley complained about it,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/democrat-candidates-debate-schedule-clinton-sanders-omalley) but they weren't the only ones: 

Tulsi Gabbard was a vice chairwoman of the DNC that year, and [she got *booted out* because she called for more debates.](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/256640-dnc-officer-i-was-disinvited-after-call-for-more-debates) (I'm no fan of hers, but that's still a severe reaction.) 

Major outlets like Politico wondered [why debates were given low-ratings time slots.](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/democratic-debates-saturdays-215842)

As if that weren't enough, [even Nancy Pelosi thought that there should be more debates.](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/18/politics/nancy-pelosi-democrats-debates-2016/index.html)

The debates were explicitly set up by the DNC to minimize their impact on the 2016 election. That, in turn, explicitly benefit Clinton."

I don't understand, then, why you'd make such an insensitive comparison when talking about gun owners getting deported, or even *consider* gun owners getting deported. To compare your situation to people that are fighting for their lives?Deportation has *only* ever been a weapon for attacks steeped in racism.  The idea that it would somehow extend to white Americans just because they have guns is honestly mind-boggling. 

And look, I'm not advocating anyone take guns away. But the constant and endless fear of giving a little extra to help your fellow citizens is infuriating sometimes. I mean, I grew up around guns, I grew up shooting. My dad was a cop for 40 years, and he's got at least a dozen pistols and shotguns. And lemme tell you, as a private citizen he wouldn't blink at a registration program, and neither would I. There's just no reasonable damage to be done by it, I'm sorry.  Yeah, names got released a decade ago, and that ssucks, but I'm just not moved by it.  I'm down with registration, I think guns should be *way* harder to buy, and I think we need a moratorium on their manufacture. 

But it doesn't matter, Americans are too selfish to ever do things for the greater good. America still can't even see Black people as human, so why should I expect that we'd do anything about guns?


But I mean, whatever."

Um. 

What? Come on now, that can't be a serious concern. That... would never, *ever* happen in a thousand years.  How am I supposed to take this seriously, come on. 

And if this is an actual concern of yours, can I assume that you wildly pro-immigrant, pro-Dreamers and pro-DACA in your views, since you know their fear so well?"

That's not really an apt comparison. You're talking about marginalized people of color living under an administration that is openly racist and anti-immigrant. Of course they don't trust this administration, they might be thrown out of the only country they've ever called home. 

Gun owners being in a registry have no danger of deportation, of being separated from their families. A gun owner registry is much more like car registry, or having a driver's license. There's no threat to said owners."

See, here's the thing - I'm guessing you've never had the army roll into your town, armed and ready to take over. You dont know what that feels like. 

I have. I do. 

I lived in LA when the National Guard and Marines rolled through during the riots in 1992. Trust me, when you see those APCs rolling down your highway, you know how fucking real it's about to get. When you see military soldiers patrolling your street, you are afraid. If you'd seen that, you'd know this ""armed insurrection"" you're talking about is impossible. 

The fear factor alone is gonna keep some people from fighting back. And you need to understand that if soldiers are fired upon, they will fire back. Period. American citizens or not. 

So I'm not trolling - I just know that if the military is gonna roll hard on something like LA riots, they're sure as shit gonna bring down the hammer on an armed insurrection."

Or perhaps you're right. Maybe that might be too far. So maybe utilities stay on, but roads are blocked and only minimal supplies allowed through. But that might be too lenient, maybe it's something in between. 

But you need to remember - this isn't about gaining the people's support. This is about qinning a war, isn't it? If individuals have taken arms against the government, the goal is not to change their minds - the goal is to *defeat them.* They're gonna quell a rebellion by crushing it.

As for the local hospital being without power, the stores not having food... yeah, that's what a siege looks like. That's how you get people to surrender. It's cruel but effective - perfect for war.

There is nothing inherently violent about Black people. That's the point. The disparities that you see in the states of Black people and white people in America is due to the racist abuses of the American state. White people have not been forced into the living conditions that Black people have, have not been robbed of economic opportunity and earning potential the way that Black people, have not been forced into prisons the way that Black people have. It is those things (and more) that are causes, nothing inherent in Black people themselves.
