Changes in warfare rendered old forteresses obsolete, and meant that new techniques had to be invented. Tall thick stone walls used to be the stable of good fortifications, but they were vulnerable to cannons. Therefore, they were replaced with lower walls that had a gentle slope, sometimes covered in grass, which were both harder to shoot at with a canon, and much more resistant to their blows.  These walls would cover huge areas, following elaborate patterns (the classic ""star-fort"" that we see in the last picture), but from someone at ground level, they would look like little more than a small wall or an artificial hill. Not to say that renaissance and early modern military architects didn't try and male their fortifications look good - they did -, but they adopted a more ""practical"" style.

There was also an evolution in what functions a castle had to serve and was perceived as needing. Castles used to have both a military and a residential function. Its owner would want it to be both as defensive as possible, and as visually impressive as possible, inspiring both fear and awe. That changed at the end of the middle ages, with fortifications and the homes of the elites becoming two entirely different types of buildings. While fortifications were becoming more ""practical"", residences were giving up on trying to be defensible, and instead trying to be as splendid and as comfortable as they could be. For pre-existing castles, that often meant demolishing the old fortifications, and replacing them with large pavillions, that had no defensive vallue but were a much more agreable living spaces for nobility."

Scepticism towards polls is always healthy. That said, believing that mistakes made once will always repeat themselves is just as wrong as trusting them

Polling companies don't just publish the bare results of their enquiery. They edit the raw numbers compared to how the polls worked on previous elections, on how specific demographic groups tend to vote, and on other factors, to give what they believe to be the most accurate reflection of what the electorate is like at a given time. For example, it's a well known fact that people who vote for right leaning parties are less likely to say so to a polling company, which in the past has led to some serious polling mistakes. As a result, polling companies know that they need to increase the share of right-wing parties in their polls, as to be more accurate. A famous case of this is the 2002 French presidential election, where the polls infamously underestimated the share of the far-right. This led to the public believing that polls would systematically underestimate the far right... except that due to later corrections, the far-right was actually overestimated in most polls for the next decade or so (polls in the last few years having been very accurate, when it comes to France). 

For the 2016 EU referendum, it was almost inevitable that the polls would be off one way or another, because  polling companies had nothing to compare it to.  In the event of a new referendum being held, the polls will probably be more accurate, due to the simple fact that polling companies have more data and more experience.

Now, that doesn't mean that the polls for a hypothetical second referendum actually would be accurate, simply that they're more likely to be accurate. Even with large amount of data to compare their results to, polling companies still make mistakes (and UK polls are especially bad at this it seems), like when there's a change in the voter demographic that goes against what their models show. For example, in the 2017 UK election, the polls underestimated the Labour surge because the youth vote was much larger than in previous elections, something polling companies failed to predict or take in count in their estimates. 

One last important point, this only applies to polls about elections, where there will end up being verifiable evidence of whether the poll was correct or incorrect. When it comes to simple opinion questions, there's less hard data to compare it to.... and, it's another famous fact that depending on how you phrase the question, you can get your poll to say anything. Which is how we end up with polls saying that the british public simultaneously wants to get Brexit done as fast as possible *and* hold a second referendum.

This is kind of irrelevant to the point you're making, but I thought it might just be useful to go on a short rant about how polls actually work and why they're sometimes wrong."

MapPorn,fckjq3v,t1_fcjpnks,1577726831.0,">If info, what features do these lines correspond to?

I don't know what all the ligns are, but I can explain a few :

* Lign n°3, that cuts off northern France (Normandy and Picardy) from the rest is the [Joret line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joret_line), one of the principal divides among the Oïl languages. There's a few major pronounciation differences in some words, due to the languages diverging during the middle ages. For example, words south of the lign that have a ""cha"", ""ce"" or ""g"" will instead have a ""ca"", ""che"" and ""v"". People from one side of the lign could understand those on the other, but it's still a noticeable difference.
* Lign n°14, in pale blue, that cuts France horizontally, is the divide between Oïl languages to the north and Oc languages (also known as Occitan) to the south, the most historically significant divide in French languages. Their names come from the different words for ""yes"" in each language (modern ""oui"" is a variant of ""oïl""), though this is far from the only difference between them, Occitan being as a whole more similar to Catalan than to the Oîl languages.
* Lign n°20, in green, in the south west, is the divide between Gascon and the other Oc languages. Gascon is highly distinct, and there's debate if it's a variant of Occitan or a separate language in its own right. The main characteristics of Gascon are a strong basque influence, and the lack of an ""F"" sound."
MapPorn,fch7fxx,t1_fcfnym6,1577647968.0,"Probably not. Firstly, because despite what this maps may seem to show, there wasn't a clearly defined border with ""French people"" one side and ""Germans"" on the other. Rather, there was a mixture of both on either side, some being more numerous than others, with quite a few zones where there was no clear majority. Any line drawn would result in many people being on the ""wrong"" side.

Secondly, bacause most people in the area didn't fit into a neat category ; bilingualism was the norm in both societies, with peopel speaking different languages with different people, which may not be their mother tongue.

And, thirdly, because the language people actually spoke was surprisingly irrelevant, both for governments and for people themselves. Both the French and German governments wanted their respective languages to be the sole dominant language of society, but it was a well established fact that standard French/German wasn't the mother tongue of most people, but rather a standard dialect that people would later adopt. For them, what Alsatians and Lorranian spoke in their homes wasn't as important as whether they later ""integrated"" themselves into society. To a certain degree, a similar view existed among local populations, who were more attached to their local communities, religion, and historic institutions, than to an idealized ethnostate. For example, though Alsatians overwhelmingly spoke a variant of German, everything suggests that they viewed the Germans as foreign invaders and resented their annexation (the same having probably been true about the French two centuries earlier), and that they were similarly looked down upon by the Germans.

Nevermind the fact that governments generally prefer having more land over less. The French aren't going to drop the idea simply because they've been given a few ""French speaking"" scraps, and the Germans won't give up vallable land and a defensive border just because of what the people speak at home.

So not only would having the border follow language lines not solved any problems, it might even have added some."
