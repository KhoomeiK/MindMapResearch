 **People may experience:**

**Mood:** mood swings, sadness, elevated mood, anger, anxiety, apathy, apprehension, euphoria, general discontent, guilt, hopelessness, loss of interest, or loss of interest or pleasure in activities

**Behavioral:** irritability, ***risk taking behaviors***, disorganized behavior, aggression, agitation, crying, ***excess desire for sex***, hyperactivity, ***impulsivity***, restlessness, or self-harm

**Cognitive:** unwanted thoughts, ***delusion***, lack of concentration, racing thoughts, slowness in activity, or false belief of superiority

**Psychological:** depression, manic episode, agitated depression, or ***paranoia***

**Weight:** weight gain or weight loss

**Sleep:** difficulty falling asleep or excess sleepiness

**Also common:** fatigue or rapid and frenzied speaking

Some people with bipolar disorder become psychotic when manic or depressed -- for example, hearing things that aren't there. They may hold onto false beliefs, too. In some instances, they see themselves as having superhuman skills and powers -- even considering themselves to be god-like."

That being said, once I found it interesting, I'm now *fascinated* by it. I understand enough to recognize a few setups, when someone is making a mistake sometimes.

If I think I might be even a little interested, I usually give a show 3 eps before walking away.

EDIT: As for the pilot of Avenue 5, on paper it sounds like right up my alley. Space. Laurie. HBO. But I found the pilot a bit underwhelming. And 30 minutes didn't do it justice, imho. Felt a bit ""here's a few good jokes! See you next week!"" I think a 2 episode premiere would have done some good. A little more to grasp onto."
