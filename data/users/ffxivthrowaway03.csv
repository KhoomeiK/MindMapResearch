>Like descriptions of gay sex aren't to yours and many, many other straight men's.

You're making a whole lot of baseless assumptions here.  I'm going to tell you again, straight up, the fact that it's **gay** sex has literally nothing at all to do with my issue with the book or the way it's written, except for the fact that the author himself seems to be the one going above and beyond to flaunt the fact that the main character is **gay** constantly.

Gay or straight doesn't matter, it's poorly written and constantly shoehorned in to the point of being extremely awkward and offputting. The author is the one making a big deal that this character is gay, **not me**.  It's leagues beyond the sexualization in the Altered Carbon novels.

If you don't believe me, fine.  Read the book and make your own judgement, but stop trying to insist that I only have an issue with it because it's gay, which is frankly really fucking insulting, baseless, and patently untrue.  And you don't know the first thing about me or my sexuality, but you certainly jumped on the ""well you must be a straight, CIS white man because all this gay stuff makes you uncomfortable"" train real quick."

But if that's *not* what they're shooting for, then they missed the mark by a wide mile because their poster makes you think what I just described at first glance, which is ""The girl on this poster (whom is presumably a main character in the play) wouldn't know anything about slavery if it bit her in the ass, so why is she looking at me like I should be guilty about something I did to her?""

>  
>The “slave play” that incites the events of Harris’s thoroughly challenging drama takes the form of a psychology experiment, in which three interracial couples are tasked with role-playing white-black, master-slave relationships as a way to make sense of how their racial identities factor into their sex and personal lives. While the audience is first introduced to the characters in mid-19th century garb and with Southern accents of varying quality, contemporary details peek through to clarify that what we are watching is instead a modern-day performance of slave-master dynamics in the Civil War-era American South, conducted by a therapy group comprised of mixed-race couples, in service of two grad students’ thesis project.

So... all of the characters in the play are in precisely the position I assumed from the visuals on the poster.  What do the two grad student characters know about southern slavery? Or the characters tasked with acting how they *think* people in that dynamic acted back then?

Want to pay less sales tax?  Buy a more value-focused brand (which is going to save you more money even before tax comes into play).

The *real* problem with Sales Tax is that it's continually taxing the same dollar over and over into oblivion.  You buy a hot dog from me?  You pay Sales Tax on it (which I then forward to the government) *and* I pay income tax on it.  I take that dollar and then buy a piece of candy from you?  I pay sales tax on it again, then you pay income tax on it again.

I mean, that's particularly why I hate discussing this stuff around here.  It seems like the prevailing opinion is ""if you don't agree with me about something then you're wrong and you're not allowed to talk about it.""  Discussion isn't interesting if it's just two people rubbing each other off over how great they think something is.  That being said, I don't think it's that I somehow missed the entire game, but that perhaps the things you're reading into some of those scenes is more than what was actually conveyed on the screen.  Which you're right, we're not likely going to change our assessments of these games based on what either of us says here and having a discussion turn into an argument does nobody any favors.  We disagree, and that's ok!  I'm gonna leave it at that for today.

>If we're going to have a discussion, I'd much rather hear about why you do like Zestiria's development than why you don't like Berseria's; hearing why someone likes something you don't is always more interesting than hearing why they dislike something you do, and you elaborating on that might actually change my mind on Zesty, where my mind is very unlikely to change on Berseria (which I've played twice and adored both times).

I would, but given what you've said about Zestiria and how it's been completely dismissive of the entire thing makes me think that I'd just be wasting my breath as you're not receptive to even hearing me out before it devolving into ""well you're wrong and it's objectively garbage.""  I've typed it all out before in these threads and I don't have it in me to go down that road again.  I'll just leave it at this: I find it interesting that someone can seemingly find *so much* nuance in one game but find *so little* in another to the point of dismissing it entirely.

That's like... moments from the *end of the game*, and it takes the spirit of her own dead brother blatantly telling her to let it fucking go for there to be *any* growth in her character, right before her own lust for revenge was going to destroy her.  At which point it just becomes a cheesy anime trope moment as she suddenly does a complete 180, stops caring about revenge, and suddenly has a real motivation (which conveniently still has the exact same goal as she had for the entire game).  

I wouldn't really characterize that as growth or depth, it's just... awkward writing.  There's no time to heal or to grow, and there's no gradual change, as there's like two hours left in the game at that point.  The time she spent in Inominat's domain is practically nothing compared to the rest of the game where she's just blindly chasing and dramatically yelling about revenge and the shift is completely meaningless to the overall storytelling beyond fueling your typical Power of Friendship heartfelt monologue during the final boss battle."

Frankly I was expecting a *lot* more flak for my own comment as it probably came off a little harsher than I intended and anything that seems like it's even *remotely* anti-LGBT activism tends to attract a lot of negativity around reddit.  I've been called... a whole lot of things for expressing my opinions around here lol.

Honestly I'm right there with you, and that's why I responded to that comment in the first place.  I'm all for LGBT rights and people being safe and comfortable being who they are, but there's an extremely vocal subset of that community that loves to play up victimization to I dunno how to put it, harvest pity to stroke their own self esteem?  And it's not just restricted to the LGBT community, social media (and reddit's design plays heavily into this) in general is more or less all about people seeking validation, and people will latch onto anything to clutch their pearls over fishing for people to run to their defense just to feel better about themselves, and then that further encourages SJWs to start white knighting stuff, then the hate parties start commenting, and any chance of civil discourse quickly dissolves into the two extremes duking it out over the ashes.

It's a shame it's so easy for people to buy into outrage culture, because it *legitimately* hurts the message a lot of these social and civil rights movements are trying to make.  The overzealous and hangers-on end up doing far more damage to the cause than they do good, and just give fuel to the negativity of those who oppose it.
