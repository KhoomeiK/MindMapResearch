Moviesinthemaking,ffbe6ja,t1_ffb9bb1,1579761483.0,"Assuming you’re not joking here are some Oldsmobile facts (I don’t know why I’ve always felt such brand loyalty to a company that was discontinued before I even got my license, but many of my favorite cars are Oldsmobiles so I’ve learned a lot of random facts over the years):

- Oldsmobile was the oldest American car company at the time of their demise and one of the oldest car companies in the world, having been established in 1897.

- Oldsmobile invented the concept of the automotive assembly line (Ford always gets the credit for that but Ford’s real innovation was the *moving* assembly line with stationary workers).

- Thanks to that innovation the Curved Dash Oldsmobile was the first mass produced gasoline car in the world.

- Ransom E. Olds, the creator and namesake of the company, left in 1904 to form the truck company REO. You know, the company that built the REO Speed Wagon that some band was later named after...

- The first pop song ever written about a car was “In My Merry Oldsmobile” from 1905

- The first fully automatic transmission was the Oldsmobile Hydramatic offered in 1939 for the 1940 model year. It would take a decade or more for some competitors to come up with their own automatic transmissions, and as a result for many years you could buy a Lincoln or several other non-GM brands with a Hydramatic.

- The first “modern” OHV V8 engine in the USA was the Oldsmobile Rocket in 1949. It was so advanced that the same basic engine was used with minor design changes until the 1990 model year. Unlike the V8s of competitors the Oldsmobile Rocket was designed with an eye towards efficiency and low emissions, which is how it was able to pass strict emissions and fuel economy regulations until 1990, the only carbureted V8 that was able to do so.

- Many consider the first rock and roll song to be “Rocket 88” from 1951, which was about an Oldsmobile 88.

- The first mass produced turbocharged car in the world was the 1962 Oldsmobile Cutlass.

- The 1964 Oldsmobile 4-4-2 was arguably the first true muscle car, putting a full-size engine into a midsize car. Most other muscle cars didn’t come out until a year or two later.

- The 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado was the first mainstream American car with front wheel drive. In order to ensure that there were no flaws with the design that could potentially hurt sales the front wheel drive system was massively overengineered, to the point that later it was used with almost no changes to power the 26 foot long GMC Motorhome (I see some differing reports that the Motorhome used an Oldsmobile engine or a Cadillac engine, but either way the overall design of the system and transmission was all Oldsmobile).

- Oldsmobile, alongside Cadillac and Buick, was the first to offer airbags in a production car. In 1974. Speed-sensitive dual-stage driver *and passenger* airbags with integrated knee protection. In 1974. ACRS was a groundbreaking but ultimately unpopular and unsuccessful option, and when the smaller full-sized cars were introduced in 1977 in response to the fuel crisis many of the innovations of the early 1970s like airbags disappeared.

- The 1980s Oldsmobile Toronado offered a touchscreen computer infotainment system as an option.

- In the 1980s, while Oldsmobile had largely become synonymous with reliable but boring family cars, they also built the Aerotech: a purpose-built mid-engine experimental supercar that set speed and economy records and could go 267mph (faster than a Bugatti Veyron). It was powered by an Oldsmobile Quad 4 inline four cylinder, highly customized and tuned but basically the same engine that powered their economy cars.

- In 1988 the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme was chosen as the pace car for the Indianapolis 500. One of the features of that car was the world’s first automotive heads-up display. Originally intended as a gimmick for the pace car the public response was so strong that they made it an optional feature on the production model, decades before it would become common on other cars.

- The 1990 Oldsmobile Bravada was arguably the first luxury SUV. Earlier models like the Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Range Rover had started the trend, but those weren’t purpose-built luxury cars, they were originally utility vehicles that slowly moved upmarket. It was also the first truck-based vehicle offered by a brand that had traditionally only sold cars since before WWII, a trend that would become increasingly common a decade later.

- The Oldsmobile Silhouette was the first luxury minivan, a segment which never really took off like luxury SUVs did but remains a popular niche.

- Oldsmobile developed the Northstar V8, GM’s first truly modern DOHC V8. Despite that it was primarily used in Cadillacs, the only Oldsmobile to ever receive the Northstar (a slightly smaller version that wasn’t branded as a Northstar) was the Aurora, the car that gets jumped on in The Matrix Reloaded.

- The 1995 Oldsmobile 88 was the first car to offer a factory GPS system in the USA.

Since the majority of Oldsmobiles were luxury cars and family sedans they got a reputation as a boring and unimaginative company, but throughout their century-long history they were one of the most innovative and groundbreaking car companies in the world."
Moviesinthemaking,ffb7wf8,t1_ffap8in,1579754386.0,"One little detail I’ve always loved is how many Oldsmobiles were in that chase scene. GM did a lot of product placement in that scene and while a lot of other popular models are featured (like the Cadillac CTS that the main characters drive, along with an Escalade, Chevys, Saturns, Pontiacs, etc) there are a disproportionately high number of Oldsmobiles on that road. I’m pretty sure the every single Oldsmobile offered at the time of the movie makes an appearance, along with a few older Oldsmobiles in the background, and many of the stunt vehicles are Oldsmobiles (in addition to the one that gets jumped on in slow motion, one of the most iconic scenes of the trilogy).

Oldsmobile as a brand was discontinued in 2003 for the 2004 model year and by that point half the lineup had already been discontinued. When this movie was made Oldsmobile was already dead in the water, they had announced the decision years in advance and pretty much all further development, marketing, advertising, etc had stopped and sales plummeted. Even before that GM had completely destroyed Oldsmobile’s reputation and market share via a botched rebrand (with ads proclaiming “not your father’s Oldsmobile”, ignoring the century-long legacy of Oldsmobiles being innovative, fun, and well built cars).

There was really no incentive for them to give so much screen time to a brand that only had a few months left and was already irrelevant to much of the public. The Aurora and Intrigue (the two with the most screen time) would have already been discontinued by the time of the movie’s release with just a few left on dealer lots and the rest (which really only appeared in the background) would be gone in less than a year. But for a brief moment GM put the company back in the spotlight in one of the biggest blockbusters of the year and imagined a world where Oldsmobile was still the most popular brand in the country.

Then again since the most visible Oldsmobiles in the movie were the ones getting completely demolished maybe it was an intentional decision. Put prominent GM cars front and center to get the most out of their product placement, but also save any of the big sellers from getting damaged on-screen."

SequelMemes,ff4d0g5,t1_ff3m0s7,1579560715.0,"Counterpoint: PG-13 didn’t exist until movies like Gremlins pointed out how flawed the rating system was, and profanity was one of the biggest complaints parents had.

Up until the late 1960s movies had to follow the “Hays code” which had significant content restrictions on movies shown in mainstream theaters, pretty much limiting every movie to roughly PG. This was protested and lawsuits were filed, so to avoid government intervention the MPAA developed a more open rating system that simply acted as a rough guideline for people to make their own decisions. When movie ratings were implemented there were four ratings: G, M (later changed to GP and then PG), R, and X.

- G was basically the same as G today, maybe a bit less strict like allowing a few mild curse words.

- M/GP/PG covered the vast majority of movies, from otherwise G-rated movies with mild cartoon-like violence to stuff that wouldn’t even be allowed in PG-13 movies today. It was kind of a useless rating for parents because it didn’t give any meaningful information about whether the movie was suitable for children or just teenagers.

- R was like R today, except maybe even a bit more explicit since today’s PG-13 movies allow less than M/GP/PG did.

- X was a real rating back then, basically just used like a “hard R” (think Quentin Tarantino movies) but they didn’t trademark it like they did with the others so anyone could self rate their content as X without going through the MPAA and it quickly lost all meaning and gained a bad reputation. Later it was replaced with NC-17.

So a couple decades have passed since that rating system was put in place. It’s now the mid-‘80s and violent/profanity-laden movies aimed at teens are exploding in popularity. Parents are at their wits end because G seems like a baby rating that their kids don’t like but PG can mean anything from something fit for elementary schoolers to something approaching an R rating. Enter PG-13. They basically split the PG rating in half, with the lighter half remaining PG and the more explicit stuff getting its own rating of PG-13. In the early days PG-13 went quite a bit farther than it does now, overlapping significantly with R, and even the new PG allowed far more profanity than we see today (for example Back to the Future is filled with “basic cable” profanity and Spaceballs has an F-bomb despite both being rated PG and released after PG-13 existed).

But there has been a definite shift over the past couple decades as PG-13 has been getting stricter and stricter. Originally you could have a handful of F-bombs in a PG-13 movie, and some movies can still get away with two or three, but depending on the context these days one can be enough to get an R rating. Violence has also been toned down quite a bit compared to the ‘80s. PG-13 doesn’t really mean anything anymore, in most cases it just feels like PG for middle schoolers instead of elementary schoolers.

This is because PG-13 has become *the* hot rating that every new movie aims for, it’s the perfect target rating for something that isn’t necessarily a kids movie but doesn’t turn people off like R does. But that means that it’s much more appealing to children, and that means that parents who don’t pay attention to ratings get upset when the PG-13 movie is too explicit for their 9-year-old, so the MPAA bows to public pressure and lowers the threshold, which makes it more mainstream, which makes parents think it’s suitable for kids, and on and on and on.

Right now we kind of have the opposite problem of what we did in the ‘80s, with seemingly very little difference between PG and PG-13 while R spans the increasingly wide gap from mildly inappropriate for children to extremely explicit. I wouldn’t be surprised if another restructuring is in the future, maybe something like splitting PG-13 into a softer PG-10 along with something that more fits the original spirit of PG-13 and takes some of the stress off of R, or even abandon PG-13 entirely in favor splitting R into a softer R-14 and a more explicit R-17. Or maybe even a completely new system that abandons age recommendation in favor of content indicators that allow parents to decide for themselves what kind of content they’re ok with. But then again with the rise in video streaming platforms the traditional MPAA ratings are slowly being replaced by TV ratings or proprietary ratings that the services themselves come up with, so we might be stuck with the increasingly broken system for the foreseeable future.

TL;DR there’s a lot more to PG-13 than one F-bomb, that just happens to be where it ended up today."

Sticks are nice and all but they’re absolute *garbage* for precision aiming, gyro aim takes a few minutes to get used to but once you do it’s much quicker and more accurate. Nintendo has fully embraced gyro aim on all their consoles for over a decade now, the PC crowd loves it, and PlayStation has had the option for as long as Nintendo has, although most developers ignore it. The only thing keeping it from being universal at this point is Xbox, and that might change with this new console."

Showerthoughts,ff3aapz,t1_ff369bf,1579537299.0,I have one from the ‘90s and it’s definitely optical. [Here’s an ad from around 1995 talking about the optical tracking](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CBhTEObtJgM/S6YXkzRrmTI/AAAAAAAAUp4/sJ8TE-oQFyQ/s1600/03.11%2Btrackman%2B600.jpg).
Showerthoughts,ff2doyy,t1_ff1kt3e,1579501932.0,"I use a Logitech trackball, the thumb-controlled one that used to be called the Trackman and now MX Ergo, it’s by far my favorite style of pointing device and it allows for an amazing level of precision in design work. Those have been optical since the very first models back in the ‘90s or whenever it was, that’s why they had that iconic polka dot red trackball and why the new laser tracking modes use sparkly metallic trackballs. There’s a little optical sensor inside that looks at the ball to determine movement, with no mechanical wheels like an old mouse.

But if you use one for a few months you’ll slowly start to notice that it doesn’t seem as precise or smooth as it used to be, and eventually it might start sticking, ruining your precision. As it turns out despite being optical they still need to be cleaned, but unlike the rollers in an old mouse it just has three tiny plastic ball bearings that suspend the trackball so that it doesn’t touch any other part of the housing and can roll freely. These rollers will get a little glob of dust on them after a while, but all it really takes to clean them is to touch them with your finger tip and they fall right off. None of the scraping you had to do with old mice, no digging around inside the mouse to try to spin the wheels to a new position, just wipe your finger across the three bearings and you’re back to work.

Honestly there’s nothing like cleaning one of those trackballs. It takes a couple of seconds to do and afterward the ball just glides like magic, it’s so smooth with practically zero friction, and the weight of the ball lets it spin so nicely. But it’s a feeling you can only experience if you neglect it and don’t keep it perfectly clean all the time, because otherwise it just works that well all the time and you stop noticing it."

9 basically just went “you like these references? Palpatine said the meme line, Chewie gets a medal, Reylo is canon now!

todayilearned,fezsdje,t1_fezd5i9,1579461036.0,"The standard plan is the one that used to be bundled with DVDs, so that’s what most people are on. Two simultaneous streams at 1080p for something like $13 per month last I checked. I think for an extra $1-2 per month you can get HDR content at 1080p, and 4K with 4 simultaneous streams is $16 per month. Then at some point they introduced an ultra-basic plan that only offers one stream at a time at standard definition, but even that one keeps going up in price, I think it’s now $9 per month and even on a smartphone the difference in picture quality is noticeable and it really feels like a ripoff."
todayilearned,fezrfbe,t1_feyqu6s,1579460696.0,"Netflix hasn’t quite realized that people want *quality* shows like that, or they’ve decided that lowest common denominator stuff sells better. They do offer traditional sitcoms but they’re all bottom-of-the-barrel laugh track shows. The closest they’ve come to something like The Office is probably Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, but that one’s already over and nothing has come along to replace it. That’s really the biggest problem with streaming services as a whole, they always either ignore comedy entirely or focus solely on bleak comedy-dramas with linear narratives. Those are good too, but they’re overdone at this point and they’re no replacement for traditional sitcoms. But at the moment traditional TV is still the only place to find good comedy shows."
todayilearned,fez3kd0,t1_feyomxf,1579453564.0,"Yeah people saying it would be fine if they raised the price apparently haven’t noticed that they’ve raised the price so many times in recent years. I was a Netflix subscriber for a decade but when they started dropping all their shows and raising the price I went from a full time subscriber to once or twice a year to catch up on stuff. They’re not even worth the price they’re asking anymore, let alone a price increase.

The last time I got a month of Netflix I had to drop down to the standard definition plan because the default plan has gotten too expensive to justify, even Hulu’s cheapest $5.99 plan offers full HD, with 4K and HDR on some of their originals at no extra charge. Netflix not only charges extra for 4K but even 1080p, that’s just absurd in 2020. I don’t even need multiple screens, just make the single screen standard definition plan have 1080p and 4K at no extra charge and I’d come back, but they need that artificial limitation because otherwise almost no one would pay for the 2 or 4 screen plans and they’d lose even more money.

I’ll honestly be surprised if Netflix is still a major player in five or ten years, they’ve been coasting on their old reputation for like five years now and it’s getting harder and harder to justify paying for it. They wanted to be HBO so badly that they didn’t stop to think that most people either “borrow” someone else’s HBO password or sign up for one month at a time, but unlike HBO Netflix doesn’t have cable bundles to keep them afloat."
gaming,fexcomv,t1_fewr71w,1579428738.0,"That’s definitely the case.

I got one when they were $5 and I got the original Half-Life for 99¢ in the same sale. I thought Half-Life would be the perfect test for the Steam Controller, since I’d never played the first one before, it’s by Valve, and it was never designed for controllers. Throughout pretty much the entire game (I play those kinds of games pretty slow so probably like 30 hours) I was almost constantly pausing to adjust the controller settings. Fine tuning certain settings, learning new features, deciding I didn’t like the settings I had set up, etc. by the end of the game I had it tuned *perfectly*, it felt amazing and far more capable than any controller I’ve ever used.

But that’s the problem, it was at the *end* of the game that I finally had everything the way I wanted it. I haven’t had time to really play through another game yet, I just briefly tried a handful of other games for a few minutes each, hopefully I will be able to take most of the settings I’ve fine tuned and transfer them to the next game but every game will require a bit of customization to really make the most use of it. One of the best aspects of the Steam Controller is the community support, no matter what game you try you’ll find at least a dozen or so controller profiles available with one or two as the clear community favorite, but the problem with those is that everyone is going to have slightly different preferences so you’d still have to tweak them a lot.

Also a really annoying aspect, which is by no means a problem with the controller itself, is that a large percentage of the games I’ve tried allow either controller *or* keyboard and mouse, but not both. My preference is to use the analog stick for movement, so the ideal setup would be to map it as a normal controller for the most part with the touch pad and gyro mapped to mouse aim, but in many games you would have to choose between precision mouse aiming or precision analog directional movement, you can’t have both. Mapping the analog stick to WASD does *work*, but it’s noticeably worse than a true analog stick.

Still, after only using it for that one game I’m already a huge fan of the controller and I’m really bummed out that there won’t be any future versions and that I’ll probably never be able to find another cheap one in the future."
videos,feuust2,t1_feumz7x,1579390164.0,"Sure, but that ignores the main point I’m making, which is that the fundamental way that a Flash animation works is entirely different from video.

In video, at its most basic, you get a series of images that are displayed one after the other in sequence, synchronized with an audio file, to create the illusion of movement. More advanced video codecs might use compression algorithms to interpolate frames between key frames by smudging the image, but there are still a series of images played in sequence.

If you dig through a Flash file for Homestar Runner or something you will not find anything that remotely looks like what you see on the screen. All that is contained inside is vector instructions for how to draw the lines that make up the characters and backgrounds and what color they should be, along with instructions on what position and shape they should be at different times. Even if you could view the contents as the software sees them it would just be an assortment of pieces, like legs, torsos, eyeballs, *maybe* an entire background image if the background is static and doesn’t have any movement, but no images that resemble any final scene of the animation. The computer then takes this information and creates the images in real time, it’s not displaying images that already exist like video does. This is how it’s possible to change the scaling and play an unmodified Homestar Runner short from the original webpage in 4K, or interact with Flash animations in real time, or change the aspect ratio or remove characters and look outside of the boundaries of the animation, the information was already there and the computer is simply re-creating the scene based on instructions it receives."
videos,feuc3t8,t1_fet3nji,1579385167.0,"It was a Flash *animation*, not a Flash video.

A Flash video is simply a Flash application that contains video, eliminating the need for separate plugins or downloading, like what you got from YouTube and Hulu and other streaming services in the early days. Flash animations operate on a fundamentally different principle that cannot reasonably be described as “video”, a Flash animation simply contains a descriptions of shapes and time markers along with an audio track and then the animation is assembled and performed in real time on the viewer’s computer.

It’s true that the distinction no longer really exists, since these days most Flash animations are rendered to video and distributed via video, but that only became common years after YouTube came along and smartphones and tablets stopped supporting Flash."
videos,fetec3n,t1_fes4jq3,1579374532.0,"Yeah, people don’t really make that distinction anymore since everything is served via video platforms these days but viral animations were very different and much more popular back in the old days.

Viral videos existed back then, but before high-speed internet and embedded video streaming they were more of a P2P technology, you had to download them to your computer and people shared them by emailing them to each other or hosting them on their own website, you didn’t have a central source where you would find videos. When something was really worth watching it would still spread like wildfire, but it took so much more effort than today so it wasn’t as common.

By comparison Flash animation required very little bandwidth (most of it was just audio, depending on compression a whole animation might be kilobytes in size), it required very little skill or equipment apart from a pirated copy of Flash MX, and allowed for much larger and more detailed images than internet video ever could. It didn’t require any downloads and could be hosted on either dedicated sites or community sites, all you needed to do was go to a website and let the animation load for like 20 seconds and you were ready to watch.

Once high speed Internet, video streaming, and high-quality smartphone cameras came along the barriers to internet video were completely eliminated and suddenly animation was the more difficult and niche format, and viral videos exploded in popularity, but before that animation was king."

Later series seem like a competition to see who can be the most horrific or violent, who can be the most zany or outlandish, who can come up with the most convoluted lore and interwoven crossovers. Constantly pushing the boundaries of established canon and stretching suspension of disbelief to its breaking point.

By comparison series 1 just had lots of just plain *weird* ones. Those are by far my favorite. They still show up from time to time but seemingly not at the frequency they used to.

The nationwide broadcast networks are NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, the CW, and PBS. All of those are pretty much guaranteed to be freely available in any reasonably sized town or city. Then there are a few nationwide syndication networks like My Network TV, which are available in most areas but exclusively air reruns with no original programming, as well as some nationwide foreign language networks like Telemundo and Univision. Then the rest of the channel lineup (which tends to outnumber the major networks) is regional networks, syndication, local programming, or things like infomercials or home shopping, and what is offered varies from city to city.

All of the major networks (and most of the local minor channels too) also offer sub-channels, which is a feature of over-the-air digital television, so for example one network might have five channels: the main national network feed plus a time shifted channel airing alternate programming, a foreign language channel, an audio-only channel, and a kid-friendly channel. These sub-channels are pretty much always in standard definition to save on bandwidth with significantly lower production quality than the main channel, some even look like 240p YouTube streams. This is what makes up most of the channel lineup, you might have the six national networks plus a few of the smaller networks and 10-20 local channels, but when each has at least a couple sub-channels and possibly as many as ten sub-channels the total number goes up dramatically."

I think the early aerodynamic styling was hard for people to swallow after a lifetime of cars that were purely designed for aesthetics, but deep down they were basically still *designed*, they still had traditional proportions and aesthetic flourishes, they just happened to be designed with rounded corners and flush trim. But the shapes of today’s cars are almost entirely dictated by aerodynamics with almost zero room for aesthetics apart from the shapes of lights and the grille. Add to that that the ideal aerodynamic shape of a family car is extremely unflattering and unappealing (roughly the shape of a Prius), and now even a once “boring” shape like the Thunderbird looks downright sleek and stylish compared to modern cars.

The one that really gets me (although I do remember it being somewhat “cool” back in the day too) is the [last-generation Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme](http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/1/605/1661/1510830045_large.jpg). It must have been absolutely wild to see one of those on the road in 1988, compared to even other aerodynamic cars of the time like the Taurus it must have looked like an out-of-this-world concept car. By the time I was in high school they were just a boring old car that you saw everywhere, nothing particularly exciting or notable. But looking back now I think it might be my favorite design of the 1980s-1990s, the way it manages to combine those ‘90s-futuristic touches like hidden door handles and wraparound greenhouse with old fashioned touches like the two tone paint and classic Oldsmobile styling cues, it just works so well and looks so unique. I’d love to get one and do an electric drivetrain swap."

NintendoSwitch,fedwukq,t1_fedhrw4,1579021577.0,"Here’s my zany pipe dream that probably won’t come true:

With Half-Life Alyx it would seem Valve is finally ready to get back into game development. They’ve already said that depending on the reaction that Alyx gets they’re interested in returning to the Half-Life series more in the future, which fans have taken to mean Half-Life 3 is back on the table. But that’s a problem for me. Half-Life and Half-Life 2 are both amazing and groundbreaking games, but they’re so dramatically different and they’re both products of their times in many ways. If Half-Life 3 picks up where Half-Life 2: Episode 2 left off it won’t really *feel* like a proper Half-Life 3, it needs to be a standalone game with an entirely new story and potentially new gameplay mechanics that set it apart from Half-Life 2 and make it feel unique.

So it’s time for The Orange Box 2. This time it would contain all of the games from the original, along with the first Half-Life and Portal 2. Plus two new small games, Half-Life 2: Episode 3 and some kind of Portal game. These would be very short games, say 4-6 hours, like the original Half-Life episodes and Portal. The idea would be to reset people’s expectations while giving them the sequel they’ve been waiting over a decade for and wrapping up the Half-Life 2 storyline to open the doors for something entirely new with Half-Life 3. And if it’s a flop and people don’t like the plot at least they didn’t “ruin” Half-Life 3 and they can still start fresh. Plus, since it seems like Valve is mainly interested in VR going forward, this could be a kind of swan song for them (although I feel like if Portal is to ever have another direct sequel it would *need* to be a traditional game, it’s mostly centered on movement and death-defying stunts so I don’t see how it could possibly work in VR).

Apart from the new games (which would presumably be made in Source 2 but could maybe be ported to Source) there shouldn’t be any issue running them all at full quality/resolution/frame rate on the Switch. Storage wouldn’t be an issue on other consoles with their blu-day drives, but the Switch release might require a 32 or 64GB card, but it could still be done.

Unfortunately, although I’ve been dreaming about this idea for years, Alyx kind of throws a wrench into that. It will now serve as the “reset”, to give fans something new to play that isn’t Half-Life 3, and it will likely also be that entirely new concept in gaming that Half-Life 3 would be in my idea. Still, it seems inevitable that Alyx will become the first true killer app of VR and be the system-selling game that Myst was for CD-ROM, so Valve is bound to start looking at Half-Life 3 some time soon. But I still really hope that it doesn’t continue the story from Half-Life 2, and I also hope that Half-Life 2’s story gets wrapped up eventually. Episode 3 would be a perfect and elegant solution to that problem, and a new Orange Box would be a perfect and elegant way to release it."

/s sort of, but really that’s the whole reason they became so popular and successful in the first place, undercutting everyone on price. It’s nice to talk about sticking it to the man and supporting local businesses, but I and most of the rest of the country simply can’t *afford* to do that, each dollar saved really adds up. Not to mention that Amazon’s business model allows them to keep an exponentially larger stock of variety and niche items than any local store ever could, do you never have to worry about whether you’ll be able to find what you’re looking for. When I shop locally it’s either because the prices are lower or because it’s something that I really want to the point that I’m willing to pay a little extra to not have to wait.

Luckily now that they’ve had a taste of making actual profit  and they’ve branched out to more and more products and services it’s becoming harder and harder for Amazon to keep their position as the cheapest option. These days when comparing prices Amazon often falls behind not just other websites but local stores, so it’s becoming easier to avoid using them. Also in my case Amazon does charge sales tax now (maybe because they have warehouses in-state?) so that extra perk is gone too.

But the core problem supporting businesses like Amazon and Walmart is that thanks to sheer scale and shady practices they can afford to charge less than anyone else. That is literally the only thing that matters for most people, and no amount of exposing their corruption will ever change that. If we could afford to shop elsewhere there wouldn’t be an Amazon in the first place."

NintendoSwitch,fdosmvx,t1_fdopewk,1578611973.0,"Just a warning though, I’m not completely finished with my build yet so there’s a chance I might be wrong about something, but so far it’s looking very promising.

The computer I’m using is an Optiplex 7010 minitower with an i7 3770 (many VR games recommend various i5s like the 7500, this CPU is much older but benchmarks 20% higher than that processor). I started with a GeForce GTX 770 as the graphics card and I knew that was probably going to be a problem, since it’s older than the minimum recommended GPU for any VR games or headsets, but benchmark scores are almost identical to the 1050Ti which many games list as the minimum requirement.

At the moment that setup really does work. I haven’t tested a ton of games yet, but stuff like the Windows Mixed Reality hub, Super Hot VR, Euro Truck Simulator 2, and various movie theater simulators all work perfectly, with good picture, high frame rate, and no lag. But The Lab and oddly enough the Steam VR hub are completely unplayable, with extremely low framerates and tons of lag.

So my new plan is to get a GTX 1660 Super some time soon, as it should handle any VR game adequately without breaking the bank, plus it has 6GB of GDDR6. I’m a little nervous about that since one of those cards costs more than I’ve spent on the *entire system* up to this point, but from all the research I’ve done it sounds like that plan should work and nothing else should stop the computer from running flashy VR games like Half-Life.

One other thing to consider: while the board and case use a normal ATX layout there is one significant incompatibility. Technically any graphics card can be made to fit, but an extra long card (like my GTX 770) requires the removal of the hard drive cage which means several rivets need to be drilled out. A long card will also cover the port where the front panel USB ports plug in, so you’ll lose those (but the indicator lights and audio jacks plug in elsewhere so those will still work). Some cards will also partially cover the SATA ports so you’ll probably want to use a 90° SATA cable to avoid putting strain on the port. But any shorter card (like around 200mm or less) should fit without having to make any modifications or unplugging anything. The 1660 Super I’m looking at, for example, is only 176mm long, so that card will fit without any issues."
NintendoSwitch,fdooqsk,t1_fdnej4y,1578609511.0,"It’s not exactly *cheap*, but my budget solution was to base my VR build on an old i7 business computer. I went with a Dell Optiplex because the older models are industry-standard ATX for the most part and if you’re patient and check local computer recyclers you can find the computers for around $100. The 7010/9010 (Ivy Bridge) and 7020/9020 (Haswell) minitower models with an i7 will comfortably surpass the minimum requirements for VR, offer a decent 32GB RAM ceiling, and are pretty much entirely standard mATX (unlike many other business desktops that look like ATX at first glance but use things like proprietary power connectors or low power PCIe slots) so they’re easy enough to upgrade.

Unfortunately there is *very* little information out there on which computers use standard ATX and which use proprietary connectors, along with which can handle high-powered graphics cards, so you need to do a lot of research to avoid making the wrong purchase.

There’s no getting around the requirement for a $200-ish graphics card and an aftermarket power supply, plus the cost of a headset (the Samsung HMD Odyssey+ is a very good value, sometimes going on sale for as low as $200 but with the same resolution as the Valve Index). But with some luck and determination it’s possible to put together a VR rig for around $600-700 all-in (including headset). And as a bonus anything capable of VR should also handle 1080p gaming on ultra settings without breaking a sweat, with many games performing well at 1440p."
sbubby,fdm3ed5,t1_fdm0ub7,1578538859.0,"Not necessarily, just that the often-repeated claim that subscribing to every streaming service is cheaper than cable/satellite completely ignores the fact that you get way more shows and channels from TV services than you do from streaming services.

And while some streaming services do have cable shows they usually don’t get added until a year or more after they air and a lot of them simply aren’t available to stream anywhere without a cable subscription.

NintendoSwitch,fdfo41w,t1_fdds2rq,1578366184.0,"I know everyone wants a Switch Pro, but here’s my unsubstantiated prediction: a TV-only console to complement the portable-only Lite. That way people who want to play Mario, Zelda, Smash, etc but can’t justify the price tag can finally try it out and people who already own a Switch can get one for every TV in the house. The basic hardware is simple enough and pretty much all the stuff that makes the Switch expensive is the stuff that makes it portable, so I could see it being profitable somewhere around $100 for the bare console for existing owners and maybe $150 bundled with a Pro controller. Knowing Nintendo they might not be willing to sell a system without their usual markup, but it could be done.

And with a standalone TV console they wouldn’t need to throttle the processor, they could run it at the full design speed full-time and release updates with improved visuals/performance for games that don’t run natively at 1080p or 60fps. Think of it as a trial run for the Switch Pro while also giving existing owners an incentive to buy one, without any need for re-engineering or extra cost.

Seriously, though, I think that with a standalone TV model with a $100-150 price point they could potentially see Wii-like sales by the end of the generation. The most common complaint I see about the Switch is that it’s overpriced and underpowered, and the Lite has shown that Nintendo doesn’t seem interested in lowering the price without making significant hardware compromises, but at that price point even a lot of people who already have a PlayStation or Xbox (or kids who can’t convince their parents to buy a Switch) would probably be interested.

I’m not saying I think it’s *likely* that this is what they’re talking about, just that it would be a good idea."

The brilliant move they made was to introduce the stupidly named “extra most bestest” which has extra cheese and pepperoni for $6. By comparison now the base $5 pizza tastes bland and unappealing, there’s certainly the chance that they took the opportunity to reduce the amount of cheese and pepperoni but the $5 pizza definitely never tasted as good as this $6 one does. So now even though they *offer* a $5 pizza I’ll happily pay the extra dollar for the better one.

My guess is that they simply have no choice if they want to stay competitive. Fast food pizza chains have started to come down on price lately, usually offering some sort of discount for pickup or regular promotional deals. For example Pizza Hut offers medium single topping pizzas for $5 and Domino’s offers medium 2 topping pizzas for $6, both of which are the same 12” size as Little Caesar’s. Even my cheap location already priced themselves out of the market for premium pizzas, for example their 12” 3 meat is now $9 which is more than Domino’s $8 for a 14” 3 topping. All of these are carry out specials, not the default pricing, but Little Caesar’s doesn’t do delivery so it’s a fair comparison.

At this point Little Caesar’s main appeal is not even the price anymore so much as the convenience, you can get the same deal if not better at other chains but at those you can’t just pull up to the drive thru and get one at a moment’s notice.

It’s no masterpiece by any stretch, but there are worse ways to kill an hour and a half. Go in with low expectations and you might actually enjoy it, but if you go in thinking it’s some hidden gem you’ll definitely be disappointed."
gadgets,fcgo4kg,t3_eh5bzn,1577642309.0,"What would be really great (but a long way off in terms of technology, if not completely impossible to implement) would be some kind of universal standard charging port/location on all electric cars that could be paired with some kind of automatic coupler. This is such a specific yet wide-ranging idea that I can’t even picture how it could work, but if there was some technology where parking your car in a designated spot would automatically start charging it, without posing any risk to pedestrians or non-electric vehicles, it could revolutionize the way we charge cars and practically eliminate one of the biggest roadblocks to electric car adoption (limited range and long recharge times).

I understand that this article is more about parking the car and going inside, but the vast majority of fast food is sold via the drive thru. Ideas like mobile phone ordering are quickly taking off and in my experience curbside pickup is far quicker, easier, and reduces risk of error. You’re usually only in the spot for like 5-10 minutes, not enough to justify getting out of the car to plug it in (especially when it’s especially hot, cold, or raining), but if the car could plug itself in that would be a huge boost in convenience. But it doesn’t just need to be tied to fast food. Imagine that technology applied to grocery stores, pharmacies, shopping malls, restaurants, hotels, even your own garage. Simply parking the car during daily errands could potentially add dozens if not hundreds of miles to the range and for a lot of people might completely eliminate the need to plug the car in at all.

The problem with this idea of course is that it would need to be something universal that is shared by all manufacturers, it needs to be extremely robust and long-lasting, it needs to be completely safe and foolproof, and it needs to be cheap to implement, which might not be possible in the real world. And on top of that there’s the question of who pays for the electricity, and if it’s the driver some sort of automatic payment system would need to be worked out. But if it could be done it would be a total game changer."

megalophobia,fc9wfnz,t3_egqe5n,1577559197.0,"It kind of should be. It’s not just the tallest building, it’s the tallest building by a ridiculously wide margin that seems like it should be impossible.

It has also had the weird effect that it has completely overshadowed other recent supertall skyscrapers. Ask an average person what the second tallest building is after Burj Khalifa and they might point to one of the previous record holders, like Taipei 101, the Petronas twin towers, or the Sears Tower. But there are now like ten buildings between Taipei 101 and the Burj Khalifa, if it hadn’t been built the record for tallest skyscraper would have changed hands almost yearly for the past decade. But it’s just so absurdly tall that any new supertall building just doesn’t even come close.

The difference between the Burj Khalifa and the next tallest building is almost 300 meters or 700 feet, and when it was built it was over 400m or 1,000ft taller than the next tallest building. If you don’t live in a major metropolitan area chances are the tallest skyscraper in your city would fit on top of the second tallest building in the world without reaching the height of the Burj Khalifa. If you put the Empire State Building *on top of the Sears Tower* it still wouldn’t be the tallest building in the world. It’s really tall."

Also I’m having a hard time picturing how this happened, as the fender should be solid metal while the bumper is plastic."

NintendoSwitch,fc0c06r,t1_fbzy2v3,1577286415.0,"I’ll be honest and admit to being the kind of person who buys those 50¢ games, and some of them turn out to be surprisingly good, but it’s *so annoying* to google all of them to figure out which ones aren’t garbage. Especially the games that are Switch exclusives, since they tend to be so obscure that reviews simply don’t exist and I have to find some weird blog that bothered to review it."
patientgamers,fbzlj4b,t3_ef7toa,1577250784.0,"As someone who only discovered the Zelda series this year, definitely check out A Link Between Worlds. It is a great game in its own right that doesn’t require any nostalgia to appreciate it, but it’s definitely worth playing A Link to the Past if you haven’t before (for me there was literally a couple day’s wait between playing the SNES game for the first time and the 3DS game, so there was no real nostalgia factor involved). It’s a direct sequel to that game but in the way that any Zelda game is, so really it just shares the same basic overworld but it’s still set a century later with a new plot and you don’t play the same character.

Animal Crossing New Leaf might be the best value on the system in terms of play time, if you’re into that kind of game. When I first got it I played it for at least an hour (usually a couple or more) per day for like two months straight before getting burned out from the grind and I still didn’t come close to “completing” the game.

Also be sure to check out New Super Mario Bros 2, in my opinion it’s a dramatic improvement over the first game (both in mechanics and visuals) and I think it might even be my favorite game in the whole New Super Mario Bros series.

There are a lot more great games worth checking out but I only got my first 2DS a little over a year ago and my first 3DS earlier this year so I’m still pretty new to the system."

Meanwhile they’ll happily attach a trailer to a Mercury Mountaineer, Mazda Navajo, or Lincoln Aviator, which are all mechanically identical to the Explorer and prone to the same handling characteristics that got the Explorer blacklisted."

StarWars,fbyg26d,t3_ef0thv,1577215995.0,"None, honestly.

- Fett is unnecessary, we already learned his backstory in the prequels and he ended up being kind of disappointing in the original trilogy. Besides, The Mandalorian is essentially a Fett story without all of the baggage.

- Yoda might be interesting if it took place hundreds of years before the prequels, but it would be too easy to get wrong and it’s not really necessary. Also what is with that poster, it’s horrifying.

- Maul seems kind of unnecessary, and a lot of his appeal comes from the mystery in my opinion.

- Vader is completely unnecessary, we have the prequels, the OT, and Rogue One.

- Revan could be interesting, but I still haven’t gotten around to playing KOTOR all the way through so I don’t know enough about him.

- Kenobi is the only one that sounds really promising, but we’re getting a TV show which is even better in my opinion.


What I want from Star Wars going forward is more stuff like The Mandalorian and Rogue One: new stories unrelated to existing characters that drop the space opera elements and experiment with other genres. How about a murder mystery whodunnit involving bounty hunters, droids, and Force users? How about a racing drama in the high-stakes world of podracing? How about a full-on comedy in the Star Wars universe? An interplanetary espionage thriller? A buddy cop movie with droids? A musician biopic? Just anything that tries something new, pushes the boundaries, and doesn’t just rehash the stories and characters that we already know."
GamePhysics,fby0fgt,t1_fbxwqdy,1577205094.0,"I asked if the *game* was based on Ridge Racer, like did they take the Ridge Racer engine and re-skin it with Initial D cars, because it seems to have the same weird drifting mechanics. But after looking it up it’s made by Sega and Ridge Racer was Namco so it’s probably just a coincidence."
GamePhysics,fbxveol,t3_eez43t,1577201527.0,Is this game based on Ridge Racer? I remember being able to do this in one of the Ridge Racer games because going into a drift would lock you onto rails and automatically steer you around corners no matter which direction the car was pointed. One of my favorite things to do was drift backwards (nose facing out) and do 360 drifts.
