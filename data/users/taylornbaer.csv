If you suspect someone of stealing/have evidence, they are supposed to call the police or just take the “loss” if you can’t prove it. Accusing customers of stealing is something you aren’t supposed to do in retail, it can be dangerous. OP did not need to submit to a bag check, any normal innocent person would and should refuse the search."

I clean my dishes and put them away and leave everyone else’s stuff for them to wash. They get done eventually. Maybe that’s passive aggressive sounding but I never rag on them for it, I just refuse to do their dishes. I honestly wouldn’t do anything like OP did, I’m not that type, I don’t ruin other people’s belongings or go in their room while they aren’t home. If I was pushed to my limits I’d probably do something like put them in a bag in front of his room like some people have mentioned."

It seems like OP was the only one on board with this anyway since his other roommates sold him out immediately. When you have to see someone everyday and live with them, shit like this creates more tension and I guarantee it won’t do anything but make Dan think his roommates are dicks. He’s not gonna have a spontaneous moment of self clarity. OP lashed out, and that’s hardly ever productive."

AmItheAsshole,fcs6rdk,t3_eil6f3,1577912221.0,YTA. Use your words. My BF and I had a roommate that was super anal and one time she brought all the dishes in the sink and slammed them down in front of our door instead of just asking us to clean them. I know you asked him to do it but you should just keep asking or give him an ultimatum or something. Don’t fuck with people’s rooms.
AmItheAsshole,fcoylwu,t1_fcos8j9,1577845192.0,Think of it like going to an interview. You’re 10 minutes late it’s a bad first impression. A first date is a first impression so why make it bad for no reason? OP knows what they’re looking for in a partner so I don’t think they missed out on anything.

AmItheAsshole,fcnwwyy,t1_fcnw24q,1577820072.0,"To your last point, yes for sure people have that stigma for reasons like lying and cheating.

AmItheAsshole,fcnk0wa,t1_fcnhb7m,1577813120.0,These people don’t go on dates. They’d rather sit on FB and obsess over every minute detail of a person until they don’t want to see them anymore because of some arbitrary page they liked 5 years ago.

AmItheAsshole,fcnimvh,t1_fcnf8qy,1577812445.0,Seems like it. It’s like “I’m suspicious you’re hiding something and that’s YOUR FAULT”. You could just google him and find out he really doesn’t have social media if you’re that paranoid about it.
