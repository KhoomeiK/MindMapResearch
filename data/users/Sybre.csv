Eve,ffgo67r,t1_ffghqae,1579910833.0,"> AT means something to a lot of players, whether they're passionate enough to say something about it or not. It brings new players to the game when they see it streaming on twitch, and it's a great experience for everyone involved.

The first AT I watched was absolutely fucking amazing. I personally like hockey and follow my teams, but I *never* truly understood the passion and experience that conventional team sports bring until I felt that watching the AT.

It really sucked me into learning how to PVP. I'm still bad at that though, to be fair."

AskReddit,ffbjvsb,t1_ffaaen0,1579768771.0,A lot of places don't have the internet speed for a direct download and ordering games online always risk not getting it on day one. Plus they changed their stock to a lot of memorabilia.

AskReddit,ffbjcz7,t1_ffa7ulq,1579768039.0,"I actually went into the last Radio Shack in my state 2 years ago. It was honestly really sad. 95% of it was filled with shitty toys that you would find in a pharmacy and off-brand Bluetooth speakers. The 5% were electrical components, so old that the bags were turning yellow and the tags had to be hand-written numerous times. I thought it was really sad until I got to the register and realized I spent $50 on $5 worth of components I could have gotten online."

ditto.

The odds of someone wanting to hack your Eve account, finding your cellphone number, calling up customer support impersonating someone, and knowing the master password to decrypt your 2FA is nearly nonexistant.

I'm not sure if you understand the concept of security and safeguards, but the second the theft requires too much effort, they're just going to move on. 

Taking advantage of Authy's safeguards will keep your account just as safe as any other 2FA service. At that point, it's entirely up to you to not give up vital information."
Eve,ff4xv9o,t3_eriw74,1579575068.0,"Just to add to this, Authy is a way better alternative than Google's 2FA. Authy allows you to access your auth codes on as many devices you set up and is connected via phone number rather than just the app itself. That means if your phone gets ruined, you'll still have all your 2FA codes the second you have that device up and running by just sending a text."
