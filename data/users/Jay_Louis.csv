His family will never live this stain down. They'd be better off moving to Moscow."
worldnews,fgp66s6,t1_fgoyezz,1580997857.0,"Bolton will eventually give that prime-time speech and it'll be damning. I wished he'd done it sooner, but maybe this will be better. Let those Republicans that voted to acquit suffer that scarlet letter forever."
worldnews,fgp63by,t1_fgowaap,1580997788.0,"Fox News + Talk Radio + Lack of Education = Republican Voters.  My only hope is the next generation, if enough kids are disgusted by the Trump Clown Show, especially in the red states, they can turn the tide in just a few years.  But it'll be up to the next generation to save us.  The old angry white folks are lost in a sea of media propaganda, and they aren't coming back."
worldnews,fgp5yvn,t1_fgp3hci,1580997700.0,"I mean this isn't new.  They fabricated the ridiculous Kenyan Birth Certificate and Benghazi ""scandals"" out of total fiction. They turned Hillary's email server into some egregious breach (even as Trump hangs at Mar-a-Lago and talks on an unsecured cell phone).  They shut down the government because of the ""deficit"" but now run trillion dollar deficits without blinking.  The only solution is to remove the Republican Party from every facet of power in every corner of this country.  We need to fumigate this toxic anti-American cult out of mainstream society and drive it to the margins, where all cults should reside."
worldnews,fgp5q3y,t1_fgp41f6,1580997526.0,"The thing about history is it's never kind to absurdist arguments.  I remember back in 2003 when numerous pundits and politicians seriously made the argument that Saddam ""of course"" had major weapons of mass destruction and if we didn't act now by immediately invading the country, we'd risk calamity.  17 years later, that argument is settled.  The same will hold true for this impeachment.  Trump is guilty as sin.  The evidence is overwhelming.  In ten years (if not sooner) those that didn't support impeachment will live with that disgrace in public."
worldnews,fgp5hzk,t1_fgp57hq,1580997362.0,"If the upcoming election is remotely fair (a big ""if"") there's no way Trump wins again. I don't care if it's Bernie, Biden, Warren, or My Aunt Tillie, no way Trump wins Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania again, assuming the votes are actually counted.  There's also no way he won in 2016, but at least we have the excuse of not being aware that Putin was hacking databases back then."

Showerthoughts,fezinxm,t1_fezfem9,1579457762.0,"That's ahistorical gibberish. ""Mein Kampf"" was published in 1928 by Hitler and was straight up Anti-Semitic demonizing. It presented a binary in which Germany (the Aryan) was being invaded and destroyed from within by the Jew. While it did not explicitly advocate murder, the philosophy was not like all others, and certainly not like socialism in the 1920s, which embraced multicultural sensibilities (see Horace Kallen's ""cultural pluralism""). Trump's America First nonsense does echo it."

worldnews,fds8vn0,t1_fdru017,1578697012.0,"It depends, though, if there's another great awakening.  The massive recession of 2008 and the failure of the Iraq invasion forced even the most delusional Bush defenders to grapple with what a colossal failure his presidency had been.  Trump's ruinous actions are mostly unfelt at this point, as most of us don't know immigrant families and the stock market continues record highs (even as the deficit spirals out of control).  One recession and republicans will be done for a decade. The GOP should hope Trump loses and Bernie wins because when the Trump recession finally does come, they'll be able to use their media empire to blame the ""socialist"" and muddy the waters.  Four more years of Trump and the disaster will be impossible to redirect."

For example, the entire right wing grift collective (Tomi, Milo, Shapiro, Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy) were just young people who discovered how much game and attention they could get if they served as trigger points on hot topic issues. If you're willing to be shameless in your pursuit of fame and fortune, become a bikini model or an unapologetic white supremacist. Both trigger the same engagement urge."
