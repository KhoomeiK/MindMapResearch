TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fdeu9yr,t1_fdes878,1578346736.0,"I work in a family owned hardware store. It’s been in business for nearly 40 years, so naturally one would expect many of the locals to know the owner. It’s only the ones who act like cuntmuffins that try to use this to their advantage. It’s really hard not to laugh when they say they’re good friends with “Mark”, known him for years, think he should know his staff is uncooperative, blah, blah, blah...the owners’ name is Mack. It’s on the side of the building! Smh."
