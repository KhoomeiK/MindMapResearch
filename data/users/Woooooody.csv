fatlogic,ffcj8qv,t1_ffcf5e7,1579800633.0,I was the same! Then I did nothing but running! Which is an easy path to injuries. Now I do strength work and some cross training that I don't enjoy nearly as much so I can keep doing the bit I love!
fatlogic,ff9pneo,t1_ff94053,1579718141.0,"Yep, I had a root canal yesterday on a tooth with an abscess so I was feeling pretty sorry for myself and I had a giant chocolate chip muffin! (Once the anaesthetic wore off and I could taste again!). I don't feel bad about it, most days don't include root canals and I have better coping mechanisms for more frequent bad days."
fatlogic,ff9p0bh,t1_ff93biq,1579717669.0,"That's how I use it, usually lunch time when I just can't be bothered with actual food but I'm hungry. It's also been really helpful while I've had TMJ problems!"
fatlogic,ff9of2z,t1_ff9deoe,1579717253.0,I actually just said that out loud to my phone! I'm glad I'm alone.
fatlogic,ff7588x,t1_ff727us,1579641368.0,"I was 22 when I lost my Dad, it was 12 years ago last Thursday. Every happy occasion is tinged with sadness that my dad isn't here to be part of it."
fatlogic,ff6f1zx,t3_erw5oj,1579625792.0,"She has two children, she should damn well care whether or not she dies young! Losing a parent before their time can really fuck you up :("
fatlogic,ff5w3e3,t3_erssa0,1579612216.0,"I'm starting to find the word ""curious"" annoying now!"
running,ff5vdhs,t1_ff5q517,1579611548.0,"The lululemon one is the only one I've found I can run with, those tiny holes don't do much but it's just enough that I don't feel like I'm suffocating!"
fatlogic,ff454wa,t1_ff445n3,1579555754.0,I don't even burn that many on a 6 mile run anymore unless it's a hilly course. On the flat I burn about 80 calories a mile!
fatlogic,fekk5pu,t3_epnalm,1579201743.0,My mum got fat then got T2 diabetes. Does diabetes exist outside of time?
fatlogic,feb7qba,t1_fe8lbsj,1578956168.0,How do you even manage to get fat with the food going through that quickly?? He must eat *a lot*!
fatlogic,fdofdjr,t1_fdna4rq,1578604047.0,"I've still not found an actual American cheese I like. The best cheddar I've found it New Zealand sharp cheddar from Trader Joe's, although that's not actually American!"
fatlogic,fdn9eyu,t1_fdn175h,1578580782.0,"I moved from Britain to the US nearly 3 years ago and I'm still not used to the bread, I have up eating it in the end. In fact food in general has probably been the hardest thing to adjust to, so many things are either really sweet or really salty and sometimes, somehow, both!"
fatlogic,fcyf6pq,t3_ejjy31,1578079172.0,If you're going to go down that road you could ask that about anything! Did my body consent to having a shower? Maybe it wasn't in the mood to get all wet.
fatlogic,fcv09hc,t1_fct5fk9,1577992023.0,"I don't like eating big meals, they just make me feel sleepy and lethargic. If I ate just my meals I'd only be getting about 1000 calories a day. Eating little and often just works for me."
fatlogic,fcovo7w,t1_fcck6pq,1577842837.0,"We didn't learn about it in health class, we didn't even have anything called health class. Is that an American thing?"
fatlogic,fcmw5jk,t1_fcl4pgx,1577795019.0,"I can't do a pull up either, I'm 120lbs with the upper body strength of a weak 3 year old. I'm working on it though, started being able to just hang pathetically from the bar, now I can hang from the bar and almost imperceptibly bend my elbows!"
fatlogic,fc64xim,t1_fc62wva,1577472361.0,"Me too, I'm finding it hard to eat well anyway as I have terrible TMJ pain and am on a mostly liquid diet, but you know what really easy to eat without much chewing? Chocolate! Just leave it to melt away! I'm feeling pretty run down though :("
fatlogic,fc301af,t3_efvcat,1577378363.0,"My mum is slowly getting bigger. I don't see her often as we live in different countries but she's visiting for Christmas. It's so sad to see her getting tired walking up a slight incline or struggling to try clothes on cos her body is getting in the way. Even if weight wasn't affecting her health it's certainly affecting her quality of life, and she's only just into the obese category, probably wouldn't even register as a small fat to some of these people!"
fatlogic,fbxjcmy,t1_fbw4vnc,1577190282.0,"I'm 34 and got told I look like a teenager by the flight attendant serving the alcohol the other day, I also got ID'd buying Christmas crackers! If weight loss ages you I must have looked about 10 40lbs ago!"
