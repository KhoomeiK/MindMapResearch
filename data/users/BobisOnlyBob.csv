DarkSouls2,ffa0exk,t1_ff9obsb,1579725359.0,"For me, DS1 is consistently clunk in terms of movement. The best it gets is being a high-stamina Darkwood Grain Ring ninja.

DS2 varies with how much you invest in Adaptability - a questionable design decision but one I accept. Being able to roll diagonally is a blessing over DS1. 

DS3 is swift and agile, almost Bloodborne-esque at times.

Bloodborne is jittery and swift and even manic - bloodthirsty. 

Sekiro is as fast as Bloodborne, but I feel it's a lot more measured and precise with its counter and parry play."
