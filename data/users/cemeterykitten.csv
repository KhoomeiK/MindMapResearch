cancer,ffvz2mi,t3_evg64c,1580277847.0,"I'm sorry.  I would say be with him as much as you can.  I really don't know what to say.  I got these suggestions from the Huff Post. Maybe:

1.Don't expect to be ready for the natural order of things; you won't be.

**2.** Never let anyone belittle this loss, make you feel guilty for grieving deeply, or hurry you through your grief. You are entitled to feel all of grief's intricacies and all of grief's intensity.

**3.** Grieving for a parent, like all grief, can be exhausting emotionally, physically and spiritually. Be kind to yourself.

**4.** This work of grief takes time; the process must not be hurried. And it is never entirely over.

**5.** Even as an adult, don't be surprised by feelings of abandonment and uncertainty that you experience.

**6.** After they are gone your parents will continue to be a part of your life, just in a different sense. You will always be their son or daughter.

7.Grief does not end. Rather grief comes and goes. And then it comes again.

**8.** If you feel the need, seek out support from others who've been there, a friend who cares, or a professional who can help guide you through the work of grief.

I hope this helps. You're not alone."

AskWomen,ffse0vz,t3_eup3zo,1580179438.0,"My anxiety is with crowds and talking to people. In grocery stores,if I feel overwhelmed, I usually look at the floor. I usually avoid crowds as much as possible,if I can't (let's say a crowded bus),I usually tell my anxiety to STFU or I'll sing a song in my head telling it to go fu\*k off. I've also been telling myself to immerse myself into that uncomfortableness. Yeah,being surrounded by people sucks,but grow the fu\*k up (me talking to myself).

For talking to people (I also hate answering my phone),I have a job where I have to ask questions or I'm screwed,so I'm forced to face my anxiety everyday. Good exposure therapy.

Also,looking at this from a logical point of view can help. Maybe ask yourself, ""why do I feel anxious? Does it really make any sense to get worked up about this?"""
