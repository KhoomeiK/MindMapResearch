AnimalsBeingJerks,ff22kb2,t3_er4294,1579492076.0,I had to watch three times to make sure I was seeing that right. How far did that pup fly??
cats,fep3efg,t3_eq8lzh,1579311243.0,"Elevator butt! Idk, but since they’re moving into it rather than away from it, I assume it’s an enjoyment thing. My cat does this. If you stop and start, she’ll go up and down."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fdpggco,t1_fdcq980,1578627981.0,"I had a car place pull that on me. Told me that legally they couldn’t let me leave without four new tires, and oh look the only ones we have are $300 each. I was broke and in school and the tires were fine when I drove in. I wasn’t “legally” allowed to inspect the tire they said was bad. I basically sat in their waiting room and refused to leave until they let me have my car back. Drove it to a different place that said my tires were fine."
cats,fdpc7wj,t3_em9s6d,1578624982.0,"When I played this my cat got really upset. First the ears went back, and then she started shifting around, then she meowed, and finally came to comfort/confront* the phone. It’s been off for a minute now but she’s still upset with me. 

* I’m never totally sure which, if I’m honest. Both involve slapping."

cats,fc7ft50,t3_eggeb2,1577506133.0,"I’m so sorry. It’s nice you had such a long time together to make each other feel loved and happy. It’s still always too soon. 

I know it’s hard to let go, even when they’re sick and in pain. Sending my love."
StartledCats,fbxm4uf,t3_edxicg,1577193537.0,They shouldn’t be fed on their back like that. They could aspirate the milk and choke.
