I will grant that it's certainly emotionally easier, in the moment, to have someone else surgically kill the baby which you can't see than to be, say, an ancient Roman drowning your disabled newborn. But I'm not sure why this matters for the law, especially since a law banning abortions would be accompanied by an education campaign about why this is wrong.

The references to a zygote are also not especially relevant. A woman has to know she's pregnant before she has an abortion--so she has to at least miss her period.

What I was getting at with the polytheism/monotheism thing is this: the difference between the two isn't that monotheism just asserts that there is only one of the same kind of being polytheists believe in. God in the Christian (and the Jewish, Muslim, Aristotelian, etc.) sense refers to an entirely different *kind* of being than polytheists do.

There are better arguments that show it's TRUE that God exists, not just that believing it is in your self-interest; ultimately, we should believe things because they're true. 

You're probably right that the logic of Pascal's Wager, if applied outside of the God question, will lead to self-contradiction. I don't claim to know how but it sounds plausible. 

*That said,* it would be hard to see it supporting polytheism, but this is because of the kind of being we mean by ""God,"" rather than anything unique to Pascal. God is defined as Being Itself, Unlimited Power, The Greatest Being That Can Be Conceived, take your pick. There could not be more than one being of this sort *even in principle.* 

For there to be more than one thing of the same kind, there will have to be a difference between them. This means that there will need to be some feature that one has that the other lacks. Now, under any definition of God (in the classical sense, which Pascal means), He is all-powerful and perfect. A being which *lacked* anything wouldn't BE all-powerful and perfect--it would be just short of it--and then it wouldn't be what we mean by God. So in short, when you really understand what we mean by God, you see that in principle there could not be more than one.

And indeed in the polytheistic religions we see that they aren't describing even the same *kind* of being that we Catholics mean by God. They aren't *all* powerful, just very powerful. They cause a lot of things, but not everything. They know much, but not all that can be known. They are beings, but not Being Itself. They're not even non-contingent: they happen to exist but could have failed to exist. And so on. 

Again, I ultimately think you're right that a Gambler's Philosophy in general doesn't work; but then, there are actual PROOFS of God's existence.

Right, but the classical idea of God is not merely a being which *happens* to be all-powerful, but one that *is Existence Itself.* God cannot be something that merely happens not to be caused by something else but a different kind of being all together: one that could not have failed to exist even in principle. That's what's meant by ""non-contingent."" That people might mistake aliens for such a being does not really get at the point. 

>I think limiting your thought process to thinking our universe is the only one really hinders things.

The idea of God doesn't is separate from the idea of how many universes there might be. The problem is simply that there can't, in principle, only be things which owe their existences to other things. There has to be something which doesn't need to be caused. 

>Also, ""good"" is totally subjective, if there really was a being that made our entire universe, the extremely trivial things that we define as good or bad wouldn't mean anything to them.

Individual people can have the wrong idea of what good and bad are, and be subjectively wrong in that sense. But it does not follow that Goodness doesn't *exist.* Indeed, the idea that there is no such thing as objective good and bad is not even coherent. It would mean that the statement ""Good and bad are subjective."" could not even be true because truth is a kind of goodness."
TrueOffMyChest,ff4qdhu,t1_ff4bq8d,1579569919.0,"I didn't say that it was impossible to understand, just that it was long. I didn't want to waste your or my time. But you sound at least vaguely interested so I'll take the time. I would not assume that you know it due to a Philosophy class or two--it's a notoriously misunderstood argument (even by theists). 

**Why A Non-Contingent Being Must Exist**

To start with, the Prime Cause does *not* have anything to do with being first ""in time."" Aristotle, for example, actually believed that the physical universe had always existed and had no beginning. The Cause is ""first"" in a different sense of the word. (Obviously not all theists believed the world had always existed, but the point is that this question is actually SEPARATE from the question of God's existence). The problem is what maintains the existence of any thing here and NOW, what SUSTAINS its existence continually rather than what caused it to BEGIN to exist. 

To illustrate, let's say I have a cup of coffee sitting on a desk four feet off the ground. If we ask ""What causes the cup of coffee to sit where it is?"" We can say the desk does. But a desk can't hold itself up either--the floor is what keeps it in place. And the floor itself is held up by the building's foundations, which themselves are held up by the ground.

Now, a chain of ""causes"" of this kind (called a ""hierarchical series"") cannot go on infinitely: not because ""there must be a starter"" but because none of the things in the series have any inherent power of their own to hold things up--they hold things up because something is holding them up. The series must end in something that doesn't need to be held up--that can hold itself up without being held up. It cannot be, as the old story of the world on the back of a turtle goes, ""turtles all the way down.""

It would also have to be something fundamentally different from the others in the series. For if we just said that the series ends in something that just ""happens"" to be floating there, we won't really have explained anything. If I say the cup of coffee is held up by the desk and the desk just floats there and isn't held up by anything, and there's nothing in the nature of a desk that makes it do this, I haven't explained how the coffee cup is being held up at all. 

Now what is true in this example is also true of existence in general. That is, all sorts of things that do exist have no inherent power of existing in their nature -- that is, they could have failed to exist. We call these ""contingent"" beings. These things can have their existence caused by other contingent things, but there can't only be contingent things. There will have to be something that doesn't need to have its existence caused by something else, a kind of being that *could not have failed to exist EVEN IN PRINCIPLE.*

Now, many (bad) theists stop here and say ""And there you go, God."" and when the atheist responds ""Well, why doesn't God need to have his existence caused too?"" they reply ""Well he just doesn't. He just kind of exists without any explanation."" You will rightly note that this is a bad argument. You could after all, say, ""Well in that case why not just say that the laws of physics, or the first atom, or some such thing, just happened to exist without any explanation?""

*But this ISN'T what the Prime Cause argument is.* For if we end our chain of causes with something that happens to exist but could, in principle, have failed to exist, we will not really have explained anything. Even a very powerful spirit that just happens to exist but could, in principle, have not existed, doesn't solve the problem.

**The Non-Contingent Being Can Only Be Existence Itself:**

So instead, we have to go further. What sort of being would it be that could not fail to exist, even in principle? This is a hard one to answer--it will have to be something where saying ""Such and such does exist but could have failed to exist"" is something that doesn't even *make sense* in principle. Anything other than that, no matter how powerful, will still be ""contingent.""

Now, Existence Itself will serve as a non-contingent being. For it doesn't make sense to say Existence itself could have failed to exist: the very nature of the thing IS existence. It would be like saying squareness could have failed to be square. So, the being holding all contingent beings up just IS Existence itself. Existence itself is non-contingent--it cannot even in principle be ""caused"" by something more fundamental. 

**The Non-Contingent Being Would Necessarily Be Power and Goodness Itself, Actus Purus**

Now, we haven't yet got as far as any sort of God. But let's reason as to what this thing is. First, the being that is Existence Itself would also have to be ""Pure Act,"" as Aristotle calls it. This requires understanding the idea of actuality and potentiality--to keep it short, something that something COULD be but currently ISN'T is called ""potential"" and something which actually IS we call ""actual."" 

Now Existence itself cannot in principle have any potentials that could be ""actualized"" (brought into existence). It's Existence itself: this would be a contradiction in terms. This also means that this being would have to be all-powerful. Power, after all, is just the ability to cause things to happen--to make what is potential, actual. In other words, to bring things into Being. Now Being Itself cannot ""lack"" the ability to cause something to Be even in principle. So this Being would not just be all-powerful but literally Power itself; Power basically IS Being, understood differently. 

Similarly, there could only be one such Being even in principle. For there to be more than one of the same kind of thing, there will have to be something that distinguishes them: some feature that one has that the other lacks. But this is not possible for something that is purely Actual--if it lacked something, it would have some unactualized potential. There cannot be more than one being that is Existence Itself--the concept is incoherent. 

And lastly, the non-contingent being would have to be all-good, indeed, it would be Goodness Itself. This is because, to these philosophers, Goodness IS Being. When we say something is good, we mean that it actually has the features it ought to have--when it is bad, or not as good, it lacks some feature that it should have--that is, is has an unactualized potential. So it cannot make sense to say that Being Itself could ""lack"" some feature that ought to have, and it is therefore not perfectly good--it is Existence Itself and by definition cannot have some potential that needs to be brought into existence in it. 

So, what we have is a Non-Contingent Being that could not have failed to exist, even in principle, and is by definition Power Itself and Goodness Itself. This is what classical theism *means* by ""God.""

**The Problem of Evil**

So, the problem of evil. How could a Being that is Goodness itself coexist with suffering? Evil is essentially an absence of some good, a definition especially clear in suffering. Suffering is, after all, caused by us lacking something (food, health, love, peace, joy) that we need. Wouldn't a God that pumped more goodness into creation so as to eliminate the absences caused by suffering be a ""better"" God than one who wouldn't?

The rational answer, though not satisfying, is pretty simple: God would not allow any evil of any kind UNLESS by allowing certain evils He could bring about some good that would not be possible (even in principle) without it. *How* this works is not something we should expect to fully understand. Freedom being only truly possible if we are free to harm each other, as you note, does explain most of the suffering in the world but not *all* of it. Cancer, and even just death in general does not seem to be a result of anyone's particular sins. 

On that kind of evil, the pure philosopher will have a hard time explaining just what good is brought about by this sort of suffering. We might be able to dimly understand how some particular ill could cause some good--i.e. we can occasionally see in our own lives how some natural suffering made us better--but we can hardly account for all of it that way. 

The philosopher may be tempted to say ""Well then perhaps this non-contingent being that is Existence Itself isn't real after all."" But the problem is that, in the absence of such a being, the universe has no explanation. It will ultimately end in a ""brute fact"": some thing that could have failed to exist but just does exist for no reason at all. This, however, for reasons I won't get into here, when followed all the way through, destroys the very concept of rational thinking and leaves us with no reason to trust the rational process that got us there. 

I do think, however, that the story doesn't end there. This Non-Contingent Being doesn't just leave us to figure out Its existence rationally: it gave us revelation, as well. The Catholic answer to ""Why Cancer?,"" and my own, is simply this: Death and disease actually *are* the effects of someone's free choice--namely, our first parents--and the good which this suffering brought about by allowing this are God becoming Man, dying, and rising, so that we might attain a previously impossible glory by using our own sufferings (our crosses) to make us like Him.

TrueOffMyChest,ff4ccnp,t1_ff3kexe,1579560277.0,"I agree with you that people ought not to have sexual intercourse if they really couldn't take care of the child that might result. (I am thinking not really of financially poor families here but non-families, i.e. sleeping around with people who would make absolutely terrible fathers and mothers and leave you with the child). Part of the problem is that abortion enables lots of enormously irresponsible sexual behaviour--i.e. you can always kill any inconvenient children that you conceive. 

>More funding into sex education so we're not stuck teaching kids to just abstain, readily available birth control for men and women, letting people get sterilized when they want to.

Sex education which essentially encourages out of wedlock sex is part of what got us *into* this mess. Look at the sheer number of abortions annually. All contraception does is *reduce* the chance a child will be conceived, not eliminate it. (When the irresponsible party is not a woman, we get this: This is why we don't let men off the hook for child support on the grounds that they used birth control). Without abortion as a safety net, even with the use of contraception, unrestricted fornication means lots of babies without proper families."

I don't judge people who have difficulty accepting the idea of God due to suffering they've experienced: I don't *agree* with them but I certainly *understand* them. 

As for the rational argument. Do you want the whole, full form argument I alluded to--i.e. why even ""non-religious"" people like Aristotle argued that there simply must be an all-good, all-powerful being that simply is Being itself? I am happy to write it, but it's a lot of reading. The problem of evil can't be fully understood until you understand precisely the sort of Being God is.
