femalehairadvice,ffh6lgx,t3_etcqu7,1579924543.0,"It’s pretty much Pureology Hydrate shampoo, I actually do recommend it BUT be aware it is a very heavy and thick shampoo. To get it working well you will have to lather, and lather, and lather, and later some more. Then suddenly it will suds lol. Then you have to rinse, and rinse, and rinse some more until it is all out of your hair. If you don’t mind doing the work in the shower then give it a try."

I have seen was he knocked up a girl in his college dorm, started drinking, academic suspension for poor grades due to always being drunk, beats girl he knocked up, trespassed from campus, restraining order from girl, decided to get drunk and drive across state back home, high speed chase with police helicopter, arrested for dui  plus fleeing and evading, ends up with a decently long jail sentence, kid turned out not to be his. I never heard what happened after that but I presume it didn’t make a sudden turn upwards for him, he was actually decently smart, or so we thought."

I did think the 9/11 area was actually really well done and gave a good feel for just how much confusion there was, and how much we relied on traditional media outlets at that time. Unlike now with smartphones and twitter."

worldnews,fduwkhh,t1_fdtcpol,1578740060.0,"Same here, I’m stunned they admitted to it, especially this early into the investigation. Almost makes me wonder why they are admitting to it instead of pulling a Russia and denying no matter what, or destroying all evidence and witnesses and saying to prove they did it. Sadly all those people perished. Nonetheless I am interested to see how they play this out because I’m not seeing an endgame strategy. They dumped the nuclear agreement so they probably don’t want to leverage it into negotiations, and I don’t really know how they could use it as negative leverage against the US since the major parties involved are Ukraine which relies on the US pretty heavily and Canada. Neither of which I can believe would hold the US liable for the shoot down based on trying to maybe say the US was the originator the the violence."
