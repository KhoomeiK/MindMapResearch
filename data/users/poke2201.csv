SiegeAcademy,feihggs,t3_epahw7,1579138624.0,"Lets start with the major glaring issue:

>I also can't use voice.

**WHY?**  Its a game where information changes quickly and people hear faster than they can type.  You're literally handicapping yourself *and your team*  by doing that.

>How much practice will I need to do in t-hunt to have above average aim?

I used to think like that, but rephrasing the question would be more helpful here: ""How would a plat/diamond/champion frag better?""  

I changed it to that because as you go higher up, your aim is more or less going to be based on positioning, intel, and reaction time imo.  Lower ranks play a very different game to high ranks and so its hard to generalize how you can ""aim"" better.  

For now, you want to be looking at your fundamentals.  You want to have your crosshairs at head level at all times, try goign through T hunts with ADS on at all times and then add some leans when you turn corners. 

>And how do I get sufficient map knowledge? And is there a better way to develop game sense then just playing?

Its a start, but when I say Sandwich or Africa on Border, do you know what I'm talking about?  Theres a bunch of smaller microcalls in R6 on every map people use and knowing those is important as well. I believe there's some youtube videos out there that outline the major important calls on every ESL Pro League (if not Ranked) map in the game.

The second part of your question is play more.  You've played 65 hours which means about 40 ish hours give or take if you're taking your Steam numbers.  Game sense is learned by experience and watching others play the game."
