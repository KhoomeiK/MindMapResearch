Everyone *does* fall into different social categories. That's what makes diversity. It's very similar to how I may be targeted by a certain ethnic group because people of my group are less likely to fight back, particularly when outnumbered. 

The mentality that causes people to not go around acting everyone owes them something is associated with the mentality that causes theft rates from a given group to be lower.
