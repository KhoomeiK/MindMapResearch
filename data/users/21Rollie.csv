Cows are fat af and that’s on purpose, so are chickens. As for cow titty juice, about 25% of the world has evolved specifically to be able to process it in adulthood. Dairy cows exist for that reason only, it’s been genetically bred into them. And don’t play eating dogs as a cultural tradition for the Chinese. A small sect of them do it but thats like saying every American eats roadkill because there are a few that do it. I’ll eat my words if some fast food chain comes out with fried dog or baked giraffe placenta or some other crazy shit but the country as a whole eats from the same basic groups of protein."

They’re objectively more dangerous for consumption. I’d rather get all my protein from farmed cockroaches than from wild animals, particularly mammals. 

And not scientifically speaking, those people’s eating habits are fucking weird. Not every Chinese person eats like that so you can’t hide behind “culture.” It’s a few thousand maybe out of a billion people."

NoStupidQuestions,fewhfhg,t1_fesbzld,1579410630.0,What’s funny is this mentality of segregation is part of the reason our problems exist. Rich people fuck off to the suburbs or to private schools and this sucks a great source of income for poorer schools. A great remedy to that would be even distribution of funds regardless of where the taxes come from or if you send a kid to private school but those same rich fucks lobby against it.
NoStupidQuestions,fewgv00,t1_feryan0,1579410367.0,"Nope. Definitely not the case. You think every rich prick in the suburbs of a major city is just gifted? That’s far from the case. It’s that their school systems can afford to buy the best teachers, have the latest technology, they never struggle with hunger or malnutrition, they have supplementary classes, and they themselves have educated parents. If you have all that and you DONT turn out successful then there has to be something wrong with you. In terms of ability to learn, some of us are more advanced but we just learn faster, not necessarily better. Ultimately just about anybody can learn anything given the resources. That’s why Cuba has so many doctors, not because it’s an island of geniuses, but because healthcare is one of the government’s top priorities"
