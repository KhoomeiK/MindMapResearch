relationship_advice,ffko9lw,t3_eu07j0,1580026044.0,"This subreddit is usually frustrating to me how quickly everyone says DUMP HIM over everything but listen, DUMP HIM.  Man, he is completely using Tinder.  He may not be actively meeting women but is certainly speaking to people and swiping.  Also lied about it. And this description of on again off again because he does stupid stuff and needs space? Seriously, what a disaster.  Bail."
relationship_advice,ffkmymu,t1_ffkjtex,1580025414.0,Goodness what an unnecessarily cunty response haha
dating_advice,ffkfr64,t1_ffkew9r,1580022033.0,I'd have to agree that a simple and probably silly conversation you managed to take in a strange direction and seemed to handle it quite immaturely.  You sound judgey throughout.
dating_advice,ffkeanb,t3_etyuqw,1580021349.0,"People need to realize that every conversation that starts, then doesnt go somewhere, isn't ghosting.  And just because someone is smart, handsome, funny or whatever that it has to go somewhere or someone has to be interested.  It's usually just a gut feeling."
dating_advice,ffkdwj3,t1_ffjind2,1580021165.0,This is silly
todayilearned,ff2w1xm,t1_ff2seqp,1579526329.0,Oh agreed!  I'd say punk too haha but people were being picky so I figured if correct them then if they wanted to pick it apart
