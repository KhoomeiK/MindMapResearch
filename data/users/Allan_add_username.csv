PacificNorthwest,fff4go5,t1_ffec9jz,1579875453.0,I constantly get passed by cyclists while sitting in stop and go.  Seattle commutes are gnarly.
Retconned,ffecozb,t1_fewixhb,1579843260.0,"I would think if your brain is processing things faster, you would hear the music as being slower.  If anything, age leads to an increase in knowledge, but a decrease in gray matter, so maybe the music sounds faster because of the natural degradation of our bodies?  I noticed it myself with “Don’t stop me now” by queen.  Remember it being just a little slower.  Part of that may be that I always have it stuck in my head, but go for long stretches without hearing it, so maybe my brain forgets the proper tempo."

wiiu,ffd7a5c,t1_ffc2w1e,1579814803.0,The Wii U is surprisingly powerful.  I used to play split screen wit my friend and it would rarely lag.

applehelp,ff7wzzy,t3_es2cuo,1579660356.0,"You can use the USB adapter and plug them together. The Pro with USB c uses the one for the MacBook, and the lightning iPads use the camera adapter, which I think you have to plug into power for this task."
