ireland,ffc92jv,t1_ffbrtgu,1579794329.0,"I disagree, they were quite apologetic in the past. Look up Tomiichi Maruyama's 1995 statements on Japan's imperialism is as follows:


> Japan's actions in a certain period of the past not only claimed numerous victims here in Japan but also left the peoples of neighboring Asia and elsewhere with scars that are painful even today. I am thus taking this opportunity to state my belief, based on my profound remorse for these acts of aggression, colonial rule, and the like caused such unbearable suffering and sorrow for so many people, that Japan's future path should be one of making every effort to build world peace in line with my no-war commitment. It is imperative for us Japanese to look squarely to our history with the peoples of neighboring Asia and elsewhere. Only with solid basis of mutual understanding and confidence that can be built through overcoming the pain on both sides, can we and the peoples of neighboring countries together clear up the future of Asia-Pacific.... On the issue of wartime 'comfort women,' which seriously stained the honor and dignity of many women, I would like to take this opportunity once again to express my profound and sincere remorse and apologies. With regard to this issue as well, I believe that one way of demonstrating such feelings of apologies and remorse is to work to further promote mutual understanding with the countries and areas concerned as well as to face squarely to the past and ensure that it is rightly conveyed to future generations. This initiative, in this sense, has been drawn up consistent with such belief


Then a bit further back 1993 Kono, then chief cabinet secretary, had this to say:


> Undeniably, this was an act, with the involvement of the military authorities of the day, that severely injured the honor and dignity of many women. The Government of Japan would like to take this opportunity once again to extend its sincere apologies and remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women


This followed the discovery of an historic document in the Defense Agency library that Japanese forces established and ran ""comfort stations"", following this discovery Kono promised more research into it and added it to the school books. 


The issue is quite recent with Shinzo Abe and his cabinet undoing the work of previous Prime Ministers and governments. He has watered down the apologies for imperial Japan's brutal rule undoing the work of the likes of Maruyama, he is trying to revise the history by saying there is no evidence of comfort women being forced(claiming they instead worked willingly as prostitutes for a hostile invading force that treated them like shit) undoing the promises made by Kono to ensure the issue is in the education system and properly researched and has tried to have books written on the subject altered to suit his narrative rather than what historical documents point to, . There was an article written by Asahi Shimbun(Japanese newspaper) that interviewed a man claiming to have witnessed comfort women first hand that turned out to be made up. Abe has abused this to call into question if they were ever forced, ignoring all the other genuine evidence from Japanese archives to push his narrative. 


The Japanese being unapologetic for war-time crimes and reneging on past promises is a relatively new phenomenon and Abe and his cabinet are squarely responsible for wanting to court Japanese far right nationalists with this shite. The previous prime ministers have openly objected to Abe's revisionism and watered down apologies."

I always considered rebel songs are about Irish republicanism and Nationalism, not any and all Irish folk music.

Future deals between the EU and other parties are where post Brexit UK will miss out the most, and obviously the EU itself, as a lot of existing trade partners have agreed to continue with their existing situation.

LivestreamFail,ff8psqt,t1_ff85bvz,1579690858.0,"Korean language has more phonemes than Japanese does, having both more consonant and vowel sounds than Japanese, but still less than English.  



But Korean and Japanese grammar is almost identical. Like the rules for forming sentences and stuff are quite similar, they both use particles, both can omit the subject from a sentence and both use topic markers. I've even heard it's possible to just replace Japanese/Korean words in a sentence with words from the other language and it'll be almost completely grammatically correct, but Korean has an explicit future tense, whereas Japanese just implies the future via context. 



So I think grammar wise Japanese and Korean speakers will have similar issues when learning English, like it's common for context to come at the start of Japanese/Korean sentences and the verb at the end, whereas in English the verb tends to come before the full context. Like in Japanese/Korean you might form a sentence like ""(I) to shop was going""(I would likely not be included in Japanese/Korean sentences as the subject is usually dropped), where as English tends to have the verb at the start with a pronoun""I was going to the shop"". So I have found Japanese/Korean speakers tend to make similar grammatical errors in English."

Apart from this UK has a deal with Aus/NZ that replicates the current conditions of EU trade.



As for America the current arrangement, again, replicates the US-EU arrangement. As for speculating about future deals, the TTIP talks collapsed due to the American side enacting a trade conflict. It's not clear if this will continue to cause issues between UK/US post Brexit, but regardless TTIP was a deeply unpopular trade deal, especially in the UK. In fact it was so unpopular it was used as one reason as to why the UK should withdraw from the EU under fears such deals would undermine British sovereignty. Nigel Farage in particular leading Brexiteer led a revolt against the TTIP in the European parliament, so Britain operating outside the EU will at best get the same unpopular TTIP that was rejected by not only the people who supported Brexit but people from the other side of the aisle as Labour were also positioned against it(though this may change when there is a change in leadership), which will necessarily be highly controversial and difficult to implement.

No, EU customs legislation still apply to goods entering Northern Ireland, including the EU commercial tariff, with the exception of goods that do not fulfill the risk criteria, which is yet to be fully determined. There is simply no way for goods to move into Northern Ireland without having some customs check performed on it to determine if it meets that risk criteria if the UK is intending on honouring this agreement.

I mean no offense, but you are ignoring something that is hugely important part of living anywhere. If you can't make a comfortable living here due to racism then that is going to have a hugely negative impact on all other aspects of your life, including making you feel like an outsider. 


Yeah getting here is not as difficult as some might make it out to be, but getting a job you can properly settle into without having to deal with the racism of not being Japanese(which can affect promotions, which jobs you can actually get, even in the case of one friend they worked with someone who refused to learn how to pronounce their Vietnamese name so just came up with a Japanese one instead and management didn't give a single fuck).

Now, I seem to remember someone linked an article written from the point of view of a person aligned with the Labour party, complaining that the Tory party has been woefully inactive on this issue.

Yes she mentions that 10 years ago someone was sent to a sensitivity training. But then goes on to say it is still a problem, and last i checked the Tories were responsible for the government for the past 9 years. So you want to try and give a second swing at the argument?
