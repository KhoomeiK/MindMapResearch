I could totally see this happening, and I don't doubt you for a second. As you have said, he knew he had health problems. I'm sure he planned ahead and talked to his wife about this stuff. 

To be honest, I'd probably do this for myself also - requesting my family to log on and give away all my gold to my guildies or whatever. 

Screw the people talking crap... I'm sure this was emotional for the wife but it can be a very healing moment also. Especially seeing how much he was cared for. It sounds like it was a touching tribute to this man."
