*** blushes***"
Watercolor,ffs8azb,t1_ffrsx2w,1580175603.0,"Thanks! It’s nicer in person(, but I didn’t do the surface of the water the way I wanted. )
The client who bought it loved it, so I guess that’s what matters most."
weddingplanning,ffs8595,t1_ffrqqms,1580175492.0,"Jeeez. Well, technically , it is a bag you can fit garments into, so I suppose they weren’t literally all that far off..."

weddingplanning,ffrjf2c,t3_eustcl,1580159238.0,"Wow, that’s really shitty of them. A $3,000 dress in a shopping bag. Are they completely out of boxes and going under or something?"

menwritingwomen,ffnl1ya,t1_ffn4v2g,1580067424.0,"Yup: threaten her with breaking her hands ( I think they also used knotted ropes to further damage her hands) and see if she snaps.

HomeDecorating,ffjypwi,t3_etyzio,1580010628.0,"Depends what you like, really. 
If , say, you’re into gardening, you could hang baskets from the ceiling, maybe put some artificial greenery in the baskets.  Or display tiles along the walls above the cabinets? 
What kind of things do you like?"
HomeDecorating,ffjy5es,t3_eu09lt,1580010176.0,"It needs some plants in there to help show the light and create some contrast to the shapes of the wood; a few more relaxing places to sit with some  comfy cushions that repeat colors and or textures/patterns from the rest of the house, and a contrasting table or two for drinks and books. I’d ditch the blinds and get something else lighter to create some light in there. The floor is a huge space that might need a solid color rug on it to help give the room a flow and focal area. 
It’s beautiful wood.  I’d try that before I painted over the gorgeous wood."
