Is usually stuff like “I can’t tell who you are in the group photo”, or like, “The bit about your favorite TV shows was great!” You can take it or leave it, but the perspectives of others can be interesting and informative. Sometimes people give bad advice too. Whatev! Like i said, you can take feedback and do what you want with it. Somebody telling you their opinion of a peripheral thing is not a mandate for you to change anything.

That’s completely ok, but the reason we have conversations is to come to an understanding about ideas and to work out that nuance. 

I’ve seen your replies throughout this post and well, you seem to be willingly ignorant about people’s explanations for things. To paraphrase:

Them: Here’s a viewpoint
You: So being loud and obnoxious is the answer?
Them: No, here’s an explanation of the subtleties of what I’m saying.
You: Ok, so you want to be loud and obnoxious.
Them: ...

You’ve consistently shown that you’re not open to understanding nuance when it isn’t your own viewpoint. When you perceived that I was doing the same thing, you got REALLY mad about it (classic projection AND you made some shit up along the way and got mad about THAT!). I don’t have any control over how you decided to feel about that, so you do you, booboo.

If you really wanted to know why I responded the way I did, you could’ve asked, instead of going off on a very wordy diatribe where you attempt to insult me (and really, what does that add to the conversation?) Based on that and your willful misunderstandings, I think you’re just comfortable being mad, and desperate to be right."

As for being on dating sites: when you break up with somebody, you realize very quickly that being alone is torturous and it’s natural to want to try to find someone to “fill the void”, even though that may not be the healthiest or most necessary step.

It is very true that people like to tear others down in order to feel better about themselves. Sounds like that is what is happening here. People love scapegoating others because it makes them feel morally superior. It’s like putting on a mask to blind themselves with, then blaming objects they knock over for being in the way.

They say the best revenge is living well. If you can defend yourself to the hospital a letter may be useful. It can be good to get your thoughts down on paper whether or not you actually send the letter.

If this situation turns out for the worse, I hope you can become employed somewhere that has a better environment. Best of luck to you! You’ve done a lot of great work for yourself and you should continue to be proud of the progress you’ve made, no matter what.

No matter what happens, keep going."
Meditation,fdbuu27,t3_ekgfjz,1578262321.0,"38M here, same thing happened to me about a year ago. I left my relationship of 7 years for mental health reasons (among other things) and became obsessed with thinking about her afterwards.

I could not meditate for a couple of months because every time I tried, thoughts about her would come flowing in at a million miles an hour and it was highly taxing emotionally.

I worked with a good therapist and worked on my mental health in many ways, and worked on becoming my own person. Found a good medication regimen (YMMV so I’m not explicitly endorsing this if not needed, everyone has different needs) and leaned on a few close friends for love and support. 

I am able to meditate again, and life is way better now. But it took awhile, as I imagine it will for you. You need to be patient with yourself and kind to yourself, as you will hit all kinds of bumps in the road on your journey. Keep at it, keep going, forgive yourself for inevitable backslides (VERY important - will help you recover quicker).
