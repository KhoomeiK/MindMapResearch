That's something a close friend told me and I took it for granted at the moment, but after time and more time I finally woke up one day and didnt have her name in my head.  time heals all wounds, you just have to find a way to pass it. And as bad as people can be toward us, we cant let that define who we are. And definitely dont let them ruin video games for you, since you know rdr2, you understand the length of that game and how you can be sucked into it for hours, hearing ""morgan"" for 80+ hours shortly after our breakup never stopped me once, only because I wouldn't let it. Believe me, I wanted to put it down but I felt like it was a trial of some sort and I took it as a challenge. I can proudly say I overcame it, regardless of how insignificant it may seem, it was a huge hurdle for me. You have the strength in you to overcome anything you just have to find it and hold onto it. Eventually it will be a mainstay. Above all, get yourself out of the house or invite people over.  Indulge in some sort of healthy hobby. Just pass some time.

Edit: I consider gaming a healthy hobby, just make sure that's not literally all you do lol."
BreakUps,ff9t99e,t3_esg2s2,1579720768.0,"I'm sorry you've been left feeling this way, I do understand how you feel though. My first love left me at the 11 month mark. Very close to our one year anniversary. She looked at me in the hallway, told me we needed a break, gave me my jacket back, and never texted me after. I was moving schools in that week so I guess it was her ""perfect timing"". Within a week my buddy tells me about her and this other guy I knew were bragging about how much sex they were having. The fact she wouldn't text me back, and that shes already moved on so fast just crushed me. We didnt have any major problems going on, it was like a light switched in her. I already have problems with throwing up(acid reflux) and this just made it 10x worse. 


Instead of calling her or waiting for her call in the morning (we'd always wake each other up) I was throwing up every morning. It sucked so bad. As cheesy as it sounds, I felt like she crushed my heart in pieces and just swept in up under the rug and there was nothing I could do about it. If you want to know what made all of this 100x worse, my most anticipated game of the decade was coming out, red dead redemption 2. Why was this worse, well the main protagonist had the same name as my ex... I didn't let that stop me though, especially after paying 90$ for the special edition.... and as ironic as it was, it wasnt over. I ordered a game called ""Prey"" shortly after because it was on sale. And guess what. The same fucking name. I felt like the universe was taunting me. So much for trying to escape my problems using video games. 


My ultimate escape was selling drugs, yeah not the best route. Take it from me, I didn't get caught or anything but I made some bad friends who didn't want the best for me. Luckily I got out pretty quickly when I started college. My biggest mistake though, trying to move on too fast. After about 4 months after the breakup I went on a date. It was great, except the second date we went way too fast. Before I knew it I had a relationship with someone I barely knew. It lasted longer than my last relationship, but toward the end I really got too see who I was with. And I didnt like her. I broke up with her and it actually went well. And you know after all of this, I still think about my first.


 I dont think we will ever forget the people we loved, even my bestfriend betrayed me in one of the worst ways, and I still think about him to this day. All we can do is learn to love ourselves and make the right decision for our well being. Find a hobby, maybe start a home gym? That's at least what I'm doing as of now. Just keep your mind occupied, listen to some sad music, then listen to some mad music. Find new bands, go to new concerts. Draw, paint, write motivational speeches or poetry and let no one ever read them. We have all of this time to ourselves, go make something you can be proud of out of it, and impress yourself."
