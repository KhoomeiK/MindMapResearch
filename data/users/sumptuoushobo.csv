relationship_advice,fgf2qxw,t3_ey4g84,1580721217.0,That is most definitely not what girlfriends or even spouses are like at all. You need to talk to her to see what's the root issue of her anger. Either way it isn't healthy for the relationship.
relationship_advice,fgd9y54,t3_exvq8u,1580680291.0,"You are in some serious denial OP. You ask for advice about s suspect situation and clear double standards. But then preface it with ""don't judge blah blah"". Either get over the fact that she is doing something hypocritical or just accept the fact that she is going on a dinner date with a co-worker and swallow that discomfort. LDR rely heavily on trust and understanding. The fact that she doesn't understand it makes you uncomfortable and isn't batting an eye that this dude is willing to keep his gf in the dark (allegedly), then he doesn't care about your relationship. Good luck either way. Personally the sheer number of LDRs that end in breakups, is the main reason I was never keen on them. That coupled with all those red flags is a no brainer."

relationship_advice,fgarggc,t1_fgajw58,1580654538.0,"I don't think OP wants advice because you gave a suggestion/opinion of the relationship as someone detached from his situation. And then he defends his situation when in the short post there are so many red flags. 
- constant breakups
- worrying about her cheating or not
- two STD's

Not sure of what more he wants honestly."
relationship_advice,fgaouvb,t3_exouqj,1580653820.0,"Not sure if you're asking for advice or not given the whole post didn't seem to be framed as a question. That being said, here is my two cents so to speak (take it or leave it). I feel like you should read your post to yourself out loud and take it from the point of view of someone else writing it and you are the one giving them advice.

From the outside looking in (again just my opinion), your boyfriend's actions are childish and toxic as hell. Just because he is kind in other aspects of your relationship, doesn't change the fact that he is being a dick head to your emotions and mental health. A partner regardless of sex or gender should want to be there for their significant other (whether that role is to be an active listener or problem solver). 

You should be with someone who makes you feel comfortable about opening up and doesn't make you feel as though you need to close your emotions off. Hell you shouldn't even feel fear of talking to your partner because of their angry reaction. Every human deserves happiness in life and their relationships.

So OP again reevaluate your current relationship, and try to be objective (like you would if a family member or friend would approach you for advice in a similar situation). Ask yourself if you truly want to live your life shutting off your feelings on top of suffering from depression. 

Also OP, please seek professional help for depression. Speaking from personal experience with depression it's such a relief when you're able to overcome the thing that hurts you and makes you feel the way you do. And just like the depression didn't happen over night, neither does the recovery. However, it is so worth it in the end. Not to say you won't have moments in the future of feeling depressed, you just won't feel like this dark and looming cloud is controlling your life. 

I hope you feel better, I hope you get better, and I wish you happiness / success in life. Take care of yourself OP (you've got to look out for your star player, and that's you)."
relationship_advice,fg81cm0,t3_exgbuy,1580606898.0,"If you two aren't on the same wavelength, then maybe you should evaluate your relationship. Because if you feel like he isn't the one after 8 months, 2 years, hell even 5 years, what would be the point sticking around? It's only going to be damaging emotionally for him, and mentally for you. If he can't respect that the ""jokes"" make you uncomfortable and stressed, it seems like he isn't emotionally mature in the relationship either. Marriage is a huge step and he should realize that. 

Not saying break up with the guy because it seems like that is all to often the suggestion here, as if the first sign of realness or hardship is met with ""oh just leave"" (I feel that's part of the high divorce rates, instead of working shit out but I digress), instead really have a heart to heart and ensure it sinks on with him. Then if after all that he doesn't understand, and you still don't think he is the one because you want to enjoy life and sow your wild oats. Well then do you for a bit before you settle down because you're young. No sense in settling down if you aren't ready."

relationship_advice,ff68ki8,t1_ff5xlmk,1579621674.0,You should check out her boyfriend's point of view. They are both toxic with each other and shouldn't be together. They both post on Reddit.

relationship_advice,ff5jc0o,t1_ff5i54e,1579595565.0,"This for sure, and worst case scenario if she doesn't reciprocate. Then do your best to make things less awkward after the fact. Good luck OP"
relationship_advice,ff5j6zv,t1_ff5hcwl,1579595370.0,"OP don't listen to this idiot who probably can't hold down a relationship. Just as others have pointed out, you compromised by changing when and how often you play. Shit next work on making her feel wanted, to make up for lost times so to speak. But if you love her following the guy below advice would be stupid. Also good luck with the network admin career, did that while waiting for a dev position. And it was a decent paying career. That's something else to consider going forward if for some reason you do decide to give up vg completely, you can use that time to go deep on network knowledge. 

This way you can secure a solid job that allows you more family time, and the ability to do things outside of the house together (especially if your wife felt that a cheap gym membership was an unnecessary expense). Anyway best of luck to you OP, and congrats on the baby."

offmychest,ff5i6sw,t1_ff5h5bd,1579594006.0,"100% this. She's gotta go into this expecting the worst and hoping for the best, because consciously she made the decision to do what she did knowing it was wrong. And actions have consequences. If it turns out positive cool, if not then take it as a life lesson and don't repeat past mistakes."
offmychest,ff5i1zs,t3_errdls,1579593828.0,"You should seek professional help to sort through the things that are making you feel the way you do. Mental health is a serious matter (speaking from experience), and should be addressed. While it's not a rapid change over night, it comes with time but is totally worth it. Also feelings of sadness or depression are feelings that everyone experiences throughout life. However, the severity of those feelings vary from person to person. Just know you're not alone! 

If at anytime you'd like to talk and vent to a random, unbiased stranger my inbox is always open. Just know that through this rough time in your life, that you matter and that you deserve to be happy."
relationship_advice,ff5hu84,t3_errdrk,1579593543.0,"Ones feelings can only be rejected so many times before the realization that there really is no chance in hell of things progressing positively, that he probably got fed up. It also depends on how you rejected him this last time, because it could have hit him the wrong way. If you want this to work out, just show up at his door so he can't avoid you, explain everything with no room for any other interpretation and then hope for the best. 

If he has ""licked his wounds"" so to speak, but still feels the same way, then that's a plus. However, if he is bitter and cuts you off completely, well then shame on him for not respecting the fact that you had said no (unless he had gotten mixed signals to believe you felt otherwise). That would be another thing to check him on as well, just because he couldn't get what he wanted by having you as a girlfriend, doesn't mean he should be immature and cut you off as a best friend. 

Anyway OP I wish you the best of luck and hope things turn out positively for you, whether that is you two end up dating or go back to being close. Looking forward to an update if you decide to."

People like you are awesome with the wisdom you share, because I know when I was younger I was blinded by stupidity. That or willful ignorance towards a similar situation to OP's. Either way solid advice, and keep on keeping on stranger."
relationship_advice,ff51x49,t3_erolvn,1579578004.0,"Pretty much what all of these other folks are saying. Express your concerns, and then try to work on your confidence. Because a lack of confidence is a turn off for women. And you don't want to keep pushing her towards the thing you fear the most. I've seen this quoted online, and it very well could be from a pornstar or an artists but ""a shoulder to cry on becomes a dick to ride on"". Not saying to be controlling because that isn't acceptable either. Just speak your mind because she shouldn't have to go outside of the relationship, to discuss issues inside of the relationship. That is something you two need to do. 

Hopefully she could empathize with you and realize her actions are making you uncomfortable, because despite any disagreement she might have towards a hypothetical, shoe on opposite foot situation. I bet she wouldn't appreciate if you did the same with another female."
relationship_advice,ff50gtc,t1_ff4sb4b,1579576926.0,"Again could be what I suggested (though that would be no gain for her unless she thrives off of chaos), that she wants to ruin something that is positive for him because she might be bitter in her own relationship.

relationship_advice,ff4s0qn,t3_ern7ne,1579571050.0,"Not to play devil's advocate, but he did show the message and response. If he had something to hide he would have been hiding it from you or secretive. There is always the possibility that she just started working in that area, creeped on him and is trying to fuck up his happiness because she is bitter."

AskNetsec,ff2si5v,t3_erb83a,1579522244.0,"If you're looking to save money on a home security system, your options are to either get the ones that you just mentioned, or look into raspberry pi cameras and use a program called motioneyeos (takes a bit of set up so that you could remote in when away from home). But if you don't mind spending money, look into ubiquiti unifi. For context I'm a new homeowner and wanted that same piece of mind that you did, so to outfit my home with a few cameras, some wifi gear that pairs with it nicely and a few of the other bits of hardware I needed to power the cameras/have a way to remote into them, I spent roughly $3,600 USD (covers my 1500sqft home, plus blindspots surrounding my home).
