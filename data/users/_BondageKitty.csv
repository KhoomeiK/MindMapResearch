Search Similarities between anime and wrestling. Wrestling is huge in Japan as well, and it's structured a little differently than over here. A lot more emphasis on ""fighting spirit"", which makes it even more like an Anime. Makes sense why they would be so similar, there's a lot of crossover fans"
AskReddit,ff9a2uo,t1_ff99d3z,1579708288.0,"Not sure who you mean, there are a few podcasts like that. Bruce Prichard is one of the more famous ones, but far as I know he never wrote for Star Wars. Do you remember what the podcast was called?"
AskReddit,ff99jld,t1_ff98g9x,1579707954.0,"The trope where the best friend betrays the protagonist and turns bad, sometimes aligning themselves with established antagonists. Wrestling Tag Teams have been breaking up like that forever. The trope where the hero is beaten and bloody while the villain gloats and toys with the hero, but then a friend or group of bystanders yell out that the hero can still win, which gives him the strength and determination to get up and keep fighting. That's the most basic form of Wrestling storytelling that exists. The Heel(antagonist) gets the upper hand,  beating down the Face(protagonist) for a while, until the Crowd starts cheering and showing support to the Face, giving them the will to get up and fight back, building up to the comeback and victory for the Face. That shit has been around since Wrestling still toured in Sideshow Carnivals.  
There are more, most of them minor and also appearing in other forms of media, but the fight-heavy nature draws a lot more parallels between Wrestling and Anime"
AskReddit,ff9689i,t1_ff924a8,1579705811.0,"There's a lot to it, any real discussion would take a really long time. At its most basic level, Wrestling is a very physical form of Theatre. There's drama, comedy, fight scenes, high impact stunt work, improv, crowd work, and blurring the lines between the fictional story and the real life people involved. On occasion, you can even find Shakespearean levels of tragedy and triumph, the retirement story of Ric Flair being a big example of something that is truly heartbreaking if you've been following Wrestling for a while up to that point.  
That's another thing, it's unique in the fact that the overall ""story"" never truly stops. You can follow a group of Wrestlers for years or even decades, from their early days to the twilight of their careers. Even after they retire, you may end up following the careers of their children and grandchildren as they try to carve out their own legacy in the shadow of the Legends that came before them. Ric Flair doesn't Wrestle anymore, but his daughter Charlotte is becoming a star on her own over the last few years. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson became arguably the biggest name during the late 90s before his current acting career, and before him his father and his grandfather were big names in their own respective eras.  
Yeah I rambled a bit there, and I barely scratched the surface. I didn't even get into the technical aspect of actually Wrestling or of telling a non-verbal story through your actions in the ring, or about how the Crowd factors into it, or about how Anime borrowed a lot of the tropes and storytelling elements from Wrestling. It's a huge topic lol"
AskReddit,ff94yig,t1_ff92rp3,1579704952.0,"That's not my only passion, just one of the bigger examples. I'm a pretty good cook with a couple of specialties that I'm proud of, musical taste is eclectic and something I feel on a visceral level (especially with Metal), I love ""bad"" movies especially when the acting and writing are so batshit crazy that it becomes hilarious, I used to write but currently trying to improve my drawing skills. I'm also a big fan of gaming in general, not just video games. Magic The Gathering, Chess, Cards Against Humanity, etc. Even Monpoly if you can believe it.  
The main issue is I don't know how to work any of that shit into a conversation without it being forced and awkward. Anxiety and depression make everything even harder in that regard, and takes a lot of the passion away over time"
