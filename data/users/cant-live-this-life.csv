sex,fdjzqv4,t3_elij0w,1578492413.0,"It sounds like she has some underlying issues with your relationship as a whole considering hoe she has left you without a chat for 2-3 days. Incredibly immature from her side. 

I remember I had a chat with my ex about porn and masturbating whike the other one slept. I (f24) even did that sometimes if I couldn't sleep too, and when he told me he did it I simply asked why he wouldn't wake me up to have sex (i have high libido, he was low due to pain etc). It was never an issue to watch port or masturbate. You're simply horny and looking at people pleasuring themselves. I think its inappropriate to make a fuss about it like she has. She made her thoughts of this entire thing more important than your well being (as you now feel disgusting and unwanted). 

Please talk to her, ask why it's bothering her, and reassure her that you only want her and don't mind if she touches herself when you're asleep. It's really no difference wanking in the toilet when she's sleeping (or next to her for that sake) than in another unit?.. i hope you figure it out, and as I said. I wonder if she has underlying issues??"
