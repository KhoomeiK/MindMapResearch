I didn't say it was.

Neither of the things you mentioned were what I was suggesting."

I think maybe my steam saves/data got corrupted, so it's unplayable now.  Shame."
TitanQuestAE,ffeyc5w,t3_esuvvx,1579870273.0,"I wonder if it fixes the bug where the whole game was unplayable (tried playing over the Christmas/New Years break, it was playable for a bit, with ever increasing issues and eventually it just would sit there not synching with Steam forever)."
Pathfinder,ffee7pe,t3_et44r4,1579844721.0,"I think the answer is yes in normal PF (increase duration to 24hours), but it requires some char-op hoops to be jumped through, and then excludes you from a bunch of much better char-op.

Not sure in PFS - I'm thinking grabbing the spell off the paladin list with Lorekeeper (???) as a for instance and I don't know if Lorekeeper is PFS legal."
SquaredCircle,ffee2bd,t1_ffedygu,1579844576.0,"They hover around about 700 usually IIRC.  And AEW around 900.

SquaredCircle,ffedk44,t1_ffdi3pg,1579844080.0,"No, the tag division in AEW is one of their major focuses.  It's not like WWE where it's an after-thought and Vince will just toss together two top singles competitors who have issues and make them a team and then have them go over the ...

SquaredCircle,ffed8s7,t1_ffd40cj,1579843782.0,I thought they were actually up on last week?  I expected the NXTites to be happy??
SquaredCircle,ffdsp0s,t3_essvk9,1579827948.0,"WWE announces today that all of Charlotte Flair's reigns have been deemed to be clerical errors and invalid.

A large fan movement has been organised in basements across the country as fans lobby to have all of Charlotte's now defunct reigns credited to Sasha Banks instead.

Leaked memo to performers indicates that going forwards chest slaps and the 'woo' taunt will be placed on the banned list along with moves like the piledriver."
SquaredCircle,ffdsa3l,t1_ffdi044,1579827664.0,"Whichever ones you are excluding (tag, divas, NXT) puts someone else on top of the list, so it seems like the only reason to exclude them is to end up with a very specific list.

In fact, you're excluding more titles (which people already on the list have held) than you're including.  That's why it's dishonest."
SquaredCircle,ffdof6k,t1_ffcc183,1579825199.0,"Add on the tag reign - it'll push her to three digits.

I think there was a point in time when Charlotte's combined reigns (800 days) were 10x Sasha's 80 days, and I used to point out how crazy that was."
SquaredCircle,ffdo7qq,t1_ffc2goq,1579825073.0,Asuka has more time on main roster as a champion if you include the tag belts.  The guy didn't include that because he's being disingenuous.
SquaredCircle,ffdnxsb,t1_ffc1joz,1579824906.0,"Yeah you can see the guy Stanning all over Sasha elsewhere in the thread.

I'd agree that Sasha (and Asuka!) should have more main roster stuff, but I wouldn't agree that the obvious thing to do is to lock Becky in a closet and toss away the key.  I don't think Becky is the problem here."
SquaredCircle,ffdnr3i,t1_ffbvlrm,1579824792.0,"She's the plucky underdog!

Hell, I think her and Nikki should clear house in the last ten and then Nikki tosses herself over as the last elimination all the while professing her undying love for Lexi.

SquaredCircle,ffdnkni,t1_ffbvf1z,1579824685.0,"> I remember all of Becky's reigns individually

I really like Becky, but I distinctly remember being surprised last year when I looked at the stats and saw that Becky had been the first Smackdown women's champion.

I think maybe that Charlotte might have been the RAW champ at that time???  And so Becky didn't really get any spotlight during that time?"
