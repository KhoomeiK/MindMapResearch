RelationshipAdviceNow,fdppeba,t3_elhh0k,1578635555.0,"OP, if you're not 100% comfortable with doing this, your boyfriend should respect your feelings and choice to not want to have sex with another man. He should not try to pressure you into doing something that you're not comfortable doing by continuously bringing it up. I say that as a guy that would love a girlfriend who was willing to be shared."
AskMen,fdpouii,t3_emh6y3,1578635007.0,"I'd be 100% OK with a woman (or anybody, really) asking to stick with me in public (especially if they were being harassed). 

I have younger sisters and I'd hope that somebody would help them to feel safer in that sort of situation."
AskReddit,fd7fv6l,t1_fd4je0i,1578203834.0,"I agree with the less petty drama. Girls, from my experience, can really blow things out of proportion and hold grudges over really basic things that guys would forget about or not even care about."

AskReddit,fd72ymr,t1_fd2xyoq,1578198779.0,"As a guy, I think it's a lot harder for us to open up as, unfortunately, people tend to judge us harshly for showing our emotions (particularly being upset). I know that I'd love to be able to open up, but my friends would absolutely mock me for it."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fd6vy5i,t3_ejojua,1578196410.0,"Hi, I'm a 20 year old guy who's going into my third year of studying a Bachelor of Commerce/Bachelor of Laws (Honours) at UoN. We seem to share a few interests and I am also looking to make some friends :). 

I'd be more than happy to give you my Kik, Snap, or WhatsApp to get to know you more. If you're interested, PM me."
CasualConversation,fcwtz8i,t3_ehrmyg,1578037528.0,True! The only genuine compliment I've ever received was two years ago when a random girl told me she liked my shirt. I still thought about it weeks later (and wore the shirt a lot more often).
lonely,fcwtbvt,t3_ehteay,1578036769.0,"Man, I feel this! I had the same thing happen to me a while back and I felt so good about it. It honestly did a better job of picking me up than the coffee!"
AskMen,fcwsxqz,t3_ejbueq,1578036318.0,"I been having a really rough time lately and don't have anyone who cares enough about me to just sit with me and listen while I vent. As a result, my mind races when I'm trying to sleep and just won't slow down. I've genuinely only been getting 1-2 hours of sleep a night."
SuicideWatch,fcwsh9d,t3_ej4wzo,1578035795.0,"Please don't hurt yourself. Coming from someone that has been sexually assaulted, I'm not going to lie to you and tell you it gets easier because it hasn't in my experience. 

Please speak to your brother! Despite the fact you've never been that close I can assure you that he loves and cares for you more than you think (I speak from experience here!). Perhaps you could live with him?"

AskMen,fcws2m6,t3_ecb8pn,1578035338.0,"I learned that you shouldn't apologise unless you are actually going to make changes to prevent what you did from happening again. I learned it late in the year, but it helped me give up alcohol and drugs which always ended up with me hurting people that didn't deserve it and feeling horrible about it later."
MMA,fcwru6n,t3_ej2pwm,1578035077.0,"If Khabib is ruled out, I'd like to see Conor vs Tony, but if Tony is ruled out, I'd rather see Gaethje step in to face Khabib."

nrl,fcstcn5,t3_eh4lvn,1577924595.0,RIP. This is so sad. Especially when he had people that would have been more than happy to help him.
Cuckold,fcst6d3,t1_fcokcjx,1577924474.0,Probably wouldn't happen as your boyfriend is living the dream!
AskReddit,fcssw85,t3_eihliz,1577924274.0,"Pretty much already been mentioned here, but:

1. Treating people with respect - Even when the person has nothing to offer them in return.
2. Calm when inconvenienced - I know a guy that blew a girl's phone up for being 5 minutes late (Thankfully he didn't get a second date).  
3. Respecting boundaries - I know some guys that have pressured, after being told 'no' multiple times, girls into smoking weed. Not cool!
4. Helping unfortunate people or animals - I was getting to know a girl and we went for a walk and she just stopped and gave a homeless guy the $20 she had in her purse (That $20 was a significant amount of money to her at the time).
5. Apologising/taking responsibility when they are wrong/make a mistake.
6. Being able to laugh at themselves."
AskMen,fcqde5m,t3_ehmkp5,1577883785.0,"The Good: I finally got the help I needed to start working on improving my mental health and I made the decision to cut out recreational drugs and alcohol which I used as a coping mechanism. Also, my grades were much better than I expected due to a lack of motivation.

The Bad: I had a few really bad schizophrenic episodes and, as a result, did things that I not only regret, but that I am ashamed of. I was horrible to an old acquaintance and basically ruined my already strained relationship with my siblings (both of these pushed me to finally do the good - it took me way too long to eventually to the good)

The Ugly: The schizophrenic episodes.

Things I really hope to accomplish in 2020: Continue with my Law and Commerce degrees; repair the relationship with my brothers and sisters (the most important one to me); and make better friends/start associating with less toxic people."
HumansBeingBros,fcq8knn,t3_eiavlp,1577881009.0,She's truly a great friend! I wish more people were like her.
offmychest,fcq1f0x,t1_fcpzsln,1577876652.0,"Thanks for responding. I know my friends aren't exactly the best people and those connections are toxic. I wish I had better friends, but unfortunately that's not the case. If I could make friends that weren't toxic and actually cared about me, I'd more than likely sever all ties with my current group to be honest."
mentalhealth,fcpza20,t3_ei5tc3,1577875360.0,"I waited just over two years and seriously wish that I hadn't. I basically ruined relationships with my siblings that I'd do almost anything to repair, but the damage has been done."
AskReddit,fcphqmf,t3_eakpp8,1577864626.0,"My biggest regret of 2019 is not getting my schizophrenia diagnosed earlier. I also abused alcohol and drugs which certainly didn't help and as a result I did a lot of really hurtful things that I regret immensely and wish I could take back. In particular, I really hurt a younger sibling with whom my relationship is already strained. 

However, I have recently stopped drinking and doing drugs altogether and combined with the medication my symptoms are a lot better, but I really wish I had done something about it earlier. I'm so ashamed of my actions. 2019 was by far my worst year alive."
offmychest,fcpgys8,t3_eibdao,1577863589.0,"Thanks. Happy New Year to you, too!"
SuicideWatch,fcpen5j,t3_eieold,1577860693.0,"I'm really happy for you, mate. I'm glad that you're in a really good place and I hope you have an incredible year."
AskReddit,fcpadrh,t3_eic8yl,1577856056.0,Absolutely! I would never touch alcohol or drugs; be a better big brother to my younger siblings; and try to make friends that actually care about me.
SuicideWatch,fcp90yx,t3_egyeqz,1577854570.0,"I feel the same way. This 'temporary' problem has lasted over two damn years and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon and at the end of the day a solution is still a solution, right?"
toastme,fcp8oao,t3_ehciak,1577854209.0,Good on you for having the strength to hold on. I'm glad that you're feeling better now :)
toastme,fcp6q8p,t3_ehbwop,1577852300.0,Just saw your update. I'm glad you survived. You deserve to live :)

AskReddit,fcoz1lp,t3_eibuyo,1577845549.0,"Pretty similar to Mimikyu's (Busted Form) entry in Pokémon Sun: *After going to all the effort of disguising itself, it’s still feeling sad.*"
SuicideWatch,fcmegqv,t3_ehosb6,1577772300.0,"Yes, and I'd probably be right."
dogs,fcme5qp,t3_eho07v,1577772006.0,I couldn't imagine how much worse I'd be without my bestfriend. Sometimes I'll just go and sit with him and he'll just walk up beside me and put his paw on my forearm or shoulder and just look me in the eye before coming in for a hug. Pretty much the only meaningful contact I get. I don't know what I'll do when he is no longer around.
SuicideWatch,fcm9t4f,t3_ehsio5,1577768135.0,"No, but it is a factor that I do consider. I really don't want my parents or my dog to die. As much as I'd like to wait them all out, I see myself tapping out way before then."
AskReddit,fclwaa6,t3_edn29x,1577758020.0,A genuine friend that will just sit with me and listen to me vent.
AskReddit,fclw27i,t3_ehidlt,1577757866.0,"I've been a lousy big brother. My younger siblings all get along really well and they are nice to me, but I know that they really hate me. I know that if I disappeared, they really wouldn't care. I'd love to be able to improve those relationships, but I know that it is really too late as the damage has been done and they couldn't care less about that as they have each other. Despite that, I'm really proud of them and love them all more than anything."
AskReddit,fclnj7d,t3_ehdm2z,1577751972.0,"Having a girl that actually cares about and loves me, but is also willing to be shared with other guys. I'd like to regularly get a bunch a guys and have really rough gangbangs with her."
AskReddit,fcjo5ed,t1_fciyk44,1577696162.0,"That's absolutely terrible. I'm glad that she's doing better now and I wish you both the best.

At my absolute worst, before I got medicated, I could absolutely see myself doing something like that. The thought of that truly scares the hell out of me."
AskReddit,fcjmyuf,t1_fciahbe,1577694521.0,"Smoking weed absolutely worsened my symptoms, which were pretty insignificant and very manageable, to the point where I was bombarded from the moment I would wake up to the moment I went to sleep. I can only hope that nobody ever finds out about my schizophrenia as it would almost certainly seriously jeopardise my potential career."
AskReddit,fcj0m18,t3_eh8gs2,1577674318.0,"In hindsight, it really worsened the symptoms of what has been now diagnosed as schizophrenia."

Sober,fciyivy,t3_egzho2,1577672890.0,This really does hit home for me.
SuicideWatch,fcisugf,t3_eh9um5,1577668988.0,"I'm so sorry that you're going through this. You and your brother in no way shape or form deserve any of this. You and your brother deserve to feel safe and loved in your own home. It's really sad that you Mum would take the side of this guy over her own children.

I really do not believe that your death would cause your Mum to leave the abusive guy or help your brother. Have you tried reaching out to other family members? Or even CPS? I really do hope that your situation improves :)"
SuicideWatch,fce21on,t3_ee66b1,1577616118.0,Yes! All the damn time! I fake a smile in front of my family because I want them to be happy more than anything and I feel like I'm completely fake around my friends just to fit in.
SuicideWatch,fcdjcaa,t3_egwcs1,1577610532.0,"You DO have so much time ahead of you, OP, and not having a relationship at 19 is nothing to be embarrassed about. That's perfectly normal. Have you reached out to your sisters and told them how you feel? If you haven't, please do! You're lucky to have siblings as no matter what, they'll always be there for you! I don't know you, but based on this post you come across as very well written and intelligent :) so I disagree with the claim that you have achieved nothing. I seriously hope that your situation improves considerably."
SuicideWatch,fcd0606,t3_eh02ub,1577604734.0,I'm sorry for your loss.
SuicideWatch,fcczqrn,t1_fcb3skz,1577604587.0,"I'd rather someone open up and tell me if they were struggling than bottle it up to avoid coming across as attention seeking. To be honest, even if someone was seeking attention that bad I'd be happy to give them that attention and listen to them."
AskReddit,fccin17,t3_egmzhl,1577598819.0,"I have really bad schizophrenia that has been unbearable for the past 12 months or so due to being unmedicated. As a result, I've been a severely broken man behind closed doors. It has such a bad stigma and I think my friends as well as the general public would absolutely judge me negatively for it. I've recently started taking medication and gotten sober which has helped me to manage it much better than before."
AskReddit,fcc9g9b,t3_egyz0p,1577595864.0,I would never touch alcohol or drugs.
AskReddit,fcc6ix6,t3_egxsnu,1577594971.0,I'm a guy in his early 20s and my friends and acquaintances would never let me live it down if they found out that I absolutely love going to see shows at a heritage-listed theatre in my current city as well as going to art galleries. I will almost find an excuse to visit those types of places.
schizophrenia,fcc1ajf,t3_e0sf20,1577593283.0,"Wow! What a creative way to deal with an episode. It looks amazing! Congratulations on the eight months without self-harming, too! :)"
SuicideWatch,fcbgssx,t3_cbk8i7,1577586678.0,"Yeah. I'm in my early 20s and whilst I've had cheap hookups, I'll never get to experience a proper, loving relationship, despite improving myself quite a bit recently. I'm at university and see loads of people my age in relationships and being truly happy as opposed to just, for the most part, appearing that way on the outside and it makes me feel horrible. There is a girl at work that is really sweet, kind, and funny and I really look forward to seeing her, but deep down I know that she is just being polite and is probably repulsed by me."
SuicideWatch,fcbd1y0,t3_egor46,1577585377.0,"I saw your post from yesterday, mate. You're not alone. Never give up. Don't give in. You've gotta put your head down and continue to push forward. Nothing worth doing ever came easy."
MMA,fcaz9t9,t3_egvtjc,1577579559.0,It's such a joke that USADA can get away with persecuting two clearly natty boys like Paulo Costa and Yoel Romero.
AskReddit,fcaxqqn,t3_egtceb,1577578699.0,I'm doing a lot better than I was two months ago thank you for asking :). I'm 50 days sober today (alcohol and drugs) and after officially being diagnosed with schizophrenia have been managing it to the best of my ability :).
