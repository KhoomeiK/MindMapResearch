doctorwho,fcxacpw,t3_eimwfk,1578057247.0,"The drum beating in the trailer, that means this could be a nod to the master before, but since it happened more than once in the trailer that's unlikely. It could be the master BEFORE the drumming stopped, but as we've seen almost every incarnation so far I doubt it. It could also mean it's a different master from a different universe, but I feel like is too simple and the doctor could comprehend this. 

Personally, I think when missy died, she entered the matrix and I think that's where yaz was and the doctor is at the end of the episode. How else would the master be able to disguise as a certain person for that long if you can't control who you regenerate into, so I think each of the white things is the master but without a body, and the master that we saw is just the same but was the first one here and found a body and made one"
