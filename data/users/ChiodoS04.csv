AskReddit,ffd4hfg,t1_ffc0yoo,1579813245.0,"Part of it is confidence, I am very good at making stupid things sound real.  It’s just how you present yourself in a conversation and having the ability to adapt quickly to what’s going on.

My wife and I went to a local restaurant that is great, they have tapas plates so you spend about an hour there sampling different foods.  This married couple sat next to us, then they started their divorce conversation, like it seemed like it was the first time they were bringing it up.  By the end the husband was in tears, he didn’t start the convo and our whole area was in a awkward silence."
