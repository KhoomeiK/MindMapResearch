NBA2k,ff9m03b,t3_esbabi,1579715806.0,"I think it was a lot worse last year. There were times when the game sat me down and said:

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen. You‚Äôre playing the suns, you‚Äôre going to lose, and it‚Äôs not going to be close. Your team will regularly abandon a play to take a contested mid range shot. They will struggle to get back in transition, and the opponents will make a full court pass with laser accuracy to an open center in the paint. This will happen multiple times. They will not miss contested shots. Your team will miss 40% of their free throws. They will miss wide open shots, on the rare occasion that they get them. You will not be able to defend without fouling. Your team will also give up lots of turnovers and forget how to dribble the ball. Any questions?‚Äù

This year it‚Äôs hard to tell, I‚Äôve only played on good teams so far and it‚Äôs honestly hard to lose, even if I‚Äôm not trying very hard to win. My first character, a SG for the bucks, only averaged like 16/3/6 and we blew out almost every game because Giannis is so OP, and we ended up only losing like 6 games, it was honestly kind of ridiculous."
