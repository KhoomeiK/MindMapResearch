Voting fraud is extremely rare and those cases that do exist tend to be mistaken - like someone mails an absentee ballot in and then dies before the election takes place. 

Most of the allegations of voter fraud come when a party loses an election and want to accuse the other side of cheating.  

This story has come in various forms over the years but basically goes like this: <opponent> filled up a <mass transport> with <currently hated minority> to vote under someone else's name.

Union busting is bad for employees. How can a union effectively represent you if they can't afford to pay representatives and arbitrators? That's a terrible thing for worker's rights - that should be front page news as the actual worst decision he's made.

He killed a terrorist known for killing Americans... in a way that galvanized Iranians against America. It isn't that Soleimani didn't deserve it, but there's more to fighting terrorism than just cutting the head off of a Hydra.

He's not saying senior leadership participated in the fraud, but that they weren't paying enough attention to spot it. I think that's important for the credibility of the FBI. Poor oversight can be corrected, but total corruption can't.

I'd also argue that the indictments and subsequent convictions prove that their efforts weren't targeting innocent people.

I never gave my stance on abortion - just that DJT hasn't addressed it and it's a hot-button issue (which, of course, is true). He hasn't taken them away. He hasn't clarified them. He's done nothing.

The thing with Iran isn't just because Trump is bad and Iran is good. Iran is bad, and Trump has made the situation worse.  Before, Iran was largely split on their government's actions and a split public leaves room for diplomacy. Trump's strike united Iran against the United States which takes diplomacy off of the table entirely.

The Mueller Report showed more than 100 contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia, but no evidence showed a definitive link to election interference (as in, no clear evidence Trump's campaign ordered it or asked for it). Russia still interfered on Trump's behalf.

The IG report is pretty nuanced, and I think you are reading into it too much. ""The FBI"" wasn't abusing the FISA process. ""A few agents"" made some unethical decisions. One agent altered the content of an email - which may be illegal (and probably is, but no verdict is made yet). No evidence was found that senior leadership was aware of the misconduct. The IG suggested that the FISA process has some holes he doesn't like and thinks it's too easy to obtain a surveillance warrant.

I didn't include it for two reasons - 1. Obviously, wasn't Trump's doing. 2. It's an ongoing story (we are gonna get a Durham report) and I think it's still too fresh for a factual basis to exist yet.

It really depends on the individual and the reason for their depression, as well as their level of self-awareness and their ability to fend off their destructive impulses.

1. Take extra time to meditate on the best parts of my day.
