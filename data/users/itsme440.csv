Gastritis,ff5bseb,t3_erppxe,1579586514.0,"I think I got gastritis from stress, anxiety and my diet. Not eat anything spicy/ spur really really helps. I think not stressing also helps because I feel better now that I am on vacation then when I’m in school"

AskReddit,ff5b8gz,t3_ero8mj,1579585955.0,I’d say glad because I got into college (something I didn’t think I’d have the opportunity to do).
AskLosAngeles,ff5auxh,t3_ericb3,1579585585.0,I’ve lived on LA all my life. Been single for a little over a year and I’d say that at the beginning it’s hard not being in a relationship but as time progresses it is actually very nice being single. I have more time to meet friends and other people. I don’t have to let a boyfriend know who and when I’m hanging out with someone because I don’t have one lol. I don’t get into arguments or drama or have someone be jealous. Everything is much more simple and you have more freedom. I’ve picked up hobbies that I wouldn’t have if I were to have been in a relationship
