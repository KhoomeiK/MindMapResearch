What you did is different in my eyes. You explained your son that it is okay to fall down, that he can get up, the pain will fade and fear is something that can be overcome and go back to running, and that you will always be there to help him (not do the work for him, just support).

AskReddit,ffqvh4z,t1_ffqm2o5,1580144563.0,"The first step would be to figure out how or why the angry wolf is fed. What is making your life miserable. And don't blame it on external factors, but do some real searching inside of yourself to figure out what is making you angry or sad about things in life. 

Like you aren't angry at the way others drive. Being angry at people for how they act is not really a reason. You might be angry because you are not allowed to act that way. Or are worried that others find out you already did act in a certain way in the past.

You could also try to focus on the different markets. Like China (Eastern market) Vs. America (western market). Who is playing (demographics), how much do they spend, on what are they spending, what is the difference between the two.

Kinda curious what determines if they can do it or can't though. Is it like predetermined or can it be trained. You know, the good old nature Vs. nurture argument?

Boardgames are a good example since they require you (depending on the game of course) to juggle a lot of mental tasks like checking your moves against the established rules, estimating the impact and chance of success of the move, trying to think ahead, remembering what cards/events are still in the piles and so on.

They also force you at times to think on your feet. Make quick decisions and live with the consequences. It's like MMA for your brain."

AskMen,fe1s34g,t3_engwr9,1578830274.0,"I think it is easier to say you are proud about not being involved then to admit that you are devastated, but can't spare the time since you need to work two jobs in order to pay all the bills with your partner staying at home taking care of the child. Not to mention need to save up a reserve for future expenses like medical bills, school and the like.


Of course that is not always the case, but I know some fathers who act like they are happy about having to work and not take care of ""lowly"" parenting activities, because they do not want to admit the alternative.

While tax law is quite daunting, loans are not that hard to understand. It all is basic math and gets covered in class over and over. At least here it was that case. 

People do get the tools they need but somehow they do not know how to use it. I was there myself. During schooltime everything is more important than the stuff some random old person wants you to learn. Because, be serious, teachers know nothing of live. The children in their glory and with the life experience of a 14 year old know how the modern world works.  It those old fossils who try to teach antiquated stuff like math.

It is somewhat hard to explain in written form, at least in a short enough version. Very, very simplified, you have to figure out what is causing your issue/troubles, see what thoughts/feelings are generated by it and then always question them whenever you feel them. 

At first you will mostly think about it one out of hundred times, but you get better at it and more in control.
