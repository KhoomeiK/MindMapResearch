Somehow I got lost on the test route, and ended going for about 2 miles on a narrow, bumpy, stone wall lined road. (it was on the Isle of Man)  I eventually realized I was going the wrong way, turned around, and sped up because I figured they were wondering where I'd gone with their bike. It became apparent that the bike was not in contact with the road all the time, it was sort of skipping along the high points. Didn't seem to bother the bike at all, perfectly composed, and still fairly comfortable ride. I checked the speedo, ""115 mph! Holy shit!""

BMW  motorcycles were not known for being the fastest, but what speeds they could attain, they could do all day, and with great comfort and poise, and very little drama."

teslamotors,ffichsa,t3_etsfa4,1579970594.0,"Tesla is working hard for efficiency, in all things. That means only spending money when they need to. The semi will be in ""limited production"" this year, that probably means essentially hand building the first ones. I'm thinking that the only piece of fixed ""production line"" at the moment, is maybe the battery module assembly. Ditto Roadster. Elon is not going to rush into installing the actual production line, until they have a good handle on the issues. With battery production, the Maxwell tech allows a *much* smaller footprint, and higher throughput. They are probably close to figuring out the layout, so now we are approaching the time that they can layout the factory(ies) to accommodate it, but with the numbers they are planning, they need to have access to a much increased raw materials source. If they go with Sigma in Brazil, the mine has to be close to production before they can move forward. And so on...

GF4 is pushing ahead as fast as they can move within the German bureaucracy, and they seem to be making the right moves there. The meeting with local environmentalists seems to have been well received, good sign. We're not seeing everything, I am certain that things are happening under the surface that will be leaking out over this year, and I expect a lot of people to go ""Woah, how did you get that done?"" Remember the original version of starship? Everyone was still wrapping their head around the concept of huge carbon fiber craft, and Elon says, ""Oh, by the way, the first test tank is done"" and puts up that picture. OK, they scrapped that idea, but the point stands.

Elon, SpaceX, and Tesla move *very* fast, but Elon now listens a bit better to his team when they say, ""Yes, we want to get that done as well, but can we have a little more time to think through the issues, and test the practicalities?""

The difference in range is around 200 miles, but only approximately, because they are not being very specific on range, it could be 305 vs 525 or 325vs 505, so no help there. The motors are cheap, compared to ICEs, but what it costs Tesla, and what they *charge* for it....

My guess is that the single motor will be 110 kWhr, the dual might get by with the same, and the extra range given by the more efficient front motor. The tri motor will be....180-200 kWhr. Mostly guesswork, but that's the sort of numbers I'm thinking of. Price difference is $20,000 and I'd think the extra complexity and extra motor is worth around $10,000? (that includes more luxury items) so $10,000 difference for around 90kWhr? That's what they're *charging* the customer, so they pay less. That puts it around $110/ kWhr retail, which would sort of line up with $85-90 cost at *pack level* for Tesla. Mostly inventing numbers here, but those are the sort of figures Tesla ***needs*** going forward. Who knows if they can do it? <shrug> My feeling is that by now, Elon is getting more confident with the projections, he knows how development is going on the new battery tech, chemistry, fabrication, production line engineering, even where he will find the *raw materials*!

teslamotors,feg5xp0,t1_feg33wj,1579078461.0,"So, from what I remember, pundits were predicting a long range battery of around a MegaWatt? 1,000 kWhrs?

That being so, is it reasonable to infer that the difference between standard and long range is 500 kWhr? Which then infers the battery cost at $60/ kWhr?"

teslamotors,fef619x,t3_eotzm6,1579049019.0,Some very prophetic statements. Could you give an example of something he got wrong?
unpopularopinion,feeno5x,t3_ejjmi5,1579037429.0,"I think most women dress to ""fit in"" just as much as men, but you do get more women that step outside the box than happens with men, and I agree it is mostly insecurity. When I started wearing skirts at work, (I'm a guy and I frankly don't know where I got the nerve the first time) but after the first day, my confidence level soared! And strangely, I felt more masculine, who knew?"
streetwear,feem7b6,t1_feekjcu,1579036582.0,"Most of *them* wouldn't be concerned about showing their disdain. I do feel I'm fortunate in where I live and work. Anyway, IDGAF about what they *think*, if you can call it thinking."

streetwear,feeldm0,t1_fbizehy,1579036102.0,"LOL, I found my favorite skirt across the street at a local thrift store, plaid, but not tartan, (it's diagonal!) Nice wool material, just the right length. I took it home and straight away put it on to show the GF, she liked it straight immediately, then I plunged my hands into the very roomy pockets. ""Ooh! I can make that fit me you know! ""   ""Get away! It's mine!"""
streetwear,feekv8s,t1_fbinhip,1579035805.0,"A bit goth/emo for my taste, I don't own one, but check out ""unaligned skirt"" for an example of a typical look for me. I'm still experimenting with what works or not, so I buy most from thrift stores. The experiments are cheaper, and you find all sorts of different looks to work with."
streetwear,feekgk9,t1_fbisxag,1579035565.0,"Depends on your local. I've had zero problems. I would expect other places would be different, but I know of one guy who wears much longer and looser skirts than I do, in the bible belt of all places, and he hasn't got into any fights or major confrontations.

In summer, when I tend to wear hiking skirts, they are quite often not noticed at all, people see what they expect, and they often see them as shorts."
streetwear,feejv2m,t1_fbiyj5v,1579035222.0,"This depends on the skirt, how it works with anything else you're wearing, and where you live."
streetwear,feejq1a,t1_fbik5pj,1579035141.0,"I'm sure some think that way, but from my experience they don't all think that way, I'd guess it's a small %. Very, very, few ever say anything negative, or even show negative expressions. Those that do say anything, almost without exception, are complimentary. YMMV."
streetwear,feej761,t1_fbivb77,1579034838.0,"I always always wear something under, if for no other reason than I have to use ladders at work. :o)  

I still find that light stretch briefs are plenty comfortable when worn with a skirt, for me, the issue with regular pants (trousers) is you end up with at least two layers bunching up around your bits, it's annoying. A single layer of stretch fit is not. Yoga pants and leggings are OK as well, but have to wear them with long shirt or tunic."
streetwear,feeijzt,t1_fbjw51k,1579034464.0,"It depends on fabric and fit. Agree it isn't usually an issue, but I'm not buying a fine knit pencil skirt anytime soon. :)"
streetwear,feei5ux,t1_fbik47f,1579034237.0,"Thank you, I have worn other lengths, but yes, somewhere from just above, to slightly below center of kneecap seems to be the right length. If I go longer, I'm usually wearing it for some sort of formal gathering."
streetwear,feehvha,t1_fbijr8x,1579034071.0,"Depends on the skirt. Fabric, shape, pleats or not, pattern. If not tucking, (which I don't do) you can discern *something* occasionally, but if you pay attention, you can make out just as much through pants, it's just more noticeable on the flatter, wider expanse of a skirt. My feeling is that as long as things aren't *obvious*, nobody seems bothered. Certainly nobody has commented, and I've not caught any staring."
streetwear,feeh9hi,t1_fbijo5r,1579033719.0,"I'm a guy and have been wearing skirts for a few years now. I've gone as far as getting a long down coat and knee high boots to wear riding the bus to work so I wouldn't need snow pants in -30C weather. I started with light hiking skirts in Summer, but found that wool skirts and tights give me more flexibility in Winter as well.

So far, I've had no issues, most people seem accepting, many are quite positive about it. I do think I'm fortunate in where I live and work, YMMV. On a visit to my sister in Ontario, she really didn't want me wearing skirts there, as the small town is more conservative, it did feel that way, but I feel the worst would have been some dirty looks.

I get most stuff at thrift stores, and I am careful about fabric, colour, and cut of the skirts, they usually have some sort of kilt vibe, or utilitarian look. I usually pair them with button up men's shirts, and my overall look has bit more business like, or formal."
AskReddit,fee9usc,t3_ekxlif,1579029380.0,"Think about this. Would your hands be warmer in gloves made of fairly thin denim, or in wool mitts? Not totally the same, but you would be surprised how warm a wool skirt and tights can be, particularly when you wear a longer coat and tall boots. Granted, if you're wearing a waist length jacket, short skirt, and sheer tights/pantyhose, you're gonna be cold."
AskReddit,fecfhjh,t1_febmn45,1578972665.0,"There are a huge variety of dresses and skirts. While, as I say, most dresses won't work for a typical male form, there are some that do. Shirt dresses are the ones that I've had best luck with. A simple shape with no, or not much flare.

There are already some skirts specifically designed for men, or unisex. Look up ""unaligned skirt"" it's quite similar to some skirts I've picked up in thrift stores."
AskReddit,febkqs2,t1_fe9l3yf,1578959844.0,So what do you think of men who wear dresses or skirts?
