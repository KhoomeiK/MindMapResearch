But once a fossil fuel company is in trouble for being liable for the environmental damage they do, they simply move the money around and close their shell company. Cant sue or come for reparations against a defunct business. 



Everywhere in Appalacia there's acid mine drainage, missing mountain tops, and huge degradation of the top soil. Fracking brings a local area's crime rates (drugs, violence, and hookers) through the roof due to the amount of trucks that then go in and out of rural places that otherwise wouldnt see so much as a quarter of that traffic. 




Those companies promised so much to those communities in exchange for their coal (and now natural gas). But the last time meaningful infrastructure change was actually delivered was by FDR in the New Deal. Otherwise, those company's legacies are largely the ecological devastation they leave behind. 



Those that still believe in fossil fuels in Appalacia (of which there are many) seem to focus in on one of the two actual economic terms the GOP seems capable of pronouncing anymore: debt and employment. 



What they wont admit is that the fossil fuel companies themselves to everything in their power to automate the jobs. It's not Mexicans taking your masculinity and jobs; it's literally your employer.

To me, I dont want anyone to have to prove to me that they are worthy of my help. And yes, that means sometimes the help will be taken advantage of. I'm okay with this. Because your means of community engagement has had its chance. All of American history, for example, built on puritanical principles of charity. And it has never, once actually taken care of everyone. It has never been enough. The safety net needs to be institutionalized. Because yes any government has its drawbacks but it provides largely without bias compared to an individual. I do not want any Americans to die in the gutter, even if they are politically the opposite from me or actively slander me.
