submechanophobia,fffq3nh,t3_et8a71,1579889353.0,Oh that’s a Russian B-39! You can go check out a completely intact one at the San Diego Maritime Museum.

wholesomememes,femdyar,t1_femduw7,1579250544.0,"That’s true, but I really don’t think a subreddit that’s meant to make people feel happy about themselves and others is the best place to start arguing about politics and religion. All I’m trying to do is make you feel good about yourself and if you don’t like my methods then just downvote and keep moving on."
wholesomememes,femdqmu,t1_femdk9y,1579250245.0,"I think God thought we needed Hitler. If it wasn’t for him starting World War 2, we wouldn’t have nearly as good of technology’s a we do now."
wholesomememes,femdoyw,t1_femdldb,1579250182.0,"Jeez I thought this subreddit was supposed to be wholesome. 

Anyway, yes I think God saw that everybody needed a place here on earth because those evil people would trigger events in history that would ultimately change humans for the better. If it weren’t for Hitler starting World War 2, we wouldn’t have half the technology we have today."
wholesomememes,femd9pn,t1_femd8ul,1579249592.0,"That’s okay!

Apology accepted."
wholesomememes,femcy96,t1_femcuid,1579249161.0,"Oh no here we go. People have to bring politics into everything don’t they?

Yes. I do think he thought that about Trump, and I think he thought that about Bernie and all of the other democrats and republicans."
unpopularopinion,fekkz3a,t3_ep8dzj,1579202221.0,"This reminds me of the Filthy Frank video about anti smoking ads. What he said still rings true. It was something along the lines of “these people are underestimating teens, and teens are gonna do whatever the fuck they want.”"
unpopularopinion,fekiq1j,t3_epahgf,1579200879.0,Honestly I so agree. If Hitler didn’t use it I could totally see a designer brand using the Swastika as their logo.

PublicFreakout,fefyh9o,t3_eowcft,1579069498.0,I remember seeing that specific airsoft revolver model at airsoftcon in LA.

insanepeoplefacebook,fee1wzi,t1_fee1m04,1579024686.0,I’ll be sure to consider that! Voting age here in the US is 18 but people are trying to lower it to 16.  Thanks for being nice!

insanepeoplefacebook,fecdo8w,t1_feccwt6,1578971448.0,Are you saying that all republicans believe we should kill Muslims?
insanepeoplefacebook,feccmqg,t1_fecb8ar,1578970805.0,"If the Republican Party told me we need to slaughter all Muslims, of course I’d say no. I’m perfectly capable of thinking freely, and the conservative  ideas seem the most logical to me. And like I said before, if there are democratic candidates that appeal to me, then I will vote for them."
insanepeoplefacebook,fecbkul,t1_fecbcvg,1578970203.0,"Theoretically speaking then, (and I would never do this) I could burn an LGBT flag and then tell everyone that is outraged by this that “it’s a flag... it’s not that deep.”"
insanepeoplefacebook,fecaw8l,t1_fecaago,1578969819.0,"Ummm... and you guys don’t? If Leftists love America so much, then why are they burning the flag and kneeling for the National Anthem?"
insanepeoplefacebook,fec9v12,t1_fec9k3l,1578969243.0,"Not yet, I’m only 15. It would all depend on what the other Republican candidates (or Democrat, if any of their candidates appeal to me) are at that time. If I don’t like them, then sure I’ll vote for Trump. If I like a different candidate, then I’ll vote for them instead of Trump. Besides, what does it matter if I vote for Trump or not? I have many friends who have voted for Trump and they’re very nice people."

offmychest,fdod82o,t3_eloypz,1578603014.0,"I have to say, green tea leaves (not a bag, the leaves themselves) along with a preferred amount of honey to sweeten things up a bit is a delight to the senses. Be careful, green tea has lots of caffeine and the honey doesn’t really help with that so don’t drink too much before sleeping!"
unpopularopinion,fdoch36,t3_emc6pg,1578602658.0,"My strategy is to get a paper towel and place on your open palm, and then open the door like you would normally.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdbc0sl,t3_ekapht,1578255907.0,I remember a friend of mine stayed back after being evacuated for fires with his police vest and arsenal of weapons. Unfortunately I don’t think he caught and looters.
PublicFreakout,fcw27zd,t1_fcvu2zb,1578015446.0,Why though? They do their best to protect people from danger and then get shit on by people like you.

airsoft,fc7zhzi,t3_egc0ew,1577522807.0,What’s that scope called? Quick story time. There’s a shooting range in Las Vegas called Battlefield Vegas and I shot an HK416 with the exact same setup as yours and I’ve been trying to find that scope ever since I’ve gone there.
memes,fc7y5dr,t3_egm5u4,1577521752.0,Is anybody reminded of Dingo from “Cars and Trucks and Things that Go” by Richard Scary when seeing this?

EntitledBitch,fc12bq4,t1_fbzck86,1577306243.0,What I love about this is that she’s still getting smashed for the cookie video. That video is four years old now and I still see people commenting on her more recents videos about it.
