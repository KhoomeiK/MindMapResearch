2. Cancel the apprenticeship and become a blacksmith instead."

I just wanted to make the transaction and dip but he keot attempting to do smalltalk and it went like this.


Him: Hey how are you?

Me: Good thanks and you?

Him: Same. Its cold isnt it?

Me: Yes.

Him: Have fun smoking.

Me: Thanks (YoU tOo (cringe))

Him:Aight see you, man.

Me: Yeah cya.



Edit: The point wasnt him being lonely or me being unfriendly (which I wasnt, I just didnt really know what to say tbh), it was only about the awkward interaction between us lel"

depression,fdaoog2,t1_fdahwvs,1578248495.0,"I dont completely hate my job.



Honestly i actually kinda enjoy most of it.



But the times are pretty bad.



Not regular night shift- bad, but still.



Often I come home at like 8:30pm.
Only to go to bed at around 10pm.
So I havr almost no ""me- time""
I also work on Saturdays.
Every saturday.



Fridays are my day off instead which isnt bad at all but of course none of my loved ones are free from work/ school on this day so I spend the day alone.



I used to workout every day for 1h+.
But now I'm way too exhausted when I come home.
Even when I'm home at around 6 on school days.
And one thing I fucking hate about my parents is how un-understanding they are.
As if this wasnt understandable.



Im trying to figure out when I can work out again, trying to find times, fitting my work- life ""balance"".



Well idk man I'm so unhappy at the moment.



Im also pretty much a wageslave now.
I literally make 5 fucking euros per hour.
Because for some reason people thought it was okay to exploit apprentices like that.



Idk if I'll be able to make it to the end.
2,6 years left."
