Aquariums,ff7lhj2,t1_ff7kyhc,1579652389.0,"i don’t know much about those guys specifically, but i’d recommend looking up “bala shark care sheet” on google and there’s a lot of great information. a quick search said their minimum tank size is something like 100 gallons so you might just want to see if there’s a store around you that can take them in and you can do whatever you want with the tank"

bettafish,fde40ws,t3_ekwvtz,1578330690.0,"i’d recommend a few corydoras, they like to be in groups of at least three or more, and they do better with sand instead of gravel because of their sensitive little barbs on their mouths. also would recommend something like tetras or danios, anything tropical that doesn’t have too long of fins bc the betta could nip their fins or vice versa"

bettafish,fd5v67x,t1_fd5e4ut,1578181894.0,"like others have said, add more silk decor to his tank and make sure that there’s nothing in his tank currently that could be snagging his fins. definitely suggest indian almond leaves, they release tannins into the water which stain it a light to dark brown color based on how many leaves you put in. i would suggest one to two leaves at a time and replace before they’re too decomposed. you could also boil a few leaves, let it cool and use that as an indian almond leaf tea so you don’t have the leaf litter."
