All he did was cleaning the PCB and removing a destroyed cap. He did NOT remove any chips. He did NOT separate the CPU from the flash. The CPU (SoC) and Flash are both on the top board. That works when the board is not seriously damaged.

He actually simply repaired the phone, without using any spare parts.

Only skimmed the second video. She's talking about swapping a top and bottom board. Again, not a problem - the chips you need are both on the top board. Swapping the bottom board is like keeping the CPU and hard disk in a computer but swapping the mainboard underneath. In a later part she removes a chip, but I believe that's on the bottom board.

Both these videos show recovering *while having both relevant chips*. If I missed where they say it's possible without, please tell me where.

Edit: I see; the issue may be with my claim that you need to move both to a new board. Of course if the phone still works you just need to turn it on, and if the board has minor damage you can choose to repair the board itself.

I suspect the water damage the phones they repair have is significantly less than what a non-waterproof phone will have after days (or 3 months, if it was recovered when the ship was raised) of immersion in saltwater.

If it gets to swapping chips (because the board is not salvageable), you *need* the CPU, and soldering these chips sucks.

Yes, this virus could be bad. Just like H1N1 (Swine Flu), H5N1 (Bird Flu), SARS, and Ebola.

H1N1 killed 4000 people in the US in 2009, i.e. in the US you were ""only"" ~7 times more likely to die from a car accident than H1N1 that year.

Yes, Y2K (the ""year 2000 problem"") could have been bad. The current consensus in the professional community is that it wasn't - not because it was a non-issue, but because we recognized the problem, *and fixed it*.

Yes, the Australian bushfires are bad, and while multiple aspects (e.g. how early they happened) may be unprecedented, the total area burned (so far) is a fraction of what burned in the 1974/75 season (117 ha back then vs. ~19 ha now).

Firefox is *probably* slightly less good than Chrome in terms of hardening, patching speed, deployment speed, overall polish etc., but Chrome is a much bigger target (much more users) than Firefox. Overall, Chrome is probably better at keeping its web store clean and is more locked down (giving users less freedom, which includes less freedom to do dumb/dangerous things).

Your personal concerns are different from a company's concerns. For example, you personally don't care about pushing policies to all computers, while a large business does. You're probably fine with dealing with sites broken by an ad blocker, you can't expect everyone in a company to be.

The biggest risk is social engineering. If you can distinguish a legitimate software update notification from something trying to trick you to install malware, you've gone most of the way. Blocking ads is a good way to reduce the amount of social engineering your users will be exposed to - important e.g. when setting up computers for less savvy family members.

Overall, on today's web, you're *mostly* safe as long as you update your browser in a timely manner and know what the critical ""you are allowing dangerous things"" flows look like (installing extensions, executing downloaded things) and can resist the temptation. The browser doesn't matter here.

The next level of protection is an ad blocker. This will not only make your web experience bearable again, it will also drastically reduce the questionable code that can reach your browser. Again, doesn't matter which browser as long as you can run a good ad blocker.

At this point, **you can pick a browser according to your personal preferences.** Want your tab bar on the side? Well, you're not getting that with Chrome, so Firefox it is. Want to use Microsoft stuff? Go for it (Chromium-based Edge, **absolutely not any of the legacy stuff!**). If the attack is not targeted, you're unlikely to be affected. If it is targeted, you're likely fucked either way. My gut feeling is that Chrome has a slight advantage over the rest, including Edge, but this is a gut feeling, and the advantage will be very small - the things above matter MUCH more and I would not let it influence your choice."

That's an extremely dangerous assumption. They're safe from mass malware (because it simply doesn't run) and the semi-targeted crimeware stuff (because they again write their malware once for the standard application and a custom system isn't worth their time).

They're also hard for an outsider to get insight into because they're custom-made, but relying on that is called ""security by obscurity"" and it was proven over and over again that it doesn't work.

In fact, most of the common techniques for hacking would apply to the old systems, except that you get to use the basic textbook variant of the attack instead of some crazy magic to work around the 15 different layers of mitigations introduced by now:

* Something using fixed lengths? Try to make some field longer (How about scheduling the transaction to happen in the year 10000? If they have protection that checks that, how about scheduling it in a different time zone for 9999-12-31T23:59-1100 and hoping it gets translated to their headquarter's local time or UTC?) and use that to fuck with the rest of the data.
* Something using variable lengths? Buffer overflow, truncation attacks, ...
* Something using delimiters? Various injection and delimiter-masking attacks.

Luckily, banks don't rely *just* on the systems being ancient, they also (presumably) isolate them really well so that you can't even communicate with them.

You need to *somehow* make clear what's *your* food, *his* food and *shared* food. Separate shelves are best/easiest (labels can be missed and then you'll clash because you feel like he intentionally ate your food despite the label while he feels like you're freaking out over a mistake, and if you just mention it verbally it's easy to forget).
