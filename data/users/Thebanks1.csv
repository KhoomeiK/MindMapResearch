personalfinance,fedee8m,t1_fedaark,1579009213.0,"It’s a crystal ball question but the best strategic answer is: will you be making more in retirement than now?

Point being is that if you’ll make more in retirement you want the tax break then, on the higher income. And if you make more now, you want the tax break now. 

So ask yourself/her that question. Generally speaking if she is on the first 1/3 or 1/2 of her career trajectory she will want to put as much in a Roth as possible.  Once her income is suspected to have “peaked” (usually the second half of your career) you switch to a traditional. 

Again it’s very rough guidance without knowing specifics."

personalfinance,feca4t4,t1_feai0ot,1578969396.0,"You’re throwing a lot of numbers and percents out there which I am trying to follow.  Here is my best understanding and answer. 

If you do 6% to Roth and 6% to traditional you will NOT receive any extra match. The company match is based on your contributions regardless of Roth or traditional choice.  If your goal is to max out the company match you just want to do 6%. 

Finally you are really diving into the nitty gritty of percentages to Roth and traditional.  I don’t know her age, your income, or where she is in her career but with a 66k salary you would generally be best doing a Roth. 

Again that is a “majority of the population” answer without knowing age, future projected income, your income (not hers), or whether you need the tax break on your paycheck for the extra income."
personalfinance,fec972g,t1_feacgs9,1578968878.0,"Correct there are just two “sub accounts” within your 401k. One will be a Roth with your contributions and one will be traditional with company match. 

The basic info from you 401k balance will just show the grand total but if you dive into a statement you will see it separated. 

Also if you ever change jobs and roll over the 401k you’ll get two checks. One Roth and one traditional."

personalfinance,fe8qw6s,t1_fe8maw0,1578929560.0,"Good choice. 

You’re life expectancy is probably out into your late 80s or even early 90s. You can’t shift a retirement portfolio to a conservative stance at 55 and afford to live off the distributions for 30 years. There just won’t be enough growth to keep up with expenses and inflation."
personalfinance,fe8a917,t1_fe7x7fs,1578924153.0,"Think of the Roth IRA as a bucket. The bucket has special tax benefits for you. 

You can put many different things in the bucket. Stocks. Bonds. Etc. 

The Target Date fund mentioned previously is a blended product containing a diversified mix of stocks, bonds etc so you don’t have to pick them yourself.  From the way you described yourself as not having the time to do the research, a Target Date fund is an excellent choice. 

Although my advice is to pick your target retirement date and then add 5-10 years. IMO the only problem with target date funds is that they shift conservative a little too early."

I once read a great example of how this helped humans spread all over the globe. 

Say you live in your village but it is becoming too crowded. You chose to strike out for fresh lands. 

You pack up your stuff and head out and the journey will take a month. Day one your leg muscles are burning like crazy but every day they grow stronger and stronger allowing you to march longer distances every day with ease. 

When you arrive at your destination you now need shelter. Those giant endurance muscles you have built in your legs are no longer needed for lengthy daily hikes. So those muscles are no longer needed and start to fade. 

However you need to chop down trees to build shelter.  Your lanky arms and shoulders now begin to grow in strength making your new task easier."
