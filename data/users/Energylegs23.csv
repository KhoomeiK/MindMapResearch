Why does someone else have to pay for your house to be put out if it catches fire? Or for the police to find the guy who robbed you?

Plenty of people pay into services they don't use because they know they better society as a whole."
AskReddit,fgn2o9z,t1_fgn1eus,1580936535.0,"I disagree with his rhetoric and he is probably beyond any hope of anyone changing his mind. 

On the other hand, what if there are some more rational people who were starting to see Pres. Trump's flaws, but just got completely turned off because you just called (roughly) 49% of Americans idiots because of one bad choice.

At the beginning of his presidency I wasn't a supporter, but I was right leaning and always took great offense to people calling 175 mil (give or take) people morons because of a bad choice. I firmly believe if it wasn't for these broad stroke insults and disregarding people's opinions because of a single demographic characteristic (in this case political party) that I would have changed my mind on trump and quite a few other issues much sooner.

If we want to close the partisan divide and change minds then we can't go around insulting large groups of people because a handful of super shitty people decided to be super vocal."
unpopularopinion,fgn1eru,t1_fgn0iyp,1580935839.0,"I'm not sure. Like I said, I don't like dealing in absolutes as it's impossible to categorically list every since possible right that women or men may have and then compare. I even ceded to you that likely women are equal to men (in law) in the US, but I don't have nearly all the knowledge to state they absolutely are. 

And as I also said, the USA is not the only country in the world, which was the main point that you seem to have missed completely."

unpopularopinion,fgmvmk4,t1_fgmr5bz,1580932890.0,"Probably because feminism is still the proper term for fighting for women's rights while still believing in gender equality, it's just being very corrupted by the waves of misandrists calling themselves feminists."
