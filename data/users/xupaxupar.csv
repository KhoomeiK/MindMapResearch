September2020bumpers,ff91xi7,t1_ff810aq,1579702816.0,Total crap. Try not to stress until the bill comes and raise hell if you have to.  Fingers crossed you have a place that lets you choose out of pocket.
September2020bumpers,ff91srb,t1_ff8tn5h,1579702717.0,That may be the case for yours. There are countless labs that offer NIPT and they all do it differently. Moreover each OB office does it differently.   Some folks pay the lab directly (which seems to be the less problematic way) and other offices the bill goes through them which seems to be a way of getting a few extra bucks for themselves when they do nothing but receive the results.
September2020bumpers,ff80l4y,t1_ff7zavg,1579662870.0,"I made a big stink of it because I specifically asked my OB of the cost and what I heard her say is $350 with no insurance and insurance may pay some of it or not.  I was keenly listening because my friend who did it elsewhere paid $250, so I was comparing in my head and decided ok $350...which turned out to be $1600 because the insurance had “accepted it”. Like no shit they accepted an expense that they don’t have to pay...the office wouldn’t let me pay it as out of pocket and billing continued to deny my request citing that the doctor (who apparently has ownership in the practice) was the final decider. So I used the online portal to message the doctor directly writing an essay on it.  Finally they agreed to bring down to $350. I was about to go the medical licensing board I was so pissed and it seemed unethical to use this as such a money making opportunity.  I paid it and never set foot in the practice again. The new one I found had midwives and was night and day better."
September2020bumpers,ff7yz5i,t1_ff7pwxx,1579661721.0,"Ugh girl yeS! So sorry! I had similar issues  with first pregnancy.  The NIPT test seems to be a prime example of the bullshit that is medical costs.  Pay out of insurance $250, pay with insurance it’s $3000, insurance say no our max amount we will pay is $1600 but we’re not actually gonna pay any of that so now you owe $1600. If they were losing money the out of pocket price it wouldn’t exist.  So they’re just price gouging when they can like every hospital and medical facility out there .

That said, I am wondering since the entire pregnancy will be within the deductible year if it’s worth going through insurance so long as it goes towards your deductible. For me there’s 100% chance of meeting my $5k deductible. Not sure if worth the risk though.   Whenever you think you understand a medical/insurance thing, you’re wrong and left screwed.  At least that’s been my experience."

prius,fechodj,t3_eodegt,1578974162.0,"Definitely get some quotes, which is just a few quick phone calls since you know the repairs.  Depends how much longer you plan to drive it but the cheapest car is the one you own so it’s not unreasonable at all to do the repair.  Have you had to replace the battery yet? I guess that would make me a bit nervous if I were you, would be crossing my fingers I wouldn’t have to do that in a couple years as well.  Other than that, odds are low that you’d have any other major expenses."

worldnews,fdgh3je,t1_fdfrkrm,1578396515.0,"She’s not talking about the structure of the government, she’s talking about what motivates the few at the top that’s often the same even in a democracy: greed, control, and power.   It’s a reminder that you can’t demonize a whole population as representative of the actions of their government. Especially in the case of Iran where a lot of their population was and still is actually quite secular, until the post-Shaw (which our government played a big role in putting in) regime came in and instituted strict religious rules. I highly recommend reading her book the Persepolis for understanding."

You are American, I am Iranian, we don't know each other, but we talk together and we understand each other perfectly. The difference between you and your government is much bigger than the difference between you and me. And the difference between me and my government is much bigger than the difference between me and you. And our governments are very much the same.""
