These things are hard and can be so discouraging cause there's no real cure. When I had my check ups they said I don't have cists either so that's why they are not sure if it's Endo or not. I have pains but they are not consistent you know. Sometimes it's so bad I get cold sweats and sometimes it's ok. They put me on the pill and said that would give further information, but then I had to move to another country so the whole process was interrupted. Anyway, enough of me whining. Best of luck with your issues!"

Damnthatsinteresting,ffew63x,t1_ffeth0s,1579868061.0,"I'm sorry you have Endo, I'm going to doctors too, but they're not sure if that's what I have or not. I was thinking more about when my mom got a hysterectomy and she has a lot of issues still. Obviously she is older anyway, but it didn't help. She takes some pills but they don't really help her. The medical services here aren't top notch so maybe they have better medicines in better countries, but what I was trying to say is from my experiences there's still no perfect replacements so people shouldn't just go around throwing good uteruses away."
HistoryMemes,ffesqzt,t1_ffeq4cv,1579863762.0,"Yeah, we had it worse and we didn't start another world war did we? We behaved like good little countries. We did join Germany, but that's beyond the point..."
Damnthatsinteresting,fferz13,t1_ffejxw4,1579862649.0,"Well you still kinda do, even if you don't want kids, as it regulates a lot of hormonal activity and all that. You don't want early menopause with the hot flashes and possible early onset osteoporosis. If you are already in menopause then dunno man, chuck it out the window, let's see if things can get worse."

books,fesplmb,t1_feslne6,1579367678.0,"Well it's probably a "" he's a traitor now"" type of sentiment, it might be shared by many, but I can't imagine by all. Maybe it has something to do with the many wo left during the famines and those who stayed developed a mentality where leaving is some great ain. Many people in my country go away to work in other countries but most go back after a time. Those who stayed home think that the leavers become snobbish and think themselves better, even if it's not the case. It's almost like a defense mechanism. Those who left miss the homeland but also hate it for the many reasons that made them leave. You definitely change. You loose your language proficiency if you don't have the chance to use your mother tongue, you adopt a few mentalities and all that, but banning them from being truly Irish or whatever ethnicity is a bit unreasonable in my opinion."
books,fesi626,t1_fesgb73,1579365379.0,"I look at is if say you were to eradicate the population of Europe. Pretty diverse in it's current state, but if you cut it down to a fraction then you'd have something similar to the native situation. People would still call themselves french and German and the Brits would still be appalled to be called a Frenchie and so on. Now in Europe you have subsets of let's say Spanish, like Catalan or whatever, but after a devastating loss of numbers on the whole continent maybe you would leave your Catalan identity behind and just call yourself Spanish, cause others are barely bothering to call you Spanish, they just lump you in as European. Am I making any sense? I struggle with conveying my ideas, I apologise in advance. Anyway that's how I look at it."
books,fesfd3y,t1_fesbz4l,1579364557.0,"It's really only complicated when you start out from the tweets and comments. I should have started with her wiki page and interviews. It's pretty clear there. Anyway the point is, she wasn't really raised in the culture she is writing about and people are upset that there are inaccuracies. It's not that big a deal if let's say you are using Norse mythology cause it's not a living religion/ tradition, not in it's ""original"" form anyway, but since Navajo is a living culture with people's ties to it strengthened almost to obsession because of the history, the accuracy of every detail is deemed important. You can play around and subvert and use artistic license with Norse mythology based books, but it appears it's more complicated when it comes to native mythology and traditions."
books,fesbz4l,t1_fesat16,1579363683.0,"No. Born and raised Ohkay, married into Dine. I searched a bit further and I'm pretty sure I got it right. Shit's still complicated and confusing as fuck . Especially, as you worded it, to an outsider looking in. I spent about an hour on this cause insomnia (yey!) and I'm still not sure, although that could have been just the lack of sleep making me slow."

books,fep3k4r,t1_fep118z,1579311345.0,"I understood it more as she was born Ohkay Owingeh, but wrote about Dineh (Navaho) culture. The two tribes, while both native, are not one and the same, she was merely adopted into the second culture and they feel that the portrayal was inaccurate. It's a bit confusing and please correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what I got out of it. Then again I'm not a native English speaker so take it with a grain of salt."
Fantasy,femgggo,t1_fekqeqx,1579254238.0,"I too, went streight to Amazon after watching the show and was disappointed that there were no pretty collector editions of the books. I'm going to hold off on buying them for a while, in the hopes that the hype will convince publishers that they need to make a nice, fancy box set or something. I've read the first two, well listened to them, a few years back and then kinda got caught up in other things, but now I have new hunger for Witcher books thanks to the show."
