anime,fdj3tl2,t1_fdegr2o,1578457704.0,Holy crap this is amazing and gets my blood pumpin! Not to mention the art style is unique and interesting. More slice of life then I was hoping for but my god it's a good pick. Still have 4 episodes to go thank you for the recommendation!
lfg,fdd3afc,t1_fdd295l,1578293026.0,Yeah I would be down to see if you are a fun addition I messaged you. : )
lfg,fdd0r9x,t1_fdczzxm,1578290269.0,I would prefer it as I have a third possible guy that is interested and am more so just seeking to round out the cast of players I do apologize and hope you understand. : )

cats,fd3iq2b,t1_fcogjy1,1578158702.0,Like in a bin? Or just in a heap of towels? xD
cats,fcoekul,t3_ei2zq8,1577830341.0,When my cat isn't having the best day he hides in a ramen box under a living room chair and goes to sleep. xD
cats,fcodjm1,t3_ei0b0e,1577829608.0,Wish my cats were like that. I have 4 and all of them love the 17 year old male cat but he gets annoyed at all of them. And the rest just dislike each other. If only there was a peace cat treaty I could have them sign.

Also not only that but you can make so many more dishes with eggs and it will make things oh so much yummier. Best of luck! Oh pssst put that good good pepper on the eggs ; )
offmychest,fclk8ih,t3_ehewu6,1577749733.0,This makes me super happy! What a sweet dad. Also heck yeah he can knock someone out with one punch what a sick dad!
