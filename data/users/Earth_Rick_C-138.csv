askmath,fg440ak,t3_ews60h,1580495689.0,"A u-sub of u=x only accomplished something if you like the variable u much more than x. 

I like to call these “sneaky u-subs” because you’re not looking for what usually hints at a u-sub. If you have addition or subtraction of linear terms in an irritating place (denominator, square root, etc.) with another linear term elsewhere where addition or subtraction would be fine, you can effectively switch where the addition/subtraction is happening with the trick the other commenters mentioned. 

x/sqrt(x+1) is a problem but is integrating (x+1)/sqrt(x) straightforward? Since it is, a “sneaky u-sub” setting u equal to the irritating addition in the square root and then solving for x will fix your problem by changing where the addition/subtraction occurs to a place where it’s easy to deal with. Note: you don’t actually end up integrating (x+1)/sqrt(x) because the sign flips with the u-sub but that’s a check for if the technique will work."

Sexuality really has nothing to do with it. “Don’t touch a female friend in a manner you wouldn’t touch a male friend” is good advice no matter your orientation. It’s an issue of women’s bodies being viewed as a public commodity in a way men’s aren’t.

The IQR is the _spread_ of the middle 50% of the data, not the range of values in the middle 50% of the data. People might say it but that doesn’t make it correct. People also use odds and probability interchangeably when they are related but definitely not the same."
statistics,fdf015s,t1_fdezbxk,1578350256.0,"“Of the mean” is implied to some extent by the use of standard deviation since it’s, by definition, based on the mean. It’s not a bad idea to include it just to be precise. 

IQR is not both. IQR is a single number (Q3-Q1). When displayed graphically, it’s displayed as a distance as represented by the distance between the quartiles. IQR is the distance between the two, not all the values contained in the interval. Admittedly, that’s a distinction without a difference visually since both would be represented the same way. Conceptually, they’re very different and only one is correct."
