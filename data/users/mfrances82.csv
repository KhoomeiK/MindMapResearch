dogs,fgcmbi1,t1_fgajmff,1580674060.0,"Please consider NOT feeding grain free food.  It's killing dogs--and in fact, very FEW dogs have an allergy to grain.   Look into a condition called Nutritional DCM (Dilated Cardiomyopathy) that has killed hundreds of dogs and has given even more dog heart disease.  Please. Talk to your vet about it as well.

dogs,ff3f7bt,t3_erdezp,1579539832.0,Embark DNA test is thorough and detailed.  Only a DNA test will give you the information you want.  All the opinions in the world (even here on Reddit) are worth squat without actual DNA.
dogs,fbu2lsy,t3_ee6ljy,1577106178.0,"Mine does the exact same thing!!!!  My 4 year old Great Dane tolerates it, but doesn't seem overly thrilled by it. The puppy (now 1 yr old Dane/Lab mix) still does it--it was something she started doing when she was about 3 months old!!!!  My vet said it was a sign of submission--whatever it is, I think it's cute, too!"
