2. Yes, if you're living paycheck to paycheck and have a very tight budget, an unexpected charge of $25 can be very impactful. Many people don't have expendable income to just throw away $10+ randomly.

3. It's not like that's the only fee that poor people have to pay for being poor. There are other things like not being able to afford bulk purchases which are cheaper, paying for childcare while working multiple jobs, etc. This is just one more thing that adds onto the problem that it is expensive to be poor. There are a lot of fees that pile up."

While you wouldn't put a vanilla 2 mana 3/2 in your deck, there are many situations where you would want that tempo in aggressive matchups. If the alternative is passing the turn against hunter or zoo warlock, I would LOVE to play a 3/2. That's why flexible cards are very strong and people tend to underrate them by saying things like ""Neither of the options are worth 2 mana!"" while ignoring the value given by flexibility itself because it's much harder to quantify."

It feels bad but sometimes it's the only play against aggro, and you can't just hold onto scion hoping that you draw the invoke cards needed to activate it. You need to play *something* to try to stabilize and retain some tempo. Those situations are now substantially worse for the deck.

As you've said, you have to think about how the deck is affected in situations besides the best case scenario. You don't always have the ideal draw, and you don't always have time to setup scion+barista combos. Mana nerfs always have a noticeable impact on the aggro matchup"
