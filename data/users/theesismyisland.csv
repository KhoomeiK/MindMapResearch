I know that he needs a degree of personal space, and part of our preparations will mean choosing a place to live where he can take time by himself when he needs it. Especially settling into a whole new country, I'm sure it will be overwhelming at times. 

All we can do is the best we can, and we're certainly trying."
offmychest,feu0pgz,t1_fetb9vl,1579381986.0,"It took us quite some time to sort through the details. I can't stress enough: communicate. About everything. Never stop talking about your wants and fears. 

The immigration conversation has been ongoing, and we fill in little details here or there as we grow together. He says at least once a week, ""We are a team."" It's that attitude that makes this whole thing what it is for each of us."
offmychest,fetlhqv,t1_fetif33,1579376596.0,"It's possible... for two people who work hard to make their own life apart while still holding each other close in heart. It's such a delicate balance, but once you find your rhythm and have a reasonable plan for closing the distance, *of course* it is possible.

I'm very lucky in that a friend of mine understands what we're going through and has recently emigrated herself to be with her partner. She's an understanding ear and voice of reason when things get hard. Ultimately though, we're adults, we make our own decisions, and we're the ones who have to live with the consequences.

Here's hoping you feel strong and empowered to choose your happiness first, with or without support."
offmychest,fet9u7m,t1_fet4y9k,1579373102.0,That's fantastic. I hope it's a smooth process for you when the time comes.
