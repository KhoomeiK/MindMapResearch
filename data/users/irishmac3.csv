BarbaraWalters4Scale,ffd2otm,t1_ffci6s9,1579812233.0,"His math with the year 1985 is incorrect but his title says people 35 years old. I am 35 and I was born in 1984, and 35 years prior to that is 1949, which is still in the 40’s like he said in the title. 

My birthday is closer to Dec 31, 1949 than it is to today and I am 35"
AskReddit,feoqnda,t1_femyki4,1579304082.0,"Who goes to Seattle for the gum wall though? Hell I doubt very many people even go to Pike Place just for the gum wall.

The “original” Starbucks I think is the most overrated tourist attraction in Seattle. Super long lines for the same coffee you get all over the country and it’s not even where the the first sbucks was. People actually go out of there way to go there for some reason"

todayilearned,fen00pz,t1_femow53,1579273902.0,[it was both.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/07/unabomber-ted-kaczynski-brother-david-kaczynski-every-last-tie-book) She initially read it and thought it sounded like Ted so she asked her husband to read it. He then confirmed it by the phrases his brother had used throughout his life.  I think she deserves some credit for it though.

todayilearned,femyjkp,t1_femvl1h,1579272895.0,"He said he would donate what was left after paying his legal fees. Unfortunately the government taxed it too so he [did end up donating about $500k.](https://www.upi.com/Archives/1999/01/12/UPI-Focus-UNABOMbers-brother-gives-away-reward/6047916117200/) , but there is no indication he kept any of it."
todayilearned,femxigo,t1_femvsiv,1579272177.0,"No “have your cake” means just that, still possessing the cake or keeping it and not eating it. So you can’t save your cake and also eat it as it would be gone.  Another way to say it is you can’t save your money and spend it too.

In other words, you can’t have it both ways."
