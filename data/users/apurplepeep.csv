todayilearned,ffedb2b,t1_ffecd9g,1579843842.0,">but it's quite a separate thing to believe they were totally subhuman before late 20th century.

I know this might be a shock to you because they don't teach this much, but I'm telling you: leading up tho the 60s, there was still clinically accepted doctrine calling into question that women could functionally think on the same level and had the same self-awareness as men. 

There were exceptions, thank fucking god, and people like Bellie did wonders for showing the world women weren't brood mares, but a lot of it was not just the ideology that women were inferior, it was a reluctance to change the laws because, why bother? women should just shut up and cook. it's not healthy for women to be more than that.

some places allowed women to work, but the pay went to their husbands. some places allowed women to teach higher classes, but if they got married or had kids they were fired. Sometimes they were allowed to inherit things- if no male wanted to claim it. Just because some women worked on airplanes in WWI and II, doesn't mean they were regarded as equals. 

Still today, we can't get over the hurdle of the concept of women having say over their own bodies. Laws are still being put in place, right now, where women do not control their own physical bodies- not just being forbidden from abortions, but also from getting birth control, or having operations to prevent pregnancy- they need permission from husbands and so on to do it. Women aren't paid as much as men, and aren't hired or promoted into high-paying jobs, so women inherently get paid less. This is going on RIGHT NOW.

So try your best to really understand that the concept of female equality isn't even a reality yet, and wasn't even bothered with until the late 60s. Yes, it really is that new. It's great that you can't seem to believe it, but for the sake of everyone else- please understand this was the truth. 

There's a great documentary called The Ascent of Woman that goes into exactly how much women contributed to history that was then suppressed, overwritten, or misattributed, why this happened, and how women's rights slid backwards terribly for a few hundred years before the gains we made in this last century. I doubt you'll bother watching it at all because I don't think you actually care about women's rights at all... but it's there for you if you want to."

it only took one guy- your husband or father or something- to tell them you were unmanageable, and they would put you in an insane asylum beside legitimately dangerous mentally ill patients, where everyone around you would consider you insane and gaslight you into thinking it as well. If you tried to fight back or run to save yourself, they would literally give you a lobotomy to pacify you. This was *extremely* common, we're talking ""shameful secret every family has"" types of common. It was a useful way to get rid of any female member of the family that wasn't getting married enough and who therefore was expensive to feed. Or any woman who embarrassed or ""dishonoured"" her father or husband, if she wasn't subservient enough to them, or if they just wanted another woman and needed her taken away. A convent can't take every single woman they wanted to get rid of, so you could just throw them into an asylum forever which had way, way lower standards.

news,ffbcsdv,t1_ffapy8a,1579759934.0,"just to make sure everyone understands:

mormonism was founded during an era of the US where people were inventing their own little religions to allow them to do whatever they wanted because now they were free from europe's crushing religious control scheme. cults were everywhere, everything was a cult. Many of them had a similar thing where they were invented solely for the purpose of making a single guy extremely rich and able to fuck as many women as they wanted, but uh ""cuz god"".

mormonism was one of these. Everything else is added-on lore fanfic shit to make it sound more appealing and legit to outsiders, so they would join the cult and give the church money and fuck as many women as they want and sell their effectively useless daughters to old men and all a guy had to do to get in on it was to join the church. 

the ""lore"" they dreamed up was so contrived, you can't make it up: a dude found the word of god on some golden tablets, but nobody's allowed to see them, because that's a test of faith! They definitely exist though, and uhhhh if you join then once you die you get to become your OWN god.

That's kindof one of the thing that annoys me most about libertarians, that they think they have the perspective and are informed enough to individually decide when regulations go ""too far"", and invariably it ends up poorly because libertarians are often folks who live in a happy zone of privilege where they don't understand how much people rely on things they aren't able to directly affect because the people representing them don't give a damn about them.

yes it is, look at this thread. Look at you. You can't even admit the difference without quantifying it, not because you want justice, but because if you were to admit it wasn't equal, then you'd be admitting I have a point and you cannot accept that.

Your little platitudes mean absolutely nothing. History is riddled with men who, with zero consequence, knock up women and because they suffer nothing, continue with their lives. That's half of history in and of itself. Your ""I wouldn't because it's wrong!"" means literally nothing at all.

Yes, when I enter threads like this and see men unable to understand or grasp the concept of exactly what women- unfairly- have to suffer from men, they can't even admit it because it'd make them look bad, yes of course I believe a large amount of men are like you. I have this argument every single time this thread comes up. You actually believe women would do this to themselves? 

admit the inequality exists and it is in your favour and I'll *start* to be able to take you seriously. I have met so few men in my life unable to even admit that women are at a disadvantage *in society at all*, how the fuck do we improve things or gain any foothold when the people with the ability to take away that freedom cannot even admit there's a problem to begin with?

anyone who speaks against trump already puts themselves at risk. If he continues emparting how lax he is on those who are inspired by his rhetoric to kill or violently assault or abuse others realize he has retained power and had zero repercussions for everything he's done, doubtless their boldness will simply increase just like it has the last 3 years, people have *already* died because of it, and people are currently in internment camps because of it.

I see more unfettered violence against people he stocastically declares his enemies, and people who his fans hate: progressives, liberals, women, LGBT+ people, muslims or other immigrants, black people, etc. The violence these people incur is so far beyond what they would otherwise and terrorism with these far-right ideologies has shot up and I don't see much being done to curb it.

Like the last time this happened, he'll voice his hatred of anyone who speaks out against him, those people will be endangered- they already have, in congress, ie Rashida Tlaib, AOC and Pelosi, who have dealt with death threats for the last YEAR. 

But on the more individual level, it willbe harder to speak out against him without fearing violence for one simple reason: the ramifications for it just won't be there anymore. It's nearly insurmountable right now, and when it all but dries up, who is going to enforce these laws? the police that beat down ""antifa"", who cook up lies and get away with them in the news, who frame innocent people, who throw out rape kits, who make jokes about immigrants and invent new slurs for them we find out from their facebook groups?

and then, like the last time, when it happens more often than it already does, and there's no hope for ramifications, like last time, they'll start oppressing these people with the threat of unmitigated and unregulated violence that the police won't care to stop, on BEHALF of his fanboys- the only people he fucking cares about. But I fear trump fanboys more than any sort of terrorists from abroad or nuclear missiles, I cross the street when I see them coming, I don't engage, because right now? they all know that what they do won't really earn them any punishment they won't view as some kind of martyrdom.

do you get it?"
