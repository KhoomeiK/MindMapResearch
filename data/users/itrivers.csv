WinStupidPrizes,fczrsli,t1_fczhnk7,1578107528.0,"Look it’s all well and good to say things like speed traps are to catch people speeding so it’s your own fault and you merge onto the highway at the speed limit without going over and somehow managing to merge in without problems. And I absolutely agree, driving can be fucking terrifying at times, but to me the most danger comes from people being so unpredictable and inconsistent. And in my experience at least a good portion of unpredictable and dangerous driving is caused by people trying to follow the letter of the law rather than the spirit of it (like when people slam on the brakes at a speed reduction rather than slowing down gradually before the sign, letter followed but dangerous). I honestly don’t have a problem at all with our road laws, I do have a problem with how they are enforced. 

Even you agree that 2km an hour is within margin of error, so I received a ticket for potentially 1km over while performing a task that requires you to match traffic speed, shoulder check, accelerate or brake to match up to gap you’re about to move into and be aware of the movements of everyone around you. No matter how you want to swing it there’s no way you can argue that adding glancing down at your speed and taking your eyes off the road for even a second in that situation is a good idea. And more so that speed limit takes priority over a safe merge (lets be real if everyone on the highway is going 102 and you’re refusing to go over 100 then your gap is moving relative to you, and unless you’re incredibly lucky, you aren’t going to get in without someone letting you in, which they are not obligated to do. The safest thing to do is speed at 102 merge then slow back to 100 once you’re in.) 


I’ve had so many near misses where I’m stuck behind someone trying merge well below the limit. And while that person will never get a ticket for it, they are an absolute hazard and are likely to cause an accident. There was one a couple of weeks ago where a tradie tried to push onto the highway without matching speed and he ended up next to a b-double and he just started to merge over expecting the truck to move over and let him in, but there was a car on the other side so he couldn’t. Tradie wrecked his Ute and put the b-double in the ditch. But hey at least he wasn’t speeding right. 


Also if you think the person rear ending someone who flew into their stopping distance is at fault you’re having a laugh. I had a coworker in that situation and their insurance absolutely railed the person merging in. iirc they said something about not being established in the lane, therefore rear ender is not at fault. You seem to have taken what I said to mean someone merges in and the person behind just keeps chugging along and smashes them. Not so, person merges into second cars stopping distance then brakes heavily to create their own stopping distance. It happens to me so frequently that I just move over if I can and if I can’t I give heaps of room to entering traffic, but that’s not the law so not everyone does that."
WinStupidPrizes,fczgr23,t1_fcze2qk,1578100894.0,"Nah you’ve drunk the every k over is a killa kool-aid mate. 

I got a fine for going 3km over 60. The camera was pointed at the bottom of a downhill on-ramp to a main road. The absolute very last thing you should have to be worried about when using an on-ramp is what speed you’re going. As you do not have right of way entering the roadway you have to speed match traffic in order to position yourself and slip in safely, something you can only do by ignoring your dash and paying attention to all the road users around you. Setting up a camera there was plain revenue raising, with nothing to do with safety. If I had been doing “the right thing” according to you not only would I have been making a hazard out of myself I’d be endangering the person behind me also. 


I bet you’re the type of dumbass the tries to merge onto the highway at 85 because you don’t think you should have to floor it to speed match and that everyone should give way to you entering because it’s the right thing to do and if you get in the lane and they rear end you well it’s their own fault for being shit drivers."
