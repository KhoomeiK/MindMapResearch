EatingDisorders,ffar3lw,t3_esky06,1579742521.0,"This could be reactive eating, a response of your body (who recognizes that you are starving it again and is trying to put on the brakes as a survival mechanism) trying to keep itself at your ideal weight. Happened to me in my last relapse. I was always the type of anorexic that just...wouldn't eat, but this time it was like my body had enough and my anorexia was overriden by the need to survive. So I lost weight, didn't eat, and then was all of a sudden binging for a day or two, then not eating again. It's a horrible, horrible cycle, but it happens to SO many people in recovery. I fought it so hard, until I realized I shouldn't. I let myself eat even up to 10k calories a day, I gained weight, gained 5 lbs over my usual weight, which eventually tapered back off over the course of a year of normal eating. I thought it would never end and I would balloon up to 800 lbs but that didn't happen, and it won't happen. Listen to your body."

dogs,fehc07z,t3_ep51hq,1579113443.0,"I had the EXACT same experience. We had to put down my 14 year old dog that was my childhood pet, then my boyfriend pressed for another puppy right away. We ended up getting a new one after only 2 weeks. He bonded with her immediately, and I, like you, was still grieving and honestly resented her. Not for the dog she is, but for not being my previous dog (if that makes sense). I had a few meltdowns, sobbing, feeling guilty, the whole nine yards. We almost gave her back to the rescue at one point cause I couldn't look at her without missing my old dog. But I stuck through. My boyfriend did have to shoulder some of the care, unevenly, until I was ready to step up. We got her at 4 months old and she is now 9 months. I still call her my boyfriends dog, but I have been heavily involved in her training which has helped us bond. We share responsibilities pretty evenly now too. I wouldn't say I'm 100% there yet but it's improved tremendously. I can now see her as a separate dog from my other one. Don't give up. It will get better :)"
dogs,fehbb40,t3_ep5jpm,1579113026.0,"I was in almost the exact same position earlier in 2019, right down to the dog not walking very well and sleeping in unusual spots. It was really, really, hard to hold fast to the appointment instead of putting it off, because Tasha was still in there, she still loved her food and her treats and she wagged her tail when she saw me. But I'm glad we did it when we did, she passed SO peacefully, surrounded by everyone who loved her, in her favourite spot in our yard. The vet told us that she was ready to go since it took less than half the dose before she stopped breathing. If we waited any longer, she may have passed in her sleep, alone, or in pain. You are doing the right thing, your pup is ready. As my vet had to tell me, better a day too early than a day too late."
dataisbeautiful,feh990x,t1_feh7pu8,1579111787.0,"Nah if you actually looked into it, you would see that the quote was taken out of context. It went like:  
Martin Bashir:When you are talking about children we met Gavin - and it was a great privilege to meet Gavin because he's had a lot of suffering in his life - when Gavin was there he talked about the fact that he shares your bedroom?  
MJ: Yes.  
Bashir: Can you understand why people would worry about that?  
MJ: Because they are ignorant.  
Bashir: But is it really appropriate for a 44 year old man to share a bedroom **(key word here is BEDROOM not BED)** with a child that is not related to him at all?  
MJ: Why should that be worrying, what's the criminal...who's Jack the Ripper in the room? There's some guy trying to heal a healing child...I'm in a sleeping bag on the floor. I gave him the bed because he had a brother named Star, so him and Star took the bed and I went along on the sleeping bag.  
Bashir: Did you ever sleep in the bed with them?  
MJ: No, but I have slept in a bed with many children. I slept in a bed with all of them when Macauley Culkin was little: Kieran Culkin would sleep on this side, Mac on this side, his sisters in there....we would all just jam in the bed, you know.  
Plus Macauley Culkin has constantly been interviewed and he's maintained that MJ's bedroom was 2000 sq ft. He would have entire families in there. He was a child at heart. His family grew up with 9 kids all jammed into bed.

MichaelJackson,fdqk0xp,t1_fdnrsoh,1578668543.0,"To add to this - I would also recommend reading biographies about Michael's life. I was the exact same way when LN came out, didn't know what to believe because I grew up listening to his music although I didn't know much about him. After LN I read a bunch of books on Michael, and his own autobiography (Moonwalk). The two that have stood out to me were - 'Michael Jackson: The Magic and The Madness' by J Randy Taraborrelli, and ' Untouchable: The Strange Life and Tragic Death of Michael Jackson' by Randall Sullivan. They were a good basis to start understanding Michael's life and why he was the way that he was. Reading those made me realize how fucked up his childhood was, and it contributed to his child-like qualities in adulthood. They also made me see how insane the first accusations in 1993 and 2005 were, like absolute bullshit, and how the media blew everything out of proportion and spread lies. Doing that kind of background reading helped me look at LN in a new light."

They are my favourite songs for that reason too! Plus 'Will You Be There' is just a beautifully made song, and whenever he sings it live you could see how much he loved it."
MichaelJackson,fcvfn25,t3_ej4kw9,1578001090.0,So excited for this!!!!
MichaelJackson,fcvfkr3,t3_ej257h,1578001052.0,"My favourite song is 'Will You Be There' (although closely followed by 'Man In The Mirror', 'Do You Know Where Your Children Are', and 'They Don't Care About Us') and it's hard to choose a favourite album, I love aspects of all of them. I have always been a casual fan of MJ, but the obsession with him kicked in shortly after Leaving Neverland came out, and I decided to read as much as I could about him / his life story and ended up watching multiple live concerts. The rest is HIStory as they say!"
Edmonton,fcsth7v,t1_fcsnctm,1577924685.0,"For humans it's a long time, but for the earth, no that is a very short time. Definitely significant to have that much warming in less than a century."
starbucks,fcnk5ec,t1_fcngsk6,1577813175.0,"I have a Breville too and live in a hard water place. I have had mine for two years with no issue. Just make sure to replace the water filter in the machine every 2 months, and I do a vinegar clean through the whole system every 6 months (ish). Seems to work great so far!"
MichaelJackson,fcnb6lo,t3_ehzyej,1577807861.0,Hopefully this will give Square One a little more traction publicity-wise.
MichaelJackson,fcnb439,t3_ei2vl5,1577807815.0,There's a part of me that hopes he is still alive and is seeing this and realizing how much people love him.
MichaelJackson,fcnb045,t3_ehzjwp,1577807740.0,This is amazing :) LN shot themselves in the foot.
Dogtraining,fcln797,t1_fch9a0g,1577751745.0,"My dog is almost identical to yours but her DNA results were - 25% golden retriever, 25 % McNab, and 12.5% of each of Rottweiler, German Shepherd, Lab, and scenting hound. Crazy how much the GSD genetics pull through with the brindle colouring on the legs."
MichaelJackson,fclk31e,t3_ehtohr,1577749632.0,Oof the accuracy of this. Albeit the best rabbit hole to go down.
dogs,fcl8clf,t1_fcl0wpa,1577742006.0,"Ahhh yeah so is my puppy (although mixed with many other things) but she's a quarter McNab. She also likes to bark at people/dogs when she isn't allowed to say hi to them or they are across the street. I was worried she's reactive but it doesn't seem based in fear or anxiety, just that she really wants to say hi lol. Hoping it's just a puppy thing and she will grow out of it.
Yeah my pup treats rabbit poop like they are little chocolate chips, drives me crazy lmao."
dogs,fcl0jiy,t1_fcknqyf,1577737176.0,What kind of issues are you having with your puppy? I have an 8 month old and it's hard to distinguish between normal puppy behaviours and worrisome behaviours sometimes.
MichaelJackson,fci44zd,t1_fci348i,1577657557.0,Sad how many songs of his we will never hear due to shit like that. I've heard there's something like 200 unreleased tracks.
MichaelJackson,fci3y2o,t1_fc98xkx,1577657485.0,"I love how many documentaries/podcasts/videos have popped up since LN that are defending MJ. Taj said his uncle held the song 'Will You Be There' close to his heart, and I think MJ's fans have proven that they will be there. It's amazing."
