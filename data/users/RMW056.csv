DaybreakNetflix,ffd7zxl,t3_es65j7,1579815198.0,"To be honest the ending kinda made me mad. It felt really out of character for Sam Dean to just up and dump Josh like that and while I get that they had previously fought and Josh’s ideas going forward were a bit childish, it still felt off. Plus, Sam’s whole speech about not needed to be saved and being a leader felt kinda stupid since not even 20 minutes ago she was perfectly fine with Josh being the leader and everyone was looking to him for a plan. And Josh is the one who ends up killing Burr, all Sam did was stall him until he got there. Idk, the ending just felt like Eli’s death to me, it kinda came out of nowhere and felt sort of rushed like the writers needed a twist for the sake of having a twist"

The user of this can quirk can detonate and explode parts of their own body! When it happens, the body part in question completely crystallizes, and if all the pieces are within a certain radius they’ll reform and turn back to normal again. Explosions from the hand seems to do more damage for some reason."
