meirl,fdpk9z3,t1_fdp0gzu,1578630947.0,"I agree with you but this also speaks to the effectiveness of campaigns to guilt people into making choices. You almost always provoke a disproportionate reaction that takes the behavior you’re trying to change to its extremes. People make changes when they believe it’s their choice/out of personal conviction. Not saying it’s right, but that’s the way it is and if we want to make real change that should be the focus."
