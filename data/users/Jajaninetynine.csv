conspiracy,fglwhe3,t1_ffrpxz7,1580912619.0,"As someone who works in this type of industry - not only are there no international standards, it's really fucking difficult to get normal scientists to comply with basic ""don't release GMOs"" protocols. In the medical field, everyone is so accustomed to people not understanding anything about their field that they do whatever they want and think they can talk their way out of getting into trouble. There's no framework to get authorities in when things are going wrong, for example if someone is injured on a construction site, we have an organisation called 'worksafe' who do an audit, and everyone knows who to call etc. But in the medical research industry, the information is limited, many lab heads seem to not know what to do, they don't follow up on anything. I've been in workplaces where there have been meetings ""we're getting audited so we're backdating this paperwork, sign here"" . I fucking hated working in that type of environment. So many staff members were smartarses ""why can't I just pour this sudden the sink haha"" , there were limited controls in place - eg genetically modified cell waste - what do you do when the vat is full? My recommendation is to have the information on the vat, but ""people should just remember"" - when there's 9 different waste systems and hundreds of chemicals, no one thus far has been able to accurately remember them all. No one has been able to remember when they should 'better leave that to the expert to empty' vs 'better add a certain chemical then pour it out' . Especially when each lab uses a different decon chemical for GMO waste and mixing them can be hazardous. But a label stating ""when full, contact xxxxxxx"" hurts people's feelings, and so is not allowed. However the old lady research assistant who handwrites ""DO NOT LEAVE THIS FULL!!! A NEW CAMERA IS EXPENSIVE"" is praised for trying, even though her weird angry post-it-note is the opposite of helpful and the camera is nowhere near the waste vat and not connected at all (seriously, almost every lab has a strange old lady that makes no sense. Lifelong chemical exposure?).  GMO foods engineered to be safe is safe, but that's not what we were researching. So many scientists are proud of their disorganised sloppyness, arrogantly proud that they don't even wearing lab coats in high level labs. If this virus were accidentally released, I'm not surprised at all."

I also find it horrible when some refugees who are doing well complain and complain and then make racist remarks about other people. For example, a person I worked with was a refugee from Asia as a Child. This person would loudly say things like ""white Aussies are violent, they are all convicts"" etc. It's such a bad look to complain about racism against anyone who seems white, which makes the situation difficult. Many other people who are also refugees are lovely people, however they don't loudly state that they are refugees and then loudly say horrible things, so the only b opinion that is heard loudly is often not a nice one. Perhaps we need to stop the media from putting fuel on the fire, and perhaps we need better councelling services for refugees. I don't know what else we can do."

AskReddit,fgabryf,t1_fg8swr4,1580649351.0,"I'm Aussie. I freaked out seeing an American toilet, there is so much water, I was worried it would overflow or something. I didn't freak out too much because I've seen American toilets in teen-comedy movies where the bully flushes a kids head in a toilet. I wonder about in the past before Amercian toilet comedy was a large export - did tourists panic upon seeing the toilets so full of water?"

I'm in the same town as OP, there's minimal racism here, it's super multicultural. Yes come visit, it's a big country, lots to see, still a lot of forests that didn't burn."
