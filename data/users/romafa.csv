The closest I’ve ever heard was him saying he doesn’t think it’s a good idea to give kids hormone treatments when they identify as the opposite gender, that they should wait until they’re fully grown, which seems pretty common sensical to me but gave his guest some pause."
AskMen,ffhwb88,t1_fffytt7,1579956811.0,I’ve said this other places: the show peaked for me when they first got to Alexandria. I loved the idea of a road weary group coming in to this community that was relatively untouched by the outbreak and they just can’t cope. We saw them play with Rick becoming a bad guy when he fought Pete and waved his gun around. I would have loved for them to kick Rick out and force his own people to choose between the safe place or loyalty. I liked the idea of watching Rick become a bad guy (at least in the eyes of the naive alexandrians). But they were never going to have the guts to make the hero of the show seem unlikable.
Futurology,ffgq9v1,t3_eteahl,1579912316.0,"When traffic is heavy on the highway I make it my goal to never touch my brakes like 99% of other drivers around me. It requires leaving a big gap between my car and the car in front of me so that I can coast instead of braking. I’m not sure if it helps improve traffic, especially if I’m the only one doing it and the person behind me is needlessly losing their mind, but it does make it much less stressful than having to slam on my brakes every 100ft. Only downside is that some idiots will jump in front of me when they see the gap thinking our lane is going faster."

He’s also not gaining any undecided voters or swing voters. There is no large section of the population saying “I voted for Hillary but, you know what, Trump has really won me over”.


He’s not losing much support; but, contrary to what Fox News would have us believe, the impeachment has not gained him any support either. He has a historically consistent support base and his approval rating has never been higher than 45%.

entertainment,fend9ln,t3_eovdxm,1579282211.0,"I’m on the fence about this one. On the one hand I agree that when art gets to the point of being judged, as it was by King, then color of skin shouldn’t matter. The work alone should be judged. 


But I don’t agree that movies are pure art. It’s too big a business, with too many hands in the pot. And I think his comments kind of miss the mark on what people calling for more diversity are saying. They aren’t asking for their work to be judged based in their skin at awards ceremony time (awards ceremonies are just where it’s most obvious that the business isn’t diverse enough). They’re asking for more opportunities to be involved in the entire movie-making process. Writers, directors, actors. They’re asking for studios to take risks on up-and-coming POC rather than the aging white guys already heavily involved in the business. They’re asking for characters written for POC to not be filled by white actors because it’s the safest bet. 

I also don’t understand his point that diversity didn’t come up in the 3 categories he’s allowed to vote on as a writer. Diversity absolutely matters at the level of screenwriters and the likes. But if it only gets talked about at the time of judging, then it’s too late."

I tend to not even ask, but I wish sometimes I was more like a person who has no problems asking. 


I personally don’t see anything wrong with the step-daughter asking, especially since it seems like what to do with the money is a family discussion topic (otherwise how else does she even know about it), but she better shut her mouth after the first no.

And I do like the idea of Cobb being the one who was actually stuck in a dream while Mal ascended back to reality. 

But the only way the film has any emotional payoff (for me) is if we follow Cobb on his journey and watch him forgive himself for Mal’s death. There is a catharsis that we lose if we believe that Cobb is still dreaming."
