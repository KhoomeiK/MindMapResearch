IdiotsInCars,fdwlpm8,t1_fdsgww3,1578759962.0,It's been my experience that when someone points out spelling they have lost the argument. Know nothing about... that's your opinion. I can pull a tandem axle trailer at 5100lbs with my 4wheeler. Does that mean I should just because the engine will pull it ? No. One strong gust of wind and that boat will whip that car all over the road.
NissanTitan,fdwk6wi,t1_fdux0lu,1578759546.0,"You mean that annoying whining small cars have? that's at high rpm and not shifting. What you are talking about I have never seen happen. I have heard the argument, but that is all. Just a argument. Ask any farmer or rancher"
IdiotsInCars,fdsgift,t1_fdsb7bf,1578702276.0,How many gallons of gas is in the tank? Witch is at the back along with the motor. Yes decided how the trailer is balanced. From the number of ply on the tire's to filling the gas tank up and any extra crap you think you may need. I'm not even going to try and explain wind and drag to you....

I have seen both sides and the middle do/say/post/brag (to a point) about this.its your opinion which you're entitled to the making comments like that shows how little you know especially when you put a unrealistic percentage in there
woodworking,fda17mb,t3_ek1gq8,1578240504.0,You should add a water dropper for true novelist. If some don't know...a well age dark smoked whiskey (not crown makers extra) will separate with a drop of water. The 1st taste will be of the oils that surface. The next is of the blend. It's night and day difference
woodworking,fda03bi,t3_ek3et0,1578240138.0,Looks good. I know epoxy is popular now days. Just hate knowing that s the last shape it will take of that size. If anything ever again.i know it takes longer wax is hands down the best.

I was getting bagged on hand planning the wet sanding to 25k with wax.(couch runner) I was in the sanding phase and the guys said...I'll start one (same size) now and finish before you. Okay have at, he did and did finish like 2days before me. But, when you put them side by side. Well, I fetched 1500$ more than him."

therewasanattempt,fd84ute,t1_fd80xzp,1578213928.0,Texas is a right to work state. In high school I was working with an electrician small company. morning talk was about a union in the sense of how they operate. Bossman wasn't there yet but he somehow overheard it on the secretaries phone when she called in.he told the secretary to tell all of us to go out to the back portion of the office. He wrote in sharpie closed on the front door locked it and left. We open the next day no more talk of Union

tippytaps,fd1a9ih,t1_fd0e60p,1578129097.0,Whiskers do have to do with a dog's balance. I know this 1st hand. My kindergarten teacher told the class to practice cutting with scissors at home. So I did exactly what she said and cut my dogs whiskers. The dog walks like he was drunk for three months. (Or so I was 5)

Canyou hear photosynthesis?

Part 2 of groot joke

As we have found out, trees like all organisms follow the rhythm of day and night. However, groot makes hammocks and grows flowers extra. Along with, watch over the ones he loves/likes. To me implying that he doesn't sleep.

Doesn't sound as funny"
