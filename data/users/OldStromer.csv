MechanicAdvice,ffh7j80,t3_etlkf7,1579925321.0,It's going to depend way more on the quality of maintenance and lack of long periods of non use than the mileage.
MadeMeSmile,ffgsz56,t3_etfjhs,1579914275.0,I think it's a great place to post your selfie! It made me smile a half hour ago and now it's making me smile all over again. You have a very nice smile.

In all fairness you might well have been ""the right kind of person"" if you had the emotional and financial support of a loving husband or partner.

Best of luck to you."

somethingimade,ff6qjsz,t3_eruayg,1579632795.0,Cute. The hat and your quirky smile.
Shitty_Car_Mods,ff334zx,t1_ff2dn1d,1579532457.0,I think that typically due to aerodynamic forces at high speed the rear of the car gets more lift than the front. The wedge shape of the front already gives it some level of downward force.
interestingasfuck,ff27mma,t3_er4fc0,1579496139.0,Awesome time lapse. My wife grew up in Lake Tahoe. Some winters they had to tunnel out of their house.
Shitty_Car_Mods,ff05yk9,t3_eqxgdk,1579465562.0,I thought the rear of the car is what usually needs the added down force.

aviation,feovupd,t3_eq1ce1,1579306517.0,Truly one of the great planes.
aviation,fel8x2r,t3_eplwm6,1579216624.0,Just BARELY enough airplane to contain that giant engine.

aviation,fehefvt,t1_fehcfjc,1579114851.0,I think the A6 were from Whidbey island on their way back from the range near Yakama. Ya gotta burn up that extra fuel somehow! I don't know where the A10 were from.
aviation,feh4dvo,t3_eotj7a,1579108902.0,I remember the development of this plane. It was a huge loss to Boeing when they lost the competition. What an awesome BEAST.
aviation,feh3i9w,t1_fefz7az,1579108384.0,Great story. Thanks for sharing.
aviation,feh1hgc,t1_fefocyj,1579107171.0,"That would have been AWESOME!
We used to get buzzed by the EA6B or A10 while  camping. I half expected to see pine cones rattling off the trees they were so low. I waited for it every year."
aviation,feezndb,t1_feey9j5,1579044751.0,Nice! I would be so mad at myself for not going outside to get a look.

You were treading a thin line and the two of you did it well.
You were able to honor both families and the baby's mother gets to choose, NOT your mother. The other members of your family need to get behind you.
Good luck."
aviation,feevvbw,t1_feenlsb,1579042331.0,I wonder if the loud plane you heard was something accompanying the C-17. Since it has Turbo Fan engines even a much smaller plane with older style engines with less or no bypass  could be louder.

It took very little of your letter for me to decide NTA. It is YOUR day and YOUR choice. Your Uncle has earned this honor and he has showed you that he appreciates being asked. Actions have consequences and your Mother's new husband has proved with actions that he is not worthy of the respect.

MechanicAdvice,fd5gmna,t1_fd52i98,1578177409.0,"Yes, this is correct. Watch for any swelling over time which could indicate delamination but other than that if it holds air and NO cord is visible run it.

Edit, After zooming in on a better screen you should inspect the bottom of the deepest area of damage very well."

Your children are at an extremely impressionable age. Their proper upbringing is absolutely your primary mission. The last thing they need is an adult that has so far made a lifetime of poor decisions. I cannot imagine your parents trying to pressure you into this. WTF!"

MechanicAdvice,fc9r16x,t3_egrye4,1577556907.0,The RKO Number indicates it's from a Midget or Spitfire. It's displacement will be quite small. Good luck. We loved our 1963 B.
MechanicAdvice,fc3f8l7,t3_efyr93,1577388490.0,I agree. You tube is awesome. Make sure to watch at least three UTubes as you will inevitably run into some descripancies between them and this will help you to get a truer idea of what you are up against.
