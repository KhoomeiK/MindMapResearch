So that means I only smoke on a Friday evening and Saturday starting late afternoon. This works really well for me as I can’t seem to smoke enough to see negative side effects and it means I’ll never show up at work with a stone over. Everyone’s different though, that’s just what works for me."

Petioles,femnz8d,t1_femlwk7,1579264216.0,Vaping is definitely unhealthy but still a way better option than smoking. Inhaling hot particles and gases will be bad for u whether it's smoke or vapour but it's good to reduce the risk as much as possible.
Petioles,femnpfi,t3_epv1b0,1579263937.0,"The problem with smoking daily for me is that I quickly start to lose motivation and become lazier. A couple of months in it will make me feel a little more anxious and tired and it gradually gets worse. Then after a year or so I start to lose mental clarity and my short term memory gets a lot worse even at times when I'm sober. Sometimes I wonder if all that happens because smoking is depleting neurotransmitters faster than my brain can build them back up so it creates a deficit.

Worst of all I never really realised what was happening intil I had been sober for a few months. Anyway, that's my personal reasoning for keeping it down to just the weekends. Because that way I don't get any negative side effects from  being high and I still get to enjoy it."

Petioles,fe8zk4s,t1_fe8oee7,1578932596.0,What worked for me was to stay away from it completely for a few months until I no longer felt any strong attraction to it and then I was able to start smoking responsibly at the weekends. That was after 2 years of smoking daily so I probably had it easier than most.

DrugNerds,fd4t6pr,t1_fd4evlz,1578170855.0,I think it's very addictive. Escapism is a big reason for drug addiction and ketamine is such a strong dissociative that it makes it easy to hide from your problems with it. It also affects a lot of different neurotransmitters.

Petioles,fcn2wse,t3_ehkdeo,1577801768.0,My situation was similar. What worked for me was to quit completely for a few months so that when I started again I could just smoke once or twice a week and be in control. Keep in mind that although it might be harder to fall asleep your quality of sleep will be so much better. It can make a huge difference to how u feel in the long run.

ABoringDystopia,fcin5x1,t1_fcimuse,1577665370.0,Because we can trade it for other things that we need. If something is traded often it becomes currency. I would argue that quality of life is much worse without it.
ABoringDystopia,fcidgk4,t1_fch2o1r,1577660910.0,"Why? Currency allows us to have so much more, we would all be too busy finding food for ourselves and other essentials to ever be able to work towards finer things if we didn't have it. I think its a good thing. Obviously wealth inequality is a problem but I don't think that's the fault of money, its more the fault of people being heartless in my opinion."
AskReddit,fcic98p,t3_eh8gs2,1577660423.0,"So I smoked heavily for a couple of years and more recently have been smoking in moderation (once or twice a week). I don't really experience any unpleasant side effects from smoking moderately except sometimes feeling a bit groggy and slow the next morning but not always.

Smoking heavily on the other hand made me very lazy and unmotivated. It's also very expensive. As far as my mental health is concerned I often felt very unfocused and it could sometimes cause pretty bad anxiety, my memory went to shit but has since mostly recovered.

Don't let anyone tell you it's not addictive. They are either an addict in denial, lying or haven't smoked enough for long enough to figure it out yet. Despite never experiencing withdrawal myself I definitely had a strong psychological dependence after 2 years of smoking daily. I have never heard of anyone smoking daily for a long time without that happening and I know a lot of stoners.

Smoke responsibly people, know your dose and do not smoke every day to get the most out of cannabis without getting harmed."

StonerEngineering,fcg3as3,t3_eh3wsy,1577636115.0,You answered your own question. It biodegrades quickly. Can't have packaging biodegrading while the products still on the shelf. I'm sure there are some applications where it's useful but it can't just replace all plastics.
Petioles,fcfwwfg,t3_eh6ooh,1577634473.0,I Love shrooms as a recreational drug. They're not dangerous in the way that hard drugs are but psychedelics are still risky in a different way so make sure u do ur research and know the relevant harm reduction advice before you try anything. One thing i dont see mentioned enough is to make sure you have acess to some accurate scales so u can be sure what dose you are taking.
