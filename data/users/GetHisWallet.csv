So the US has an amendment that the government shall make no law against freedom of expression, which means the government cannot arrest you for your opinion at all.

Then you post Article 10, which says the UK government not only *can* make laws against freedom of speech, it can do so at any time as it deems fit and restrict you from anything they don't feel you should be allowed to say under a variety of possible conditions.

So, again to clarify because your ""hmm we do"" is a bit vague:  What were you proving here?"

Now I don't even recall how long it's been but he had a mere few days to think this plan was going well and every single morning since then he has to just wake up and live this mess he made.

Also, with this upcoming turn of events, I'm hoping there's going to be some denouncement.  People involved that know their name is going to come up in this material hopefully will pull the trigger on Juicy to save their own ass.  That's the best outcome really, because it will do more to prevent future bullshit if the world sees the entire group crumble under pressure.  Future con artists will realize that they can't trust anyone to keep quiet, and future potential helpers will reconsider when they see that they cannot keep their distance if the plan fails."
PublicFreakout,fdlnnnd,t1_fdlmaem,1578528141.0,">the 1st amendment protects you from talking in non public property so long as you can be limited in your opinion by those who control the property

Sorta correct.

>(being the government)

Incorrect.

> in which case talking there is limited until they deem you a hassle. 

Sorta correct but you're blowing the context on purpose to get to the real jab you wanted to deliver at the end.

>It enables bigots 

Sorta correct.  Same limitations listed before.

>whereas can be used to limit speech that may lead to the much demanded constitutional reform. 

Again, same normal limitations.

>we can talk more openly and meaningfully to change than you guys

Incorrect.

>We can at least speak openly and be meaningful in local councils and parliament.

Same here.

>This lady? She speaks against your government and your ""free speach"" lets her be dragged off.

You seem to think she was at a government session.  She was not.

>I didn't know you mericans needed a speech license

More like a petition to assemble or protest, but yes.

>as talking is free for all over here

Incorrect."
PublicFreakout,fdlfntq,t1_fdlc223,1578523003.0,"Essentially you have the right an opinion without being arrested by the government, but you do not have the right to force people to listen to it or provide you access to all means of expressing it.  A store owner can kick you out of his shop for disagreeing with your opinion.  You can be asked to leave a party.  You can be removed for violating forum protocol, etc.  You can be denied air time on network television even if you state your reason is to express your freedom of speech.  You have to come with paperwork and permissions to really stand your ground.  However, you *can* get those."
