dogs,fedqvbf,t1_fedqojp,1579017931.0,Yes! She’s my first lab and so the thing that amazed me is that she learned how to fetch on her own and bring it back to me! I was shook for some reason. I mean I know it’s in her name “Labrador Retriever” but I didn’t think she would actually do that. They are AWESOME dogs.
dogs,fedqa1t,t3_eomrod,1579017558.0,Sooo true! Especially on Christmas when people will randomly give people puppies. DOGS ARE NOT GIFTS. You have to go to the shelter and see if you feel a connection and research the breed. Btw I agree on the lab part. I have one and she was a biter as a puppy! We got her a lot of chew toys and would put very little peanut butter on it and she would chew them. That helped a lot lol. She stopped when she was about 9 months.
AmItheAsshole,fedoi61,t3_eomte9,1579016445.0,"YTA girl what the fuck, leave him alone and block him. He’s in a relationship. It doesn’t matter if you grew up with him. You clearly can’t communicate with each other without stirring up old feelings, and to answer your question, it seems to me that you are definitely flirting more. LEAVE HIM ALONE"

Your poor mom, I feel bad for her. You say you don’t work and live with her. The least you could do is clean up after your mess.. As the other person said, you do seem annoying."

Everyone has their preferences and you having a different one shouldn’t make you stop listening to music in the shower. 
However, from experience I hate it lmao. My sister is the same way... she listens to creepy, screaming music, and Billie Eilish. Imagine hearing that at 12:00 am? My room is also right next to the shower. 
I just plug in my headphones and try to ignore it lol."

I have a service dog for my ptsd, and anxiety disorder.
But a horse... a FUCKING HORSE. I can already imagine the scene. This made me laugh for some reason. Dogs are highly intelligent animals who can be trained to work along side humans... but a horse? Idk man, next thing you know we’ll have emotional support ducks. Jk, I don’t think you’re an asshole. I would have laughed too."

She shouldn’t be telling you that she will call you back when she knows she probably won’t, she should just not tell you.  Also, she doesn’t have to call you every night, that sounds like controlling behavior."

He has every right to not talk to his family anymore. He cannot he forced. Also, just because you got your family a gift doesn’t mean he has to. Why are you even mad if he bought an anime figure with the money YOU sent him, it’s not yours anymore. Also, what a shitty thing of you to do to tell your family he didn’t want to give you money. I can see why he has isolated himself from you all."

offmychest,fcsmklv,t1_fcsljdc,1577919758.0,How about NO. Are you fucking retarded? A poor puppy who is teething and can’t help itself deserves to get shocked. How about you wear a shock collar and I control it and shock you every time you say something stupid just like now?
offmychest,fcsm9je,t3_eip2qd,1577919554.0,"Surprise! Puppies aren’t sunshine and rainbows. People don’t really know that dogs (especially puppies) take A LOT of patience, responsibility and care. Don’t get a dog if you can’t handle biting, barking, or them eating your favorite new $60 shoes. Ok but seriously, you should re-home the puppy to a family who have the patience for it. 
However, if you really don’t want to give it away, then it’s going to take a lot of patience. Almost ALL puppies bite. Usually because they are teething. Get it some toys, or if not honestly, you’ll just have to be patient and they will grow out of it. Also, DO NOT GET A SHOCK COLLAR like the other ignorant person said. If you’re debating on getting a shock collar then just give the puppy away to a better family."

Bro what the fuck. You do know that you could die from a dog bite. You said it’s still bleeding right? That means the wound is still open and bacteria could easily make its way inside there if it hasn’t already. Also, your sister should be held responsible and train her dog or the common excuse “if she doesn’t have time” then hire a dog trainer. Why get a dog if you won’t take care of it? Please go to the hospital now!"
