bulletjournal,feo0hm9,t1_fenzx5g,1579293505.0,How much time do you invest in making them? I know there are some people who spend tons of time on them? I’m just trying to get a feel for it because I know if I don’t set good time limits then I will get too crazy and I will never use it

bipolar,fegnw1o,t1_fegncsa,1579098307.0,"I definitely understand where you are coming from. It is a good thing that you are seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. Yes, they are expensive but they are worth it. Meds are complicated. It is a lot of trial and error. Once you get the right combo you will see a difference. As for maintaining relationships, it is a struggle. Most of the time, honesty is the key to keeping those relationships. For me personally, I feel like I want to be depressed. I hate mania. And sometimes I find that I try to force myself into depression because I like the idea of not feeling like being alive anymore. Believing in yourself is difficult, even when you are the most stable. It is mostly about little victories, like waking up or taking a shower. It sounds so corny, but I believe in you and all the progress you will make."
