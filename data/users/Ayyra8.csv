You're right that most people follow Islam, but there's not much choice to follow a different ideology (as long as you're trying to be accepted).

Thanks for being so kind and humble. I'm happy a lot of people are interested in Iran."

TrueOffMyChest,fdcdsnb,t1_fd9and9,1578272443.0,"I thought it was obvious that Persians and Arabs are two separate people's with different language. That's why when I saw the YSK post I got frustrated, it became apparent how little some people know."
TrueOffMyChest,fdcdoly,t1_fda5ivf,1578272367.0,"No, and I really shouldn't have labeled it like that. The British people are perfectly normal, and British history is fascinating. My family despises the British government of the past for their oil-driven actions, and as their child a lot about the ""dirty, secretive, Britsh"" has been drilled into me.

 I'm sorry to have insulted you like that, it's not right in a world where people are unique in their own opinions about their government."
TrueOffMyChest,fdcdbsw,t1_fda5i08,1578272130.0,"I really appreciate your love of learning, and I definitely shouldn't have gone out on a limb and labeled all Redditors/Americans as ignorant. I was just frustrated at the amount of fear about Iran, when it's a unique place of it's own."
TrueOffMyChest,fdbqjm2,t1_fdb1ru9,1578260356.0,"You make a good point, I shouldn't have made such a sweeping generalization. I've met some students from the UK and they were great people, so I probably should have specified my feelings about the British Government instead of the people in general."

TrueOffMyChest,fd846kb,t1_fd82l8g,1578213704.0,"Yeah, I guess you do make a good point that a lot of these people are legitimately scared. I definitely understand why the prospect of war is scary, but I'm frustrated about the general misinformation."

I've been mistaken for Arab plenty of times, and while it does frustrate me because of how different the cultures are, the fault shouldn't be placed on Americans themselves.

The fault should be placed on the lack of focus on education about different cultures in the American classroom."

However, revamping the crumbling education system in Iran with more Liberal values would be a good start  in conjunction with more strict laws that allow the freedom to practice religion and speak against those in power. I truly believe the best way to have freedom is to focus on educating the public, but then again I'm not a politician."

Was the Shah perfect? Far from it, despite what my nationalistic family may believe. The fact of the matter was that a small minority managed to trick the population into allowing anti-Persian Mullahs into the government, and it's been downhill in terms of freedom and economic prosperity ever since."
news,fcwrqlx,t1_fcw9rp0,1578034970.0,"Thank you for the voice of reason, and this is coming from a man with family in Iran.

The Theocratic Regime has disappeared family members of mine. They've also executed numerous homosexuals, atheists, and people who took issue with Khomeini.

What was once a nation with a burgeoning economy, a legacy of religous tolerance, and a center for the beginning of basic human rights was bastardized by religious conservatives that broke their promises and created a real Handmaid's Tale.

The United States has a massive amount of intolerance and personal issues, but the ideals this nation was founded upon include the freedom of religion and speech. They aren't implemented correctly, but they're part of our fundamentals. We need to push for these fundamentals as good citizens. I'm tired of people defending a murderous Theocratic regime with a democracy."
politics,fcwr354,t1_fcwqver,1578034267.0,Fuck you. Iran's treatment of it's own citizens and country is inexcusable. If this is what it takes to spark a revolution against the regressive Islamic theocracy and return my country to a center for free thought and religious tolerance then so be it.
worldnews,fcwqxhm,t1_fcweujv,1578034105.0,"Thank you so much. I'm surprised that so many Redditors seem to hold pro-theocratic views for the Iranian Regime. The United States is far from perfect, but the actions against dissidents to the theocracy in Iran disgusts me and shames the legacy of religious tolerance."
worldnews,fcwqoia,t1_fcwjghn,1578033841.0,"He is not worshiped by all, maybe by a boot-licking minority, in Iran. My family is Persian, and we are celebrating his death.  The theocracy is a monster especially when including the atrocities of the revolutionary guard."
