To be blunt, I don't think you have. Seeing someone on a 'non-exclusive basis' often gets heard as ""I'm emotionally committed to you, but I might sleep around."" The reality is that you have feelings for two women who each believed that they were the only woman you had feelings for.

You're going to need to come clean and you might lose both relationships. This is why it's always better to be both up-front and specific.

The acronym I always hear for consent is **FRIES**: Freely given, Reversible, Informed, Enthusiastic, and Specific.

Keeping things vague like ""this isn't an exclusive relationship"" is more likely to get you a ""yes"" in the short term, but that isn't actually consent. If you're going to have an emotional relationship with more than one woman, you have to be clear about that and let your partner(s) know *before* you have sex or fall in love with someone else--or at least be clear that you don't intend to give them a heads up."
AskFeminists,ff6fmdm,t1_ff5lohk,1579626146.0,">suggesting that men have to somehow address the issue because it’s related to masculinity.

I mean, A) That's true, we do need to address the issue because it is related, andB) Those call outs are still a vocal minority far outside the mainstream. The default of American media is to treat the violence of minorities as systemic and to treat the violence of white men as the work of rogue individuals. This is evidenced in the reluctance of US law enforcement to treat white supremacist groups as terrorists, despite a series of explicit terrorist attack.

Treating the actions of white men as systemic is deserved because white men *control the systems of our society*, they are the explicit heads of state, law enforcement, the legal system, etc. Even in the case that violence by minorities *is* systemic, those systems are usually owned and operated by the majority and imposed on minorities. White men are in control of the very systems they impose on themselves, which is why it's a good idea to call them out on the terrible results of these systems.

Fortunately, some circles of men like /r/menslib are taking the challenge of positive masculinity seriously, but that's still a small sliver of society.

Lastly, intersectional feminism is intersectional: White men who suffer from poverty, mental illness, disability etc. are also marginalized and not in control of these systems and suffer under them."

So I don't believe any modality of therapy can actually do this, regardless of what its practitioners claim.

Therapy really started to click for me when I started seeing my therapist as a personal trainer and not a ""brain mechanic"" if that makes sense. She can't go in my head and fix anything, she can just give me the tools and encouragement I need to do it myself.

To that end, I've started devoting 15+ minutes each day to feeling myself, my body, and my emotions and trying to discover the emotions I am feeling but not expressing. 90% of it is just nasty stuff: feelings I don't want to know about, feelings I wish weren't real, feelings that are just awkward for me and other people that I don't want to talk about--ever--to anyone. And I try to uncover them anyway, and acknowledge that they are real anyway, and talk about them to relevant people in my life anyway--because the emotions you fail to find never fail to find you.

I've gotten tremendous progress this way and I'm convinced that mental health really isn't any different from physical health: some people are just healthy and never have to work on it (screw those people!), most people need to devote some time and effort to get and stay healthy, some people need to devote a lot of time and effort just to get to a normal level of health.

I'd say the world revolves around whatever aspect of life you are failing the hardest at, whether that's your career, or enacting social change, or your relationship with your parents, etc. Trivializing the need for love and sex does not solve anything, it just ignores the problem. Our species would not have survived if love and sex (and subsequently children) were not important and worth fighting for and making great sacrifices for.

That's kind of a false dichotomy. When I found the Venn Diagram of things I like that I can use to socialize, I started making new friends and lovers. Pretty much all of them were outside my comfort zone, so some of us have to stretch a lot more than others to meet people.

Additionally, not everyone is good enough to be dateable, and many incels just lack the baseline level of emotional intelligence required to have a good relationship. Women in this culture are not taught to bury there emotions as deeply as men and are not abused as badly as men for expressing emotion in a social context.

Yes, because it was a distortion of a real moral compass; a simplified set of deeply internalized rules and norms that you never had to question.

In order to develop a real moral compass, you have to develop empathy. You have to learn to feel what other people are feeling and interact with them to see if your feelings are accurate--if you can describe what it's like to be them in a way that they feel seen and validated. Whatever you feel compelled to do out of that empathy is the beginning of a real moral compass. The trial and error of what *works* when you apply your empathy will help you develop a mature morality.

This is where having a therapist, even for a little while, can really help. Effort is not skill and simply having the effort to think about moral issues doesn't mean you're doing it right. Having someone to bounce ideas off really alleviates the stress of thinking on your own and if you find a therapist who's really empathetic (many are, especially women in my experience) then they'll have a lot to teach you.

A capitalist company cannot satisfy our desires, because that would destroy the ""market"" which allows to exist, it can only provide substitutes: porn instead of sex, junk food instead of nourishment, guns instead of safety, etc.

Additionally, a capitalist company has every incentive to create desires where none exist: grief is a pathology, you need a prescription; human bodies look like photoshop, you need plastic surgery; suffering is unnatural, you need more money; etc.

The leftist alternative to TRP is to simply **become a more loving person**. Women might do some crazy shit for the money or social status they get from Chads, but they will do *anything* for love (men and non-binary folks too, if you're into that). Additionally, the *quality* of relationships you can get by improving your emotional intelligence is vastly superior to what you can get with TRP. Do you really want a relationship that's just a war with you trying to extort sex and a woman trying to extort money and status? Mutually loving supportive relationships are what everyone is really after, but you have to learn how to love, it's not something you're born with and you can't buy it at a store, you have you build it in yourself, brick by brick.

Once you learn compassion (which is a hard and takes time) you'll be much more able to love yourself, which makes being alone far more bearable and means you have far less at stake when you start going out, being sociable, and talking to women. The whole ""I'm gonna off myself if this goes sideways"" vibe is not what you want to emanate when starting a conversation. You have to be safe within yourself before you ask another person to meet you there."

This is the intellectual's version of anti-intellectualism; the argument boils down to: *I'm smart, so if I have trouble understanding something, it must be wrong.*

Chomsky literally doesn't know what he's talking about.

I don't think it's exactly *necessary* to understand the whole of continental philosophy to understand any piece of it, but if you find yourself mystified by it, that's the surest way to correct your misperception.

And yes, continental philosophy is needlessly obscure at times because Kant was a terrible writer and Hegel realized that a brilliant idea and an obscure writing style was a ticket to job security, but the ideas they're struggling with *are* legitimately complicated.

If you want a clean, elegant explanation of this tradition--and you really believe it's possible--you should take the time to study the philosophers and write it yourself. No one's done it yet, and I think that's for a good reason, but that doesn't mean it won't happen in the future."

Does this study make you think you *should* worry more about being raped? Most men not only dismiss the possibility that they could be raped, but they dismiss the accounts of *actual men who have been raped*, because the biggest part their privilege is never having to think about it.

When you become aware of your own vulnerability, you're not only better able to protect yourself, but you naturally feel compassion for those more vulnerable than you. If you can imagine yourself being a victim, you're already a big step towards accounting for your privilege.

Privilege is a debt of empathy you owe to those less fortunate."
