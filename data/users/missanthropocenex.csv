videos,ffcvwe9,t1_ffbyww6,1579808362.0,"Growing up, one of my childhood best friends' Dad was a Judge. One day (I think the day of, or the day before thanks giving) we're driving in his truck and get nailed by a speed trap. It was so ridiculous the Cop ran out into the road and pulled us over on foot. It was a blatant gotcha joke of a speed trap.

The policeman pulled my friends Dad over and asked for his license/registration. My Friends Dad, obliged handed him his regular ID and the Officer walked away to run the tag.

When he did my friend said ""Dad! What are you doing, flash him the Judges badge!"" he said, no and to sit tight. If he HAD given the judge badge this whole matter would have been instantly over.

The Officer runs the tag and comes back and hands him the ticket, condensendingly saying this is fine, and this is the court date he could appear.

My friends Dad calmly asked ""Wait, what's the court date again"" the Officer answered. To which the he replied ""You know, I'm not going to be able to make that date, I'll be Judging at that courthouse that day"" The cop went, pale white and swallowed hard. ""W-well, alright then...sorry about all that! You have a very good day sir! Take care."" The Cop looked scared shitless.

It turns out there's nothing worse ever, than getting on a Judges bad side, and being allowed to hand out a ticket to him was a worse offense than had he not have. He essentially punished the guy worse by NOT giving him the ID than if he'd had.

I'd never seen a police officer look like he had shit himself like that either. Good times."

Showerthoughts,ff9ui7i,t1_ff92r2y,1579721652.0,"Honestly there’s a business model reason you see this. If you actually look at Disney 2D animated films you actually can track a “decline” in quality. See Disney started with the game Changing Snow White. Followed by Pinocchio, Dumbo Fantasia ect. All masterpieces. The problem is this quality is INCREDIBLY expensive to execute and while it’s great to be setting the highest bar, over a long enough timeline this process becomes unfeasible and unsustainable.

By the time they got to 101 Dalmatians they switched to a different transfer process that was MUCH quicker, cheaper and more effective.

The problem is there becomes a steep drop off in line work and visual quality. Disney continued with this process for many films, and their reputation for quality essentially vanished.

They hit a breaking point with Black Cauldron and switched back for The Little Mermaid which was hailed a return to the golden age for Disney Animation.

The bottom line is money is everything and studios will literally cut every corner possible until people speak out with their wallets. As soon as they do, they work Harder to provide a better product.

This is the cycle, for better or for worse."

movies,ff7109j,t1_ff70jm6,1579638968.0,"That’s the whole point of the post though. Disney + is a brand new business model that allows certain types of content to exist that previously couldn’t. Star Wars has basically just learned that these tertiary second tier stories probably are best off in TV format as The Mandalorian has just proven ( Note that the New Obi wan property will now also be a D+ show and not a film as previously discussed.

Same goes for other Disney properties like some of the live action remakes, like Lady and the Tramp, a film that probably wouldn’t have gained enough momentum at the box office but worked just fine for home viewing.

Also don’t ever think Disney is above making something because they have “enough” of it. Disney will cannibalize, remake and seek to prophet off of anything that has an inkling of a chance of doing that for them."

It is so. Good.

It’s a film that while isn’t the most original premise nails it when I t comes to the details.

It’s all the subtle stuff that actually sells the film as much more plausible than it could have been.

Elizabeth Olsens character could easily have been villianized and yet they make sure to portray her as actually a fairly nice person who is maybe more oblivious than anything.

And Aubrey Plaza was born for this role. No one else could have embodied this character."

I’ll go as far as to say both Ultron AND Iron Man 2 have a lot more value when viewed in retrospect as they both harken to elements that come into play majorly later. Ironically it’s not as enjoyable at the time but when you look back after the later events it makes the films much more enjoyable.

I.e Tony’s Scarlett Witch “Nightmare” packs a much stronger punch when you realize it harkens to the events of Endgame and calls ahead to his ultimate demise.

Similarly for Iron Man, seeing Caps prototype shield and all well later learn about the relationship of his father and preconceived notions of Captain America make it more interesting.

Interestingly, only a week ago there was a press release walking back the “horror” component of this film. Feige stated something to the degree that Horror components could be found in many films like Temple Of Doom without necessarily being considered straight up horror movies.

I have a feeling DS2 will play a similar role as Ultron or Iron Man 2 in terms of segue world building films for better or for worse.


I can easily see Feige getting cold feet on taking a risk on a film that will serve as such a pillar and not  allow it to veer off into niche straight Horror territory."
