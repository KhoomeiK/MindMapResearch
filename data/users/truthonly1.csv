It can be very harmful to disregard someone's mental health issue. 
You say you want evidence....attempted suicide? Decline in hygiene? Constant crying?  ""evidence"" isn't so apparent for most. Most hide it well and will guard themselves against majority of people in their life which in turn isolates them and makes it worse...
It sounds like you have people in your life who milk it...that upsets me because it takes away the legitimacy of others.

TrueOffMyChest,fczec3y,t1_fczbd04,1578099275.0,"I can understand that point of view. But it's a fine line to assume someone is faking it. 
It's that stigma.....most people will experience depression and anxiety...it's when it becomes long term...the affects on the body and mind can be very harmful. 
Don't assume someone is joining a ""trend"" as that perpetuates the stigma. Some people are very high functioning while having severe depression and anxiety."

AmItheAsshole,fcwt5qb,t3_ejbw54,1578036570.0,"NTA- sucks to be in that situation but you are a good best man! Definitely send another reminder and let them  know that all money is required at the beginning of the trip at the latest? 
I went through this with my friends wedding and ended up paying for a lot of it myself as people usually want to join and have fun but go weird when asked to pitch in...especially if someone else has already paid"
AmItheAsshole,fcwsk5e,t3_ejbywe,1578035887.0,NTA- it sounds like it was plutonic. Definitely need to talk it out with him. Hope it all goes well!
AmItheAsshole,fcwr51l,t3_ej1n0f,1578034324.0,NTA.. good for you for saying something!
AmItheAsshole,fcwognd,t1_fcvynbe,1578031615.0,"I am a woman and have known a lot of women like this....doesn't come off great...fine... Doesn't stop it from being true that women like this are out there. Their behaviour shows who they are. 
As a woman....this upsets me."
AmItheAsshole,fcva1vy,t3_ej2r7a,1577997775.0,NTA...but let it go....you just paid 15$ to never have to deal with that asshole again
AmItheAsshole,fcv90zn,t3_ej2u6s,1577997160.0,NTA- they are the AH...dumb girls thinking they are that hot shit to get some random guy who they spoke to for 2mins to buy their drinks all night and not even hang out together? Maybe if they were hanging with you and kept ordering....maybe....entitled bitches...can't stand em
AmItheAsshole,fcv4ufn,t3_eizz56,1577994678.0,YTA- you were so reasonable at the beginning then boom bridezilla. I would have reacted the same way....you're saying you have the choice of kids or inlaws ...well you're making her choose between you and her child! Shame on you. Of course she chooses her child. Enjoy your wedding with the in laws you don't ever see
AmItheAsshole,fcuqgkj,t3_eiz578,1577986429.0,"NTA- I was raised Muslim as my dad is but my mom was Catholic and never converted...for people who don't understand this...in Islam...the children must be brought up by the father's religion. I don't think your an asshole because you explained this all before marriage and children and she agreed....now she doesn't. What changed? 
Now I was raised but have decided since to be agnostic in my later years...personal reasons. If taught correctly...like any religion....it should not impact your child in the future . Always keep that communication open to discuss other religions.
That being said....I knew from a young age that Islam was not for me...really any organized religion hence being agnostic...but was forced to pray and fast etc...I never did it for myself...which also soured me on the whole things. Teach it....invite your children to participate...ask questions... explore."
