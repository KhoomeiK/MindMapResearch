birthcontrol,fc7jsyi,t1_fc7itgg,1577509686.0,"I think it was about 2-4 week, unfortunately"
birthcontrol,fc7i31h,t3_egk4ag,1577508106.0,"Yeah, I got the mirena iud and I definitely had the WORST cramping ever. It lasted a while, but man, it was terrible. Pain for hours and hours that made it so I couldn't talk/function well. It stopped after a bit, and my iud has been the most amazing thing since then. Not any pain with it or anything, except maybe a little stronger cramps with my period every now and then (but I've had it for years, so it might be normal for me, I can't remember). My periods have improved 10 billion percent, so I'd keep at it for a while longer, if you can. It should get better! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
