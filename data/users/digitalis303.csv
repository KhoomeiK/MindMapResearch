politics,ffg4z8n,t1_fffturn,1579898571.0,"I don't think it is that simple. I make about $60k. But I managed to squeeze through college in the 90s with financial aid and scholarships to graduate debt-free. I also lived at home during that time. Most aren't so lucky. I also live in a modest house and live frugally (my car is 11 years old), and I don't really indulge in expensive hobbies. Other people might be one paycheck from missing a mortgage payment with my same income."

She is not wealthy by any stretch, but she moved to Germany by herself then moved back and is still doing okay. BUT it is outrageously expensive by our terms. She is also incredibly frugal and has no kids, so..."
politics,ffg45ck,t1_fffr0q2,1579898063.0,I'm not saying things aren't totally F'd. But to say that I am somehow in the same category as people in Appalachia or the Mississippi delta who have no way out of destitution is ridiculous. There are all kinds of things wrong with our system. I just think the idea of claiming it's as black and white as rich and poor oversimplified.
politics,fffpomp,t1_ffflt31,1579889094.0,I see you are living up to your username... I probably make somewhere between $50k and $50B.
politics,fffku7x,t1_fffh2x6,1579886137.0,"That's a bit of an exaggeration. I definitely consider myself a middle class, educated, teacher. I live frugally, but comfortably. Could I get injured, not be able to work, and lose my home? Sure. But the lack of a social safety net is not the same as no middle class. With that said, it's still a huge problem and the middle class does keep shrinking with greater income inequality."
DIY,fffkitq,t1_fffe6sd,1579885942.0,Pocket doors also require a lot of carpentry and structural modifications to the wall. It is a pretty big deal. They may also not want a door that obstructs airflow/the whole vertical aspect of the hall.
politics,fffjkw9,t3_etayz3,1579885350.0,Jimmy Kimmel did an awesome piece on Lindsey Graham showing how far he has swung from being anti-Trump to crawled-up-and-died-in-Trump's-ass level of support fo him. [Here you go.](https://youtu.be/_ErhFJz_AtY?t=326)
WTF,fffc1m3,t1_fff925o,1579880651.0,Cold temperature = less kinetic energy = slower metabolism. Bacteria/fungi grow/divide slower and spoilage is delayed. It still happens though. Which is why you should throw your leftovers out after a few days ya heathen.

todayilearned,ffcib9p,t1_ffceey0,1579800069.0,I dunno. I find the stuff about plant/animal domestication and disease interesting and a lot of that seems to be based on geography (the large swath of Eurasia being at a similar latitude seems important). I just wish the book was a bit more pared down. He seems to go on and on about a lot of things that could be summarized more concisely.
todayilearned,ffc75ay,t3_essg35,1579793091.0,"You might enjoy the book ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" By Jared Diamond.

WTF,ffb0gk2,t1_ff9v0gr,1579748748.0,"[You might want to read this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4288294/). Basically mass and speed determine how much kinetic energy transfers in a collision. If a large vehicle hits a small one it will definitely do more damage to the small one due to the momenta of the two vehicles. But what if a truck hits something large or solid (bridge pylon, barrier wall, tractor-trailer, etc). There's going to e a lot of momentum, and thus kinetic energy transfer. This means a lot of damage to the truck. A small, lightweight car will have little momentum, and thus will incur less damage (all other things being equal). Think about a lightweight styrofoam car hitting something. It would essentially just bounce off with little damage even though styrofoam is flimsy."
WTF,ff94ekw,t1_ff8nli7,1579704576.0,"This makes me wonder about Tesla's Cybertruck. One of the things they have been bragging about is how tough it is due to the thick stainless steel ""exoskeleton"". I would think this would seriously hamper crumple zones and impact absorption. Perhaps I'm missing something. Or perhaps Elon is full of shit."

With that said, this has been the passion project of [Stephen Gaghan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0300866/?ref_=tt_ov_dr) for several years. He's the guy who did Syriana and wrote Traffic.

There are LOTS of pro-Trump Alabamans who voted for Jones (I know it's crazy, but they did) and will turn on him instantly if he votes to convict. There are tons of moderate Dems who will turn on him if he votes to acquit.  [He's in a no win situation.

movies,fen4nxb,t3_epr8ev,1579276885.0,"I don't think it can save them. Streaming media is going to end up doing what most other industries do- consolidating until only a few big heavyweights remain.  I don't think they will be one of them. Netflix is bleeding money left and right trying to build content because they have to. Most of their top content is licensed to them and the content owners are constantly pulling it and generating their own streaming services. 

The ones who survive are going to be the ones with the deepest pockets who can afford to weather this war. Those will be Amazon and Disney. There might be a few others who make it, but I doubt Netflix will. That said, I like Netflix, but it's no coincidence that Disney undercut them on price right out of the gate. They can afford to hold out for years and wait for Netflix to die."

todayilearned,fei3ehh,t1_fehtgjn,1579129403.0,"I prefer DS2 to 1. It feels very similiar in vibe (mostly), but improves a lot of the mechanics and game play IMO. DS3 is a a shitshow though."
todayilearned,fei39po,t1_fehgu4i,1579129319.0,Absolutely! More than Alien I would say. I would also say Event Horizon was heavily influenced by Alien. All great franchises BTW.
todayilearned,fei34ct,t1_fehcden,1579129225.0,"The aesthetic vibe is definitely similar in some ways. Especially the tension of knowing shit is going to go down, but not knowing when. Dead space is way more about the gore though. Love both and I'm currently replaying the DS series. I don't know why I'm so obsessed with those games (well 1&2 anyway), but I wish there were more games like that."
todayilearned,fehmxli,t1_fehjaih,1579119798.0,"In electronics many of the knockoffs are made using substandard parts. Things that fail QA testing, but still function.

Louisville,feek41j,t1_feeg8gm,1579035366.0,That seems pretty dang reasonable.
Louisville,feec6cu,t3_em9vgy,1579030738.0,"While there is some truth to the claims about failing infrastructure (bursting water mains along Eastern Parkway being a prime example), most of these costs are about what are called [CSOs (Combined Sewer Overflows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev64xXDYmaw). When our sewer system was built forever and a day ago (before sewage treatment) it was designed to collect all of the sewage into bigger and bigger pipes and then dump it into the Ohio river in the west end. However, when it rains, too much water flows into the system and pushes the combined sewage and rainwater over a weir (low wall in the pipes) so that it flows out to local streams (like Beargrass creek). Ever wonder why the creek in Cherokee park has all of those warnings and smells like shit? Well, wonder no more! Anyway, to fall in line with federal regs the city has been going crazy building [huge retention cisterns (think giant underground boxes) all over town to hold these surges of sewage and then slowly release it into the system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaVehI3AWGs). Most modern construction separates storm sewers from septic lines. This is why you see big basin-like areas around most new development. It catches, then slowly releases stormwater. This project to remove all of the CSOs (and thus sewage in the creeks) is costs a shit-ton of money (actually many tons of shit...). Source: I teach environmental science and have talked with the water company/MSD about it.

TLDR: This isn't really about paying for failing infrastructure (this time); it's about paying for previous generations' environment ignorance.

Bonus: This is also why there are lots of incentives to disconnect your gutters from the sewer system and install a rain garden."

Aesthetically though I prefer the 2nd gen to the others (even if it's over a decade old). I just couldn't warm up to how ""plump"" the 3rd gen looked. I also HATE the trend of body panel creasing that is going on and there was way too much of it in the 3rd gen. These new models seem to have toned that down, but it is a bit too cutesy for me though.

I might even be *sort of* okay with that if the story was strong. But it wasn't. The plot is ham-fisted in and nostalgic. Then disjointed. There were random side-stories we didn't need. (Why the Zori/Poe relationship?) We should have seem trauma haunt Finn. We should have seen more hints at darkness in Rey. We should have seen Poe as a bit of a scoundrel through more of the story.
