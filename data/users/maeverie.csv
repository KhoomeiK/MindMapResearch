bulletjournal,fcxqdfe,t1_fcupqcg,1578068964.0,"i don't do any drawings and only use 1 color scheme but few of my pens bleed through. i'm mainly using a stabilo 0.4 fineliner alongside staedler fineliners and triplus pens. i also occasionally use a staedler metallic marker and it never bled through. as for markers, i use one from milan and it works great (it's similar to crayola supertips). i've used a faber castell brush pen as well and had no issues :)"
