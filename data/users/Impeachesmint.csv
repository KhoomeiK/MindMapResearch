That is their suspect, that is the suspect on the official pages.  Dumb people on the internet muddy the waters and think it’s confusing, but they are just dumb people on the internet."
DelphiMurders,ffnzabj,t1_ffeb1ce,1580072564.0,First two things have been known for some time.   I don’t even remember where from now.  But it’s been remarked about for a long time here.
DelphiMurders,ffnyn3v,t3_esz2sk,1580072334.0,"Does every new episode need to be announced here?  If someone is subscribed to it, they’ll see it."
DelphiMurders,ffnxb7v,t1_fffdbgm,1580071950.0,"If you look at LE information regarding the suspect (FBI, ISP websites for example) they only present the one sketch (the one released most recently).  I don’t think that leaves room for confusion, at all.

It’s just dumb people on the internet doing dumb shit who are ‘confused’.  They think they are part of the investigation and run off on their stupid theories and trying to match people to a sketch they think is most correct.  Even seen it here, people fully stating that “I think the first sketch is the right guy, I don’t even bother looking at the new one”."

You have far too much confidence in your ideas."
DelphiMurders,ffnube3,t1_ffgast4,1580070928.0,"They didn’t specifically say “we are looking to contact this guy because he’s a person of interest” no, but the fact that they were looking to contact him ‘regarding what he might have seen’ makes him a person of interest to the investigation.  A POI isn’t a term reserved for someone who they think ‘did it’, a person of interest is someone who is or could be relevant to the investigation for a number of reasons.

They were interested in talking to him, he was a person of interest."
DelphiMurders,ffntpyq,t1_fff8txj,1580070688.0,"It was not a long time, it was only a few days between announcing him as merely a POI, to then a suspect."

Not sure if just making names up or what at this point.


*Wow okay, it actually is a real streaming service."
