My vocab is failing me. And it seems so inauthentic. This has nothing to do with the Hendrix allegations--which I believe-- either. 

I think the people saying it should've been Jay Briscoe are right."
SquaredCircle,fffempa,t1_fffcxft,1579882286.0,"the g1 matches? I remember the one with White being great because they really played around with the expectations and wants of the audience, how they absolutely wanted Naito to win, really toyed with it. The first two Ibushi ones were good because Ibushi nearly killed himself both times, really committed himself. Don't remember the Ishii or Shingo matches. 

I'll say that of all the WK double gold matches, the Naito ones were the weakest. Okada and Naito was very good, but Okada's the best in the world. I do want to say that Naito wasn't bad, he was very good. Just not as good as the best in njpw"

BigJapanWrestling,fefq7io,t1_fedlu20,1579062093.0,"thanks! so that was the deal with that Suzuki-Uto match. I was kinda confused when I saw it. I like Uto too, I hope he can find something to build on. And I'll say  this, I'm not into Hyodo's new gear. Ultimately, that means next to nothing in bjw-- Nakanoue is one of my faves and he has some bad gear and the worst hair in all of wrestling probably-- but I liked him in the trunks. I like when the husky guys go without the shirt, esp. when they're as athletic as Hyodo. 

What's the read on Kato? He seems very competent in the bjw style, is he someone people are high on?"
SquaredCircle,fefp274,t1_fef36fs,1579061264.0,yeah i agree with all of that. esp. that point about American wrestling being like primetime tv
SquaredCircle,feeti3i,t1_fees0w9,1579040874.0,I think pretty much. I think add an element of good ultimately prevails while evil gets their comeuppance. you're supposed to learn a lesson in how to behave from it.
SquaredCircle,feet62q,t1_feerper,1579040671.0,"yeah, I never really thought of it but there is definitely a lot of pageantry to American wrestling. maybe its that the American pageantry tries to be more naturalistic, even though its super exaggerated, while the Lucha style is more stereotypical, like ishingundan's point where good is technique and bad is brawling and so on."
SquaredCircle,fees0i8,t1_feequmu,1579039966.0,yeah that is interesting. kind of archetypal (sorry I'm indulging myself)
SquaredCircle,feeqclp,t1_feeojx5,1579038977.0,"i was thinking the same thing. I almost never watch Lucha, but it always seems to have a strong good vs evil thing but very stylized. I'm struggling to describe it, the best I can come up with is it's presented like a fable.

I've seen Tessa and Statlander about the same amount of times, and Statlander immediately struck me as having good psychology and putting together good matches, working smoothly, all the stuff you mentioned, in a way that Tessa didn't. I think the only thing Tessa is better at is talking. But I think Statlander is way more charismatic too. Being athletic doesn't disqualify you from being great at the mental things. I think Statlander is a serious natural, she understands wrestling."

njpw,fdsm97j,t1_fdsgkdn,1578705039.0,"I think Naito did reach the highest peak with the double championship, Kenta just ruined the denouement. And that he ruined the special moment gives Naito that much stronger of a boost. All that might not have been worth ruining the moment. But I think it was worth it. 

You are right that it would have been a more memorable picture without the interruption. It'd be a lot cleaner. Now you won't be able to look back on it without remembering, or intentionally omitting, the run-in. But ,again, I think it was worth it."
njpw,fdsbmih,t1_fdr9fbv,1578698876.0,"I don't Naito will necessarily reach the top again. I don't think his IWGP reign will last until summer, and I don't think he'll win it ever again. I think they're looking at it like the proverbial soap opera; there aren't any breaks, new story line is constantly being spun out, always moving to the next thing. I think they just want to keep the LIJ train rolling in its present form for as long as they can. I think they were smart to instantly move him onto the next thing, and in such a big way.

SquaredCircle,fct9vgu,t3_eis95j,1577936791.0,"here it comes, my bullet point list. i'm doing it man!

* it's crazy that pretty much every opening match has been MOTN-worthy. Cody and Darby have great chemistry. The match built off the previous match, which I always like. Darby showed more of his repertoire, really looked the best I think he's looked in AEW, which is saying something. he seemed very comfortable. and I guess all it took for Cody to become one of the best American wrestlers working now was near complete creative control.
* The women's 4-way was really good. great false finishes, Shida with really impressive strength, everyone firing on all cylinders. I have to say I don't love Nyla Rose as a heel. But she was great in-ring. And I love Riho as the champ. because of her size, and the fact that she only wins by flash pins, the outcome of her matches feel more in doubt. and i always root for the little guy.
* Mox and Trent was pretty good. I don't like Trent much because the best friends suck and they're not funny, though orange cassidy rules, and everyone is so eager to pick him as a future star based pretty much on just looks. and performative love for Bill Murray is about the most basic bro shit ever. but he was good in that match, finally making me admit he's a viable singles wrestler. and Mox was pretty good, but I don't love him much either.
* I have trouble remembering Sammy Guevara was on the show. I'm glad he's getting chances so that he can improve, he's got all the potential in the world, but as of right now I think he's mediocre. and Rhodes looks so great in the ring for about five minutes, but after that the match peters out. maybe his psychology isn't great. but i have trouble staying interested.
* i think mjf is overrated
* YBs need to be tag champs. they combine great spot-work, which is what the fans want, and great psychology, which is what the fans need. SCU is like Dustin to me, kind of cool for a few minutes, then I lose interest because the middle lacks momentum and finishes are let-downs. YBs need to be champs because they can put on great matches. Kenny's one of the best ever, he was really good. I love the lucha bros separately, but not together; they bring out the worst in each other. they were good in this match though so maybe i'm wrong. PAC was good, one of the guys in aew who can be counted on to deliver.
* the Page alcoholism angle is really weird, i don't like it much. it was funny when his chyron said ""has been drinking"". I'm turning from indifference towards dislike for Private Party

we could just as well complain about when someone does a piledriver, when they clearly lean back and fall on the upper part of their butt. or people obviously landing on their knees when receiving ddts and facebusters.  leaning back before receiving a clothesline or body press. letting a hurricanrana totally disengage from the receiver before they belatedly flip over. jumping up during chokeslams. clearly not having the head come in contact with the mat for a tombstone. here's a good one: lifting your arms up when catching someone on the outside. i could do this all day. grabbing someone by the top of the head then clearly punching or headbutting their own hand. lowering your head to your opponent to obviously communicate with them.  hitting the ropes at the trot so that you don't catch your opponent off guard for real. maybe i'll add some more later."
