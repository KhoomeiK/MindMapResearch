I  can't really calculate this person's body fat percentage (most online calculators do so by body measurements), but I'm going to guess that this person's estimates of their lean body mass is probably a little bit off."

Past the age of about two, most people are generally expected to hold it until they reach a toilet. If someone is peeing a lot more than usual to a point where it's become a cause for concern, that may be a sign of some sort of medical issue and should probably be discussed with a doctor."
fatlogic,ffvkpec,t3_evf6fw,1580266393.0,"To be fair, it sounds as if OP is trying to build muscle and become more fit in addition to losing weight. Building muscle requires an entirely different strategy as opposed to just cutting to get the numbers down. A calorie deficit is certainly necessary for weight loss, but cutting too much when you're trying to build muscle isn't necessarily good for you, and can fuck with your energy and hunger levels like there's no tomorrow.

 I wouldn't call that ""starvation mode"", but it can make it a lot more difficult to stick to a sensible diet."
fatlogic,ffsu7zs,t3_ev09ex,1580192667.0,"Generally speaking, someone who is concerned about a patient's or loved one's health generally isn't telling them to lose weight because they see the person as less than. They are saying it because they don't want to see you suffer and die from something that is easily preventable. In the case of doctors, it is their job to tell you when something is putting you at risk for disease or death, and it is their job to help you prevent/mitigate said disease and death.

fatlogic,ff56ewf,t1_ff2grgq,1579581549.0,"It really depends on where someone lives. When I lived in a big city, for instance, most places I needed to go were easily within a 2 - 3 mile walking distance. Places that weren't were easily accessible by bus or light rail.

Now, I live in a more suburban area, and a car is an absolute necessity. Most roads don't have sidewalks, shops are a lot more spread apart (and separate from residential areas), and the only public transportation around is this one bus line that basically goes to the mall and to a major city 10 miles away."

Everyday life is more sedentary now. Food is cheaper, more abundant, and more caloric than it's ever been. Most of our diets are either fast food or processed convenience foods, and those are intentionally designed to be addictive and not very filling so you buy more. 

Exercise is no longer an integral part of our lives the way it once was, and so it has become something people must make time for."

Also, it kind of annoys me when FAs drag professional athletes into their ""BMI is inaccurate"" arguments. Gaining enough muscle to throw off the BMI typically takes a lot of effort. If you are not spending a lot of time working out in the gym or working an active as fuck job, it probably isn't muscle."
fatlogic,feuwd45,t3_eqnl77,1579390584.0,"122 pounds, and I eat fast food all the time. Typically, it's something where I've looked up the calories beforehand and got something that fits in with my daily limits. A single cheeseburger, small fries, and zero-calorie drink typically adds up to about 500 calories at McDonalds and 600 calories at Burger King.  A six-piece McNugget meal with the small fries and a zero-calorie drink is also about 500 calories. Depending on what toppings you get, you can get something at Chipotle and have it add up to about 600-650 calories ( I usually don't get cheese or guac on it). Then, there's always getting a salad and non-creamy soup from Panera. You get that with the apple, it's less than 400 calories. You get a 330 calorie sandwich with the 70 calorie soup and the apple, it's about 435 calories total.

Going gluten-free may be necessary because a person has a gluten allergy, celiac disease, or other medical condition that can be exacerbated by gluten.

Vegetarian and vegan lifestyles are usually more about the morality of eating meat than they are about losing weight. Using these lifestyles as a means to lose weight will likely fail catastrophically because there are quite a lot of junk foods available that are vegetarian / vegan. 

I'm really not sure what this person means by ""anything Biggest Loser"". Most contestants on that show tend to gain the weight back because the show doesn't put any of its focus on long-term sustainable habits. When these people go back to their jobs and lives, it becomes impossible to spend 8 hours in the gym every day on 1000 calories, and there is no emphasis on perhaps going to the gym an hour per day and keeping it to their TDEE. Do they do weight-loos boot camps or video programs or something?"
BendyAndTheInkMachine,fecgx48,t3_enuqey,1578973647.0,"I recently got the game for DS for Christmas, and it does seem rather dry without the Steam achievements. 

One thing I absolutely love about the game is the characters, but we kind of have to go outside the game itself to really get to know them. Sammy, for instance, really comes to life as a character if you happen to find that Hot Topic Q & A thing from a few years ago. It's only there you find out that Sammy had a passion for music from an early age, or that he always wanted to go to Coney Island and never got the chance. Little details like that would really flesh out the character if they appeared elsewhere. In the game and book, however, he's mainly just an asshole and nothing else.

Buddy is an interesting character in the book. We get to see his motivations, his dreams, why he chose to work for Joey Drew Studios. We get details on how he needs the job to support his family, so his mother doesn't have to work as hard. We see how he starts to connect with his grandfather after initially being angry about his arrival. We get to see a little bit of Buddy's character in the game, when Buddy sticks by Henry to the end despite clearly knowing what's going to happen to him as a result. Still, it would be nice to get some clues in the game as to who these people were before they fell into madness as a result of the ink."

Whatever underlying situation or psychological issue is causing someone to become malnourished, their physical health problems still stem from not taking in enough food. If someone is malnourished,  the way to solve the type of health problems cause by malnourishment would be to figure out why they are not eating enough and to try to get them to eat.

It's the same way with being morbidly obese. Whatever the underlying cause of the overeating is, the physical health problems still stem from the fact that this person is eating too much. The doctor can recommend certain treatments to keep the illness at bay, but the problem itself would be solved quite a bit better if this person were to stem the overeating."

When you add weight loss to the mix, you get pants that fit in the legs but are so loose in the waist and butt that they slide down your ass all day and need to be constantly pulled up. It is a hell of a lot cheaper to take a needle and thread and adjust the waist than it is to buy new pants every time you lose a few pounds.

That, and women who are a size 0 or 2 likely aren't buying the plus-sized clothes. There is only so much you can take the waist in before you end up with a pointy-looking bulge under where you adjusted. If the pants are a size too big or you have that problem where the pants fit in the legs but are way too big at the waist, it works wonders.

fatlogic,fcwg2qa,t3_ej7f9p,1578024708.0,"Maybe this is just my psychology classes talking, but it always pisses me off when someone intentionally blurs the line between typical behavior and mental disorders. What sets a symptom of a mental disorder apart from typical behavior is often what's referred to as the ""four D's"".

* Deviance: Is this behavior atypical? By itself, a behavior being unusual or odd doesn't classify it as a symptom of a mental disorder. Calorie counting by itself is considered typical and normal to a point where calorie counts are easy to access. The calorie counts are on food labels, on websites, and may be on the menu itself (depending on where you live) for anyone who chooses to count them.

&#x200B;

* Dysfunction: Does this behavior interfere with a person's ability to function in work, school, and relationships? Does it interfere with a person's ability to be mentally present for their job and/or schooling? Does it interfere with a person's ability to carry out the tasks expected of them? For your average dieter who is counting calories, the answer is typically no.

&#x200B;

* Distress: Does this condition cause distress in the individual? With most mental disorders, the individual is typically aware that there is something wrong, even if they don't have an exact diagnosis. 

&#x200B;

* Danger: This factor may not be present in all mental disorders, but it is a BIG factor in eating disorders. Someone with a restrictive eating disorder could starve to death if the issue is not addressed. They could suffer from life-threatening health effects as a result of malnutrition or starvation.

Choosing to forgo something ""tasty"" generally does not go to the extreme or causing harm, distress, or interfering with one's ability to function. Limiting the amount you eat (when it is not taken to a dangerous extreme) does not cause harm or distress and does not interfere with one's ability to function."
