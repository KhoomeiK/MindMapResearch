feminineboys,feermzy,t3_ekz1jp,1579039739.0,"Soo esthetician here, do you use a cleanser? The best way to take care of your skin is to cleanse, exfoliate (but make sure you are not over exfoliating it can cause further irritations and spread bacteria) *USE A TONER* and moisturize (after a shower so that your pores are more open and can absorb it better)  make sure you use an SPF moisturizer the sun is the #1 cause of most damaged skin.  But speak to a dermatologist and see what they say. They will likely put you on a pill that will exfoliate your skin more chemically. If so don’t get any waxing done it will rip your skin. But waxing is a good choice for semi permanent- permanent hair removal, the more the hair follicle is damaged the less hair it’s going to grow back. Hope I could help some!"

They were worried about not being able to relate to the â€œIâ€™m depressed lolâ€ memes and I told them to enjoy life.
