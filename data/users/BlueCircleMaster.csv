todayilearned,ff81q7n,t1_ff7wcqh,1579663699.0,Truman made the right call. Lives were lost because of Mao but they have no one to blame but themselves. The goal was to push the North Koreans back. The goal was achieved. At this point the NATO troops could have gradually withdrawn. So...we are still in Korea to this day. If we had bombed China it would have been similar to present day Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. has to start to learn to have an exit strategy before engaging.

todayilearned,ff1bgja,t1_fezsolt,1579477151.0,"My father and his friends, all black, joined the Army and fought in Korea. My father was shot twice and was a disabled vet. One of his friends got captured by the red Chinese. He stated that the Chinese treated him well and tried to educate him. He also stated that if the North Koreans had captured him they would have mutilated him. MY dad did do a semester at Harvard B school before dropping out and was able to get a government job at a VA hospital wrestling patients as an orderly. Still he had to leave Tennessee because he couldn't find work. I never asked him or any of my family why the hell did they go and fight!"

science,fecux09,t1_fecg5or,1578985595.0,Same here. I look to see if Trump has done something seriously dangerous to the U.S. and the world or he is just spouting nonsense. I keep telling myself that any rule or law can be reversed and any wall can be torn down. It may take 20 years but America can re-establish itself as a nation of hope and goodwill. What I do want is stronger and enforceable constraints on future Presidents that stray to far from reality. Left or right.

In other words, your new boss cannot show up on day one and verbally state or write that all employees in a protective group are fired because he or she doesn't like your kind."
wikipedia,fdm9s66,t3_em3gz0,1578543383.0,"I watched these shows as a kid. Years later I   re-watched them and laughed my head off.  These shows were so well written. I had missed a lot of the jokes because I was too young to understand. If you have to watch one, watch Green Acres. Love Mr. Haney!"
AskReddit,fd44nri,t1_fd3ea6a,1578164411.0,"On a family road trip we stopped in Chicago for four days. The time was nowhere near enough. So much to do and the architecture and how the city presents itself is stunning. Use common sense and you will be fine. Still, I like to visit the ""bad areas"" of cities. Sometimes the crime is overhyped by the media."
