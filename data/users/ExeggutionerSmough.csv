EDH,ff6jnm1,t3_ervfdj,1579628623.0,"I dont think a 7 mana thing that doesnt immediately put you ahead with some sort of ETB or other similar effect is an auto include in any deck honestly. The card is obviously super powerful at face value but it certainly shouldn't just be jammed into any green deck. Heck, I won't be playing it in my mono green deck even since mine is a more low to the ground stompy deck. By the time I have 7 mana in that deck I want to be trying to close out the game, not putting a target on my head and passing. This is a combo card for cheating out and immediately winning the game with a fat spell imo. But I'm also not an expert."
AskReddit,fetw883,t3_eqjrvi,1579380633.0,Any of the dark souls series' games. Something about that game and its universe just absolutely captivates me.
AskReddit,fekdusn,t3_epj100,1579197979.0,Castle Crashers! Absolutely loved that game and just found out they have it on the switch. My son and I have been playing games a little too often lately because of it.
AskReddit,feia1gp,t3_ep7tm4,1579133648.0,Almost anything by Brand New. Specially off of deja entendu.
AskReddit,fdzdk46,t1_fdzd88r,1578789214.0,I love the zoo and the new show with the Irwin's I just wish they'd show more of them.

AskReddit,fdxb2f0,t1_fdvovii,1578767052.0,I remember when animal planet was actually educating people about animals and not just 6 different law shows that focus 90% on the humans. It's either that or pitbulls and parolees. I miss steve Irwin and Jeff corwin so much.

EDH,fd3gpkt,t3_ejtook,1578158197.0,"[[Surrak, the hunt caller]] everyone laughs at me for playing the ""bad"" surrak right up until I'm slinging [[ghalta]] in or giving himself haste after [[hero's blade]] equips. Love him as a green stompy leader."
wholesomememes,fcz6g7l,t1_fcz0n10,1578094629.0,Oh boy. It seems I may have some more research/talking with my doctor to do Haha. The k you for taking time out of your day to find that for me :)
deadbydaylight,fcyjmvf,t1_fcyjdpa,1578081177.0,They're all magnificently terrible
deadbydaylight,fcyec49,t1_fcxmr92,1578078853.0,Strongly agree. The Friday the 13th movies are my least favorite of that era of horror.
wholesomememes,fcxn71b,t1_fcxlyjv,1578066943.0,I'm not even entirely sure what that means so that probably gives you an answer haha. Can you give me a quick synopsis if you're not too busy?
wholesomememes,fcxkbv7,t1_fcxjnia,1578065031.0,"I may try another time at a point when my life is a little more stable, but I have a young boy to look after and am going back to school soon hopefully and unfortunately most of the meds I tried gave me side effects worse than my symptoms already were. I'm confident in my ability to do things myself because of my great support system but I will ideally find the right meds for myself later so that I can really enjoy all my hard work. Thank you for your words of encouragement. It's always nice to meet more kind souls :)"
wholesomememes,fcxgt8g,t1_fcxavzl,1578062556.0,"I'm in the same boat. I have never known what caused my anxiety/depression which to me just means it's a chemical imbalance. I've tried meds and found that they're not for me, but I would advise seeing a professional if you haven't already. It was a great help, but only once I really started taking it seriously. I hope you find your peace and feel free to DM me anytime you  need to vent :) you're never as alone as your brain makes you feel."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,fcribcu,t3_eiihw5,1577902189.0,Maybe it's just cause I'm watching the show rn but I love One Piece all-might
EDH,fcnak92,t3_ehrkv0,1577807440.0,This slots into basically any [[feldon of the third path]] deck right? It's at least got me thinking of rebuilding mine.
ModernMagic,fcn88xj,t3_ehzkv8,1577805823.0,Would it have killed them to make it a Kraken Tentacle creature token? Either way I actually really like the card design. It's not great but it's fun and flavorful.
EDH,fckdzz6,t3_ehmghj,1577723206.0,This seems like a fun new [[primal surge]] commander
stunfisk,fca1kfn,t3_egt53i,1577561591.0,I've been having some luck with hitmonchan for obstagoon. Stab mach punch with the 4x weakness to fighting has been the only thing fairly reliable for me. But I'm also lower elo.
pokemon,fc6yxa8,t1_fc6knu3,1577493097.0,Or you just make it grass/dragon so you can have a water/ice and fire could have something to break through ice... maybe fighting?
CasualConversation,fbyewbh,t3_ef4f5s,1577215163.0,Working a full 9-5 at the group home. Everything's pretty slow but I'd still rather not be here.
