dogs,fd6ttuu,t3_ejyiyu,1578195627.0,"My alarm goes off at 6am and i turn it off while ignoring it.My dog wakes up though, steps off the bed, stretches out his back then calmly and silently walks to the back door, sits there and yowl like he is on deaths door for 20 seconds. This is my real alarm clock.

When i first adopted him, He  yowled for a few minutes but then i stopped getting up immediately and his length of yowls cut down. After three years we are down from three minute yowls to 20 sec. I see this as winning.

If I don't go to the back door after he's done yowling he walks back to my room, i pat the bed and he jumps up and gets belly rubs till i fall asleep again.(weekends)

If he's come back to my room and actually needs to go potty he whines next to my face and stomps his front paws. Also does let me pet him."

I adopted mine in the US and it was listed under German Shepard mix/mini Schnauzer. They can also be listed under Briard. A new renter in my neighborhood has a white one which she adopted from a stary's litter-all of them listed as German Shepard mix. Only two of the six puppies looking like berger picards though."

But in the future if you do want to let someone learn the recipe or write it down yourself you could weight all the ingredients before you use them and then weight them after to find out the weight of how much is used. Then you could keep adding the ingredient to the measurement device while its on  a scale to find out  how much is used (subtracting out the measurement device of course)"
