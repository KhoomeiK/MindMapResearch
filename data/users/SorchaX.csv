I am so sorry that this is the relationship you ended up with instead of the one you should have. I will never understand why adults cannot accept that there are never TOO MANY parents loving a single child!  Yes your stepson was a kid when his mind was somehow poisoned against you obviously by at least one adult. But at some point our choices become our own and we begin to really think critically about the actions of the adults in our lives.

That starts to happen long before middle adolescence in my experience anyway.

I was so fortunate to have grown up with a stepmom who loved me absolutely, unconditionally. She gave me a role model against my severely abusive actual mother. I was unbelievably devastated by her sudden though not unexpected death (alcoholism started after my stepbrother died during one of his seizures at the age of 21, my stepmom never recovered from the loss) when I was only 15 and the very week I was beginning high school.  I really could have used her support and love at that point in my life. 

But somehow my lucky fool of a dad managed to marry yet another fabulous stepmom for me when I was 20. She has been the absolute rock of my world since we lost that man to cancer 10 years ago.  She doesn't know it, but she's my hero and I adore her beyond words.

That is the relationship I wish everyone could have with their stepparents and I am so fucking sorry you haven't achieved that yet. I know you cannot see it now and maybe it will never come to pass, but as long as there is life in the body there is still hope. My second amazing badass stepmom and I learned that together losing my dad. But we were together. 

Have hope. It doesn't cost you anything and it's worth the slightest potential that things get made right someday."

Bankruptcy,ff3sg40,t3_erf1ya,1579547861.0,"It should state in your filing paperwork. They are usually extremely clear about their intent with regard to tax refunds, but it may vary by state. When I filed I was told that I could keep anything under $3000. If my anticipated refund were to be more than that it would be given in full directly to the Trustee and he would then disperse the amount to me that I was entitled to. 

Doesn't matter when you file your tax return, they will still ask you about last year's and future year's refunds filed or not. Your attorney will have plenty of clear info on this aspect."
