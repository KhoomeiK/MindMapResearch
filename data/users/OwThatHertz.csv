Fair enough.  That explains your acceptance of the lack of warranty.  ;-)

> God only knows why SteelSeries is doing that to you I had put 3 tickets and were answers within minutes and they should probably change the design flaw of their keyboard... 

I can understand if they just suck at efficiency and were too busy or something.  But when they actually *removed* my post... that crosses the line from incompetence to maliciousness.  I don't want to support a company who's clearly ignoring me intentionally rather than just by accident.

> My solution would be switch all key caps other than space bar or like you said carve out the keycap as only one is being an issue...

Other casual reviews on Reddit have indicated that the issue exists on other keys as well, but is the most prevalent on the space bar.  This is probably due to that extra thickness that isn't present on most (all?) other keys.  That said, I found the font to be fairly terrible and I'd prefer an easier to read font.  (See the first, second, third, and fifth images in [this gallery](https://imgur.com/a/0v3gP30).)  Keycaps with a decent font exist in double shot PBT pudding caps but are hard to find.  I found a set once but lost it, and now have to find it again.  ;-)  If I find it I'll try to let you know."
keyboards,ffb9bbl,t1_ffb3sd2,1579755924.0,"> I will be putting HyperX pudding keycaps on it not 100% if I will but I might and I know the issue with those and Apex Pro is that spacebar doesn’t come back up as it’s so heavy compared to OEM caps...and if I get any issue I will switch OEM back on...any other issues which come due to HyperX puddings?

The space bar issue is NOT that the key is too heavy.  The issue is that the RGB LEDs for each key are not made to match Cherry MX's spec.  The LED is housed in a small piece of translucent plastic that sticks up further than Cherry MX housings normally do.  Double-shot PBX keycaps are thicker than ABS - almost 2X as thick, and the HyperX space bar specifically has EXTRA plastic as you get closer to the top of the keycap (see [this photo](https://i.imgur.com/K4uMIM7.jpg) - the red arrow points to the thicker spot), which gets hung up on the part of the LED housing that is larger than spec.  It's not weight that's holding it down; it literally gets hung up on the switch LED housing if you type hard and has to be pulled back up.  This *may* be an easy fix: carve out the keycap where that occurs.  But it may not.  I disliked the font so I'm returning mine and don't want to damage them to find out.  See my HyperX review above for more details on the font issue.  Otherwise, they're quality keycaps.

Regardless of your decision, I wish you luck.  I just don't want to spend $200 on a keyboard that will receive zero support, regardless of whether or not I'll be in a supported country.  Even if you come back, it appears that you'll *still* be out of luck."

I don't think the keyboard is unstable.  I think there's an issue with the per-key RGB LED and surrounding housing that may effect your ability to use third-party keycaps.  If you have no intention of doing so, I see no issue with the keyboard. 

If you're certain you'll get no support in India (I'm not sure this is true), it doesn't really matter which keyboard you get, so long as it's a solid one.  This one appears to be solid.  It just has a design flaw that impacts something it doesn't officially support, though support claims (somewhat incorrectly) that it supports.  If you want decent support, however, SteelSeries does not appear to be the company to choose.

Corsair offers a warranty in India, though I don't know how it works if you buy in the US then travel there.  Corsair's iCUE software has (or had, when I used it) a small impact to latency and FPS, though, so there's that.

Ducky appears to offer support for India according to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianGaming/comments/afu0tk/ducky_one_2_rgb_tkl_mx_brown_switches/).

pens,ff7zg9a,t1_ff6a7dx,1579662056.0,"While I love Meininger, and I definitely recommend them for professional art and design tools and materials, I think it's a stretch to say they have a good selection of fountain pens.  (They do have a VERY good selection of all other pens, however, along with ink, and a decent selection of paper.)  For fountain pens, however, when I was last there, the selection was a single level of a single counter roughly 4 feet wide.

That said, is it worth the trip?  Absolutely.  They have a decent selection for someone looking to get started, and their fountain pen ink selection is the best I've seen in a store that doesn't focus on fountain pens (first time I've seen a local store carry Noodler's, for example), but they had perhaps 2-3 dozen pens *total*, including multiple colors and nib sizes of the same pen.  They also had quite a few notebooks that were fountain pen ink-friendly, though I would say that knowledge in the area of what was safe and what wasn't was somewhat lacking.  Fortunately, customer service was excellent and  they didn't mind letting me do a few tests before I bought paper.  Clairefontaine, a limited (but present!) stock of Tomoe River, and Rhodia were all available.  Rhodia had the most sizes and styles present.  There were a handful of Clairefontaine notebooks and pocket notebooks, and they had 2-3 colors/weights of Tomoe River loose-leaf.

Prices are decent.  I've seen better and worse, but they're solid for a local store and I think I spent roughly the same as I would have on Amazon for a TWSBI Eco.  (They had all nib sizes and quite a few colors, but not all nib sizes in all colors, for example.)  Inks appeared to be roughly the same price as online for the less expensive stuff.  I seem to remember more expensive inks like Jacques Herbin were a little more expensive than online, but I'm not certain.

So yes, if you're in the area, it's definitely worth the trip.  And there's a decent game store, The Wizard's Chest, right next door.  :-)"

I've been unable to get more than an initial response from Steelseries via support ticket after multiple requests for update.  DMs to Steelseries on Reddit go unanswered.  Posted requests for help are [removed by the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/r/steelseries/comments/eroemf/no_response_to_troubleshooting_ticket_for_7_days/) and I'm not the only one.

I wish I had evidence to the contrary, but ghosting customers and deleting requests for help speaks for itself.  I'll be returning the Apex Pro and going with something else.

It's really unfortunate.  SteelSeries, you had a happy customer who was recommending your products.  You showed that customer they didn't matter and have lost an advocate.

Original review follows:

I love it.  It's super smooth, quiet, and well-built.  I love that I can, for example, drop the actuation to around 1mm for most keys (in the primary 60) but leave the Shift key at roughly 3mm to reduce HAving LOts of CAPs at the beginning of capitalized words.  /r/MechanicalKeyboards believes it's of inferior to the build quality of keyboards like Ducky but I respectfully disagree.  It's thin, solid, made of thick plastic with an aluminum veneer.  Unless you're planning to use it as a weapon, I think the build quality as just fine.  And it might even survive a good bash or two against an intruder's head... if the cable was long enough.  ;-)  The keycaps are cheap: 1mm ABS instead of ~1.7mm double shot PBT, but that's pretty normal for stock keycaps.  The font and print are very legible - better than most of the pudding keycaps I've seen, which all use a super-thin, difficult to read font.  This keyboard's font is legible and bright.

When I say quiet, I mean it's quieter *without* silicone O-rings than my previous Corsair K70 and K95 *with* O-rings, and my Corsair keyboards used silver switches (like reds but with 1.2mm actuation) so were already about as quiet as Cherry MX keyboards get.

The OLED display is more of a gimmick than a useful feature, but it's occasionally nice to get previews of Discord messages there.  The USB passthrough is also in a convenient location for the fingerprint scanner this post was about, though that's personal preference and kind of a small use case.

The volume dial was a feature I specifically wanted and it's decent.  It is kind of slow (i.e. the volume is adjusted slower with the same movement than my Corsair keyboards), but this is made up by the dial wrapping around the rear corner so you can spin it more with a single finger movement.  This somewhat alleviates this concern.  The UI is not as clear as it could be in the manual (and is entirely unlabeled on the keyboard) but the volume dial can be pressed to mute, and the button below it can be pressed for play/paused, double-clicked to skip forward, and triple-clicked to skip back.  Thus, there are definitely easy to use media keys but they aren't obvious at first.  Once you get the hang of it, they're very handy.

In general, I think it's a great keyboard that's unnecessarily expensive for what it is... until you consider that hall effect sensors aren't cheap and this thing has 60 of them.  I'd have liked it if they extended past the primary 60 keys, but there isn't really a reason I need them there; it's just a nice to have had item.

**HyperX pudding keycaps review**
---
[Imgur gallery of images referenced in this review](https://imgur.com/a/0v3gP30)

Generally I would recommend these keycaps. The build quality is very solid and they're clearly much better than many stock keycaps. However, this can cause fit issues with SOME keyboards; more on that shortly. The font is terrible, but legible. Light transmission is great for what these keys are supposed to be. (See first and second photos for comparison against stock keycaps on the left, and these keycaps on the right.)

Okay, so there is this ONE style of double shot PBT pudding keycaps that it seems EVERYONE uses. My guess is that they're all manufactured by the same plant in China, then it's sold under different brands. They all have breaks in the letters that are probably supposed to be stylish but just make some characters harder to read or look like they have printing defects. They don't. It's just the font. This font is also literally HALF the size of most stock keycap fonts: 1mm thick vs 1.98mm thick, measured with a caliper. (See 4th photo.) Also, some of the 10-key keycaps have a second row that is mostly illegible (unless using a bright color, like white) because the LEDs for backlit keycaps are at the top, not the middle or bottom. Overall, I'd rate the font choice a 2 out of 10. It's still legible, but much less so than most stock keys. /rant Surprisingly, the print quality of the font is superior to ABS, which I don't think is usually the case for PBT.

The build quality, however, is superb. The keys are roughly 1.7mm thick, as opposed to roughly 1mm thick for my stock ABS keycaps. You can clearly see the build quality difference in my 4th, 5th, and 6th photos. That said, this CAN lead to a fit issue on some keyboards. I have the SteelSeries Apex Pro and while their keycaps are VERY similar to Cherry MX in shape, their LEDs are housed in a small piece of plastic that is taller at the back than Cherry MX, and the HyperX design is such that it becomes even thicker toward the top so the spacebar sticks if pressed too hard. (See 6th photo.) While that is what I'd call a catastrophic failure of a key, the fault is MOSTLY Steelseries, not HyperX. It'd be nice if it wasn't so thick as it's that area that causes the stick, but if SteelSeries had stuck with the standard LED placement it wouldn't be a problem. This is probably solvable by filing down the area around where the LED housing would be on the keycap, but note that it could be an issue, depending on your keyboard's switches.

Overall, these are quality keycaps. Most people with a standard 104-key OEM layout will be fine if they don't dislike the font as much as I do."

Phanteks,ff04wm4,t3_er0cjr,1579465278.0,"I can't speak to the P600s as I don't own it.  My comments are for the Evolv X.

On the one hand, the Evolv X has a fair amount of space between the vertical mount and the glass.  On the other hand, that's a thick card.  Close proximity to glass may cause a breathability issue, which is what Gamers Nexus usually doesn't like about veritcally mounting even though the Evolv X didn't have this problem with most cards before the 20 series game out.

Have you already ordered it?  I'd recommend you consider a hybrid/CLC GPU insead of air-cooled.  It's going to have greater heat capacity and not suffer from the same susceptibility to proximity suffocation that an air-cooled card would.  I've got EVGA's 1080 Ti Hybrid installed and I've never had an issue with thermals while vertically mounted in the Evolv X.

**Side note 1:** You don't need an aftermarket vertical mounting kit for the Evolv X.  Support for vertical mounting is built in; you just need a compatible riser cable.  I recommend the [Phanteks PH-CBRS_PR22](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H7MHHP6/)  It's the one I use and is specifically designed to fit mounts like the one in the Evolv X, and it looks nice as well.  Note that it's the 220mm version, not the 600mm version, so it'll need to pass in front of the motherboard without a ton of length for wrapping around things.  Thus, it's fine for the primary motherboard but is too short to use with a ceiling-mounted second system, in case that's relevant to you.  (The Evolv X supports 2 motherboards simultaneously.)  I have experienced no issues with performance issue when using this cable, other than issues that were software-related.  (Oculus, *please* let us downgrade from your forced, buggy v12 update!)

**Side note 2:** My system is cooled using 7 Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM fans: 3 for front intake, 3 for the CPU radiator in the ceiling, and one that replaced my hybrid GPU's radiator fan.  Noctua makes great fans and this has had an impact on my system.  I'd recommend considering them for additional cooling capacity, and simultaneous noise drops.  They aren't cheap, but they DO make a difference in temps, noise, and associated performance.  Every little bit helps.

**Side note 3:** Regarding brands, I have seen FAR more complaints about Gigabyte's RMA/customer service process than EVGA's, and EVGA offers 24/7 technical support.  I've never had an issue with their RMA process (other than not getting a return label from them once), and I've even had their reps follow up with me to let me know of a BIOS update that solved a problem with third party hardware that was something I'd consider out of scope for normal support.  EVGA's offering isn't much more expensive than Gigabytes, and solves a cooling issue you might face.  I'd definitely recommend it over Gigabyte, for multiple reasons."

Noctua,fexcgwu,t1_fexabgl,1579428621.0,"> Ahh gotcha. I got confused. You control the speed/rgb from your mobo software?

In a manner of speaking.  While the BIOS could be called the motherboard's software, I'm only controlling some of the fans from there.  Others are controlled by other devices.  The speed of the fans on my AIO (All In One cooler that's cooling my CPU) are controlled by that AIO, and change based on my CPU's temperatures, whereas some of my case fans are just set to whatever I want them to be (usually 65-75% to reduce noise), and the GPU's hybrid/radiator fan is set to 100% as per EVGA's spec.  Those fans (case and GPU) are controlled in the BIOS, but the AIO is controlled by the CPU's fan controller.  I could control this in the AIO's software if I had it installed, but I don't because CAM is a beast on resources and bandwidth, and has horrible data privacy.  (i.e. a complete lack of it.)"
Noctua,fex8w3a,t1_fex4fta,1579427005.0,"> Thanks for the detailed response! Amazing that you have every fan including the gpu fans noctua branded (awesome)

They use a standard connection type; the only tricky part was getting the specs of the GPU, as their connecter was DC instead of PWM, which makes sense since its speed doesn't vary.  (It's always 100%.)  So I just plugged it into the motherboard and set the speed to 100% in the BIOS for that fan header.

> So in summary if I have understood; i could connect all my case fans to the front io (actually planning to get p500A when it comes out in march) and control fan speeds/rgb from a press of a button?

Not front I/O.  Front I/O means your case's front USB, mic/headphone, etc.  I connected them to fan headers on the motherboard.  Each motherboard has a number of fan headers labeled something like CPU_FAN, SYS_FAN, CHA_FAN, etc.  CPU_FAN means the fans connected to the CPU, which is usually where you'd connect a CPU cooler fan, CPU AIO fan controller, etc.  SYS_FAN is often for case fans.  You will usually have at least 2 (if not more) case fan headers.  Header means a set of pins where you'd connect the cables hanging off your fans.

> Noise does not necessarily bother me, but those phanteks halos really are swaying me towards the beige fans instead of black. You have done a good job making them pretty

Thanks, but it's really the Phanteks case that does that.  The colors are just one of the stock settings that came with the case.  My motherboard is the [EVGA X299 Dark](https://www.evga.com/articles/01168/evga-x299-dark/) which, while an excellent motherboard, has zero control over RGB LEDs.  So I plugged all of my RGB devices into my case's controller via daisy-chaining with a little bit of custom cabling for the Corsair LED strips so I didn't have to use Corsair's buggy and performance-impacting iCUE software.

As far as color goes, I'd have preferred black/white (white reflects color much better) to beige, but the best fans weren't available in that color.  Noctua has spent a ridiculous amount of time on material science, and unfortunately the most rigid plastics aren't always possible to manufacture in any color you want.  Rigidity is important because, as the speed increases, the fans can literally stretch out of shape if they aren't rigid enough.  As a result, most fan manufacturers have looser tolerances and larger gaps between fan blades and the fan housing, resulting in pressure leaks and poorer performance at lower RPM.  Noctua solved this by using more rigid (but less aesthetically pleasing) colors.  They're ugly as sin but so rigid that they don't have to leave as much room between the fan and the case, resulting in better performance at low RPM because the fan blades won't change shape due to the centrifugal forces and rub the edges of the housing like other fans made of weaker materials might.  Thus, ugly but well performing or pretty but louder or higher RPM for the same static pressure.  That's why I chose Noctua, then covered the ugly up with the Halo covers.  (In the design industry, that's called ""putting lipstick on the pig."")  The only problem is that the Halos can make for a tighter fit in smaller cases which can impact your build.  I made do but it did mean I had to put the CPU AIO radiator in the ceiling instead of the front of the case so I could take advantage of all of the 3.5"" drives this case can support.  (Up to 10!)  Ah, the sacrifices we make for aesthetics.  Moving the AIO didn't seem to impact performance much, though, so it was worth it.  :-)"

> How are you controlling the fan speeds? Also, would [something like this](https://www.mwave.com.au/product/noctua-140mm-nfa14-pwm-chromaxblackswap-1500rpm-fan-ac10753) work?

You can control the fans in a variety of ways.  My case has a built-in fan hub which allows me to plug multiple fans in and use only a single header from my motherboard, but you can also connect them directly to your motherboard's fan headers since most motherboards have several.  You can then control speeds in the BIOS or software, depending on what your motherboard supports.  You can also plug them into other cooling systems, such as AIOs, and allow either your motherboard or your AIO to control them.  In my case, my motherboard/BIOS controls my case fans and my AIO controls the fans on my radiator.  They're all the same fans, though: the [Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C5VG64V).  I swapped every fan in my system out, including the ones for my AIO and for my hybrid GPU.  The GPU's fan is directly connected to my motherboard and set to 100% in the BIOS since that's what EVGA has their hybrid fans run at, though the Noctua moves more air yet is quieter than the stock fans for everything: the hybrid GPU cooler, the case fans, and the CPU AIO.

As far as the fan you asked about, it's basically an older version of the one I use.  It moves more air but is louder.  According to [this review](https://medium.com/@alexmoore/noctua-nf-a12x25-case-fan-review-a5e4471e0cbc), the NF-A14 PWM moves more air but is louder than the NF-A12x25 PWM as a PWM fan, but moves less air as a static fan.  The NF-A12x25 PWM was specifically designed to perform well as a variable speed fan AND a static pressure fan, whereas I think the NF-A14 PWM was not as well suited for static pressure.  Don't quote me on that, though.

In short, I think either will work but the one you linked will be a little louder when moving the same amount of air.  Whether or not this bothers you depends on how much you care about noise.  I think both are good fans, but I can't say with certainty as I've only used the NF-A12x25 PWM, between the two.  From an aesthetics perspective, the NF-A12x25 PWM is ugly as sin but I opted for performance over aesthetics and covered up the ugly brown with the halos.  (Mostly; the sides are still somewhat visible, depending on room lighting.)

Thus, it's subjective and really depends on your preference of looks, sound, and overall performance.  What's the most important to you?  Go with that."
galaxys10,fewu8v4,t1_fewfaiy,1579419574.0,Thank you for this suggestion.  Very good to know about.
Noctua,fewswx0,t3_eqsn8u,1579419008.0,"I used [Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM fans](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C5VG64V) in [my Phantex Evolv X](https://www.reddit.com/r/Phanteks/comments/c3lfe0/phanteks_evolv_x_rgb_build_with_halos_over/).  They aren't black, but I covered them with [Phantex Digital Halos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BGVD62T) and they look gorgeous.  The fans are super quiet and super-powerful/effective, and the halos make any fan into a daisy-chainable RGB fan.

Note: Get the ""Digital"" variant of the halos if you want full digital control of the RGB.  The non-digital halos are 12V and digital are 5v.  It depends on your motherboard or case, depending on where you're controlling it.  The Evolv X case has 5v digital control built-in, so that's what I used since my motherboard doesn't have the headers."
