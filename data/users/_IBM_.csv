SandersForPresident,ffgqp2b,t3_etg3bz,1579912624.0,"The frustrating thing about this all is that Joe Rogan does not have any radically different values. He's repeatedly been pro-trans people.  He's had trans guests. I'm not a super-fan or anything but I have listened to a few dozen podcasts at least and trans questions have come up several times. He's doing a podcast where the substance is casual conversation and debate, sometimes on edgy subjects, he's not making policy. The issue was never about all trans people and trans rights - it was always one tiny sliver of subject matter within tiny sliver of the population that's trans - like *5 or 6 individuals* that have been the subject matter. That's not a 'class' of people. That's a car load. 

It's been said many times already, but the ""big"" debate is classification in sporting events *where people are already classified by weight and sex* because differences in those factual measurements drastically change the ability for people to compete fairly. The only point that Rogan made that I've ever heard is that being born a man provides the equivalent body development of steroid supplements for decades, and a trans woman fighting against a cis woman in an MMA match is not a fair test of their skills since one of them will have a huge advantage, much like a female fighter fighting a male fighter. 

This isn't about morality or equality... it's basic physiology. Its literally madness to say that the two people being compared are identical when they are physically different *in the context of a physical competition*.  It would be like putting two different weight classes in the same ring for a boxing match because otherwise it would be weightphobic.  **Whether he's right or wrong**, and I don't know or even particularly care, he's debating or sharing an opinion in good faith as an expert on the subject of MMA fighting, and as such he's contributing to the conversation. The atrocious name calling over this is really disheartening. 

There are other complaints against Rogan but this ""transphobia"" issue in particular one seemed to dominate the twitterstorm...  So much so, and so self-defeatingly, it made me wonder if this was one of those russian bot campaigns where fake account spout crazy radical bullshit just to fuck up the entire conversation."
