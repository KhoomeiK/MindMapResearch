RocketLeague,ffq3s28,t1_ffmcbyz,1580118849.0,V-sync locks your framerate to your monitors Hz rating. For example. If you have only a 60hz monitor and you try to run it at a higher framerate (120fps) you can cause screen tearing abs maybe some ghosting. V-sync will now lock your framerate at 60fps. In other words don't try to go above your monitors framerate and you should be fine.

flashlight,fejmt92,t1_fej0w1k,1579180171.0,"I just bought this light from sky lumen with an xhp50 4000k. At first, I hated the color. I'm a 5000k guy. It seems so yellow. As I continued to use it the color accuracy is on point and it has high cri. Doesn't seem as bright but I like it.

I will also say the feel of Ti vs aluminum is amazing. Where it is clipped in my pocket it stays there because the Ti has a rougher feel and more grip to me at least."

AskReddit,fc5ew04,t3_efvlbd,1577455554.0,"My job asked me to go on site a handful of times. They asked me to go full time but now that I own a house and have cats I can't. There were good and bad aspects of it. Here's my list.

**The good**
* everything is expensed. Travel, food, even things like toothpaste or shampoo. Best part is they told me to keep it under 100 a day so I could literally go to a steakhouse for dinner every night if I wanted. 
* don't have to clean or cook if I don't want to.
* the money is great, especially that I don't have to pay a dime although we would normally pay up front and they would reimburse so I get all the credit card points.

**The bad**
* I hate airports; travel in general
* when I worked the overnight shift I'd be sleeping when they want to clean your room. They always eventually tell me to leave the room so they can clean.
* when my company works on site they make us work 12 consecutive hours every day of the week. My last time was a month's duration. So that was 31 consecutive days of 12 hours, each day. It's fucking hell.

That's the main reason I didn't want to do this full time. It's 10 months of working 12 hours a day, every day. TBH though I should have done this for a year my first year. With the overtime I'd probably make upwards of 200k in one year."
