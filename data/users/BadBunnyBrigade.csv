insanepeoplefacebook,ffe2gw5,t1_ffdvq8e,1579834970.0,"I'm not confusing anything. You're arguing my point for me. I never said children couldn't consent because of legal reasons, either. When most people say children can't consent, they're talking about the discrepancy in power between an adult and a child. We know that children recognize adults are in a position of authority over them by default simply because they're adults and that this can and is exploited.

As far as the prison comment I made, reread what I wrote:

>This is why prison inmate can't consent to having sex with prison guards, ***even if they wanted to***.

I already made it clear that ***even if they wanted to***, their consent can't be legally acknowledged because of their position. There's no way to prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, that a prisoner consents of their own free will to having sex with a prison guard, a person who has authority over them. That doesn't mean they're not capable, it means we don't recognize it because we can't prove it wasn't coerced. The prison guard can say it was consensual, the prisoner can say it was consensual, but there's no way we can objectively prove it. So we simply refuse to recognize any and all sexual consent between a guard (or any member of prison staff, for that matter) and a prisoner in order to protect all parties involved.

It's **because** prison guards and staff are in a position of authority (power) over prisoners.

**Also, Mary never consented. She was never in a position where she was ever able to refuse. When your only choices are ""obey"" or ""die/burn in hell"", it's not a choice. It's rape. End of.**"

So while your dog might seem healthy and happy, there are hundreds that are miserable and have no choice in the matter.

Fact of the matter is that your dog exists at the expense of other dog's well being and health. He was created because the parents were chosen of the smallest of the littler, whose parents are chosen of the smallest of the litter, and most of the time they're inbred.

And these are just some of the English ones. I don't know what they bundle with their install files on these other websites. But imagine the garbage they bundle with their install files on Nox third party websites that aren't English... Like Chinese, or Russian or Spanish, Portuguese, etc.

What they get in their search results depends on their search history, region and search engine. You can't guarantee that every person who has made a complaint got their Nox install file from the official website, nor can you guarantee that they didn't get their malware from some other source. Can you? Because I sure as fuck can't. Sounds more like people who download cracked games and then cry that they got a trojan because they don't understand how shit works.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'll concede if and when I see actual evidence that all the garbage people are saying they're getting on their computers is demonstrably from the install file they got from the actual, legitimate Nox website. Yes, they might have gotten their garbage from *Nox*, but was it Nox from the actual official website or some trash third party website?

There's not a single post of an employee stating they included malware.

You have the option of opting out of it installing. I would only agree that it's malware if it was being installed without your consent/knowledge.

If that were the case, why would Nox include them in their install file? They're already pretty popular and rival BlueStacks. That'd be brand suicide. What would they gain from it? Also, they give you the option to opt out. If they really wanted to be malicious, they'd include it in their install but without any notification or ability to opt out of installing.

The reason for this argument is in comparison to other substances that are legal, but have short and long term harmful affects:

* [Tobacco](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm)
* Alcohol
   * [One.](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/alcohol.htm)
   * [Two.](https://www.cdc.gov/workplacehealthpromotion/health-strategies/substance-misuse/index.html)
   * [Three.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/alcohol-use.html)
* Sugar & Caffeine
* Over the counter drugs
* Prescription drugs

All substances, when used in excess, can cause harm and even be fatal. But when used moderately and in the manner intended, their harmful affects can be mitigated. There's also the beneficial affects, which are being properly researched now. Mind you, you shouldn't believe all the overhyped bullshit about cannabis either. It doesn't cure cancer or other diseases, it's not some miracle drug and no, we absolutely should not be making it legal for minors to use recreationally (there's a group on YouTube that advocates we should remove age requirements).

The only reason why it was ever made illegal is because the political extreme were using it as a justification for [xenophobic propaganda](https://www.history.com/news/why-the-u-s-made-marijuana-illegal). It was a crutch. They used this fear and began the ""[Reefer Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhQlcMHhF3w)"" and their war on drugs. These were targeted towards the middle and lower classes, especially the working classes, that might not have had as much education in science, and exploited their ignorance. The way they created their propaganda was to instill fear in families rather than be educational in any sense of the word.

Now that we know better, we can research it as well as the benefits of psilocybin, the active chemical found in magic mushrooms. It's not an exaggeration when people say that they've felt more stable, happy and generally had a sense of well being after dosing psilocybin, even months after. I've personally experienced is myself.

The other reason why it was kept illegal for a long time is because of market monopoly. Big pharma (I cringe using this term but for lack of a better one, for now) will and are going to lose a lot of money if and when legalizing becomes federal. When you compare the harmful side effects of prolonged use of pharma antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications with the side effects of cannabis, it's not difficult to see that cannabis has been, is and will be the lesser evil, so to speak. Yes, there obviously are side effects to prolonged and excessive use of cannabis, but these symptoms don't present in everyone, aren't fatal on their own and are much less likely to produce a dependency. Or at least, not a harmful one.

So, why should we legalize it? Because I'd much rather see people smoke weed instead of tobacco, or drinking themselves into a blackout. I'm much less concerned about people driving while high (and no, there hasn't been some sudden surge of accidents and/or deaths caused by people who drive while high on weed, it's propaganda) than I am about people who drive while drunk.

Also, I want more research done on these drugs and not just cannabis or mushrooms, but on LSD and other drugs as well. We could research ways to see if they could be of some use, or to create treatments (such as vaccines) so that they can no longer affect us.

My subjective reasons for legalizing: If people want to use, let them. I don't see any moral, ethical or medical reason why we can't.

My objective reasons for legalizing: Research. Science. Medicine. Knowledge.

Showerthoughts,feywiu1,t3_eqw0uq,1579451385.0,"I'm not sure what you mean by prevalent. Are you saying that mental illness is a recent thing? Or that there are more mentally ill people now than before?

I'd argue that both statements are false. The only difference between then and now is our ability to recognize, diagnose and treat mental illness. It would be like saying no one died from influenza thousands of years ago because there are no records of it. There are records of it, but we didn't recognize it as an influenza, how it worked, spread, evolved, etc., until modern medicine.

There absolutely was mental illness before the industrial age. A lot of it, in fact and not only that, many used religion and the occult to justify their beliefs. Began hallucinating? Obviously the witch down the road summoned demons to possess you. Beat your wife and kids one day, but you're the kindest and most reasonable person the next day? That's alright, you're probably just touched by the devil. If you were rich, you were probably just eccentric or a ""man"". Tortured hundreds of young women (something like 600+ if I remember right) because you're bored, you're curious about anatomy and biology, and you're a psychopath? Well, you're the Countess Bathory, who bathed in the blood of her victims so she could steal their youth.

And on the subject of religion and cults, we had people who were very ill mentally and formed religious/cultish beliefs based on their hallucinations. For example, if Jesus had really existed and we could bring him forward into our present time, we'd have him committed to a mental health hospital because he'd have been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. So would have many other people. Many religious scriptures are based off of the rantings and ravings of lunatics. Even now people still believe these things.

The fact of the matter is that there was just as much mental health issues back then, if not more. Now, we can recognize and treat them. The evolution of modern medicine is what saved us. We should be grateful for the ones that made it possible."

""I wish I was anywhere but here right now.""

""I wish I could fly.""

""Granted. You're a mosquito now. Depending on your prior biological sex, if you were male you have about 10 days to live, and maybe two months if you were female. If you're lucky. Enjoy.""

That's slowly going away. Not as quickly as we'd like but many schools are prioritizing healthy eating and dieting, rather than starvation. This is especially true now that more information comes out about bone health and density, as well as muscle health and strength being linked to diets. Having strong bones that won't break or fracture so easily is really important for dancers, as well as healthy muscles that won't deteriorate.

Unfortunately it's not enough schools that are prioritizing healthier dieting and weight management, but there are popular primas that are refusing to go that route and are actually encouraging the more athletic side of ballet. [Misty Copeland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWJ5_HiKhNg) is a popular one. People kept telling her to lose weight, so instead she decides to strengthen her muscles and body. She's a prima but looks like an athlete.

Honestly, I wish more dancers would take her cue. Being stronger and healthier means she'll be able to dance for longer in her life, she's less likely to be injured and she'll be able to do things other primas can't because their bodies can't take the strain. People see the pretty side of ballet but don't see the injuries female dancers get during performances or training. The broken bones, fractures, pulled muscles, injuries to tendons and ligaments, the stress it puts on their joints. Not eating properly means weaker bones and weaker bones break easier.

Having more dancers like Copeland raises the bar for dancers. The only problem is the old guard that are still fixated on how a prima should look. So a lot of professional dancers are telling the *weight watchers* to fuck off. With cheer leading being recognized as a sport and more ballet dancers promoting the athleticism of ballet, we might see ballet being recognized as a sport as well. Gymnastics are a form of art but they're also a sport. There's a lot of similarity.

TL;DR: That stereotype/old way of thinking is slowly fucking off as ballet is becoming more athletic and more professional ballet dancers are being recognized as athletes. Google Misty Copeland."

That's why many of them have a pop-up that appears during installing asking you to uninstall any other antivirus program you have on your PC as they may interfere with one another.

Sit inside that locked crate for as long as you keep her in there, for four days in a row, and tell me how you feel after. What your dog is beginning to experience is something called [Cabin Fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_fever). It might have seemed ok at first, but not every dog is able to be conditioned into accepting their prison and yes, it absolutely is a prison. Dogs can develop depression, anxiety, aggression, withdrawals as well as the inability to feel secure in their own homes. Your dog has already begun acting out. Crating is conditioning, not training. 

Your dog is unable to move, stretch, explore, feel secure or interact with her environment. It's not her home, it's your home that she happens to exist in. You've prioritized your needs and material objects over her well being as an animal. If you're unprepared for this particular breed, size or animal, then perhaps you should consider having an animal that can better suit your living conditions and needs. But just like having children in your home, if you choose to have a particular kind of animal or breed, there may be some compromises you'll need to figure out.

If there are objects she can chew and choke on or that will poison her/make her sick, these items will need to be put out of reach. If there are items she can knock over and break, and perhaps hurt herself, these items will need to be put out of reach. Items that are valuable will need to be secured. Under counter cupboard doors may need to be child proofed for your specific dog. You may need to ask a third party to come in and help you train your dog so that she can feel secure in her home (her home, not just yours) so that her behavior isn't destructive.

If you're unable to properly care for your dog without crating her, then you should consider looking for a family that can. You're asking for advice so you should expect that sometimes, the advice you're going to receive isn't necessarily one you want to hear: Stop conditioning. Begin training. Or rehome."

Advice,fenrh6a,t3_eq34ax,1579289707.0,"Crating dogs is not normal, or healthy, or acceptable. The only times an animal should be crated is for transportation, the safety of others or for medical reasons.

Instead of teaching your dog how to behave properly inside your home while you're away, you're relying on your dog not going stir crazy for 7+ hours in a box. Train your dog not to chew things rather than caging her. If there's a fire in your home, your dog has no way to escape. Not only that, if your dog is panicking, the likelihood that firefighters will be able to help her decreases significantly.

If you're unable to train your dog to behave better, or don't have the means to pay someone else to do so, the best thing you can do for her (not you), is to have someone else adopt her who can. Keeping her crated for hours a day is terrible. Please think about her well being."

noxappplayer,femz77i,t1_femnk6w,1579273340.0,"Nox doesn't have viruses, at least not the actual official version anyhow. I think a lot of people who are complaining got their Nox install from some unofficial, unsupported third party website that looks like Nox, but it's a dupe. Those websites have taken the Nox install file and pretty much put whatever they want in it, including malware and other garbage that might have been installed in the background without the user knowing, then blame Nox official for their own carelessness.

The other probably reason why people are saying ""virus!"" is because of the third party software that was included. It may not actually be a virus but your anti-virus will flag it as a virus, especially if it's another anti-virus program. For example, Nox included an anti-virus program that users could opt in/out of installing. Some users are careless and don't pay attention during installation, so they don't click on Reject/Deny/Refuse and the software gets installed. They end up installing the anti-virus software that their own anti-virus program flags as a virus because they don't want you installing a competing software that might steal you as a customer. The ""virus"" is a false positive, meaning your anti-virus was programmed to flag other competing anti-virus software, even mainstream ones, because they bank on the idea that their users are too stupid/ignorant to realize what's happening. This is how they make their money. But also, if they're using cracked games/apps, their anti-virus will probably scan them and tell them it's a ""trojan"" because of how the game was cracked. It's another false positive.

The other probability is that the ""viruses"" they say they keep getting are coming from whatever other ""*activities*"". Users that go on porn sites, torrent/P2P sites, that are downloading pirated software/games, etc., are more likely to have been getting viruses from these than they are from Nox.

I've been using Nox since around 2015 and I've never had an issue with it other than the odd bug/glitch. I've never had a ""virus"" or third party software installed without my knowing. In fact, I had been using Bluestacks for a while first, but when I saw people talking about Nox, I tried it and I've never gone back to Bluestacks. So honestly, it sounds more like people are just being careless and blaming Nox for it.

If you don't install the third party software that comes with it (that I think Nox is saying they're going to remove now?) then there shouldn't be any issue beyond the bugs/glitches, etc."

Sooo... what then? Should you be spending that time doing something else in that case? Then wouldn't you be spending more time doing that new thing than video games? People have hobbies and will spend a lot of time doing those hobbies. I fail to see the difference. But also, you're only playing on the weekends and only for a few hours each. That's not what an addiction is. If you were really addicted, you'd be playing every single day, non stop, and not take care of yourself, your grades, family or friends, etc.

As some people are saying, it's only an issue if it interferes in your daily life; eating/drinking, self care/hygiene/medical issues, rest/sleep, work/school, family/pets and socializing. If you're still taking care of yourself, doing your work, still keeping up with friends and it's only on the weekends, that doesn't sound unhealthy at all, but rather the opposite.

In fact, when you enter university, obviously you won't be able to keep up with your ten hour play time, but you should still at least put in an hour or so on the weekends when you can. It's a healthy distraction and helps people relax, do something fun and to vent some frustrations.

AskReddit,feemisg,t1_feefs06,1579036768.0,">""Hold in your hand"" is a common phrase that has a specific meaning

No, actually, it doesn't have a specific, singular meaning.

I've already explained that ""holding something in my hand"" (and posted examples) can be interpreted as holding something with a gripped hand and holding something in your palm with an open hand. The fact that ""holding something in my hand"" can be interpreted differently, means that if the contracting party doesn't define ""hold in my hand"" to mean only one or the other definition, and there's no reasonable expectation of a singular definition , then the contracted party is free to interpret the terms within reason.

Meaning, (again) because OP didn't define ""hold... in your hand... forever"" as something that requires you to have an object that your hand constantly grips to and the fact that other people can reasonably interpret ""hold... in your hand"" as something that rests upon their palm with an open hand, means that both interpretations qualify.

I'm not even separating the words this time, I'm responding to your ""hold in your hand"" sentence and my interpretation still applies. Yours applies as well, I never said it didn't.

AskReddit,feeaiym,t1_fee7xax,1579029772.0,">The third example is invalid and again separates ""hold"" and ""in your hand"" as two separate ideas

Again, that's because you're assuming that to ""hold"" something ""in your hand"" can only be done in one manner, that is by gripping an object. You don't have to grip something in order for it to be considered something that you're holding. I can hold something on my palm with an open hand. So yes, it can be separated since ""hold"" has multiple meanings. If ""hold"" only had one, clear definition than I would agree with you that to ""hold"" something ""in your hand"" can only mean one thing.

Nuance."
AskReddit,fee4x7c,t1_fee22kc,1579026469.0,">You are conveniently separating ""hold"" and ""in your hand"" as if they are two separate statements

Because you keep forgetting that to ""hold something in your hand"" doesn't necessarily mean you require closing your hand around an object. To hold something in your hand can also mean to support something. 

[Holding water in your hand](https://paysonutah.org/storage/2016/05/63-1.jpg). As you can see, the hands aren't encapsulating the water. The water is clearly being supporting in the palms of two open hands.

[This person is holding a bird in their hand](https://c.stocksy.com/a/DzA000/z9/42235.jpg?1574235144). Again, the hand isn't gripped around the bird, but is being supported on the palm of an open hand.

It literally fits everything. OP never specifies that the ""something"" has to be 3D object. It clearly says 1) ""something of your choice"" has to be 2) ""in your hand"" so you can 3) ""hold"" 4) ""forever"".

I'm not saying other definitions (like yours) doesn't qualify, I'm saying that since OP didn't specify, you can interpret it as four different terms of a single agreement:

1. Hold (action)
2. Something of your choice (subject)
3. In your hand (location, party, singular)
4. Forever (duration)

Semantics."
AskReddit,fedzhc9,t1_fedwklr,1579023155.0,"You're right, we can all read the title just fine. But that doesn't change the fact that ""*hold*"" and ""in your hand"" don't have to be defined exactly as is because they can have multiple meanings. This is why certain terms are defined properly in contracts, bills, policies, laws, etc.

I'd like to retract my earlier comment. OP never used the word ""holding"", he/she specifically used the word ""*hold*"".

""[*Hold*](https://i.imgur.com/aC6pi7e.png)"" - 

Section 1:

1. grasp, carry, or support with one's arms or hands. 
   1.  be able to bear (the weight of a person or thing). 

Section 5:

1. have in one's possession.

The definition for ""*hold*"" satisfies both the agreement for ""*hold""* and ""*in your hand*"".

Having the words ""*something of your choice*"" tattooed on my palm qualifies as being something I ""*hold*"" since the word ""*hold*"" can also mean something you support as well as something that's in your possession. The fact that it's on my palm satisfies that it's ""*in my hand*"". The permanence of the tattoo satisfies the agreement for ""*forever*"".

In any case, I think u/blurfquarf owes me a billion dollars. Since he/she wrote it out in text form, rather than in a numerical monetary form ($1, 000, 000, 000), I expect I'll literally be getting one billion dollar bills."
