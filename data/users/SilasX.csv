Remember, Yoda apparently *burned a bunch of books*. That's ... pretty significant. We're basically seeing Yoda do something symbolically fascist. That's a huge blow to the theme of SW!  So, yeah, it's pretty important that they refute it!  And yet, if you miss the book reveal, or the books' initial appearance, or just forget about them, you'll miss the unringing of a pretty important bell.

And then the dice: This is Luke taking up precious time to give something to Leia in a grand gesture. It's a giant WTF if you don't know their significance before that point. And so *if* they're as significant as the writer them to be taken as, then it needs to be set up.

I'm sure some movies can go overboard about foreshadowing something.  But for the above things, they need to be sprinkled in enough that you won't miss it if you're away from ten seconds; it needs be part of the ""ground"" that the film sits on top of and something easily recognizable.

Right -- not a slob, just not grown up. I think you missed the point of the slob reference, which was to refute your confused claim that it's somehow ""grown up"" not to care if you look like a slob, and refute your general point that it's ""grown up"" not to care what others thing, and is a rule you can't possibly take seriously, but only voice to sound independent.

Since you should care what others think on *some* level, it follows that you should care that your room looks kiddie. I'd want to know if I were unknowingly doing this to my room, and that is a majestically ""grown up"" thing to care about.

You insist that you're reading my comments, yet this latest one contains a second misrepresentation!

I didn't ""tell OP not to use the quilt"".  I pointed out reasons that people might reasonably be bothered by *that particular use* of the quilt, and suggested *other* ways to use the quilt to honor her memory, and then implored OP to *consider* them.
