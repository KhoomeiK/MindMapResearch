Game development is a very complex machine with a lot going on in it,  you can't just throw artists on QA and expect it to work.  

There is no such thing as a bug free game, and if they halted events for patches (remember, two completely different areas of development) the game would have been dead months ago."

bloodborne,fdla3li,t3_elx9se,1578519662.0,"After you get past the bonfire, keep running straight in the next spot and you'll see some coffins against a fence. You can break through there and have a whole new area to explore.  

There's a set of hunters attire that has much better defense than your starting rags and if you explore enough you'll find a shortcut that leads you right to the cleric beast and the next boss fight.  

For the beast, hang out under the right leg (his left) and keep strafing to the right and you'll duck most of his attacks. Don't lock on because you're going to want the dodge roll for when he does his jumping attack. You should be able to do a lot of damage with the transforming attack on the axe.  

Like everything in this game, it's all practice and pattern learning. You'll get it."

Games,fcuigkw,t1_fcuhw0g,1577981728.0,"It's pretty much a AAA timer based free to play mobile game, in a good way.
