And keeping the house clean is not what it used to be, the old wooden floors required regular scrubbing on your hands and knees, without a vacuum cleaner everything had to be swept up and the carpets had to be taken outside to be dusted. No dishwasher so everything need to be washed manually, additionally no no-stick frying pans etc. so more scrubbing. No washing machine so even more work. Without a fridge daily shopping trips. Making jams, pastries and whatnots at home because many things were not available at shops or prohibitively expansive.

Bang his head on the wall trying to solve problems someone could just give him an answer too (like, say, running out of inodes, once you know it's possible you can check for it but without that knowledge good luck).

But, like, if you're doing the same job that a highschooler after 2 hours of training is doing you can't really complain that others are getting paid more. There are jobs out there that require a bit more effort to start but at least there's a difference in pay after a few years."
