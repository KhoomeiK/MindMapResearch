Nope, lay off half the people, but still run a society where you need green points to get food, shelter and clothes. That means they they need to either start a business or join a business that convinces Americans to buy more shit they don't want. The jobs will have less and less connection to any tangible improvement in society, so you won't even feel good doing them. Because automation is putting more people in your position, the race to bottom continues and you need to accept shittier wages and work conditions. Free time is now the 2 hours where you heat your dinner up in the microwave and check work emails before you go to sleep.

I want someone who is most likely to actually cheer and champion a slowing GDP and stock market with the result of the population getting more sleep, spending more time with their family, etc...

The standard answer on both the right and left in the US to ""I feel insecure about being able to afford housing or food"" is ""scan the market, view yourself as a cog in the machine and try to find the prettiest machine at the moment and reshape your wants, needs, personality, and geographic location to fit best in whatever they need"" or ""find out an area of human activity that hasn't been exploited to maximum efficiency yet and work 100 hours a week until you find a way to maximally exploit it"".

To me Yang seems to still admire the CEOs and all them that do this (""We don't want to attack success, we should celebrate it!"").  And UBI in his views seems to be more of a buffer to give you a bit of comfort before you make one of those two choices.  But Bernie is a little more strong on actively trying to discourage that second option as a pre-requisite for feeling secure (""To hell with Wall Street"").  I think the only way this happens is by fundamentally looking at these CEOs or executives or professionals who have found cracks in the market to exploit, worked 100 hours a week, and saying ""If you want to do this shit, go ahead, but it's beyond unreasonable to expect the average person to walk down this road just to be able to afford a place to live"".

On that topic, I think that every politician and voter who is not willing to codify family time in law [like say the French did in this instance](https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/02/technology/france-office-email-workers-law/index.html) at the expense of GDP and profits cannot claim to be for ""family values"".

It makes these issues something that you're born with and we just have to grin and bear it and go ""Aw Shucks"" when it consumes someone.  For sure this is true for many people.

But what if depression and anxiety are actually real, logical, and natural responses to the stimuli of our world?  What if the biologically human response to being shoved into this world of ultracompetition, dog-eat-dog careers and economy, begging for endorsements on LinkedIn, having to find the latest SEO trend to put on your resume so you get considered for a job like an actual person, people yelling at you to work harder and network more in one ear and people yelling at you to spend time with your kids and meditate in the other, legitimately existential crises from climate to the nature of an economy that fundamentally changes every 5 years now...what if the normal response to that is the anxiety and depression that so many people feel?  What if the people that seem to rise above are actually the weirdos?

It's glaringly obvious that our social, economic, and political systems do not prioritize the wellbeing of the everyday person.  It's a race to the bottom that we all must run.  Everyone can feel it, and they express it with different words, but it's that same feeling.  For me personally, I'm at a point where unless you support at least research and dialogue and debate about fundamentally changing our system, your hollow words of ""Fuck depression"" or ""Awareness for mental health"" are pretty hollow.

I expect this is what many people saw in Donald Trump, even if they couldn't articulate it well.  I saw that and instinctively thought ""That's exactly why I like Bernie so much"".  What's going on here?  How did the country get to this point, and can we actually start talking about real things we can do to solve this?"

The right doesn't care if the person they elect is rich.  Trump, Romney, Bush.  Part of their appeal is that they are rich.  So let's not pretend you actually care about that.

Then there's the whole hypocrite angle.  How could he have a million dollars while ragging on the taxes they should be paying.  Very similar to ""no one's stopping Warren Buffet and Bill Gates from writing checks to the US Treasury"".  

Guys...we live in a society.  I might not agree with the labor conditions of way the secondhand shirt I pick up was made in but...I need a shirt.  If I make a principled stand and refuse to wear a shirt that was made in conditions I disagree with, I'm not gonna wear a shirt.  Without a shirt, I have no possible way of enacting the change I want to see.  So I'll wear a shirt and rail against the labor conditions that made the shirt.  And people like you will go ""BuT yOu'Re WeArInG a ShIrT!""

If the ""left"" followed all the purity tests that *the right* hoists upon it, we'd be unable to fly, communicate with smartphones, dress, eat without growing it ourselves, drive, broadcast on the internet and lots of other things.  They'd be completely ineffective in getting their message out and enacting actual change (which I suspect is the point of the right trying to nudge them to doing these things).

Bernie Sanders being a millionaire does not bother me in the slightest, and it's a little embarrassing to see the right trying to make a big deal out of it.  He's still very clearly the one most likely to push the thing I want to actually get done.
