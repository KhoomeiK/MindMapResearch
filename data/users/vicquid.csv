While it isn't a sweater, I do have a decent amount of hair (kinda like the silver hair of a silverback). She gobbed wax on the whole area, put the removal cloth on too, and let it set up. 

If she hadn't done my whole back with wax already, I would have been out and just had one patch missing; but I was in for the long haul ladies and gentlemen. Her kids laughed the whole time while she ripped the skin and hair off,  causing blood to bead up on my back.
