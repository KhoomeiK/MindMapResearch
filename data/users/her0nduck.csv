gradadmissions,ffri0zq,t3_eupfr4,1580158404.0,Duke did this for poli sci PhDs this year. I had already submitted. Kinda pissed me off.
mildlyinteresting,ffpjnif,t3_eufixc,1580096652.0,Is this at Suncadia in Washington? My husband and I were just there and had some baby Yoda cocktails at the Inn just like them!
AskReddit,ffpjjgd,t3_euh9qj,1580096567.0,"Political science student here (going to grad school in fall)...turn the whole thing into a glass parking lot. I don’t think the world system as it is can be peaceful under a non-hegemonic system. 

Personally, I think it’d be cool if an international congress like the UN but with teeth was the ultimate authority for transnational disputes, but realistically we’ll never achieve long lasting peace under the current international political system."
GradSchool,ffpgpln,t3_eubgqz,1580094620.0,Post this on r/gradadmissions! Everyone over here is exactly in the same spot...come commiserate with us!
AskReddit,ffpg7h3,t3_eucp3f,1580094264.0,"High school Calc teacher HATED me because he knew my dad professionally (math prof at a local university) and didn’t like him. Made my life hell, singled me out on doing board work we hadn’t covered and would get the whole class to laugh at me when I couldn’t do it (since, ya know, I hadn’t been taught), and artificially deflated my grade in his class. I had him for two years. Since Calc II was the highest math class at my high school, there were only 12-13 of us in it. Last day of senior year, he asks what we want to do in college. 

When he gets to me, I say I want to go into political methodology, which is basically statistics for poli sci. He laughs and tells me I’ll never pass a college math course and there’s no point in trying. I’m graduating in May with a 3.92 GPA and ended up with a triple major—one of which is math, and will be going for a PhD in political methodology in the fall. And what do I do for a living, you might ask? Tutor math from K-12 up to undergrad. Funny how I can do math if I’m given the opportunity to learn. 

You bet my petty ass is photo scanning my degree and transcripts and sending them to him along with a copy of my honors thesis."
college,ffj1px5,t1_ffizocd,1579988186.0,Thanks! Best of luck to you in your college endeavors!
college,ffiv1ho,t3_etl7w2,1579983414.0,"I’m a triple major (math, political science, and Spanish) graduating in May with a 3.92. I also work 2 jobs (total of 30-35 hours a week), edit for a national journal, am married, do research, and am starting grad school (political science PhD) in the fall.  It’s completely doable...it all comes down to time management. I did have to sacrifice a lot of my social life and be VERY strict with my time (I think if I lost my color coded planner I would spontaneously combust), but for me to get into a top PhD program in my field, sacrificing for four years was necessary and completely worth it. I haven’t had a traditionally “fun” college experience, but I’ve loved it, and am proud of everything I have been able to do. 

My dad died two years ago, and a lot of my motivation to stick to it comes from wanting to make him proud. He was a statistician and always really believed in me and my academic career, as he had a PhD himself. It’s well within the realm of possibility, but you have to ask yourself if the trade off is worth it to you. Grades aren’t everything, but they were a necessity evil for me."
