Trump is going to say anything he can to get voted in again and that's going to involve a bunch of lying but it works! It really works. Especially for those voters whose emotions are easily manipulated by conjecture.

Sanders is not going to play that game. He's going to say the cold, hard facts and it's going to turn off a bunch of fence-sitters. They don't know the difference between truth and lie and will eat up anything Trump says because, yes, it sounds better.

Then I started wearing a monitor and, though maybe not *exactly* accurate, but I was doing high intensity hour long workouts and burning **at most** 800 calories. Then I ran a couple of half marathons and saw I was burning around 1,100 calories. That's easily a drive through burger, coke, and fries. I've never been able to wrap my head around those people that do that calorie-in-calorie-out diet where they ""burn more calories than they put in"" especially when the average person probably burns 500 - 700 calories in a full hour workout but there's no *way* they can have the energy for a full hour workout if eating less than that a day. I just don't understand that philosophy.

We were measured in what's called conversions. Everyone on the team's goal was 8 conversions a month and by the end of my tenure, my goal was 30 monthly. So if I made 31 conversions, I made less than someone who made 10. That lasted just long enough for me to finish interviewing at their competitor with which I accepted the job and took 4 of their top 20 clients with me.
