gaming,ffchcgw,t1_ffcahcw,1579799478.0, I'm sorry you feel that way
modernwarfare,ffc2l4k,t1_ffanjxt,1579789964.0,"I bought it, just because you can't imagine spending money on a ""broken"" game doesn't mean everyone else feels the same. I love the game, I play with my little brother and we have a blast. Spending $10, $20, $40 every once in a while on cool  looking skins for us doesn't affect me, we fully enjoy the game and are thankful to the devs for said enjoyment."
modernwarfare,ffc1jrv,t1_ffakaj5,1579789193.0,"Seriously, I got immense buyer's remorse after buying the bundle so I wouldn't have to wait to unlock the bow. It is completely useless when it comes to killing enemies, you might get one person but good luck reloading before dying to his buddy or literally anyone else that sees you in the next 5 seconds"
modernwarfare,ffbby4u,t1_ff9fwzp,1579759025.0,"Anything else, boss?"
OldSchoolCool,ffbbal4,t1_ffb5ri2,1579758333.0,This made me laugh more than it had any reason to.

gaming,ffavwkg,t1_ffaurt4,1579745714.0,"If you genuinely found his annoying overused reply funny, then consider me impressed you would know what ""simpleton"" means. Good on you."

modernwarfare,ffapftm,t1_ffanvtj,1579741404.0,tell her not to save the people that post that kind of crap. Just not worth the effort
modernwarfare,ffao544,t1_ffagufd,1579740532.0,"They do, I tried to take a screenshot of the warning but the app didn't let me because of ""security reasons"". $10 extra for every 50gb you go over 1TB"
modernwarfare,ffao0sh,t1_ffa7oqg,1579740451.0,"Xfinity here too, they cap my shit at 1TB/mo with a $10 fee for every 50 gb. I pay for top of the line everything but they still wanna squeeze out more. Such bullshit, they know there are no other providers in my area so they can get away with it. Houston by the way."
modernwarfare,ffange6,t1_ffahz1c,1579740068.0,What is this type of cancer
modernwarfare,ffamtcy,t1_ff9eql6,1579739636.0,"I love how you can easily tell the angle wouldn't make sense for the semtex to land where op spawned but you still double and even triple down on your dumb argument lol. Sometimes you just need to admit you were wrong. Watch the kill cam, semtex don't bounce, they stick where they hit, even if the angles were right, it wouldn't have bounced on anything to land on op. The game is just buggy and kept the semtex stuck to op even after respawn."
modernwarfare,ffa574j,t1_ff9o20l,1579728110.0,"Are you retarded? You guys started pestering him about buying a key like he can't make his own decisions, he has every right to be a dick about it to you dicks telling him what to do when this post isn't even about that."
modernwarfare,ff9qelr,t1_ff8msso,1579718671.0,"Shhh don't tell them how much we're willing to pay or they'll make sure to get every penny. 

IW I'm willing to pay no more than $10 for this...

gtaonline,ff9ch2l,t1_ff8h9x9,1579709864.0,"Thats a name I haven't heard in a while. I used to follow him back when he was still small, before he turned wannabe rapper and all that. His shit was really enjoyable but then started getting bigger and blander."

AskReddit,ff4nxtv,t1_ff44jh0,1579568217.0,"See taco bell does nothing to me either, but I drink some coffee and oh boy, my insides turn liquid in record time. My coworkers used to always ask if I wanted to go get coffee with them, always turned them down, they kept asking every day then asked if I didn't like it, I just said ""it's not that I don't like it, but if I drink coffee I'm gonna be shitting more than working."" They stopped asking after that."
gtaonline,ff4mnyx,t1_ff39i0m,1579567318.0,"Back when GTA released we used to be able to get our strength up by getting on top of an NPC truck and just kick and kick while they drove around until we had what we needed, don't know if that still works today."
modernwarfare,ff38prb,t1_ff34dal,1579536337.0,"You literally see exactly what he did in the kill cam. He cooked a grenade and didn't let go, got super lucky and took op with him on the explosion."
popping,ff2b8zq,t1_ff1wo72,1579499430.0,"These people are downvoting you because you're pointing out something so obvious, that bullet was not a ricochet. It is too perfectly smooth to have hit any material that would cause it to ricochet. Redditors are so stupid sometimes."

pics,fewh0y1,t1_feuma2t,1579410443.0,He's gonna need the help when customers don't go there anymore because homeless people stay there knowing they are welcome and they'll get fed. Good on the guy for being so caring but damn that's a risky move.
pics,fewgerx,t1_fevub50,1579410150.0,Yeah I was looking for an update on the store. 100% that owner is asking for his little restaurant to be a hobo hub. The sign will not be up there too long if he appreciates paying customers.
