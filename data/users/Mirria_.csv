- treat specific limb to stop bleeding or fix fracture. Heal each bodypart separately.
- fractured leg makes you move at crawl speed unless you take painkillers
- running on broken legs while on painkillers cause continuous but slow damage
- fractured arm makes your weapon sway heavily and drain stamina very quick while ADS
- taking 100% damage to a limb makes it black and unable to heal it, and acts like it was broken. It can stil be fractured or bleeding (bleeding causes hp damage to all body parts)
- blacked out stomach causes severe energy and hydration loss
- you can fix blacked out limbs but it takes a special item (surgery kit) and it takes ~15sec to apply, heals to 1hp and reduces max hp of that limb by half
- 0 hp on head or torso (thorax) is instant death unless it's caused by bleeding. Taking any non-bleeding damage while either are black are 1-hit kill. You cannot use surgery kits on head or torso.
- Painkillers only last ~5minutes. There are various injectors that gives some bonuses (adrenaline for infinite stamina, heal over time, etc) but they have some downsides that trigger on a delay.

Limbs have standard separate hitboxes. Head has top, nape, ears (sides), eyes, jaw and neck (front)."

starcitizen,ff87yxk,t1_ff81mbn,1579668610.0,"Getting the base game released and then patched with new features is how Elite Dangerous has been doing it. And look at how *glacial* the development pace is. Half the underlying ""world building"" features are just patched up placeholders. The dev team is drowning in technical debt. Major features get delayed multiple times, leading to large voids of updates. People question if they're even working on the game. Space legs and atmospheric flight are less ""upcoming"" and more like ""a dream for the future of the game"" with so many questions unanswered. How do you retrofit ships, for example? Do all ships have a fixed interior regardless of how they are configured? How do people move around in their ship when there's no artificial gravity in the lore? How do you navigate on foot around those spinning space stations?

Star Citizen has chosen to do it the hard way - do everything at once right away, and do it right, so that everything clicks together and makes sense. But the spin up is slow, and frustrating even for the most fervent backer. But we wait. Because this isn't ""just a game"" for many of us, it's a combination of everything we've ever wanted.

They're making cake, and they're letting us lick the beaters before they've even figured out the proper recipe."

Look at this, if you tipped the trailer 45 degrees sideways, would the load stay in place? If the answer is no, then it's not safe.

AskReddit,fdne3tu,t1_fdncgk5,1578583848.0,"No, it's the classic tech bubble 

1) make a free, novel website or service that gets people excited 

2) run in the red for a couple years while it grows in relevance 

3) get valued at billions 

4) sanitize your platform 

5) get sold off to a tech giant (optional : original creators retire) 

6) new owner tries to monetize a free service. 

7) most fails horribly. 

3 and 4 can sometimes be swapped. Discord is currently at #4. Reddit is at #6. YouTube is teetering between #6 and #7. Facebook and Google managed to skip failure by maintaining control and *becoming* the tech giants."
