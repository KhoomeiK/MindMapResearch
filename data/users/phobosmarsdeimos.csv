One of the main aspects of using a trade secret over a patent is the likelihood of a competitor from being able to figure out the patent.  If you're patent covers a readily observable feature such as the shape of a filament in an incandescent light bulb to give more light per Watt then it's better to file a patent.  If it's something that's harder to discern, such as a combination of chemicals that are not easily identified from each other by current methods then a trade secret becomes more attractive."
