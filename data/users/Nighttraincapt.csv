Eugene,ffd18z0,t1_ffcgctf,1579811423.0,"Some of us are pissed. The new payroll tax the city passed,that will mean money taken out of our paychecks ""to help with safety"" REALLY pisses me off. It will provide very little,  maybe two extra bike cops to ride the bike trail, from what I heard. When Wakeup Eugene went en masse to the council meeting apparently they were harassed and threatened by the transients crowd and the council did nothing."

Eugene,ffavafo,t3_esm6li,1579745313.0,"Bastards. And they did it knowing you were home, with cars in the driveway. And they tried your front door? Alarm,  cameras, what more are we supposed to do? And the payroll fees the city is going to take from the paychecks of everyone who works in Eugene is supposed to address this problem. Except the police really don't care.
Edit: My brother was a deputy sheriff from a county in eastern Oregon. He was visiting our mom one day, and we looked out the window and saw someone trying to get into his truck. He chased him, tackled him, and held him at gunpoint until the police arrived. That was very satisfying."
Eugene,ffao5lm,t1_ffak9we,1579740541.0,I did post fliers around the neighborhood. While casually browsing the local sex offenders map I ran across his photo and address. He lived about a mile from me. I seriously considered exacting revenge. But I did not. I like to imagine he already had plenty of suffering in his life. But maybe I was just afraid of how it could go.

Eugene,ff70bwh,t1_ff6utar,1579638572.0,"The federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) applies to residential facilities and provides protection for emotional support animals in addition to service animals.  Thus, property managers, condo associations, co-op boards, and homeowners associations need to keep this in mind when dealing with requests from homeowners and tenants relating to these types of animals.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development has guidance on this topic."

Eugene,ff58fv2,t1_ff588id,1579583320.0,Sometimes I'm sorry I looked. There are actually very few places I'll eat at now. Maybe sometimes what you don't know doesn't hurt you. On the other hand I've never gotten food poisoning.

Eugene,ff3i6he,t1_ff20po6,1579541561.0,"1. Cover letter. Put it in the body of an email if there isn't a form in their application. Brief, one or two short paragraphs. Read their website: ""We love painting houses and we do the extras that make your house look great."" You: ""I want to work for XYZ Painting because your company has been in this area for 25 years and has a solid reputation with customers. I take pride in my work and like to see customers happy with my work and my efficiency."" Or something similar from you but genuine. Why you want to work for that company and not another. 

2.  Find the relevance of your past job experience to the one you're applying for and put that in. 5 years janitorial work, applying for a front desk at a hotel? ""Five years experience guiding work crew, following instructions, organizing materials for the job. Made sure closing procedure was followed."" (Whatever they are looking for in that job description, chances are you've used similar skills elsewhere.)

3. Leave out jobs that didn't end well unless they were long term like two years, and then say, ""Job changed, no longer a good fit."" If they ask in the interview don't bad mouth that supervisor you hated, just say ""I liked many parts of that job but I left to look for something better"" or ""They let me go just before Iwas going to quit because I want happy there any more."" Don't talk too much but answer questions thoroughly, take a minute or two for each question. 

4. Do a mock interview with a friend. 

5. Use words in your Skills section that they use. They want ""someone who can work independently"" make sure you use that phrase.

6. Don't be afraid to apply for a job that seems slightly over your head. You can talk about it at the interview.

edit: How are you going to get to work? Lots of people bike or ride the bus. Don't apply for jobs you can't get to but if you are able to use the bus, lots of people do. If the job is at hours the bus doesn't run and you can't get there, don't apply to that one."

aww,ff08ylo,t1_fey5s22,1579466472.0,"A few years ago my daughter's white cat was missing and we drove around the neighborhood looking for her. We were happy to see her in someone's yard down the street. There were two women in the yard talking to each other, and I couldn't get their attention so I opened the gate and walked in. They just kept chatting. So I walked over to the cat, picked her up and walked back to the gate,  at which point one lady yelled, ""Hey, what are you doing with my cat?"" We had a very brief discussion about whose cat it was-- turned out it was hers-- and I left very embarrassed. Our cat was home sleeping when we're got back there."
Eugene,ff04vuf,t1_fexdb4l,1579465271.0,"ESA are allowed in rentals that pets are not,  by law. Landlords could push back but they will be in trouble if they do. Is it fair? I don't know, but it is the law."
Eugene,ff04g66,t1_fezn67k,1579465107.0,"Seatownbluez has the correct answer. If you've seen a therapist once or twice they should be willing to write you a letter. You say you don't have one. You could find one on PsychologyToday.com who might offer sliding scale fee and you could meet with them. Tell them on initial phone call that you have history of anxiety, could you meet with them a few times, and that you would like a companion animal and would they please assess for that. Maybe start with Celeste Walker."

I've had it five years and have only needed a plumber twice, an electrician once, and a pest guy when I was afraid there was a hornet nest. (There wasn't.) I could use a new kitchen sink but the carpet still looks new, roof has another ten years, so you won't necessarily have high costs. I never have, in any house."

Pointing it at them and having a conversation is a poor tactic. Personally if someone was trying to break into my house I would make sure with my security camera that it wasn't a friend or relative and I would shoot them as soon as they opened the door and started to step in. I would call the cops immediately and tell them someone was breaking into my house, I was afraid for my life, and I shot them. Don't go around breaking into peoples' houses."
