It’s a slow burn so don’t expect non stop action or the usual jump scares but, personally I think it was one of the best horror movies in the last couple years. It’s especially hard hitting because it attacks human sensitivities more than fears. It’s hard to explain without spoiling but midsommar just dropped (in the us) on prime video so if you have prime then you can watch it on there for free without losing much more than time if you didn’t like it."

Heifer: young female cow that hasn’t had any babies

Cow: female that has given birth

Bull: male 

Stud: bull used for breeding. Now this one is tricky because a lot of the most sought after bull studs never actually get to have sex. Instead they are [“milked” ](https://youtu.be/HWS-61ZI8g4) and the semen is put inside sealed straws (about the size of a coffee straw) frozen in liquid nitrogen. Some bulls can produce millions of dollars worth of semen in their lifetimes. 

Steer: neutered male (makes for better meat, and a much better temperament than bulls)

Herd: group of cows/bulls

Beef: sometimes older cows that are no longer good for milking or have reached the end of their breeding cycle are just labelled “beef” and just wait for auction day. Now this is a label we give to older cows and it may be a local colloquialism and is not to be confused with the actual beef breeds"
