He said to me right now you have a problem with depression and soon you'll have another problem, addiction. I'm out of my depression but he was right.

The issue I have right now is the constipation, and insomnia. But it's worth it. I've been so addicted to oxycodone these past few years. As much as I've tried to quit on my own, it was impossible, sure I'd go for a few day's but I couldn't hold out, I would relapse.
