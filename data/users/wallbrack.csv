nursing,ffempq8,t1_ffdfzuc,1579854782.0,"Dude our night shift is such a cult too, I love it. We are all mostly early 20s to mid 30s, hang out outside of work, talk all the time. We have no weak links and are very involved in the hiring process. And a lot of us either came from intermediate cardiac or did new grad rotations there, so we have a lot of respect for our intermediate nurses and vow to not be bitches when we respond to codes. You can’t possibly know everything about 1 of your 6 patients who coded at 2100 while you were still only passing meds on your third patient. Just tell me everything you know and notify the family for me please!"
nursing,ffemdgt,t3_et5u3p,1579854307.0,“No thanks” is a complete sentence. Work your required shifts and say no to anything you don’t have to do. Some bosses ask you in a certain way to make you feel like it’s required.
nursing,ffem5ae,t3_et5z8q,1579853995.0,I’m a pessimist and know someone would choke and that would be the end of it :(
nursing,ffca2sv,t1_ffbpc6m,1579794965.0,Happens ALL THE TIME.
fatlogic,ffaigb1,t1_ff9m0sc,1579736499.0,Ding ding ding.. I’m a cardiac nurse and that’s our major patient population.
fatlogic,ff8f8pf,t1_ff8dqk0,1579675927.0,"You’d be surprised how many people sleep sitting up or in a recliner because of back problems, sleep apnea, or habit. I had one patient sleep upright in a recliner with her eyes open. I’ve seen some crazy shit."
fatlogic,ff83m7b,t1_ff6pmc9,1579665094.0,Those results usually read “poor study due to patient interference” so the radiologist knows. I see those all the time for 30 second CT scans where patients won’t sit the fuck still because “they don’t like laying flat” ... well if you die because we miss something you’ll be laying flat forever soooo ...
fatlogic,ff1tk4x,t1_ff1thqi,1579485863.0,Woooof don’t drink your calories people!!!
fatlogic,feyf5v9,t1_fey8ddt,1579444677.0,"This show is so eye opening! People are straight up delusional about their diets, in the episode I watched the mom claimed she probably wasn’t eating enough when in fact she hit 3000+ kcal a day. Total denial."
medical,fem2h99,t3_epttyj,1579237581.0,"On one hand, if you’re in an emergency or accident they will likely always get an X-ray which would show your situs inversus, but I do agree a medical bracelet could help EMTs on the scene who don’t have access to imaging! Wouldn’t hurt!"
medical,feiubur,t3_epcg2h,1579147426.0,"You’re having weird symptoms because you’re doing meth. Even if you did have something truly wrong with you, all the drug use with mask and or create new symptoms that would make diagnosing your harder. All the ER will tell you is to quit drugs. You know what to do."

medical,fdnu6s7,t1_fdn614d,1578592910.0,"No problem! It’s hard to accept the current reality when he was active before but unfortunately we see that often. We have marathon runners, super active patients who go down really quickly. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. A lot of what he is a candidate for depends on his neurological status. If they suspect he will have neurological deficits or never wake up, they make approach you to de escalate care if it is futile. Just warning you to prepare for that if it happens. We can save the heart but in some cases the brain takes such a hit there is no meaningful recovery."
medical,fdmuk12,t3_em7kr3,1578566481.0,You’re not going to see results in 4 days. That’s an aggressive goal for one month so please be patient.
fatlogic,fdmqvv1,t1_fdjnlpw,1578561326.0,“Obesity related to excessive caloric intake” is what it reads in Epic brand software. Always makes me chuckle.
medical,fdmo45r,t3_em4nyj,1578557596.0,"His heart is failing and if they didn’t have him hooked up to support machines, he would die. Unfortunately when you’re dependent on these machines, full sedation and sometimes paralysis is necessary. You mention they left his chest open, and the use of ECMO which is a type of a ventricular assist device (VAD) both of which require a breathing tube and heavy sedation. When patients wake up from anesthesia they can sometimes be combative and not cooperative, which could damage his body and the machines. It is a shitty risk/benefit analysis. The risks are brain damage, skin breakdown, drop foot, muscle waiting, pressure ulcers, and other side effects of immobility. But the ultimate benefit is saving his life. Is he still a candidate for a heart transplant? Have they done imaging on his brain? Head CT or MRI? His recovery will be long and all of those machines come with risks like strokes. He will require lots of physical therapy and possibly outpatient rehab if he survives this."
nursing,fdm8hmg,t3_ekyrob,1578542417.0,It’s ok to memorize the answers as long as you are reading and comprehending the rationale behind those answers. Memorizing saved my ass bc many PASS CCRNs questions were almost verbatim on my CCRN. No regrets memorizing on my end.
nursing,fdm8cvj,t1_fdi8r2r,1578542322.0,Only BLS? Why not ACLS??
nursing,fdm89ul,t3_el44vx,1578542262.0,"At our hospital the code blue team is the rapid response nurse, the MICU charge nurse, and the CVICU charge nurse + multiple RTs and house supervisors. When I’m CVICU charge I’ll let my coworkers go to get some experience since I’m charge a lot, and sometimes I’m in the middle of something and can’t drop everything to run. I do love it though!!"
nursing,fdm2bmb,t1_fdl1uq8,1578538130.0,Shit if we did that in the icu no one would ever come to work!
