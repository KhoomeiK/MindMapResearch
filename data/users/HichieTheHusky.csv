MadeMeSmile,ff9zxfn,t1_ff9993p,1579725075.0,"I disagree with the person saying religion often leads to insane behaviour.

But i would like you ask you something. You say it doesn't matter what helps a person do good deeds. Bur If for example a Christian does good deeds not because he feels thats the right thing to do, but simply because he believes that this way he will after death go to heaven instead of hell. From the outside perspective he does a huge amount of good, but the only thing stopping him from commiting evil ( or simply becoming ""neutral"" and not doing anything ) is fear of hell, does that not make him bad ( or atleast not a good person ) inherently ? Because he doesn't do good to be good, but for his own gain ( eternal life in heaven). Shouldn't we acknowledge if thats happening ( not saying its happening in the picture, that's impossible to know )

Not wanting to insult anybody, just honest debate/question ( actually first time discussing religion with smb )."

My play space has tv on my back so i prefer not to turn to that direction, but i still want to turn myself more then use controller turning xD.

My board has  has asmedis usb-a 3.1 + usb c and ~6 3.0 intel usb-a. Recently was tinkering with pc so had to unplug and later replug everything, later i noticed i had actually plugged it into the asmedia port instead of intel, but when using the rift-s there were no problems.

gaming,fdzb7me,t1_fdz2czu,1578788440.0,"If looking just at gaming uses. Various guides, aditional infos about games ( maps for games that dont have maps, lots of mmo/rpg info, etc. ), Timers for certain games, excel spreadsheets that contain your personal goal lists or things you are farming or anything else you would want to track or calculate on the fly."
gaming,fdx9g6i,t1_fdwydxj,1578766609.0,"In my opinion Metroidvania elements would be :

1. Unlocking abilities that help during exploration and also usually in combat
2. Exploring previously explored areas with new abilities ( to progress story/level or to find secrets )
3. Gameplay and Level design that encourages exploration
4. complex, interesting, memorable interconnected map, that is limited at first
5. Gameplay, Story, Levels are tigthly integrated together and not just mashed up systems.
6. Sidecrolling platformer

There are probably more that a more knowledgebale person about the topic could write.

But if we look at just these 6, many games have these kinds of elements. The original dark souls ( the sequels less ) actually has kinda have 5 of them though not in the traditional way. It is famous for Nr 4. Nr 3, 5 are also noticeable, whats debatle is 1,2. The game does have the the classic example of ""red door that stops progression untill you get special ability"" that would be the golden barriers that disappear after completing anor londo or ring required to reach the abyss + the many doors requiring specific keys. These are deffinetly not traditional ""abilities"" like in metroid, but achieve a similar goal of stopping and later allowing the player to explore and unlock shortcuts through the interconnected map.

So depending on how many of the elements you think require and how you interpret some of the elements dark souls could be considered a Metroidvania. 

Though just like fallen order i prefer to call it Metroidvania inspired or Metroidvania-lite ( like rogue-like vs rogue-lite ) and keep Metroidvania genre for 2d games that closely follow the formula.

gaming,fdqjeik,t1_fdqi2oe,1578668124.0,"Pre-order olmost always comes with bonus. For instance a lot of nintendo exclusives get steel case for free with pre order. That actually even raises the resell value. So lets say your the kind of guy to play pokemon day 1 and sell after completion, pre-ordering is actually a better deal then day 1 buy.


Though the bonus often is useless. The last game i prerodered was bf3 and it came with first dlc for free , but guess what that dlc also came with its premium dlc ( season pass) which i also bought. So the bonus was useless ( yes im still kinda salty for that)"
