technology,ff9hrru,t1_ff9hdkp,1579713292.0,"Yea, we created that opportunity decades ago. Then they all divided up the country to create little monopolies. Because if any one company competes too well, then we are upset that they have a complete monopoly and we penalize them for it.

Let's say all ISP competed. Then let's say AT&T won. They beat everyones prices, gave the best service and everyone loved using them. People loved them so much that they then cornered the market. Then we would all be mad at AT&T for cornering the market.

Just like people were pissed at the telcos in the first place. Just like people get pissed at big banks or Wal-mart or anything else."
politics,ff9hcz4,t1_ff913cr,1579713040.0,And that is a conversation worth having. I just don't think anyone is ultimately doing Bernie any favors in bringing up incorrect assertions. There is plenty of real and true conversation to have that would benefit him.

Look at the list of states that get more federal money than they pay in. Then look at the states that pay more than they receive. Notice a trend?

So you can burn down the Senate. By actually voting. We live in a country where we have an organized revolution of the people every two years. Sadly, most people don't bother showing up."

politics,ff7ba1v,t1_ff7adej,1579645355.0,"Because the process in the House allowed for witnesses. It allowed for the republicans to participate.

The Republicans are not allowing witnesses. They are not allowing evidence.

politics,fc891ur,t1_fc7h3q0,1577529597.0,"That is NOT the reason we have so many candidates. It is a primary with no incumbent. This is not unusual.

Bernie Sanders DID NOT have the votes to win the primary. He wasn't even close. The primary between Clinton and Obama was MUCH closer than Clinton and Sanders.

As for that ""lawsuit"" that is crazy cakes. That's a bunch of people claiming (without evidence) that the primary was ""rigged"" and that they deserve their money back from donating to Sanders because of the ""rigged"" primary.

This is NOT the DNC ""going to court to fight for the ability to pick the candidate"". This was a response to a class action monetary lawsuit brought by a bunch of Bernie Sanders conspiracy theorists.

This is the problem with Sanders. He has some great ideas and could be a good candidate, but as long as there are people like you who can only support him by spreading insane lies, it is hard ti support him.

If he stands on his own merits, then why do you have to lie like this? Anyone can read the lawsuit and look it up. It wasn't a DNC lawsuit.

""the lawsuit filed on behalf of Bernie Sanders supporters against the Democratic National Committee""

""The class of representatives in the class action lawsuit is currently in the thousands and continuing to grow, as any donor to Bernie Sanders’ campaign eligible to join.""

So if you want to stop spreading lies in an attempt to support Sanders and instead have an honest conversation about him as a candidate, then I am here for it. Otherwise, just stop. You make the crazy conspiracy theorists happy, but you hurt his overall campaign."
