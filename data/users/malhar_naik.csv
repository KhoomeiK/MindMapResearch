I have empathy. I don't have fake empathy. Many of them are back to work. You white knighting for them because it aligns with your political beliefs and crying 'CAUSED BY AN EXPLOSION' doesn't make concussions more severe just because it sounds bad.

I'm a registered democrat and every single day I'm more inclined to change that. I can't stand how every single thing is hijacked for emotional tear jerking. These people signed up to defend the country, they take great pride in what they do and have gone to great lengths to push themselves to be the best soldier they can be.

Just because it was an explosion doesn't mean the injuries are traumatic. Clearly the proximity to the explosion greatly affects the extent of injuries. You being melodramatic because it gives you a soapbox to stand on doesn't make their injuries more severe simply because they were caused by an explosion.
