AmItheAsshole,fdvo3jv,t1_fduj28a,1578749529.0,This thread is really bringing out the entitled people who've never been inconvenienced for transport in their life.
AmItheAsshole,fdvnrob,t1_fduimzi,1578749471.0,"?

I have epilepsy and am not allowed to drive. Public transport in my city sucks so I'm not always able to get it, so sometimes I walk. Which means yes, sometimes I'm walking an hour+ to get places on time. Like... account for how long it takes to get to places? It's not hard."
AmItheAsshole,fdvmwsm,t1_fdue41k,1578749212.0,"Yes, it is very helpful for getting places. It still isn't a right. I have epilepsy so I can't drive - it sucks but that's life. There's public transport which more people should be taking anyway, and cabs if you really need to be somewhere quickly. Not to mention uber in areas that have it, or you know... walking."
AmItheAsshole,fdvlqlo,t1_fdu5bpg,1578748768.0,"She deserves it. If she cannot be trusted to safely drive and not put literally everyone on the road's life at risk then she should not be allowed to do it. Honestly I am glad there's a giant red mark on her record and she'll be held accountable to that. Driving isn't a right, especially for a 16 year old child. ""First offense"". No, probably more like her first time getting caught by a cop. And the next offense could be the one that kills multiple innocent people, and herself. Driving isn't a game and shouldn't be treated as such."
Epilepsy,fdqdrrk,t3_emnwpi,1578664000.0,She is so sweet and looks just like my childhood dog when she was a puppy! Even that little mole on the side of her jaw. What's her name?

todayilearned,fdq6zx1,t1_fdq01s2,1578657566.0,"Canadian, same here. It sounds extremely ungrammatical. As another person commented it's probably because we consider ""the police"" to be a plural noun. For ""is"" to be the correct verb I would have to say ""the policeman is coming""."
canada,fdn11qd,t1_fdlrps7,1578573986.0,Whereas for a a PM it would not be a small part of their life and very pertinent to their job. Obviously some everyday shlub isnt going to be thinking about it all the time.
