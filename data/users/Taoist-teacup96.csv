It’s either that we lose the ship after the first boarding or enemy loses theirs, or it’s back to the ground after we or the enemy defends successfully, and after that period on the ground, either our team or the enemy has always won

I’ve experienced many close calls during the defence phase though, usually either the enemy or our team ”wakes up” after one or two generators have already been destroyed, like ”oh yeah hey, the objective is almost gone, better get up there!”"
