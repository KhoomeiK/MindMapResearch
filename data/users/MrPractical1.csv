I've got paypal or magic the gathering cards. Open to either just the gameboy or a cib if the deal was good enough. i'm eyeing some on fb market place right now and ebay."

I find myself wanting to play my old red play it loud but my brother broke the screen 20 years ago (which I had bc he'd previously broken my original grey gameboy's screen). :-|

I'd jump on a deal like that these days though I wish I could just walk into a shop and have someone cheaply replace my screen. Nothing shows up but you can hear it playing the game."
Gameboy,ffpuuhh,t3_d8c3xj,1580106569.0,I got a red play it loud 11/19/1995 but my brother broke my screen. I find myself wanting to play it though so debating buying a new one or just trying to replace the screen. I also still have that case.

I guess the reason I'm interested is because of being annoyed with different justice systems for haves vs have nots. and the hypocrisy of politicians who don't learn from experiences and keep spouting the same bs.
