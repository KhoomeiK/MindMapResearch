iamatotalpieceofshit,ffdv9ht,t1_ffcz189,1579829788.0,"The practices that most are ""familiar with"" in slaughterhouses don't really happen anymore. They don't kill the animals while their conscious or kick and push them down lanes, or prod and poke them with sharp rods, or drag them by the neck to be slaughtered.

Yes, animals still die for food. The vast majority are killed by huge conglomerates that can afford humane executions, such as rendering them unconscious before slitting their throats. They don't hang upside-down anymore either, so they don't have blood rush to their head and regain consciousness.

All of this is being undone by the current administration's deregulation of the industry though, so they're the ones you should be mad at.

If you honestly think that people will ever stop eating meat, you're naive. Going all-or-nothing and declaring the current state of affairs a travesty because animals are still killed for food is rediculous. You should try to minimize suffering for animals that are killed, not make demands that no one is going to listen to.    

I can also guarantee that abstaining from meat and animal products has near nonexistent effect on the meat industry. All you're doing is absolving yourself of guilt and culpability."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffdu9vr,t1_ffdckkm,1579829084.0,"Veganism aside, there's actually been a lot of restructuring regarding the conditions of slaughterhouses. The government mandated standards championed by this one woman with AS (whos name escapes me) made the entire industry much more humane.

You should really be mad at the current administration for changing the regulations so that all oversight and inspections would be conducted from within the industry instead of by the government. Because trusting them to police themselves is a great idea, right? /s"

todayilearned,ff83beg,t1_ff5sc8k,1579664867.0,"I'm sure there's more to it than that. Global charity is an enormous undertaking and requires a lot of hard work and planning.

Who's going to pay for it?        
Who delivers the food?      
How do we get it there?     
How much food do they need?      
When do they need food?        
Who decides what counts as ""starving?"".      
How do they even find out about it?        
How do we find people who are starving?         
What if we don't speak their language?        
What if they have a weapon?       
What if the food is spoiled?

My disillusionment really started though when I realized the real reason we went to the moon: to beat the Soviets. Most people don't care about space, and NASA gets such a meager budget that colonies are an unrealistic expectation.     

We have telescopes, satellites and the occasional probe. That's pretty much it. SpaceEx isn't off the ground yet and we likely won't see sizable growth in the independent aerospace industry for decades, if at all.

We were born too late to explore the world and born too early to explore ^((our small pocket of)^) the universe. Born at the perfect time to exploring the deep ocean ^((if you're rich)^) and dream about tomorrow I suppose.
