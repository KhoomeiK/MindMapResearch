fatlogic,ffermoc,t1_ffere8i,1579862137.0,"I guess what I am trying to say is, one of the points you mentioned is ‚Äú the idea of I can be big but I don‚Äôt want a big person is so baffling‚Äù. I just think this is not a baffling idea, lots of people don‚Äôt do that level of introspection and the kind of tuning of expectations based on their own qualities. They just want the absolute best (which is fine) but then that gets distorted into looking down on someone they perceive as ‚Äònot the absolute best‚Äô which is the thing they cry out against if it happens TO them"
fatlogic,fferb63,t1_ffer347,1579861654.0,"People will never have problems with wanting to be with someone they perceive as more attractive than themselves. If they get that chance, then all these principled stances go out the window.
But if someone they perceive to be more attractive than themselves comes out and rejects them then they will complain.
Edit: A fat person who doesn‚Äôt want to be with another fat person is a very common thing and mostly they will just go ‚Äúso what?‚Äù. It is just ‚Äúrules for thee not for me‚Äù kinda thing."
fatlogic,ffequy1,t1_ffeko20,1579860996.0,Who is going to say no to hooking up with a more attractive person? No one. No one takes stances based on principles in things like these. It‚Äôs all about saying that stuff on twitter but when it comes to their own selves it is just a simple thing- go for the best available regardless of your own qualities

Kanye,fcolnnn,t1_fcohtsc,1577835351.0,"I think he is capable enough for another album like MBDTF, but he doesn‚Äôt NEED to make it now. Primarily because MBDTF already exists - it was his magnum opus so to speak. So he got nothing left to prove.
Secondarily- he doesn‚Äôt have the angst in him anymore to do that- and that is a good thing. He now has a family, children, he seems to have found his religious path. Basically all the pain that was bubbling up inside of him when he made 808s and then MBDTF (the Taylor Swift thing was also a fresh wound) is not there anymore or at least a lot of that pain is now assuaged to a big degree.
So now I think he is in the ‚Äòreturn to home‚Äô part of his hero‚Äôs journey and MBDTF was the ‚Äòslaying the dragon‚Äô part. There is no dragon left."

AskReddit,fc796od,t1_fc78xns,1577500852.0,YOU feel like you are the same person because probably your inner qualities are something you consider a lot in creating your self image (and that is healthy as hell!) but those same inner qualities were ignored by those people and now the outer qualities which may not figure in your self image for yourself are causing them to change their opinion (which just means they will go back to their old ways if you gain the weight back)
