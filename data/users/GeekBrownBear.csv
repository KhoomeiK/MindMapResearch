sysadmin,ffjgv8k,t1_ffjfpr6,1579997968.0,No idea but if you are in an industry that cares about MISRA I feel your budget would be high enough to afford Eaton.
sysadmin,ffiu0ak,t1_ffirgjc,1579982692.0,Only if you go with APC or Eaton. CyberPower's PDU81003 is only $500 and has 16 24A outlets with switched and metered per outlet. Even cheaper if you only need 8 outlets.
sysadmin,ffitw3z,t1_ffi6ilc,1579982607.0,"Lord. We just spent $500 on the CyberPower PDU81003. Has 16 outlets, switched and metered per outlet, and 3 year warranty. Definitely one of those things where it is cheaper just to buy the prebuilt unit. Safer too."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffisg4h,t1_ffil685,1579981566.0,and that's SPENDING! How much do your gross earnings need to be in order to spend that much on goods and services? Your loans don't count towards this. That's probably a 200k salary.
personalfinance,ffiqlbw,t1_ffi5bbj,1579980253.0,I did the same and also had J in box 7. Went from owing 2k in taxes to not owing 2k in taxes.
LifeProTips,ffgtoc9,t1_fffpak2,1579914785.0,"Mine is a 11 or 12 year old kid that just made the very local news (along with his classmates) for making the honor roll. 

I was there once too, kid. My advice: don't slip up."
funny,ffg400e,t1_ffg3d2k,1579897968.0,Yum! Brands WAS Pepsi. They spun it off as a separate company.
google,ffec9vy,t1_ffe8vzg,1579842871.0,How do you access these? Only visible when you cross a border?
orlando,ffdvxu5,t1_ffdrw43,1579830264.0,Oh lord. can you imagine? Epic Universe being as big as it is and being ONLY Nintendo IP? That would actually be too much!
YangGang,ffdco6d,t3_esttjr,1579818074.0,God damn is our guy so charismatic!! We (the country) need his energy!
chrome,ffb4bz0,t1_ffb3kgp,1579751447.0,Revert to the previous version. Maybe it's a lenovo bug. But the OS should not be affecting the app if there are no bugs.
Office365,ffaz7e2,t1_ffagj3y,1579747902.0,Correct. The details are in the Microsoft Doc about this if you want to read more.
sysadmin,ffaezv0,t1_ff8vl8f,1579734156.0,"Ehh, there are some nice extension too though. I just blacklisted the Bing one: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-search-in-bing/obdappnhkfoejojnmcohppfnoeagadna"
sysadmin,ffaeu42,t1_ff8xdxg,1579734030.0,"Also blacklisted the below extension with Chrome ADMX

orlando,ffacc7h,t1_ffaa2eq,1579732192.0,The city wouldn't have anything to do with traffic flow on a major road like 50. FDOT handles all that. And the city will GLADLY pass the blame to them.
sysadmin,ffa6skm,t1_ffa09lh,1579728991.0,"It's the one in the OP that the group policy sets:
 
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\office\16.0\common\officeupdate] 
    ""preventbinginstall""=dword:00000001

You might be able to actually set this manually since the key is under  Office"
chrome,ff9s7zc,t3_esf37o,1579720070.0,"What are your device and app versions?

I'm running Chrome app 79.0.3945.116 on 10 Jan 1 2020 build QQ1A200105.003 and have the undo notification."
sysadmin,ff8fert,t1_ff8dcps,1579676118.0,"Yeah, it's BS. I would personally go with the registry setting. Can be done on any PC regardless of domain connectivity. Well, so long as your remote control software or deploy software makes it easy."
sysadmin,ff8ct1u,t1_ff8bn8l,1579673223.0,"You can use the ODT with <ExcludeApp ID=""Bing"" /> or an ADMX chrome policy that bans the extension or forces a different search engine. 

Or you can just let it happen and then run C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\DefaultPackPC\MainBootStrap.exe uninstallAll to remove it later. If you do this,  I'm sorry for your thoughts."
business,ff88kj8,t1_ff69cui,1579669139.0,"That would be detrimental to sellers like myself that sell used items. Or small things. I might sell 2-5 items per year but if I had to go FBA it would make things crazy annoying.

If it only applied to new items that might work."
orlando,ff7y9tn,t1_ff7xdv2,1579661227.0,"Bleh, truth. We could be next door neighbors and still experience this..."
orlando,ff7uh0o,t1_ff7bfw3,1579658651.0,Didn't it rain over the weekend pretty hard? Not for long but strong quick downpour.
YouShouldKnow,ff731kd,t1_ff5jy09,1579640121.0,Yep! You can do the same in OneDrive and Google Drive as well. I think Box.com also has it.
MacroPorn,ff4xhl6,t3_ere3xb,1579574802.0,LUCAS! :D
microsoft,fey0cvg,t3_eqvsiq,1579439036.0,"Not a employee of either store but I've noticed many of the Microsoft store employees are well versed in Microsoft technologies. While they are not subject matter experts, they do hold a great deal of knowledge I wouldn't expect from a typical sales worker. Just something to keep in mind depending which brand you prefer more.

I don't doubt it is less stressful, the stores are glorified display cases that coincidentally allow you to buy products."
fixit,fexz96l,t1_fexxgnr,1579438671.0,The front is stainless and not magnetic. The sides are the more familiar material and are magnetic
aviation,fexwn5y,t1_fexuuae,1579437685.0,Some are stored overhead in the aisle and need to be carried out of they plane for use.
chrome,fet7ryl,t3_eqiqi3,1579372513.0,This is not a chrome issue. Google has made a change to their Search results page. If you don't want to see those anymore use a different search engine.
business,fesxd9c,t1_feq1ob7,1579369892.0,"Not all but Takata is the biggest manufacturer of airbags so A LOT is affected. And since death from something that is supposed to save your life is kinda bad many of the car markers were being overly cautious. Here is the list of affected marks from Wiki:

>As of December 9, 2016, car manufacturers affected by this recall include Acura, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Daimler Trucks North America, Daimler Vans USA LLC, Dodge/Ram, Ferrari, Fisker, Ford, GMC, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Jeep, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Mazda, McLaren, Mercedes-Benz, Mercury, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Pontiac, Saab, Saturn, Scion, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota, and Volkswagen."
business,feookhs,t1_feojexd,1579303112.0,Completely agree. I just don't have those numbers off the top of my head. Got gas earlier today so I did a quick mpg calculation lol
business,feoftxo,t1_fent0ea,1579299582.0,"Yes, but what does this have to do with Toyota specifically? Honda, Ford, Nissan, etc were all using Takata airbags."
business,feofhu0,t1_feo3uv1,1579299474.0,"I wonder how much is also replaced in EV. Tie rods, shocks, electrical components? Gas+Oil for 200k miles would cost me about 30k though. Tires are changed on all vehicles. A full comparison of the long term life a car would be interesting."
google,fen96cy,t3_epzwti,1579279696.0,Interesting. The snippet is poorly composed though. Says the same thing twice but cuts off the first sentence. Suspenseful!
orlando,feh792j,t3_ep4xph,1579110611.0,It's not a general mechanic but the team at Audi North Orlando is amazing. I've done some IT work for them and they were really friendly and the shop was super clean.
Insurance,feedsm0,t1_feebpdf,1579031684.0,Ah true true. Though there are a few carriers that give complementary once a year replacements (or similar) regardless of type of coverage purchased. I think State Farm is one of them.
Insurance,fecfw46,t1_febx010,1578972938.0,Only if you have comprehensive.
windows,fe6arv0,t1_fe3p1qr,1578885677.0,Herd immunity!
Economics,fe69f9k,t1_fe68y7s,1578884713.0,"Linkedin, indeed, college postings, monster, jobs, Facebook, careers.gov."
YouShouldKnow,fd5h25s,t1_fd5c6f7,1578177563.0,Fair point. But pride of country can be a huge motivator. We didn't go to the moon because it was going to make us rich; we did it so we could stick it to the Russians.
YouShouldKnow,fd57o6f,t1_fd53sps,1578174987.0,"I have no doubts the Chinese military is far more financially efficient than ours though. Everything we pay a premium for likely doesn't happen in China where the government owns everything and can set prices. Think about those ""mil spec"" bolts that cost $20/piece."
WTF,fcyyezy,t1_fcywnn9,1578089837.0,"4 lane road = 2 lanes in either direction. 

And honestly they should change it. It should be a bigger fine. Overly cautious is better than just enough. Don't fuck with safety and especially the safety of children."
YangForPresidentHQ,fcvybdo,t1_fcvxuxt,1578012877.0,Ohhh. Gotcha. I've never seen the - symbol used to mean that. I would have written it Q2 -> Q3 or Q2>Q3
YangForPresidentHQ,fcvv7lx,t1_fcvqrrd,1578010848.0,"What?

Q4 is more than the combined preceding 3 quarters by 2.1M"
HomeNetworking,fci7dag,t1_fci5n8r,1577658614.0,"Yep. Unless you have all the hardware and money to make this worth while you will never see it come to fruition. 

We had 10g at work and quickly sold off all our switches because it was useless for us. I think it would only be functional in a video house and would be running fiber at that point."
business,fc73dz5,t1_fc6rehp,1577496462.0,Agreed! There is so much salt. I've had only a couple and that's enough. It's just rubbery salt :/
microsoft365,fbwtvae,t1_fbwlo4j,1577159295.0,"That's for Partners. I think the Developers platform would work well. 25 users as well, lasts 90 days. Perfect for testing and once you know how to powershell a full deployment you can spin up a whole 25 users just how you like it in seconds.
