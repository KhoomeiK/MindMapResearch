Seoul is easily within the range of many North Korean missiles, as is Tokyo.  Their intermediate range missiles threaten Guam and Hawaii.

Given their extremely limited ability to place satellites in orbit, I would take their ability to threaten Europe or the mainland US with ICBMs with a grain of salt.  Possible, but unless China or Russia have taught them how to miniaturize warheads, it's probably unlikely they could hit major US cities other than Honolulu with a nuke.

But since they have nuclear weapons, you have to take North Korea seriously.  They're a particularly dangerous case in that the regime intensely hates the rest of the world and cares only about its own survival.  Armed conflict on the Korean peninsula could easily result in Seoul or Toyko being nuked and tens of millions dead.

No, we don't know more about the universe than we do about our own ocean.  Humans have been living beside, traveling across, and exploring the ocean for thousands of years.

It's an exaggeration meant to drive home that there's still a lot we have yet to discover about the oceans.

But there is *infinitely* more that we have yet to discover about space and the universe."

You're never going to get healthy that way.

You don't get there by nibbling lettuce.

Do you want help or not?"

I wanted to be a rockstar so bad at 13.

I've spent the last 20 years honing my skills on the bass guitar and have actually achieved a modicum of success as a musician in a regionally successful band.

Like, not just playing bars; we are on the festival circuit. Some radio play.  Pretty successful.  Lots of hits on spotify.

But as a 36 year old, I feel kinda like a joke.

I have a career in insurance, but music is just all I want to do.

I feel like people judge me for being a 36 year old in a band.

Edit:  Thanks for all the positive feedback, everybody!  I went through all of the hundreds of replies and I don't think I saw a single negative comment.  You're all too kind.

I'm kind of kicking myself for not using a throwaway for this comment; I didn't expect it to get this much of a response.  Unfortunately, if I share the band name, I'll basically doxx myself, as someone pointed out below (I mean, my real name is right on the front page of our website and on fb and IG).  One of the things I love about reddit is the anonymity.  

I promise, next post or comment I make about the band, I'll use a throwaway so you can hear the music and I can get the free plug haha!"

That's the only answer you need."
relationship_advice,ff4y84w,t3_ernv6r,1579575316.0,"I'll be brutal: weight shouldn't really be a huge issue if you're talking 30 pounds here or there.  Shit happens, people change and gain and lose weight.  I've been with women who have gained and lost more than that and it was not an issue for me.

But 370 lbs is way up there.

You need to get a handle on this problem.

It's no less of a problem than alcoholism or any other addiction.  You are not healthy, and need to take steps to fix it.

I'm all about body positivity, but unless you're eight feet tall, there's no way 370 lbs is healthy.

There are subs to help you find resources and support on your journey to being healthier."
