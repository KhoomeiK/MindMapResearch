namethatcar,ffe1zt0,t1_ffdalnq,1579834618.0,Sorry they aren't. The first year was 1954 which is obviously after this truck was made. I have a 1971 trailer that doesn't even have a vin number.
farmingsimulator,ffb77do,t1_ff7xpnj,1579753664.0,I'd try another contract. Like I said I'll grab a contract just to use the tractor sometimes.
farmingsimulator,ff6znym,t1_ff686rc,1579638185.0,Tractors from contracts can tow tippers and other trailers for sure. I'm not sure if they can work other machines so I'll grab a contract that I dont want to do but has a nice tractor and use that if I need it for a while. The field I used the leased tractor and harvester on was barren for a while and replanted right after I repaired the tractor so maybe it was the field regrowing that returned the leased items.
farmingsimulator,ff67jgx,t3_erqldh,1579620995.0,I had this happen to me. It disappeared after I repaired it.
farmingsimulator,fezu4x5,t3_equh6c,1579461686.0,And then it gets destroyed if a worker runs a tool into it.
farmingsimulator,fetol93,t3_eqdk5n,1579377665.0,"Is there a good reason to trade out old equipment in fs19? In 17 the daily costs were enough to get me to trade out, but do the repair costs go up with hours in 19?"
BitchImATrain,fepn3hu,t3_eq14ra,1579324918.0,Apparently you can hump a train car. This means to push it over a hump and let gravity bring it to its final destination where someone will select a track for it.  This would also be a good train fact to let people know.
mechanical_gifs,fepjh34,t1_fepiqt4,1579322087.0,"That's because these cable spool designs are garbage. I've replaced several of these, but never a scissor design. This design might take up a little less space, but I'm not sure on that."
farmingsimulator,feh49jq,t1_feeg78d,1579108830.0,Cant you just turn off traffic for a moment?
IllegalLifeProTips,feh2ck1,t1_fegx4ix,1579107685.0,I dont know of any pet store that would sell roaches that would infest a hotel. You'd have to buy German cockroaches online. Any that you find at a pet store are species that dont thrive outside of their enclosures for a reason.
wallstreetbets,feb4h7z,t1_fe5e4xe,1578955328.0,Of course it can be done cheaper. Unless you are willing to start fixing and flipping houses in Detroit and do most of the work yourself this is not a good idea. Might as well buy a fixer upper near where you live and you'll be able to actually sell it once its livable and stay there while you work on it. This is WSB not some plumbing/handyman forum though. Bad idea from the start to try this anywhere that people aren't moving too.
wallstreetbets,fe91082,t1_fe82cn5,1578933017.0,England is nicer than Detroit.
farmingsimulator,fe8qx2x,t1_fe82wy9,1578929571.0,This trailer is available as a mod on fs19. It's a fleigl.
IllegalLifeProTips,fe4nzf9,t1_fe2l2d9,1578861223.0,That was just the first one that came to mind. Completely average movie for me. I definitely didn't hate it.
wallstreetbets,fe3buf1,t1_fe32jq6,1578847891.0,"Even if it wasn't stripped, all the pipes would have burst from freezing. $1000 house, $10000 in back taxes, $7500 in plumbing, and who knows what in asbestos removal just to even have a house that would need $50000 in cosmetic updates."
IllegalLifeProTips,fe07z37,t1_fdzx5my,1578805502.0,You'd also end up being charged with burglary tools and then have a felony for stealing Daddy's Home 2.
Entrepreneur,fdxoydn,t1_fdwc7w1,1578771345.0,"After listening to the planet money episode on the international shipping thing, it seems like that agreement will be coming to an end sometime this year."
farmingsimulator,fdq4jon,t3_ekclgh,1578654513.0,There should be a little puzzle piece icon when purchasing equipment that tells you what else is needed. For example a new Holland harvester head will list the model of harvester that it works with and vice versa.
Futurology,fdov6i3,t1_fdosb6l,1578613605.0,Its probably just because its ugly.
stocks,fdjouk1,t1_fdinv9n,1578481392.0,Unless they were options. Then its gone.

recruitinghell,fdezuhj,t1_fdeyynb,1578350140.0,"I would say that the personality inventory test the give are just as weird: Who was a better president, George Washington or Abraham Lincoln? Should people vote because it's their civic duty? Do you look down on people for not voting because it's their civic duty?
The other psych test seemed a lot more normal because it asked if you've ever had mental illness symptoms like seeing or hearing things, but then it asked if you have ever had pain in your neck."
motorcycles,fdez14k,t1_fdejipa,1578349631.0,"I saw one on craigslist that basically said ""I like modding bikes so here's one with $3000 in upgrades for brand new price with 400 miles."" Its a pretty weird thing to do even if you have an itch for more horsepower."
todayilearned,fd71ubg,t1_fd5xvyc,1578198405.0,"I remember being given access to the armory because I spent so much time ""volunteering"" at the range. Some places treated Explorers as equals and others treated it like a scared straight type program. It's not all that uncommon for Explorers to impersonate cops though. Some of them at regionals told me about doing liquor stings, driving with the lights on, and walking into clubs by themselves. There were some caught stealing cars last year or the year before and driving them on the highway in California I believe."
niceguys,fd56mnh,t1_fd51rb2,1578174712.0,Also that guys dick in her pussy if you look real close.
Cartalk,fd4s3xf,t1_fd3bmoe,1578170568.0,I've seen one do about 105.
CrackheadCraigslist,fd4q28y,t1_fd3owmx,1578169969.0,I dont think they meant that they neglected it. More like it was neglected.
AskReddit,fczmqqh,t1_fcwtecf,1578104614.0,In Aurora CO a cop was very clearly drunk on duty. The chief decided to just demote him because the chief is about to retire anyway. The local sheriff called him out publicly. Too bad it's not going to do anything in reality.
AskReddit,fcwmf28,t1_fcwhjz2,1578029751.0,It's weird that this actually happens. It seems so innocent.
RoastMyCar,fcsje16,t1_fcqk4vg,1577917743.0,Harbor freight has little clip and screw assortment packs for like $6. Less with a coupon. Should fit your TV company made car nicely.
wallstreetbets,fcqtmtm,t1_fcpo5zt,1577892018.0,Fuck their stupid slogan too. Ohohwoahoh
wallstreetbets,fcqt8q2,t1_fcngdci,1577891844.0,Put two of them up your ass.
wallstreetbets,fcqrznv,t3_eihjak,1577891293.0,"What about ""I'm guhving up on you"" as runner up for song of the year?"
todayilearned,fcqmxpv,t1_fcpztow,1577888831.0,"I love that video. Try driving in a blizzard when half the cars have their flashers on and you'll go insane. ""Sorry I rear ended you, you weren't using your brake lights."""
Entrepreneur,fcd1c04,t3_eguuec,1577605137.0,There is a podcast by nick looper on the side hustle show where he interviews the guy that started 1-800-got-junk. You should check it out.
StockMarket,fc4v4rg,t1_fc4co27,1577429644.0,It's the second biggest only to personal finance. I thought there would be more resistance from these subs honestly.
wallstreetbets,fc4th16,t1_fc4o75e,1577427786.0,"That's good to know, thanks. I've seen the 3X SPY before but I never figured there were people comfortable holding that as an investment."
wallstreetbets,fc4evv0,t1_fc1hqfl,1577414651.0,What the fuck kind of dollar amounts are those?
wallstreetbets,fc49w5v,t1_fc3pwdh,1577410592.0,Definitely dont go long on these and plan to hold. Any leveraged ticker is meant to fuck over longs and is for speculation.
todayilearned,fc2cfgl,t1_fc2950n,1577351968.0,"Yup. Russia made billions of rounds for the same gun that was used in the 1800s until the cold war. It's weird to see it loose in a box, and its probably not realistic, but buying old russian ammo is pretty common."

wallstreetbets,fbzf8k2,t1_fbzaiwl,1577244715.0,Yup. Best tax guys are the ones that owe the IRS at least a million.
