It's a tunnel through spacetime. You leave one place and time and appear at another place and time.

If you understand that wormholes move through SPACETIME not just space, and you understand that you can jump from one point in space to another, then where are you getting stuck? I'm already travelling through spacetime, why is travelling only through time difficult to imagine?

Since you left the space associated with your coordinate in space time, you also left the time associated with that coordinate. You're now at a different coordinate with both a different space AND a different time because, again you moved through spacetime, not just space.

 
 There's nothing to disagree with, it's how it works, but I totally get how it can be difficult to visualize or understand.

Here's right off wikipedia

iamverysmart,fgeh1tm,t1_fgeg9r5,1580699339.0,"That's like saying it's okay to teleport left and right but that we shouldn't be able to teleport up and down. They're just coordinates in spacetime.

One point in spacetime is allowed to connect to any other point in spacetime. Since space and time are connected, it is impossible to allow moving through space without also allowing moving through time.

x and y movements are just as valid as t movements."
worldnews,fgefjg6,t1_fgcrnbm,1580698386.0,You mean the close golfing buddies that Trump has been photographed with? He says he doesn't remember ever meeting them.
iamverysmart,fgedp0c,t1_fgecj57,1580697178.0,I'm not following what you mean. Theoretically we could have a wormhole that connects two points in the same space but separated by time. If I traveled back 5 minutes then yes there would be 2 versions of me. If I traveled forward there would only be 1.
iamverysmart,fgeaf74,t1_fge9hvl,1580695057.0,"That's because a diagram can't actually show time curves.

You're imagining a piece of paper that has different (x,y) coordinates, but each point on the paper is at the same time. So when you curve the paper you teleport from (x,y)=(1,2) to (18,20). But of course both locations are at the same time, because the whole paper was at the same time to begin with.

But time is a coordinate itself. Time can't be constant over the entire paper, because as you move a along the time axis time is changing. So think of the paper as (x,t). 

Since it's 2d we can only have 2 coordinates so you're teleporting from one point on a line at one time (1 meter into the line right now) to (8 meters in 4 minutes from now) or from (1,0) to (8,4)."
iamverysmart,fge7p5f,t1_fge5nmx,1580693252.0,">My point is we're bending spacetime, and as a consequence of bending space you're also bending time.

That's 100% correct.

>In essence, to me it seems like you can't control the ""time"" variable, it's going to go with the space and thus remain the same.

I'm not sure what you mean by control. We aren't controlling anything, the wormhole connects two otherwise separate points in space and time. You're jumping from one coordinate to another.

You seem to understand that we are jumping from one point in space to another. Since space and time are essentially linked, by making the ""jump"" you are ALSO jumping from one time to another. How can you ""teleport"" through spacetime by teleporting through space and NOT time?

A black hole is a tear in spacetime. It's an object so massive, that spacetime curves so much it leaves a hole. Anything inside the event horizon exists OUTSIDE the fabric of spacetime. That's why we say we can't know what happens in it.

A wormhole isn't a tear in the same way, it's more like a door that leads somewhere else. Someone going though it would EXPERIENCE the normal passing of time, but might find that they're actually in a younger universe (or older, or the same age).

And you're not an idiot. You're just trying to understand. Sorry if my explanation isn't the best, but I'm enjoying the conversation."
iamverysmart,fge3il9,t1_fge1a72,1580690520.0,"I'm confused what you mean now. I'm the one saying that space and time are essentially tied together and I thought you were saying the opposite.

Time 0 is just set by initial conditions. I could say that now is time 0, ten seconds from now is t=10 and 1 minute ago is t=-60."
iamverysmart,fgdx700,t1_fgdsa1h,1580687953.0,"Think of it like coordinates. In 3d space you could teleport from (0,0,0) to (100,50,68). But this isn't 3d space it's 4d spacetime. There's 4 coordinates (x,y,z and t). So ""teleporting"" could take you from (0,0,0,0) to any other coordinate, meaning any other place OR time.

You're trying to say a wormhole in 4d spacetime would take you from (0,0,0,0) to (100,50,68,0) instead of (100,50,68, anything else). There's no special reason time needs to restrict you that way."

Time is not constant, time runs slower the faster things move or the more gravity they experience. We always move at the speed of light. We can choose to move through time only by standing still, or through space only by moving at the speed of light. Either way, space and time are closely connected."
