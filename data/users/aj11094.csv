movies,fexo0di,t1_few4ppf,1579433805.0,"I'd honestly prefer a middle ground where I could pay a lesser amount to have the download rights to a film, then I could pay an X amount to download and preserve an 80-90gb version of any film and watch it on a phone, tablet, laptop, tv or projector. Sure it would require a big ass hard drive, but it's better than hoarding on to DVDs and using old school hardware. Currently my film collection consists of 1080p (2gb-3gb a film) torrents. I'm not proud of it, but my alternatives are streaming, renting, dvd hoarding, or purchasing it through unreliable sources such as Google play."

movies,fealxrk,t3_eo49k1,1578950212.0,"Some observations:

- Parasite better win something, that film was crazy good to not be appreciated, hopefully Best Director or Film, though the latter will probably go to Joker or 1917.

- Joaquin's gonna win best actor, picking anyone else would just be a publicity stunt. (Hello La La Land)

- I'm surprised to see that Christian Bale and Taron Edgerton didn't even get nominated for Best Actor. Bale brought a lot of heart to the role, and Edgerton nailed one of the most difficult roles ever. He was much better than Rami in Bohemian. Instead we have Pryce and Leo for some reason.

- Park So-Dam deserved a nomination too. The way the academy still continues to be partial to period dramas is ridiculous.

- Us might have been an average film, but it's sad to that Lupita Nyong'o has got gotten no recognition for her superb performance. Oscars or otherwise. 

- Guess I gotta add The Two Popes, Judy and Bombshell to my Oscar binge list. Not too excited about that, but at least there's 1917, Jojo Rabbit, Irishman and Marriage Story to look forward to.

- Brad Pitt deserves the Best Supporting Actor win for simply saying, ""Nah, it was dumber than that"" in the most hysterical way possible.

- Star Wars ROTJ is a Visual Effects nominee.... lol. That's probably gonna go to The Expressionless King... at least we won't have to put up with a live performance of Spirit.

- At some point during the academy's committee meeting, there was a long pause to think of a worthy fifth nomination for the Animation Film category, until someone remembered How to Train Your Dragon 3, and everyone just went, ""Fuck it, that'll do."""
todayilearned,feabuwf,t1_fe9zksr,1578946770.0,"Especially because people often change lanes or take turns without using indicators. How the hell am I supposed to know that the car on the side that's barely moving at dead speeds is being parked or coming on to the road? when the person doesn't give me an indicator (happened today). 

Also, why can't people here walk on the footpath? Most lanes are narrow and two way. If someday I have to choose between colliding with a car or breaking a person's arm cause he/she is walking on the road, I'm gonna break that arm."
todayilearned,feaaocm,t3_eo69vw,1578946351.0,"I almost never honk when I'm driving, expect when I wish to tell the guy in front of me that he is driving too slow, or I'm crossing a narrow lane and want to warn speeding bikers and rickshaws, or wish to move some fool who's walking on the road instead of the sidewalk and also using the phone (geniuses), or to warn the rickshaw/biker coming from the opposite direction rashly trying to overtake a fucking car in a lane, or to tell the idiot in front of me at the signal to make a move so that I'm not left waiting once again, or to show my frustration when the driver in front of me is blocking my rturn cause he purposely came in the wrong line for the sake of skipping a few cars, or to express my shock when some asshole decides to drive into a one way lane....

If he's nominated for the Supporting Role category, he definitely deserves to win it.

I loved the camera on my old phone, and having used the Pixel 3 and 3a has really helped me see what a smartphone cameras could be, sadly Google's specsheets and yesteryear's hardware don't justify the price. 

Asus and OnePlus are the two brands I'm most keen on, but the cameras are holding me back. I'd personally love to see what they do with the ROG Phone and OnePlus 8, Samsung's S10E would be a great buy due to it's hardware and one hand usage, but it's out of my budget, and I hate using custom OS devices."

Put aside the fact that the ""trilogy"" is poorly written, disjointed in tonality, rushed in pace and unoriginal (not to forget how it mocks the original films while also relying on their nostalgia factor) and you can see why the fans aren't happy. But what makes it worse is the realization  that with actors like Hamill, Ford, Fisher, Ridley, Driver, Serkis and Isaac, they really should have created something much much better."
