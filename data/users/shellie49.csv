cats,fehf9tq,t1_fegl0kc,1579115337.0,I got an programmable cat feeder off of eBay. My cat knows I'm not the source of food so she won't beg me and she has learned that she can yell at the robot all she likes but it's not gonna give in. It was funny watching her try to fight with it though.

cats,fdsg1rk,t1_fdsfuly,1578701969.0,It's very gross. Especially when she lays on my stomach facing me and shakes her head. It's like a sprinkler. I love her anyway though :)

relationship_advice,fdorj2e,t3_emd698,1578611280.0,Don't give in! You deserve to be happy and there was an agreement in place. Do not allow yourself to be a pushover for your GFs family. There's a fine line between helping people and getting taken advantage of. Sister 3 had a year to demonstrate that she is fully capable of following rules which she did not do. Sister 2 needs to grow up or Sister 3 needs to find roommates. She's an adult. She can handle herself.
cats,fdoq5vb,t3_em9s6d,1578610371.0,My cat is about to get on a 13-hour flight from Jacksonville to Washington state. This is her on a ride to a vet. I can't imagine what it's going to be like for her in cargo.

You're looking for answers from strangers on the internet who cannot begin to comprehend your full relationship.  You know what you want to do, it was the first thing you wrote down without giving any context whatsoever. If you need the blessing of an internet stranger to be happy, then please, go ahead and do what it takes to be happy. 

You're ""exhausted"" and, well, shit happens. Not all marriages last and it seems like you would be putting yourself through torture to salvage something you don't want to have anymore."
relationship_advice,fc0duv3,t1_fc0dtli,1577288097.0,I don't believe so but she seems well within her means
