The temperature hasn’t even been rising the past ten years and almost all of the record high temperature were recorded in the 1930s. What bothers me is the IPCC reports which are used as the golden standard for this whole thing use terms of reference that specifically stated they were looking for “human sources of climate change” and not “all causes of climate change”. So those reports started with a bullshit premise. It’s pure insanity to be honest. It’s no wonder scientists have stated that what they’re doing isn’t really science but more propaganda.

The Great Scam. So many people want to take an institution that has the worst track record of all and give them the keys to your lives because you think that this time it’ll be different.

For some reason people think that giving someone absolute power over more facets of your life will somehow be the right move if they could just get their shit-covered party in power. Fuck them. They shouldn’t even be capable of being corrupted because the power they would wield would be so small they wouldn’t be worth paying and even if they did get paid, they wouldn’t be able to do anything anyways. No matter the party or the system, there will always be corruption. Democrats are no better than those fat cat Republicans. In fact, I’d argue they’re worse at the moment because of the support for a minimum wage among other not-so-subtly hidden classist, racist and eugenicist policies they promote. 

The minimum wage was literally created to keep minorities from taking the jobs of whites. That was the whole point, they didn’t give a fuck about anything else, there was no side effects considered other than not wanting the Irish, blacks and other undesirables to work jobs that were for more educated (or deserving) whites. 

This and Planned Parenthood among others were all ideas that were created by the eugenicist movement in the late 18 and early 1900s (although the movement is alive and well, the term just fell out of style). Below is an excerpt from a paper that sums it up pretty well. Link is included. 

[Progressive economists, like their neoclassical critics, believed that binding minimum wages would cause job losses. However, the progressive economists also believed that the job loss induced by minimum wages was a social benefit, as it  performed the eugenic service ridding the labor force of the “unemployable.” Sidney and Beatrice Webb (1897 [1920], p. 785) put it plainly: “With regard to certain sections of the population [the “unemployable”], this unemployment is not a mark of social disease, but actually of social health.” “[O]f all ways of dealing with these unfortunate parasites,” Sidney Webb (1912, p. 992) opined in the Journal of Political Economy, “the most ruinous to the community is to allow them to unre- strainedly compete as wage earners.” A minimum wage was seen to operate eugen- ically through two channels: by deterring prospective immigrants (Henderson, 1900) and also by removing from employment the “unemployable,” who, thus identified, could be, for example, segregated in rural communities or sterilized. The notion that minimum-wage induced disemployment is a social benefit distinguishes its progressive proponents from their neoclassical critics, such as Alfred Marshall (1897), Philip Wicksteed (1913), A. C. Pigou (1913) and John Bates Clark (1913), who regarded job loss as a social cost of minimum wages, not as a putative social benefit (Leonard, 2000](https://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf)"

Or I guess I should say a very small select group did not Britain as a whole but still the Kaiser and Germany as a whole had no interest in war. The unification of the Germanic states was advancing at a pace that was astronomical in the 1800s. Continued unfettered, they would have surpassed Britains death grip over the world barring some large destabilizing event. 

I also always thought it was kind of funny how everyone for some reason doesn’t think it’s odd that the Nazi party and the Bolshevik revolution were both guided and funded by the american and British governments as well as several key multinational corporations. 

There is no better term for both of them than:
