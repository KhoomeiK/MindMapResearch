fatlogic,ffc39vy,t1_ffbndww,1579790466.0,"My mum always yells at me to BE CAREFUL when I tell her about my exercise, eating plans, and recently trying a 48 hour fast. She never once told me to be careful when I was eating recklessly and gaining weight, and sitting around, and being bored and fat.

Oh but now I have control over my intake and output and am at a healthy size and weight, suddenly everyone has an opinion about it's dubious safety. Those people all happen to be overweight too.

Crabs in a bucket, man. (Still love you though mum!)"

I have the Aldi zero carb bread but I think keto beans are just a pipedream. Marmite is good though!"
bonnaroo,ffb96pz,t1_ffb5m5s,1579755774.0,"Amazing! I'm in Tennessee and found the competition online, their terms and conditions said it would be a call in competition so I tried to call and was bummed when they announced you had to go there in person, but then they said you were wearing a Roo shirt and were there for ages waiting, and it made me feel happy you won. Congrats! See you at the farm sis!"

bonnaroo,ff3rd02,t3_er6u5a,1579547195.0,"I've been twice and the first one was amazing. As the other poster says it's the same food and similar experience a second time so probably just good to do once. Didn't help that we had to leave AJR's set to go to the meal which was annoying. But free beers and good food, fun conversation and a new Roo experience. The first year we got to keep our stainless steel cups, but they told us to leave them there last time."
aldi,ff1vdqg,t3_er4xw5,1579487026.0,"I used to love their low carb coconut elevation bars until they suddenly had that 'Hersheys' sick taste to them one day. I guess they changed the recipe, to sick."

* Starting weight: 153 lbs
* Starting BMI: 24 
* Goal weight: 129 lbs
* Current weight: 139 lbs
* Current BMI:  21.9

**Bad things**: I miss drinking wine. I miss those days I could just sup away a bottle of red. But I have to remind myself that this is wayyy better for my body.

**Good things**: People are noticing my weight loss already.

**Lessons learned**: work out in the morning so I don't have chance to back out.

**Goal for this week**: see above!

**Mood**: sleepy and lazy."
1200isplentyketo,fev9jey,t3_epm66t,1579394760.0,"Teaching myself to view food as fuel. Most of my 'hunger' is boredom, and food was always a fun thing to do or a reward. So I started making meals that were nice, not thrilling, but adequate and nutritional. In addition, I never use food as a reward anymore, but instead allow myself other rewards like an extra hour in bed, a mini splurge on Amazon, or a nice long hot shower. I've also started drinking ketoade instead of snacking. All of this is really helping my attitude to only eating when I need fuel.

I still fucking love good food, but I know I don't really need it anymore."

bonnaroo,fejr58f,t1_fej3ors,1579183772.0,"Look up chicharrones, pork scratchings have the texture of corn puff snacks but they're fried pork fat - delicious!

I buy the refrigerated stuff in the packet, until it's opened the first time it doesn't need to be kept cool. Dried stuff works too.

The recipe I use for ketoade is 24 oz water with 1 tbsp magnesium citrate, 1 tsp lo salt, three squirts of mio or water flavoring. Beats other electrolytes drinks hands down.

If you see a bacon colored van and hear a British girl, come for a keto high five!"
bonnaroo,feizziv,t3_epbmzv,1579152086.0,"Mission low carb wraps keep really well without too much refrigeration. I bring tinned tuna and those individual guac packets from Aldi, maybe add some cheese, awesome keto wrap.

Pork scratchings dipped in same guac pots is amazing.

For snacks we bring almonds, jerky, pepperoni slices, cheese slices, and cold cut meats. Oh and a couple of sticks of celery for when you've got the dry mouth.

Bacon and eggs are good, but getting ham, wrapping it up with cheese in, and frying it in the bacon fat, is king.

For sweet stuff, get a few Quest bars. Get more than you think you need as they keep, so you can take them home again.

Don't forget to mix a few pints of ketoade for those hangovers!

Edit: also sorry you're having to defend your way of eating in here! The vendors are still a little behind in the low carb life, but you can find meat options and ask to sub out stuff pretty easily in my experience."

keto,fefx1n6,t3_eowvzi,1579068018.0,"Firstly, weigh the bowl you're measuring in. This will help you when you get distracted and the scale turns off while your in the middle of weighing, and then you have to figure out how much of the weight is the bowl.

Also, I first 'stage' the recipe - before I start cooking, I add everything in to my app at a weight that seems to sound right (an ounce of cheese, a stalk of celery, a small head of cauliflowers etc etc). Then I weigh and adjust as I go. This helps me adjust on the fly based on my goals.

Lastly, I paper track the important numbers before logging them. I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally deleted something off the app because of oily foody fingers. A quick jot on paper before I log keeps things safe.

I'm a bit neurotic, but it works!"
