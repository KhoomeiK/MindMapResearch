I got out of it and got sober and while at my sober house got a job at a dog daycare and boarding place. It’s like the perfect sober job. You work hard and clean and pick up a lot of shit but it’s hard to be upset or depressed when you also get to play with dogs all day. They kept me sane. Congrats on the new job man!!"

My hunter safety instructor was like “use whatever the hell you want to kill pigs, bombs, mortars, howitzers, we don’t care.” It’s not uncommon to see dead pigs on the sides of country roads because people just pull their gun as soon as they see them and start blasting."

PeopleFuckingDying,fg5ogja,t1_fg5kvrn,1580533311.0,"Well I guess we disagree on that. What I was meaning is that dogs that are neutered before they are maybe 6 months old and start getting their sexual hormones are less typically less aggressive than those that haven’t been. Not specifically Pitts. They were bred to be guard dogs, but they are so cute and sweet when raised to be family dogs. I have yet to meet one that’s aggressive. I would never fuck with one too bad or attack it’s owner but I wouldn’t do that with any big dog, or any dog for that matter lol but you know what I’m saying."
PeopleFuckingDying,fg5h10h,t1_fg5fclh,1580527246.0,Well all dogs are less aggressive if you neuter or spay them as puppies before they get their hormones.

PeopleFuckingDying,fg5efk8,t1_fg5dcgk,1580525278.0,"Well they are also one of the most likely dog breeds to be raised to be aggressive or as a guard dog, so that makes sense. Hell I’ve met many, many more smaller dogs that are just naturally way more aggressive but they aren’t as powerful so they aren’t really dangerous. I’ve worked with dogs for a long time and Pitts when raised humanely are the sweetest little things. If you raise a dog to be aggressive than yea, they’ll be aggressive. Pit bulls by nature are not just aggressive dogs, especially if you neuter them."
MealPrepSunday,fg5borr,t1_fg56wwg,1580523272.0,Maybe put the lettuce on the bottom as a boundary layer then wrap the sandwiches individually in cling wrap to keep everything fresh?
