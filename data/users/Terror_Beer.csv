history,fe6ngi5,t3_enyxi8,1578897013.0,"No war ever has the 'right tactics"" because the tactics used are often behind on the situations but here goes. 

First off, the winning tactic is the one that sets all moral and ethic rules aside. Because not bombing city A because of reason 1 whilst there is military production is not efficient. (But luckily we are humans and often do think about the morality of war)

The easiest one to answer this question with is Germany. 
Had they used their submarines from day one as they started doing in 1916, I believe they could have seriously damaged the influence of the British and French armies. Maybe even enough to force Britain to concede to German hegemony on the mainland due to famine and other shortages. 
Second for the Germans is gas(insert bad ww2 joke here). Poison gas was already used by the Italians in Ethiopia and proven effective. They refrained from truly massive use because of moral appeals from the Allies. There was practically no defense so that is a very easy way to take out the enemy(and his horses)
Thirdly, aircraft. Russians had used this to a better extent but Germany had quite and airforce. Put 10% of the effort that they had in artillery into the new airforce and they could have been way more effective (hitting targets) and efficient(less bombs wasted is less industrial potential wasted)

AskHistorians,fe6lzqh,t3_enzodf,1578895422.0,"During Antiquity and the early Middle ages it was very common and even expected of a ruler. They were to lead by example and would be in the thick of it. Roughly three groups of rulers can be distinguished. 

Some rulers would show their presence on the battlefield with their banner and stay behind the lines to only organize the fight and see to it that all goes well. (Claim the credit from a safe location) They would often send their personal bodyguard into battle, this bodyguard would carry their banner and would often be the most elite unit on the field and could tip the balance.

Others would do nothing but fight , best example here is Alexander. He would use his cavalry to punch  a hole through the lines or to (hammer and anvil) completely destroy enemy  troops engaged with his infantry. 
These rulers truly lead by example but also have a very high turnover rate because of the risks(see Harold Godwinson at Hastings)

During the Late middle ages and beyond, the two provinces North- and South Holland were among the most wealthy of the lot. They led the Uprising against the Spanish and were the seat of power for the Stadtholder. 

For a long time, 'Holland"" was the economic and political centre of the Low Countries(current Netherlands - Belgium - Luxembourg). 

After the Dutch Uprising more provinces ascended the economical and political ladder. And even more did so after the Napoleonic wars and Industrial Revolution. 

The current Netherlands are a state since roughly 1830 when Belgium secceded, and 1848 when the current constitution was written and the king gave up a lot of his power.

For ten of the twelve provinces, 'Holland"" refers only to those two provinces by the sea. Whilst 'The Netherlands"" covers us all.
