When I finally dropped off the order I apologized to the guy and said it was a confusing place. He says it was very confusing. So I’m thinking, shouldn’t you give good instructions to your driver up front then? And a gate code?

It really pisses me off when I try to share the things I struggle with and they feed me that bullshit or just say nothing at all.

Depression is probably the worst ailment a person can have because there’s just no support system at all. Fucking sucks."

doordash,fewfr1a,t3_eqr7j0,1579409847.0,"Yeah I had something similar happen to me tonight. I get an order for a local Asian place with the drop off a quick mile down the road. I arrive at the customer’s house and knock on the door. Lady inside looks out the window with a confused expression and when I held up the bag of food she shakes her head. I confirmed the address with her and she insists she didn’t order. So I go back to my car and call the customer to let them know that I was at the given address and no one there ordered. She was confused so she put her husband on the phone who proceeded to go through the whole thing again. 

After going back and forth we discovered that when they entered their address in the app, it was mostly correct, but instead of putting in “Dr” they put in “Ave”. Their address ended up being 14 miles away in a different city. I told him I was not able to deliver and to contact support.

I then proceed to contact support on my end to cancel when the customer starts blowing up my phone with texts, begging me to meet him halfway and he would have some cash or something. Support tells me the same thing while also saying customer couldn’t be refunded since the food was prepared and I was at the address on the app. He asks me if I could work with the customer to get his food to him. I said I couldn’t do that because my time and money are very valuable to me so he canceled the order with full pay. The customer in the meantime is still blowing up my phone. I finally told him to talk to a supervisor and the texts mercifully stopped.

At least I got some free food out of the mess."
