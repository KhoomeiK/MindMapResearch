Porn is really the modern day cigarettes, it's an addiction and it's still so new that it's the norm. Stay diligent and be aware of your thoughts when urges begin to arise, you got this man."

leaves,fecesmf,t3_eod8ps,1578972202.0,"I find that the best way to break the cycle is to do an act that shows that you are done. Smoking so that you have no more is just setting yourself up to wish you saved some for later, which quickly spirals into a trip to your friendly neighborhood drug dealer. However, by flushing it you set yourself up to remember that you've dedicated yourself to quitting, it gives you more motivation when those urges hit.

Really, if you were done with it (and not just telling yourself a story to further justify your use) you would just get rid of it. Because you've already decided that you were done with it. 

If you were trying to justify your use, however; you'd spend a lot of time thinking about the pros and cons, writing posts on reddit to get others opinions, and ultimately end up bargaining with yourself (negotiating a deal, ""such as this the last time"" or ""after I finish this last gram then I'll stop"") in order to justify continuing your use.

Really, quitting is a mindset. If you do things now that make it easier to continue sobriety, you'll be much more successful. But as long as you still look for ways to justify your use, you'll continue to do so even after you've ""decided"" to quit.

Not trying to be rude, just want to shed some light on the games that our ego plays. I wish you the best, good luck!"
Psychonaut,fec9r0l,t3_eodgm2,1578969182.0,"Terrance McKenna (very popular for his popularization of psychedelic drugs) said that the best way to get the most out of cannabis was to go months at a time with out using it, and then consume as much as you possibly can.

Cannabis can be extremely spiritual, but day to day use reducing it's potency significantly. I find that after a long tolerance break, the high I get from weed doesn't compare to the high I get from daily smoke seshes. In the long run, day to day use is more a sign of escapism, but when used like a psychedelic substance (months in between trips) it's very spiritual and can provide insight on a lot of things.

Just don't over do it and end up falling asleep."

aspergers,feby0m5,t3_eock0y,1578964110.0,"For me, a job is just like school but with adults. 

Nobody wants to be there. There's multiple social groups. You have to listen to what your superior say or else you get in trouble. There's always those people who fuck around and do stupid shit. etc.

I find that it takes me about a month to open up and get comfortable with the people I work with to the point where I can have conversations with them besides the current task we're working on. After I open up and get comfortable it's very similar to highschool."
Buddhism,febmhov,t3_eocjb3,1578960410.0,"Well, after being striped of your ego the only explanation of the universe that makes any logical sense is that everything is one. I'm not sure if I would call this ""oneness"" empty, but it is consistent. It never changes.

aspergers,fe3r2jt,t3_enomxa,1578852053.0,"It's not strange, maybe they just don't care. Not trying to be rude, but just trying to look at the situation from a wider perspective. I have a long list of special interests, and while I love to listen to other's interests, sometimes I flat out could careless. I mostly show interest just because not being an asshole is cool, but I'm really focused on my own interests while they speak (unless what they are saying is really interesting.)

I'm sure you've found yourself in a situation where someone just wouldn't shut up about something, it's likely that this could be happening to you right now but with the roles reversed. Again, not attempting to be rude, but just making an observation based off of what you provided in your post."
