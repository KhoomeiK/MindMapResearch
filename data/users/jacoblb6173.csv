Or that the crests looked terrible monochrome. 

A lot of people didn’t like the Caps SS when they came out but now there is an ISO for it once a week.

That being said, I take the wrap off and clean with plenty of water and a good neutral soap as soon as I get home. Treat it like a good burn or severe sunburn. I’ll put a very light layer of aquaphor on it, washing clean with neutral soap and plenty of fresh water at a minimum ever 12 hours then reapplying aquaphor. Do that for maybe three days until it’s dry to the touch and scabbed over, there is a thin skin layer healed over it. Then apply a good skin moisturizer to help it heal.
