It has nothing to do with the scientific use. I get it you think babies being murdered is bad but that is your subjective opinion. Would it be bad for many of the animals being slaughtered by humans if babies were murdered? Many animal species would thrive in the absence of humanity. It could be good for those animals. If your to say it is objectively bad you are misunderstanding what the word means and I think you are using it improperly. I find no such indication that anyone uses the word in the way you do so to say that is how it is used colloquially I find odd even more so if they did that it would conflict what the word means. Art is a subjective experience and It is just as valid to believe a 3 year olds drawing is better than Picasso’s.

todayilearned,ff7atcv,t1_ff74bwv,1579644926.0,I’m not sure what you mean your use of objective contradicts the meaning of the word
AskReddit,ff7ah1f,t3_es0ix0,1579644630.0,"I guess I didn’t Ask the question right but without the head being submersed so your able to breath  What are the notable changes to organs and the body?  Are their any studies that have looked for an answer ? Say you have air in a bottle and u put that bottle in water you will notice  the air floats to the top 
Would oxygenated blood or lungs have a similar effect

I have heard lymphatic drainage is circulated much faster 
Anybody?"
