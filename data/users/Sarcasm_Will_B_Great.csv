Weapons.  Hunting.  Buts that’s just who he is.  There are plenty of people on the left who are into the same things.  I mean here on reddit there is r/liberal gunowners and r/socialistRA  (socialist rifle association) there is a show on Netflix call meat eater, Joe Rogan did an episode but the main person on the show is a dude that grew up on the land and talks about respect for the animal and that if you eat meat you should know the process. 

Shit Karl Marx is pro armed citizens to protect them self’s from bourgeoisie.
