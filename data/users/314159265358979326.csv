This is a very slippery stat.  The figure you're referring to is:

>80% of Soviet males born in 1925 did not make it to 1946

which is very misleading as most people read the fact.  While living in the USSR during WW2 was undoubtedly one of the worst existences in the history of humanity, 80% of Soviet males born in 1925 were NOT killed in WW2.

First, there's infant mortality in a shithole country.

Then there's holomodor.

Then there's a general shortage of food even outside mass famines, and regular illnesses outside of infant mortality.

And purges!

Then WW2.
