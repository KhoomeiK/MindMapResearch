me_irl,ffssuav,t1_ffsi9us,1580191197.0,a while back i looked through the window on my pc tower and noticed my cpu fan wasn’t turning. i had to buy a new one and replace it which wasn’t bad because they’re cheap and easy to swap out. what bothered me more was how long it might’ve been broken while i was oblivious to it and using my pc as normal. i can’t even remember what made me check through the tower window. i think i could tell my pc was producing less sound? idk but i kept thinking damn what if i hadn’t randomly looked through that pane and noticed the heat sink fan not turning..

videos,ff7k488,t1_ff7ilxh,1579651436.0,good one. she “flipped” before he broke up with her and before she started telling people he hit her. maybe you’re just making an easy joke but if not you need to seriously check yourself. i know how it went down. the 3 of us would hang out often and we were close friends (he’s still one of my best friends. in fact we’re about to move into an apartment together). me and her would hang out on our own too. she changed. something changed. him and her mom tried to get her to go to therapy but she refused. it only got worse and at one point she kicked out her mom’s windshield while she was driving. i’ve had ex’s tell lies about me before. i’ve seen my friend’s ex’s lie about them. people lie. and people are especially inclined to lie and do hurtful things when they’ve just been broken up with. nothing i say can convince some redditor what is the truth but i know that he never hit her.

videos,ff7evk4,t1_ff72nya,1579647941.0,something similar happened to my friend in high school. it was really upsetting for him to have their mutual friends ask if it was true that he hit her. of course it wasn’t. she said a lot of nasty things about him but truth be told the relationship ended entirely because of her. she lost her damn mind and he had no choice but to break up with her. she still talks about him whenever i see her and you can tell she’s not moved on. we used to be friends too. it was sad to see her go so crazy. i think it was a legitimate mental health issue that arose around that time. it was like a flip switched and she just wasn’t the same person anymore.

Whatcouldgowrong,fdx9jrl,t1_fdwyzdn,1578766645.0,it was an accident because she was messing with it. iirc she pulled it out of her purse to show her friends because it was a pocket pepper spray in a “cute” pink case. somehow it went off for just a split second and it was enough to clear the room. me and my buddy were furthest from her along with the teacher and we watched as it spread through the room and forced everyone to run out into the hall. she was suspended for having a weapon (it’s considered a weapon and not allowed on school campus). the fact that she discharged it and caused our entire class to flee into the halls made it so our teacher basically had to tell administrators and get her suspended. i think it was just 1 maybe 2 days.
