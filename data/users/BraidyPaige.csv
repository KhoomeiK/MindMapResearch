ChoosingBeggars,ff2r4s5,t1_ff2cqd9,1579520346.0,Just ask for the second teabag on the side. It’s what I do!
unpopularopinion,ff2q2d9,t1_ff2p7xr,1579518780.0,"Of course I wouldn’t apply that thinking to myself: my dog isn’t a human. I love my dog and I want what’s best for him, but he is my property and doesn’t have the same rights and privileges as another human does."
AskHistorians,feo8x40,t1_fenyo2n,1579296718.0,"I really don’t think it will have any impact on the sub at all. You seem to think that the majority of users will think you assigning a flair will be the mod team saying that an answer is 100% correct; however, how does a flair differ at all from what you already do with the heavy moderation? 

You as a team are already deciding which answers are and aren’t acceptable. Might as well flair them so the community can be easily aware of it too."
AskHistorians,feo6oc9,t1_fenyvi4,1579295869.0,"I really think the impact on the moderation process is just semantics at this point. Maybe one person will be confused, but thousands of others would find the change incredibly helpful."
AskHistorians,fenxuwh,t1_fenwnhs,1579292450.0,"What I am saying is this: you already evaluate every comment on this sub to determine if the replies are high quality enough to stay. Once you decide that a question has a high quality answer, you would simply assign a flair. The flair would not need to imply that the answer is 100% correct and that every single one of you agree with it, but it would let people know at a glance that the question has received at least one answer worth reading. 

You guys decide this already when answers are finally accepted. Why you refuse to flair posts once this occurs will forever baffle me. You have all made it exceptionally clear that you are not open to change, even though a huge portion of the user base is asking you for them."
AskHistorians,fenwepf,t1_fenvclh,1579291847.0,But it really wouldn’t. All you would have to do is add a flair once you’ve approved the comments that says ‘Answers Available’. You wouldn’t need to evaluate the answer at all; just let people know there is one on the post. That would let users know there is an answer there are would probably add a total of 15 seconds to your time spent on a post.
AskHistorians,fenm0wg,t1_fenje5o,1579287564.0,Exactly. My interpretation is the mods just don’t want to do something because they are lazy about it. Simple as that.
todayilearned,femn8tr,t1_fem34r5,1579263450.0,"Dude. It is completely fake. You can easily verify that. And people that can’t afford transplants get them all the time. The US has its problems, but the poor having organs bought out from under them is not one of the problems."

Sneakers,fel84mk,t1_fel78rb,1579216120.0,"They are a beautiful shoe. I am going to see if I can get my hands on a pair! I’m glad to hear they’re comfy. Too many times I see some that I love and when I put them on, they just feel awful."

Sneakers,fel5dur,t3_epqyj9,1579214422.0,Hi everyone! I saw someone wearing this pair of sneakers today and I fell in love. Would anyone of you happen to be able to ID this Nike model?
HistoryMemes,fei8jk9,t1_fei892g,1579132670.0,"If I am reading your subtext in your first comment correctly, you were alluding to the current Iran situation. Isn’t an embassy considered US soil, and therefore and attack there wouldn’t require the House’s approval to retaliate?"
europeanunion,fei8drm,t1_fei7v21,1579132566.0,I have not heard anything about that. Can you elaborate? The last real cable change Apple made that I am aware of was the lightning port in 2012 and then giving iPad pros usb-c connections in 2018.
HistoryMemes,fei88ck,t1_fehkokh,1579132470.0,That was a really great video! Thank you for sharing.
HistoryMemes,fei7b9m,t1_fei5uo4,1579131886.0,"From why I’ve read on this thread, the British eventually told someone high up in the US government and it kinda trickled down from there."
HistoryMemes,fei6swf,t1_fehukcp,1579131558.0,"Well, correct me if I am wrong, but if Mexico had attacked, say, El Paso, TX, the President wouldn’t have needed to ask the House for a declaration of war."
europeanunion,fei0350,t1_fehzp9c,1579127379.0,When? Do you mean the Lightning cable?
europeanunion,fehz2y5,t1_fehxjhw,1579126774.0,"And if Apple is forced to change their ports, there will be even more unusable ports. I alone probably have 5 Apple lightning port cables plugged in at my house. I and every other Apple consumer in the world would be forced to throw away all of these and buy new to upgrade our Apple products."
europeanunion,fehy3uf,t1_fehpdea,1579126189.0,How would this reduce the number of plastics? Every phone already needs a charging cord. This is just the EU sticking their noses where they don’t belong.
finance,feghuk5,t1_fegd749,1579093236.0,"And they, of course, don’t use plastic or any electronics made out of rare earth metals. They actually have a carrier pigeon system set up to post on reddit. It’s very environmentally sound."
nextfuckinglevel,fefh3dw,t1_fefc1bw,1579056188.0,"There’s a really cool, super innovative invention called sunglasses that will actually protect your eyes from the sunlight. I know they are a pretty niche thing, but I am sure if you asked around you might find a store or two that sells them."

TrueOffMyChest,fed817f,t1_fe7dqye,1579003113.0,"I think a lot of people don’t realize this. If you get no tips for an evening, it is up to your employer to make sure you made minimum wage."
rareinsults,fe625vs,t1_fe5w97f,1578880098.0,"No. It wouldn’t. Murdered by Words is supposed to be examples of verbose and thorough destruction of one person by another, not witty one liners."
financialindependence,fe41i6p,t1_fe3fv00,1578854890.0,"Why not keep working then? I don’t really understand the mentality that you have to retire once you hit your FI numbers. If you enjoy working so much, don’t let yourself get caught up thinking you have to retire."
financialindependence,fe409rt,t1_fe3bjza,1578854577.0,"Or, the OP can keep working and enjoy that part of their identity. There is no reason to retire if you enjoy your work and want to continue it."

facepalm,fdhpley,t1_fdgstet,1578427635.0,"Hush now, you are being rational in the middle of a violent circlejerk. It is best to retreat and just watch the madness from behind a shatter-proof glass window. 

Those that view sheep as exploited probably feel the same about working dogs. It’s best not to get too close to the insanity as it might start affecting you."
AskReddit,fdhk5qu,t1_fdg5oty,1578424365.0,"It is actually a fairytale, and the little piggy did, in fact, go to market. He is the oldest brother, I believe, of a family of pigs and the most responsible one, so mamma pig trusts him to go to the market. 

The piggy that cries ‘wee wee wee’ all the way home was a misbehaving piggy that got beaten with a switch.

elonmusk,fcgp9l3,t1_fcgcbfl,1577642619.0,"Now, I am not a mechanical engineer, however I have always thought it had to do with the torque. The farther away from a force you are, the more torque the force applies to you. In earthquakes, buildings, especially tall ones, feel the effects of this by experiencing extreme shaking and movement. 

In addition, an underground structure would be protected by the stresses of the rock surrounding it. A structure in the air only has the force of gravity acting on it. And underground structure not only has gravity, but the mass of the ground above it as well as the stresses of the surrounding rock to counteract the force of the earthquake. 

Again. Not a mechanical engineer, so what I say could be wrong, but this makes sense in my head from a force diagram perspective."

Think about it, you are the only person he knows in this group, and you are not going to be able to pay attention to him all the time. So now, he is going to be stuck in awkward conversations with people he barely knows, or worse, excluded while you are catching up with your old friends. 

His friends should be invited. It will be great! I don't think you are being malicious, but YTA here, unfortunately."
