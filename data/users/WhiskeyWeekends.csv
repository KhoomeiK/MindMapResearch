It wasn't a Reddit thing but a program directly through their website. I can't remember the question I asked, but essentially the writer told me that Hollywood goes through trends. That's why we're in the period of remakes. That's why zombies were such a huge thing in the early 2010s. That's why there were so many YA novels being turned into movies. Blah blah blah, remakes and sequels are so hot right now, essentially. That's why IT and Stranger Things and nostalgia movies exist. 80s remakes are so interesting, according to the public.

1) You're ignoring what I said.

2) They associated colors, not skin colors. You know, the whole point of my argument?

>So, yeah, you didnt read the study, you just *imagined* that you knew what it was about, what it was saying, and how it was saying it.

I didn't imagine anything. The people doing the study had a hypothesis and applied their findings to their hypothesis.

>So I'll help you out fam. Let me copy and paste the important parts.

Lame.

>To start, i'll detail the actual experiment we're looking at here. They did what is called a *shooter bias* experiment, where, where participants were shown an image of either a person or a robot, either holding or not holding a gun. It was their job to decide, in a split second, whether or not to shoot the target. 

Ok. And?

>The goal was 1. To see if people ascribed race to robots (they did, read the study to see how)

No. They ascribed color. Not race. Did you read my comment? An inanimate object doesn't have race. It has color.

>and 2. To see if the participants were quicker to shoot unarmed black humans/robots than white humans/robots (they were, robots were basically indistinguishable from their human counterparts in the statistics).

They were quicker to see dark as a threat compared to light, which was my whole point. Not skin color.

>So, yeah, it turns out that people ascribe race to robots based on their coloration. 

No. That was the researchers' interpretation while ignoring that since caveman days, we've recognized dark as danger whereas light is safety. It's not race. It's human nature.

>This has a wide range of possibilities for the future as robots become more widespread and advanced, and is something we should probably study it further.

Would you want a bright red robot shooting flames bringing you tea while announcing at a hundred decibels ""HERE IS YOUR TEA, MASTER!!!""? That's be a little jarring, would it not?

>Tldr - just because you disagree with a studies findings doesnt actually invalidate the study

The study's findings being stupid does, though.

Tldr inanimate objects don't have race. They do have colors that people 100% do associate with emotion. Stop ignoring my argument for the sake your argument."

Black (the shade, not skin color) has always been associated with danger. Night time, rotten food, dangerous animals, ninjas, death, military weaponry, etc. It's seen as a horrible thing. Black widows, black ice,  bubonic plague (black death), etc.

White, on the other hand, is seen as purity/cleanliness. Snow, light, clouds, etc. Depictions of Angels, virginity (as a virtue), heaven, etc. These are good, pure things.

Colors like blue are seen as soothing or calm. Red indicates lust or rage. Yellow indicates calm, joy, or cowardice. Green is seen as natural. A non-green frog is a sure sign that it's poisonous.

Ignoring that, they went to the most ridiculous bullshit and claimed white robots are racist rather than the most logical response that people are ingrained to think that light means good and dark means bad, outside of skin color. It's a fucking ridiculous study.

Edit: Rereading your comment, I also want to address how they made the robots light brown and that was seen favorably.
