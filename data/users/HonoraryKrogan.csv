BreakUps,ffpp7zz,t1_ffpmq3p,1580100994.0,"I wasn't really making progress pre-NC, just masking the pain with the belief that through enough display of love and support, she would realize we could come back from our issues. I was taking every gesture or nice moment we had as a sign that I was succeeding. I was delusional, and it made every moment either an Everest high or Marianas Trench low.

NC devastated me, but once I got beyond the sadness and anger of re-opening that wound so soon after the original breakup, I was able to be honest with myself about why we failed, what was genuinely my fault, and how I'm no longer angry at her for what she did but that it's okay to be hurt by her behavior. I still have my bad days, but I am much more accepting and understanding of things. It's leaps and bounds better and healthier for me, probably both of us honestly."
BreakUps,ffplwwz,t3_euh8dg,1580098305.0,"A horrendous sinus infection derailed my plans, but the goals over the next month are to:

Organize my home and get rid of a bunch clutter.
Clean out my car.
Buy succulents and not kill them this time.
Get a weighted blanket.
Invest in new clothes and change up my style.
Start working out with a friend.
Pick up overtime at work and learn new areas of my department.

My breakup happened back in June 2019, and I unfortunately didn't go no-contact until September because I believed so much in reconciliation. I've made progress, mostly by reflecting on things, being honest with myself about why we failed, and diving into hobbies at home, but my new goals are more in line with where I want to be. They feel like a natural Step 2 into being a happier, healthier me."

AskReddit,ff8qdbz,t3_esa9p9,1579691675.0,"I grew up in a pretty conservative area and was raised Christian by my mother. I was making some cringy comments about abortion and wasted human potential until my mom told me about her abortion.

She found out she was pregnant again a few months after I was born. Knowing what I do of my father and how much we struggled when it was just Mom and I, it really changed my perspective as she told the story. If she had gone through with the pregnancy, she knew there was no way she could care for both of us and that someone was going to have to be put up for adoption. She knew how utterly fucked the adoption system is and elected to terminate the pregnancy instead of choosing which baby to force into a very uncertain life.

She asked if I thought less of her when she was done telling me her story; you could hear the grief in her voice. I told her no and completely re-evaluated my stance."

AskReddit,fejhai8,t3_ep25lu,1579174208.0,"I worked as a customer service representative for a cell phone company. It's the only job that's given me panic attacks and actively made my depression worse. I developed a drinking problem and had horrible attendance because in every call, I was personally responsible for every problem the customer was facing. I lost a $600 monthly bonus because I couldn't speak Spanish and the customer dropped the call before the transfer to the Spanish line completed. I was verbally abused because a father couldn't access his ex-wife's new account with her new husband to activate a phone for his daughter. I was surveyed by another employee at a store across the country who couldn't activate a phone on site, while a supervisor basically took over my station and headset in order to figure out the issue before transferring to another department. I was held personally responsible for the grandfather rules on unlimited data, the availability of the new iPhone around Christmas, and the company's utterly asinine deployment of 4G before it was ready for the marketplace.

The job was dogshit, only the shittiest supervisors were able to game the system to avoid the revolving door, and some asshole with a mullet would walk over and try to manually force you back into call-ready status if you weren't in tolerance.

My personal life suffered to the point where I spent all of my money on alcohol, food, and videogames, personal responsibilities be damned. I ended up moving away and recovering with family for awhile. I'm in a better place, in a better headspace, making more money than I ever could there. Of all the lessons life taught me, that place wasn't one I can say I really needed, because goddamn, I didn't. I didn't need to fall apart like that because of a shitty company and its perpetually shitty culture.

The only thing I'm glad I did was adding unlimited data to everything I could and throwing $30 credits at every little inconvenience."
