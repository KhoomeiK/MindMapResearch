And the truth is, nobody should have to feel that way. You don't need to feel this way. There are way more women out there who aren't size queens than there are men who don't prefer large breasts. You just happen to get a woman who openly talks about penises all the time. Quite frankly, it's strange, but she probably picked it up from her mother. If you don't feel comfortable, this will lead to resentment. Or at least, it did in my case. I just hurt all the time when I took my shirt off and I stopped wanting to be intimate because I felt ashamed of my body. If this is already messing with your intimacy, I don't know if it's going to slow down. 

I will say this: this is \*her\* issue, not yours. You could very well (if you're stronger than I am) start considering it something she wants but WHO CARE'S because it's a superficial preference.

relationships,fckdcef,t1_fckbe94,1577722787.0,Collecting images and videos is not a thought. It's an act. I hope that clears it up for you.
relationships,fcjjoh3,t3_ehh0ba,1577690272.0,"It's just really lame. Look, my boyfriend watches porn, I watch porn, big deal. But it's weird to be obsessive about it, and weird to drool over other people all the time, whether you've met them or not. But more than anything, it's just embarrassing for him that he broadcasts that stuff all over the place. I bet his friends think he's a complete goober for doing it. Do you really want to keep dating a dude that corny?"
relationships,fcjj5q0,t3_ehbqq2,1577689638.0,"Friend, please understand some of us like men who are not tall. My boyfriend is 5'7'' and I much prefer him to my tall ex. I like that he's closer to my height I can stand on my bare feet and kiss him without him having to bend over. Please please don't let the jerks online who are weirdly vocal about height make you think that there aren't women who prefer men under 6' tall. We exist. We're just not out there trying to make men we don't prefer feel bad. I'm not sure why anyone does that. 

Also, your gf obviously thinks you're attractive or she wouldn't have been with you for all this time."
AmItheAsshole,fcjh75r,t3_ehfwoo,1577687466.0,NTA. I don't know how people can be so cruel and deceptive. The Bible study is just the sh*t cherry on the sh*t hypocrite sunday.
AmItheAsshole,fcgrq7e,t3_eh7csf,1577643407.0,"I had a dress that was my go-to wedding guest dress. I got it at Anthropologie in their section specifically for wedding guests, and it was a greyish mauve color. I'd wear it with purple shoes and a light brown sweater, so it looked a little more mauve than grey. If worn it to two weddings and got nothing but compliments and then I wore it to a third. I guess it looks off-white in black and white photos and this caused a big stink with my then-boyfriend's sister who wasn't even at the wedding. People need to calm down about this stuff. It's well past ridiculous behavior from brides. NTA."
