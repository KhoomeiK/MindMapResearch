SuicideWatch,femicke,t1_femi9ni,1579257082.0,"The point I'm trying to make here is: Don't only think ""I want to be okay"", figure out stepping stones and a way to actually take you to that goal."
SuicideWatch,femi9ni,t3_epyl5z,1579256964.0,"You don't need a reason to feel bad.

It takes time to get better, there's just no easy solution or miracle technique that can change so much so easily. 

Change requires you to think and physically behave differently. Yes, services and hotlines are a great thing short-term, but they aren't the ones who will make you improve in the long run; That part is all up to your personal commitment (and for some, therapy)."
SuicideWatch,fegoxzq,t3_ep2vwb,1579099069.0,"That sounds like a really bad place to be, I can only promise you that it does get better when you move out.
I always hid my feelings, from everyone I know. Still do. Can't say it's something I'm proud of, but I'm still alive, for now at least.

I wouldn't assume that anyone would ignore it if you said you were going to kill yourself. From one pretender to another, it may be some weird kind of justification we make up, but really we know that's not the way it is.

You are not alone <3"
SuicideWatch,fegocwa,t3_ep2tcn,1579098648.0,"It's not too late to turn back. It's not set in stone. There is always hope out there somewhere, I hope you find it."
SuicideWatch,fego222,t1_fdzs63e,1579098432.0,"I feel you, I speak from experience when I say that it does get better when you get out of toxic places. You got this."
SuicideWatch,fduzzeq,t3_en5z7s,1578741464.0,Don't know what else to tell you besides that you'll eventually find life much easier without religious pressures keeping you down.
SuicideWatch,fduxtld,t1_fduxe7x,1578740726.0,"Then get searching. If you don't know where you're going you shouldn't wonder when you don't arrive.

""I want to be less sad"" is as much of an awful goal as saying ""I want to be stronger""  in fitness. It is too vague to actually take you anywhere. Concrete plans and definite milestones will serve you much better."
SuicideWatch,fduxb2m,t3_en5zl5,1578740448.0,"You never for a fact now what the future has in store for you. The person holding you back the most is yourself.


Do you have something to fight for?"
SuicideWatch,fduwn5n,t3_en61ew,1578740104.0,What about living alone? Is that an option for you?
SuicideWatch,fduwjs7,t1_fdt1n7p,1578740050.0,"But that's the issue; I don't want to be alive. It is not that stresses or anxieties or depressions make me want to kill myself, no, I have been thinking about how much better being dead is than being alive since I was six years old.

I'm trying to survive until the time is right."
SuicideWatch,fdsgcwe,t3_emxl8y,1578702181.0,I'd say being self-aware in a rational way and comparing that to who you want to be in order to set personal goals is a way.
SuicideWatch,fdsfeor,t3_emz0u0,1578701506.0,"You speak of your life like you are a passenger on a ship that takes you somewhere you don't want to be and you can't do anything about it.

You must realise that you are at the helm. Even if the seas are rough you need to stay strong and fight for something that is worth it.

You are in control. Find out where you want to go, set a course and be as strong as you can."
SuicideWatch,fdse8ps,t3_emz5bd,1578700678.0,Because dying is easier than facing your demons.
SuicideWatch,fck99cq,t1_fcjew1r,1577720019.0,I'm not bootlicking fucking anyone
SuicideWatch,fcimc5i,t1_fcilwo0,1577664969.0,"But maybe that is only because you haven't tried it enough, yet. Try to find people with similar interest whether online or physical and if you show interest, they might just be interested in you as well."
SuicideWatch,fcilfuj,t1_fcil61m,1577664539.0,"""Were you born yesterday bruv in the land of unicorns and rainbows"" is a direct insult and it doesn't prove your point. Quite the opposite: If you actually had a point you would be able to express it in a civilized manner. I will end this chain here."
SuicideWatch,fcil3c4,t1_fcil1oi,1577664363.0,"*Not that it is going to be easy, but it's the right thing"
SuicideWatch,fcil1oi,t3_ehduk0,1577664339.0,I think you need to let go and get into real contact and real people.
SuicideWatch,fcikthp,t1_fci5jva,1577664228.0,Don't take your anger out on people trying to help in a mental health subreddit.
SuicideWatch,fcikpg0,t1_fci57qh,1577664176.0,You being unsatisfied with your personal situaiton has nothing to do with me and insulting people on a mental health subreddit is most inappropriate.
SuicideWatch,fch4c35,t3_eha0nv,1577647174.0,Have you moved away from your mother by now? Don't allow her to pull you into the same pit that she threw herself in..
SuicideWatch,fch3ne5,t3_eh9o5h,1577646943.0,"You're not forced to work a 9 to 5. There are options. Even besides artists and high earning jobs there are other ways of living, such as self-sustaining lifestyles.

But let me make this clear: You will, in all likeliness, have to work. How, when and in which field you work and whether you will work on things that you are passionate about or not is mostly up to you, probably more than you think."
SuicideWatch,fch22xo,t3_eh9um5,1577646540.0,"I'm not sure what you can do to resolve your situation, but I'm sure your death would haunt your mother more than anything before and might even make her cling more to the abusive man, when he's all she has left.

Maybe you should talk more to your mother and tell her how you feel about him and the situation."
SuicideWatch,fch198y,t1_fcgu5nw,1577646257.0,"Indeed, I personally have troubles of a more permanent nature, so a forever solution for a forever problem seems rather inviting."
SuicideWatch,fcghrru,t1_fcggsyo,1577640194.0,"No worries, I suppose I should have mentioned that."
SuicideWatch,fcfz5ih,t1_fce46sa,1577635079.0,"I agree, it is not a very meaningful saying and I would never use it when trying to help someone. 

It is one of those ""Oh look at me I am so informed on how to stop people from doing the big bad""-sayings."
SuicideWatch,fcfyh0w,t1_fce0s92,1577634832.0,It's not. I don't even agree with it.
SuicideWatch,fcdw2st,t1_fcdivlo,1577614382.0,"I didn't invent the saying, I just elaborated it's original meaning."
SuicideWatch,fcbejo5,t1_fcb9vb1,1577585894.0,"Then that's the first person to talk to, especially if you don't want to be open about your problems."
SuicideWatch,fcb2rrc,t1_fcb242d,1577581550.0,"If social contact is what you need there are plenty of things you can do. Hobbies are a great way to connect to people. The internet provides open communities. However it is up to you to actually go ahead and approach people. I know that can be hard, but it is something that can be learned."
SuicideWatch,fcb1ty8,t3_egyxkc,1577581078.0,"There's always a reason why. Think, has some event occured that greatly influenced you? How about your mental health?"
SuicideWatch,fcb198h,t3_egz1z3,1577580726.0,Does your school have a counselor?
SuicideWatch,fcb172h,t1_fcb0gam,1577580688.0,"It's not an easy thing, but you'll have to figure out where you currently are and where you want to be. 

If you don't know where you're headed, you shouldn't wonder when you don't arrive."
SuicideWatch,fcb0iwg,t3_egyqu8,1577580267.0,"You can always reach out to people. Sharing pain makes it easier to bear. And if you can't take physical contact, maybe internet forums like discord servers can serve as a supplement for a while. There are even such networks that are dedicated to helping people like you."
SuicideWatch,fcaztth,t3_egye64,1577579872.0,Why don't you want to be a part of things?
SuicideWatch,fcazprc,t1_fcayqmx,1577579809.0,"Well everyone is searching for the point, aren't we all? Some find their purpose sooner or later, some find the answer in searching. 

If you'd care to hear my view, there is no point in anything. If you stop looking for something that cannot be found you will eventually find great freedom in this world."
SuicideWatch,fcay1d1,t3_egyeqz,1577578863.0,"The point is that it is a forever decision. Your temporary problems will end one day, but if you killed yourself you could never experience the good that would have come after.

Unfortunately this doesn't apply to people with more permanent problems."
SuicideWatch,fcaxm7n,t3_egyjzc,1577578628.0,Nothing as annoying as waking up in the morning realizing you're still alive.
