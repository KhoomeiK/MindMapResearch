A) It's nice to see the homes from 2003's ""Cat int he Hat"" get some screen time again!  
B) What an unfortunate name Imogen Poots must have been in school..  


Otherwise, this movie looks weird and a pass for me."

AskReddit,ff2xnxs,t3_er9gj0,1579527910.0,"It is the 'polite' answer..  Admitting that overpopulation is an issue acknowledges a problem that doesn't have a clear solution, outside of unethical approaches.  Mass Effect (game) comes to mind, where a species became warmongers and reproduced to quickly, secretly, they were exposed to a chemical that effectively made them sterile.  I could easily foresee a dystopian future where the next 'Hitler' isn't using gas chambers as ethnic cleansing, but instead, a government could simply (and even secretly) prevent a group of people from being able to reproduce."

worldnews,fdkqoi9,t1_fdkezah,1578509148.0,"In my head, I just imagine there are quite a few radical Iranians with access to quite large artillery.   Upon hearing the news that there will be/are currently attacks on Iraq, I could easily see one of 'said' nutjobs launching an RPG/Seeker at the first flying things with lights they see.  No different than local 'looters' taking an open opportunity of a protest to vandalize and steal..

I personally don't think Iran would be dumb enough to intentionally (or in a manner that could identify them as the culprit) shoot down a civilian plane, bringing the wrath of several nations upon them, I think (IF the plane were shot down), it was probably done so by a radical with access to a large weapon."
