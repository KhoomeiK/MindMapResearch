AskReddit,fdx45gd,t1_fdvvj2b,1578765129.0,"My friend still brings up my method of beating the Yiga Clan stealth mission in Zelda Breath of the Wild.

For context, a single hit sort of resets you to the beginning. I managed to use the bomb runes while running around to slowly kill every single yiga clan member in that stealth section rather than sneaking around. (I just don't like stealth missions) My friend sat there watching my method, shaking his head. It was the moment he truly understood that I don't like stealth games"

Fun thing, and my favorite to do. The bird hat on Amara (probably works for the others but I've only played Amara so I don't know for sure) is goddamn LUMINOUS with the neon skin. The entire head is just a neon beacon."

HumansBeingBros,fdqi6w8,t1_fdqgym8,1578667287.0,Maybe the bouncer had her take them off? Otherwise yeah definitely more than a little boundary-pushing there. Though I suppose he may not want vomit all over his spare bedroom sheets
YouShouldKnow,fdhc6jt,t1_fdh4k8p,1578419766.0,Closest theory on why I've had it explained for why it works is a reflexive vasoconstriction (you have certain nerve points in your feet that connect to different parts of your body) so in this case it works to cause the capillaries in the nostril to constrict and stop the bleeding
YouShouldKnow,fdgudws,t1_fdgezgm,1578408563.0,"I wrote this in another comment but if your nose bleeds every other day I feel like you need to hear it too so I'll type the trick I learned here too.

Whatever nostril you're bleeding from, stomp the opposite side heel on the ground 5 or so times (more if it doesn't stop). It *should* stop the bleeding, though if you reach 10 stomps the bleed might be too bad or something? Idk it's black magic I learned from an Athletic Trainer friend of mine. She's used it with her athletes to great effect so far, and I've tried it once or twice and it's worked for me."
YouShouldKnow,fdgu3cz,t3_el86o3,1578408352.0,"It's a bit late so idk if this comment will get any traction but: weird nosebleed solution

Whatever nostril the blood is coming from, stomp your opposite heel 5 or so times (more if you need to). The bleeding will stop basically instantly. 

Learned this trick from a friend of mine who is an Athletic Trainer, she uses it whenever any of her athletes get a nosebleed."

I recommend you check out Caveblazers if you like Roguelike games! Blazing Beaks is another fun roguelike and Noita is a new one with some fun mechanics to it. If you like a roguelike that plays more like a third person shooter though, look into Risk of Rain 2. It's also a lot of fun (can you tell I like Roguelikes?)

Also, I'd want My Time In Portia

And thank you for doing this, it's very kind :)"
RandomActsOfGaming,fc7n0s4,t3_egex04,1577512860.0,"I'd love either Heroes of Hammerwatch or Slay the Spire. Both look like really fun games.

Thanks for doing this it's really cool of you :)"
