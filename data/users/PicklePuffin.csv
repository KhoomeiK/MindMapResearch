DarkSouls2,ffvwk3d,t1_ffvv24m,1580275444.0,"Precisely so. If you enjoyed 3, 1 remastered is definitely worth it. I just replayed it a month or two ago and had a really good time. I can't enjoy a replay of most older games, for what it's worth. It doesn't feel dated.

Frankly, even Demon Souls holds up in its own way- although I think they shut off the servers recently so you'll be running solo through a VERY hard game.

Don't know if you've played bloodborne, but I would even pick that first if you haven't, as long as you don't mind slightly quicker combat. It's an all-time favorite for me. Everyone is a little different though. I've heard some who don't prefer it but it's my favorite of the bunch."

3 is a smooth experience, for sure, but I don't necessarily feel that it outshines the others by much. I'd rank it 1, 3, 2 or 3, 1, 2 depending upon what is most important to you. But I don't think 2 is bad at all.

It's a major challenge to have several good seasons worth of writing, get it carried out, and then call it a day. I can't think of a good example off the top. Usually either trails off or gets cancelled.

Even something like GoT, where most of the writing was already done for them, can end up in a colossal titty fart.

WatchPeopleDieInside,ffv4kph,t1_fftx3qw,1580255527.0,"The issue is (and I agree with you, considering that this fellow could be innocent-that's unknown), once he had been sentenced guilty, he's not doing himself any favors by making this sort of statement. 

Under our legal system, you can't even be paroled when sentenced guilty unless you admit guilt, and show sufficient remorse. Parole implies admission of guilt.

This is obviously an issue when an innocent person is judged as guilty. 

Your options are either- admit guilt for a crime you were innocent of, or appeal. 

Both are difficult options. In the latter, you may not even be approved for an appeal, depending on your resources, etc.

It's actually pretty fucked, because of course, the people with insufficient representation are the ones who get cornholed the worst.

Now, this gentleman may have been entirely guilty, and I don't know a single detail of his case. He certainly hasn't done himself any favors with his face tattoos- meaning no judgement, but it's not a look that shouts 'responsible choices'"

todayilearned,ffssd2l,t1_ffsqoyr,1580190707.0,"Well, I would say that's a great attitude, and I hope you keep it. You'll see some older folks who have become steadfast and 'equanimous;' happy with what is, and certainly some who... haven't.

I suppose the conditions for happiness and awe exist all around us- then perhaps the juice of living with a bit of pain at an advanced age is worth the proverbial squeeze.

Anyhow, cheers to you, and here's hoping that our conscious experience does somehow survive our biology, to see the wonder of everything in its fullness, as even a very long lifetime here isn't gonna do it."
todayilearned,ffsowkw,t1_ffso6xa,1580187477.0,"That's all fine and well, and I'm not arguing that we shouldn't be researching such things, but my point was meant as- have you ever actually been 80, or 90? Granted I haven't either... I'm 32 

At the current state of medical science, most of the old people I know say that it sucks to be old, and everything hurts.

If your belief is that your conscious experience disappears upon your biological expiration (which is by no stretch unreasonable), then perhaps you would want to press on as far as possible. I'm hardly an expert in this, but my understanding has been that many people are ready to go once they get to a very old age. Obviously that won't speak for everyone.

Anyhow, some people are researching the 'fountain of youth,' medically, in earnest. There are different opinions as far as how close it could be, or whether it is achievable period (though it's probably inarguable that we could extend our lifespans by some significant measure with the proper interventions).

strength_training,fficz1g,t3_etsv0z,1579970921.0,"You're probably okay. I would recommend training with 60% Max of normal weight for a few shoulder/upper days days, and very slow reps emphasizing concentric. This will help with healing by getting blood to the area. Do not do this if there is significant pain, however.

Pops can be a lot of things, not all are serious. I can't comment specifically on shoulder pops 

Do NOT keep pushing the weight if you are in pain, however. If you get a full blown shoulder injury, you'll be much worse off than if you had been patient for a week or two.

If you'd like to lose weight, fasted workouts work well.

Repeatedly blocking your SO is not a way to get on with someone. No healthy relationships involve blocking and unblocking your partner based on whims.

If you want, you can keep going through this, but please be assured that this is not the last time this will happen, once she deigns to unblock you. She's gotten permission to treat you like shit, and if you keep running back to her she'll up the ante next time

She's telling you loud and clear how she feels about you. You don't need to be forgive by her- you didn't do anything wrong (unless the account is misrepresented). Why would you be sorry? You said you had to go to bed early for a legitimate reason. She's twisting that to make you feel bad, consciously or otherwise, and you've written enough to show that this is a pattern.
