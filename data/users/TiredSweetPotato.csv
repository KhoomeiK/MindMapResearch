xxfitness,feltvqv,t1_felh5li,1579230814.0,"It's the most likely culprit because the wart was on a part of my finger that would have been in contact with the bar for pull-up negatives, but not for light weights or touching other surfaces. I usually wipe things down before touching them, but that bar was quite dirty, rusty and difficult to wipe. The pressure on my skin was also significant and broken skin is more succeptible to infection.

I try to avoid touching things outside too, like subway poles, door handles, etc."
xxfitness,fel98xj,t3_eprftz,1579216834.0,"I wipe down bars before and after using them. I'll always be extra thorough after I got a wart from a pull-up bar last year.

I wish everyone wiped all equipment, and if you have a wart PLEASE wear a band-aid or duct-tape or something to cover it up."

MadeOfStyrofoam,fejuapn,t3_epiv12,1579186010.0,"You can try approaching it like a free vacation and opportunity to focus on getting better. It really depends on why you were admitted though and what your mood is like. Are you calm/numb/""dead inside"" or are you nervous/angry/restless/anxious?"
DecidingToBeBetter,fejtt6i,t3_epi1z9,1579185689.0,"Have you seen a therapist specifically to address the trauma? I found that seeing a therapist for ""trauma reprocessing"" helped a lot with handling triggers and I don't get upset as easily."
xxfitness,fejti4n,t1_fegaymi,1579185473.0,"Thanks, I've gotten several opinions and everyone in medicine says the problems are mental health related or they don't know what they are.

I only recently found a psychotherapist that is trying to help with the physical stuff instead of just saying it's a medical problem and they don't know how to help, it's just a really slow process.

My iron levels are fine now but I still try to remember to take supplements because my levels could be higher and I have heavy periods."
xxfitness,fejsv8o,t1_fefr3pv,1579185021.0,"Yeah my mental health is kinda poor but I'm not too sure how to address it : /

Exercise is meant to help but any movement just leaves me exhausted.

I found a new therapist but I find that 1hr per week is reaaaaaaaally slow to see any improvement."

xxfitness,feexowm,t3_eosde8,1579043482.0,"I'm feeling frustrated that I keep getting weaker as time goes by instead of stronger. I can hardly walk to and from school anymore without getting exhausted, and exercise feels unachievable right now. I'm not sure how to get back into things when I can barely do the basics...

Just needed to vent."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fe6ni6b,t1_fe6n954,1578897064.0,"That's awful, is there any way you can get a new doctor?

I'm glad you called though to find out the exact details of the law re your situation."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fe653z8,t1_fe62oqx,1578881983.0,"Yeah they should be able to tell *other healthcare professionals*, not your parents. I hope you can sort this out.

Plus, usually, SH doesn't even reach the threshold for relaying the info to another healthcare provider."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fe4cd3r,t1_fe3whov,1578857797.0,"Thank you!

I really hope you can find a way to get better support too, I'm not sure what that would look like, but I really hope it can happen.

In the meantime, good luck this term <3"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fe3ut4g,t1_fe32uj4,1578853110.0,"Eeeek, yeah that really sucks.

Where are you from?

In Canada most, if not all, provinces will give grants & student loans for students with disabilities studying part time, since it's pretty common for a disability to interfere with your ability to do full-time work and/or studies. They also have disability grants, and the paperwork for both is really simple and any doctor can fill it out. I'm sorry if your country doesn't have that :("
MadeOfStyrofoam,fe31mji,t1_fe2zp23,1578845079.0,"Wouldn't medical leave be better than failing out though? Are you full-time or part-time? If you're full-time you should at least try going part-time, school isn't worth killing yourself over :("

MadeOfStyrofoam,fdi3opj,t1_fdi1uwd,1578435174.0,That's awesome! I feel like that could be so useful with the right clinician. I def struggle with executive functioning and stuff you need to do in life/responsibilities but I'm pretty good at emotional regulation now so traditional therapy is not that useful.

MadeOfStyrofoam,fdgth11,t3_ekyf1a,1578407902.0,"If anything, weed makes me feel less. It gives me derealization and the only ""emotion"" I feel more is anxiety.

Some people do find it extremely helpful though, and it's not a dangerous drug. Next time you smoke you should write a couple of sentences about your mood before, during and after the high, so you can better see if it's helpful or not"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fdgt5jp,t1_fde4bkm,1578407668.0,"You can always answer something like ""not at the moment, but I'm working on getting better."" It won't freak the person out and they'll feel less anxious about potentially missing warning signs."

medicine,fbx6ko0,t1_fbwenks,1577171573.0,"Eh... although I am also thankful for socialized medicine, the theme of the article is focused more on the physician ordering a battery of unnecessary tests in order to charge more from the insurance provider. Similar things can easily happen in countries with socialized/semi-socialized medicine depending on how physicians are paid (whether they are salaried, paid per visit, etc.)

The doctor waived the patient's portion of the bill, she knew it was ridiculous and never expected her patient to pay."
