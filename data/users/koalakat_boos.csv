And so began the love story of the century."

AskReddit,felt6gg,t3_epk5tm,1579230316.0,"Wooden floors and walls but like polished wood. Booths to the left and right as you enter, bar straight ahead. Bar wraps around to the left and right where it faces an open area on each side. Bar stools at each counter (left, right, and center). 

The open area to the left is full of high tables with booths up against all the walls. The right side area is identical but with short but long dining tables for families or otherwise coming to eat.

The joke encounter always happens at the center car counter as you enter. The bartender is almost always (stereotypically) cleaning a glass and most of the time, there are an assortment of other patrons dining and drinking."

Of course, with the masks strapped on, eventually CO2 would outweigh the oxygen and the body wouldn't have enough oxygen but hey, maybe that's what she wanted"

Traditionally the pastor would kick people in their seats as he walks up to start his sermon to make sure they were awake. Then, someone imitated him and now it's kind of a tradition. As you enter, you kick each pew on your way to your own. Extra points for kicking children.

Our organist will use her feet to play sometimes but we're not counting that as points or she would be winning by a long shot.

I think one of the deacons named Chris has the high score at my church. Something like 537 and he's been here a month. He's probably the most dedicated. 

The best time to see it is traditional weddings. Seeing the bride's feet appear every once in a while from under the dress just to smash some kid in the face is an event you'll never forget.
