I just always have the hair on the back of my neck stand up when people look for the cheapest way into archery in general. Am I suggesting you spend $1500 on one, not at all. But there are creature comforts you pay a small premium for, one that may be important to you is easy of cocking the bow per FSP the bow is capable of, meaning a brand name bow may have a lighter pullback and still achieve better velocity than something that was copied by a overseas manufacturer."

Hunting,ffejes0,t1_ffeixf9,1579850465.0,"Personal experience: I like to save money where I can but generally on stuff in this realm I am more of the buy once, cry once type. I bought a Hoyt compound bow. Knowing 100% that I would never dry fire my bow because they break if you do so obviously I would never do that..... the peep sight came out and cut half the string.   This is what could happen https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rB3_GO1QrSk
Hoyt tests all their components with 1000 dry fire test on a mechanical test rig. I got lucky nothing damaged other than the string. A cheaply made crossbow could have multiple times the potential energy stored in the limbs, cams, cables. When they go bang things come apart. Better manufactures use better components to make sure they survive the rigors of use. Again just my two cents. You shoot a Ruger American, would you trust a Chinese knock off to hold that 6.5 Creedmoor a few inches from your face?"

Let me ask you an honest question. Are you absolutely the best employee your company has? Do you work above and beyond your stated role, show up early/stay late, risk your life on the success or failure of the company. Or do you show up, punch clock, do enough to not get yelled at/fired. If the company fails do you personally lose anything, or can you go somewhere else and get a similar job?

I find it humorous that you use “dictatorial” describing your work place and then want to put the government in charge of every aspect of your life with the illusion of a voice in it. Your democratic socialism is just socialism which has a leader/ruling class that will make the decisions for you."

You may not like him on moral grounds, I don’t blame you, neither do I. I think he’s an clown for allowing bumpstocks to be banned. However if you want to own your own profitable business voting democrat in general is not going to help your cause. I know all the current candidates have big plans of how they are going to “redistribute” wealth. Those plans are patently false. You can not raise people up by dragging others down. Free markets have brought nearly the entire world out of poverty. If the plans of Bernie and Warren of “free” everything for everyone come to fruition the people at the top and the first to be taxed into the middle class will simply take their money and business to another country because they can afford it. So the taxes to pay for all the pie in the sky “free” stuff will fall to the middle class. I’ve been a small business owner for nearly a decade and I am here to tell you, I get to keep more of my money now than in ever have before.
