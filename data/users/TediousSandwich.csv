politics,ffcpnjs,t1_ffc9ouo,1579804557.0,"I had a long talk with my niece about this. It took me almost 3 hours to explain and show her what's happening. She was (maybe still is) a staunch Trump supporter. She knew NOTHING. They live in echo chambers. All of her friends, classmates, some of our family unfortunately, her church, all of them just stand around and echo their own sentiments. She didn't even stand a chance. When I finally laid out the facts to her, she was taken aback. She didn't even know any of it. When these people are completely surrounded by this disinformation it's almost impossible to escape until they see something that can at least pull them out.

It made me see it from a different perspective. This absolutely doesn't apply towards everyone at all, but it was mind blowing to me that she truly had never heard anything refuting her and even when she did, she was surrounded by ten people who could drown it out with their own version of facts.

I'm not making excuses for her though. I lived with the same family and self education is a must as well as seeking out information...just figured I'd give out that perspective. It is ones own responsibility to search for the truth. She's also 18 and impressionable and her church (my own views also not aligned there) loves trump because god only lives republicans just like it says in their bible."

but

From my own experience, if you can get to a point where YOU can be the one to stop contacting someone without telling them this, your life will get SO much better. I'm 31 and my ex and i broke up last year...it was KILLING me. All i thought about was contacting her and messaging her. I tried to figure out WHY i could not accept that this was just not supposed to be and i also wanted to figure out why i couldn't let go after they clearly didn't want my time. Then one night she texted me about 3 weeks after we broke up, and for the first time in my life i read it, deleted it, and moved on. It still hurt, it still sucked, but it was life changing for me. I realized that i was finally to a point where i wanted to seek out people who would give me the time of day and not just keep me on a string.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the unsolicited advice but this situation was so familiar to me i felt like i could feel what you're feeling. Until then, keep making good decisions like this for yourself. This is a sign of growth and self respect. 

&#x200B;

PS - Sorry one more. You don't HAVE to tell anyone why you're doing anything. Ever. You don't have to explain. ever. While communication is important...and if you were actually in a relationship with her id obviously advise against that but do whats best for you.

&#x200B;

(sorry if this seems like i'm not supporting your decision...i really do, i just wanted to share my own experience because it was so recent and that's all i have.)"
