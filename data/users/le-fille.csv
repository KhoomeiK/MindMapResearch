HumansBeingBros,fe7qoy8,t1_fe7j26r,1578918064.0,"And apparently you cannot wait till someone posts a comment like mine, attack it, and completely take it out of context. You can find someone else to spew your hatred at. As far as I'm concerned people like you should take more responsibility of the damage you do to the earth and all life on it. Maybe you should focus your time and energy on that instead of attacking someone who's just worried about what's happening right now."
AmItheAsshole,fe6yao5,t3_enriuc,1578907710.0,"I don't understand why some people say that making her stay indoors is the solution???? Most cats feel the best when they get to be outside, only some with traumatic experiences don't want to. If you raise them from birth to always be inside, then yes, they can be an indoor cat. However you take away something that's natural to them, and in my opinion at least, that sucks. Just because you want your cat indoors doesn't mean it's best for the animal? Besides, making an outdoor cat suddenly stay indoors all the time will indeed ruin her life. OP, you're absolutely right and also NTA."

DepressionRecovery,fe1rxem,t3_enkdz5,1578830240.0,"Congratulations on how far you've come! Maybe tell your friends about how you feel and how you're struggling with this, I'm sure they're more than willing to help you and ask you to hang out even  when you don't ask them as often. Actively choosing to do things that you know make you happier is also part of recovery. I know it's a bit scary but doing stuff that makes you a bit uncomfortable will help you a lot in the long run. Good luck and keep on going!"

cats,fdjsw4l,t1_fdjsgwz,1578486320.0,"Do you respond when she meows? Sometimes they make noises to say hello or to tell you something but the constant cries are usually just attention seeking. Try ignoring her when she does that. The more you give into that, the worse it becomes. Once she understands she won't get anything out of it, she'll stop. Also, do acknowledge her when she's quiet and give her treats for good behavior! That way she knows what's good and what's bad behavior. I assume you've googled it already but here's a [link](https://pets.webmd.com/cats/guide/cats-excessive-meowing) that might be helpful."
cats,fdjrxge,t3_elrn2r,1578485265.0,"Maybe she's bored and wants attention. Is she young? Try playing with her more and talk to her, they like that. If nothing else works maybe consider taking in another cat, young cats prefer the company. Good luck!"
