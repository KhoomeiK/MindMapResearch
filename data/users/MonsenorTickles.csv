He's basically the god of Abraham through the eyes of a third party monotheistic group. Yaldebaoth is still the creator of man, but he overestimates his power/place in the universe.

I don't think you're wrong (and not trying to argue against you), but I never got a ""power of friendship"" story so much as an importance of social trust. Your social links are confidants. Some of them you might call friends, and through their side stories you build some friendships, but I always got a ""band of brothers"" mindset. Your confidants are the family you build, and you earn mutual trust through side quests and their support made manifest through game bonuses. 

One thing I always loved about P5 is how thematically consistent it is, even when it's not obvious. Very early on you have this illusion of 4th wall breaking (Press x to sign the contract, the butterfly telling you ""this game is unfair"") that, in point of fact, aren't 4th wall breaks proper, but foreshadowing to the real antagonist and his ""game"" against humanity. By the end, if humanity is going to win, humanity needs to resist and such resistance can't happen alone. 

Among the themes of resistance, disobedience and the power fantasy of standing up to obvious systemic problems, the ultimate villain is us and our collective sloth.  

WAKE UP GET UP GET OUT THERE. 

The antagonists before the twist are people that actual stand against this sloth though. The catch is, they do it for their own ambitions. They stand up and try to make change by way of their own injustice and, upon defeat, return to the true enemy of a indifference. If indifference is going to be defeated, we need faith, confidence, in our fellow man that we aren't alone, and even where we aren't (or can't) fight the fight ourselves, need to be able to give that support where we can.

I can see where you're coming from, but I still disagree. For the record, I'm just a fan of animation in general. I like how animation (from Oswald the rabbit to video game cut scenes) can stretch the limits of visual storytelling. 

I suspect a lot of the commonalities in the anime aesthetic is a two fold of what the market expects and it's comparative ease in drawing. Most anime programs are adaptations from comic books (which are in turn influenced by one another aesthetically, with Dragon Ball being so goddamn influential I legitimately can't imagine modern series without its influence). There has been a noticeable drop in details in character design and I think we'd agree that there is a ""generic anime"" aesthetic that has become something wholly apart from where the industry was 20 years ago (I genuinely suspect part of the reason for JOJO's popularity is the return to designs and styles from the late 80s/90s, specifically contrasting what has become the generic (what's old is new again)). 

*That said*, what we're observing doesn't suggest rules on what animation should look like, but self imposed limitations of an industry that has grown more risk averse as studios consolidate (stop me when this sounds like every entertainment industry ever). The rules of anime are closer contrasted with pop music. Listen to enough of it, and you'll realize it's all the same, but that doesn't mean variety doesn't exist."
changemyview,ffclm6h,t1_ffcl04c,1579802067.0,"Agreed, but as somebody that despises anime exceptionalism (in a friendly way) there is a wide range of diversity within the same damn franchise, let alone genre.

changemyview,ffch0js,t3_esvjpn,1579799274.0,"""Anime"" is a Japanese term for animation. Anime programs are cartoons by any other name. This is not up for debate, but I'll yield there are cultural shifts in the loaded connotations of ""animation"" and how, in the west, ""anime"" suggests a different conceit than what would be conventional animation for the west.

That said, ""anime"" is not a genre. At best it's an aesthetic. Traditionally, anime has used fewer frames per second than western animation, helping to contribute to different aesthetic themes that have been refined over the years, but in an age of digital animation, it is a moot point with many western animation and anime studios animating to whatever rate they feel best helps their product. That is to say most anime uses 2-12 key images per second and runs at 24fps. This is the only mechanical thing that separates anime from ""conventional"" animation and is only continued today as a hold over from tradition, and not essential to all programs that have the ""anime"" aesthetic.

There are dozens of genres in anime, from slice of life to action, to comedy etc... In the west, the most commonly exported stuff is action heavy content specifically made and marketed towards teenagers (which is where most stereotypes of the aesthetic come from). In actuality, because ""anime"" is just animation by a regional name, there are scores of movies, shows and shorts that run the gamut to adult (not porn) content, to children's shows. They cover a wide range of art styles and can have about as much in common with each other as Arthur does from Southpark.

Despite what a lot of anime exceptionalist argue, such range does exist in western animation, it just has less market penetration than Japanese animation's domestic industry. A lot of modern animation has been heavily influenced by anime (which itself was heavily influenced by Disney), and a lot of these aesthetics are blurring. As I said earlier, the only technical factor that separates anime from other animation is the fps. There is nothing stopping somebody from America from taking something thought of as an anime aesthetic and building a story with western influence for western audience around it.

Anime is, absolutely, animation. At the core, reductionist, level, a flip book is animation. A gif is animation. Line pattern illusions (like what you'll find [here](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/633387417914345/)) are animation. Again, this is not up for debate. While the Japanese culture has contributed a unique thumb print to animation, the history of animation has always borrowed from and been influenced by what other studios (and cultures) have been doing. Even if anime ever was something wholly unique from other animation (it wasn't), it's influence on contemporary and future animation makes that distinction less and less relevant and makes your position less defensible by the day."

asoiaf,ffc6xqx,t3_esu3d5,1579792954.0,"The problems with season 7 and 8 didn't start over night. The rot was there for a while, but didn't surface until those seasons. 

For me, the problem started as far back as season 4 when the show gave us Ramsay's girlfriend for vaguely evil sex (because torturing people for fun wasn't evil enough, he needs to be into rough S&Mesque sex as well, otherwise we might not pick up on the fact that he's a deviant), the abysmal way they handled Shae set the course for how other characters would be handled when D&D decided to embellish their role, and the mishandling of Tysha left us with a Tyrion that had nothing to do but spout one liners and have other characters talk about how smart he was for 4 seasons. 

By season 5, episode one, we were going to more locations than ever before, but the world felt smaller for it. It's clear that D&D didn't really know where to take the new conflicts introduced in Feast and Dance which is why, literally, blowing up those plot threads (in a move that had next to no consequence for Cersie) just made everything Cersie did after seem redundant. 

Here's a strong independent Cersie, who don't need no Jaime, with absolute power and a strong ""so what?"" factor. Cersie's putzing for two seasons just makes the stakes seam kind of... lame. Part of the reason the last battle with the Others felt so disappointing is because that was the only real conflict we had left, and when that was over, all we were left with was a bunch of formalities and dramatic beats that were not appropriately set up at all. 

Speaking of the Others: from season 5 onward, things get really contrived, but nothing is more contrived to me than the Blue Eyes White Dragon. The series of arbitrary decisions that built up to that moment actively felt like, well, a series of arbitrary decisions that built up to that moment. It didn't feel earned. It felt more railroaded than a bad Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and really that sums up the last to seasons more than anything else: railroaded.

By failing to actually use the Martells, the Tyrells and Greyjoys as effective sources for conflict in seasons 5 and 6, (with lasting consequences) season 7 and 8 were hollow check boxes. Set piece after set piece to get us to where the story needed to go, but couldn't actually take itself because D&D were in over their head in writing it."
