SiliconValleyHBO,ffqeqf7,t1_ffq9q3t,1580132391.0,"Labor doesn’t inherently have value, you can go work you ass off digging ditches in the middle of the desert for 12 hours a day and no one will care. Labors value, or rather all value is determined by the price the buyer and provider agree on. You’re venturing into Marxist labor theory of value that postulates labor itself inherently has value. It doesn’t.

You can pick up anyone and I mean literally anyone who’s not disabled and they can pack boxes. There’s nothing special about what they do. Their market value is low because of that. Amazon assesses what they are worth to the company pays them 15/h, and if their value was actually higher, they’d go to other places that pay higher but they can’t because other places don’t think so. Contrast this with workers who have rare skills and being a lot of value (e.g. programmers) and then you’ll see companies actively compete with each other and try to pay the worker more and more to bring them to their company 

Now take what Bezos does. Literally no one can turn a bookstore to amazon. He led him company to where it is today. He’s work produces a lot of value and no one can redo his work. Same goes for lower level executives. They are paid well because they bring in money. Executive pay in fact is usually a small fraction of profits. Those executives can also move to different companies and get the same pay, because they produce a ton of value wherever they go. A box packer just packs boxes. Just like the box packer before them and box packer after them"

There are two components to teaching programming, one is learning how to script(algorithms fall under this) which is basically how to think in code, and is language agnostic. the other aspect is learning languages and their gotchas, which C is absolutely full of. When you start someone out in C they are learning both at the same time, and they get very confused. I got this dude trying to understand what objects are and suddenly he has to deal with null pointers? They get frustrated. I’d much rather teach the scripting aspect in python, and once they’re comfortable with that move them onto something like C and teach some CS stuff as they go. People who have been coding for a long time forget the times when they didn’t know the scripting aspect and think someone learning how to code is gonna have the same experience learning C as them, except they don’t, they get frustrated.
