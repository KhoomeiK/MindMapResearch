FloridaMan,ffvbez4,t1_ffuxdf8,1580260157.0,I don't recall saying they should update it. In fact I believe I said a ban wouldn't do anything.
memes,ffughjg,t1_ffu6pc0,1580241454.0,My thoughts exactly.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffso4xt,t1_ffqedtj,1580186815.0,Could be. I was not happy either way. Poor little guy's tummy woke me up 3x it was gurgling so much.
FloridaMan,ffsns5m,t1_ffsn7u6,1580186517.0,"All I'm saying is I don't believe the 2nd amendment necessarily allows a specific type of weapon. There are already weapons not allowed for general populations. Not saying I think AR should be banned, and if it were, it would hardly be solving any gun issues."
FloridaMan,ffsn4f6,t1_ffsmp5h,1580185971.0,"I want my Abrams tank. The 2nd amendment allows me to bear arms, without restriction. Not allowing me to possess a tank infringes on my rights."
FloridaMan,ffsmudf,t1_ffsmp5h,1580185742.0,Welcome to the world of false equivalencies!
FloridaMan,ffsmf6t,t1_ffsm24v,1580185401.0,The Bill of Rights guarantees one can own an AR-15? That must have been quite the foresight.
zelda,ffslt28,t1_ffsl56b,1580184923.0,My understanding is Philips had the license for the games because of the deal to make the SNES disc drive and that was about it.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffq6on1,t1_ffpvd5m,1580123399.0,My dad gave my dog a scoop of chocolate ice cream forgetting dogs can't do chocolate. Just a few licks gave him the runs for a whole day.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffq6kqd,t1_ffpu8mn,1580123235.0,My brother in law was born there. It is a Boston thing.
mildlyinteresting,ffpp7re,t3_euhsfs,1580100988.0,Where do baby legos come from?
ChoosingBeggars,ffhxk8o,t1_ffhvlzu,1579958277.0,This place... does it exist?
