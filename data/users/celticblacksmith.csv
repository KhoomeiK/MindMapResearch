It's not a matter of functionality, it's a matter of change in perspective. The boomers were a generation of framed photographs and canvas paintings and collecting China... Millenials seem to be drawn more towards both digital art as well as expression via unconventional music and tattoos. China is art. Much of it is hand crafted by artists in exotic places around the world and that creates a point of interest in the home.

GunsAreCool,ff6pelo,t1_ff641cf,1579632112.0,"""Brandishing"" is a legal term. I'm not sure of the specifics within the laws, but it basically means holding the firearm in an unholstered and/or combat ready fashion. Considering the rifles/SBRs/AR pistols are on sling systems and not at the ready, these people aren't brandishing. Otherwise, any police officer would be considered ""brandishing their side arm"" every time they put their duty belt on with a holstered pistol. Also, their rifles are most likely semi automatic, which would catagorize them as ""sporting rifles"" and not ""assault weapons"". Just clearing things up :)"

It comes in the form of friends and family and interesting interactions with other people. Besides the family dinner sunday, I have two friends who both saw me during my drinking days and both never gave up on me. One is coming over to apprentice under me in my forge (I'm a blacksmith, if the name didn't give it away lol), and the other is coming over to.... Get this.... Play monopoly. Both of us love the game and we both love military history. So she's gonna break in my WW2 monopoly set with me. When I was drinking, I would have thought getting together for monopoly was stupid. Now I just wanna have good ORGANIC fun. When you think of everything there is to do in this world, boredom is inexcusable.

And btw, after claiming you're not using a straw man argument, you confirmed that you're using a straw man argument by practically spelling out what it is. A straw man argument IS an extreme example, the only part you left out is that it's used in such an extreme in order to weaken someone else's argument so it's easier to take down.

But I'll play your game and go where you're accusing me of going... ""Feelings""

So setting aside all other arguments, lets take the case of the person who got this argument fired up. Before he deleted his comment, it stated that he's been on suboxone since 2007. So he's been chemically dependant on a ""different"" substance for almost 13 years now... How is the dependancy any different? How is depending on heroin considered addiction, but depending on suboxone considered recovery? Both are drugs (by definition) and both are maintaining a dependant state of the user to continue its use via addiction itself and ""feel good"" reactions in the brain. So whats the difference there?"
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fckrdef,t1_fckqo7j,1577731540.0,"Dude, suboxone is a synthetic version of the primary chemical in heroin. Therefor... It's just the artificial sweetener of the opiate world.

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fckqgud,t1_fckq49q,1577730982.0,"Dude, at this point, you're not trying to help anyone, you're just trying to be right. The argument that I bailed on because it was weak is the one you're focusing on. My point is that suboxone IS the drug that those who take it are saying they're sober from. Taking less of a substance (no matter how small that amount is) is not sobriety, by definition. End of story."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fckpmfb,t1_fckojgy,1577730462.0,"Dude I just gave one of many reasons, but the biggest reason why caffeine and cigarettes is different is because its not the drug itself.

I started out smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and drinking pop... Now I just smoke cigarettes and drink pop a lot. 2 habits left, both on the ""to quit"" list. Sounds like the road to recovery to me. Especially considering the pop and the cigarettes were around before I quite drinking, I'm dropping habits and not just rellacing or adding. Speaking of replacing...

An opiate addict jumps off street opiates and starts a fresh suboxone script... Nothing has changed. That addict is still addicted to an opiate. Status quo. How is that recovery? How is that sobriety?"
