You're moving into a community development that has a set of specific rules, which, for the most part, those that move there, do so because they desire such rules.

If you don't want to live in an HOA development, then don't fucking move there. It's as simple as that. It's not like HOA developments are the norm.

How exactly were banks predatory? They lend money for a risky commercial enterprise, and that enterprise either fails or succeeds. Is the bank to blame when such enterprises fail, and the bank wants to get back the asset they paid for so their bank doesn't collapse losing all their investors money?

The main reason banks got such bad reputations, revolves around people who took out loans on their land rather than selling it. Then when they no longer could afford to repay, the bank looks like the villain for seizing the asset the owner agreed to put up as collateral.

Now, let's talk about how certain government leaders forcing banks to relax lending guidelines so certain political parties can look good in the eyes of their voters, eventually creating a bubble collapsing an entire market."
