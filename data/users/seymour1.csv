conspiracy,ffvm77g,t1_ffvl578,1580267410.0,"Fox News and Breitbart had polls saying Hillary would most likely win. What you don’t seem to understand is that first of all polls are not exact, and second of all if something has a small percentage chance of happening, it can still happen. and based on the fact that Hillary won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, I’d say the polls were spot on. Trump won by a few thousand votes in three states. Also by the way this isn’t an anti or pro trump or Hillary post, it’s just the facts of the matter. Numbers don’t have a bias. Trump won the election fair and square, no reason to make things up about it."

It’s absolutely horrific and as more parts of the city get gentrified the area gets worse because the crime is squeezed in to the area. It’s not even really policed.

If he is removed as he should be in a functioning country, there would be no way to stop those involved from being held accountable. As it is now while Trump is in office there is no way to hold people like Bolton or Mulvaney accountable because it would just be litigated forever. The fish rots from the head. I mean do you honestly think the current DOJ headed by Trump lackey Barr will indict any of these people? The answer is no.

The only way to do that is impeachment. Everyone including republicans already know he did it, republicans aren’t even arguing the fact that he did. They just think it doesn’t matter. Impeachment lays the case out to the country. Litigating with the WH for years over Bolton would change nothing."

There is more than one way to achieve a goal. Point is that the American public deserves to know all the facts which the Dems are trying to make happen against nearly unanimous republican opposition.
politics,ffpjrmm,t1_ffpincz,1580096728.0,Bolton said he would testify if compelled. The WH would have tied it up in courts indefinitely therefore Bolton would not be compelled. Don’t make the mistake thinking Bolton is some kind of patriot. He’s been a far right war hawk and all around piece of shit since before most of us were even born. Expecting John fucking Bolton to ever do the right thing is an exercise in fiction. He will never go under oath about any of this but he will gladly profit off if it.
