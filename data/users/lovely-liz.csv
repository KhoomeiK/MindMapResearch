BingeEatingDisorder,fdl9vw2,t3_eln9rm,1578519536.0,"Basically you need to retrain your brain to have other coping mechanisms. You have to find what works best to distract you from the binging urges. For me I like knitting, playing video games, playing with fidget toys, taking a shower or bath, and reading."

WeightLossAdvice,fc8jaz7,t3_egnzsn,1577536119.0,"Keto and OMAD are fad diets that encourage restriction, and typically begin and end with intense binging for a lot of people. I would recommend reading Intuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Program that Works. It’s all about learning to listen to your body’s natural hunger cues and it’s also a great examination on why dieting doesn’t actually work. instead of changing how you eat for a few weeks it’s about changing your relationship with food as a whole. 
Also, if you binge a lot I would recommend talking to a doctor or perhaps a therapist specialized in binge eating disorder."
