The only reason America didn’t go into it sooner is because we have a past of 
Relatively strict isolationism and were just coming off the largest economic recession in history. GTFO of here with the “America Didn’t Know Nazis Were Bad”. Besides all that it wasn’t even like Britain was all set on declaring the Nazi’s bad, they still had apologists in the government up until the mid part of the war."
