Most GameStops I've been to don't even have those anti-theft tower things by the entrance.

The only thing that is comparable would be movies in most places but generally those are negligible as far as theft goes from what I can tell.

People mention the Toys R Us stuff about display cases and swapping them out but I've only ever bought two games from them and if memory serves, over a decade ago, it was free to grab the actual copy but it was in a closed off area with the security towers, similar to Barnes and Noble and their movie section.

TLDR: GameStop took the cheap option for security."

Games,feg34p8,t1_fefqf3c,1579074827.0,">I get that it’s likely involving theft prevention, but why didn’t they just keep sealed games in the back and fetch them when a customer brings the case up to buy that game?

If it were you, and be completely honest with me, if you had 100+ stores selling a product would you rather send 100+ display copies out to each store or would you rather they simply take one product out and use that? Now continue answering that question about 3-5 times a week every week. If you're answering the question properly you realize the latter is cheaper and the better option.

Also the opened copy serves as inventory so there's less picking up the case and being told they don't have it. Their return policy also protects you in the event it got damaged in that process, unless you buy a game and sit on it for 30 days before putting it in.

We can continue down the hole a bit more but I think we've made the point.

Also the employee renting bit is true but it's basically intended to help them be knowledgeable about a game. Again the return policy will protect you and hurt them if anything happens."
Games,feg2knr,t3_eov3tp,1579074156.0,"Let's go a different route with the comment.

I hate Walmart, despite being cheaper I'd rather buy a game somewhere else. Best Buy, at least my local one, has made a significant cut to their gaming section. Target... honestly I like them but I just never have a reason to be out that way. I despise Amazon, Walmart gets some business from me but Amazon I would rather not have the item at all than buy from them. I also hate the idea of purchasing digital and hate the push towards digital.

GameStop? Annoying at times but I'm at the point where it's mostly a painless experience. Varies from store to store but I've got one that I like and if I had my way they'd stay in business."
