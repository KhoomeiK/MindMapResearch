I’m **not** saying that we should accept everything that gets sold to us and not fight what we perceive as wrong, especially on social stuff (I do that all the time), but now that I, for all intent and purposes, left Tumblr, I feel like it became much more easier to choose what to keep and what to throw away, what to boycott and what to simply criticize. There are different levels of wrong. 

I'm generalizing, of course - not everyone us Tumblr feeds the echo chamber.

I advise you to be as much understanding as you can in this situation - don’t take what she said at heart because most certainly she didn’t mean it or even think it.

This DOES NOT mean that you should let it go without consequences. Your feelings are just as fundamental in this situation.

My advice is to call her and very calmly state that what she told you hurt you deeply, and that she *needs* to get help for everyone’s sake. Look up articles on caregivers burnout and the importance of therapy or support groups by resources you think she could trust and send her those *after* the conversation. Try not to lose your temper even if she does, not because you have to be kind to her but simply because it would be counterproductive. Chances are, once she’s herself again she’ll feel extremely guilty.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fg368w4,t3_ewkvra,1580471996.0,"I think it depends on the culture you belong to. My mom's ""lessons"" on food have almost always been positive, though I don't always agree with her.

Most of my friends had the same experience. This doesn't mean we're all fit (far from it) or that eating disorders are rare, but the root cause is usually not what our parents taught us regarding food and eating behaviour.

Generally, my country's relationship with food has been reasonable."
AskVet,fg0vdyg,t3_ew95xn,1580415772.0,"If you qualify, try to ask on RandomActsOfPetFood if someone can refill your supply of food, so that you can save for tests. It’s not ideal and I understand if you don’t want to, and it’s definitely not a long-term solution, but it might help just right now.

How much do the tests cost, individually?"
IAmA,fg0uhwq,t1_fg0sjxv,1580415272.0,Thank you! I asked because in a previous answer OP said that the SARS virus and this current coronavirus were 70% similar (horrible way to say it but I don't know what terms to use)

I think I still have the sax, too.

Does he wear bracelets? There are [climbing bracelets](https://www.etsy.com/listing/708697768/climbing-bracelet-climbing-carabiner?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=climbing&ref=sr_gallery-1-4&organic_search_click=1&pro=1&col=1) on Etsy that are pretty cute and can be personalized, too.

Alternatively, what about taking him out to dinner like he did for you at his favorite place? There's no danger of making him feel bad, and you could give him a nice birthday card, made by you or bought, like [1](https://www.etsy.com/listing/664786736/personalised-saxophone-birthday-card?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=sax+card&ref=sc_gallery-1-1&plkey=e6037f66a4637a9ff2c9a5e89eead5c2d8721ad3%3A664786736), [2](https://www.etsy.com/listing/770224137/rock-climbing-greeting-card-theres-no?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=climbing+card&ref=sr_gallery-1-3&organic_search_click=1), [3](https://www.etsy.com/listing/710136966/custom-wedding-climbing-print-greeting?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=wall+climbing+card&ref=sr_gallery-1-10&organic_search_click=1).
