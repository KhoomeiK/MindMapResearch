madlads,ffbjkbb,t1_ffbj5hk,1579768323.0,"It became obvious when they say ""it was a mannequin"", that was the reveal scene."
madlads,ffbj40n,t1_ffbhxli,1579767693.0,"That would give away the twist, it's a reverse heist story."
netflix,ffb8dv4,t1_ffb4q8u,1579754868.0,"Without looking at that, since it's a scene rip, I'm guessing it's a broadcast ad, I've seen em before. Nothing to be done about that other than waiting for DVD rips. So it's not that ""tv rips have popup ads"", it's that broadcasters do, and same day rips show what was aired."

ConvenientCop,ffa6ic6,t1_ff8rejx,1579728835.0,"It's destitute vs ""easy"" money. Plenty of South Africa & Brazil videos showing the same. Russia is pretty fuckered, I think a lot of people overlook it because it's north/white."

They're pretty great abstract strategy games. The standard sets are pretty nice coffee table wood sets, I've be able to pick up a few of em at thrift stores and give em as gifts."
