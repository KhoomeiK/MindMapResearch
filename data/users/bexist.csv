I'm sorry you went through this. I have the same feeling, which made it hard to go through physical therapy. I read somewhere that people who were abused don't know how to respond to any sort of touch, so it sometimes becomes a tickle sensation from nervousness about uncertainty. This is 100% me, and I flinch even when people move too fast or talk too loud. I had one friend say ""I forgot you're jumpy"" when someone said something loud nearby, and it really made me review everything about physical touch and other sensory stimuli.

Next time, feel free to tell her you were abused. More often than not, it explains to the person why I'm acting the way I am, and they usually respond kindly. If I ever meet a person who doesn't, that will be the last interaction I have with them. Plus, talking about it gives people a more accurate sense of our numbers and makes them think twice before saying things like that in the future to other survivors.

This sounds a lot like my toxic fam, except I recently realized I ended up ""the golden child."" My older half sister has apparently resented me for 30 years, and I had no idea until a few months ago. I know it may feel super hard right now, but most of this blame should be placed on your mother. My birthing unit painted a picture of our relationship to my sister to hurt her, and my sister saw what she wanted to see. Then she held onto that and let it drive her and our relationship for the next 30 years until I finally had enough of her toxicity and went no contact. I pity her. She let someone else completely control her. Birthing unit constantly plays everyone against each other, but my sister chose to honestly think that somehow I was being treated better than her, when in actuality I was abused and alone for my entire childhood. Yes, I got a cell phone in 8th grade, but it was so she could keep constant tabs on me during after school programs and sports (20+ missed calls regularly). Yes, I got a car for Christmas, but it was so she would have less responsibility (No more picking me up from events or church when I couldn't beg a ride home off someone). Yes, I went to summer camp, but it was so she could get rid of me for weeks at a time ($150 to pawn my kid off on the church? Hell yeh! Let's do every week!) 

I'm not saying your sister is blameless by any means, but I know in my case my sister was manipulated. She chose to be the person she is, and that's why I cut her out of my life, but that doesn't change that the real source of toxicity and hate and anger wasn't her. Don't let her manipulate you or have that kind of power over you. Don't let them drag you back in time and time again. One toxic fam member is bad, but having one trained by the other and willing to be part of the cycle is so much worse. It's in infinite feedback loop of terrible. Get out. Protect yourself.

CPTSD,fdx8u1p,t3_en98m8,1578766393.0,"Your physical pain is no doubt real. I recently came across a book that talked about how our fight response sometimes manifests by tensing your dominant shoulder and arm in prep for a literal fight. I was intensely relieved when I read that since I had shoulder surgery on my right shoulder at age 30 and everyone kept telling me I was way too young to be dealing with bursitis.

I have been NC with my birthing unit for almost 10 years and it is the best decision I ever made. I used to feel guilt for not giving her a chance, and then I realized I gave her a ridiculously large amount of chances. Her refusal to admit or even change her behavior is her problem, and it will not be made mine.

Youre doing the right thing. Stay strong and don't let other people tell you how should feel or what you should do about it. üíú Being family is not an excuse to be toxic. Hurting is not an excuse to hurt others."
CPTSD,fdx687i,t3_en9o25,1578765709.0,"I was my birthing unit's partner in every way except one. Starting at 9, I did every chore and repair an adult husband would have done for her. I can't remember a time I didn't know how to do laundry. I regularly cleaned the gutters and fixed toilets and did lawn work. Not to mention all the emotional support.

You're not alone. When a parent is broken and doesn't address it, they end up treating everyone incorrectly, especially those closest and easily utilized."

I know it's hard, and I don't envy you what you will have to work through just like I'm doing right now. You made the right decision and don't EVER let someone tell you that you should reconnect or forgive her. They always come from a good place, but lucky for them, they will never understand. I do. Lots of us do. You're not alone. üíú"

TwoXChromosomes,fcv2soy,t3_eirnp9,1577993466.0,"At the very least, this shows a super fucked up relationship between father and son. If they treat you that way now, how would married life have been? How does his father treat his mother? Has your ex shared stuff about previous girlfriends with his dad? There's way too many really awful scenarios here. 

You dodged a huge bullet. I know it sucks right now and it will take a while to heal, but YOU DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG. Please stay strong and don't return to him ever. 3 years will be a small blip on your timeline and you do not want to sign up for any more time being treated like that or worse. You walked away! You already did the hard part! Keep to it! üíú"
