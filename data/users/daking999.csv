Did you watch Beasty's new TvP guide? It's one of the best SC2 MU guides I've ever seen. WM drop -> 3rax stim +1 (with follow up) -> libs seems like by a very solid way to play. I'll find the link if you can't. 

I used to main toss. Drop play is really fucking hard to deal with at our level IF you have the multitasking. 

Also: my toss APM was <100 but my APM with T and Z is more like 150 so I don't think that means much. 

One final thing: being better at TvZ and TvT will mean you play stronger tosses. Maybe trying sucking those MUs a bit."
