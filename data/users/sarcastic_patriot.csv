9:59 and we walk in. The server said, ""Honestly, I was hoping you guys wouldn't show up.""

AskReddit,ff8p6pt,t1_ff8ncyo,1579689976.0,"I think that's where our country failed. People became so mistrusting of politicians that they wanted some change. 

Then Trump showed up and said, ""Fuck politics, fuck politicians, fuck corruption,"" and it resonated with a lot of people. They were so behind his message they ignored the giant red flags of his personality. 

As a collection, we need to vote on who's best for the country, not who's most appealing to our personal values. It's tough sometimes, but that's what's gotta be done to save this place."

facepalm,fextqd7,t1_few70ab,1579435973.0,"My school required you to live in campus freshman year if your permanent residence was over 50 miles away. I lived on campus for one semester and then figured out my sister lived *just* inside that 50, so for second semester I ""moved in"" with her and just got a cheap apartment near campus with a couple roommates - two bedroom for $625/month split four ways. Summers I moved out and lived with my parents so I didn't have to pay rent for a few months, while still taking one to two classes online. It sucked and I also think I kind of missed out on the fun part of college.

If his parents divorced and he was legitimately *not* cheating on her, does OP still have to consider them strangers and not family?

And for all you know, his dad needed the girlfriend and kids along to help reconnect with his son - he may have needed a support system as much as OP did.
