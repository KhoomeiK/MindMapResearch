SkyrimTogether,fd9islz,t1_fd8rsfm,1578233998.0,Yup. Main difference is Special edition is way more stable with way less effort. You *can* get a smoothly running Oldrim but I find that if I mod it as carelessly as I do special edition I get way more crashes and issues.

DeepIntoYouTube,fcyc5ie,t3_ejh8ai,1578077857.0,I dunno I kinda wish the punchline was stronger. Like all that happens his Bob fades in then WWII changes to painting with Hitler. I was hoping to at least see a little Bob and Hitler team up action.

I know that's probably wildy ignorant, I vaguely remember something about russian interests in Iran but I just don't get why everyone would want to throw down over it. War is expensive."

skyrimmods,fcxd6q9,t1_fcxcdk6,1578059748.0,Lol I went on an old spreadsheet and downloaded nearly every texture mod I could to try and nearly 100% replace all of the games textures. I didn't get all of them because some of them were trash but yeah don't judge.

AskReddit,fcx59k8,t1_fcwyhfk,1578051792.0,"Yup. It's really easy to criticise most children's books if you interpret them hyper literally. Same thing with the bible.

You have to think about the meaning behind it and the authors purpose.

For example, you could say Yertle the Turtle is an absurd tale about a tyrant Turtle with a love of heights, which is true, but that's hardly telling the full story."

Showerthoughts,fcw7jqz,t1_fcw6oth,1578018950.0,"Well the big word is ""maybe"" most of the stories are unsure if the person drowned first then the piranhas started feeding. It was also typically children. I actually accidentally lied and it's three stories, ever, at least that I could find from quick research on google and wikipedia. 

The main point is as a functioning adult, if there are piranhas in a river you happened to be in, as long as you can swim out you'll be fine, worse case scenario you'll get a few bites. If you can't swim out, you have bigger problems to worry about, like drowning."

Showerthoughts,fcw57jo,t1_fcw2c4j,1578017426.0,"Wasn't the story about Piranha, is that Teddy Roosevelt was visiting some country, and they blocked off a part of a river, let the Piranhas starve, then led a cow in there while Teddy was watching?

Teddy, fully pranked, then wrote about what wild and vicious fish Piranhas are hence their negative reputation today, despite maybe killing one person every 3 or 4 year according to news articles I could find."
gaming,fcw2plo,t1_fcvpxdm,1578015768.0,"Yup. I like how both facts aren't just kinda wrong but exact opposites of the truth. The more you see someone on a daily basis, the more you'll start to like each other if your compatible. It's recommended to actively make time for your partner twice a week, even during marriage or you'll grow apart.

Studies have flat out shown couples with similar interest last longer. I think the whole opposites attract thing was made by horny young people who didn't actually have a reason why they liked the other person on account of being completely different."

gaming,fcmjxxz,t1_fcld128,1577778333.0,"I can't play vanilla ark, it is so much better to set up a custom server with a couple of close friends and boost exp and shorten dino tame times as a time saving measure. 420 hours and we still haven't gotten to TEK, beaten a single boss, or explored underwater. Hell we haven't even gotten to riot gear. All because we keep deciding to start new servers because of new maps. 

In PVP it's worse because instead of incompetence resetting your progress it's random bullshit you can barely control, cheating, exploitation, or a genuine to god loss because someone attacked you. You also *need* a large tribe to do anything substantial. Good luck trying to live alone when people are running around with Tek gear and a murderous attitude."
AskReddit,fcmjgdw,t1_fcmiunv,1577777758.0,"The fact that lesbians are a minority of the population, combined with the fact that women consume less porn overall probably made it so their opinion doesn't matter to the market, since the main consumer of Yuri is guys, rather than a decent split between straight women and gay/bi men."
