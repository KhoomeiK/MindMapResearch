askwomenadvice,fekundt,t3_epc8a1,1579207950.0,"You should look into “fight the new drug”. It’s a nonprofit organization fighting against porn for more reasons then just the fact that it’s not good for couples. Example would be human trafficking is heavily correlated. I know you said he left, and my PMs are open if you need to talk. But personally, I have never been okay with someone who is okay with watching porn. 

While I’m aware it is an addiction, it is considered cheating to me. And there’s so many reasons behind why I don’t believe it is okay. My boyfriend now used to struggle with it, but after honest raw conversation we had while friends before dating, he worked on cutting it completely out of his life. He replaced it with meditation and I’m so happy to be with somebody who doesn’t rely on strangers on the internet for pleasure."

Nanny,fefh4v1,t1_fefgg2t,1579056213.0,"That’s a good idea! They are very comfortable with me and they do consider me as apart of their family, so although their was some anxiety about going to sleep with parents not home at first, that I don’t feel like it is a problem anymore. Sometimes 6F will wake up when parents come home just to say hi, but that’s just because it’s routine for mom to lay in bed with her for a couple minutes. 

Their family does a similar thing with screens, however they can use their time while eating dinner and breakfast. They get 30 minutes in the morning/during breakfast and 30 in the evening before/during dinner. 

I might start with the book thing. This evening I set a 125 minute timer for her during dinner, and that did work. But I also don’t want her to feel like she has to eat super fast/ like she’s being punished. So I’m not sure I’ll do that again. 

Thanks so much for the advice!"

relationship_advice,fdu6v72,t1_fdsg2n1,1578728617.0,"That’s manipulation. I won’t act like I didn’t do that to my boyfriend when I was younger, but I did. When he broke up with me I told him I wanted to die. It wasn’t a lie, but I wasn’t actually going to kill myself and I knew that. I just didn’t want him to leave me. He did, I lived. If she says that, tell her you’re going to tell her parents. If she freaks out and tells you not to, Id say she’s just trying to guilt trip you. I know you love her, I know this will be really hard for you. But you both need to grow and learn to live without each other. If you’re worried for her mental health, it’s okay to tell someone in her life that she’s close with that you’re planning on leaving and think that she’ll need someone to talk to/ that you’re worried about her mental health."
relationship_advice,fdu69ei,t3_emzipy,1578728311.0,"I watched a friend go through a relationship like this. Honestly, it all comes down to trust. I hope you know that. If she can’t trust you, then you have no reason to trust her. Trust and boundaries are different, but these rules (if they’re not exaggerated) seen like her own deep trust issues. It just will explode into bigger things if you don’t leave. A relationship without trust is nothing, and I’m sure you’ve heard that before. My friends situation was a little different, because they both set these crazy rules for each other. But I would say, get out of it now. While you’re still young, and let yourselves grow and heal. Tell her why you’re breaking up with her, if you want. That way she can learn from her mistake. But let yourself experience college and meet people and discover who you are."
askwomenadvice,fdu3mkz,t1_fdu3a0j,1578726942.0,"I guess I’m confused by your reply. If you’re saying that he’s a liar and “the bad guy” then why would I just tell him to go have fun? I get that we’re young, but I still feel like it’s not right."
TrueOffMyChest,fds8pq5,t3_emw5c2,1578696902.0,"First of all, I am so sorry for your guys loss. I can’t imagine that will be an easy conversation, I did just pray for you guys and will continue to do so (if that is okay by you). When you tell him, I would let him know that you talked to the school social worker and that they are there for him if he needs anything. He’s probably going to feel a lot of emotions, but him knowing that he has someone else to talk to would be good."
offmychest,fds71qh,t1_fds5kq3,1578695805.0,Sorry for all the typos in that haha.
offmychest,fds6u3v,t1_fds5kq3,1578695669.0,"I guess the thing is, his friend really doesn’t like me because he had cheated on my of my friends and she found out. But he thought I told her. He’s a good friend to him but just not a good person. So I don’t know that there’s a lot I can do. Or that my boyfriend can do. I’ve tried talking to his friend though, I wrote him a pretty long text and he didn’t respond. And when my boyfriend tried talking to him a day later, he through the word out that I’m manipulative again."
offmychest,fds4pv8,t1_fds43rn,1578694304.0,I guess I’ve always heard that people manipulate on purpose. But I did talk to him about it he he’s telling me that he doesn’t agree that I am. At least that’s what he’s telling me.
askwomenadvice,fds2myc,t3_emqf5b,1578693406.0,"Hmm, I see that you’ve already posted an update but I will share what I’m thinking. To start, I don’t like that he lied and told you he’d FaceTime you and didn’t. Then lied about calling you in a few because he was leaving. I think, overall, you handled this pretty maturely and a lot better then I probably would have. It took a lot for you to snap. But for him to post something like that is downright respectful and degrading. Whether he was drunk or not, that is not okay. I can sense that he will eventually feel bad about it and beg you to forgive him. And I’m not saying that this one incident should lead to a breakup, but if things don’t change or if you’re not happy - then maybe it should. 

Maybe suggesting to him couples therapy wouldn’t be the worst idea. That way, you’d have an unbiased opinion on his actions, but an unbiased opinion on yours as well. 

I hope all goes well!"
