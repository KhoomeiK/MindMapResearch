For Wolnir though, I can maybe share some advice. You want to run at his left bracer immediately. The fog won't get you, but be wary of him charging forward, as the most common way to die is getting trapped in his fog while he charges up the incline. Left bracer should go down relatively fast. Then, go to the right bracers and attack until victory. If you do this correctly, he won't even summon skeletons. He won't summon his sword. He'll just do sweeping attacks you have to watch out for, and his 1-2 uphill charges of course. It's usually just 1 charge uphill, though."

Mainly use it just for areas I can get it to bounce back and forth multiple times. Made a couple bosses early on total cheese. But I'm seeing that it's not really holding up that well anymore mid-game. It's not maxed out yet, but I'm looking into stronger conjuration shards. Any recommendations? I'm def going to check out hell hound.

Thinking about Teps Salrenda but it's a lot of mana."
DotA2,fcw44xg,t1_fcw1xr7,1578016717.0,"Definitely. The Holiday Season is not inclusive for people who are lonely & depressed, because obviously it places an emphasis on family and togetherness, which lonely and depressed people are less likely to have.

The holiday season also serves a constant reminder of their loneliness, since the music, lights, social media posts, fashion, etc are ubiquitous, and everyone seems to be together without you. It kind of causes you to either reject the holiday altogether and accept it as ""just another day,"" or get upset and lash out."
Bloodstained,fcw2jai,t1_fcw1pez,1578015652.0,"I took it as a one-up comment. Like, ""let's not talk about void ray, let's talk about everyone's favorite spell, hell hound, which is the best in the game fyi, and my personal favorite."" 

Maybe I was wrong. The user never clarified though so we're all just interpreting it differently. I'll try and post a video or gif of the process instead next time. I think it would also be cooler to see in action than just describe."
Bloodstained,fcw1byi,t1_fcw0f98,1578014863.0,"The spells have 0 similarity to each other. He can make that comment without even reading my post. His wording of ""nothing beats it"" means he's making a comparison, putting Hell Hound above Void Ray and every other ability when that's not the point of the thread. Do you not see how that could be interpreted as shutting someone down? It's an absolute statement that doesn't invite much else to talk about except Hell Hound."
Bloodstained,fcvzom6,t1_fcvyuc7,1578013774.0,"Except he said nothing relevant to what was posted. Might as well have made that comment in any thread talking about any spell.

""Flame Cannon is great for these situations. Here's why.""

""Nothing beats hell hound.""

Like it doesn't help facilitate discussion, it just shuts it down. Oh, ok. Hell hound is the best. I shouldn't have posted. My character is not far enough to get hell hound, so I thought doing it with void ray as unintended was neat.

He didn't say the 8-bit boss so you can't really say what he's talking about. He just said hell hound is the best room clearer."
Bloodstained,fcvvqd3,t1_fcvucmh,1578011182.0,"First off, no where in my entire post did I say that Void Ray beats every spell. I am saying it's efficient. Sounds like you didn't read my post. :(

Also bud, hell hound is not a directional, it's a conjure. It's not like you'd even choose between them. Void Ray lets you sit as far away as possible and use it like a rapid fire crossbow. It's also amazing for farming because you don't have to even go near the mob to kill them, allowing you to see if they dropped an item from the beginning of the screen. I just watched a video and hell hound is virtually melee range.

It's worth pointing out my Void Ray was rank 1 grade 1 when I killed the 8-bit nightmare boss on normal mode at level 40. I wasn't even at the inferno caves yet to loot hell hound, so you can get this a lot earlier, too.

Not disagreeing that hell hound looks insanely powerful from the videos I just watched, but I think you glossed over my points."
