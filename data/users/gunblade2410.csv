When you finish this and are looking for more work any sensible person will ask what that large amount of time developing an app resulted in. Saying it was a released but completely failed application will not help you.

I have to hope you are being paid as you go and this isn't 15k on completion. If so I suggest you sit down with them and work through the USP, who the target audience is and how this application will enhance a person's life. Do a little bit of research to see if anything similar has been attempted.

As the sole developer, from what you've said, you should be working through a development process including requirements capture, usability and feedback sessions with the target demographic (users).

Give them this opportunity, you will sleep better and it's a much better conversation in an interview."
