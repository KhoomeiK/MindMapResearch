There is one guy with whom I wrote from time to time, yet we keep it in the comments after all those months. So, maybe we'll see each other in anither post about another topic again.."
depression,fekmoj7,t1_fekm8gr,1579203237.0,"Hah. Well i'd call it a chat as we're interacting online and writing smth.

Bit I guess what you mean with chatting. If you mean with chatting, writing with a person to know each other, than no. We're not chatting. Then we're just writing at the same time about some topics"

depression,fe5kpx3,t3_enfyh1,1578870677.0,"I really feel you. Met recently a friend. Based on the things we trust each other, she likes me. Tho as she became less active online and responds shortly and after hours it sometimes seems line she doesn't want me in her life. On the other side again. She's high most of the times. And as I know too well. I have the same behaviour when I'm high. But then remembering her behaviour when I met her last time. She didn't care much about me, as I was only for a few days there in her town and not many hours to spend together, she talked more with her other buddies. And it goes on and on. Same goes with other friends sonetimes. The doubt that they actually like me. Also I'm getting skeptic when someone tells me s/he likes me or tries to spend time with me."

depression,fdev3xn,t1_fddlsqt,1578347230.0,"I have a synic(?) Mother. So she easily gets angry and yells around. She also is doing herself in, she shouted once at me for hours and when I tried to have my space she followed me and didn't let me. She thought I would hit her and threatened her. As she told my brother (and me closely in the end of the one sided quarrel). The only way to deal with those kind of people is to play with their emotions. I realized it too late to really train it. I noticed it last year and I'm 17 ish now so I'll use my last years to train manipulating people. Do the same before it's too late."
