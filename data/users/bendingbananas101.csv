Congrats on showing how misinformed you are. 

A) Seems that the most powerful military in the world and the “most effective military force at combating asymmetric adversaries in modern history.” Can’t even beat one small group that we don’t like. You think they’ll become experts when it comes to killing their friends, family, and countrymen? 

B) Last time I checked, they can still communicate in Afghanistan. Even the mighty NSA can’t monitor everyone’s communications, especially if encrypted. Once you come up with a way to completely implement martial law for hundreds of millions of people over millions and millions of square miles of land indefinitely get back to me. Do you think people would say “well they gave us a curfew last week so we better pack everything in”? Martial law and cutting communications are stopgap measures, not solutions. 

C) Overwhelming firepower hasn’t worked in asymmetric warfare yet but this time it would for sure, right? I take it you’ve never heard of an IED. Hit and run is a very effective strategy. Will they fire their mortars and machine guns into crowds? That won’t work well into their favor. Under equipped and under trained? Still seems to be effective in Afghanistan. 

D) See the above oath to the constitution. These men (and a few women) won’t be able to be paid if the government can’t make money due to eternal civil war and martial law. You think they would betray all their principles at the flip of a dime just because they’re paid to?

Most military age people I know would fight to defend their freedoms if they’re under attack. What military people do you know that would just start blowing up American homes because they were told to? I don’t know any. 

In this hypothetical scenario, we’ve already thrown away the comforts of being an American. There has to be some reason people are fighting. If everything was hunky-dory, people wouldn’t be fighting. The only credulity being strained is yours. Americans fighting for freedom is pretty much America 101. 

Look at the Taliban. We don’t like them and we can’t get rid of them. The military likes Americans and you think it would be easy? Our technology doesn’t seem to be doing very much good. You can’t police much with a fifteen million dollar smart bomb.

>I also believe people tend to overestimate how many military units would defect... One should remember who pays these soldiers, puts food on their families plates, and that they have all sworn an oath to the US constitution

The citizens pay the military. So if it the issue was taking citizen’s guns, that violates the constitution and you would expect large defections. The only likely scenario that would muster enough support for an insurrection is egregious violations of the constitution. That isn’t treason and it’s all the more reason for military defectors.

Mobilized against what? All of her citizens? The military members are also citizens. A significant chunk of them would side with the insurrection. 

Let’s assume there was zero defection. The military wouldn’t be able to ‘win’ any more than they’ve won against Al Qaeda or the Taliban. We’ve been trying to beat them for years. 

The military is only 100% composed of soldiers in theory. All the logistics, supply, or maintenance personnel won’t be super helpful for military policing. It probably takes dozens of people to equip, run, and maintain an F-16. It wins in terms of raw power but in terms of practicality, a guy with a concealed handgun wins. There are millions more of the latter. 

These hypotheticals don’t plan out well on paper because the reason for insurrection is never clear. Tyrannical despot? Trampling of basic human rights? Taking guns? Those would all have significant military defections and martial law can’t be held forever. The longer they draw out the more people would favor the rebels. 

If a significant and well armed portion of the population decides to revolt, the military can’t win short of totalitarianism which might just bring more people against them."
