Polar bears are one of the most dangerous animals not just in Canada but on Earth, fortunately (and sadly even more so due to climate change) they are extremely rare."
AskReddit,feeedex,t1_fee26jk,1579032024.0,"1.  Depends on your income, but on average about 5-10% more than Americans.  If you Google this you'll find some decent articles in the top hits.  
2. $0.  Though you still might have to pay for certain medicines or dentistry.
3. If it's not life threatening (i.e. you need knee surgery after you tore your MCL snowboarding), you might be waiting up to a year
4. If it's life threatening (i.e. you've just been shot) you won't wait at all.  If it's potentially life threatening (you need heart surgery or a tumour removed), maybe a few hours to a week depending on the nature and severity
5. This will vary depending on where you live and how busy your GP is.  Rescheduling physicals is usually a couple weeks to a month.  If you had to see a doctor about a flu or sinus infection, you'd be better off going to an urgent care clinic where you'd be seen in 1-3 hours.
6. Most Canadians register with a family doctor so it's definitely possible to develop a relationship with them.
7. In some (not all) provinces there is opportunity to pay for faster or preferential treatment.
8. As mentioned above, our taxes are slightly higher, but with a disproportionately positive return (IMO).  I have not encountered many professionals who have found it difficult to maintain savings/RRSPs due to taxation
9. There is no indication our health care system is going to crumble anytime soon.  It's part of our national identity, and any politician looking to scrap our health care would meet severe opposition."

AskReddit,feeb95a,t1_fee5cm3,1579030198.0,"I've done quite a bit of travelling, and to be honest a lot of Americans are condescending pricks when they travel.  Is it possible your classmate was constantly telling people that Canada is America's hat, or the U.S. could destroy Canada whenever they wanted?  Because that happens a lot.

That doesn't justify keying their car btw, but there's a reason why many Americans pose as Canadians when they travel abroad.  I've never heard of someone keying a foreigners car here, so it's likely not a common occurrence."
AskReddit,feeav59,t1_fee5wxz,1579029970.0,"I'd say the country is roughly 50:50 split on Trudeau.  People that like him applaud his progressive ideology, his charisma, and his legalization of marijuana.  People that don't like him dislike him because he has reneged on many of his original platforms (electoral reform, anti oil pipeline, fulfillment of promises to indigenous communities, etc..), has displayed unethical/hypocritical behaviour (blackface, treatment of female AG in SNC Lavalin affair, unfair prosecution of RAdm Normal, etc...).  He's also very unpopular in Western Canada because it tends to be much more conservative.

Even among his detractors, almost everyone feels he's a better leader than Trump, and that gives him a lot of leeway by comparison"

AskReddit,fee9cs9,t1_fee743u,1579029087.0,"The short answer is yes.

Health care here is triaged, so if you're in the emergency room with a throat infection, you're going to be waiting a while.  If you're suffering a life threatening injury or illness, you will not have to wait nor will you have to mortgage your house to pay for it.

Most of the horror stories have to do with non life threatening injuries/illnesses and waiting for specialists (i.e. if I need an MRI for my knee I might have to wait 6 months).  Canada experiences a pretty severe brain drain too, with a lot of our specialist medical staff going down to the States where they can make more money"

The TLDR is that Canadians pay a little bit more in taxes (both sales and income), but get disproportionately more in return ( free health care, better unemployment insurance, and most jobs have more generous leave structures and maternity benefits)"

If you mean animals, the polar bear is the most dangerous.  They're one of the only creatures in the animal kingdom that will stalk a human for kilometres in order to kill and eat them.  Bull moose can be very aggressive, especially during mating season, but do not hold a candle to polar bears."
PokemonROMhacks,fee5tel,t1_fee4uz1,1579027000.0,"One thing to note about that particular hack for your next playthrough is that throughout the game you'll find a ""trade chain"" starting with your unevolved starter and ending with a fully evolved version of your starter with it's hidden ability.

For example in town X you'll have someone trade you a fennekin for your froaky, in town Y they'll give you a quilladin for your braixen and then in town Z you'll get a greninja for your chesnaught.

I think it's the only way to get a protean greninja in the game if that's your thing :)"
