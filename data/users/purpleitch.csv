I will say, I don’t hear/know of a lot of people looking to enter this field in particular; it could just be my school. 

I’m primarily interested in things like writing pedagogy, literacy rates and how they’re affected by technology, the effect of emerging technologies and medias (streaming services, digital assistants, smart watches) on those things. Not that I couldn’t do that as a senior thesis, but they don’t really let you research pedagogy until graduate level, sadly. 

I know that it’s hard out there, I’ve been following the grad subs for a while o-o 

I just can’t see myself going anywhere other than grad school right now. I am going to talk to my advisor this week to see if she has any ideas for me, since they usually have more ideas than ‘idk, more school?’

Thanks for your input, I appreciate any opinion on this stuff!"

I’d recommend a rhetorical thinking class (similar to philosophy), which is usually listed as an English course, and it’s very critical thinking heavy. I love rhetoric courses because you end up talking about a variety of topics, not just literature (handy for non-English majors!). 

Another class I would recommend is technical writing. Sounds boring, and it kind of is. However, pretty much everyone will be writing some kind of communications in their professional life, so this class has been highly useful to me, and I’m still in school. This class basically just teaches you how to research, and how to write resumes. And it counted for my sophomore level writing class!"

Potatoes (cheap, easy)
Onions (flavah)
Garlic (because it’s garlic)
Eggs (good source of protein)
Some whole grain bread for your sammiches or w/e

Meats:
Ground beef (foolproof)
Chicken breasts (can be made into anything)

Conversely if you’re vegan or something:
Chickpeas are a cheaper alternative to tofu,
Black beans,
Mushrooms,
Shredded carrots,
Dat almond butter life (but it’s pricey so you may wanna avoid it)

Pasta/grains:
getchu like 3lbs of elbow noodles, Walmart sells em;
5 lb bag of rice, 
some red beans (try to change your bean game up so it’s not the same type of protein every time, you’ll fuck up your stomach that way)


Dairy(if you’re not vegan):
cheese(can really up the tasty factors, and gives you vitamin d too),
yogurt, but individual packs so they stay longer,
I NEVER BUY MILK IN BULK (I’m lactose intolerant, but I hated only drinking like 2 cups out of a gallon, it’s a huge waste of money)

Frozen stuffs:
any frozen vegetable,
frozen pizzas (delicious, good for a treat, cheap as hell)

Snicky snacks:
fruit snacks are good, dried fruit and the like,
almonds, trail mix, etc,
granola bars,
bananas make a great snack! Lots of energy.

If you’re a coffee drinker it’s always helpful to make that at home too. Waaaaay cheaper

college,feig3w6,t3_ep1or8,1579137723.0,"So, yeah, that freshman 15 is notorious, but it has a lot of contributing factors: 

-people drink (illegally if you’re in the states), and that is a lot of empty calories you’re chugging down, and I remember many a time when I was 19, headed to Waffle House for my hangover meal the next morning. 

-no parents to tell you to eat broccoli. 

-I mean, pizza IS better than salad. 

-people eating at weird hours of the day, so you don’t pay attention to your meal sizes. I would recommend little snicky snacks throughout the day, so you don’t gorge late at night—that’s really what’ll put on the weight.

Above all, you’ll have to go out of your way to eat healthy at a lot of universities, but there’s plenty of recreational athletic fun times to be had to burn those calories."

Try to avoid peanut based things, lots of people are sensitive to that nowadays and even residue can kill someone. I always have a water bottle on me so I’m not thirsty, and most university or college campuses have little refill stations everywhere.

I went to App years ago, ended up at a community college, and now I’m here, and I’m much happier! More programs, better programs, etc, etc. Not saying App is a bad school, it’s just so small that there’s not a ton you can do up there.
