Grumpy substitute put my name *and* the kid's name on a list along with like 15 other kids in class who did any minor offense. I was like, A+ goody two-shoes kid so when homeroom teacher came to lead us back to class he made all the kids whose names the sub had written come up to the front of the line as a little public humiliation. He was actually taken aback when he called my name and little 5th grade me was sniveling like a baby.

When we got back to class the teacher started asking everyone what they got in trouble for and he seemed like genuinely confused when he got to me. I was ready to cry explaining that I didn't do anything wrong. The kid who'd been elbowing me In the first place actually backed me up, bless his heart. Technically the teacher didn't wind up getting me in any trouble but for the teacher's pet child I was that event was devastating."

AskReddit,ff558nw,t3_erpbkn,1579580592.0,My dad went viral for a crazy video of him burning a MAGA hat with what the internet interpreted as a flamethrower.

The guy didn't even link the video he just downloaded it and uploaded it onto his Twitter with no credit which I didn't have the heart to explain to my dad because he was too busy laughing his ass off at all the comments people made on the post.
