On the other hand, a player who did mod the game can do a glitch with you known as a ‚Äúgive cars to friends glitch‚Äù. This is how you get Yankton plates. Once you have a vehicle with said plates, there are other glitches circulating out there that allow you to put upgrades, including license plates, on other cars. This is called a ‚Äúmerge‚Äù glitch, since you ‚Äòmerge‚Äô the cars."
