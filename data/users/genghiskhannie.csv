I’m so grateful for the clients that just want to read magazines or fuck around on their phone so I can just work instead of entertaining them. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoy talking to a lot of my clients. But when it’s one chatty person after another after another, I just want to jump out a window."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffd0f8f,t1_ffcydnw,1579810968.0,"Oh! Yes. But some women, like the one in this tweet, are stuck in the past. She’s complaining about not being chased."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffcx1ky,t1_ffculmx,1579809049.0,I wish I could read tone through text. I have no idea if you’re being sarcastic or serious or what.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffci99p,t3_esuq2s,1579800035.0,"I’ve never understood wanting to be chased. If I’m being chased that means I’m running. I’m not going to run from something (or in this case, someone) I want. So this whole men taking no for an answer/refusing to play games thing really works for me."

Omg that’s so cute"
MomForAMinute,fegvk5h,t1_feetcsk,1579103498.0,"Yay! Thanks!

What’s pyramiding about? Does tortellini have a distinct personality? What’s he like? I’m just sort of assuming it’s a boy because he looks exactly like my grandpa, but a little greener. How do you determine the sex of a tortoise?"
facepalm,fedpqhr,t3_eon0hp,1579017221.0,Why is this a facepalm? Skin so soft repels bugs. Isn’t that what they’re asking for?
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe2xhor,t1_fe2al2s,1578843983.0,I think you have to enjoy doing/wearing makeup to enjoy watching an application. I don’t watch this guy but there are a couple MUAs that I really enjoy because sometimes I learn stuff.
PoliticalHumor,fdoycq4,t1_fdnp3og,1578615685.0,That’s a common misconception. It’s not implying that they’re equivalent. The pot is calling the shiny kettle black because it sees its own reflection.

Unexpected,fdl7nmo,t1_fdl0w1p,1578518438.0,"Trial and Error was such an underrated show. He was on Heroes, Masters of Sex. Can’t remember what else he’s done (or his name) but I feel like we works a lot. The girl looks familiar but I can’t place her. Maybe she just has one of those faces."
BeAmazed,fdk9v30,t1_fdjqaeq,1578499342.0,Dogs are really good at teaching other dogs. I tried to teach my little basset mix how to spin. I mean we spent an ungodly amount of time working on this trick. I had my golden retriever demonstrate how to do it once. You could almost see the lightbulb go on above my other dog’s head. Like “oh is that what this dumbass human wants? I can do that.”
facepalm,fdk7j3c,t3_elu23c,1578497861.0,Ok this guy has got to be a troll. He keeps retweeting people proving him wrong and says things like “it just occurred to me that Vladimir Putin never lettered in shit”.
