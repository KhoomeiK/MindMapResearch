Sure, 80% won’t stay friends w/ me but even though I’m an introvert, I’ve really been putting myself out there and meeting a lot of people and everyone is really friendly. 

The people who kinda talk to me but also give me the cold shoulder, it’s fine but I distance myself immediately. Same with people who ignore in a group. Has happened only a couple of times but I won’t deal with that high school bullshit anymore. 

Anyway, I’m new here and would love to meet someone who’s more experienced in campus. I would love a gym or study or hockey buddy. I’m in CGS but I am looking to either dual major or double major in CS+Math/Stats and then get an MBA afterwards. Let me know if you would like someone who isn’t really into superficial friendships or is the ghosting type of person."

I can’t give you ratios but you need good ripe avocados, lime juice (more than what most people say), salt to taste (it will not taste good if you put too little, will taste awful if you put too much), diced onions, a lot of cilantro, chili’s/jalapeños to taste, diced tomatoes (optional).

IWantToLearn,fez1fyn,t3_eqxai9,1579453038.0,"I used to work at a restaurant that made really good tortilla chips but I never made them myself.

We fried the pre-cut chips (do not re-use oil more than once), squeeze a bunch of lime juice and put salt. Toss the chips.

You can probably make the chips themselves by getting corn tortillas, drying them in the oven, and then cutting them.

Super simple, and I wish I had specifics to give you but I don’t except eat them warm, fresh, and put a good amount of lime and salt"

YouShouldKnow,fdxznsm,t1_fdxoz3p,1578774559.0,"We need much harder Drivers Tests. What I needed to do in order to pass my drivers test is basically what I learnt in my first week of driving. The only semi-difficult part for me was driving a car I was unfamiliar with. My brother ended up with 1 mistake on his test (max 15), and I ended up with 3 (but I got 2 for driving past a stop sign with the pedestrian still having one foot on the road). 

My point is, driving tests should be far more extensive, and comprehensive. Everyone should know how to deal with scenarios where other people are idiots instead of perfect scenarios where everyone follows the law completely."

stocks,fcwcuyk,t1_fcvu8gh,1578022463.0,"Not op but I have a few questions.

Just to clarify: rallying is when a stock has a period of sustained growth without a big fall

Momentum is kind of the derivative of price changes / change in velocity vs velocity itself

RSI: how bearish/bullish a stock is? I was confused when I saw this one online.

Is there a place where this info is readily available? I’ve only been messing around with RH.

What do you mean by support holding?

What is hedging a stock?

I’ve heard that it is very difficult / impossible to time the market but you are saying that timing is key. Are the two mutually exclusive or are you referring to something different?

Ik it’s a lot of questions so answer as many/few as you like or have time for. Thanks!"
