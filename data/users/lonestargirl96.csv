texas,ff6is29,t1_ff6h3vs,1579628091.0,"This is a cynical manoeuvre to sink Texas as a conservative bastion. More illegal immigrants means the living wage can be lowered which makes the capitalist incentive, Latinos overwhelmingly vote democrat so that makes the social-left incentive. 

But it doesn't matter does it? Me writing this? You don't see me as a human being with hopes and dreams. You have been so brain damaged by decades of media consumption that someone wanting the rules on the books to be enforced is the devil incarnate or some racist stereotype.
At the very best, you are being manipulated into the slaughter of your society, at the very worst: you are an enthusiastic participant.

Adios Texas. Hola California."
