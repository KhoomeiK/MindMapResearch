depressed,ffz67rx,t3_evukfa,1580365272.0,"Have you talked to a therapist about how you feel? Have you actually been diagnosed with depression? If not, start there. If you get the diagnosis, then start thinking about adding medication and speaking to a psychiatrist. 

Therapy will help. I can't say much about your herpes diagnosis but I've seen plenty of posts by people with the same diagnosis explaining how it isn't the end of the world. It does suck, though, I'm not downplaying the crappiness of the diagnosis. Just that you can find some posts that can offer support and hope. 

Therapy would be where you also might want to discuss whether continuing down this education path is really a good decision for you. Is it something you really want and the depression is just crushing any of your old desires, or is it really just not what you want for your life anymore?"
depressed,ffyzggg,t3_evwhvv,1580359211.0,"You sound absolutely wonderful. But I think you may want to start treating this like he was purposely pushing you away to get out of the relationship without having the decency to talk to you about it. Even if he does still wants to be with you, he is not giving you the respect you deserve. It does sound like you are doing everything right. But a relationship is about two people bringing joy and respect to each other. He doesn't seem interested in reciprocating that to you. Depression is not an excuse to treat others poorly. 

I've been in your place before and I know exactly how you feel, and I hurt for you because I can see myself in your exact position. But I ended up making things worse for myself trying to hold onto something that the other person had already decided in their head was over."

It's people deciding to get in a car together and go out in neighborhoods searching for vehicles left running. Which is being organized. Those are three separate things- organized crime ring, thieves with a plan, a doped up neighbor kid steal crap from your garage on a whim.

It's too deep, walls have nothing to grab on. This is when you are in your worst depression. Therapy is the rescuers lowering down food and water to keep you alive and going another day. But you are still stuck. Antidepressants are the ladder that get you within a few feet from the top, but not actually to the top. But you're almost there. Now with therapy throwing you food and water, it gives you the strength you need to pull yourself that rest of the way out."

And these are all side streets, not main streets. So there must be quite a lot of people out trolling the neighborhoods because this always happens in a 5-10 time span and there's no reason to be on these streets unless you live there. So this isn't a crime of opportunity. People are out purposely looking for cars be left on to warm up. Based on one that happened in Fox Point where they chased them, one double theft within minutes of each other in WFB, and one that happened in a matter of 22 sec in Shorewood, it sounds like car loads of people drive around, see a car running and drop one off to steal it.

Ideally you want to be in therapy simultaneously. It's how to most effectively help yourself.

Just remember, antidepressants are started at a low dose and increased gradually. You won't feel the effects for about 6 weeks. If you don't feel any different by then, or you feel side effects, talk to your doctor about changing meds. Keep a journal of how you feel each day.

If the recipient from one pair is compatible with the donor from the other pair, and vice versa– the transplant center may arrange for a ""swap""–for two simultaneous transplants to take place.

badwomensanatomy,ffgd44o,t1_fffil9q,1579903575.0,"Yes. He was explaining that when the pill was invented, to please the Catholic Church (inventor was also devout Catholic), it allowed for a placebo week for women to still get their periods to mimic the ""rhythm method.""  But Gladwell shows it is completely unnecessary to actually stop birth control for a placebo week. 

The study with the Mali did show significantly decreased periods due to many pregnancies and ""long menstrual-free stretches caused by intensive breast feeding,"" but the conclusion was not to show women need to be pregnant. The quote by the author of the study is, ""it's a pity that gynecologists think that women have to menstruate every month. They just don't understand the real biology of menstruation.""

What this means is that ""incessant ovulation"" has taken a toll on our bodies and subjecting ""women's bodies to changes and stresses that they were not necessarily designed by evolution to handle."" This does lead to increased risks of some cancers. Because ""any change promoting cell division has the potential to increase cancer risk, and ovulation appears to be one of those changes.""

The entire point of Gladwell and the study is that the pill should never have allowed for the placebo week, and that contraception is imperative for women to suppress their periods. ""... had talked about the pill not as a contraceptive but as a cancer drug- not as a drug to prevent life but as one that would save life..."" which is pretty much the exact opposite of women should constantly be pregnant.

suicidology,ff0q9x9,t3_er2n07,1579471309.0,"It depends. In my family, there certainly is a ""notion of prolonged daily struggle against death."" Because they've watched me do it. They've taken me to all forms of treatment. And they continually tell me how strong I am. And if I do die one day, though they will be avsolutely devastated, they certainly won't be shocked. But that devastation will last their lifetime. The exact same scenario played out with a distant cousin of mine maybe 15-20 years ago. They all watched him struggle, they all did everything to help, and when they did find him dead, there was little shock. But the devastation, even to this day, is tangible. It is certainly not ""a moment"" for the ones left behind. You just created an ongoing struggle for someone else with your death. You should head over to r/suicidebereavement if you honestly think it's just ""a moment"" of pain. 

I do see what you are saying. Most people do not take the severity of the struggle seriously when they cannot see it. But at the same time, successfully fighting suicide is for you to live. Not to prove anything to anyone. I'm not going to attempt suicide so people take me more seriously. That just sounds like a pathetic attempt at a pity party. I'm not worried about ""the audience."" That makes me sound like an angsty teen. 

And yes. Suicide is rarely one tiny thing. But there are often a lot of missed opportunities to seek help and instead chose to prolong and increase your own suffering.

If taking care of kids makes you happy, there are plenty of actual volunteer organizations that need help with children. Most parents struggle financially. But childcare is part of being a parent and budgeting. And to pay you such a ridiculous amount is incredibly disrespectful of that mother. It's simply not ok. It's your choice to keep doing it but you need to understand that you are being taken advantage of. Period. 

And a side note, you are not a manny. You are babysitting."

Nanny,fepi42s,t1_feoh9qs,1579321081.0,"You will take any job? You are getting 50 cents an hour. If you worked an 8 hour day, you will have made $4.00. So what money is it that you like? You could find more money walking around on the street. Or get a paper route for more thsn that. You are just being taken advantage of and you are making excuses for it. I was babysitting when I was 12 and back then I was making $5 an hour. And this was quite a while ago. 

Tell your families if they want to hire you, you will take $5 min. By the time you are of legal working age, you should be making more than minimum wage. Doesn't matter that you are a boy. Don't accept pocket change and make excuses for it. You are literally just wasting your time then working for 50 cents an hour."
Nanny,fephjf1,t3_eq1lmk,1579320653.0,"I've been a nanny for several families with newborn twins so word gets around. Last week I was asked if I could help take care of 6 wk old twins when I had free time so the mom could get some sleep. My first question- they understand I don't do this for free, right?   I'm told they understand they'll have to pay but don't want to pay much. I say *before* contacting me, tell them I'll drop my rate to $15 an hour for them since I'd just be doing it when I feel like. They call. Put me on speaker so husband and wife can both hear. Again, I say $15 an hour. They agree. They want me to come for 2 hours on Tuesday night. Ok. It's about a 25 min drive.

After I'm there for about an hour and a half, plus entertaining the 4 year old as well (which I was not told about), the father tells me he only budgeted $20 so how much more time will that get him. What? He says he figured it would be like the deli where you see how much you can get for a set amount. Are you kidding me? It was so damn disrespectful. He easily could have asked me this prior to me coming. I stayed the full two hours because I'm too damn nice (the mother was sleeping and the twins were on me sleeping) but I told them they should find someone in their budget for the future."

I'm in the US and even though I can follow Canadian sellers, I can't actually see your items unless I switch markets. 

I don't necessarily agree with the other person about keeping your closet fresh. That's for resellers and boutiques with return buyers looking for new stuff. If you are just selling what's in your closet, make sure you have good pictures and descriptions, share your items, share other people items in the Canadian market, and follow more people only in the Canadian market. Don't worry about US followers. The point is to get exposure among people who can actually buy from you."

Which really matters more than the msrp."
poshmark,feoamil,t1_feo9u68,1579297384.0,It honestly does not matter at all. The status means nothing. The only thing that changes is that the posh algorithm sends more followers your way.

It's hard to tell from this post whether you are seeing things that aren't there or is he really is not showing you respect by not telling you something is bothering him. Either way, right now it's all about communication. You both need to talk and set up a plan. If he's not alerting you to something wrong, you need to confront him immediately about that.
