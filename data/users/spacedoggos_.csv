AmItheAsshole,ffm4p7c,t3_eu1v2s,1580048492.0,"NTA. he’s taking up all the communal spaces for 6 hours every Saturday night, that’s really inconsiderate, social anxiety aside. He’s being polite to his friends at the expense of being rude to you. You’re within your rights to put your foot down and say he has to alternate (not that he may agree)"
Instagramreality,ffgygus,t3_etk4cs,1579918307.0,I kind of hope she can get the surgery she needs to be happy. Can’t be easy in that family.
AmItheAsshole,ff9ybtc,t3_esar53,1579724137.0,"NTA. The medicinal community is really against  coerced donations, particularly for organs but this falls under a similar ethics area. Your friend is an asshole both for pressuring and in terms of medical ethics. But you’re a good person considering facing your fear to help people"
AmItheAsshole,ff9v7da,t3_escpo7,1579722197.0,YTA. Kid will grow up hating it. It’s an important part of her identity and you want it to be a dad joke
ABoringDystopia,ff9gpsa,t3_es556u,1579712647.0,They call you Piers Morgan
AmItheAsshole,ff8tle7,t3_erz04o,1579695603.0,"YTA. Like others have said, this sub has almost no empathy and thinks it’s legal advice. You could have helped someone with almost no cost to yourself and you didn’t."
AskReddit,ff646i2,t3_ero8mj,1579618692.0,"I recently had a fight with my parents which resulted in me having to flee the country for my safety. I was really upset about it until a friend reminded me I'd just achieved my childhood dream of running away. That might be disturbing to some people but I had put up with the most toxic parents imaginable, being screamed at whenever they were in a bad mood and insulted and treated like shit. I'd had plans to run away for as long as I could remember and I'd finally stood up for myself, and I felt so free. I knew my 13 year old self, the year it got bad, would be so proud and I wanted some way to say to her""we finally did it. You were right all along. You're worth more than this""

Also, since moving out 18 months ago I was finally able to grow my hair down to my back, as it was my 13 year old self's dream to look like Aria from Pretty Little Liars, so she'd be stoked about that too"
AmItheAsshole,ff4khph,t3_erijgn,1579565806.0,"NTA. Please cancel the wedding. This won’t go well for anyone. Seriously, who thinks like that?"
fatlogic,ff46oyi,t3_er5s1i,1579556725.0,I was really surprised there’s actually only 263 calories in a cheeseburger
AmItheAsshole,feuw54n,t3_eqlbl1,1579390506.0,"No way. How horrible of your husband, not to mention his mother. Strong NTA and I wouldn’t just forget about this"
femalehairadvice,fes77x3,t3_eqax6w,1579362125.0,You look so pretty that I’m considering chopping all my hair off
AmItheAsshole,feei7k6,t3_eoley4,1579034265.0,"YTA, not even a close call. £950 is pretty reasonable for a weeding dress. Wish is a cheap crap type of place. It’s her wedding day and she’s not even asking for anything extravagant. This is not how you treat and almost-wife."
AmItheAsshole,fe2boat,t3_enkbgp,1578836613.0,The way you talk about your first kid is disturbing.
femalehairadvice,fdn2fk2,t3_em6xbv,1578575266.0,Unrelated but you look like Sarah Hyland
fatlogic,fdligdq,t1_fdlibcv,1578524727.0,"Hair can be too damaged to grow long, like breaking off because of dye or heat, or just genetically thin/brittle."
fatlogic,fdkhguh,t3_eltodu,1578503966.0,She would have made her point better if short hair= bad. In her scenario it’s really easy to just cut your hair off and harder to let it grow. And long hair is often healthier than short hair.
AskReddit,fdjp1um,t3_elju40,1578481668.0,"My parents. Grainne. In English, sounds like groin. I’ve been asked if it were a disease."
AmItheAsshole,fdh6oe9,t3_elawpx,1578416538.0,"I mean what you did was wrong...but “pride my son with the love he was entitled to” is such great parenting. So you are technically the asshole by the rules of this sub, and you probably didn’t show your kid a great example in this one situation. But it seems like in general you’re doing good."
