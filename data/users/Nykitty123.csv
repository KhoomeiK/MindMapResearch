pygame,ffdf1lw,t3_esmuwx,1579819513.0,"Do some basic tutorials just to get the feel of things (I like tech with Tim). Then let your creativity take over. Start with a small project of a classic game/ game genre and learn skills off that. 

Don't be afraid to rewrite your code even if it does take ages.

Let your creativity run free

Don't give up! You got this 

Enjoy it. If it's not work, it's for fun let it be fun if you can help it 

Make sure when you reach that level to always be object orientated. It makes things 1000x easier to read and change"

pygame,feo5cu3,t1_feo3p26,1579295385.0,"Thank you so much for the links and advice :-) I have (far too much) time on my hands and I'm pretty sick of one off coding projects. I'm starting to plan for a couple of hours long JRPG and I'll start writing, but yeah it's gonna take a while. Thanks :-) also by small I meant like a small Dev team although yeah the phrasing was ambiguous :-) cheers"

Damn the founder was a great guy, I wonder what he got up to. He originally set help a schizo up as a safe haven for the mentally ill, or anyone that wanted to join (as long as you weren't a dick) but months bled into months and..  it kinda collapsed sadly."
