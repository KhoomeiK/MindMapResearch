Until you can figure out why your relationship with alcohol is a problem, you will be most likely to earn their forgiveness by not drinking at all.

This is likely not a one time thing, and it sounds like you are going to have to decide which is more important, your relationship with alcohol or your relationship with your friends.

Odds are, you'll end up deciding that your relationship with alcohol is more important, because most people with alcohol problems do.  Head on over to /r/stopdrinking and you'll likely see a lot of people who WISH they had stopped at the point you are, and didn't.  And ended up REALLY regretting it.

So you can take this as the HUGE red flag it is, or you can make all of the (potentially valid) excuses for why your drinking isn't a problem and this is a one time thing, and keep digging yourself deeper and deeper.

It's your life, but if you want this to really not happen again, and really want to salvage your relationships, then the sure answer is to stop drinking and get to therapy right now to figure out what's going on behind the scenes in your head."

Finally, the muscle will use up more calories (not much, but some) than fat (possibly excluding brown fat, but that's a whole other thing), which will also result in a net gain from a metabolic standpoint.

But yes, having the same weight in muscle vs fat added to your body is going to look a lot different, even if the weight doesn't change.  And I've seen plenty of people who GAIN weight (through building muscle) from their starting point still look a LOT slimmer/better/healthy than their starting (lower) weight.  In other words, they lost 10 lbs of fat, but put on 11 lbs of muscle, and now look like they lost even more weight than 10 lbs, even though they technically weigh more than when they started."
povertyfinance,feaq0w2,t1_feajvbl,1578951231.0,"Yup, best simple explanation I've seen:

That's why A) trickle down economics doesn't work and B) why EVEN IF the actual costs of goods goes up (it doesn't, at least not by much), there still ends up being a net positive.  People actually being able to buy things is what drives the economy.  

If the cost of goods production goes up slightly, but people are able to buy more, then there doesn't actually need to be an increase in the base price if sales go up.  At some point it will stabilize anyway, and wherever that is is still going to be a net gain from the current non-sustainable SES gaps."

Elsewhere in the thread, I specifically talked about working with the medical team to address this, and being in compliance with what the treatment is.

What I'm trying to speak to is a bunch of the fearmongering I see in a lot of places, and then see shades of it unintentionally regurgitated in other places that basically amounts to ""If you do pot, you can go crazy.""  That is not true.  There's a bunch of reasons why using marijuana is a bad idea, and a bunch of anti-patterns around how it can seem to make things better while making them actually worse.  

But there's even more misinformation out there that is demonizing it, which I personally think causes even more problems than pot itself.

I personally rank it right up there with booze.  Not a great coping strategy, and if you're using it to avoid dealing with things, that can have downstream ramifications, but by itself it is really neither good nor bad.  I've seen people it helps, I've seen people who are not productive members of society, and I attribute that directly to the choices they make, with pot being one of those choices."

AskReddit,feaax5h,t3_eo83cx,1578946434.0,"Informed consent is key.  I believe there exists a reasonable standard for what most people believe a ""normal"" sexual encounter is.  I would suspect for a heterosexual couple, this would likely include the possibility of oral sex and piv, for example.  

I personally believe that anything outside of ""normal"" should be disclosed so it can be consented to.  This would include any STD/STI's, non standard ""parts"", non standard sexual acts (BDSM/roleplay/specific sex positions), etc.

People should consent to the sex they have, if they don't consent, it's not cool.  And if they don't know, they can't consent.

So to answer the specific question: Yes, I believe that if someone is transgendered, they should let their partner know before sex.  From a pragmatic standpoint, they should do so in a way that protects everyone's safety (so not right in the middle of the act, or as a ""throwaway"" before getting down to business)."

And frankly, if I was having psychosis, I might be more inclined to use pot to cope as well.

But that's not ""cannabis can trigger / exascerbate psychosis in people who are at a higher risk for it."" ESPECIALLY given how much misinformation is out there regarding the side effects and consequences of marijuana, and that most of that misinformation is based on bad faith efforts to keep it illegal, I will continue to express my surprise if someone says ""marijuana triggered a psychotic episode."""

The symptoms of that are likely (repeat LIKELY) manageable with medical intervention (the right pills every day, and probably some supplemental therapy).  However, getting to there may take some work, some understanding, and above all his dedication to complying with the treatment.

First step is to write down all of the symptoms, and discuss them with his medical team.  If he gets diagnosed (with anything), then they will likely have next treatment steps.  Those steps may work, they may not.  If they work, then things will likely get better as he complies with the treatment plan.   If they don't work, then the medical team will likely try some other stuff, which will work or it won't.  Until something along the line does work.

Thankfully, the total cost was within budget.  But I've had a lot of friends get into huge debt for vet care that came in a bit at a time, and each time they thought ""well, this visit isn't that much so go ahead and do x"" meanwhile the total cost was almost $5k,and the dog STILL had to be put down within six months (got hit by a car, required amputation, never fully recovered)."
