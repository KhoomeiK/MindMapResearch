That alone would have swung it.  I went out and voted specifically for this reason.  Also, what if all the bullshit double voting, messenger / mail in ballots and ballot harvesting were cut out so that the only votes cast were one per legal registered voter?"

Kids in my high school made 'zip guns' in shop class out of wood, nails and rubber bands - is the idiot AG going to make wood, nails and rubber bands illegal too?"
NewJerseyuncensored,ffcw5ef,t3_esmkut,1579808514.0,"None of that crap was Sinatra's, it's all shit from a casino hotel that had a 'Sinatra Suite'.  Decades ago I worked for a moving and storage company that had a couple truckloads of crap from the same casino, the old / former 'Golden Nugget', mostly ice machines and chandeliers.  The ice machines were trash since they stored them all upside down, and the chandeliers when you get up close are spray painted junk you could pull apart with your bare hands.  That place has been closed for forever now, so anything that was still inside the building was written off as unsaleable garbage 20 years ago."
NewJerseyuncensored,ffcvdtj,t1_ffc9l74,1579808049.0,"Again, your last bit, 'Each state shall appoint' makes it clear that each individual state is to appoint electors, not neighboring states or some amalgamation of states.  As far as figuring out how much it costs to go after each vote, how do you see that working out?  Here's a hint - going to the big states is the most cost effective way to go after votes, so again, no one will bother with the interior of the country, because there's less population density and each voter is more costly to go after, so they won't.  The people of each state in this Republic vote to have electors for that state cast their ballots for POTUS.  As far as 'they'll adapt', yes, they'll go with the obvious methodology of only spending time and money where there's loads of votes to go after, meaning they won't spend any time or money anywhere outside the 5 biggest states."
NewJerseyuncensored,ffc7c88,t1_ffc6td9,1579793216.0,"I don't have time to respond to all that, but the part about 'at least the election would result in a leader 'the people' want is nonsense - every state has people, this country is a republic, not one large mob, and your system disenfranchises everyone living within the interior.  Only 'the people' of 4 or 5 large state would ever get the leader their people want.  That leads to secession and rebellion.  Each state does have options to decide how their electors vote - I don't see how the interstate compact, which purports to allow one state's electors to disregard the voters of that state and instead cast their ballots according to what voters outside that state do could pass constitutional muster.  It won't, in my opinion."

NewJerseyuncensored,ffc4175,t1_ffa7fhc,1579791002.0,"If you feel like there's a problem with the current system, and that your solution 'fixes' those problems, follow it through and try to envision what elections would be like if your 'solutions' were employed.  No candidate is campaigning anywhere other than Texas, California, Florida and New York.  There wouldn't be any point - they would never ever again show up in Idaho, Montana etc., since there's not enough people to make it worthwhile.  Then what happens in those states that find themselves being ignored by presidential candidates, with no hope of that ever improving?  Maybe they secede?  There's problems either way, but your 'fix' creates problems that are worse than what we have now, in my opinion anyway.  You can't tell everyone living within the interior of this country that they don't and will never have a voice in federal elections.  States where some of the voters are marginalized because their state is reliable red or blue could modify their electoral system like Maine and Nebraska to fix that issue.  Also, there's a pending SCOTUS case now on the issue of 'faithless electors', so your claim that Article II gives states broad powers seems on its face to be correct, for now, but that is an issue that's being addressed now by the court, so we'll see what they decide."

Also, you should know that when you hang yourself, then you shit and piss yourself as a result of your bladder and sphincter relaxing immediately post death, so wear a diaper if you follow through so no one has to cut you down with pee pants and clean up the mess of your shit afterwards.  That would be a humiliating way to be found."
NewJerseyuncensored,ff9zk1i,t3_esaxyg,1579724856.0,"The organizers of the women's march here in Atlantic City moved it inside, because it was going to be cold out that day.  What did they think they'd accomplish by wearing pussy hats and waving signs in a room, inside, full of nothing but other women in pussy hats waving signs?  The organizer said something about the purpose of the event being to make women feel empowered.  OK."
NewJerseyuncensored,ff9y8m8,t1_ff9cxz5,1579724085.0,"I can find you a thousand videos of lefties shouting down a conservative speaker to deny them any opportunity to speak, before you can find me 2 that show mobs of conservatives shouting down a lefty speaker.  Sure, if a group has enough people in it, it will have some assholes in it, but there's a fundamental difference in attitudes of conservatives and 'liberals' in that only liberals feel entitled to use violence and mob tactics to silence opposing views.  I appreciated the author's acknowledging the problems with her becoming enraged at someone else having a different view, but was disappointed she didn't reach the epiphany and instead tried to claim both sides are to blame."
NewJerseyuncensored,ff9xrmw,t1_ff991so,1579723804.0,"No, 'one person one vote' means the hordes of California voters subject the entire interior of the country to their dictates, and that's not fair, that's why the framers opted for a republic style of government.  The interstate compact would get struck down as unconstitutional if and when it is challenged.  One thing you seem to ignore is that in our elections, there's loads of folks who never leave their homes to bother voting in states like NY and Cal, because they know it won't matter, so saying that the final voting numbers somehow would have been the same if some other system were in place ignores reality.  Senators and Governors are elected within each state, same as electors who then cast their electoral votes for President, which reflects the fact that this is a republic."
NewJerseyuncensored,ff99nbs,t1_ff7bk2q,1579708018.0,"OK, but the author also concludes that blame falls on both sides for creating the atmosphere of divisiveness, when that is entirely false.  Ever see the videos of Trump fanatics at one of his rallies swarming Jim Acosta - they're not bashing his head with bike locks or screaming vulgar epithets at him, they crowd around him smiling and taking selfies with him.  Now, show up at a dem candidate's event in a MAGA hat and be prepared for openly hostile verbal and physical abuse.  You can go anywhere you please with a shirt or hat on promoting a dem candidate and at worst you'll get a good natured ribbing - go anywhere in Trump gear and it is a near certainty you'll get punched or something thrown at you - there's an endless parade of incidents like that, close to zero going the other way.  One side feels entitled to dehumanize their opponents and use violence / censorship / fabricated slurs to silence them, conservatives are respectful and will discuss issues calmly and peacefully."
PoliticalHumor,ff98xe5,t1_ff7klvs,1579707564.0,"Considering how you've lapped up the nonsense that the Republican party is racist and hates MLK, the dem party has been successful in propagating the lies that the parties 'switched' and somehow the party that produced the votes to get civil rights legislation passed over dem party obstruction, and freed the slaves over dem party open rebellion and secession, and did away with segregation in the armed forces twice (had to do that a second time after dem pres. Woodrow Wilson brought it back), strong support by African Americans for the dem party goes back to LBJ's famous brag that they'd have them voting dem for the next 200 years.  You expect 90% support this election, given that after 50+ years of dem party control of cities that have shown zero progress in improving the lives of African Americans bu then magically POTUS Trump's policies have gotten them their first real wage growth in decades, lowest unemployment rates in history, sweeping bipartisan criminal justice reforms, and highest rates of home ownership ever?  Trump is polling somewhere in the range of 30% support among likely African American voters - anything north of 15% is game over for the dems in 2020.  Dems aren't getting 90% this election, you can book that.  The lies only sell up until the time those lies are exposed by somebody else coming in and fixing the problems the other guys have sworn they were working to fix for decades without any results."

depression,ff97ttq,t1_ff7y8bs,1579706855.0,"I got a cat.  Sure, meaningful relationships are important, but my advice was aimed more towards not feeling like your own value is measured by whether others seem to value you or not, or how much.  That is doomed to leaving you disappointed, since nearly everyone is self absorbed and won't be bothered to make you a priority - so you have to make yourself a priority, and tune out the negativity or apathy of others.  Maybe it's corny or trite, but if you want others to value you, you have to value you first.  Don't let assholes get you down.  As with most things, of course it's easier said than done so good luck.  If you want an easy 'cheat' go get a dog or cat from the animal shelter, it makes a world of difference to have at least one creature in the world you can always count on to be happy to see you, plus you know you've done something good by giving it a home."

NewJerseyuncensored,ff78vqw,t1_ff77k3e,1579643428.0,We live in a republic - do you think that 48 or so states in the republic should have no voice at all so that 2 or 3 of the big states can have 'super votes'?
PoliticalHumor,ff78j8u,t1_ff76p68,1579643227.0,"I think you're confused about 'left' and 'right'.  The GOP has always been and still is about individual liberties, a government of enumerated and limited powers, strict(er) interpretation of the constitution, and solving social issues through non governmentally imposed solutions.  The dems have always been about loose interpretation of the constitution, expansion of federal governmental power, and imposing solutions to social problems on people and the states through exercise of federal power.  None of that has changed.  GOP members of the house and Senate pushed civil rights and voting rights acts through against stiff opposition by the dem party.  Nixon enacted the clean water act and clean air acts, established the Environmental Protection Agency -and he tried like hell to get the first woman appointed to the US Supreme Court, but was shot down by the very left leaning ABA.  The GOP was never 'to the left of the Democrats', as 'left' means more reliance on government and less individual accountability / liberty.  Why do you try and associate President Trump with neo nazis?  Are you blissfully unaware that his daughter married a man who is Jewish, that he has acknowledged Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, and has Jewish grandchildren?  Doesn't sound like a 'neo nazi' to me, but then facts and reality have never been an obstacle to the dem party's smear tactics.  If you choose to ignore reality and argue the smears fabricated by the DNC it is not worth arguing with you.  Do you have no criticism or concern for Gov. Northam's happily posing for pictures in a KKK outfit and blackface?  No problems with Hillary embracing a former Klan recruiter and Grand Exalted Cyclops as her 'mentor'? Do you honestly believe Hillary is a champion of women's causes despite her relentlessly smearing her rapist husband's victims and destroying their lives to protect her political career?  It seems like dem supporters gladly ignore actual real facts when they do not support the fantasy the DNC is selling, but also gladly accept as fact any and every concocted baseless smear the DNC throws at the R's and their supporters.  Who is it that began the policy of 'babies in cages'?  Which presidential candidate was the first to support same sex marriage as a candidate?  How is it that Biden, Obama, Hillary and many other dems loudly advocated for a border wall and immigration controls, right up until President Trump came into office and actually started taking action on those things?"

The comments on that thread mostly were jackoffs congratulating each other for their master plan of not showing up to the rally to protest, because then there'd be no one at the rally at all and then the lack of crowds would embarrass POTUS Trump.

NewJerseyuncensored,ff74vsq,t1_ff60qci,1579641173.0,"But the author admits that without knowing one single thing about the person in the MAGA hat, they feel compelled to identify that person as a hate filled racist homophobe, dehumanizing them and thereby justifying their violent fantasies.  Only the author is 'triggered' by irrational hate for someone they know almost nothing about, only the author is concocting mental excuses to justify their desire to use violence to harm this person whose only 'offense' is to hold differing views.  The author is admitting to holding the attitudes of an intolerant fascist, and having a hissy fit that their unbridled hate is at odds with what they know deep down in their psyche - which is that others do in fact have the right to disagree.  They don't want others to have the right to disagree with them, because if those differing views are allowed to be expressed, then the lefty is no longer on that esteemed high horse of righteousness and is instead forced to defend their views, and defending those views is hard."
NewJerseyuncensored,ff748sy,t3_ermwx4,1579640806.0,"The entire premise of that article is an imagined world where the right is being hostile and attacking the left, without listening to or considering their views.  That world does not exist anywhere but in the imaginations of the left, who can not admit they are the only ones attacking, the only ones who innately feel hate simply because they find themselves in situations where someone they disagree with is allowed to express their views.  Conservatives do not show up at events featuring left wing advocates and shut the event down with violence, they do not scream hateful unfounded slurs to silence lefties, they do not try to have them blacklisted or branded as hatemongers or subhumans.  Those are all tactics employed by the left nearly exclusively."

'Switched' clearly is flat out wrong, as iirc, it was one house member that switched parties.  Nixon felt like inner city urbanites who were well off and well educated were a ripe target to pry the southern states from the pro union and anti war agendas of the dem party, it was not about racism in any way.  The southerners who were racists still had loud voices within the dem party in Byrd and Gore among many others, not to mention the 'dixiecrats' that supported George Wallace."
