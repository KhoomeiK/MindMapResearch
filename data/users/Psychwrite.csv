nfl,ffh46ud,t1_ffh1xq4,1579922646.0,This has been my takeaway from the Niners turnaround. Jed learned to shut up and let football guys do football stuff. And it's hard to argue with results.
AskReddit,fffk7yi,t1_fffjxpu,1579885753.0,Labs are always backed up though. I bet there's a healthy rotation of substances sitting there for weeks at a time.
funny,ffe7smo,t1_ffdxseh,1579839017.0,"Seriously. I got a call from a friend, who heard from his friend, who heard from his mom, who heard from my mom, who was looking for me, because she heard I got pulled over, *while I was still pulled over*. For an out headlight. Small fuckin towns."
AskReddit,ffe5nr7,t1_ffdqjav,1579837350.0,Sounds like him. I'd call it all but confirmed.
AskReddit,ffe5k0c,t1_ffcki7l,1579837270.0,That's most of his writing. Edgar's a power user and an excellent writer.
AskReddit,ffe4d0r,t1_ffc1ew4,1579836373.0,It has to get weird when you've been around a long time. That or you lose your sense of humor altogether.
AskReddit,ffe493j,t1_ffd28b9,1579836292.0,"This is totally unrelated to this thread, but I (along with some coworkers) was cursed to step on Lego nightly by a self-proclaimed witch a few months ago. I don't own any Lego, unfortunately, so it hasn't come to be. Yet."
nfl,ff7yxkt,t1_ff7xxsn,1579661691.0,For sure man. Love me some local history.

todayilearned,ff4srlg,t1_ff3sa3b,1579571566.0,Love the smirk on Senior's face as Junior crosses the plate. One of my favorite baseball moments.
mildlyinteresting,ff4rg2z,t1_ff4qp8z,1579570653.0,Ok I see. Paper was the important part of OP's post. I glossed right over that and went to the dollar amount.
mildlyinteresting,ff4razo,t1_ff4qb0f,1579570557.0,"More common in the UK/Australia, but some Americans use it."
mildlyinteresting,ff4r7xh,t1_ff4ms5q,1579570500.0,It's a Better Call Saul reference.
mildlyinteresting,ff4qxmz,t1_ff4npgr,1579570304.0,"This was actually an issue when they first introduced the new dollar coins. To get the coins into circulation, you could order them straight from the mint, no limit, credit cards accepted. Pretty quick people figured out you could order as much as your credit limit would allow, rack up insane amounts of airline miles and rewards, then just deposit the coins and pay off the credit card before interest hit. Thousands of coins were distributed, but very few were making it into circulation and they quickly stopped accepting credit cards."
mildlyinteresting,ff4q7ff,t1_ff4pl65,1579569804.0,It's weird y'all got rid of the 20. It's easily the most commonly used bill in the US.
mildlyinteresting,ff4q39s,t1_ff4pl1e,1579569724.0,Cash register.
nfl,fewbjf5,t1_few1fvi,1579407983.0,"Lmao, I'm surprised that song came back to me immediately. It's gotta be a decade or more since I last listened to it."
AskReddit,feolscm,t1_fenm84i,1579301959.0,"And if it's nice, there's some that go out on the lake a bit and you get a really great view of the skyline. Definitely worth it."
AskReddit,fefam4x,t1_fedcjop,1579052090.0,"I bought the Mewtwo Strikes Back soundtrack with my birthday money, that shit was fire."
AskReddit,feeevhj,t1_fecz969,1579032320.0,She definitely did have it. I meant that more as in she didn't need the money and could have kept quiet about her psoriasis.
AskReddit,feclj58,t1_feb5q57,1578976885.0,Cyndi Lauper is awesome. She didn't need to do those psoriasis commercials. Unless there's something I don't know about.
nfl,fe5s66o,t1_fe5rod1,1578873779.0,Pretty much.
nfl,fe5s1au,t1_fe5rrcd,1578873701.0,Not really. Looks like it's gonna be a chippy game though.
nfl,fe54zyq,t1_fe53gpx,1578865719.0,52yd FG attempt to end the half and make it a 1pt game. Nuts.
nfl,fe508qv,t1_fe4xiza,1578864481.0,Lol 24-21. Texans driving. What a wild game.

nfl,fe4dbfr,t1_fe3nd4b,1578858038.0,There were some bad drops by his receivers too. Dude played great.
nfl,fe4ckin,t1_fe2lz3v,1578857875.0,"I haven't watched much of the Titans this year up to the playoffs, but that 50yd TD bomb and that crazy tight throw in the end zone that the WR dropped were all I needed to see to know Tannehill is legit."
funny,fe0t7u5,t1_fe0hz2l,1578818362.0,Hardcore dancing. It looks goofy but it's pretty fun. Plus people get accidentally hit by flailing limbs and it's always funny.
todayilearned,fe0eo10,t1_fe032zo,1578812020.0,Dude wrote so many hits. True legend. Nice guy too.

funny,fdpmtdn,t3_emkw27,1578633109.0,"Well, not doing something, practicing something; there's a difference. Focus on getting better at something for 10,000 hours you'd be pretty good at least."
gifs,fdpl36t,t1_fdpgogj,1578631617.0,Yeah what he ended up doing was plan C lol.
AskReddit,fdi9oci,t1_fdhjd97,1578438245.0,"Don Henley was on a lot of coke back then. Probably doesn't remember writing it. That definitely happened to Steven Tyler from Aerosmith. He heard a song on the radio that he liked and told the band they should cover it. Joe Perry says, ""It's us, you fuckhead."" Mountains of cocaine and gallons of booze make it hard to remember shit lol."
AskReddit,fdcv678,t1_fdcurch,1578285224.0,He's done some stuff lately and dude is just... rough. His voice didn't age well and neither has he. Seems like he's had a hard go. Doubt Me Now and The One and Only are great albums though for sure.
AskReddit,fdcuebw,t1_fdcnyqk,1578284592.0,I honestly can't imagine it. I had a catheter for a short while and it was excruciating putting it in and worse coming out. I dealt with the nasal-gastric tube far better.

nfl,fdcmvsw,t1_fdcmcn3,1578278860.0,I know. Just sayin. It's funny how there's slight differences even in super specific things like that. Language is weird.
OldSchoolCool,fdcm5ub,t1_fdci6jf,1578278349.0,It's looking at me from the shelf after seeing this. Hasn't even been that long since I watched it lol.

nfl,fdb4wle,t1_fdaxl08,1578253871.0,"The article says the very first one found was about Heath Ledger on 4chan, the John Lennon one was several months later, but became more popular, so the meme is named after it."
nfl,fdb42so,t1_fd95u3k,1578253514.0,"I know what wagon I'll be on if the Pack goes out, I can tell ya that much."
nfl,fd63ktk,t1_fd61q9a,1578185057.0,"Ok, yeah I remember that. I'm willing to forgive past transgressions if the person shows remorse and change. He apologized and hasn't done anything even remotely racist in the interim. Most people say and do stupid shit in high school. I certainly did."
todayilearned,fd610hy,t1_fd5j2t2,1578184022.0,Fat fucking marching sticks basically.
nfl,fd60hjp,t1_fd5xaeo,1578183825.0,Gonna need some context on that one bud.
AskReddit,fd5ppe8,t1_fd5jim9,1578180063.0,Yeah maybe you stumbled upon the high roller room or something. I'd've done the same as you though for sure.
AskReddit,fd5mpsm,t1_fd4hrpr,1578179141.0,"A cousin of mine did the same thing with keno (worst odds of any game). His kids were curious about the keno cards so he let them pick some numbers and put 5 bucks down, expecting to teach a lesson about gambling. Won $400 lol. He told his kids they lost, but took them for ice cream sundaes after dinner as a treat."
AskReddit,fd5kdzf,t1_fd46ens,1578178482.0,Craps is really the only table game that breeds camaraderie. Even with roulette people just kinda keep to themselves.
AskReddit,fd5jpsw,t1_fd4knr9,1578178337.0,"Replace ""enough"" with ""with"" and it makes sense. Not sure if that's what they intended, cuz that's a hell of a typo lol."
AskReddit,fd5jat3,t1_fd4o65e,1578178216.0,"Jeez what kind of cruise were you on? Those are crazy minimums. I love a good $5 blackjack table, but $100 is nuts."
AskReddit,fd5j0jk,t1_fd43h5d,1578178118.0,"Yup. I take an amount of cash I'm willing to lose, leave the debit card at home, and call it a good night when I don't go home with nothing. It can be a good time if you go into it with that mindset and avoid the slots. Table games are where it's at."
AskReddit,fd4qmxl,t1_fd2xaot,1578170073.0,"Lol this exact thing happened in a church youth group. Some dude was talking about how this girl at school was a horror, and apparently told her that. I thought he called her a whore, so I was like no shit she doesn't like you, you called her a whore! I was also confused why no one else was reacting much to his story."

Games,fczpqkc,t1_fcznyqw,1578106425.0,Thanks that's some interesting stuff. It's a bummer we have pretty good pictures of that Hellriegel and no other information. It's an interesting design for sure.

nfl,fczi91b,t1_fcyqt8v,1578101834.0,"Yeah I really started paying attention to football in 98 or 99, so I had a good 6 years or so before I started hating the Patriots. Two in a row did it."
Drugs,fczf9zf,t1_fcz3lsp,1578099963.0,Agreed with u/ohbenito. Even at the best of times it can take 2+ months to get your order from them.

todayilearned,fctfb1f,t1_fctd59p,1577941429.0,The whole first season is pretty weak. It tried too hard to be The Office. Season 2 they found their identity and it's all gravy from there.
CFB,fcst39u,t1_fcshkoz,1577924412.0,Don't you put that evil on us. I'm a firm believer that getting ranked 25th was the worst thing for us last year. Not that we actually have to worry about it this time lol
