It is fucking depressing in these places, but again this is not a unique new thing, people are just becoming more exposed to it.

Here is a scenario where it’s in a trench like the YouTube link at one point but still it doesn’t work that way so it just isn’t going to make a tsunami.

Lastly this is an explosive set up that would do it, NOT NUCLEAR BOMBS, that rivals nukes tested during the Second World War.


The way nukes work doesn’t lend it self well to the kind of conditions you need for tsunamis. Supposedly Russia has come up with some sort of device but even then there is doubt whether it would work that way.

Here is the math why even the largest nukes in history donâ€™t have close to enough energy to make a tsunami

Here is a scenario where itâ€™s in a trench like the YouTube link at one point but still it doesnâ€™t work that way so it just isnâ€™t going to make a tsunami. 


https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newzealand/9774217/Tsunami-bomb-tested-off-New-Zealand-coast.html
Lastly this is an explosive set up that would do it, NOT NUCLEAR BOMBS, that rivals nukes tested during the Second World War.


The way nukes work doesnâ€™t lend it self well to the kind of conditions you need for tsunamis. Supposedly Russia has come up with some sort of device but even then there is doubt whether it would work that way.
