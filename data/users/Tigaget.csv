self,feltanw,t1_felrqna,1579230400.0,"And don't worry about how long it takes, either. I had bipolar as a child, and my mother has borderline personality disorder, so my childhood was terrible. I got diabetes at age 26,and lost my job. I was poorly treated for both the bipolar and diabetes until my 30s. I got pregnant at 27,and my daughter had seizures at birth that caused brain damage, so she couldn't go to daycare, so I didn't work for 6 years. I had to move back in with my mother. I was Baker acted at 33,and finally got on appropriate bipolar medication. After my mental health stabilized, I was able to take care of my diabetes. I got a good job. I went back to college. I did OK Cupid and met a good man. I graduated college at age 40 and started working in a professional career. I got married. I got a better job. My husband and I bought a $250,000 house. I'm able to take care of my daughter and retired mother. My life is really great at age 45. I took me 30 years to get to this point, and I didn't know if I would make it some times. I gave up. I failed some classes. I got fired for calling in too many times at work. But, each time, I would try again. And while my life isn't perfect, it's the best life over ever lived. You can get there, too."

self,felql07,t3_ept97z,1579228530.0,"Man, that sucks. You can get treatment for depression, so that's actually good. Maybe your dad will have more time to spend with you now that he's not in a stressful relationship, so that could work out. And man, your ex is crazy enough to date a Russian? You dodged a bullet there.  You'll get through this dude."

offmychest,felb3v9,t3_epndfj,1579218031.0,"At 45, my field of fucks is barren, and the boost to my confidence is amazing. I graduated college 5 years ago, and have switched jobs 5 times from junior Staff accountant to my new job I started this week as a senior staff accountant supervising two staff accountants. After the age of 40, you start to trust your own judgement, and you realize that perfect is the enemy of good. It's not that you half ass stuff because you're lazy, but because in the end, it just doesn't make a material difference if you give 80% instead  of 125%.  I'm 230 lbs, 5'7"" and have a mom haircut. I'm not stunningly beautiful, but I'm presentable. I don't even wear make up anymore. But because I'm confident in myself, my skills and my knowledge, I'm successful. Also, I cannot stress the importance of working with employment agencies like Robert Half when job hunting. I've never held a job I wasn't presented to by an agency. But every time I've finally gotten an interview, I've been hired.

Hang in there, young adults. You've got this."

self,fdp3gfa,t3_emdcb6,1578619095.0,"I'd recommend some cognitive behavioral therapy specifically related to your obsessive behaviors. I did CBT 30 years ago, and still use the scripts and techniques when life gets mega stressful. You have to have a plan of attack when you engage in these behaviors. First off, shut the phone off when you over text.

When I start getting into an everyone hates me mindset, I talk, out loud, to myself listing my good qualities, the people who don't hate me, why the people who hate me aren't quality people to have in my life, etc."
