He did everything you said (he had a skill at making simple saves be highlight reel saves) but was unbelieveable at stopping the puck.  Flopping doesnt mean ""bad"", it's just a style.  If it works for you, great, and my god did it work for him.  So yes its flopping...let me find my pen."
todayilearned,ff66oav,t1_ff5axbv,1579620420.0,It's not cheating if it's legal.  They didnt start changing the rules to limit pad and Jersey size until way after he retired.

todayilearned,ff4f441,t1_ff4dong,1579562107.0,"Roy ""introduced"" a hybrid style close to butterfly before Brodeur and Hasek.  Brideur is his own hybrid style and hasek was a flop goalie."
