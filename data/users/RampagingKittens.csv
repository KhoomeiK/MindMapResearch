MakeupAddiction,ffx8r2o,t1_ffwlkw0,1580320108.0,"Oh, I know. But with that much surface area being exposed every time it's opened, it will dry up faster than it would in a tube. Speaking from experience."
MakeupAddiction,ffwfm7a,t1_ffvwv1m,1580299221.0,This doubled the life of my Nars radiant creamy concealer. The stopper lets me access so much more product.
MakeupAddiction,ffwfkaq,t1_ffw12ga,1580299162.0,"Not to be a Debbie Downer, but without it being in a tube it will dry up a lot faster. You may find yourself wishing to throw the product out because it becomes difficult to spread. A fresh primer potion is actually very thin and wet, and I find myself forgetting this because by the time I you can get close to the end of the tube it's become so much thicker and dryer. That said, I would still do the same as you and cut the bottle open because it's still worth using up as much as the product as you can!"
AskReddit,ffwep5x,t1_ffv8ukf,1580298161.0, Why are so many of the words used for baby animals so fucking cute? Kittens! Puppies!
AskReddit,ffwdnm1,t1_ffvx2cl,1580296862.0,"The USA and Canada are working on developing a new product that can somewhat help with this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_9-1-1

It also takes advantage of a lot of technologies (such as using your phone's camera to show emergency services what you're seeing, texting 911 because you can't use your phone during an active shooting, etc).

NG911 is set to release quite soon in Canada, with features being added over time as required or dreamt up."
SkincareAddiction,ffvw9z3,t1_ffub7o8,1580275189.0,"I think this is the biggest group in the sub, tbh. I'll expand it by lumping in the people who have a variety of products but only use a small subset based on their current needs (eg a thicker moisturizer in winter, a lighter one in summer).

I keep a variety of each kind of product because my skin has different needs depending on the time of year, whether or not I wore makeup that day, whether I'm using my retinol, if I have my period, or if I just I need some extra hydration because I got off a plane. That doesn't mean I'm using all of them every day, but they come and go into my routine as needed. Could I get it done with just three or four products? Sure, but for a little bit extra performance and a lot more convenience, I can select the product that exactly fits my current needs."
muacjdiscussion,ffvrudj,t3_evae1g,1580271472.0,"I generally prefer sticking with mid to high end. There's too many drugstore complexion products that break me out and/or I can't shade test (because no samples in Canada), to make the expense worth it. So, it's just easier for me to generally not fuss with the drug store. Exception is mascara!"
