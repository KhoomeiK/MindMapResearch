Ignoring all of the damage that was done to minority communities is key in fighting Affirmative Action.  Even if we assume that there are no racial biases in hiring (a big ""if""), the hurdles put in front of minorities within their own lifetimes, not to mention their parents' and grandparents', severely limit their ability to do things that look good on a resume, among many other things.

In a capitalist society, just as capital can accrue interest and make more capital, previous problems compound to create future problems and prevent future opportunities.  Avoiding committing previous wrongs is not enough, and admitting that there are ongoing wrongs committed against minorities is a bridge too far for some people, much less trying to repair the wrongs of the past."
