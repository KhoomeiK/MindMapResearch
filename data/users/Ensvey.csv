The Underworlds were the first immersive sim games - they're often forgotten about in the face of System Shock, but I found Underworld to be even more immersive.

Nioh,felaldg,t1_fel7aab,1579217696.0,"I've been sticking to odachi mostly because it IS fun for me, but I'm trying to find what other fun the game has to offer :) and I'm assuming sword is popular because it's both effective AND fun, so I just wanted to figure out why so I could enjoy it also, especially since I do now have enough samurai points to near-max 2 weapon trees. I will keep experimenting!"
Nioh,fela89e,t1_fel61zi,1579217463.0,"Thanks, good points. I do agree that the standard, non-skill moves of the sword have very good flow. I think it's just the skills that don't sound good to me on paper, which is really just me needing to practice more. 

I've had a great time with the odachi, just trying to branch out a bit. Odachi may be cumbersome, but when you get used to the timing, it doesn't feel so clumsy and you can do some great burst damage from some great range."

Witcher 3 is surely one of the most famous recent examples of top notch storytelling. I couldn't get enough of it, and felt a literal hole in my life when it was over.

Warren Buffet's point is not that he necessarily would do an unethical thing, but that the principles of capitalism show that tons of people will do the unethical thing if they could get away with it, so it's sort of a moot point whether he personally would. That's why we need regulations.

Similarly, that's why we need taxes, because we can't rely on people to willingly give enough of their money towards the betterment of society unless they're coerced."
