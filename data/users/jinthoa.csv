PleX,fckxmbh,t1_fckihql,1577735379.0,"I had the same issue as you, so I went for an easy fix and bought apple TV + infuse app. Now even with subtitles, only direct play. Saved a lot of money on the server side by doing that. 

4K apple tv are pretty cheap nowadays, infuse pro has a yearly subscription but it's worth it. 

Plex client are not really good and transcoding is a pain."
