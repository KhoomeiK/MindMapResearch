I myself would neither spay nor neuter my dog, but I don't see people who do in the same way as someone who chops their dogs tail off (which serves no medical purpose)

I mean, I don't judge people for spaying/neutering since both have longevity benefits and serve a real purpose. Cosmetic tail docking is wrong.
