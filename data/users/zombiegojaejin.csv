Just as the answer to ""how canz we ever havez fun with different skillz levelzzzzz?"" can be resolved by consulting the long history of golf and longer history of Go, the answer to AP is found in every single ""lifestyle game"" that people put the most thought into. *Of course* they use timers.

I'm a tournament Scrabble player. Outside of a tournament, we still always use timers, and it doesn't hamper the social situation at all. We play with clocks in restaurants, bars, on the beach. If someone goes to the bathroom or their food arrives, the clock can get paused. The clock is still vital to ensure that the game lasts 40-50 minutes instead of 200."

The worse game (by far) of **Codenames** that I've ever played. The less said, the better.

**Sagrada**. Cool concepts, pretty game, but I think I'll inevitably still favor Azul, for the major reason that having some games end on a rush strategy while others turn into a long, high-scoring affair, make each game more memorable.

**Penguin Party** Knizia goes about as simple and light as imaginable and makes quite a wonderful filler.

**Vast: Crystal Caverns"""" First play of my new copy, coming over from Root. Teaching to three smart gamers who knew nothing about it going in. Major rules error, as expected, but this favored the goblins and the cave player still won.

Unqualified recommendation is usually **Broom Service**: theme and simple rules work for families, interaction can be perceived as light, fun take-that risk taking, or pursued as a deep mind game, depending on the players."

It's the type of chance that comes up in Clank! that bothers me. Certain early cards on the market give a big early lead, and the game is designed to snowball that lead by giving a first comer the best treasure. Meanwhile, if you see that you're behind on the main path and opt for the side path, luck of the shuffle will determine whether you get through or (almost) completely waste a turn. If you know Dominion, every game of Clank! feels like Familiar is in the kingdom, and someone always draws the 2P hand and is effectively eliminated at the beginning of a long game. The single most obnoxoously random Dominion card, and an entire game manages to evoke the same feeling."
