Hahahaha. I love when you win the argument so the other person just backtracks to suit themself. It's been fun, honestly, but I've gotta go talk to people who have at least half a brain, so I'm terribly sorry but I won't be replying to you. Cheers!"

My tragedy of a username? A common phrase used in movies? That I made 6 years ago as a kid? Makes it so I have no morale high ground?

Oh. That's strange. Almost like reading a username gives you precisely fuck all insight into the other person. Funny that!"

ADHD,fff57y7,t1_ffep5jb,1579876011.0,"I absolutely feel the same. 

I grew up in a heavily religious household going to church 3 times a week, so I've always been told to stay in line. I wasn't allowed to have my hair how I wanted, I couldn't have a girlfriend, I couldn't go to certain events with my friends because they were ""evil"" things... It festered until I left the church at 16 as a great disdain for authority, more of being told what to do (it's also part of the reason I wasn't diagnosed as child, I was always so scared of getting in trouble for not doing what I was told that my symptoms went unnoticed).

 I'm not a bad person (never been in trouble with the police either), but when I'm told how to control myself, act, or do something, it instantly makes me push back against whoever is trying to tell me what to do, not because I don't want the help or advice, but it's just something I can't control until I think about my actions later on. And it always makes me feel like an idiot. 

I want to have the ability to control myself and my actions without feeling held back by my mental health. It's an issue I guess a lot of us have to deal with, and it really sucks."
