E: For any passerby's who want to know what I'm cooking up. These are coconut cordial experiemtlents. One uses plain white sugar, the other uses piloncillo. Right now they're just coconut milk slurry and I'm testing sugar levels in small batches to see if I can achieve a fairly sweet final beverage. 

If I had 2 more jars I would test leaving the flakes in vs. not, maybe that will be a test for a later day if these turn out under-sweetened.
////

I got these jars as a present and bought these silicone fermentation lids to use with them but I'm not sure if these lids are just...bad. 

When I push down on the top I can feel air escaping the sides of the lid. I'm guessing this isn't normal? I also shook the jars to get some airflow inside to help the yeast out and some of the slurry escaped the sides.

I guess that's mission failure, gotta restart. Anyone have experience with these lids can give me some tips on what I should and shouldn't encounter?"

Compromise is a thing, if you have to have a set time to hang out and do's and dont's of things during that time, do it, you just have to say that. I doubt he realizes the severity of it, so depression talk, possibility of moving on talk etc. 

I also believe even though you say you'd be fine with staying in that you both should get off your lazy asses and do stuff. At home, you're doing the same shit (although there are things you can share inside together, cooking, playing a co-op game even a puzzle, etc. things that are actual activities), outside you can make memories much easier.

Talking about it is one thing but listening to a whole radio show is another. 

Also, the movie thing, that's their preference. I honestly hate people forcing me to watch genres I don't like. I like different ones to my parents so only the overlapping genres that we can watch, we watch. There's nothing saying you have to interact with your parents if it's going to be something you both don't enjoy. 

I think you're overreacting slightly, in the case of going out that's the only thing I can agree on. Why did you force yourself to rock climb instead of just...not? In that case ""Jim"" should step in and suggest every other time you guys doing something that everyone can tolerate or something that's one of the other person's interests."
