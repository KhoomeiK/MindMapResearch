 No, in fact a large portion of historians outside the US universally reject the „a bombs made Japan surrender“ without arguing that the Americans were evil. 

The question up to debate is how much the bomb influence the surrender. Only idiots argue it was alone the reason for surrender but also idiots argue it had no impact. 

We know exactly what the Japanese government discussed in August 1945 and the a bomb was one topic, the Soviet attacking Manchuria was one (after all the Soviets were the main channel Japan had for vain attempt to negotiate peace and Japan had millions of soldiers stranded in China) and the general hopelessness of sitting on an island on the brink of starvation with nothing to stop enemy air attacks.

Whatever the case is, once the war in China happened several politicians tried stopping it and even in the military quite a few commanders saw in China a natural ally and not an enemy. However, due to the rapid successes and failed attempts at finding a compromise the attempts failed and Japan went full in on the war. The Emperor without a doubt could have done more to strengthen the politicians who wanted peace. 
Just a torn Japan was on the topic of China shows in the fact that they had no concrete war goals. Occupying all of China was impossible since the already conquered parts were tough to get a hold on despite several hundred thousand Chinese collaborator troops.
Getting a peace ok - but how much would Japan take from China? Which parts are actually beneficial and which could they give back without looking weak?

todayilearned,ffcn84e,t1_ffc1tuy,1579803043.0,"That is partially a myth though. 

Not only did Germany unlike Japan fought till the enemies took over their homelands, the Japanese regular soldiers also did surrender in masses like against the soviet armies in Manchuria.

The low number of prisoners in pacific were often due to Japanese elite soldiers fighting but also due to American Marines refusal to take prisoners. 
There were some cases of fake surrender and this led Marines to just kill all Japanese on sight.
Just think about it - even people wanting to die will be just wounded and incapacitated regularly and can then be taken prisoner. Japanese also treated their wounded soldiers. Yet, in some battles basically no prisoners at all. 

In Okinawa American soldier were encouraged and rewarded for taking prisoners and they took several thousand subsequently. On one hand showing lower troop quality left on the Japanese side, on the other side showing Americans planning for the occupation and seeing the worth of prisoners. Still, fewer surrenders as with most other armies so it is of course partially true"

So far for very common knowledge.


Aside from that I dont know how to explain a simple growth graph to you. If you have time on one end and wealth per capita on the other than at any given point there is a finite amount of wealth. Its that simple and you just said exactly the same thing. An upwards slope is exactly a slope with fixed points and delta growth per unit of time. 

As for your „they won’t have anything to buy and real estate will be worthless“. Yes, at some fringe point, population will be so low that everything collapses. No economist believed this will happen to shrinking countries.
Also you talking about the world market is a good point here - wealth of the people of a country in a global economy is not completely tied to that country itself. If banks, investors and citizens have large amounts of savings in oversea money/stocks/real estate the citizens dont rely on the domestic market for production of said wealth. ;)"
AskReddit,ff39i6f,t1_ff359sh,1579536847.0,"No, no. It’s the pretty common economic theory about wealth per capita and the reason why declining birth rates made us so rich in comparison to our ancestors. 

No, wealth isn’t a zero sum game since the total can be enhanced or lost but at any given time there is a finite amount of it. Just think about parents having a house, a nice car and 100k on their account. Now they die and have 5 kids or they have 1 kid. Big wealth per capita difference.

The wealth of a country like Japan will partially decrease if the population drops since more wealth might be lost than what is newly created but overall it will be a great thing for wealth per capita. 
That is why all countries with high birthrates invest in getting them down and why the right-wing/communist ideological idea of „many children“=„strong country“ is so flawed outside of having enough cannon fodder for a war."
AskReddit,ff2v356,t1_ff2fhe6,1579525317.0,"Economically a declining population is amazing. Wealth distributed over the same amount of people.

The problem is the transformation process with the costs of caring for (in %) more elderly people over a smaller amount of working people."
freefolk,fez4l9r,t1_feyh7fr,1579453794.0,"It’s the phantom menace symptom but much harder.


When the phantom menace came out a lot of people were in denial „it isn’t that bad, it was kind good and I want to see how it continues“. This was season 7... it obviously sucked but people could t admit it. Then attack of the clones (season 8) came along and people realized they are in something bad.

The difference is that the prequels we’re still great for kids and had a third movie to somewhat redeem themselves. GoT ended with the biggest turd."
Documentaries,fez1836,t1_feyp8x6,1579452964.0,"German here and legalization and acknowledgement as a regular business failed. 

I prefer the approach of prostitution being a strongly controlled and local government regulated work. Make prostitution highly illegal, unless it’s happening with a license and in a place the city controls itself. 

Even this will not get completely rid of pimping, trafficking and abusive relationships but at least if makes it difficult and provides a  safe space for prostitutes. Also it means the government gets the taxes from that work. Prostitutes make good money since most don’t pay taxes."
MovieDetails,feyk2ct,t1_feyjcwb,1579446565.0,Apparently not - some people legitimately think its genius.
MovieDetails,feyeaif,t3_equvg6,1579444299.0,Wait - this doesnt add up at all...
MovieDetails,feye6ri,t1_feybl24,1579444266.0,"No. The force awakens was far better.
And dont give me that „its just line Epsiode 4“. There are some striking similarities to the original trilogy (not just one movie) but the main plot was not the same and it isnt like the last Jedi wasnt reusing some existing stuff from the OT."
MovieDetails,feyddc1,t1_fey2rb0,1579444087.0,"The worst. My wife wanted an apology later for me dragging into this mess, the women next to us in theater made sounds like she lost faith in humanity. 
Not ti mention the laughs at Leia‘s scene.

As a positive note - it helped me see the good in Episode 1 again. The feeling of a great adventure with creative worlds is also completely absent from last jedi which cloned hoth but didnt do anything with it and then the casino... oh god."
MovieDetails,feyctwo,t1_fexz6xz,1579443874.0,"Why? Seriously, why? Because it makes for a cool montage later?
Or does it provide something to the movie?"
MovieDetails,feyclmi,t1_feybr05,1579443791.0,Yeah. Super awful. Not even to mention that it was pretty pointless for the plot and them escaping the situation of the rebel fleet rendering the main plot even more absurd
MovieDetails,feychgd,t1_feybn8h,1579443735.0,"First point is good but then again Rey and Finn and Poe are all new characters with at this point new families. 

The war profit stuff was super shallow in my perception. Not to forget them freeing some animals and not the slave children..."

Or better part of the Holy Roman Empire. 
People in the Sudetenland and Austria called themselves German and wanted to be part of Germania.

You do exactly the same mistake as the Allies here - the self-determination of people which was one of Wilson’s main points needs to also be applied to the losers of a war or its just an empty phrase."
