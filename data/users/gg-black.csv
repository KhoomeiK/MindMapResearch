AaronHernandez,ff7nr8g,t3_eqou8k,1579653963.0,"I agree. I notice he’s on this ID show too.  I think that was just some high school teen exploration. 
I think Aaron was a sociopath and/or narcissist and they’ll do anything for their own gratification. The timing of his suicide is interesting- 2 days after he was supposedly exposed. Like he couldn’t deal with the humiliation. Just my opinion."
AaronHernandez,ff7n8w8,t1_ff5z6c6,1579653605.0,Me too! I’m glad someone brought this up. That was the only time he was clearly showing anything. It said he turned around 6 times. I thought it was sad Kraft never looked at him.

bloodpressure,fdka1s7,t3_eimud0,1578499460.0,"I just started on it the second time and I’ve never felt so crummy. Shortness of breath when going upstairs or across a room. Lightheaded, nausea and too tired to do anything. I’m giving it a week and going back since I feel worse every day. This is why I stopped taking it before. My dr said I just have to give my body a chance to function at a lower bp but it hasn’t come down that much."
