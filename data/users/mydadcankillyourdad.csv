depression,fevn7kk,t1_fevbp7j,1579399242.0,"It's fine. Never be sorry for expressing your feelings. And I dont think you have bad luck. Maybe you were dealt a bad hand, but maybe, one day, you'll win at the uno game of life, and be happy that you didnt give up even with all the cards stacked against you!"
depression,fev9g7h,t3_eophbs,1579394726.0,"Being good and positive wont help stop the suffering, but having a goal to look forward too might lessen it a little. Think of a goal you want to achieve. Let's say, since you're 16, you try to reach 18 as a goal. And when you hit that, set another goal: 21 birthday. When you hit a goal, make a new one. Graduate, date, marry, have kids. It all can be set as a goal, cause then you have something to fight towards, and then someone to fight for. This is what helped my brother. He tried to commit when he was 17, my age now, but when the time came, he realized he had goals that he wanted to fight for. And now, at the age of 23, he is in college to be a teacher abroad, to help children in underdeveloped countries. Fight for something, live for yourself and your goals."

AskReddit,fbq1s52,t3_ee3b1i,1577027483.0,"I just realized that my friends have abandoned me. I knew it was coming but I tried so hard to stop it. They replaced me with another person who I thought we were all friends with. Turns out I was wrong.

It hurts knowing that I'm not wanted anymore by the people who I loved the most. I have really bad social anxiety, so having them as friends helped me. But now, I feel myself slinking back into myself, and it hurts knowing all the progress I worked for is gone. I even blame myself for them leaving me. I think that I could of done more or said more, but I dont k know.

Okay, rant over. Sorry to bother, just needed to get it off my chest."
