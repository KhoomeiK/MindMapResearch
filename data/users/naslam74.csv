quittingphenibut,fe8et7p,t3_en53jo,1578925389.0,"The withdrawals are real. I went on a solo vacation and took 1500-1800mg a day for 10 days to increase my vacation “good feelings”. When I got back home I stopped taking it not really thinking I would feel any kind of withdrawal. 

I woke up in the middle of the night maybe 2 days after I stopped taking it feeling completely disassociated with intense ringing in my ears and horrific anxiety. I had a few Valium which I had lying around but it did absolutely nothing. The anxiety was so intense that I’m not sure if anxiety is the correct word. I’ve had panic attacks in the past but this was like a whole new level of panic, fear, and dread.

My thoughts were muddled for the following week and I could sometimes hear voices. I was convinced I was becoming a schizophrenic. It was the scariest time in my life I can remember as I really thought I was going to have to go to a psychiatric ER. 

It eventually subsided. Of course I’m stupidly back on Phenibut now for the past 3 months and I’m at 900mg a day. I bought Baclofen just Incase the withdrawals come back as I taper down. 

Phenibut is no joke."
