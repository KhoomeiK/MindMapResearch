YouShouldKnow,fg9f30n,t1_fg8j9vr,1580637981.0,"Compulsory sterilization was a legal disaster. Forcing people to do something in order to breed was a disaster. Advocacy has always been needed. Look up adultism. In the Victorian era, 5 yr olds worked in factories and lost limbs and it was legal. 

Today, children are still targeted for other things because adults can not control themselves, especially power hungry men who want to control who breeds. Women will always have that power. You don’t need smarts or money to have a functioning uterus but by nature women will always have the power in our race. Men hate and want to control that."

I commute daily on public transportation in a major American city since high school well into my 20s. Now as a mom at 32, my daily commute consists of being yelled at by either passengers or drivers about my stroller, mostly old men of all races. the baby in the stroller has gotten shoved by college students, shoved by old ladies on purpose. My kid is 8 months old now. It feels like years bc of daily micro aggressions toward stroller from men and women of all shapes and colors. 

Because I work at a well known company, people on the buses will sometimes recognize me bc I handle a lot of stuff at work... they know me, I don’t know them necessarily, so I am not stating this in hate. I cannot afford to lose my temper in public when everyone else does. I call my transit company every time there was a conflict for their surveying needs. It’s an OPERATIONAL issue. No empathy wanted here. If I am wrong... look at what Europe is up to. Some people have it figured out.

TrueOffMyChest,fg8ed9f,t1_fg7gi91,1580617019.0,"Yes it’s real because I grew up liberal and worked in a very liberal place where in a private meeting when I was asking for pregnancy accommodation I was called out for using the wrong pronoun when addressing somebody. These are people who would give me a hard time to go to the bathroom to throw up when I was pregnant. Everyone is for equality and everything but they seem to forget that a pregnant woman is the embodiment of what it means to be a the female gender... Yet we are treated horribly by the left who has abortion rights as their core values. This on paper is fantastic but you really just have a society that treats you like a sinner if you ARE pregnant, especially if u are in school. It’s really getting out of hand.

YouShouldKnow,fg8d1jx,t1_fg799ml,1580615942.0,You’d be surprised what children go through in public. I had a newborn in a stroller in a public bus and the bus driver said I was not allowed to enter unless I folded my stroller. There was no one to hold the baby for me to fold the stroller. Newborns can’t even hold their own head up and I was expected to put the baby down somewhere while I folded the stroller. Policy as it relates to children in transportation is a joke.  Everyone has experience that moment when the stroller is about to enter a bus or a plane and everyone clenches up. Imagine being the parent who commutes on public transportation. The nightmare for the caretaker is never ending and nobody cares. Just two days ago I entered a bus where no one would fold the seat up for me to put the stroller in the space. So they actually got up but didn’t put their seat up and I couldn’t get to it because my stroller was in the aisle so it was just me waiting for somebody to wake up. When a homeless man told the woman to put the seat up she wouldn’t. I don’t know if it’s a class thing or what but people with children are political punching bags of everyday people who don’t think their actions will be noticed.

But I would like to touch upon what you mentioned about you possibly being a reminder of her worst day. Because my mom still had to see my dad I can see why she hated me especially because I looked a lot like him. In my case my daughter looked a lot like her dad who did this terrible thing and I had a hard time coming to terms with it so I was in therapy and after about four months I didn’t have those feelings of reminders any more by looking at her. 

The major factor that puts you at an advantage is that your father was never around. When my kid’s father completely cut contact with me and never met the child it was a contributor to me not having feelings of reminders when I saw her. I’m not saying it’s a good thing when fathers disconnect completely but in the situation you are illustrating about your mom being reminded of the worst day of her life, It’s just not something you have to worry about. That is because he is so disconnected. I just think you should keep it that way. It sounds like you are doing that anyway."
