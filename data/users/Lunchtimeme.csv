PewdiepieSubmissions,ffg0u3d,t1_ffe93rp,1579896015.0,The M1 Garand is the most recent one that I know of ... and that was WW2

gaming,ff3m9hy,t3_erf4c9,1579544066.0,Inb4 ALL of the anticipated games of 2020 get released on the same fricking day.

facepalm,fer36l6,t1_fen95wj,1579349211.0,"What you feel like is kinda irrelevant here. Some people will never know love. My uncle is one of those, I may very well be one of those (but I'm still young enough to have a chance).

I think personally that every human deserves at least some ammount of love and respect, problem is nobody is obliged to give even a shred of either of those to anyone, nor should they be."
facepalm,fer2rj1,t1_fenctnb,1579349008.0,"Sure, assault by penetration may very well get the same sentence but what about assault by forcing a man to have sex against his will WITHOUT penetrating him in any way?

Can you find me how often does a women get a life sentence for having sex with a man who did not want to have sex with her? How often does she even get sentenced at all? (Obviously you can't find how often it goes unreported in the first place although I wager that's the biggest bottleneck)"
facepalm,fen6am9,t1_fen2f37,1579277916.0,"A shame when you think about it ... not about this particular person but about the whole situation.

There ISN'T someone for everyone."
facepalm,fen2bd2,t1_fen1ouv,1579275397.0,"Except that's a real problem, massively correlated with poverty, crime etc."
facepalm,fen13b3,t1_femdvtf,1579274609.0,"I think it does diminish the sentencing of other assaults, doesn't it?

Why would they have this twisted definition if not for the reason to legally give women lower sentences for it?"
ValveIndex,femv3nu,t1_femib6i,1579270406.0,"Yep, same thing for me, I get sick easily in a car and even more on a bus (unless driving) but not in VR.

The only thing that made me sick so far was 1. excessive smooth locomotion backwards while looking over my shoulder in Payday 2 and 2. low FPS in DCS World."
PewdiepieSubmissions,feh79i2,t3_eoygtz,1579110617.0,"What sort of idiot even comes up with this conclusion?

Rich people go to museums and theaters...

Rich people live longer ...

Therefore museums and theaters help you live longer...

REALLY? Could it not POSSIBLY be something else that helps you live longer in this situation?"
facepalm,fedp6j6,t1_fecb0qe,1579016873.0,"This may be located in the UK.

In that case your statement ""it can happen to both sexes"" is not entirely true because the legal definition of rape is ""being forcefully penetrated by a penis or other object"" so the only way a man can get raped is either by another man or if she decides to shove a dildo up his arse.

This is also the reason why you look at statistics and come to the conclusion that ""women get raped more often than men"" ... because under that definition ... of course they do."
beatsaber,fe22ar1,t3_enmi3g,1578833748.0,"I've had the game since launch (on PC)

That's what it's supposed to do.

It was like this from the very start."
facepalm,fdmpy66,t1_fdlh9x8,1578560017.0,"Doesn't even have to be trolls.

People just do surveys to make a quick buck on the side.

They don't care about the survey, just the money they make from it so what do they do? Just click the map, no need to read the question."
wholesomehentai,fdmpfjy,t1_fdlgkm3,1578559317.0,"I didn't know that but my post doesn't say which came first.

I guess ""based on"" does say that, huh. So the Manga is based on a doujin.

Also didn't know she was female."
wholesomehentai,fdlf18u,t3_elz4gr,1578522620.0,"This is based on the safe for work ecchi manga ""Ane naru mono""

And the author of that manga is the one drawing his own hentai which is always nice to see.

What's also nice to see is apparently ""Ane naru mono"" is getting an anime adaptation now."
beatsaber,fdhoq3x,t1_fdhmwsg,1578427117.0,"I also use some translation as well as rotation.

Basically I'm kinda matching the sabers to the laser pointer of the controller in the SteamVR overlay."

Or multiples of each?"

wholesomehentai,fde02q8,t1_fddsh1w,1578328114.0,"I would have never guessed that the mobile app has different rules.

Thanks for the explanation but I'm not going to use imgur, my tracking and ad blockers make that page completely unusable. I guess I'll just read my hentai without contributing, there's enough others to do that.

Thanks again for the info."
wholesomehentai,fda8grh,t1_fd9nk3f,1578242970.0,"Hmm ... so the image already has to be somewhere else on reddit and then I can link to it?

Cause I think uploading to reddits image hosting is done by creating an image post, which is not allowed in this subreddit."
wholesomehentai,fd9muwj,t1_fd9m0pk,1578235478.0,"So why are image posts not allowed, why do you only allow to post links?

Or am I doing something wrong here?"
wholesomehentai,fd9lshq,t1_fd9bzcc,1578235094.0,"Wait what?

What's the point of this subreddit then?"
ValveIndex,fcqt10d,t1_fcldnch,1577891758.0,"Most often Beat Saber and now Pistol Whip.

With all the others in a variety just not as much as those two.

Recently started playing ""Until you fall"" which is pretty nice and replaced Sairento for the moment as my third most played game etc.

About every other day."

Who is she? Where did she come from?"
ValveIndex,fck2ui4,t1_fcjxzg8,1577714920.0,"That's unlucky.

I'd probably be quite pissed too if mine started having any of these issues but so far so good though it's only been half a year. We'll see if they start acting up, I hope not."
ValveIndex,fcjv1fq,t1_fcjm6nt,1577706121.0,"What sort of people you talk to?

I've had my Index since launch and never had any of those issues. Not only that I've not heard from anyone personally who did have any of these issues though I've seen a reddit post here and there about it.

Why would anyone lie about it either? It would be kind of obvious in a multiplayer game if someones stick began drifting or got stuck in a certain position, same with a broken trigger or poor tracking. I can only imagine someone in Pavlov just starts walking off in one direction shooting out all of his ammo while his VR hands are spazzing around all over the place."
