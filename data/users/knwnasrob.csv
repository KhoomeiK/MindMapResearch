AskReddit,ffggjtj,t3_etfufm,1579905738.0,"My wife and I got married at age 20 back in 2010. I feel like I can offer up some input in this.   


First off, I don't recommend getting committed that young. I do want to say, my wife and I are very happy now. We love each other and appreciate the companionship that we provide each other. I have two degrees and a job paying six-figures and she has a stable career and is pursuing her masters. We are good. But with that said, you really do miss out on a lot that I feel needs to be taken into consideration.   


We met back in community college in 2008, our first semester out of High School. She moved in in 2009 due to her over bearing parents constantly trying to monitor us. We got married in 2010. When we first met I was going to school still debating what to do. I told myself, I would never have an awful office job just sitting at a desk every day for the next 40+ years of my life. But when the time came to make the decision (2010), I realized that I now also have a responsibility to my wife as well. It was no longer just me, it was now me and her. So I went with the ""safe"" option and went into Accounting. Yeah, I know this is the stable direction and now I make a good salary and have a good foundation for future employment but I can not shake the ""what if"" aspect of it.   


Let's backtrack a bit to the actual college experience. When you are married at 20, there pretty much isn't one. I wasn't going to dorm with another guy when I was married, especially when the University was actually suffering from a shortage of dorms so married couples weren't able to have a dorm together or with strangers. And then the after school activities? Null. I didn't have time to go to the bar after class and flirt around and have fun with my friends. I had a foundation to build, I went to work everyday right after class. I didn't even make any friends at the University because our lives were so different and unable to be related. So that soured that.   


Lets also talk about the inevitable, people change.   
When my wife and I met, we were both broke 18 year old's enjoying each others time. As time went on we did decide what we wanted. I wanted a nice lifestyle, I like to move up in life. I will admit that I have jumped jobs 4 times in the past 2 years. But that is also how I went from making $50K a year to more than double that. My wife? Well when we first got together she wanted to be a nurse and 3 years after we got married she decided she actually wanted to be a physical therapist.  But turns out she is awful at math and biology. She failed both intro to biology and the math classes at our community college multiple times. At this time, she decided that she just wanted an easy job and living in an apartment her whole life is fine. It is also worth noting, we live in an area where a standard 3BA/2BA costs almost a million. She makes $45K a year as a secretary, taking what is one of the easier Masters courses that may raise her to a job making maybe $60K a year. Of course, like I said, we love each other. We are making it work, I'm still trying to move up in hopes of being able to afford a house. I accepted that it really is up to me to get us to house buying level. I contribute $7K a month to our house fund due to my salary, she contributes $1,600. But we make it work. In contrast, I see some of my friends who waited till they got married in their late 20's to make sure they were compatible. My go-getter friends were able to find go-getter wives. My more chill friends were able to find more chill wives. It does make me a bit envious at times, I see my friends who pull in $250\^ a year combined with their wives because they were able to find partners already well into their careers and also use that as a factor in deciding whether to date or not. Getting into a serious relationship young can be more of a game of chance, you can marry someone who wants to be a Physical Therapist and ends up wanting to chill and be a secretary instead and vice versa. Or you can marry someone who 3 years later decided to dedicate herself to the Cult of Cthulhu, so I am thankful that did not happen.   


The actual dating  is also worth talking about. You meet people in your life, whether its at school, work or social occasions. When you commit yourself so young, it is hard to not think about ""What if"" constantly. I made friendships with people who I would have been compatible with and at times it did get a bit hard to remind myself of the ""grass is greener"" saying. I remember when my wife first decided that she didn't want to be a physical therapist and wanted to switch her degree to an easy one. At the time we were hanging out a lot with a friend who was studying to be a doctor (and now is) and always buckling down and getting shit done. At that time it was pretty hard not to think, ""Wow, imagine being with someone like her instead who doesn't give up and can actually pass ""Intro to Algebra"" Or when I would make friends at the University gym who would flirt with me and while I would of course deny their advances would obviously make me think, ""wow, a Computer Science major AND she likes to workout and looks good? Wonder how that would be?""   
You will run into a lot of these moments, and there is a good chance that these relationships would provide a lot of experiences worth remembering in life.   


Of course the sex stuff as well, we were young. We didn't realize we were incompatible, now we work through it and everything is much better but those first couple years together were rough.   


All in all, everything is going great for us now. But the challenges to getting committed young are present so I do think you should keep those in mind."
