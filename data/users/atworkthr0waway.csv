JusticeServed,ffzas5u,t1_ffz9kau,1580369984.0,"I’m sure that guy felt “protected” in the thought that the bouncer will not do anything, if not violently provoked. Which in fairness he wasn’t, he just got a little touchy, and being a dick by trying to get a laugh. So although the slap seemed excessive, he got enough verbal warning to not get closer. And the body language and stance would already alert most people, drunk or sober, that no shit would be taken that night by the bouncer. So although excessive, it was kinda deserved."
