Futurology,fes7sjr,t1_ferjbo6,1579362265.0,So you are saying it's false that you should match the voltage and amperage and use bricks that have over charge protection instead of some cheap random crap that doesn't?

They are not in the business of selling devices that last. They are in the business of selling. The whole apple store and repairability crap is still ongoing and it doesn't look as though their stance will ever change on that. (Checkout Louis rossman on YouTube if you haven't already). So with that in mind along with their past antics the idea of planned obsolescence continuing still, is far from ridiculous."

techsupportmacgyver,fen9hjf,t1_fen3ggq,1579279884.0,"Yes it is planned obsolescence because why release an update that makes the device unusable? It would be much better to leave it alone on an older version rather than release something that essentially bricks the device so it can be as I have said, still capable of doing the things it could on day of purchase."

>My point in general is that most devices lose official support by 8 years or so. 8 years is more than enough time to get your money's worth, not to mention device lifespan is getting longer these days. I just feel like it's disingenuous to make this sound like a ""just apple"" thing. It's tech, it happens.

The thing is with an apple device it doesn't become unusable because the hardware is obsolete, the hardware is still perfectly fine and perfectly capable of doing the same things it did at the time of purchase, why the heck wouldn't it be? The issue is that Apple devices have planned obsolescence, and they become ***unusable*** *because of* ***updates*** whereas my S4 and a previous commenters nexus device are still perfectly as capable as they were on the day of purchase."

>You also have a Google branded phone. Google branded Android phones get the best support; 3rd party Android phones get shit OS support. I had an S6 before I got an iPhone that skipped 7 and went straight to 8 with no announcement at all. 


Total BS. I still have a fully working Samsung galaxy S4 that runs android 9. I could also update it to android 10 if I wish but I am happy with this ROM so there's currently no need for me to do so.

>And honestly, why would you expect an iPad 2 to work this long. It's grossly outdated.

Because if you spend hundreds of your hard earned cash on a device that was perfectly capable of doing certain things at the time of purchase, there's absolutely no reason for it to not still be capable of doing those certain things just because of time passing.

Futurology,fektkos,t1_fek83ss,1579207319.0,That's true but really you should stick to the manufacturer provided power brick specific to that device or at the very least one within the same specs.

For the gpu you said a 590 or 5700 which is £200-300. So for those 2 parts alone coming in at £500+ we are already near the max of the budget they stated with about £100ish spare for a motherboard, PSU, RAM and storage. How is that helpful advice?"
