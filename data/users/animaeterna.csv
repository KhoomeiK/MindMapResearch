ChoosingBeggars,ffc7l4b,t3_esuk51,1579793375.0,"Given that it was on r/unpopularopinion I’m not surprised. There’s a lot of stuff like that. 
Does make you wonder how free to read outlets support the service though. Targeted ads vs paywalling, what do you reckon would generate more revenue?"
AmItheAsshole,ffbh2uz,t3_espkrv,1579764985.0,"NTA purely because of your past experience. However it may be worth considering your baby may well develop differently. Rather than a potentially unnecessary surgery now, why not leave it and let the kid decide when they’re old enough?"
offmychest,ff9epqk,t3_esegyk,1579711417.0,"Uh... wow. Quick scroll through your post history though and you’re kind of on edge. Go live your own life, just because you’re a committed lesbian you’re actually degrading straight women here because you think your opinion actually counts more. Kind of coming across like an incel here. Maybe r/nicegirls is more your speed."
todayilearned,ff9e2o4,t1_ff9apl5,1579711008.0,"More learning than I thought today lol, thanks mate!"
AmItheAsshole,ff996vd,t3_esdpds,1579707731.0,Your bosses won’t have to provide protective gear because of the nature of your job. Just get a mask off Amazon and crack on mate. NAH
todayilearned,ff95o05,t3_escvqv,1579705431.0,"Very interesting to know that. Plus in of itself, the Big Bang could be fully supported by the church. The idea there was nothing, then boom, universe could actually lend itself to the idea of creationism in its most basic form. Good find OP :)"
AmItheAsshole,ff9593w,t3_escvyj,1579705152.0,"YTA purely because you didn’t even give her the chance to pay. If she’d put them back on the shelf half eaten and booked it, then no mercy, but seriously? I’ve picked up a sandwich and taken it to the counter with half of it in my mouth before lmao. It’s frowned upon but you see mothers with kids in shops open a pack of cake bars or something and give one to their kid to shut them up before paying for the whole thing. What you did was wholly unfair and caused a ton of trauma for obviously a very pregnant woman judging from your post. I honestly do hope your business doesn’t take too much of a hit from the negative reviews but you didn’t even give her the benefit of the doubt. You could have quite easily marched her to the counter to pay but tbh the shoplifting only occurred when you had her removed. Both the product, and her, were fully within your store."
cars,ff8tucx,t1_ff8pwvv,1579695864.0,"Speaking as a van salesman, yeah, buy one lmao. Honestly mate it’s what’s best for you. DM me if you want I love vicariously buying stuff haha. Can go over your requirements and even though I only sell brand new stuff I can point you the right way."
AmItheAsshole,ff8q1tj,t3_esabza,1579691222.0,"I’m going with NAH. If they can’t breathe they can’t breathe, but telling you to basically leave the group because your clothes smell of smoke was a bit of a dick move. 
Alls I can say is maybe show awareness of it next time and wait until it’s all completely finished and you’re leaving before you nip out."
AmItheAsshole,ff8pyak,t1_ff8pta0,1579691080.0,"OP wasn’t smoking, their clothes smelled of smoke. The asthmatic person basically said OP couldn’t have lunch with them because they were a smoker full stop, not because they were smoking at the table."
cars,ff8ptjx,t3_esa2rj,1579690890.0,"Another Brit here- you’ll get murdered on insurance. Pickups are a commercial vehicle and you’ll need van insurance. I’m 28, 4 years no claims and the cheapest quote I had for a mitsi L200 was about £1800- the whole truck was worth 3 grand."
customhearthstone,ff5yjai,t1_ff5ue2w,1579614377.0,"Honestly I’m not really criticising, much better than any ideas I’ve had before, for me I’d probably have it as a battlecry to give a minion reborn. Permanent effect and you’ve still got a strong minion. Very very strong still when you consider you could reborn a Zapp and nuke all their tech cards."
customhearthstone,ff5t1wb,t1_ff5riu6,1579609169.0,Haha that’s even worse man! If it doesn’t get sniped it goes from game breaking OP to just “win the game”
2007scape,ff5ri72,t1_ff4dzji,1579607406.0,Leeds? Mate I’m fucking going. Now. Anybody else fancy skipping on work and getting shithoused?
customhearthstone,ff5rdia,t3_erti4p,1579607251.0,"That. Is. Brooooookkkkeeeeennnn. 
Man I can’t even. Maybe just have this minion with the reborn keyword? That’s ridiculously OP. Imagine that with mechs and Kangor."
offmychest,ff5p0fd,t3_ersxmn,1579604060.0,"Sounds more bi-curious but maybe that’s the conservative upbringing holding you back. 
Don’t know how your boyfriend would take it but maybe honesty’s the best policy here? At least if you’re honest about how you’re feeling there’s no secrets between you :) seriously though good luck OP, hope you find your answer x"
hearthstone,ff3yrwu,t3_eriznm,1579551799.0,"Man you’re the reason you can only emote in game. 
Let people do their thing, and see if you can climb higher."
AmItheAsshole,ff3uqbo,t3_eriayb,1579549272.0,"NAH. If you had plans, you had plans. Nobody’s at fault, and it’s better you got at least a little use out of them"
customhearthstone,ff3uf2i,t1_ff3r74u,1579549078.0,"Exactly! It’s not an idea that’s meant to be game breaking, just maybe even a class feature. Like Shamans have Overload exclusively, druids are the only class with ramp etc. 
It was just a lightbulb moment when I was at my desk earlier. 
At the very least it’s encouraged a little bit of debate, so thank you for commenting!
And happy cake day!"
offmychest,ff3u58w,t1_ff3jo9i,1579548908.0,"You ARE important enough. To somebody, you’re everything. 
Feel better OP. And have a great day."
AmItheAsshole,ff3k3um,t3_ergh0m,1579542743.0,"NTA mate, two ways of handling it. Either outright confront him and go WTF on him, or tell your own lie and say you had a call about it so you went down and saw the footage, then rip his head off. There’s literally no way to be nice boss about this because he’ll fake the piss if he thinks he can get away with it. Short, sharp shock, tell him he can either get a disciplinary or he can pay to repair the damage. Either way, it’ll never happen again that way. EDIT- third way. Give him one more chance to tell the truth. Point out the cracks in his story and if he lies to your face again, deal out whatever punishment you feel is best. Do you really want a pathological liar handling a 40 ton killing machine worth five times his salary?

Also INFO- do your trucks have cameras? In the UK at least more and more companies are putting 360 cameras on their heavies to help with insurance claims over this kind of stuff."
offmychest,ff3jevt,t3_ergi2b,1579542318.0,"Jesus fuck I had to stalk your profile and make sure you weren’t my girlfriend. Same deal today. 

I honestly hope you feel better soon, just know there’s somebody out there who loves you and honestly don’t be afraid to seek help. 
You’ll be fine, you’ll always be fine, but let the people who care about you in. 
Sometimes it’s easier to accept help from a place you would normally expect. If you need to, drop me a message. 

Take care OP"
customhearthstone,ff3f6kn,t1_ff38ar4,1579539820.0,"Not really, most magnetic minions come with other effects like Divine Shield or Taunt. It’s more the idea of a mild buff and adding the Demon keyword. 
Dont think it’s stupidly unbalanced because in a demon centred warlock deck you won’t play a lot of cards that are other tribes/tribeless and the idea is demons can’t possess other demons. Just a little mini mechanic :)"
customhearthstone,ff2y7wi,t1_ff2xmhq,1579528417.0,"Vanilla as in like 3 mana 2/2 with keyword and no other effects.
It wouldn’t be game breaking strong but it would open the game up for class-specific keywords in the same way that only Shaman has Overload."
tattoos,ff2u3ch,t3_ercdr1,1579524211.0,"Glad I caught this before the mods take it down, hope you feel better soon mate, those reactions are the worst."
AmItheAsshole,ff2txa4,t1_ff2t1sj,1579524016.0,Let’s keep it civil mate. Sounds like the kid is over the edge and they’re obviously not trying to be racist. Fetishising skin colour is a whole other level of fucked up but there’s a whole other discussion.
AmItheAsshole,ff2tppo,t3_ercgk2,1579523764.0,"I was on the edge but ESH. 
They’re horrible people for making racist remarks but what you’re suggesting is just as bad. It’s infantile and would be incredibly damaging to you in the long run. 

Take the high road mate, don’t stoop down to their level. It only serves to keep the cycle of hate moving."
AmItheAsshole,ff0i85y,t3_er2hrr,1579469140.0,"YTA bro. 4 piece nuggets is a damn snack. Above all, your neurosis is yours. YOURS. You have absolutely no right to impose your standards on anybody else, least of all over leftovers."
OnePiece,fetq6eq,t1_fetpemo,1579378282.0,"There wouldn’t be any point in introducing Kidd back in unless he was going to play a part. 
I just hope Law doesn’t bite it tbh. Easily my favourite character in One Piece. That and I just had a Heart Pirates emblem tattooed on, be a shame to have them disappear now."
OnePiece,fetnq4d,t3_eqla1c,1579377314.0,"Not sure if the Ope Ope No Mi can actually work that way, but Law will be absolutely instrumental. Only way to kill Kaido given the fact he’s been “executed” so many times will be the Mes technique. Same way Monet died. Heart out, give it the old stabby stabby. Absolutely agree that somebody will probably end up biting it against the Beast Pirates though. 
Again, just opinions with no actual backing, but the idea that the Ope Ope No Mi could forcibly extract the life from somebody is next level OP."
runescape,fet4p61,t3_eqk0ek,1579371786.0,"Upvote for attention, hope you get some success bro"
aww,fesz0ap,t3_eqjpny,1579370325.0,"Yeah but what do they hate more, cucumbers or breaking the “if i fits, i sits” rule?"
AmItheAsshole,fesugn5,t3_eqjcto,1579369115.0,"NAH, but if you’re serious about the relationship I’d highly recommend discussing it. I live in the UK where we have strict gun laws but I still enjoy Clay Pigeon (basically frisbees) shooting with shotguns as a sport. If he enjoys popping the things off but doesn’t support them being used on other people surely that’s close enough?
Guns aren’t solely a means of killing other people. Target shooting is an Olympic sport, along with archery. Both you could argue classify as ways for humans to kill each other, but still are both sports enjoyed for their technical challenges. It’s not worth binning a relationship because you hate guns as objects, without considering your partner’s ethical stance."
offmychest,feq5bn1,t3_eq84d7,1579337827.0,"That’s brilliant OP 😂
Hopefully he finds the workout for him before the ice cream starts working against him!"
OnePiece,fe0pepw,t3_ena3qh,1578817136.0,"Love it bro. I’ve got the heart pirates flag on my right forearm, we can be buddies lmao"
speedrun,fddwhy1,t1_fddw6x6,1578325685.0,"All good man, I’ve not played Doom since I was a kid but speedrunning is all so far beyond me I can’t even take it haha. 
Just love seeing what people are doing with the games from when I was a kid. Keep it up and good luck with the giveaway!"
speedrun,fddvxki,t3_ekvl3k,1578325296.0,"Damn man, so close! 
Keep up the grind, even getting close on your first major go in to speedrunning is great!"
atheism,fd4jepi,t3_ejxwmz,1578168039.0,"Far be it from me to call bullshit, but I’m pretty sure saying they’ve donated thousands in humanitarian aid earlier in the article denotes they’re doing both? 
Sure, this sub is all fuck religion, but since they’re pretty hard in to thoughts and prayers and all the other cuddly bullshit, that’s kind of an expected response. But they HAVE donated and are providing an avenue for their members to donate too, at least if that article is to be believed."
customhearthstone,fd4i6kw,t3_ejtkbv,1578167715.0,"Looks good but playing with the keywords is clunky. 
Maybe battlecry: Adapt and take the text from [[Immortal Prelate]] ?"
OnePiece,fbl4u8j,t3_edqkhz,1576958469.0,Thanks OP! Love it! New wallpaper right there!
