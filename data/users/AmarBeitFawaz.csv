Anticonsumption,fferuop,t3_et2a5s,1579862470.0,"I have struggled with depression for years. One of the hardest things to do is eat. It's easy to eat fast food, since you don't have to cook it. Fast food also tends to be delicious, filling, and faster to obtain than to spend hours cooking and cleaning. Not to mention, the food itself can be a bit addictive. This is not a feasible long term solution, because for many, they don't have the money to sustain this eating pattern. Even if they did, it isn't healthy. But when you have depression, you don't care. You don't have the energy to care. I love Chinese takeout just as much as the next person, but I feel like on some level, this is exploitative of those with depression or another mental illness, who struggle to take care of themselves."
