If two guys cornered a woman and only one raped her while the other kept watch outside is the 2nd man guilty of only standing around? Of course not. He may have never touched the woman, but he still did some heinous shit and facilitated it. The amount of people here defending willful accomplices is fucking ridiculous."

The people saying these things will make themselves out to be the victim and large groups they meet online will agree with it.
