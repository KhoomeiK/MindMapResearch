AskAnAmerican,ffzltw6,t3_evvn7d,1580385209.0,"The day was 9 March 2006, and I wrote a letter.  It’s been edited for length and PII.  Lastly, please excuse my florid prose of 14 years ago.

> […] The restaurant was unsurprisingly full, and our wait was certainly acceptable for both the hour & volume of customers present.  I bring your attention to this fact because I understand that some consolations must be made during peak times, but that the concessions we tolerated during our visit were far beyond what should have been necessary.

> We were seated in an appropriate and expected amount of time, and our server, [REDACTED], soon came to tend to us.  Upon placing our drink orders, our first bout of poor experiences began with our server who found it necessary to make inappropriate jokes with me and my friends, and was unabashed when we asked her to please not.  Because we are aware that cooking and serving take an appropriately longer amount of time when the restaurant is busy, we spent little time deciding what to order and placing said order.  When returning with our drinks and preparing to take our orders, our server continues to make comments and jokes that we did not appreciate.  We placed our orders, and thus the waiting began.

> Overall, the wait for our food was over 50 minutes.  I markedly point out that during our 50+ minute wait: our server never asked how we were, never reassured us our meals were coming, failed to bring our appetizers before the entrees, and was remarkably well skilled at not noticing our attempts to corral her.  In contrast, she was able to twice sit and chat with the patrons at a table adjacent to ours for several minutes each time, and was more than capable of standing and chatting with the patrons sitting behind me for several minutes while we continued to wait for our meals.

> The next time we spoke with our server was (I point out again) 50 minutes after she initially left with our orders; […] We were quite surprised when, only a few minutes later she returned with all of our meals (and I reiterate, our appetizers).  Unfortunately, the surprises did not end with her quick return.

> […] A good fifth of my [7 oz.] steak was gristle; and while I found the outside well seasoned as I’ve come to expect, the inside was flavourless and without moisture.  Unwilling to draw out my meal any longer, I declined my friends’ insistence that I have my steak returned and properly cooked to my specifications, and ate the miserable piece of meat.  At which time I found that the mashed potatoes which I had requested as a substitute for the gourds typically served (which I cannot palate) had not been exchanged.

> As [REDACTED] did not return for upwards of 10 to 15 minutes later, I had to wait until then to request the substitution.  A substitution she did not remember me requesting, and which she had to check her pad when I assured her (against her belief) that I had indeed ordered a double-order of mashed potatoes in stead of my vegetables.

> Fortunately, my meal was the only one which was more-than-marginally erred.  As I ordered a large non-refillable beverage, I’m prompted by my friends to tell you that during the initial 50+ minute wait, they received no refills on their drinks; nor did they receive one again until my mashed potatoes were rectified.

> My wife attempted to enlighten her dining by ordering desert when our server deigned to visit a fourth time (over 90 minutes after being seated).  Sadly, we received our bills, paid our bills, and were preparing to leave when my wife had yet to receive her desert.  After four of us left to partake desert at the Cold Stone Creamery next [door], my wife waited several minutes for the server to return so she could remind her about the desert.  The server then returned some time later with the desert in a “to-go” container and my wife brought it with her to the Creamery next-door.

> At this juncture I must point out that our bills had already been paid, and [REDACTED] had already had opportunity to discover the intentionally, embarrassingly, and ridiculously low tips my friends and I had given her (if memory serves, mine was 7¢).  That having been said, when my wife opened her desert after joining us next-door, she found it was unpleasantly smashed or ground into the container, and (while edible) wholly unrecognizable as the slice of cheesecake she had ordered.  I can make conclusions, but I will refrain from stating the obvious assumption."

> Sallin suggested changing it to a turtleneck, using a form of vertical quilting called *trapunto*. The method creates a bas-relief effect to the material by stuffing the outlined areas with soft thread shot via air pressure through a hollow needle. By the time of *The Wrath of Khan*’s production, the machines and needles needed to produce *trapunto* were rare, and Fletcher was only able to find one needle for the wardrobe department. The crew was so worried about losing or breaking the needle that one of the department’s workers took it home with him as a security measure, leading Fletcher to think it had been stolen."

AskReddit,ffc0fa6,t3_esi1iu,1579788335.0,"I began working for [Montgomery Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Ward) in summer 2000.  I was in electronics and appliances, I was commissioned, and it was only my second job.  I had no idea the company was FUBAR.

I went to work like normal on 28 December, and left in the late afternoon or early evening.  I was waiting by my front door, listening to my grandmother watch the local news while waiting for my girlfriend to pick me up.  A pre-advertisement stinger was something like, “a Lexington cornerstone, the city’s first department store, will be closing its doors for good.”  Before learning about my impending job loss a few minutes later, I thought, “Heh, that sounds like Wards.”

Bankruptcy was awesome for a teenager whose pay was coded for commission.  First off, everybody hears “bankruptcy“ and thinks, “everything is super cheap!”  Nope.  Everything actually returns to MSRP immediately upon declaring bankruptcy, so that the company can get as much money out of its assets as it can.  On the other hand, all sales were final.  So all those TVs, DVD players, etc. that I was selling for MSRP on commission could not be returned (we made the news for that, but it was a federal regulation, not our call).  Soon thereafter, all of the “adults” began jumping ship for jobs that weren’t about to vanish, which afforded me all of their sales for my commission.  Lastly, at some point I was given a custom code for the register to allow me to sell literally anything else in the store—at my discretion for value—except for the register itself.  Also on commission.

By the time I was working on the store’s last day, the register was sitting on the floor, and the government bankruptcy representative and I were the only ones working.  He and I were the last ones to walk out of that store for the last time.  When I visited town last summer: the building is long gone, but the parking lot is unchanged save for 18 years of weathering."

I'm planning to engrave a custom design into the face, fill the engraving with something silvery, and then fix it up pretty and offer it to a friend and his wife as a gift (wall-hanging, or somesuch).  I want to keep both halves because I'll use one to experiment on materials and colorings of the filling, and then use the other half for producing the finished product."

I think I get what you're saying with the table saw; I'd considered that on my own, but since nobody else recommended it, and I only have limited experience with the saw, I thought it was a bad idea.

As for a hand saw, I'm willing to put in the labor, but I don't exactly have a good hand for accuracy.  What's to keep me from absolutely butchering this piece of wood with whatever hand saw I get my hands on?"
