edit: this wasn't meant to be snarky. I was genuinely curious as I'm not seeing the connection."
ADHD,ffw958o,t1_ffv627h,1580290425.0,I agree. It would be very easy for me to be mad at my family and teachers for not realizing this when I was a kid. But I'm talking about the late 70s - early to mid 80s. They didn't know nearly what is known now. Probably assumed it was only the super hyper kid that had it.
zerocarb,ffufmpr,t1_ffszre0,1580240942.0,"I've been wanting to try cod liver. I've heard the flavor is much better than beef liver. Of course, I've heard that about chicken liver as well, and I found it to be worse.

The only problem I'm having is that I can't seem to find it locally. Amazon has it but they only have multi packs. I don't want to be stuck with a bunch of cans of the stuff if I don't like it."
zerocarb,ffuejt2,t1_ffsn3mo,1580240299.0,"Where do you get those? I'd be interested to try it at least once to see if I can choke it down, which I can't do with just straight liver."

I have dehydrated regular beef to make pemmican and that was almost too intense (and I love beef)."

MadeMeSmile,ffri76y,t1_ffqimap,1580158495.0,I don't actually believe [this](http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/400654762321-0-1/s-l1000.jpg) but I still cry like a baby every time I read it. I miss my babies. I'm sorry for your loss. <3
MadeMeSmile,ffrhziu,t3_eumexf,1580158383.0,"I have the ashes of all my pets. They will be mixed with my ashes when they are distributed after I die. 

Methods of distribution include scattered by weather balloon, mixed in with dirt to plant a tree, and the rest scattered in the wilderness somewhere."
carnivore,ffrhiiv,t3_eur2sl,1580158135.0,"Grains are the main source of my reflux (among many other things). Not sure why, but when I don't eat them, I am fine. Seems like that is about all you are eating.

Stomach acid causes the sphincter muscle on top of your stomach to close. When you don't have enough acid to keep that muscle constricted, what acid is there leaks out. So, drinking a lot while eating can be an issue (the fluid dilutes the acid which also inhibits proper digestion and therefore nutrient absorption). Don't drink for 20 minutes before and 30 minutes after eating. (Sips to help get the food down are ok.)

I've seen many sources say to consume apple cider vinegar to help increase the acid, but I haven't had that work."

I would suggest a couple of things. First, think about getting some counseling. It will give you an outlet to vent your feelings and just someone to talk to.

Also, see if there are any clubs in your area for hobbies/activities you enjoy (eg hiking, local sports, gardening, underwater basket weaving, etc). It'll give your brain something constructive to think about and will be a good way to make new friends.

It'll take time, but you'll get passed this."
AskReddit,ffr08f5,t1_ffqqx2v,1580147598.0,Could be slightly worse. There is a bot that will uwu-ize any comment. I forget what is called (which is probably a good thing).

Out of all of those, my aunt apparently has a house with her name on it. Neither myself nor my mom (her legal and medical POA and soon to be guardian) know anything about this. It's in a very bad area of town and not worth much, but still a bit of a head-scratcher."
funny,ffju8vc,t3_etvjsg,1580007094.0,I feel so guilty for laughing at that.
