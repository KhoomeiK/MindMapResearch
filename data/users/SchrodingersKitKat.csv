worldnews,fdef4us,t1_fde0i13,1578337667.0,"This is a pretty dangerous line of thinking. It implies several things:

1. A vote in a democracy is no longer free because it comes with the potential consequence of “if you vote for this candidate and a war is started you must fight.” This could be and almost certainly would be exploited in future elections

2. It punishes people that may have supported a candidate and changed their minds later and visa versa

3. People who don’t want to join the military will lie about who they support. Which could also very easily be exploited in future elections and polls


4. If you fundamentally disagree with a group of people, you probably wouldn’t want them to be the sole people in control of military. The military needs a balance of both sides, otherwise when presidents change you run the risk of the current folks leaving. This would have a big impact on the strength of the military which regardless of your views on war is required for a country to protect itself 

5. It could lead to a civil war over time as new generations get fed up with thinking to themselves “it’s bullshit that I have to fight and they don’t all because I ticked the wrong box 3 to 7 years ago ” ultimately dividing the nation into people that have fought and likely lost a lot of their friends and family etc and the people they’ll probably blame it on.

6. Politicians would likely stop running on changes to improve the country and instead run on how if you vote for them you won’t have to go to war.

Try this:

1. Detect edges (canny, sobel, etc)
2. Find external contours (I believe opencv has a built on function for this)
3. Filter the contours by circularity. circularity = contour_area/convex_hull_area. 
4. Count all the countours above your circularity threshold


Notes:
- you’ll probably want to perform some morphological closing (dilate then erode) on the edges to get a clean separation

- edges alone likely won’t be enough given the overlaps, you may need to weight larger outliers differently (Eg blobs that are > 1.5x the mean blob size get counted as 2 etc)"
