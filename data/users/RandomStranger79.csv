Filmmakers,ff7iqfy,t1_ff7hilb,1579650495.0,"One school of thought is that it's always better to ask for forgiveness than permission. The other is that it really sucks if you get busted and get your equipment or footage taken away. So depending on how high profile the location is, and how likely or not that you can blend in and not bring too much attention to yourself, it may be worth asking permission. (Like the laundry mat, for example. If you get turned down from one or two, then maybe try to guerrilla the third and see what happens.) And try to avoid logos whenever possible, and don't film bystanders if you can avoid it."

Filmmakers,ff7gy6w,t3_es2rs4,1579649304.0,"Short or feature? Monetized or not monetized? Big festivals or local festivals? The answer to all of this is talk to a lawyer but from one indie guy to another what you're looking to do is minimize the likelihood that you're going to get sued or asked to edit your film.

I shot my feature about 25 locations while running stereo Portland. No budget. We got permission for about half. We got locked out of 2 (post office and barnes and nobles, lol.) The movie was picked up by a few decent festivals but none of the big ones. We got a small distribution deal. Fingers crossed haven't been sued yet but that's what E&O insurance is for."
Screenwriting,ff7gtx8,t3_es2u81,1579649226.0,"First off congrats on the script. You'll need a really strong logline, and I recommend putting together a polished 1-pager outline as well as a 10ish page synopsis, key casting ideas, references to similar movies and their box office returns, and maybe a bit of info about the style of how you plan to film it (anything interesting about the way the camera moves or the color palette? Etc)"
