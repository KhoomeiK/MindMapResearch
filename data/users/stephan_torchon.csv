AnimeSakuga,feet3yi,t1_fedd8se,1579040634.0,"I would also recommand to draw movement from observation, it really helps understanding the mecanism and "" break "" your drawing automatisms, don't worry if it looks extremely rough  and sketchy, the purpose is not to have a pretty illustration but locking the dynamics of a body doing weird stuff,sometimes just a few lines are just enough to get that, just look at People doing extreme poses ( dancing, fighting, running...)  and try to lock a pose, pro tips: you can use blinking to lock a pose in your memory more easily, it kinda turn your eye into a camera shutter

You can use vidéo footage, but i recommand live stuff as you can move around and get better angles, personnally with a group of friends we used to check on some breakdancing peeps for that exercice, they do and redo their poses endlessly so if you missed something you can have another chance and they provide some cool extreme poses, also they usually are quite a cool community to do stuff with"

witcher,fdcblr8,t1_fdan4xd,1578271037.0,"For People who know nothing of the witcher, this casting is actually quite relevant and coins some of the theme, like you said, at first glance he Def looks like your everyday tv tyrant, watchers are not used to this kinda choice for an actual guy that is not that bad, the guy looks rough, eats like a pig, yell like an entitled bitch, he looked like a huge redflag, yet while he is morally ambiguous, he shows a lot of sincerity and affection, stuff we couldn't assume he had in the first place 

This really works in the witcher universe, that ep teaches you that it's gonna be pretty grey ride on the moral spectrum, and that evil looking People is not really a thing there
