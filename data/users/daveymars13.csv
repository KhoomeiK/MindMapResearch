Maybe, but there is a genuine, naive, but honest type of tone, in how our friend is phrasing things. He has some fairly simple expectations and understandings of issues that seem to folk who are more jaded to be overly dramatic.  

To me they seem idealistic, and yes, a bit uncompromising--but that isn't bad. It is just markedly different from most folk. That's ok. 

Our friend seems to take people very literally at face value of what they literally  tell him. 

He plays by different rules in that despite the fact that this guy has clearly behaved  in ways that tell us that he isn't into our friend,  he is still wanting to be released from his obligation to the guy he dated... 

I would probably be good friends with this guy if we met/meet each other...  he's a good person..."
askgaybros,ffnco7e,t1_ffha7wt,1580064330.0,Uh... honesty  is not saying  you want a monogamous relationship  and then being all hook up dude.... honesty isn't  having 2 dates then ghosting... it's fine to ghost... but its honest to say... I  am  not interested  in seeing  you  again.    So yeah... he's got problems with honesty.    Is he a full on lying rat bastard?  No... but honesty isn't  a  strength  this guy has.

I didn't think I needed my meds either... but I  did... and fortunately for me, I only needed the zoloft for about 3 years...ymmv greatly...  but...  


I know you are home now...  so you are getting some counseling support for  you now right? 

My boss always knows when there is a problem with my husband,  I  become a bit absent minded... and grumpy... which is not usually me.

My point is...  you clearly care deeply for your man... taking care to remain healthy and sane will help him to help himself..."

askgaybros,ffhas0t,t3_etlo4q,1579928178.0,"Sometimes the best thing we can do is sound the alarm. If a house is on fire, your efforts with a garden hose are not going do what you want.  Similarly  you as an untrained but clearly loving future spouse... must raise the alarm that things aren't good and you are afraid of what will happen when you leave.


1. If his family isn't terribly toxic, they need to know how miserable he is and how worried you are.  Let them know that because you cant be there youbare worried he may  hurt himself in some way. He may need in patient treatment.  He definitely deserves therapy... if you and his family  can present a lovingly United front on helping him to get into some type of counseling is critical. 

2.  Make sure you are available electronically to him as much as you can... remind him every day  about how much he helped you in your life and how you don't know for sure how to return that amazing support, but dammit, you are going to try! (I can tell you want to!!!! You aren't sure how to... that's ok... see #3)

3. When you return home, you need to have some counseling of your own... the more anxious and powerless you feel, the more likely YOU are to relapse in your self harming/non sober behavior...  
If you want to support him, put a life line on yourself so you can remain safe and strong for both of you--functional relationships allow folk to exchange roles and take turns....  the counseling is to keep you strong, and to guide you to maintaining some boundaries,  while still being supportive! 

4. Remember you don't have to support him exactly the way he did for you--you goal is to find what makes him feel supported, and do as much of that as you can.


5.  Don't forget to share good things that are happening  for you in school and remember to actively remind him of how he helped you to be where you are today!

6. If family isn't enough... check into friends of his and any others you can trust to lift him and support him in your absence!  

7. Make sure he reads your post to us... it speaks encyclopedic volumes of your love, adoration, respect and absolute devotion  to this man... you are both so fortunate to have each other!!!

8. You are not responsible for his feelings... (when you were a mess was that his fault???  No!)  Same works for you! 

9. Remember that you are his partner, and He is yours... don't overly shield him from things... imagine for a moment that the two of you are on a hike in the woods together and he falls and injures his leg...and  needs your help to make it out for treatment? Do you call 911  for pro help? Yup! Do you splint his leg and maybe support him by his shoulder as he leans on you... yup... if you helped get the pros and they help him... didn't you help to by shouting encouragement or holding his hand and reassuring him!?! Yup!  Did it help you when he tried to hobble out while leaning on you?  Yup!

Don't give in or give up! You can do this!!!!

I have a guy like you... and I (having a mental health degree--not licensed--so don't diagnose or treat) do a lot of the 'pulling,' like he had to for you...My guy,  he is the kindest, most living and forgiving creature on the planet... when he hurts, I die inside... we've been married for 20 years now...  and the idea of hurting him would break my heart... make sure he knows how deeply his well being effects you!!! 

Love each other! Deeply, emotionally, physically, and often!

Good luck!!!! I AM PULLING FOR YOU!  

(IF a private question or two would help... I am open to that--fair warning-- I am an old guy at 51... and I am hopelessly devoted to my now  lawfully wedded spouse who I married in a church, long before there was a marriage rights movement!)"

Key to making this academically painless if it need occurs, is making sure you keep copies of...

1. Your course catalog/program plan... (it will have course descriptions and provide context for the courses you are taking... 

2. Keep copies of all the syllabuses, papers and projects that you do and your grades if possible-- this way you can show exactly what you did in the class, making it easier for a dean at another school to give you equivalent credit for what you did...

Why am I  focusing on such a negative possibility?

Well... for best results you need to start now, and I  tell all college students to do that from day one. 

Now to deal with your situation now...

There is very little need to be nice to people who laugh at you for not knowing where something is  on the first day. A matter-of-fact,  ""Harsh. you all are hard core here, good to know all that shit in the view book about folk being friendly and welcoming is just that."" 

While you keep moving can go a bit to wither give someone a  wakeup call and get an apology... or to know they are truly toxic... which is important  to know... you need to know who you can trust and who you can't .   

If you do your best not to let being anxious overtake you... and insist on being and staying you. Your people and you will find each other!   Stay strong! You got this!"

askgaybros,ff26jqq,t1_fezd8ba,1579495230.0,"Dude... trust me,as a gay guy with a sex drive like a bear in full rut for my 20s and 30s... I've had more cock than you've looked at, thought of looking at . The only guys I know that could maybe compete, are armed forces urologists... (yeah I ve been quite the slut... )  

I am happy  to report that though I was circumcised at birth... I don't have ANY goddammed syndrome. I like my cock... just as it is .  Its served me quite well for over a half century.  I am not ignorant. Nor do I have  some hangup about natural cock. I have never met a man's cock I didn't like, unless it was connected to  some sanctimonious asshole who tries to tell me I should be angry about something that is none of his fucking business.  (That would be my cock, and my contentment with it=None of your business. )    

Now... so we are CLEAR,  YOU get to be angry pissed off and militantly against circumcision? Yup! You do! 

But NOBODY including God him or herself ,should there be one, gets to tell me how I SHOULD. FEEL about anything, ESPECIALLY my dick! 

My point is,  was and always will be that folk on either side of this issue, have the equivalent right to advocate about their own condition... BUT you don't get to try  to tell me or anyone else how to FEElL about their own cock...

My dick. My feelings. Keep your politics, aesthetics and anything else of yours the fuck away from my cock... 

And again,  from my first sexual encounter at 19, thirty years ago, I  like cock... cut uncut, black white, brown and all the wonderful shades in between... long, short, thick thin, average, small, large, huge.... all wonderful! I've been with men who chose to be cut later in life and love it... I have been with guys who restored their foreskin for a decade and love it too! And both of them did the right thing for them! 

The man I  gave up all of my co-curricular cock for has an amazing cock. I  loved it uncut... and I  love it cut... and I loved him enough to be the only person of his many friends and lovers to say these magical words...  ""Dude, it's your dick. I'm gonna love it and you however it is. Everyone else gets to go fuck themselves! Me included!"" 

In a perfect world I think everyone  should have the right to self-determination of their own natural or circumcised status...but we don't live there... and that is how it is...

I am not the one who is denying reality here. 

That's not blissfully unaware. That's not a pathological stance. That's the truth.  That is reality. 

Any implication that I am some sort of traitor on mens health and rights because I believe FERVENTLY in self determination--including determining that I  am ok with my own experience of having a circumcised cock... and that, yes, even though your assumptions  about me make me VERY angry, I really am upset that you are not ok with your experience--and that I would be the first person after you to try to help you to do whatever you want to to feel more comfortable with your own cock... restoration... etc..  I'm down. Re-examining the 
default of circumcision for all... yup I  am there with you... 

But.... your fucked up assertion that I am somehow less than you because I am not enraged about the condition of my own cock... 3 words. 

(And yes, I would say the same thing to folks who advocate that circumcision is right for everyone... ) 

Fuck you, Asshole.

college,feofn9i,t3_eq7eb1,1579299548.0,"Hmmm... ok...  typically what this means is that you qualify for admission into the institution you applied to... but either... 1. You don't meet the direct admission requirement for your program or college... 2. You were out competed for a direct spot in your program... but attrition happens... and if you do well you could maybe get in later...  3. There was some glitch with your application.  

Call the institution's admissions office... be all excited that you got in... and then ask what it means about your business program...

Good luck! Keep us posted!"

Ja, ich alt bin... ok my 30 year old ollege German sucks...  but my point about this is... you're right... a lot of gay men look at sex as a statement of pride and identity.  And if they are happy... that's great for them. I am 51. American and I get it... 

But you feel and think differently, and you are right. 

They are right for them.   

But for you, you don't need to please them or measure up! You ARE your own man. Take your time!

Finally, I posted this in a different  query, which you may have seen... regarding a guy your age who was having trouble getting PREP.... and fearing getting HIV... 

He seems like a nice guy... you should be pen pals... (yes, I  am  that old...) But what I told him... works for you too...

None of this responds to the emotional aspects of navigating the issues you bring up directly...

But indirectly,  how I am here and happily married to the kindest, handsomest,  smartest guy ever was I took responsibility for myself.  

I made mistakes!!!! But they are mine! And though I  am not proud of them... I am not ashamed either...

Your decisions about who you have sex with vs make love to.. or if you choose to live a life where you never have sex... but make love only... (do nothing till you understand the difference!)  Is up to you, to create the life you want for yourself.  

Be strong! Be brave! AND 

Be kind! (Especially to yourself!)

*************************************
If it helps, I am 51 I graduated from high school in 1987. I became sexually active later that year and have practiced consistently safer sex .. from day 1. 

I did 3 things that I believe have kept me negative...

I kept myself in good physical condition (at 19 I was a life guard instructor) and  after accidentally being able to bluff my way through stopping a gay bashing,  I took a quick self defense class, followed by several years of a martial arts program, with a goal of staying safe and protecting friends if needed. 

When you have tools to protect yourself I guess I just seemed confident and haven't had to raise a hand or my voice... to get folks to back off... mostly.  There were a couple who needed restraining... but... don't try that at home!

The second thing is I will not be sexual if I have had alcohol (I don't use other chemicals ever so...) sober sex is safer and consensual... nor if they are tipsy... or worse...

And the most important thing is in doing anything anally.... condoms, condoms condons...  

There are lots of things that are fun and that listerine and purell, soap and water will take care of...  enjoy those things!!

Oh one other thing... when in doubt,  don't.   That doubt is your survival instinct, listen to it... 

I never had unprotected anal  sex until I was 35 and engaged to be married... to the guy I am legally married to now... 

I know... it sounds crazy... but when you see some of the stuff I did when I was not that much older than you... and the pain and death that happened then... you either get scared or get pissed... I  got pissed.  

Be well!"

Ok... listen to all the lyrics...it's a powerful vocal!

I thought that I didn't care... I thought I was love impaired... but baby...

Now... you need to keep being picky... take your time and make sure you know what you want to do. And don't  settle! :)

Just like in the somg...  it may take you a while to warm up to someone... but you will... 

And don't do a damned thing until you do!!

AND

Make sure you are prepared to stay safe and with condoms and stuff... too... don't get caught in a moment and be unprepared,  but don't force something that isn't there just to get it over with! 

Trust me... you have plenty of time. Keep your powder dry, your mind sharp and your heart open...

I don't feel like you've been able to make him feel how important this is... and  that comes from 1 of 3 places...

1.He's an idiot who doesn't understand 

2. It is important to you but you don't know how to explain to him how important it is and what is important about it for you...
