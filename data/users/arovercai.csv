halifax,fetxxs5,t1_fetqsae,1579381145.0,My uncle had that happen.  With root beer.  That entire side of the family swears by root beer as the best.  They practically held a funeral for the damn soda...
funny,fejuk20,t1_fejty9d,1579186180.0,"This is true.  Startled the horse I had been riding for over a year once - she swung her head right into my nose, made it gush blood for a few minutes.  Poor Rosa didn't even know she'd done it, she just wanted to know what the sound was lol"
funny,fejtimy,t1_fejqf75,1579185483.0,"Most people who haven't been around horses/didn't go through a horse phase, don't understand the sheer power they have.  There's also plenty of films showing someone slapping a (well trained and expecting it) horse on the butt and making them burst into a trot or gallop as they've been trained to do, so I expect this is what they were expecting.

That said, every single one of those idiots got what they deserved.  You should never approach an animal you don't know and try and surprise them - no matter what type of animal, or how well trained they all, they all have defensive reflexes, just like humans, but theirs are usually more dangerous."
NoMansSkyTheGame,fejsja1,t3_epaxw2,1579184788.0,"I was hunting a hauler once, only aiming for an A-class, when low and behold, a max-slot S-class landed...

I was less than 2k units short, and had nothing on me to sell.

I cried.

I never saw an S-class again."

Anyone who thinks it's good that you put your life on the line for company property *that is massively insured*, is someone you don't want to work for.  I much prefer my bosses to be telling me that they value me remaining uninjured and alive over any and all company property..."

HumansBeingBros,fdv7ebu,t1_fdsgpa4,1578744200.0,"The article is likely downplaying how close friends they actually were, because the media loves to portray internet friends as 'not real friends'.  There are multiple people I game with that know my address - two even came to my wedding."

aww,fd31jzk,t1_fd2qo6i,1578153839.0,"The chin is always a distinctive marker for the full blood ones.  I'm fairly certain my fluffy boy with a question mark for a dad has some maine coon in him because he has a lot of other breed characteristics (including size, holy fuckballs was not expecting a 20 lb cat), but he definitely does not have the chin."
Cooking,fd29gzw,t1_fd03yzq,1578143780.0,"This. Or maybe talk to a nutritionist (some grocery stores with pharmacies and health food sections have them on staff, free or minimal fee to talk to) who can give more precise advice for putting on healthy weight.

Also keep in mind that you may just...forever be skinny.  My husband's eldest brother is like that - he looks like slenderman, but he eats as much, if not more, than my 200lb LotR-dwarf-lookalike husband."
aww,fcyocz3,t1_fcy54ae,1578083826.0,"Some dogs just know.  Sometimes they are then helpfully trained to know what to do with stressed out people, too.  My friend has one such dog.  She is his service animal, but we joke that she is the service dog for everyone that works with us, because he brought her in during a power outage one time (refrigerated product + no generators = bad time), and that damn dog sniffed out all the younger management-types that were stressing out and just *leaned* against their legs until they gave her pets, took deep breaths, and got back to work with a smile on their faces.  Literally left all the experienced in-charge types alone, only aimed for the stressed out newer ones."
AskReddit,fcyn4fw,t1_fcxd2ze,1578083146.0,"My husband used to see basically this all the time through his livingroom window: guys in suits climbing up the balcony to get into the apartment upstairs.

They were mormons, visiting the upstairs neighbour who was bedridden, and no one else would let them in the door if the homecare worker/a friend of the neighbour wasn't there."
