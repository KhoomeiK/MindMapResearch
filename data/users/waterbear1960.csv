bipolar,ffj9ebk,t3_etqko6,1579993527.0,Very cool drawing and a good way to use that excessive energy.
Anarchism,ffe83ff,t3_esv4fz,1579839261.0,Very true they are trained to manipulate you and have many ways to trap you.
mentalhealth,ffe80ut,t3_et3tcl,1579839202.0,I'm so sorry. Would you like some practical suggestions? There are all kinds of on-line counseling options now. Look for local support groups as many meet after work hours. Weekend intensives might help and chat groups can be good. Self help courses or YouTube videos are an option. Best wishes!
ChronicPain,ffe7atx,t3_et3fqm,1579838620.0,"Hysterical, sharing!"
trashy,ff8we6a,t1_ff8aneg,1579698299.0,My sincere apologies for making an assumption about your situation. TBH that company and the whole economic system sucks. I just hopped to this post from a Facebook page link. I struggle with mental and physical health issues and my late night posts can be excessively harsh. It looked like you were defending the letter. I hope life gets better for you.
trashy,ff896nd,t1_ff86at7,1579669689.0,"Reasonable is also a big word, prone to misuse apparently. Let me guess,  you a reasonably well paid manager focused on superficial image."
Psychiatry,ff5vo9w,t1_fevdjaf,1579611829.0,Awesome questions. There's obviously change over time in how mental health conditions are defined and categorized. TBH the complexity of the brain and human behavior make me wonder if we will ever fully understand what's happening in there! Humility seems to be in order.
mentalhealth,ff5uyxn,t1_ff51c5u,1579611159.0,Great experience with Peer Support groups. Of course they can vary and you have to listen to some heavy stuff. In those groups we can talk about stuff that people without lived experiences just don't get. Many people have told me that I am a great on-line researcher. I would be happy to help you find info about local resources or anything really. I worked professionally as an advocate and a case manager for adults with disabilities for a quarter century until my own physical and mental health became compromised. I admin several Facebook groups.  Wow sounds like I'm marketing myself. In any case if you want further support in any way let me know.
vegetablegardening,ff5u1dg,t1_ff58lja,1579610225.0,"Yes some places around us in SW New Hampshire it's basically brown beach sand with a few inches of organic matter near the surface. Grew up in Pennsylvania where clay mixed with shale is the norm. Rodales, of Organic Gardening fame, has basically said for decades that adding organic matter is the solution to almost all gardening issues. Feed your soil and the worms and smaller critters will do their miracles. We get lots of hay mulch every year for the veggie garden, use leaves for the flowers and wood chips around the trees and shrubs. Homemade compost and a few times a truckload of commercial compost."
ChronicPain,ff5th0m,t3_ers9cz,1579609623.0,Thanks for all you do here. It must be very tiring. There's a lot of manipulation and meanness on social media. Are you looking for help? I'm a mod for several Facebook groups.

vegetablegardening,ff3z96h,t1_ff3xsv4,1579552101.0,"We have very sandy soil and it's much easier than clay to work, especially in the spring. But it does dry out more quickly so I don't want to bother with raised beds. Just keep adding organic matter"
Anarchism,ff3yz81,t1_fdq034f,1579551927.0,They might say that but spy agencies also are known for splitting movements by spreading mistrust.
insomnia,ff3xq8k,t1_fcay9zf,1579551147.0,Yes I do but my insomnia is very complex. But not feeling tired would probably be a hint because it will show up very quickly if you go days and weeks with severe sleep deprivation.
EarthPorn,ff3viyt,t3_erbry2,1579549769.0,Wow! Lovely shot!
newhampshire,ff3uxkh,t3_erg0ku,1579549399.0,"That's the whole point, to make it confusing and suppress young voters. As one Republucan pol let slip ""They vote the wrong way""."
mentalhealth,ff3sbgh,t3_erbb2h,1579547781.0,I go to a Peer run drop in center and go to support groups there. There are non-profit community mental health centers almost everywhere. I have helped others find such resources by Googling.
traumatoolbox,ff1u13y,t3_er3y1d,1579486172.0,You need a better therapist that's experienced in dealing with trauma. Trauma lives in the body and unconscious mind. CBT is not equipped to deal with stuff that deep and intense
socialism,ff1rycx,t1_ff1r5le,1579484851.0,Short term profit focus on profits is the core issue. The health of the planet and the human race in the long term  ... meh
ChronicPain,feohubq,t3_epyqf7,1579300426.0,Sweet. Creativity is a very good distraction and can aid healing in some cases.
Anarchism,fe0cqze,t3_enbm5v,1578810035.0,Awesome! Need some of this on the American side of the pond.
cat,fe0cogq,t3_enhkoe,1578809957.0,Pretty and so alert!
depression,fe0c55o,t1_fe04kuj,1578809383.0,What would we do without our fur babies? We have a rescue cat that rescued us.
insomnia,fe0bx01,t3_enhx7w,1578809152.0,"Sounds delightful. Great eats! I'm listening to the warm wind howl, which is helping melt the crusty snow. Just looked out and, just like last night, the thick clouds are hiding the Moon. Hopefully the deer won't come out again and graze on who knows what in our flower garden. There was a huge Barred owl out there midday! What else is happening your way?"
Ceramics,fdzsrhv,t3_enc5cx,1578794930.0,Very good. I am inspired to do something similar.
antiwork,fdpgjzj,t1_fdo3v11,1578628055.0,"Well despair, addiction, heartbreak, abuse and trauma and other shit happens even among rich folks."
antiwork,fdpgdw1,t1_fdnyaqm,1578627932.0,Law of diminishing returns applies I suppose.
antiwork,fdpg56d,t1_fdnvoew,1578627751.0,There is good research on it. Making sure poor people have enough money for the basics does make them  happier. But after that it doesn't make much of a difference.
antiwork,fdpfqsr,t3_ema90c,1578627458.0,I believe it. Poverty is degrading and stressful. Gosh in my state (New Hampshire) it's still 7.25 an hour and it's against state law to ever raise it higher the feds. And we have a very high OD rate and major affordable housing issues.
