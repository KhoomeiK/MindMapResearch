CFB,fg5qrel,t1_fg5omiu,1580535478.0,"I don't really have full explanations set, I feel like every time I explain it's something different. I think I explain more reasoning with the Graduate, so I'll skip that and talk more about Old Boy.

Old Boy (2003, not the 2013 remake) is a fantastic revenge story, from the opening scene it sets you up with the cinematography expectations and the ideas immediately being set in motion, the title card itself even plays in a main theme. It doesn't try to hide the themes and what you want to look for. I love the fight choreography, the way they frame the scenes make a lot of sense, and everything related to the fighting is actually like human, and not the normal Hollywood superhuman shit. I absolutely love the direction and care the director takes scene by scene, action by action, line by line. I love the practical effects as well, the soundtrack is so interesting to me. There's definitely gonna be some stuff that may weird you out, as you're not used to seeing it, being part of an American audience, so I understand if there's some off-putting stuff. Once again, no movie is truly perfect.

I think that explains well why I give it a 10/10."
CFB,fg5npfr,t1_fg5mx44,1580532639.0,"Ok, I was making sure, but sometimes I feel like I type or say something, but then I read back, and I find I haven't, at all.

I love movies, but I try not to be too snobby about my tastes, but I have been looking more at older and movie classics overall. The Graduate (1967), completely raunchy and hilarious, but stands on its own as a movie beyond the humor amazingly as well, it never really lulls as a movie, love the pacing. 10/10 experience of a movie. I find it hard to have a favorite, but a movie I keep coming back to, is Old Boy (2003), it's a South Korean action-thriller film, and I just find it completely marvelous in the way it's directed, produced, performed, it's hard to say it's perfect, because I don't think a movie is, but it really is damn close and I'd still give it a 10/10, because it's just taken with so much care that the imperfections don't really matter in the grand scheme.
