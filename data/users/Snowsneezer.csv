depression,feigpbe,t3_epbrsv,1579138122.0,"Hey, you made this post didn't you? That's an awesome start right off the bat. And from someone who knows the feeling ""everyone's  lives would be better without me"" all too well  I can tell you that you're not faking it. I would really recommend you talk with someone about this. Ironically enough the times where us humans most need other is the time we choose to isolate ourselves. As for your parents, I feel a stern ""I really need to see a therapist""  gets the point across. But uh hey if you need someone to tell/ask you how your day was feel free to pm me. Human connection is what changes lives."
gay,feidfc9,t3_ep935s,1579135915.0,"They are a lot of shitty people. Straight or gay. It just seems so pronounced in the lgbt+ community because of our small size. Don't listen to the people that say you aren't ""gay"" enough. Being gay is not a personality trait. Being shallow and judgemental are. 

I don't know any gay guys out there but you post is kind of making me glad I haven't so far. But I know this is not the case for everyone. There are so many cool and awesome people that just to happen to be gay. Hell, my closest friend is bi so I know there's a whole world of awesome lgbt+ people out there."
gay,feibkbk,t3_epa1o2,1579134668.0,"I know the feeling of falling for a boy whom with I haven't even had 10 minutes of interaction with all too well. You wanna know what I've learned thus far? You can't get to know someone if you don't even converse with them. I'd honestly move on. If you can't even get to know the guy as a friend, how do you plan to be his boyfriend? I know those feelings of infatuation are intense, but your mental energy is best spend elsewhere."
gay,feia5wr,t3_epafxj,1579133732.0,"Maybe you should show him the bit about you repeatedly watching him come home at 4 in the morning and then crying about it in the shower because if *that* isn't an indicator that he needs help, I don't know what is. 

It's definitely a tough situation. And there's a lot of things that could go wrong, but the one thing I'm sure of is that you make him feel safe. Show that you're there for him. He's already opened up to you about his drug problems and I bet that was big for him. It must've taken a lot to be that vulnerable with someone.  This sounds like runs quite deep and I really think he needs some professional mental health help. I hope that seeing that he has someone else with him will jog something within him to change. Best of luck."
depression,fei6stn,t1_fei5231,1579131557.0,"Haha that brings me back to the good old days, being picked last in sports games. 

But ask yourself, why is that other person ""better""? Are they smarter, are they funnier, what is it about them that's ""better""? We're all just humans at the end of they day. With time and practice, we can build the skillsets we most admire from other people within ourselves. 

I know that doesn't answer the main sentiment but I really feel like we have to acknowledge our worth. To recognize unfulfilling relationships, walk away, and forge better ones."
penpals,fei4jmv,t3_ep7ovu,1579130123.0,"Dude, you actually made a fucking graph? I don't know whether to be impressed, disgusted, or a combination of two. Regardless, you seem like someone who does some interesting stuff."
depression,fei3kwk,t3_ep842q,1579129516.0,"I'm sorry to say but the most important person everyone should have in mind is themselves. But I get how you feel to some extent. There's this person whom I desperately want to cling onto. But I've come to realize the extent that that will never happen, not because they wouldn't want to, but because life demands so much from us all. I've also come to realize the support that I need is too much for one person to bear. No one person can handle the baggage of another. I don't want to become dependent on one person for my happiness because that is an incredibly toxic relationship not matter how you slice it. 

That being said I get how lonely and sad it is to not have those pillars in one's life. The outside world is incredibly murky and it can be so terrifying reaching out to the humans that inhabit that world.  But it's also one of the greatest joys in life. I truly hope you're provided with the opportunity to make those bonds. And if you can't find anyone in the real world, I would highly recommend a penpal account. Do you know the joy of opening up your email and seeing multiple messages calling your name? It's not quite the same but it kicks the notion that one can't make bonds at all right out the window."
introvert,fdxugqr,t3_en79q8,1578773041.0,"Totally dude. I've even noticed that when I'm engaged with my classmates, I actually enjoy and blow through learning. It makes it so much easier and gives me a motivator to actually do the work even if it's only to talk to them about the work"
depression,fdohgo3,t1_fdm10zf,1578605228.0,">t cognitive behavioral therapy to help most people

Hey, even at my worst there were some situations that were just too damn funny not to laugh at. 

The other day in my math class, this kid wore a hooters hoodie to class. This kid had the audacity to go back and forth with the teacher about how he should be able to keep the hoodie on. Everyone was just watching the it all go down. In the end, he had to give up the hoodie, but god damn was the exchange priceless. 

Ironically enough I've found that I don't spend enough time with my thoughts. But that's because I found what I've been missing. Have you had someone you could tell these minute, insignificant moments of life with? I feel those moments are most fondly looked back on with someone laughing right beside you. If you need someone to talk about the thoughts that keep you awake at night (or the thoughts that make you laugh) feel free to pm me"
depression,fdofcj5,t1_fdmyg1h,1578604033.0,"I don't either. 

But I know I can't keep living like this. 

If you'd like to talk, feel free to pm me."
depression,fdlpira,t1_fdle4h0,1578529414.0,Take the time to reflect and understand yourself. You're self aware enough to know there's a problem. That's a good start. Why don't you indulge yourself in those 10 year old desires? It's a good a place as any and maybe you can branch off from there.
depression,fdlomkb,t3_elycos,1578528803.0,"I completely understand. I've spent the first half of my life isolated. I was so scared to do anything more but go about my day, fading into background. And now I look back and it hurts so bad at the things I wish I could've done, at the memories, friends, and experiences I could've made. I look back and realize there was never anything to be afraid of in the first place. 

I can't know what you're going through right now but I do know what it means to long for the past. I found a quote the other day and it's resonated with me ever since. 

""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is now.""

 Life moves on. Don't waste today wishing for a better yesterday because one day, you'll look back on today and wish you had lived. 

You know what's helped me tremendously? Thinking about the past and writing about it. Crying about the time that I've lost, allowing myself to grieve, but only for so long. Only for a limited amount of time. Set a timer and allow yourself that time to be sad, but once that timer is up, focus on the present and take the steps to a better tomorrow 

I hope to one day come to terms with my past and look forward to tomorrow. I hope you can too."
socialskills,fdll0el,t3_ely5fk,1578526399.0,"I've found that just talking to people makes the shyness melt away (Mind blowing advice right?)

It's about being confident enough to just be yourself. (Another great piece of wisdom right?)

Dude just laugh at the regular shit you laugh at. You got a favorite show? Ask someone if they like it too and before you know it you'll be talking about that one scene where the main character falls down the stairs and then the dog starts humping him.

You get a random thought based on the conversation around you? Speak it. Maybe they laugh along with you, maybe they don't and that's okay. You never know how someone is going to react but that's half the fun of meeting new people.

Friendships takes time and i that's okay but put yourself in a position to be able to forge those bonds. One day, before you know it, you're suddenly friends."
selfimprovement,fdlj3sj,t3_elocsz,1578525142.0,"I like the way you're phrasing your words. I feel them reflective of my own. I love the complexity of this world. Nothing is simply as it seems and its a fun challenge to try and uncover the layers. To go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole and learn things that  would've never thought existed. To pull on one string and watch what happens. Then another and another and another and watch it all unfold right before your very eyes.  There's an impossible situation? What are the small, insignificant steps you can take to get ever so closer to those goals? The plan is too out there? So what? Life is fucking out there."
selfimprovement,fdli28m,t3_elxaq7,1578524479.0,I've found myself speaking more often because it beats being stuck in your own mind. Screaming the answer but never getting it out there. And you know what I've found? It's not so bad. Some people even laugh along with me. There was nothing to be scared of the whole time.
