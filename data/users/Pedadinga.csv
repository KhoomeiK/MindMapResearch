You will have a college girlfriend, and probably a girlfriend after college when you enter the workforce and meet even more people.  You’re 18.  Give it 20 more years, and then if you still feel this way, start therapy.  But really, just take this opportunity to get ready for “uni” (as you call it.).  And a little secret, women of quality won’t care that much about your height.  Be an awesome guy, be smart, make us laugh, and you can be a little short, or have a Dad Bod.  I was hot, I’m still hot (for my age), so I can say from experience, there are lots of women, who are hot, that put happiness with their partner above all else.  Be yourself, and your mate will find you.  Or not.  And that’s ok too."

aww,felj9pb,t1_fel62yk,1579223512.0,"I have to agree with Uke, here.  And I do believe they can enjoy “dance party time”, but you just need to take it down a notch.  Nothing against your voice, but cats have GREAT HEARING.  There’s a reason people generally get softer and higher pitched when talking to animals-they respond to it.  Maybe just whisper when the kitty is by your face.  And the way you pick up kitty is really bad.  Imagine if someone picked you up by the rib cage.  Hold them close, but support their butts.  Their full weight should be supported by your hand.  So, don’t stop the party, just take it from a 20 to a 2."

It was so fun, we did the Mickey, Stitch, Goofy brekkie, but there’s one in park with Minnie, and DCA has a lovely Princess event.
