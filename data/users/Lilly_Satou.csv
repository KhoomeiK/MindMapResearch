I was a teenager during most of his presidency so I don’t remember much of the opposition against him other than racist BS. What did he do that was so awful?  Was it the drone strikes, etc? Republicans usually have no issue with murdering innocents in the Middle East so I don’t think they would see that as a bad thing."
