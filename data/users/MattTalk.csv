SuicideWatch,fdor9v9,t1_fdomu6a,1578611117.0,I love helping others and it hurts to see someone go this way. You’re welcome
SuicideWatch,fdnfau5,t3_em36ps,1578584579.0,Please... no... it hurts for even us online users to see
SuicideWatch,fdnf84r,t3_em8lpq,1578584533.0,"Please. Don’t. Although we don’t see eye to eye, it hurts personally to think of someone else actually getting rid of their own life. Although honestly I can’t say anything because we have different experiences, but I’m sure life will get better."

SuicideWatch,fdneujh,t3_em8btb,1578584303.0,"Please don’t. I personally fear death, however I don’t know if I fear death more or constant suffering in life. Suicide is a terrible thing and it’s not worth it. You don’t deserve this... :("
SuicideWatch,fdnebmg,t3_em2vj2,1578583981.0,"I’m sorry. I know many people suffer from this... and I’m aware that writing this probs won’t to anything if you are “gone” but to anyone else like me scrolling through this page, don’t do anything wrong to yourself. You don’t deserve it"
