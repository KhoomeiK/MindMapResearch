Our oil industry isn't really owned by Canadians. A large amount of it is controlled by companies like Vanguard, Exxon, etc so we really have very little say over the industry. It sucks because there's no cohesive oversight and market deregulation makes it easier companies to pollute.

We also have a strong manufacturing sector in Ontario and they could do better too.

On an individual level, citizens from both Canada and the US are probably about the same when it comes to our individual carbon footprint. We buy all the same shit, we throw it out the same.

I'm actually pissed off to find out that our local government completely destroyed their recycling program and that like many other municipalities, just send all the trash to other countries so they can deal with it. We suck like that and fully deserve to be criticized for it."

I see it differently personally. I grew up listening to 80s punk rock and dyed my hair odd colours and supported gay people and fought racism and that stuff way before it turned mainstream. Most of these kids being 'original' are just buying into stolen trends by corporate profiteers.

We used to have to use kool aid to make hair dye. Now you can go to any store and get a plethora of hues,

The 80s punk/rap/metal scenes were stolen by the major labels and their friends who have a perpetual history of jacking youth counter-cultures and turning them into mainstream trends. In the 90s, all that stuff was appropriated, recuperated, and destroyed.

Since then, there hasn't really been any kind of true counter-culture because scenes develop organically and since everyone hangs out online instead of in physical spaces, it makes it hard for movements to develop. There's no community that isn't corporate controlled.

Even reddit is corporate and designed to funnel people into subs they like and brute force group think dynamics. None of this stuff is organic. The internet got taken over when they killed napster.

It's funny, when all this stuff happened, we used to joke that we'd have to wear suits to stand out. Kids today are literally wearing the exact same shit I wore in high school except it costs 3 times as much and the quality sucks more.

Here's a Gulf War journalist talking about how him and some other guys got fired for trying to air footage from the Highway of Death incident.

[This one is NSFL](https://youtu.be/Yz9MXytE00A?t=120)

Journalists are supposed to be the 4th Estate. They're supposed to stay the hell away from government or corporate influence because historically, it doesn't give the public the best information. Following the Vietnam War public outrage from seeing footage of napalmed kids, etc the war makers had to find a way to subvert the youth anti war activists.

They figured out how to do that by letting the media corps take over and run defense for them. In return, the government relaxed anti-monopoly laws which allows companies like Disney to buy out anything up for grabs. It's completely anti-competitive but hey, it helps the weapons industry make bank.

Hollywood and the entertainment industry figured out generations ago that white teens are influenced by black people via pop culture trends. Literally, the original hipsters were white kids into Jazz, weed, and booze. It's where the concept of 'cool' comes from.

Here's an essay by Norman Mailer called the White Negro that talks about it.

https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/the-white-negro-fall-1957


Hollywood tells young people that black people are systemically oppressed by right wing bigots and panders to teen's sense of justice by putting out movies that are based on race baiting.

Mel Brooks had a habit of throwing in a lot of black guy dick jokes. The industry loves pushing the stereotype that black guys are all well hung. There's a lot of black guys with self esteem issues because they don't fit the media stereotypes. That kind of racist trope goes back a long way. Look up Mandingo movies. In the 70s, they made these blaxploitation movies about white women and black men. Django Unchained is a take off that stuff.

Here's a bit from Hollywood Shuffle where they parodied this stuff in the 80s.

https://youtu.be/_ASZ6K9cPNk

The bit with Tropic Thunder is just an easy way to make race jokes by claiming it's satire. Don't get me wrong, that movie is funny but the reason they do that stuff is to appeal to the target market of 'anti-racist' teens.

During the great Depression, Americans had a fairly strong socialist movement which led to people going on strike and forming unions to demand better rights and wages.

Along with WW2, the US had a strong working class that were getting paid decently doing factory jobs. It created a healthy middle class where more Americans were economically closer together which led to people having better lifestyles, opportunities, and higher standards of living. 

Because the US was making and exporting stuff and the money was being spread around, it made it a lot better for working class people.

In the 70s, US corporations turned globalist and started sending jobs to places like China who never had labour movements and their government had access to millions of workers.

China is rich now because they make and export all the stuff Americans used to. The US is an importer now as opposed to an exporter. Economically, that sucks. Instead of being the factory, the US is more like a retail factory outlet.

In the 50s to 80s, kids could go get factory jobs straight out of school. You didn't need college, you learned on the job. Without needing a degree, it saves a lot of money, especially if you're making a decent wage.

The loss of factory jobs meant that people had to go to school and get trained for other careers so now you need diplomas. What's crazy is that the US made student loans impossible to default on. That means that students were stuck with debt with interest.

Since more kids were going to school, the schools expanded and started teaching a lot of really useless courses that seem interesting but have no value whatsoever.  US outstanding debt is over like $1.5 trillion. It's all money people can't pay back because their high priced degrees are useless.

Photoshop is awesome in that it's fairly easy to learn to make something moderately decent looking but not everyone has the same abilities.

They lifted that ban to avoid it turning into the Streisand Effect. People wanted to know why they were banning those types of pictures. The military eased up before it turned negative on them. 

Here's the thing. US mainstream media is all corporate nowadays and extremely concentrated under a fairly small group of giant companies. Disney owns ABC & Vice. Time Warner/AT&T owns CNN. Newcorp owns FOX, Viacom owns CBS, Comcast owns NBC.

These companies work together as a shared monopoly or oligopoly.

They work in collusion with the US military at an executive level which is why they fired everyone anti-war after 911.

Here's a wiki article about media coverage during the Gulf War.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_coverage_of_the_Iraq_War

The US military figured out in the 60s that they hated the Journalism industry and teenage youth activists. The Vietnam War anti-war activists were fueled by the raw images coming from the free press.

Between the 80s and 90s, the US military figured out how to keep that from happening again by conspiring with the media cartels to phase out war coverage and control public opinion. 

They take this stuff seriously.

He exposed the connection of the CIA to inner city drug distribution. This is also connected to the Iran Contra scandal where the US was selling weapons illegally to Iran through Israel using drug proceeds from inner city US cities.

This stuff started back in the 60s. The US government hated black activists and filling the hood with drugs was a way to subversively destroy the predominately black demographic. In the 80s, black activists tried to fight this problem. Mainstream media outlets introduced Gangster Rap which subverted 80s activists and undermined them.

The powers that be knows that white youth support black people politically so they subverted black activists in order to suppress white youth from siding with them in tackling all the socio-economic problems that comes with living in high crime, low income communities. Keep black people dumb and easy to manipulate and you can easily convince the majority of white youth to act the same way.

The rise of the prison industry is assisted by toxic media that targets low income youth. Rich people make bank off middle class people paying to lock up poor people.

Meanwhile murder rates in poor communities have stayed high for decades.
