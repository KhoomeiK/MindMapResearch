Oppression of ANY race that need’s to stop !

I am however fed up to my back teeth of hearing about how black people were slaves many, many moon’s ago.
For clarity as i stated “ do NOT agree with slavery “.
What about the white irish people, they were slave’s too, same shitty treatment, same shitty abuse, same shitty condition’s !
But no one talks about that when the talk of slavery come’s up, that bite’s my arse.

There’s still to this day a Modern slavery still happening, it’s not on & all about the colour of one’s skin though, it’s the sex traffickers, the ppl selling ppl, etc etc etc.

Let’s put a stop to ABUSE of any kind to our fellow human being, stop living in the past & look to the future of hopefully, everyone loving & respecting everyone else."
