It doesn't really matter if you use Holland to refer to the country as a whole, but we'll judge you a bit."

AskReddit,fec7h1b,t1_febyb6j,1578967973.0,"I'd argue that whenever you're referring to any group by any characteristic it's implicit that they're human and you don't need to specify that they're people. It's ""football players"", not ""people who play football""; it's ""diners"", not ""people who are dining""; etc. By placing heavy emphasis on the distinctions you deem important enough to apply this logic to, you're reinforcing the idea of fundamental differences and inequality. 

Some language really isn't acceptable, I agree. The reason why some words or phrases aren't okay to use is because they have a history and certain connotations. ""(The) blacks"" is definitely one of those, as is ""disableds"". ""Asians"" and ""Filipinos"" refer to geographic/cultural origin and are quite obviously okay to use.

By creating a narrative where nationality (or another characteristic) reduces people to colour (/sex/gender/sexuality/able-bodiedness/etc.) you're succumbing to some accidental or unconscious racism (or other - isms) yourself, too. ""Race"" =/= nationality =/= physical characteristics =/= cultural constraints."

bestof,fe5vwof,t1_fe5ok71,1578876130.0,"In my eyes organized religion definitely negatively affects the lives of the people who practice it, as well as those around them. I'm a (former) Irish Catholic and that shit wreaks absolute havoc on your mental well-being. I'd like to point to wars present and past, and religious terrorism; sexual, physical and emotional abuse and neglect; those in power in religious hierarchies protecting their members and each other from the consequences of their crimes and covering them up, as well as engaging in nepotism and favoritism; the tendency of religious leaders to hoard money while admonishing others to live soberly, and refusing to turn those assets toward enforcing their supposed religious morals and duties; the sheer, astounding scope of religious hypocrisy in general; and a myriad of other nasty practices. 

Religion is like a virus, spreading through indoctrination and (in some cases at least) slowly destroying its hosts and, by extension, those around them. I find it especially grievous that religious people will forcibly indoctrinate their children, preventing later generations from forming their own opinions and potentially letting religion die a natural death.

Given the disproportionate number of African-Americans you might even argue that that particular chain of slavery is unbroken to this day.

Aside from that, the US and Australia always had more resources and population that Britain. The main reason they were colonised in the first place was the technological superiority of their oppressors, coupled with their brutality and lack of (modern) morals. Those two countries surpassing Britain in terms of economy probably has a lot less to do with immigrants than it does with other factors.
