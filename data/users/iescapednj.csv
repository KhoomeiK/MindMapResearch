Sims4,fezomsb,t3_eqxhu1,1579459731.0,If they are due home from work at 1pm but don't come home you can have them leave early. As long as it is past 1pm it doesn't effect your performance.
AskReddit,feyytcd,t3_eqjrvi,1579452170.0,"The Sims. Been playing since it came out. I am having a good day, happy family, happy life. I am having a bad day, let's see how miserable I can make your life before killing you. Always fun."
IAmA,femvv67,t1_fek2rt1,1579270973.0,Same for me. Always wondered why woman didn't follow through. I followed through and  all I got was grief and more pain. I had state police tell me they hope I can run cause they won't be rushing to my house. Also had a judge say he refuses to ruin a man's life over it and refused to put him in jail. The prosecutor actually stood up in court and read the law to him just to get him to do the bare minimum required by law.
Sims4,fejxygi,t3_epglxy,1579188393.0,Did you unlock an achievement for that? I was pleasantly surprised for getting one for creatively killing 10 (not a once).
cats,feegprv,t1_feeg9t9,1579033404.0,2 of my 5 are part Maine Coon. They love the shower. I personally find it creepy.
cats,feef5sk,t1_fedsh7v,1579032492.0,"Omg do you know how lucky you are? Between the scratching, dramatic meows and the dogs throwing themselves at the door, I am thankful it is still there in case I have company."
cats,fedjmoe,t1_fedhtav,1579013189.0,Are you trained yet to never close the door? Can't tell you how many times I have almost embarrassed myself because it never crosses my mind to close the door anymore.
cats,fedad5a,t3_eokeql,1579005567.0,I have 2 dogs and 5 cats. The only time they all get along is when they all cram themselves in the bathroom with me. I feel your pain!
keto,fe65396,t1_fe62ywf,1578881971.0,Thank you. I needed that. I will look into low carb eating and see if that makes me feel better about my food options. I miss cherries!
keto,fe4y8wu,t1_fe4n2xh,1578863915.0,"Anytime. Life can be rough, reach out whenever you need a boost."
keto,fe4mz03,t1_fe4h7ox,1578860952.0,"Thank you for such a thoughtful reply. I do have autoimmune issues that lead to inflammation and bloating. Like you, I prefer veggies and fruit but before keto wasn't working.  Keto for life will cause me to fail because of fruit and veggies but a traditional diet never worked. I am 48 and no longer want to have to diet and be so freaking aware of everything I eat. I want to just be happy eating, for lack of a better term, responsibly. I am just scared I will once again fail miserably because I wasn't proactive."
ptsd,fe4azx7,t3_enkk4n,1578857422.0,"Try and keep your bed as just a place to sleep (sex obviously if you are in a relationship). I do not eat, relax or just hang out ever in my bed. It is basically for sleep only. I have found rituals that work, laptop tv, podcasts, background noise etc. Added to the fact the bed equals only sleep. If I am sick, I use the couch. Somehow, my body has adapted to knowing when we are in bed it is for one purpose and one purpose only and it surprisingly helps."
keto,fe497de,t3_enqjep,1578856944.0,I suffer from PTSD and have used food as a way to comfort myself and reduce panic attacks. Kudos to you for being so strong and taking the long and hard journey to being mentally and physically strong. You go warrior. Slow and steady is an awesome route to take. Don't ever give up.
ptsd,fe47sy6,t1_fe463mh,1578856549.0,You are a blessing. I thought about going back to school to help people like me but I wasn't sure I would be strong enough to deal without feeling their pain and hurting my own mental health. Thank you for being so strong and helping others like us.
ptsd,fe41r1s,t1_fe40hqd,1578854959.0,"Your story makes me feel better. It is hard when you are struggling and a professional tells you a way of coping isn't ""right"". Thankfully I have been there, done that to know to walk away. As long as you aren't hurting yourself or the people you love, who cares how you make it through the day. Toughest lesson I ever learned."
AmItheAsshole,fe3ufup,t3_enmc78,1578853002.0,"ESH. I can see both sides. Completely and totally understand why you are hurt. On the other hand, just because your husband has an overly fond memory of a concert and the aftermath, it could just be reflecting his age with the experience. It's not that it was a better experience, just the first time at a younger age which can lead to remembering the good at the moment not the whole relationship."
cats,fe3sysb,t3_ennw7w,1578852610.0,"Mine is 16, has cancer and has had 2 strokes since October. She is now a raging asshole because I do whatever she wants when she wants because I love her and want whatever time she has left to be happy and comfy. The other 4 cats, however, think I am an asshole who doesn't like them because she is queen bee. Sad they don't understand that when they are in her position they will get the same treatment."
ptsd,fe3ova8,t3_enpfzn,1578851440.0,"It's been years since my initial trauma which caused me not to be able to sleep. Even now, I am happy if I get 5 hours without waking up. For me, I needed background noise to sleep even though every damn therapist told me it wasn't the solution. I either put a movie on my laptop or have Alexa read me a book. I also, for lack of a better term, scripted a pleasant movie life for me. I turn on laptop or Alexa, close my eyes and script the movie. Because I am so focused my mind doesn't wander and I now fall asleep within 10 minutes versus several hours. Try everything,  even if it seems stupid or too simple."
AmItheAsshole,fe3e6ml,t3_enmjga,1578848446.0,YTA. At 35 you not only know how rough life can be but you even admit you know your mom did her best to do right by you. Why would you say that to her?
ptsd,fe2bcwx,t1_fe2217x,1578836492.0,"I use to work for a dentist. They are expensive, however they are molded to your teeth and are a lot more comfortable to use then the ones you buy in a store."
IAmA,fd4d6ut,t3_ejzdg1,1578166508.0,I tried a hypnotist to stop smoking. They couldn't hypnotize me. He said I had to let go of my control issues. Was he a bad hypnotist or do I have control issues I need to work on?
ptsd,fd3nkcn,t3_ejm4sz,1578160018.0,"I have the opposite issue. I have anxiety trying to fall asleep because I feel to vulnerable sleeping. I am sure my way probably isn't medically sound but I found not worrying if I slept actually helped me sleep. It's been 12 years and I still rarely get more then 5 hours a night, not always in a row but I don't feel like I am dragging nor do I stress over it anymore. If I felt tired, I would set an alarm an use my lunch hour to take a nap or nap for an hour when I would got home from work. Back in the day, there were been times where i have gone almost 24 hours without sleep from stressing over it.  I guess what I am trying to say is stop trying to fit in with every day norms. If you can find ways to get enough sleep without waking up with overwhelming anxiety do it. I had a therapist once tell me I was doing fine as long as I was still getting from point A to point B. It didn't matter if it's the straight line most people take or a long circular route only I took. The point is I still made it there and to cut myself some slack. It will take time. You will have setbacks. I am not saying it's a switch you can flip,  just keep searching, try not to let it suck you under when it doesn't  work and hopefully you will find your route."
glutenfree,fd3c9le,t3_ejpsds,1578156853.0,"I had appendicitis. From the time I woke up feeling sick to surgery was less then 8 hours. I went from testing straight to OR because my appendix was about to burst and possibly kill me. Sometimes it's gluten, sometimes it's something else. If you can afford to go to doc, always go even if you suspect gluten. You only get one life."
AmItheAsshole,fd2ltn4,t1_fd2fbxf,1578149053.0,"When I was a young girl/woman, horror movies were terrifying and would give me nightmares for weeks if I watched one. Now, 12 years after almost being murdered myself, I have yet to see a horror movie that is scary and at some point doesn't make me laugh."
AskReddit,exztwj7,t3_cus446,1566670627.0,All th woman in my family start at a C cup and go up to DD. I am lucky to be called an A cup.
