Any time I‚Äôve been pulled over, I signal immediately, then wait until there is a safe location to pull into or a large shoulder on the freeway. If it‚Äôs at night, I‚Äôll turn on my overhead lights so the officer can clearly see inside the vehicle. Immediately roll down your window, then keep both hands on the wheel as they approach your vehicle. Be respectful. 

All these things help the officer know the situation they are getting into and that they are safe. As long as you‚Äôre not drunk or doing something else incredibly dangerous, the odds of getting a ticket significantly lower."
