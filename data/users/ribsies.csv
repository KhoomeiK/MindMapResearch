It's so they can ask her these types of things alone"

So if you don't want to look suspicious by just beeping 3 numbers, you can put in 7 with any of them being 911"

leagueoflegends,fevnkn5,t1_fesem07,1579399388.0,You really gotta try to lose that much. Especially at that low mmr. You would basically need to run it down mid constantly

Gloomhaven,fep7jt0,t1_feoxgvb,1579313901.0,Nah. It's totally worth it to sleeve the whole game. I would be very annoyed if i always had to sleeve and resleeve stuff based off it's current usage.

boardgames,feczg6b,t1_febikch,1578991108.0,I don't know how common this was but when we were younger we never played the rule that selling your houses sold for half price or whatever. We didn't want to deal with extra math.
AskReddit,fecxksz,t1_fecju7l,1578988697.0,"There was this guy I met when the game first came out. His character name was Garmonbozia. He was one of the first lvl 60's in the game. We were pretty good friends. Then he just disappeared one day.

A few months later he came back online and I started talking to him, turns out his wife met someone from WoW while she was playing the game and divorced him to be with this new guy. They had a couple kids.

It was messed up."
mtgfinance,fe6ucgt,t1_fe6siyg,1578905370.0,"Seriously. The +2 is bad but not nearly as bad as his +1. I have no idea how they could justify that. 

""Hey yeah let's give him a +1 that either gives a 3/3 or counters any creature they play! Next Planeswalker let's give them a -2 that gives them a 1/1 token!""

So consistent"

And no they are not literally LDS members, they are separate religions.

You could argue they are LDS because it's in their name, but that's a silly argument. They are different religions. FLDS members are not members of the LDS church."

pcmasterrace,fdmm722,t1_fdmicpl,1578555265.0,"The thing is though, thats not really competing. Guaranteed theres people with a lower stat than you that are actually better at the game.

Stats can be doctored by a very specific playstyle. It means very little when it comes to overall skill.

So you are only competing with yourself. If you give value to that number, thats fine. But dont think you're competing against real people."

The problem with that is it probably wouldn't be popular, because it's a terrible story."
