exchristian,ff890n0,t3_es4tzt,1579669539.0,"That must be super annoying. 

My grandma is a minister and she's steadily trying to convince me to go to church and even bought me ""church clothes"" . It's funny because I have tattoos and the stuff she got me covers everything."
exchristian,ff88syu,t3_es5jr5,1579669348.0,I was always an atheist until last summer. I was desperate for something. So I gave the whole thing a go and went to church every Sunday and got super involved for like 3 months. Red flags were flying and my logical mind just couldn't stay quiet. So glad I didn't let myself get brainwashed.

AskMen,fehy3et,t1_fehxqv3,1579126181.0,"You'd be surprised how many people you know or have known are autistic. Just because it's not obvious doesn't mean it's not there. Especially in women. Read up, homeboy."
AskMen,fehxgjg,t1_fehthpc,1579125805.0,"Honestly, I don't care about your interactions here. The only thing I care about is the one point I made. You're missing my point. And I'm not even going to waste my time responding to every messed up thing you said."
AskReddit,fehr4rn,t1_fehqy28,1579122217.0,Okay cool. I'll look into it. Thank you!
AskMen,fehr1km,t1_fehg408,1579122167.0,"Want to know something ironic, barwey? 


I asked this question because I wanted perspective, because I'm autistic and see things differently than the majority of people I know. I heard a phrase that I couldn't fully make sense of or determine whether or not it was something ""normal"" people actually care about.

So here you are getting in a lame argument with a stranger on the internet over their opinion. Things aren't going your way so you resort to dropping derogatory bombs on a post that happens to belong to someone who people actually like to call retarded. 

Thanks for that."

AskReddit,fegz1yd,t3_ep4blm,1579105693.0,I'm autistic and finding/keeping a job is hard. I saw someone mention that if you find a boring/repetitive job you'll do good and be irreplaceable in no time.
