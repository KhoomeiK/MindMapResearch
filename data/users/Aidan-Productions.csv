depression,fepligj,t3_eq0um9,1579323649.0,Being alive costs money. I hate that. Imagine someone paying less to do something. And you have to pay more.
depression,fehkdqh,t1_fehfsyc,1579118325.0,"You will find out, it is hard to go through with it. At least live till you are 21 and then rethink life. Go to a therapist. If nothing else works. It is your choice. Understand, school is a depressing place. Then seeing what friends your have get girlfriends, makes one feel hopeless and lonely. Give it a couple years.... even if you do suffer. Everyone on this subreddit will suffer together. It is better then being alone. Regardless, I hope you are doing good. Don’t kick the bucket yet."
depression,fehjt3a,t3_eoxkvp,1579117996.0,I mean thank god we die eventually. At least we are not immortal. That would be horrifying.
depression,fehjnqg,t3_ep4bw6,1579117907.0,"I bet your hoping for comforting irl. Doesn’t happen often. Especially when those who comfort don’t know what someone with depression is going through. Imagine having 20 years of school and 30 years of work. I am still in high school. But it is still depressing to find out, most of my life will be pointless."

You would think it will erupt again because it is way past it’s due date. A super volcano. Could occur in the next second, minute, hour, day, week, month, or year."
Worldbox,fdkxjia,t1_fdkmgst,1578513212.0,Catapults then? That would amazing too. Also over time kingdoms can have different jobs for everyone

Worldbox,fckwm5s,t1_fckohn3,1577734769.0,Yes. True. These features and many more will continue to be added. I hope. I am hoping for something where when a nation can declare war and then take a bit of land and puppet the nation they beat in the war.
Worldbox,fckrvl3,t3_ehq3i3,1577731848.0,"Cause: after suffering from famine and death of hundreds of their people, the orcojuntians marched on Ningen towns, causing retaliation. The arsenals of both nations are prepared for a full blown conventional war. Nuclear war heads..... 



Advantages for the orcojuntians:
1. They have the numbers, the equipment and overall a better chance



Advantages for Ningens:

1. Tactical superiority
2. More resources
3. Multiple different villages
4. Can amass a huge army when ready."
Worldbox,fck7s64,t3_ehjk89,1577718947.0,I think kingdoms should fall into civil wars if they fail to feed the population. It would surely be a spectacle to watch.

Worldbox,fc6q6px,t3_egeh2x,1577486695.0,Imagine a kingdom being able to puppet or make another a client state.  That would be a cool feature if kingdoms could surrender and not get massively slaughtered.
