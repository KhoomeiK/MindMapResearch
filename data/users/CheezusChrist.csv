If she is spayed, I would take the toy and get rid of it when she’s not looking or distracted by something else. If you absolutely can’t get rid of it, then I would let her chew or play with it while you’re holding it so that it’s on your terms not hers."

If I had one wish in life, it would be to have every dog owner go through this protocol start to finish at least once. It will really change the way his brain thinks about how to behave to get what he wants."

Dogtraining,ff92r8u,t3_es9hjj,1579703418.0,"He’s just not ready for that much freedom yet. That’s not to say he can *never* have an open doggy door. Puppies are still like young children. You wouldn’t leave your 8 year old home alone with an open door. For now he needs to be crated or kept in an area where he doesn’t have access to things he’s not supposed to chew. When he’s older and more trustworthy, you can open the doggy door again. My dog had to be crated until she was over a year old because she would chew anything and everything. Even in the crate, she ate a hole in my drywall because the crate was against the wall. Now she gets all the freedom (though she still likes her crate a lot)."

Dogtraining,fekor6c,t3_epnuhp,1579204473.0,"My aussie is the same. She prefers the linoleum over anything else and will not sleep in bed with me unless it’s winter. I put a squishy gel cooling mat in her crate and that’s the only thing I’ve been able to put in there. Other than that, it’s hard to train them
not to like hard surfaces. If it makes a difference, some older dogs get those rough elbows even though they sleep on soft surfaces, it just happens with age."

fatlogic,fe3irzi,t1_fe06ees,1578849636.0,Must have skipped the part about how ventilation is harder under anesthesia. Or how anesthetic drugs are calculated based on lean tissue and metabolize unpredictably in a body with large amount of adipose.
Dogtraining,fe3hglk,t3_enpqba,1578849311.0,"They can be tricky breeds for fetch. My aussie is 10 years old and has never brought the ball back. The best time we had was when she had another aussie buddy who was slower than she was to chase the ball, but would bring the ball back when she dropped it. I usually have at least two balls with me and have basically resigned to the fact that I have to fetch as well."
Dogtraining,fe3fjmq,t3_ennza0,1578848792.0,Aggression at that early of an age is a serious red flag. You will be in for a lifetime of stress. I would return the aggressive one to the breeder.

Dogtraining,fdemxe2,t1_fdekkm8,1578342403.0,"Yeah, keeping track of friends is another perk. My current facility encourages coming on the same day every week, that way they have the same buddies. Easier for the employees and good for the dogs."
Dogtraining,fde7745,t1_fde6qhl,1578332685.0,"Yeah that can be an issue too. That’s why I like the rotation system. That way they go out on a regular basis, usually every 2 hours depending on the facility. I worked in an “all day play” facility and that is the natural rhythm of dogs in those environments even though we didn’t enforce it. They would play for 20-30 mins, nap for 1-2 hours, play for 20-30 mins, nap for 1-2 hours, repeat."
Dogtraining,fde23xo,t3_ektmsu,1578329456.0,"Avoid “all day play” facilities. Dogs *need* to sleep for several hours a day and forcing them to play or be constantly around other dogs can make them grumpy and cause behavioral issues long-term. I like facilities that rotate them out in small, tailored groups (10-15 dogs max), where they get 20-30 mins out, then back inside for a break. They really only need that amount of time before they start to get tired and/or annoyed with the other dogs."

I purl through the back loop when I switch from a knit. It shortens the distance and makes it look a little bit better.

fatlogic,fcv54i3,t3_ej0fld,1577994842.0,My friends just saw Madonna who is 62 and said she was incredible. I guarantee you her shows are more athletically demanding than Lizzo’s. Let’s wait 30 years and see what Lizzo’s doing then if she hasn’t lost any weight...

Dogtraining,fc9n9yx,t3_egticr,1577555251.0,"Agreed with other poster. Picking a puppy to train into a service dog is usually a highly selective process. Puppies that are calm, easily handled, curious, etc, are the ones that get chosen. Your puppy may not be a great candidate for this purpose. However, training can go a long way too. Start with puppy classes and build a good foundation before going on to specialized training. You should also prioritize socialization and exposure to lots of potentially “scary” things. Stay patient as well, you’ve got to get through the crazy adolescence phase first, and after that it may take years to get your dog to where you want training-wise, depending on how hard you work at it."
