Having 15 queens in season 11 didn't help. The bigger the cast, the bigger the risk to not stand out."

However I doubt they will do it with projects Ru is actually an active part of."

rupaulsdragrace,fff1ola,t1_ffeztni,1579873261.0,"They also have to consider Drag Race UK and Drag Race Celebrity.

A month or two between seasons enough time to generate excitement towards the next season!"
rupaulsdragrace,ffexo9f,t3_et7p0t,1579869620.0,"My problem is more with seasons airing back to back without building a momentum.

If they air AS5 one or two weeks after S12 finale, airing the promo in the middle of S12, it'll take away the focus from 12 and not build up properly AS5...

I'll be happy to watch either way but it's better to get the fans salivating and wanting it badly..."

rupaulsdragrace,ff8gsaw,t1_ff8c3q0,1579677802.0,"Ru doesn't go to the Emmys or Met Gala in drag. 

SNL may have a wider audience and I'm sure drag will part of it but it seems complicated organisation wise to do the whole thing in drag."
rupaulsdragrace,ff7bvvh,t1_ff7bu18,1579645895.0,I would love for this but this would feel so off-brand for Ru! But you made me wanna see it so bad!!
europe,ff7ajh2,t1_ff6p8n6,1579644685.0,You should be clearer. ENGLAND and WALES.
rupaulsdragrace,ff79oms,t1_ff79895,1579644002.0,"They may do that. I don't know how easy it is to change outfits when you're padded from ankle to shoulder haha.

Rupaul always appear in and out of drag in both Drag Race and AJ and the queens. Mostly out of drag for anything else so far lately (if I'm not mistaken). 

I feel drag is definitely gonna be involved in some skits, at least the once recorded before. But I also feel Rupaul will want to do this as an actor and not just as a drag queen (not implying drag queen is less than an actor in any way).

But I'm no Rupaul!! Just some light speculation from me. :)"
rupaulsdragrace,ff77j1a,t1_ff772zk,1579642658.0,"I'm not saying they don't!

I'm just saying that Raven beating Rupaul's face must take 30 min minimum, probably more 1+ hour. If they wanted to do skits in drag, either they would have to do the monologue and then quickly ""unmakeup Ru"" or make all the outfits easily changeable without touching the makeup and keep the same beat for the whole night with slight retouche.

I think (and I may be wrong) that Ru will probably go the more manageable way as he's been doing for most events lately.

Either way I'm happy to see Ru!

Edit: but quite easy to have Ru in drag for the pretaped bits."
rupaulsdragrace,ff76y29,t3_es15qe,1579642332.0,"Wow !! I never thought Rupaul would do this! She'll probably do it mostly as a man (too complicated to fit good drag makeup when you need to change every five minutes).

Can't wait!!"
rupaulsdragrace,fema7on,t1_felap6q,1579245639.0,"I've listened to the song quite a few times on Spotify and actually enjoy it much more now than then. Monet, Monique and Naomi have great verses when you listen to it. Really enjoyable. 

I personnel think the standouts of the season were Manila and Monique and I would have been happy with them winning the season. 

However Manila's elimination was within the rules of the game and I see why Monet (best during the finale) and Trin (best track record) ended up top 2..."
rupaulsdragrace,fekffqe,t1_fekcrh3,1579198920.0,Monet was by far the best in the finale episode. Trinity was by far the worst though...

todayilearned,fdqo8bt,t1_fdqnvzv,1578671284.0,"It's not necessarily about colonialism. The French market itself is big enough without the former French speaking colonies. 

The same way the Spanish, German and Italian markets are big enough. Spanish speaking Latin America has different dubbing from Spain. Similarly Quebec has different dubbing from France."
todayilearned,fdqairx,t1_fdq9tzl,1578661198.0,"It's all about habits. When you start watching subbed programs, it takes a while for your brain to be fully capable to scan the subtitles while watching the images.

Most people get discouraged by that since they feel they can't follow the story and the images if they're reading. 

If you add the tendency to do other things while watching TV (cooking, eating, watching your phone, ironing or whatnot), it's hard to follow a program if you are not fluent in the language.

Furthermore, for people who always have watched dubbed movies, they don't realise how poorly done it is. I grew up watching everything dubbed and since am the opposite. I prefer to not watch a program than watch it dubbed. However I remember it's only after getting used to watch everything in its original version that I realised how bad the dubbing was. It never occurred to me before because it was all I knew."
todayilearned,fdq8u2y,t1_fdq6cue,1578659560.0,"The restrictions are on non French speaking programs. An American movie will count as a non French speaking program whether it's dubbed or subbed. However, everything is dubbed (except the occasional obscure movie) on French TV because the market was deemed big enough to justify it (contrary to countries like the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark) and now most French people can't imagine otherwise.

A portion of the younger French generation has a better level in English because of the rise of illegal streaming/downloading subbed programs if you didn't want to wait 6 months to get a dubbed TV show. More and more theatres show movies subbed rather than dubbed but both these phenomenons mostly align with urban middle class/upper middle class people. You will find more movies in Paris subbed than dubbed in the theatres. The opposite in the suburbs and other cities (even though it's slowly evolving in the other cities)."
DragRaceThailand,fdnjc0h,t1_fdniv0b,1578587013.0,"I'm sorry the show didn't help you and the other queens as much as you could have hoped. 

I've been to Thailand a few years ago right when the king died so my going out experience in Bangkok was quite different from usual (went to DJ station and saw a queen do a lipsync of a funeral song for the king and the club closed at midnight).

If I'm coming back to Bangkok, I'll definitely come to your bar and maybe Maggie Cho's in order to see the amazing queens I've see on DRT.

All the love from France. ;)"
dataisbeautiful,fdncakx,t1_fdnaeuz,1578582706.0,"I'm no expert but an extra 100 million (or whatever the actual amount is) of taxpayer money going into the Trump hotels and golf courses (rooms, food and other expenses for Trump, his entourage and the security) will end up into the Trump family who owns the business.

Even if they have to increase spending (extra staff, etc) to cover the increase of activity, that's a lot of money they're profiting of.

If you add the fact that most foreign visitors dealing with the Trump presidency are invited to go to Trump hotels (or choose to in order to please Trump) or even for some cases (Saudi Arabia for example) pay for empty rooms in Trump hotels, that's a lot of money Trump is profiting through the presidency (in this case it's not taxpayer money though).

However, the extra security that has to be paid to secure Mar a Lago and other Trump properties he spends a lot of time at is taxpayer money. 

I'm not American. It's not my money but it's just a great scan from Trump and his family."

rupaulsdragrace,fdmklu8,t1_fdlh006,1578553419.0,But there are not 3 seasons of football already filmed for months...
rupaulsdragrace,fdl7pkh,t1_fdl224e,1578518464.0,"But they will probably air back to back Celebrity, 12 and AS5 with a maximum of one week break between them.

A month or two between seasons with promo gradually released would be so much better for the fans."

rupaulsdragrace,fdkytyz,t1_fdkychm,1578513973.0,"You may be biased on Raven because you love her from FPR. She's an amazing queen with makeup skills that actually influenced drag makeup way beyond drag race. 

She got a redemption in AS1 in terms of likeability because her and Juju together made a very loveable team and then FPR with Raja also cemented her spot in the light. 

However, even though she was good in season 2 (especially after Snatch Game), Tyra really had an edge on her. Raven was more edgy but Tyra really dominated her season."
rupaulsdragrace,fdky512,t1_fdkxobv,1578513563.0,"You should rewatch season 2 then with an open mind. 

First seasons were about how good you are in the competition rather than how marketable you can become. 

Tyra had a few weak weeks but happened to have immunity for them (seems like she didn't try too hard when she didn't have to) and there usually were queens doing even worse (it's a thing that keeps people disagreeing).

However she had very strong runways (even though more classic drag than fashion). She had an attitude but so had the others, especially Raven who was nearly insufferable in season 2.

Raven started quite weak but then shined by the end. Juju was usually good but never on top despite great charisma."
rupaulsdragrace,fdkxq1g,t3_elwhhe,1578513318.0,My friend made me watch AS2 with him while it was airing. I slowly got into it then started all the way from season 1.
rupaulsdragrace,fdkxk63,t1_fdkwrec,1578513223.0,"Because she was much stronger than Raven and Juju. 3 win, zero bottom 2. Raven had 2 win and 2 bottom 2. Juju zero win and 3 bottom 2.

rupaulsdragrace,fdh44q1,t1_fdh3g85,1578414972.0,"One of the differences between Shangie and Adore is that Shangela produced herself and tried to actively paint herself as an underdog whereas Adore let production do it. 

At least I feel like it.

Shangela was asking for help but didn't necessarily help her friends when they asked her. She tried to paint Raja as a bully picking on her even though she was constantly poking Raja with a stick to make her react. It's not a bad thing since it was highly entertaining for the audience.

Bendelacreme or Trixie (don't remember which queen) said that watching Shangela on the set of AS3 was like watching a masterclass in TV self production."
rupaulsdragrace,fdh3156,t3_eldn9b,1578414297.0,"I love Shangela but she was no victim in season 3. She may have been new to drag but she definitely had a natural gift for creating must see TV. She was a production. She was gold. She entertained us. She created drama through and through.

And then she worked her ass off to get where she is."
