violating your dignity

creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment

This means it’s harassment even if the person harassing you didn’t mean to offend or intimidate you, as long as the harassment has one of the above effects.""

From what you've said up to this point, it sounds unlikely the CPS will take up the case as the police haven't furnished them with the evidence (ie. The Witnesses) required to make a successful case of it. That's not to say what I'm stating is fact, there could still be other evidence, and either party could attempt to pursue civil litigation (sueing each other).

Sanchez still has time, Wanyama unfortunately needs to go, but he had spells where he was undroppable.
