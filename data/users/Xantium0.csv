FortniteCompetitive,ffj6utz,t1_ffj6hn6,1579991874.0,Yep. Contacted Epic. They can't help. My graphics card is too weak to work. When the new season drops it should fix again

FortNiteBR,ffhzeb7,t1_ffhu0rs,1579960236.0,"If they use a dedicated physics engine, then yes. We can expect HUGE performance boosts. However, if Epic decide to go fancy by adding extra effects, it could end up doing more harm than good."

FortNiteBR,ffhtf4x,t3_etptb2,1579952984.0,"I mean I'm struggling to play the game as is now. If they increase the hardware requirements even more I'm screwed.

Usually better graphics = more powerful hardware

So I'm downright scared rn"
FortniteCompetitive,ffhs45o,t1_ffhriz1,1579951034.0,Nah more a mobile/switch problem. I have a weak  GPU on my pc so that's why. See for yourself: https://youtu.be/3dFvjeCzaeU

FortNiteBR,ffhpstm,t1_ffhpcg4,1579947442.0,"Not the ones you listed. I tried CS:Go (which I actually sometimes play). I don't get good teammates which puts me off the game a lot. 

Relme Royale (which was fun, but the settings felt difficult to set), ROE (which I didn't like), LOL (hated) and some others that wernt even worth remembering"

FortniteCompetitive,fffsf8c,t1_fffqxxh,1579890787.0,"""biggest clickbaiters""
You obviously don't watch YouTube. Apart from the titles and thumbnails its ok. He doesn't stretch out the time giving you details.  Most channels will make a 10 minute video, out of the first two minutes of Syphers videos.

Also everyone's content has gone down the gutter since Fortnite no longer updates their game. He's trying to stay regularly uploading in a game that has gone stale."
FortNiteBR,ffffnzs,t1_ffffhqk,1579882936.0,"Yes. That's true. They have won several cases in the past,and they often don't bring them back"

FortNiteBR,ffff3ak,t3_etc9cq,1579882578.0,Wait. Thats illegal
FortNiteBR,fffephs,t1_fffe3n0,1579882336.0,But epic won tho. Thirty could bring it back at any time
aww,fffbr5p,t1_fffa588,1579880466.0,Lol someone doesn't like staying inside/outside
FortNiteBR,fff6i4p,t1_fff0eqb,1579876954.0,"Youre fine.

Ik, you made it clear,but unfortunately the servers  don't know that. It thinks you are purposely teaming against the one player"
FortniteCompetitive,fff6bm2,t1_fff0db9,1579876822.0,OK. https://youtu.be/3dFvjeCzaeU
FortniteCompetitive,ffeynuc,t3_et9z1t,1579870586.0,"Have a sub and a like. You seem like a chill dude, you don't clickbait, and you give some good advice. Nice video.  I also like Sypher PK"
FortNiteBR,ffey4wi,t1_ffewyjj,1579870077.0,"Exactly. That's what it should be. If you aren't a problem to the other players in the lobby. It shouldn't be a problem. 

On the contrary,if you are  messing around it often works in reverse. You will have been emoting rather than looting, and it will be an easy two kills for someone, because you don't have the resources they do"
FortNiteBR,ffewlug,t1_ffevp53,1579868529.0,"Yes. So technically it was a 2v1and that was the reason.

I'm sorry, I didn't understand that you meant that from your first comment.

I hope Epic isn't going to go overboard with this. Preventing teaming and hacking is a great benefit of this game,but that doesn't mean you need to start banning people because two opponents (I've had actual teams in the past) start dancing."
FortNiteBR,ffevdha,t1_ffet5eh,1579867161.0,"Yes. Im pretty sure that's not why he was kicked. 

 He was actually teaming and giving himself an advantage by engaging the other player. Had he not engaged I'm sure he wouldn't have been kicked.

I've messed around with other players in the past. Never been kicked"
FortNiteBR,ffev3qi,t3_et8ff9,1579866838.0,"I can understand your concern. I wouldn't worry.

Dancing with an opponent running with them (is technically teaming).    Should not get you banned. I very very highly doubt it in any case. 

You messed up where you got into a fight and didn't split up. Do not both engage together, or one after the other. Just run away/kill yourself. That's teaming that will get you banned in comp (and may  in normal)

Epic wants people to not team so people don't get an unfair advantage. Messing around with an opponent isn't getting an unfair advantage."
FortniteCompetitive,ffeuhrs,t1_ffervoe,1579866088.0,"One of the few bonuses of running an R7 graphics  card. 

NGL it can be useful having shitty graphics at times. Bushes are out of place l, so I can see through them, and most trees are also fully transparent. Player built floors are also completely invisible. I've caught people with a 140 tac hit, when they through to break my floors, with this."
FortNiteBR,ffer876,t3_et8ker,1579861530.0,Fortnite? There are numerous aim courses

FortniteCompetitive,ffeosp0,t1_ffeom7r,1579857875.0,"True. It's minimal on pc. Although there is definitely not no input lag. 

That still has to do with FPS though"
FortniteCompetitive,ffeomhj,t1_ffeof14,1579857612.0,So he can claim the prize money without you contesting him. This is comp after all :3
FortniteCompetitive,ffeokpz,t1_ffeoizd,1579857534.0,Not everyone has the luxury of a full 240 fps
FortniteCompetitive,ffeo5lo,t3_et7ucg,1579856901.0,Take a short brake. I honestly get triggered when I consistently die. Watch something funny on the Internet or go and talk to someone really helps
FortniteClips,ffen7wu,t3_es6gcf,1579855512.0,Could you share your sens? I'm on 30fps.  Clix settings feel way too fast below 60
FortniteCompetitive,ffen3pv,t3_et77d0,1579855342.0,"He's An idea: decrease strength of aim assist depending on FPS.

Eg: 

0-90fps = 100% aim assist
90-120 = 95%
120-180 = 85%
180-240 = 80%"

FortniteCompetitive,ffekvha,t1_ffek5p5,1579852315.0,"^ this

I don't care really. Someone tried something like this on me a few weeks ago. Unfortunately for them because of my graphics I could see them through the bush. And was able to hit them for a good 120 before the even tried to fire back. 

It doesn't involve building or aiming, which is the point of a competitive playstyle.  Dont get me wrong. This is OK if you just want the dub (I won my first solo by hiding *inside* a mountain, but if you compete in the world Cup, don't expect this to work too well. 

its more luck of getting a bush and an rpg. Than skill that's all."
FortNiteBR,ffekb7s,t3_et6w0e,1579851588.0,I mean the skins isn't great at best.

FortNiteBR,ffeib0z,t1_ffeg6bp,1579849147.0,Yea. But someone still needed to have the I phone though no?
FortNiteBR,ffehvz1,t3_et6egh,1579848654.0,"I wouldn't worry. As your friend got it as he's supposed ro, then they'll have to give it back.

If not it's possible they wont be able to entirely be sure. In which case, keeping asking Epic to give it back, and they may do so."
FortNiteBR,ffeh8ak,t1_ffegbeo,1579847907.0,"Posts like this make me sick.
