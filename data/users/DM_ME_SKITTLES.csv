cars,ffc81yj,t1_ffbx84y,1579793674.0,"I agree with the Blazer. However, I really think Chevy missed the mark with how they revamped it. It's just like a Chevy Traverse but a bit smaller and more sporty styled. So... basically a waste. 

What they should've done is gone old school cool with it. Like the original Chevy Blazer of the 70s/80s like a K5 Blazer. Would've competed in a segment they don't compete in like against Rubicons/wranglers and the Ford concept Bronco. 

A revamped K5 Blazer would have been SICK. And true to the old Blazers."

I adopted a dog from a shelter 5 years ago. He was 3mo. Old and weighed 13-15lbs. The shelter thought he was a ""terrier mix"" I thought he had some doberman mixed with terrier until  anemployee of mine found it and he was exactly the breed we discovered: australian Kelpie. He grew to be 38-40lbs. Characteristic, size, and personality all confirmed that he was a Kelpie. 

I took a biomedical ethics class in college. We did a project on DNA testing... it is far from accurate. I didn't waste my time or money on having my goodboi tested. Just my two cents."

I think looks help to appear more ""charming"" and funny to females but your friends all know you ain't funny. 

This happened to me in Vegas during a bachelor party, except I just appointed myself the one to approach... because reasons. Sure enough we started all partying with this big bachelorette party filled with 8s (they were the married ones) and 9-10s. The bachelorette's bestie and cousin ended up winning the Vegas pool partys booty shaking contest, to put things a bit into more perspective. 

We end up leaving and one of them gets my number. A few hours later I get a text asking what room we wanted to preparty in... they were bringing a handle of vodka to treat us to. 
After prepartying we go our separate ways as they had VIP bottles at a club and we had bottles at a gentleman's club...
Didn't know if we'd meet up again.

AskMen,feo44y3,t1_fenru19,1579294893.0,"This just reminded me of an ex I have. It was eye opening to me to realize that very attractive women can be very insecure in themselves. I'm not saying that about you at all, just the coffee/bar story reminded me of some interactions she and I would have. 

Similar things would happen to both of us but the way we handled ourselves was completely opposite. If I got hit on in front of her it was like a storm cloud would instantly appear raining on her. She would be PISSED at the female *and* me, even if I was completely ignoring or putting off the other girls advances. When she got hit on at a bar I'd just be like make sure he buys you two! (So I could have the other one, she'd even tell them she was with someone). 

One time we were together for NYE and she went to the restroom. A girl sat down next to me and desperately was trying to chat me up for that NYE kiss. I finally had to tell her, ""my gf is in the bathroom. If she comes out and sees you talking to me, she's *going to kill us both!* please leave me alone!"" 

Then after we broke up, my observations are: seeing very attractive females date unattractive guys... like total mismatched. I go on to believe it's either for money and/or for the girls insecurities because she doesn't want her man to get hit on or have the possibility of getting with a more attractive girl."

AskHistory,fen0qpr,t3_eq18ww,1579274381.0,"From the many Vietnam accounts I've read and listened to on audiobooks:

It was because the machine gunner of that company was already carrying a heavier load than the rest of the infantry troops. Their machine gun was already 2-3x heavier than their companies M16s and grease guns. Plus they had to carry, in some accounts, 800 rounds of a heavier ammo (.308 vs the M16s 5.56mm ammo). 

So in order to help share the load they would break the machine gunner's ammo into 100 round strips and allow other troops to help carry the extra 600-800 rounds.

Also, think about weight distribution. If you're lugging your water, MREs, gun, body armor and other equipment miles through the jungle, how hard would it be to carry a 60lb ammo box in one hand or attached to their pack? Pretty damn tough I imagine! I have some of .50 cal ammo boxes that I use to store my rounds in and they're pretty burdensome to carry into and out of a gun range.
Versus being able to carry strips of ammo on your body such as slung around your neck and chest. It would help a lot to be able to carry it on various places on the body instead of in one heavy ammo can."
