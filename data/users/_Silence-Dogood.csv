AskReddit,fdlgrlt,t1_fdlfn5x,1578523679.0,"Just moved back to west coast after 5 years out there, 3 in Georgia, 2 in CO. Worked towers, so obviously the surrounding states as well. Maybe they picked up I'm not from there, that's all I can think of. From my travels, it's only the local places or family owned that hold culture like that. Corporate chains absolutely do not though, no matter where - applebees n McDonald's etc. Cant remember waffle house did this or not, think they served unsweet no matter where."
AskReddit,fdlfgww,t1_fdldci5,1578522885.0,"Lived in GA for 3 years, worked utilities from Montana to Florida, and from the west coast originally. BS - I have always had to ask for unsweet or they ask first, if I dont or they dont, its sweet. GA is as Corporate as the rest, zaxbys is zaxbys no matter where you go. The only, and I mean the only places I was ever served unsweet without question was a family owned restaurant and the other a small southern bbq chain. It wasn't Atlanta or any immediate surrounding city either. Hell, even the craw fish place hole in the wall didnt serve unsweet. This is a belief from there, not a fact."

It will out you as a spy... all Americans are the same in the tea fact of sweet/unsweet."
postmates,fdk96xx,t1_fdh8dgj,1578498923.0,"Na, it's just the customer forgetting or not tipping at all. They used to remind you to rate and tip after delivery, doesn't anymore like it used to, it's right after drop off for me and only one. They dont see it again till the next time they order, could be a week, a day, whenever they open the app... and then they like to just skip it and order want they want right now, they'll tip if decent."

Futurology,fc6xxnk,t1_fc6vr46,1577492351.0,"Not really. 1750-1900 You are talking of a time Technology developed higher possibly once or twice per decade, if even that. This is over a span of multiple generations as well. It changed the world, made some living easier or better, but did so over a long time.
 Now, new Technology literally doubles every 2 years - biology (like genetics) doubles every single day. Cant have today without it, but cant compare to today."
