Wellthatsucks,fe6t8f5,t1_fe6t78n,1578904339.0,I'm also wondering but I'm not really sure I want to know
socialanxiety,fdr6yez,t1_fdr68fy,1578680298.0,"Yeah same, they don't show it but they read some part of it. When they read mine, even though they don't say I wrote it, it makes me so uncomfortable and my face goes red lol, everyone can guess it's me"
socialanxiety,fdqk6ce,t1_fdqib7n,1578668645.0,"They sometimes do it in highschool where I live, but they don't say whose assignment it is. Like, they only take it as an example when it's good."
socialanxiety,fdqk10r,t1_fdqc5uk,1578668544.0,"They started having anxiety in the middle of 2018 and now they feel like no one understands them except for online people, they only have friends online, they just want to be like others and they even wonder why they're still alive (they see suicide as an option)"
socialanxiety,fdn7epo,t1_fdn781w,1578579323.0,"Oh that's a good idea. I'll try to tell myself that I'll probably never see them again instead of thinking ""wow they probably think I'm super weird"". Thanks!"
socialanxiety,fdn5516,t3_em9r77,1578577558.0,Proud of you!
socialanxiety,fdmxse0,t3_em89av,1578570570.0,"I feel you, it's really embarrassing when the others notice it. Like when I'm blushing during a presentation and people tell me ""your face is red"" like wow thanks I hadn't noticed (used to have red hair, they would say ""you're as red as your hair"" and it would make things even worse)
But I think your answer was the best you could've given. It's okay to be nervous, no one should be ashamed of it!"
socialanxiety,fdmu4b6,t1_fdmtreq,1578565876.0,"I guess talking to cashiers got easier cause I keep going to the same supermarket so I got used to it, I think (even though it's still a bit stressful because I have to put all my items in my bag and I feel like everyone is getting upset if I don't do it super quickly) but presentations are still the worst. My face goes red, people notice it, I'm shaking really much etc. Once it's over I don't see it as a success but more as the end of a nightmare... I'll try seeing it differently next time. 
I'm not sure I have social anxiety though. I've learned about it a few days ago and I was like ""wow everything makes sense now"", but I haven't been diagnosed (maybe I'll talk to a therapist but it's stressful lol)."
socialanxiety,fdmtnhx,t1_fdmrux5,1578565236.0,Well... I've done multiple presentations and it's not getting less stressful
socialanxiety,fdmrynf,t1_fdm0r9d,1578562827.0,Presentations are a real nightmare
socialanxiety,fdkvq2g,t1_fdkp2cr,1578512142.0,Easier said than done though
socialanxiety,fdi9l3g,t1_fdhyoa0,1578438195.0,"I learned about social anxiety a few days ago and I was like ""wow, all my life suddenly makes sense"" 
But of course only a therapist can tell if I really have social anxiety but, well, the idea of talking to a therapist is scary. So I'm just wondering if I do have it or if I'm just faking it to get attention. Pretty fun"
socialanxiety,fdhwr26,t3_eleuqx,1578431546.0,How come y'all know where it comes from while I have literally no idea
socialanxiety,fdh9p8j,t1_fdg46f8,1578418407.0,What if the idea of talking to a therapist is scary
