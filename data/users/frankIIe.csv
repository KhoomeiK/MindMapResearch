careeradvice,ffav1ja,t3_esczbk,1579745148.0,"OP, you have two choices. Either you sit down with your boss and have THE talk, or you find another place. Let me suggest you find another place and if they are hiring you then you can confront your boss. Or not. Depends on how you value him as a person. I would just go."
whatdoIdo,ff9oalp,t3_esf6en,1579717170.0,This depends a lot on the kind of values and principles that were held in your family home. Would you care to give some context? Because « normal people » often have their first sexual experiences around that age or even younger. I’d figure a family talk would suffice in this kind of situation.

For example, at my previous job they never gave me a raise, so I told my next employer ""it was time for me to have better living conditions in life"". Also, they vaguely suggested they would promote me but never went through with the idea, so ""I couldn't fulfill my career ambitions with them"". Precise enough yet still vague."

Add into it that you’d be the most qualified to do it (strengthened by the fact they asked you) but you say you don’t want to.

Also, it would be out of the question to assume a role with increased responsibility without the compensation. You will obviously demand it if they don’t mention it. It’s not charity it’s the work market!

Imho, you’re afraid to fail. Take the time to weight in everything about this situation I’m pretty sure the right choice will come to you soon enough. Best wishes!"

Meditation,fdzpekd,t1_fdzorfj,1578792836.0,"Well you’re not coming across as combative, but considering your initial reply, more like, annoyed by disagreeing opinions. And to address this comment, the ability to be detached from emotion comes with time but to be able to reach that state you have to learn quiet and stillness. Trying to trigger joy, imho, is definitely going to interfere, and will hinder your progress. If a burst of joy occurs great, live it to the fullest in acceptation!

But if deep sadness or anger comes, accept it as well. If you’re trying to force joy but the opposite comes out, I see this as very wrong.
