I remember being in my room and just hearing my mom and dad shit talking about everything I did. One of the things they still do is down play anything I do. For example recently I was hyped because I got an internship that I am really looking forward to doing. When I told my mom she said and I quote “ok?”. I feel like for this reason I never have confidence in myself.
