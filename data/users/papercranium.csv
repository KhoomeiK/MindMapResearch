WGU,ffqjk4m,t3_eunumg,1580136359.0,"This isn't me (I'm at WGU because my boss wants me to be more promotable), but it doesn't matter where you go to school, it's extremely hard to get a job with just a degree and no experience. If people were ready to deal with folks without professional experience, they'd hire an intern. It's an expensive and frustrating process, training folks fresh out of school who don't understand the workplace. 

The better question is: what are you doing to get experience and build relationships before graduation?"

We also have a fair number of folks reach out to us because they like our products. While we don't end up partnering with most of the people who ask us about it, we do take some up on the offer. Those who are off-topic or too broad or have obviously bought their followers or appeal to the wrong demographic for our current campaigns we don't. 

We also sometimes find folks because they regularly tag us in posts/stories in which they use our products, especially newer products or those we are expecting to promote heavily. We do take note of any verified IG users who tag us, in particular. Often they turn out to be verified for unrelated reasons (a journalist who uses our product at home, for example), but sometimes it turns up a useful lead."
WGU,ff0x7dt,t3_er1ex5,1579473166.0,"Part of the point of WGU is that there are no degrees offered that don't point directly at some kind of a career (even though folks will always have varying degrees of success with that step).

No, I can't train with my friends for a marathon, but I'm quite happy to go on walks with them. What happens when my friends want to take a yoga class and I can't do it? Why, they go to yoga class without me, and I do my physical therapy at home or read a book, and we meet up for tea after. When my friends want to hike fast, they go on their own. When they want to take their time and rest a lot, they go with me. And you may be shocked to hear that they're happy to do it! Because they're real friends.
