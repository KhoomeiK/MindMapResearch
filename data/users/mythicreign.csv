AskReddit,ffqaq27,t1_ffpycyg,1580128477.0,"It played more like a tactical rpg that required a grid than a normal one. The combat is actually done quite well but that was really the focus of the game and so it neglected things outside of that. Still, it introduced certain mechanics or ideas that either made it to 5E or that people still use in their homebrews so it wasn’t remotely all bad."
AdviceAnimals,ffo44ki,t3_eu8f7w,1580073934.0,"Because I can pay $10 for a movie that entertains me for 2 hours but going to the doctor usually involves an hour of waiting, some tests that don’t determine what is actually wrong with me, and a copay of $60+. Healthcare, along with plenty of other stuff, is fucked in America. Entertainment is just a distraction from how fucked everything is."
amiugly,ffiiior,t1_ffi22s4,1579974685.0,That’s a polite way to say it.
wow,ff7by5r,t1_ff74aja,1579645947.0,Totally agree. Wrath and Legion are my top xpacs of all time. Almost as soon as I hit max level in BFA I quit and haven’t looked back.
MortalKombat,ff520ry,t1_ff4wv6x,1579578085.0,I’ve never liked Epcar as Joker either. I think it’s his laughs that I hate most.
wow,ff219e7,t1_fezw2yo,1579491095.0,I hate gnomes. But if mechagnomes were done properly I’d probably like them a lot more than regular gnomes. The problem is they weren’t done properly.

gaming,fekqx66,t1_fekqg95,1579205761.0,I’m looking forward to just about all of them so it’s slightly disappointing but whatever. My birthday is in September and perhaps they’re actually just pushing these releases closer to the next gen consoles (where I’m sure they’ll also appear.)
gaming,fekqbc8,t1_fekji6y,1579205402.0,"That’s what I thought when I heard the news too. I’m sure all these games are close enough to completion that they could physically release in the next month or two, but they’re all such potentially big games that publishers are playing chicken with each other or something. Oh well."
RPGdesign,fek6ufl,t1_fek537t,1579193828.0,"Well we’re not doing it just because we don’t want d20 or dice pools, that’s just an added piece of information. We like the clean, non-binary action resolution and intuitive nature of PbtA. 


Initially the game was being designed with more of a D&D feel, but certain things weren’t working for us. We think PbtA is a solid system that can accommodate the fast-paced action we want, and we’ve moved away from those concepts like move speed or positioning etc. So no worries there. 


However, some PbtA games like Dungeon World have shown that having concrete classes, levels, HP, and variable damage dice can work. I don’t think that is a detriment to the game’s design, I personally find it appealing. 


The question is whether it would still be fun if you pushed it slightly further. For example, if you increased the level cap and potential power gain, and included many more choices that modify moves rather than tossing a ton of new moves at players. 


The goal isn’t to “betray” what PbtA is about, but to introduce more concrete character “upgrades” and offer exciting or amusing perks and advantages to players. As I mentioned before, our game’s flavor is one of the highlights and part of the reason we want to emphasize this increased number of options is to show this flavor off more."
RPGdesign,fek3drt,t1_fek0nlm,1579191756.0,"It does help, thanks. 


Just to clarify though, you like DW (as do I) but don’t enjoy HP or damage dice, correct? Do you mean to say that you’ve strayed away from DW but it still holds a place in your heart because it was your first PbtA game? Or do you still sometimes play DW but perhaps tone down the damage dice and hp in some way? 


I’m just trying to get a sense of whether you’d try a new PbtA game that does have hp and damage dice or if that’s a dealbreaker for you."
RPGdesign,fejwvvs,t1_fejvrje,1579187704.0,"Thanks for the reply, but what PbtA games are specifically your favorites? And what thing(s) unique to each one would you pinpoint as the reason why?"
RPGdesign,fejwrhd,t1_feju7fm,1579187624.0,That’s fair. I guess we could simply state that it’s inspired by PbtA but holds some differences. Much like how Blades in the Dark was built on it but was different enough that it sort of stuck out as it’s own FitD system.
RPGdesign,fejwmmf,t1_fejvx0a,1579187537.0,"I totally understand what you’re saying, which is why I’m asking this question. The goal isn’t to overdo it, but we have a unique setting with unique flavor and we want to highlight that by baking it into the character options. I think that part will pay off. 

We also want scaling hp/damage that goes beyond just tracking single wounds or big hits. I’m not talking about getting into the D&D territory of hundreds of hp and your party can’t lose, but I personally like a sense of escalation and being more powerful after 10 sessions than you were during the first. It’s just a matter of how to pull this off without overwhelming people or compromising the general elegance and ease of use of PbtA."

Whether the guy is telling the truth or not, it doesn’t impact you or anybody else here. There is no tangible benefit for this dude either way."

todayilearned,fe82ulu,t1_fe7u7we,1578921847.0,"You can definitely see it that way. You can also take it jokingly as if it’s saying “wrestling is super cool and it’s also really gay, so gay people must be pretty cool too.” I’m not saying it’s never used negatively, but I don’t think it was being used to disparage wrestling as much as it ways to take the stigma off of being gay."
todayilearned,fe7rzpy,t1_fe7p53t,1578918557.0,"It depends on how you look at it but the purpose isn’t to insult, it’s to say “you see these big manly dudes that could probably kill the majority of us with their bare hands? They spend all their time hugging, grabbing, and rolling around with other dudes, sometimes with their faces in each others’ crotches.” It’s meant to draw comparisons in a way that makes homosexuality seem less weird and deviant. Yes, it does so at the expense of wrestling, but so what? You can’t deny that man-on-man action is exactly what it is."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe61uwe,t1_fe60698,1578879905.0,Mine too. But I don’t feel sick. Everybody needs to get it once in a while. That’s just reality.

NintendoSwitch,fdraqzn,t3_emsett,1578681823.0,Good list. But can I say I really miss Gamerankings.com and don’t find Metacritic all that effective/easy to use? It’s hard to filter things in the exact ways you want.

AskReddit,fdgnpj7,t3_el2az5,1578403360.0,Harley Quinn from the new animated series. Score. Assuming she doesn’t kill me. Or Selina from VEEP. Still score. Julia is more attractive nowadays than when she was on Seinfeld if you ask me.
AskReddit,fdgnixp,t1_fdfvknb,1578403200.0,"The Office was the same way, and there are numerous other acclaimed shows out there that started really rough. The key is to know which shows are just bad and which just didn’t know what to do with their characters yet. I dunno if you’ve ever seen Justified but the first season was the weakest, and that’s partly because one of the best characters (Boyd Crowder) hadn’t “become himself” yet, much like Parks and Rec. The show really picked up from season 2 onward."

funny,fdcvzpj,t1_fdculz5,1578285912.0,"This is exactly what I think it is. We’ve all entertained ridiculous or dangerous hypotheticals, especially while drunk or high, but rich people can totally do those things at will if they pay enough money. At some point even the most normal person with enough cash to blow could end up saying “I’m really bored, might as well try this crazy, illegal activity.”"
AskReddit,fd9px2i,t3_ekd29h,1578236562.0,"I’ve had a few. One in particular was the best and worst, in a sense. I don’t have any kids in real life but in this one dream I had a young daughter. Probably no older than 5. It’s been a while so details aren’t clear. But I can tell you that I experienced that love a parent has for a child in that dream. I wasn’t devastated when I woke up, on the contrary that love and warmth kind of made me realize what I might have one day. I’m currently married and I was at the time of the dream too, but the issue is that my wife doesn’t think she wants kids, we aren’t financially stable, we’ve had various other problems, and I’m not even sure we can have kids. The more time that passes, the more I forgot the way I felt in the dream little by little and probably won’t get that back, even in real life. That’s the hard part."

amiugly,fd6b0ch,t3_ejy25x,1578188228.0,"I’d say ditch the glasses and dress in a way that downplays your overly long and lanky arms. Your face isn’t the issue really. Attitude is the biggest turn-on (or turn-off) for women, so don’t act like a goon who wants pity. 


I get it to a degree, because I’m not a good looking guy either. I’ve dated some beautiful girls and some unattractive ones, of various ages and races. I’ve also been married for 5 years now. How you carry yourself and treat people will make up the difference for whatever you lack in physical appearance. Be smart, be funny, be kind (bonus: be good with your hands and mouth.) Yes, being a handsome mother fucker would somewhat negate the need to actually be a cool human being, but you aren’t gonna change reality by wishing so you simply need to adapt. 


Worse comes to worst, be realistic. You’re a normal dude, not a stud. Find someone who you mesh with and share interests with. Maybe they aren’t a total babe at first glance but all that stuff about inner beauty isn’t total bullshit. Be open-minded and you might find what you’re looking for. Just don’t beat yourself up for things you can’t control."
movies,fd2xlvm,t1_fd2jegi,1578152738.0,That’s how I felt about The Irishman. People are acting like it’s an amazing film and for me it doesn’t come close to most of Scorsese’s previous work. Maybe it has to do with personal expectations.

AskReddit,fcnk12b,t1_fcmqtu3,1577813122.0,It’s so illogical. Everybody loves sex. Almost everything we do is to obtain it. This is reflected in lots of media and stories. But somehow it’s twisted to seem sinful and indecent. Some people will fuck their cousins or molest kids in their care but seeing a nipple on tv is an outrage. Ridiculous shit.

bloodborne,fc9uns4,t1_fc9aqnu,1577558476.0,I beat Gascoigne on my first try when the game came out. I acknowledge that he’s no pushover but I would agree with you that BSB is more intimidating and challenging. Even Vicar Amelia was more trouble for me.
