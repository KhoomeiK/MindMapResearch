Psychonaut,fg09cwz,t1_ffzzy7s,1580403016.0,"That’s like me and the Challenger exploding. My dad remembers it clearly, but I was 2, so had no clue. I sincerely hope you don’t have to experience something like either of those in your adult memory. Even thinking about 9/11 makes me tear up to this day."
politics,fg08qnf,t1_fg02lnc,1580402641.0,I always thought he looked like Skeletor with skin.
Psychonaut,ffyz2vc,t1_ffyux8v,1580358898.0,"I’m not sure how old you are, but I’ve found most people who were old enough to grasp the gravity and impact of 9/11 tend to remember the day pretty vividly. My memory has gone to crap, but I definitely remember that day."
todayilearned,ffyhm87,t1_ffyfho9,1580346628.0,You’d still be a few hundred thousand people shy of 3.5%.
trees,ffya2cp,t1_ffy9v74,1580341532.0,I have and sadly it didn’t help. Fibromyalgia pain is a very different beast than other forms of chronic pain.
trees,ffy9q8m,t1_ffy9epa,1580341335.0,"Again, if you have another feasible option, I’m all ears. I do what I have to in order to get through the day. I don’t smoke immediately before driving and I’m not getting completely blazed throughout the day. 

It’s great that you haven’t been put in that position in your life. You’re lucky. Many of us aren’t so lucky."
trees,ffy7h36,t1_ffy6xob,1580340047.0,"Not so much upset, but it is a touchy subject for me. Also it may be partially because I’m in incredible pain and am almost out of flower (which is how I manage pain currently). If it seemed I was taking it out on you, I’m sorry. That wasn’t my intent."
trees,ffy6r2g,t1_ffy6fep,1580339639.0,"You going to pay for us to move? Because we certainly can’t. We can barely make ends meet as it is. And I applied for disability and was denied after 6 years. Plus how am I supposed to get groceries? Or get to doctors appointments? Or anything else I need to do?

And yes, I know you can have groceries delivered now and we do, but that only became available within the last year or so."

Damnthatsinteresting,ffy5us7,t1_ffy5q9k,1580339134.0,"I’ve never seen those studies. They’d be interesting to read though. Anecdotally, the only time my kids get hyper is from chocolates. Otherwise sugar has no effect."
trees,ffy5ptl,t1_ffx4cwq,1580339057.0,"I’m not on those meds anymore and my driving has been retested by the state. I’m fine. 

Here’s a hypothetical for you then. How would you get around to do what you need in a city like mine? It’s spread out, so walking/biking won’t work. Our public transit system is crap with very limited routes. Uber/taxis certainly aren’t affordable on a single income."
trees,ffy5c26,t1_ffxq5ff,1580338843.0,"I wouldn’t drive immediately after taking my meds. I’d do my morning driving, then take meds, then I wouldn’t drive again for at least 5 hours. Also, please tell me how I’m supposed to function without pain relief when my best days are 3/10 on the pain scale?"
Damnthatsinteresting,ffy526l,t1_ffy39q0,1580338691.0,"If the sugary item is or has chocolate, that’s probably the cause. Chocolate contains some caffeine."
Damnthatsinteresting,ffy4qki,t1_ffy15wi,1580338515.0,Wasps are dicks. Full stop.

trees,ffv63g1,t1_ffuzux5,1580256562.0,"I’m right there with you. I smoke to make my fibro pain bearable. If I don’t, my pain becomes a major distraction. Without the pain I can sit and focus on my driving. 

And before anyone starts with other methods of pain control, I took opiates for 5 years. They caused many problems, including driving, that we didn’t realize were from the meds until I came off of them. I’ve also done all the other “have you tried this” ideas and nothing has worked as well as marijuana."
femalehairadvice,ffur4ri,t3_evavt3,1580247748.0,This cut looks amazing on you!
weed,ffuqrjt,t1_ffpf09k,1580247539.0,Fair enough. I may have misinterpreted it. But don’t count out the placebo effect. Most people get it for one thing or another and some are highly affected by it.

sadcringe,ffsrppv,t1_ffsiebx,1580190065.0,"My favorite is pepperoni, bacon, pineapple, and jalapeño. You get sweet, salty, umami, and spice all at once. It’s an experience."

PresidentialRaceMemes,ffmsw60,t1_ffmfmap,1580058574.0,"I’d take either one of them, though. Or better yet, both. A Warren/Sanders ticket, or vice versa, would be amazing."

todayilearned,ffm7iqq,t1_ffm7gl6,1580049776.0,Thanks! And no problem. Reddit has actually made me a better person because of people not being afraid of calling out your bullshit.
todayilearned,ffm6vkt,t1_ffm62hd,1580049548.0,"I made a “not like other girls” statement on Reddit and had a bunch of people call me out. They pointed out that we’re all women’s for we share the same struggles, that cutting other women down does nothing but create a divide, and that judging women based on makeup/clothes/hobbies is petty and dumb. I started out trying to justify, but realized they were correct. So, thanks Reddit for fixing my terrible view. :)"
agedlikemilk,ffm5r49,t1_ffm280b,1580048957.0,Too late. There’s already at least one US case.
todayilearned,ffm2hja,t1_ffm0oaa,1580047483.0,I used to be one of those “I don’t get along with other girls” types. Then it was pointed out what a stupid mentality I had (I did) and I did some hard thinking. Now about half of my friends group is women and they’re the best.
weed,ffltir3,t1_ffk2qc6,1580043931.0,Smoking definitely messes with your lungs. It’s such a bad habit.
weed,ffltfde,t1_ffk2jf1,1580043877.0,"The placebo effect has been scientifically proven time and time again. It’s even frequently seen in double blind studies for medications. 

Also, no reason to be a jerk. Dude said one thing, I countered with my thoughts on it. He even agreed placebo effect might have something to do with it. Chill, man."
weed,ffjsd4t,t1_ffjqdv0,1580005643.0,I have a coughing fit no matter what. That’s probably thanks to smoking cigarettes (which I’m trying to quit... again).
weed,ffjs9dj,t1_ffjnob5,1580005562.0,That’s a good analogy. :)
weed,ffjs7us,t1_ffjmz7s,1580005528.0,Have you seen what the federal government allows for research? It’s the dirt weed I used to get in high school. It’s no wonder we don’t know a whole lot about it.
weed,ffjmubn,t1_ffjmdtt,1580001900.0,"From what I read, you absorb 80-90% of the active THC in the smoke almost immediately. So holding longer can absorb more, but not any significant amount. I may be remembering that wrong, though."
AskReddit,ffjmp9y,t1_ffjmbhs,1580001802.0,You too. :)
weed,ffjmonx,t1_ffjmaga,1580001790.0,That is true. We still don’t know what all terpenes there are or how all of them work in the human body.
AskReddit,ffjlwto,t1_ffjlr8y,1580001268.0,"I apologize for assuming you didn’t respect pronouns. I disagree with your assessment on chromosomes, but I can appreciate that you are respectful and agree trans folks should have equal rights. :)"
AskReddit,ffjlcdd,t1_ffjkncs,1580000882.0,"Intersex is more common than transgender folks. Intersex is about [1.7% of the population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12476264/). Transgender folks make up roughly [0.3% of the US population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5227946/). So, for one, you still didn’t answer my question about intersex people. And two, why does it matter to you what 0.3% of Americans have in their pants vs outward gender? Don’t be a dick and respect people’s preferred pronouns and such. It’s not hard to do either of those things."
