BabyBumps,few405q,t3_eqnqn2,1579405033.0,"I just gave birth to my third. I hated my stretch marks after my first, hated them after my second, but after this baby and postpartum hell I look at my extra fat, flabby skin, and stretch marks and just love them. I love my body for giving me my babies. I promise, one day you’ll be holding your baby and be amazed at what your body gave you, and those stretch marks won’t make you feel so bad. You’re amazing, try to remember that on rough days. 💕"
BabyBumps,fes7unu,t3_eqfwdb,1579362287.0,I thought I was texting my SIL about my placenta... was talking to my BIL. Apparently I got the numbers switches when I saved them in my phone.
breakingmom,fenei5e,t3_epwoya,1579282964.0,"I’m going to be honest, if I wasn’t able to be a SAHM there is absolutely no way I would be able to feed anything other than formula. I have SO much respect for moms who pump, because it takes soooooooo much effort. You’re a fucking rockstar for making it 11 days, let alone 11 months. Fuck your sister for saying that. You rule!"
facepalm,fek87t1,t1_fek82jb,1579194647.0,"Because she was 15 when this was taken, so it obviously wasn’t her car. The car belonged to the owner of the company her dad worked at, and those keys are obviously not Porsche keys."
facepalm,fek7l2f,t1_fek7crz,1579194271.0,"Yeah. I do, but if it makes you feel better to think I would lie about some dumb shit online then go for it. She’s a sweet girl, she’s a smart girl, and she’s a funny girl, and people online always rip her a new one because they don’t understand what the fuck a joke is."
facepalm,fek0nta,t3_ephy0o,1579190082.0,"Jesus Christ, I know this girl. I used to babysit her, knew her until she graduated HS. She posted this as a JOKE."
BabyBumps,fehvjty,t3_ep5p0q,1579124720.0,Congratulations! I absolutely love his name by the way. You’re a super woman for birthing a 9 lb baby!!!!
iamatotalpieceofshit,fehvdr6,t1_feh73gz,1579124622.0,"Yeah, I couldn’t watch it all the way through. This is exactly like what every single mandatory weekend visitation with my bio dad was like. Piece of fucking shit, I hope this girl is able to get some help with getting safe and therapy or counseling to help with the inevitable long term impact abuse like this creates."
survivorsofabuse,fefmqt0,t1_fefhlx0,1579059688.0,Of course.
survivorsofabuse,fef0t7v,t3_eoo1s9,1579045512.0,"You didn’t deserve any of this. Abuse and trauma isn’t comparable either. Just because your mom was abused doesn’t mean you weren’t. What happened to her wasn’t “worse” than what happened to you, it’s all in how your psyche handles it. If I were you I would try not to look for validation from your mother, as it seems she is not willing to admit to you (or likely herself) that she allowed her child to be abused. 

I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this, but try to remember that you’re an incredibly strong person and you do have the capability to overcome this. If you ever need someone to vent to or want someone to talk you, please don’t hesitate to message me."
AskMen,fee5zt7,t1_fedpr0u,1579027107.0,"I totally agree with you. He is a saint of a man. I am not an easy woman to be with (not proud of that btw) and I would always get super insecure because he didn’t want to fix things right at that moment. Honestly though, I think a lot of it had to do with our age difference. He’s 13 years older than me and had 13 more years of adult relationships to learn how to communicate well and have productive disagreements, where I was so immature and ready to fight for the sake of drama. In my opinion, one of the biggest parts of “growing up” is being able to disagree in a way that doesn’t cause huge rifts in the relationship and letting go of that adolescent need for drama, and for us that meant giving space and time to think.


Also, your username gave me a much needed laugh today."
AskMen,fedtql5,t1_fedtp0d,1579019701.0,Honestly? Couples counseling and individual therapy for codependency.
AskMen,fedfdk9,t1_fedf064,1579010012.0,Tbh that sounds a little bit like codependency.
AskMen,febs3b3,t1_febokvf,1578962039.0,"No, to be honest for five years he’s told me “I’ll talk to you later after I’ve cooled down, I don’t want to talk now.”

I guess it was just so fucking unfathomable to me that someone didn’t want to talk about their feelings right away because that’s what I want. 


Side note: I married the most patient man in the world, god bless him."
AskMen,febmwmr,t1_febl27d,1578960568.0,"It took five years for me to learn that my husband does not want to talk about his feelings immediately after he gets hurt/frustrated/angry and that I need to just leave him the fuck alone. Wish I would’ve learned quicker, but hey, at least I’ve got it now."
science,fe2tdmz,t1_fe1apnf,1578842658.0,"I just gave birth to my third, and this was the first time anyone mentioned getting those shots to me. It wasn’t even my OBGYN, but a pharmacist while I was picking up a script."
beyondthebump,fdtobbh,t3_en0n12,1578719680.0,I keep getting these ads mailed to my house. I just had my third kid and have never been to a plastic surgeon. I actually called the place and bitched about it. My husband thought I was overreacting until I asked him how he’d feel if I’m his 40th birthday a bunch of doctors sent him ads for viagra.
breakingmom,fdkh102,t3_elt7j7,1578503700.0,"Similar but not the same, my 3 year old will only eat peas if they’re frozen. Kids are weird."
breakingmom,fdkeue9,t1_fdkeq8m,1578502372.0,God I needed that laugh right now. Thank you
breakingmom,fdis6mc,t1_fdis4eo,1578449851.0,"My response was “go fuck yourself, right in your own pompous ass.”"
breakingmom,fdirvxk,t1_fdir8wr,1578449658.0,"Thank you for the validation. We have a big back yard and we live in a very warm state, there was no reason the kids couldn’t have gone outside with him to run around and had him 1000 feet away from them smoking."
breakingmom,fdirrt2,t1_fdir4k9,1578449587.0,"Right? And he refuses to apologize because “he doesn’t apologize to people acting like assholes” 

Anyone would lose it in that situation. He’s trying to tell me that he would calmly tell me he was upset. Fuck that noise, he would be irritated as hell"
breakingmom,fdh8j4v,t3_elclik,1578417697.0,"So our bathroom has a tub and a weird half wall the toilet sits behind. I went pee when the two toddlers were in the bath and could see their faces in the mirror, but not the rest of them. All of a sudden I see my 18 month old playing with a weird toy. 


Nope. It was shit. Her sister pooped and she took it as an opportunity to engage in some.... creative playtime. 


Solidarity momma. You’re the bomb."
breakingmom,fdgy9e5,t1_fdgevtx,1578411267.0,"Came here to say this. Our three year old was having night terrors and would get really upset before bedtime (even with us in bed with her) and would vomit. Not intentional on her part though, just anxiety."
pregnant,fcudgea,t3_eiwk6k,1577978374.0,Congratulations!!!
survivorsofabuse,fcogrwc,t3_ei8qve,1577831856.0,"I literally went through this. Seriously, it’s weirding me out how similar our stories are. I broke up with him after one of many bad fights, and he broke into my apartment a week later saying he was going to kill me. The dumbass called and told me he was on the way so I called the cops and they were waiting for him (he had a history of DV charges so I think they took it seriously). 

I STILL cried over the relationship ending. I think for me it was more about the shame I felt for allowing myself to be treated that way for so long. For me, it was all about really low self esteem and he took advantage of that. If you can afford it, therapy would help. If you can’t, you can send me a message and vent/talk.

I’m really sorry you’re going through this. You are worthy of being treated well. It’s hard to remember that when you’ve been told you’re not for so long, but please try to remember that you are worthy of love, worthy of respect, and that you need to show yourself some grace and compassion right now because you’re going through a lot."
breastfeeding,fclstj4,t3_eho0ik,1577755609.0,I want a baby blanket with this on it. That way when people give me the stink eye I can just lay it out on my lap for them to read.
AlAnon,fca1a75,t1_fc9wuau,1577561420.0,I’m sorry you had to deal with that. Moving forward I would just calmly tell her you think this a boundary that shouldn’t be crossed. AA and AlAnon is all about boundaries so she should understand that means to back the fuck off.
AlAnon,fc90m0w,t3_egqmpl,1577545101.0,That’s crazy inappropriate. If my SOs sponsors wife called me I would be very uncomfortable
pregnant,fc90cmn,t3_egmoe2,1577544985.0,"Honestly, for me, newborn was the easiest phase. However, I didn’t have issues with feeding, colic, or recovery from a c section, so I understand that isn’t everyone’s experience"
pregnant,fc74kgr,t3_eghs8s,1577497359.0,"I’m due with my third girl in 2.5 weeks. Every time someone finds out it’s another girl they get disappointed or ask if we will keep trying for a boy. People are assholes. Girls are the best, my two little ladies are amazing and I’m sure yours will be too."
pregnant,fanm9jo,t1_fan9cph,1576244889.0,"Thank you, that helps a lot actually"
