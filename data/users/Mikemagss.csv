I'm sorry but this explains so many points with insignificant effect on the result. 

Halo Reach was LITERALLY the reason halo went from premiere esport to being pulled by MLG and losing its competitive scene. Its multiplayer polarized the community and it was terrible for competitive. 

I also personally feel its campaign was insanely cliche, boring, and poorly made (which I know many disagree with) so for me this game offers zero value. 

I'm glad halo is coming to PC, just not this one"
