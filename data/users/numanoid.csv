DaystromInstitute,ffetzna,t1_ffej2lv,1579865441.0,"> The issue is that a supernova by definition moves at the speed of light, warp 1. That's a huge amount of time (likely dozens or even hundreds of years) to deal with the issue and evacuate. Even if it was somehow next door to Romulus, they'd have several years to evac.

I don't understand your math. Light from the Sun, for instance, takes about 8 minutes (traveling at warp 1, obviously) to hit Earth. I imagine it would be roughly the same for Romulus and Hobus."

Got on board (after probably 50 people had already boarded) and in the third row there was a young lady on the aisle, and on the seat next to her was one of those cards. I quickly did the math in my head and figured that she must have bought two seats for whatever reason (she was a bit overweight but not pouring into the other seat or anything).
