AskReddit,ff58d8w,t3_erj9ln,1579583253.0,"Usually just involves being comfortable we with your full authentic self around those you care about, it can then be elevated by very small and benign signs of  affection. Usually if they are returned it is a good sign of rapport. This could mean the individual is comfortable around you, or reciprocating your subtle gestures / words / body language / glances, etc. It's been my experience that, if you are kind and authentic, most people warm up to you regardless. Obviously not everyone is romantically interested, but it can be a great way for starting friendships and courtships / relationships. That has been my experience. I have seen people in every demographic pull this off, and they always give off an essence of attractiveness. Take the most attractive person you know and fill them with doubt, loathing and add being guarded to the mix, they instantly become unattractive.

TL:DR Be your self, avoid being guarded, find / create joy in your life"

This is definitely a red mark on the Nintendo brand for me  though, I have lost trust with them. Also, how is their UI still so basic? O have so many downloads, I just want tile mode on start up. I fear they are stuck in the land of on decision because things are going so well. 

I feel this could potentially be shooting themselves in the foot for future consoles.

I think to be successful going forward, the enjoyment of the experience will have to outweigh the burdens. UI, and joycon fragility for me, are heavily weighted. I just plain expect more from a console maker at this point in time."
