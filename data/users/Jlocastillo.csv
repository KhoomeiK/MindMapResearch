JapanTravel,fefozwg,t3_eos1p5,1579061220.0,Not worth going for just 5 days.   I have traveled through Europe and Central America.   You will be exhausted when you get there and when you come back.  Jet lag is a bitch.   You will spend more time in airports than visiting places in your destination.   Way too much money for just a few days.   Plan your trip for when you have at least two weeks to give yourself enough time to see and do all you want to do at your destination.  Always fly on a Wed and come back on a Wed.   You will have at least two weekends during your trip and when you get back the weekend is around the corner again to recuperate from the trip.   You always need a vacation from a vacation.  Don’t do it!

Ewwwww.   The smell and stickiness.... Totally no cool.   Make her shower.   Perhaps you can suggest taking a shower together before sex."
