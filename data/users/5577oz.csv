I think with time they will become less intense (sorry don't remember how long), though I do still have vivid dreams but not on the same level. I found it helped me to write the dreams down - anything I remembered. It helped get it out of my head.

leaves,fflikrk,t3_eu4f7b,1580040042.0,"It will take time for your brain to rebalance itself. Your brain is so used to having weed elevate your dopamine levels that without it you can be left feeling very depressed. Just riding it out for longer may help.

Another possibility I encountered in my earlier attempts to quit was that I expected quitting to solve all my problems, and it was a huge blow when I was sober for a month or few and still unhappy with so many aspects of my life. It will likely take a lot more work to become the person you want to be in addition to being sober. That may not be your case and if it is don't worry about making changes while you are feeling depressed. Even if you can't get out of bed all day, if you didn't smoke you are on the right path and should feel proud of yourself. Thinking about things you want to do *eventually* might help you feel more hopeful about the future and give you some slight motivation/ happiness.

Give it more time and hang in there OP, I hope you start to have some good days soon. Have you noticed any small positive changes/ improvements? (even if they are currently overshadowed by depression)

jobs,ffhpx5y,t3_etjvb0,1579947623.0,"I just switched career fields and started a job in a new field this week.

I worked for ~6 years in the field I went to college for. But that included several different jobs - all contracts, nothing permanent. I liked the work, but it was 6 years of zero vacation time/ benefits/ sick days, and constantly job hunting and being stressed about being unemployed. Majority of my coworkers were in the same boat.

I realized all the jobs I was qualified for were contracts, or required extensive travel and spontaneously long hours which doesn't mesh with the type of lifestyle I want. I couldn't get excited about a future in the field, it just made me stressed.

I started having thoughts over a year ago about making a change, but it took a long time to admit to myself that was what I wanted (its hard to start over). I made a lot of pro/cons list for current career path vs a new one, estimates for where I could be in 5/10 years etc. I realized switching was the better outcome in the long term. I only started acting on it when my previous boss told me our department had orders to ""start winding down"" so I likely wouldn't even have a contract to return to.

My new job is still a fucking contract but at least it has better opportunities for stable employment down the road.

Your post reminds me of the saying ""people don't quit bad jobs, they quit bad bosses"". One of my previous bosses told me I should never feel bad for leaving a job and to always put myself first. If you are unhappy there, start looking for something else. Or if you feel you need to quit for your mental health don't feel guilty about it. You could try talking to them about the scheduling and if they won't budge on giving you the days off you require then give them notice you are quitting because you need to focus on school. Good luck OP hope things improve"

Though slowly the good days outnumbered the bad. I think 6 months is when I noticed a huge difference in my happiness/ energy and motivation. That is also around the time I quit eating fast food, started eating better meals, and being more active - so that has helped too (never would have the motivation to do it without quitting)

If I see people smoking weed in a tv show and its depicted in a positive way, I will get a small craving. But its not like it was in the beginning, its just something in the back of my mind that I know I won't give into.

I think something that really helped me out in the beginning was drawing a picture - where I added a single detail to it at the end of each day that I didn't smoke [(made a post about it a while ago)](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/bvxqiz/3_weeks_for_each_day_i_didnt_smoke_i_added/). Once the picture started taking shape it was an extra motivation because I didn't want to leave it unfinished, and it was sort of like a reward at the end of a day without smoking.

For me it also helped to break up quitting into smaller goals. I found it overwhelming to think about quitting forever (even though I knew that's what I wanted to do), I told myself to quit for 1 month and see how I felt. As 1 month approached I moved it to 3 months, then 6 months. And eventually I reached the point where I just don't want to go back. 

Similar idea when I had a bad craving, I would tell myself I could smoke in 1hr, and if I still wanted to smoke in an hour I would put it off for another hour, repeat until the craving passed - because they always pass. I think it helped make the cravings less intense because it was kinda convincing my brain that I only had to wait an hour to smoke instead of never being able to again. Might not work for everyone.

Last there are some motivational quotes I like to remind myself of:  
*the urge to smoke will pass whether you give in to it or not*  
*be stronger than your strongest excuse*

You are obviously at a very low point, that's why you're here, why you want to quit. Life changes are never easy. Remind yourself every day that by doing this you are strong and a better person than you were yesterday. I like to ask myself ""what would someone who loves themselves do?"""

I definitely think tapering can wreak some havoc as you are forcing yourself to go through the rough early stages of withdrawal over and over again, while not starting to feel any of the benefits.

I was depressed while I was smoking every day. It was really hard when I quit because I didn't know how to deal with emotions while sober, everything kind of hits you full force and its overwhelming. But I promise you it gets easier. In general the first two weeks are the hardest and you should start feeling better after that. I would aim to be sober at least 1 month to see how you feel then.

Everyone is different, and for me I'd describe the first several months as a rollercoaster - the good days were really good, but the bad days were really bad. But slowly the good days outnumbered the bad, and bad days turned from being depressed in bed to feeling ""meh"". By the 6 month mark I felt SIGNIFICANTLY better, though there were many improvements way before that.

It might feel like a long time and hard to imagine that far ahead, I do not want to be discouraging. Yes its hard in the beginning, but it is so worth it if you hang in there. *""you didn't make it this far to only make it this far""*

I used to have some problems with it. I would drink too often, drink alone, and drink way too much.  
Now, I don't like to drink, I don't like the taste or the way it makes me feel, but if I start I want to drink more and more and more. So in that way its still a problem for me.

I've only drank once, socially, since quitting weed almost 8 months ago. I think the only reason I didn't too much was because there wasn't much available. 

I've been looking at quitting as my sobriety from *weed*, so I never felt like I ""broke my streak"". I think if you can use it responsibly its okay to do it socially now and then. But be wary of if feeling intoxicated will make you crave the feelings of being high, or if being hungover will make you want to smoke weed. If you drink and feel ""this was a mistake"", you can carry on forward without putting yourself in that situation again.

A tip I have found helpful is to not turn on the lights in your house, and let it get dark naturally as it gets dark outside. It will help your body realize its time to sleep. 

Not sure if you've already tried but if possible avoid using the computer or phone within an hour of when you want to sleep (challenging, I know). If you MUST use them make sure you have a yellow light filter (I think most computers come built in with one called ""night light"" or ""night mode"".)

I think no matter what you do it will be difficult the first few days, and after that everyone has those nights once in a while where sleep is hard.

I found it helped to put it off (constantly) by telling myself something like ""I can pick up weed in an hour"" or ""I can pick up weed tomorrow"". And a lot of the time the craving would pass by then, I would realize that I *can* do this, and if I was still craving just put it off again. I found telling myself I could smoke later made the craving less intense, even when I knew in the back of my mind I wanted to stay sober. (might not be good advice for everyone, I apologize, it helped for me). Its really hard in the beginning, but I promise you it gets easier and its worth it.

Something that helped me get through the first few weeks was adding another small detail onto a drawing at the end of every day that I didn't smoke. Once the picture started to take shape I didn't want to leave it unfinished. It also felt like a little reward for myself at the end of a successful sober day. 

Finally here are some quotes that I like to tell myself to keep motivated:  
*The urge to smoke will pass whether you give in to it or not*  
*Be stronger than your strongest excuse*  
*You didn't make it this far to only make it this far*

Congrats for your 6 sober days! You know you have the willpower to do it, and it sounds like you will have a great support system with your SO. Hope some of this was helpful"

Assuming you'd be interviewing with the company first, you should ask them questions about safety precautions in place to help protect you when dealing with things like bodily fluids. Since interviews are also for you to see if the company is a good fit for you, if you are happy with the answers it should lessen some of your worry. Or if you are very unhappy with the answers it might be an easier decision to not make the change."
dogs,fcij0h0,t3_ehdfnv,1577663350.0,"My adopted senior dog had terrible leash manners and I trained him to loose leash walk by using treats. 

I'd hold a treat at my side so he had to walk beside me to get the treat. I started giving treats nearly constantly, like every 10 seconds. If he did start to get infront of me I would say ""ah-ah"" and stop and then back up and call him back towards me, use a treat to get him back in position beside me, and then proceed forward.

It took a lot of work (especially because my dog had years of bad habits). Eventually as soon as I would stop he would circle back around beside me without needing commanding. And now I can just say ""ah-ah"" and he slows down back beside me.

I very very slowly reduced the frequency of the treats and always give him lots of verbal praise when walking beside me. He gets 0-5 treats for the entire walk now.

I also worked on teaching him the ""look"" command at home. I mainly use it if he is getting distracted by another dog/ squirrel and starts increasing his speed. I say ""look"" and he will focus back on me which keeps him by my side.

I found walking slower helped for my dog so he didn't feel rushed to run and sniff everything, he can take his time and sniff. But I have heard other dogs walking at a faster pace is easier for them. You could also look into something like a doggy backpack to tire her out faster (wanting to run could be because of some pent up energy?) or some types of harnesses like one that attaches in the front - it makes it harder to pull because when they pull it sort of raises their legs up.

Whatever you end up doing, being very consistent and patient! Good luck!"
leaves,fcge6ql,t3_eh80sh,1577639063.0,"> Im afraid of what else may lay hidden inside me, unseen and forgotten and covered by thick smoke.

I think that's a very important sentence. Smoking weed can hide issues and prevent us from dealing with them. When we quit all those issues hit us full force and it can be overwhelming and easy to think ""I'm better off smoking"", but in the long run its better to find a way to deal with the underlying issues instead of smoking to ignore/ escape them.

You mentioned not being into therapy and I think that's fine. Maybe it would be a good idea to look into online anger management techniques. No need to bring up your past, just focus on how you control your emotions in the present. Several years ago I had a very stressful year and I was constantly angry and taking it out on those around me, including my poor dog, as well as potentially dangerous road rage. It did take a while but realizing how I was reacting poorly and making more efforts to not let everything push me over the edge really helped.

Also I am not sure how far you are into quitting currently, but being irritable and angry is common in the first few weeks. It may taper off as you go longer without."

Just like feeling a block and as if I had to lift 600lbs every time I wanted to do *anything*. I think part of that was depression, and even those feelings have gradually lessened since quitting. 

Also I really like the idea of looking at it as ""more days sober than high during x time"". I quit several months ago and this is the longest I've been sober in one calendar year since I was fucking 15! I feel so ridiculous to think of it like that. Why did I do this to myself?

I've heard it can take 2 months on average to form new habits, so I assume that can also apply to forming new daily habits that don't include smoking.

Have you started to feel any benefits yet? Hopefully soon you will start to enjoy music more as well as other activities you used to do while smoking. 2 weeks is an amazing accomplishment! I'm sure you've heard the saying you will *always* be an addict. And even though there will always be really hard times, I can tell you that overall it does get easier to deal with."

You said she was running circles around you when you got home, was she putting weight on it then?

I understand why you feel bad, but dogs are very forgiving. Mistakes like that happen, especially with smaller dogs and if you are not used to having one around. You took her to the vet as soon as possible, with your own money. You're taking good care of her."
dogs,fc68hwx,t1_fc67nv9,1577474708.0,"Well they didn't know for sure right away, but they based on it how he was displaying typical signs for an injury in that area and the physical assessment - they felt around his knee to see if there was more movement in that area than normal. Its hard to do on an awake dog in pain, but they said that's what it felt like. They sent me home with pain meds and said to keep him resting as much as possible for a week to see if it improved. It did not improve at all, so he went back in for x-rays and then they confirmed it for sure (he tore a knee ligament/ ""CCL"").

Since this isn't your dog I'd say you DEFINITELY made the right call taking her to the vet. If you were watching my dog I'd be so thankful that you got her checked out instead of just waiting to see. Keep an eye on her foot and it sounds like she is in good hands!"

Last year my dog injured his leg and wasn't putting any weight on it. I was able to get him into our regular vet within the hour, and it turned out to be something pretty serious that required a lot of recovery and care.

I wouldn't wake up as often but when I awoke in the morning I would feel exhausted - as if I had just been going on adventures all night instead of sleeping. It did improve and settle down at some point, though I don't remember a timeline I could give you.

I might suggest writing the dreams down. I find this helps me to sort of ""get it out of my head"". 

You could also look into dream interpretation as well. I think its more for fun than something really accurate, but you can find meanings that make sense for why this is a recurring thought during sleep. From my quick google search waves seem to represent emotions. If you were smoking for reasons of coping and escaping (like a lot of us), I think it makes sense with quitting that ideas of ""running away from your emotions"" could be on your mind.
