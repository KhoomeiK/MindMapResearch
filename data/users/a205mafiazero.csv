SweatyPalms,ffexgdh,t1_ffevmm9,1579869402.0,You’re exactly right!
enduro,ffed1oo,t1_ffe9eha,1579843596.0,Thanks!!
enduro,ffe96sj,t1_ffe7y46,1579840155.0,Thank you so much for the help! I just didn’t know if I’d need to adjust nitro pressure or oil levels in the back. This just made my day. Thanks again!
enduro,ffe4m6a,t1_ffdvo8d,1579836564.0,"Can I just pop a new spring on without doing a revalve? I thought that would mess up the shock itself. If I can, I’ll order one now lol"
enduro,ffdsx3p,t1_ffdlvpz,1579828116.0,Thanks! I’m trying to drop 60lbs total. I’m down 10 so far 3 weeks in. Also for this sport. Already feel better. I guess I’m gonna get this bad boy serviced and hope my wife doesn’t shoot me over the cost.
SweatyPalms,ffdmpxd,t3_estmlx,1579824167.0,"As a motorcyclist, I can’t stand people like this. Just find a parking deck or something. Gives all of us a bad rep when you run all the lights and wheelie by cars."
supermoto,ffbzf3d,t1_ffb6cmk,1579787544.0,Those DRZ’s are awesome bikes! I had one for a little while and I loved it. I had so much fun on that bike. Made the mistake of going to a full on sport bike for about a year. I couldn’t stand it so I sold it and bought the Husky.
germanshepherds,ffa0xf2,t3_esf1kb,1579725660.0,"Mine does this too! She’s like “what, are you gonna chase me?” Then it becomes a game of “RUBY COME BACK” and she’s just like “nah I’m out” then we run around the yard until I feel like I’m going to perish, and she calmly walks up like “did you want me to come here?” 

I freaking love my dog"
supermoto,ffa0fgr,t3_esecbn,1579725367.0,"Sick. I suck at wheelies. My husky 701 has the power, I just need to grow the balls haha"
germanshepherds,fepaxa1,t3_eq6sw0,1579316096.0,I am also in love with your new pup. Congrats!
Dirtbikes,fekjniz,t1_fekhqez,1579201438.0,Oh yeah it’s gonna hurt haha. That would be so sick to put a track kit on there!! I have always wanted to ride in the snow
Dirtbikes,fekh9ir,t1_fekh0g6,1579200010.0,"I’m usually not off long, because I live in the south. That being said it’s been a month of straight rain here and I haven’t ridden at all, and I’m nervous about racing again in February haha"
Dirtbikes,fekgrf4,t3_epjckv,1579199714.0,Do you find it hard to get back in the swing after a long time off?
WTF,fek9alo,t3_ephzcr,1579195282.0,I want to pet it
WeightLossAdvice,feig9zu,t3_ep9i63,1579137837.0,"Good luck on your journey! No matter how hard it gets, remember it is worth it. As every pound falls off, you will fee better and be one step closer to your goal! 

Also remember: You can do this. We believe in you, and heck if not everyone does, I believe in you! 

You sound like you’re truly committed to this change. I would highly recommend MyFitnessPal as a daily log for all calories. They have almost every food you can think of. I would also recommend walking, and a huge one that helped me was cycling!! It’s low impact on the joints, and is fun to explore places on the bicycle. 

Stay strong and remember, you can do this. If you slip up one meal or even a whole day, don’t beat yourself up. Knock the dust off the next morning and get back at it. You got this!"
germanshepherds,fehgn0k,t3_ep3rmy,1579116137.0,Such a gorgeous pup!
germanshepherds,fehgar8,t3_ep4yw0,1579115939.0,So glad to hear she’s with a loving home! What a sweet looking girl!
germanshepherds,fecde4u,t1_febai78,1578971274.0,Thanks! My wife got the from amazon. There is no tag on them to tell the brand. I’m sorry!
germanshepherds,fecdaiq,t3_eo5zjg,1578971214.0,Thanks!! I bet yours is sweet too!
germanshepherds,fecd9lz,t3_eo5zjg,1578971199.0,Haha she is!
germanshepherds,fe9h6iz,t3_eo3m8s,1578937546.0,Ohhhh das a good shep!
germanshepherds,fe8uirp,t3_eo3m8s,1578931096.0,Kong makes awesome toys that you can put peanut butter or cheese in. They are very durable also. Our GSD loves them!
Dirtbikes,fdwwnju,t3_en8f33,1578763029.0,This looks incredible! Great job!
Dirtbikes,fdwgbmz,t3_en2nsa,1578758378.0,"If you’re cold, they’re cold. Bring them inside."
germanshepherds,fdropf4,t3_emuiya,1578687478.0,"I am so sorry to hear about Roman! We will keep you and your family in our prayers. Remember all the joy you got from him, but also remember all the joy you gave him! In time, there will be another shep out there especially for you and your family. We don’t find dogs, they find us. I hope you and your family find peace in this tough time."
aww,fdo2nbh,t1_fdo1784,1578597766.0,Thank you fren! Both lovely sights to see!
enduro,fdlf1w3,t1_fdkyp0r,1578522631.0,Thanks! I am going to add in some body weight squats and wall sits also! I’ve never been to r/loseit I’ll check that out also. Thanks!
aww,fdkhx3m,t1_fdkdzae,1578504209.0,Gotta keep the feeps safe fren!
enduro,fdkh3aw,t1_fdjywed,1578503739.0,"I definitely have got to eat better. The meal prep should fix that. I’m riding a 2019 250 RX now and have been very pleased with the bike. It’s now narrowed down to the rider, me, just being out of shape haha. It’s good to know there are pro riders that are above the 200lb mark. Most of the motocross guys I see are in such good shape and skinny as all hell. I figure it’s different workouts for them as opposed to woods/enduro riding."
enduro,fdkgtp4,t1_fdk5jgm,1578503577.0,Swimming is definitely a great workout! I need to look into which of the hotels have pools inside
enduro,fdkgq76,t1_fdkbhc4,1578503517.0,My problem on the running is my knees. Ripped the right one open to the bone in a dirt bike wreck when I was much younger. I also also get horrible shin splints due to the excess weight I have put on so fast. I used to run cross country in high school and that was the best shape I’ve ever been in. I miss running so much.
enduro,fdjwxad,t1_fdj695y,1578490123.0,"Thanks for sharing! I’m doing MyFitnessPal and added in road cycling for cardio. I also have a rowing machine I’ll be using at the house. My biggest issue is travel for work. My wife and I are starting meal prep this weekend, so I can take a cooler with the meals I need when I travel. Our series races start next month, and I am incredibly nervous about being this out of shape for the first race."
enduro,fdiu8qy,t3_elm9ou,1578451159.0,Edit: I’m 29. I’ll be 30 this month.

bikesgonewild,fcyu4yk,t1_fcxxcuq,1578087132.0,"Honestly where I am, it was just so pretentious. Everyone just comparing wallet size and never doing group rides. Nothing was organized. The “leadership” of the club is garbage. Long story short it put a bad enough taste in my mouth to go back to a husky supermoto and get rid of the Ducati all together. Again no hate to anyone that owns Ducati or loves it. This was just my experience. I’m sure most chapters of the Club are awesome."
supermoto,fcxux39,t3_ejg4k2,1578070798.0,That heel clicker! Sick man!
bikesgonewild,fcxtvkc,t3_ejg8tq,1578070379.0,"Not a Ducati fan after owning a 2018 monster for a bit. That being said, this bike is absolutely beautiful. I may actually still have a little love for the Ducati brand after seeing this. 

Note: it wasn’t the bike that turned me off of Ducati. It was the local Ducati club."
supermoto,fcs4arz,t3_eil2f4,1577911267.0,I have a 2018 also. I love it!
bmxracing,fcb1q6f,t3_eguzzt,1577581015.0,"Great editing. Great footage. Dope whip at 54sec. Didn’t like the music, but that was the only thing. Everything else was sick!"
germanshepherds,fc9romf,t3_egth92,1577557198.0,He’s ready for the slopes fren.
aww,fc98jun,t3_egrft4,1577548739.0,This is so awesome!
Motocross,fc977wy,t1_fc8xi2w,1577548139.0,Try squeezing some Mio into the unflavored one! Should help get the taste to a tolerable level
aww,fc7ryq0,t3_egcyu3,1577517097.0,Now that’s a handsome doggo if I’ve ever seen one!
