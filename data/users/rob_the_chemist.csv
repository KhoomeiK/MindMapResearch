bipolar2,ff4x3y2,t3_erjdeg,1579574541.0,"I use Daylio and eMoods. 

I like daylio because it’s pretty and easy to follow. I like eMoods because it tracks specific symptoms associated with the disorder.

I don’t like daylio because if I’m feeling more than one emotion at once it can be difficult to express due to the format. I think many people can counter this by customizing it to their needs.

I don’t like eMoods because it seems more symptom-focused than mood-focused. You also can’t customize things like you can with daylio. 

Hope this helps!"
dxm,ff4h2u7,t1_ff4fosx,1579563444.0,"I know the anesthetic qualities quite well lol. Most of the time I can’t feel my hands or face and when I eat or drink something it feels like I’m swallowing flavoured air. I’ve also had closed-eye visuals and some pretty mild auditory hallucinations.

I really like listening to classical music when I’m tripping, sometimes it’s so beautiful I think I might cry lol. But I also tend to spook pretty easily while I’m on it and get really lonely."

relationship_advice,feuev2y,t1_feuditz,1579385882.0,"You made the sign for yourself because you knew that it was a problem and cared enough to fix it. OP has brought up the issue multiple times but she apparently still doesn’t think it’s enough of a problem to do something about it, be it making a sign or whatever else. That’s the real issue here."

relationship_advice,fetf8ik,t3_eqkrkn,1579374847.0,"That’s nasty. Tell her how much it disgusts you and that if she doesn’t start making an effort to flush the fucking toilet you’re not going to stay with her. Just be straightforward. It’s not a big deal to try to remember to flush and if she won’t even put effort into that there will probably be a whole load of other, more serious issues she won’t put effort into in the future."

bipolar2,fepaat7,t3_eq40b3,1579315675.0,"I have a bad habit of shutting all my friends out when I’m in a depressive episode. My depressed logic is that I’m sad and no fun to talk to, so it’s better for everyone if I don’t talk to anyone. I’ll just bring them down with me."

bipolar,fehacor,t1_fef8qj1,1579112456.0,"There’s been research showing that each episode makes it more likely for another episode to occur (so the more manic episodes you have the more you will have, and the same for depression) so I think if bipolar is suspected a lot of psychiatrists will want to treat the symptoms as soon as possible."
bipolar,feh7q2b,t3_eox8em,1579110882.0,"How much are you taking? Personally I would never take zyprexa again unless it was direly needed to quel an acute manic episode. Then when I came down I would be off of it so fast. If it’s working for you, though, I agree that you should try to take it earlier. Good luck!"
bipolar,feh6irq,t3_eoxvoj,1579110174.0,Exercise! I know this sounds lame and cliche but I’ve found that exercise REALLY perks me up. Even if it’s something as simple as stretching while listening to music you enjoy. More vigorous exercise may tire you out. Best of luck!

bipolar,feek8wy,t1_feejnhe,1579035444.0,The problem is that it’s a university psychiatrist and there’s only one and I don’t think she has any assistant expect for the university students that work in the reception area of the wellness centre.
bipolar,feek43u,t1_feeikym,1579035367.0,"For some reason this seems scary to me, probably because I’ve already talked to her about the side effects and she seemed dismissive, but you’re probably absolutely right."
dxm,feeihew,t1_feeh7w5,1579034422.0,Yes! I have to concentrate really hard for a good minute or so at least before I can open my mouth again.

bipolar2,fe9qokw,t3_eo43te,1578940630.0,"I get really anxious about all of these things too! I also get really anxious that all my friends actually find me really annoying. That being said, I think there’s a difference between that and me getting paranoid that if I sleep “they’re going to get me” and that my doctor is actually trying to poison me with my meds lol. So I think the first is anxiety and the second is paranoia."
