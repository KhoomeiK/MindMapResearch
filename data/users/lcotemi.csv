Dating_a_widower,fgunuem,t3_f0etxt,1581125351.0,"Your W is very conflicted. He found you, he wants to be with you, but he is worried about how others perceive him, including his own child. 

He needs to be honest with his daughter. She is not only grieving her mom, but she’s learning from watching her dad how to be in a relationship. This is a lesson learned by watching, and by honestly from her dad. 
He needs to help her understand that he has a lot of love to give, and that he wants to be loved. He needs to help her understand that he is capable of being alone, but he chooses not to be. He needs to help her understand that dating you does not mean her mother means nothing to him anymore. 
That last line is a hard pill to swallow for those of us dating the W. But it’s the truth. You would not want to be forgotten, so we cannot expect our W to forget about her. It doesn’t mean he keeps her spousal memory alive and in your face. But he needs to keep the maternal memory alive, for his daughter. And you need to support that. 
Once he can be honest with his family and friends, he will be able to hang out with you. You might learn a different side of him then. Mystery is attractive. Right now, your relationship is a secret to his side of the world. Once they know, he might be different. Just a warning. Please do not excuse his behavior as “because she died”.  

So how to navigate this. Yikes. Well, you start by living your life, and accepting his calls, but drawing a line at being respected. Also, know where that line is for self respect. It’s so easy to put ourselves second because of his suffering. But his suffering has nothing to do with you and your relationship. So if you wouldn’t accept being a secret from a man who isn’t a W, ask yourself why you’re willing to be a secret now. 

You won’t be abandoning him, if you keep your distance, you’ll be setting healthy boundaries for yourself. Don’t get sucked into the drama he’s creating by keeping you discreet."

AskWomen,fgqki4c,t3_ezrc7z,1581025940.0,"Me. College roommates. She was always a bit quirky, but I loved that about her. PPD caused her to go off the deep end. I stick with her, even though she was off the hook. 
Things she did: got angry because I’d spend time with my sister instead of her. Get angry because I wouldn’t stop by her house on my way home from work. Her house was 15 minutes out of the way, then another 15 minutes to get back in my path. As it was, i had less than 2 hours to spend with my kids after I got home, but she wanted me to spend that time with her. 
She got mad because she planned her c-section knowing my schedule, for a time I couldn’t be there. She got mad because her kid got conjunctivitis, and wouldn’t believe me that that is pink eye and highly contagious, on Christmas, so I wouldn’t take my kids to her house. 
She got mad because I wanted to buy something, I don’t remember what, for her kid for his birthday, she didn’t want him to have it, so I didn’t get that. I got something else. When another friend got that thing she didn’t want her kid to have, for her kid, I mentioned that friend didn’t want her to have it. Apparently it was okay that someone else gave it to him. 
All during that time I was being harassed at work and my friends were being spammed via email. I complained to said friend, and she sympathized to me. It went on for moths and included my boss receiving emails saying I’m bored at my job. Someone used my work email to sign me up for job alerts. I could have been fired, but luckily the IT guy was a good friend, so he figured out that it was said friend who was doing all that! End of friendship for about ten years. 
I gave her another chance years later, and I ended up regretting it. At that time she was very needy, and I am a sucker. I didn’t need her, but she needed me, to the tune of me taking multiple days off work to be by her side while in the hospital, etc. she has no sisters, and her parents are very much “someone else will take care of you”. I got her a job when she was destitute, and then when I needed her-I needed a shop vac, that’s all, and she wouldn’t answer my calls and has yet to return my call. 
She responded via text, but not with any sort of help. And then via email, still with no help-but it was way too late by then-days, weeks. 

To this day she has not apologized, even though that’s all I’ve asked. Friendship over for good. 

She still texts me on my birthday, and when she’s thinking of me. I don’t even have her number in my phone anymore. I know it’s her because of the number though. I don’t respond. It doesn’t stop her."

My current employer advertised my position, and during my 9 hours of interviews, I found he created my position out of a dire need, because he wanted to grow his company, but did not know how. He had been trying, but was sinking very fast. 
We negotiated my salary and other compensation, we agreed, and he requested I sign a non-compete. I refused, explaining that I was bringing way more into the company than he currently had. The widgets he was selling were and still are available in several places. The knowledge I needed to sell these widgets is commonly available online, or from any competitor.

What I’ve found is that I can feed into their narcissism, as long as it’s not hurting me, and I have a job and a decent environment.

He came back to my door, sunglasses on (in the shade) and proceeds to talk with me. He had a trainee with him. 

I stopped him, and asked him to take his sunglasses off. He didn’t, and asked why. I told him i want to see his eyes. He got defensive, and dig his heels in. I asked him again, he said no. 

His trainee asked why that matters. I asked if they ever heard of the term “shady character”, they said yes. I explained that when you shade your eyes, it’s shady. A person who can’t show his eyes can’t necessarily be trusted. 

The salesman understood, and moved his sunglasses to the top of his head. 
That was much better, and we continued the conversation. 

I ended up using the company I had originally wanted, because he’s the only one who pointed out a trouble spot I had on my roof. When shady character called to follow up on his appointment, (impressive, he’s the only one I didn’t hire who called back) I told him I went with a different company. He asked why, and I told him that he didn’t tell me about the trouble spot. He argued with me! Seriously, argued. He said I didn’t mention it to him. How was I to know? I can’t see my roof, that’s why I needed to hire a roofer. 

I finally had to end the conversation by telling him kudos for the follow up, but just accept the feedback without arguing, it’s not going to win you the job. His response? “Don’t ever call me again”. Lol"

AskWomen,fg62onj,t3_ewy5by,1580550453.0,"We worked together. Our boss was an asshole, and gossip was rampant. It wasn’t busy enough for us, so bored us started talking. Apparently when a man and a woman talk more than a certain amount, in full view of others, they are having an affair. That’s what the gossipers decided. 
It wasn’t true. 

This went in for a few years til I stopped working there. I got divorced after that, so did he. We still talked, because, you know, friends. 

I started dating again. But I didn’t want to date him. I knew him too well, and he’s not a faithful man. Cheating is what ultimately ended my marriage and i wasn’t going to knowingly get involved with a cheater. That’s what ended his too. 

He doesn’t want to be friends. I realized the other day that we haven’t talked in several years. But if we happen to be in the same place at the same time, he either messages me saying I still look hot, or he whispers it in my ear as he intentionally passes by me. 

I really miss our intelligent conversations, seriously.

Any gifts that were brought were refused.

It reminds me of the memorial tattoos. Luckily my hubs isn’t a tattoo guy. But her son is. He got his mom’s first name tattooed across his back. He didn’t consult his wife. The letters are 4” tall. He’s a big guy, so it’s proportionate. But his wife hates it. Why? Because he didn’t have “mom” put on his body. He wrote her name. So now, when people see him with his shirt off, the questions start of who that is, thinking it’s an ex love.

I was your sister. My sister had a child, and almost died carrying and giving birth. We all thought there was no way she’d have another. But when that child was 8 years old, I announced I was pregnant with my second child. My oldest was not quite 2. A definite plan. 

Shortly after that, both my sister and my husband’s sister announced their pregnancies. I felt very...unspecial. It wasn’t really anything new, this feeling. But I was hoping that, for once, I’d actually have something no one else had. My balloon was burst very hard, twice-because my sister announced that she was pregnant too! 

Time goes on. I had a girl, they both had boys. But my sister had twins. Thunder gone again. 

To make things worse, my SIL has her son on my son’s 3rd birthday. The twins were born a week later. 

Time goes on. None of that ended up mattering at all. We are all individuals, raising our kids the way we want to. And loving that you can never have too many people love your child.
