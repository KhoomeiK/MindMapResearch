depression,fbyy335,t3_ef4c8i,1577229486.0,"My mom wants me to be normal because I was fucking diagnosed with depression at the age of 11. It’s been a few years since then, and I’m still suffering from depression. My councilor has missed sessions with me quite a few times. She hasn’t been coming to sessions for over 3 weeks.. I just want to be better because it’s just miserable. I’m always crying and questioning why I’m alive. I also hyperventilate when I cry, and it’s really stressful.. 😭"
depression,fbyxtgd,t3_ef4960,1577229272.0,"My dad yelled at me even though I just asked what kind of cookies he’d want and I’ve been crying for the past 1/2 hour... I’m always just so empty and I’ve been feeling really suicidal these past few years. I don’t know why people always yell at me, I don’t know why I cry when people yell at me, even once my sister told me she hates me as a joke, but I went in my room.. and cried for over an hour and I eventually— when they left— went back in the living room, covered up with a blanket, and proceeded to sob. My brother walked in and asked me why I was crying, I said that I wasn’t, and that I was just sick. He told my mom. I don’t remember the rest."
