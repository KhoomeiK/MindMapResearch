That is flawed logic... there's no registry of radon levels that contractors submit data to. The government tests regions. You are correct though, the only way to know the levels in your specific house are to test the levels in your house. But the pre-test probability will vary based on where you live. 

I would also consider asking someone without a vested interest in the answer. You suggest asking radon testers about local levels. Do you think they'll give you an honest answer? They might, but conflicts of interest can be tricky because their answers can be skewed by the COI, even if they completely intend to be honest. It's like asking a barber if you need a haircut. 

I agree most people should test for radon, but in think it's problematic to argue with people here who have clearly researched the topic, know they live in low risk areas, and conclude against it."

""In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall review and, if appropriate, establish a policy directing all air carriers providing scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation to establish policies that enable a child, who is age 13 or under on the date an applicable flight is scheduled to occur, to be seated in a seat adjacent to the seat of an accompanying family member over the age of 13, to the maximum extent practicable and at no additional cost, except when assignment to an adjacent seat would require an upgrade to another cabin class.""

Airlines can't charge more except if it was an upgrade in class (ie comfort plus). Some of the comments about paying more for aisle seats is something I've never heard of in the US (I'm American), and I fly a lot. I certainly wouldn't expect someone to move from a comfort+ seat to a middle in economy, but otherwise, I don't think it's hard to move. And I see it happen all the time."
LifeProTips,ffz06cy,t1_ffytg84,1580359804.0,"There's no income cap to contribute to a 401k. There are limits to contributing pre-tax to a traditional IRA (tIRA). Those limits are based on income and whether you have an employer sponsored retirement plan. If you are above those limits, you can still contribute post-tax money to a tIRA. There is little reason to do this, except to facilitate a ""backdoor"" Roth. Contributing post-tax dollars to a tIRA that also has pre-tax dollars, and then keeping it there, just complicates things in retirement (the post-tax money is called your ""basis"" which can't be taxed twice). So when you pull money out of the tIRA in retirement, those withdrawals will be taxed based on the ratio of pre- and post-tax. Plus, as others have mentioned, it doesn't help you, cause it's no different than just investing that money in a standard (ie brokerage) account. 

But this is perfect for a ""back door"" Roth IRA (rIRA)

The thing is that anyone, regardless of income, can convert tIRA money to rIRA. The catch is that you have to pay the tax. But if you've already paid tax on the money being converted, then the conversion is free. This is already a long post, but you have to make sure you don't fall prey to the pro rata rule, but otherwise the process is straight forward. So basically, this is a perfect example of the odds stacked towards rich people. You make too much to contribute pre-tax to a tIRA? Great! Here's a loophole to contribute to a rIRA!"
