Re: population. Once a nation reaches a certain size, it matters less than you think. US had less than 25% of China's population for a long time. Quality of a country's population matters a lot. A poor, restless, large population is a burden on the state, which it must police, pacify and provide for. And on average, Argentina's population is much better educated than Brazil's.

Lastly, climate change. Brazil is much larger, but the bulk of its territory is within 15 degrees latitude of the equator. A warmer globe will cause havoc for Brazil; the Amazon fires last year are only the beginning. Argentina should fare better given its southern latitude."

IRA/stock/indexing = low risk/low reward over a long period, esp. at today's high valuations.

Business = high risk/high reward. Great if you can swing it, but very risky and possibly very demotivating if you fail, of which there's a significant chance.

I propose a third route: invest in yourself. Increase your personal *human capital*. This could be through college with a solid plan towards working in a lucrative field. Or it could be courses/certifications/license that will give you a good return. On a good but not not uncommon salary in the \~80k range, it's pretty easy to save money. Roughly $30k *per year, rather than four.*

Even more importantly, money invested in growing and educating yourself is yours forever. You can't get scammed, government cant take it away, and you cant blow it everything in a week at Vegas, unlike with stocks or business. This will set you up for the long term, if you maintain your motivation, hard work, and savings rate. You can later start a business when you find a way to provide value (possibly during your career).

UCSD,fdlcdyz,t3_elpi3a,1578521020.0,"As announced at the final exam, the grade breakdown will be posted on Piazza early this week. I also announced that my deadline to submit grades is Tuesday. Asking about the course graded before the grade deadline is like me asking for your programming submission before the assignment deadline. However much the question is asked, however much you want know the information, however much I want to know the information, when the information is still unknown, there is no answer to the question. I'm not in the situation where I know the answer to your question and am withholding it from you.

Reading and responding to your question about the course grade breakdown before the information is known just causes the very information you seek to be delayed for everyone since I'm taking the time to respond to you instead of continuing with the analysis needed to determine the course grades. After being at the CSE 12 final exam until after 10pm on Friday night and after spending all day Saturday grading final exams until after 6pm, any questions about your course grades asked Saturday or Sunday show no consideration to me or to the course staff in allowing a day of rest or a reasonable amount of time to pass before expecting the course grade to be determined. You've waited more than 10 weeks to know your grade in this course. Can't you wait a few more days before demonstrating your impatience?

As the student replier indicated, your question is worthy of a professionalism deduction. Knowing the answer to your question benefits no one, not even you. Knowing now doesn't change your grade, and it doesn't provide insights into the course content. Specifically, your question is an example of interactions to avoid such as ""asking questions where the information will eventually be known.""

At the beginning of the course, we awarded you 100% for the professionalism portion of your course grade assuming that all interactions would be professional. Your interaction above indicates that our initial prediction of your professionalism was incorrect. I've made an adjustment in your score to reflect the error in our assumptions.

If you'd like to explain how your question above demonstrates consideration, patience, and professionalism, please let me know."
