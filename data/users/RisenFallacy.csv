virtualreality,fcvl6t6,t3_ej269b,1578004468.0,It’s gunna be a while dude. Everything out is brand new as of 2019. I think the Vive came out in 2016. So I’d expect another 2-4 years before another generation comes out.
beatsaber,fcvkodm,t1_fcuvsc6,1578004150.0,Nah their issue is usually not setting up the boundary with a gap inbetween the boundary and the solid object. The other common trait is not putting the monitor at the back of your play space. Which room setup on steam does automatically.
beatsaber,fcu6i8j,t3_eiu48p,1577973728.0,Have both. Never happened cuz it’s easily preventable.

PublicFreakout,fcs8zmd,t3_eihhde,1577913147.0,"They are all lucky to be alive in my opinion. They totally outnumbered and overpowered those cops. Totally justified if one of them got shot for it at one point.

These are REALLY patient cops who put their lives in danger here by not being aggressive enough. There were many moments they could have been stabbed or shot without even being able to see it coming. AND THESE PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING THEM. Totally chill cops"
im14andthisisdeep,fcryi7a,t3_eifih2,1577908387.0,"LMFAO BULLSHIT. More like be what everyone deems you should be. Because if your not a part of this brainwashed crowd you’re gunna get downvoted and banned by ego fragile mods

MaliciousCompliance,fcry627,t3_eid181,1577908234.0,I don’t know how you all survive with data caps. I’d lose my mind in boredom and stress from monitoring my usage.
AnimalsBeingJerks,fcrx8ro,t1_fcqsp66,1577907874.0,"Just gunna jump in here and say I take my cat to the library here in the USA. Librarians love her, and she doesn’t leave my shoulder."
todayilearned,fcr6cvi,t1_fcpl3w7,1577897436.0,"elton john said i’ll help u thru ur addiction come on over. and then proceeded to tell him how offensive eminem’s songs are to the lgbt community and asked him to change them so eminem changed the lyrics shortly afterwards. A verse used to go “raping lesbians while they’re screaming let’s still be friends” 

That version of the song is BANNED now. All thanks to Elton John and Eminem being a sell out."
todayilearned,fcr5zbg,t1_fcpynch,1577897273.0,I think you should read up on your facts
todayilearned,fcpkg5c,t3_eib48n,1577866305.0,"And is why we must now hear censored versions of all his good songs. Fine to say raping women but “raping lesbians” oh that’s just unacceptable. I lost a lost of respect for Em back when I learned that shit. Idc how thankful he is, that’s just selling out against everything he rapped about."
Steam,fcnktef,t1_fcnabys,1577813474.0,"As long as you black out the white portions of the code, you are fine. Just make sure you do more than 1 or 2 digits worth if you are worried about them manually putting in the missing digit."
xboxone,fcnkkyi,t1_fcn9y10,1577813367.0,Nah this was just those soft peel off sticker things. Definitely not a screen protector.
