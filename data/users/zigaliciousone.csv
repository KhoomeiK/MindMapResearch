Reno,fel8lqi,t3_ep49zq,1579216421.0,"From what I've experienced, only unskilled labor are local and even then, a lot of them are contractors that don't even work for Tesla but a third party company. Some of those I view as predatory because they get a kick back for every employee on their roster, which incentivizes them to not convert you at the end of your 90 days. I know a few people who have contracted with them for 6 months or more because something in the background check goes wrong and they have to restart their 90 days over and over again.

  Almost every other job that requires a degree or some kind of technical experience as well as most supervisor positions are held by a transplant.

  So what ended up happening is Tesla brought more people to the area, which ended up driving up housing costs. 

  It's not exactly Tesla's fault that they require skilled labor that was not needed before and had to outsource jobs because of that but it is what it is. It would be nice if they used their muscle to positively influence our housing situation but it's not really their responsibility.

  One positive thing I have noticed though is the local labor market has to compete with the wage, so many other similar manual labor jobs have increased their pay. It just sucks that anyone now that rents a property charges at a minimum about 50% of a Tesla employees wage. Which probably affects casino, food and retail workers the most.  You know it's bad when motels that were once used for tourists now house our working poor."

The VC were a strong foe mainly because of their numbers and the fact that they didn't really mind sacrificing their people for the ""greater good"". Their losses in Vietnam were pretty ridiculous because they did not have the tech or skill of their opponents.

  If the size of the two armies is roughly equal, I think the win goes for whomever owns the home turf.  Ewoks live in a temperate forest while the VC live in a tropical jungle and the traps and strategies that work well in one would not win in another.

  Put them on neutral ground though and id give it to the Ewoks. They are small and therefore hard to hit, but have the strength of an adult human, and have shown more skill, cunning and ingenuity than I think the VC are capable of."
