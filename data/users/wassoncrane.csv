facepalm,ffj13ft,t1_ffj0s5h,1579987733.0,Every one of your comments. Theres a difference between being critical of unrealistic “fat acceptance” people and just being a dick about people with confidence issues. You seem incredibly childish

Science is constantly evolving. We could absolutely discover something tomorrow which completely rewrites our current understanding of physics. As we delve deeper and deeper into an understanding of the quantum world, we find that more and more things we were sure of before are just wrong now."
badwomensanatomy,ffizer3,t1_ffix8vr,1579986505.0,As far as we currently know. I’m sure back in the day people were saying “what dumbass thought we couldn’t breathe at 30 mph. Little did they know about the great speed limit the speed of sound”
JusticeServed,ffiblmi,t1_ffib77p,1579969987.0,They get a crooked doctor to lie that the accident caused back pain. How do you think ambulance chasers work in the us???
HealthInsurance,ffhjnfe,t1_ffgida7,1579938297.0,Grievances do basically nothing. Typically they look at the total amount of grievances when renewing provider contracts but that rarely happens and even when it does OPs would just be a drop in the bucket. It’s much much more effective to complain through the providers offices chain of command.
HealthInsurance,ffhjbyj,t3_etkp0u,1579937863.0,Get the code for the device from your doctor and call your insurance carrier.You should be able to request the medical policy they use to determine medical necessity which would go over the specific criteria you have to meet.
rva,ffhj0um,t1_ffhf8bp,1579937456.0,Please check with your insurance carrier first. Lots of plans do not cover vaccines done by pharmacists.
rva,ffhimc4,t1_ffh5fkr,1579936924.0,"Where the hell are you going to keep enough chickens to provide eggs for an entire school on an urban campus???? And who is going to be taking care of this horde of chickens? Janitors? Teachers? The schools in Richmond are already literally falling apart from lack of funding, they can’t afford farmers too. At least try to be realistic"

rva,ff6tprg,t1_ff6e207,1579634682.0,"So when the government does things you dislike, you openly support terrorism? Just trying to ensure I’m understanding you correctly. Your comment sounds like it advocates for violence in response to your party being in the minority. 

Also, Thomas Jefferson supporting something definitely doesn’t make it right. He was a slave owner, his economic policies tanked the US economy, and he attempted to censor anyone critical of him or the government.


here’s an interesting question for you. Would you also support armed leftist protestors saying “the final box is the ammo box” in response to an anti abortion bill?"
