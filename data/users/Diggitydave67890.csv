Its not a problem with the country or the cost of guns.  They have some older anti depressants that are generic and cheap even without insurance (like Celexa which is 4 dollars).

Is it a mental illness or not? If it is, then may I ask why we don't encourage schizophrenics to listen to the voices they hear? 

The pain is in the resistance right? A schizophrenic is in a constant pain because of the conflict between the very audible and visual things they see/hear and the reality. Are their conclusive studies that show the suicide rate of transgenders goes down when they just go along with how they feel? 

I just feel that in this case actual science has taken a back seat to politics and the opportunity for politics to sieze upon a voting block however small it may be.  
Can we say with a straight face that a 9 year old (as shown in the Democrat town hall) can be transgender? Is the science that settled?"

#2. The tuition is raised every year like the cost of everything else.  A Ford F150 wasn't 45000 dollars 20 years ago.

#3. Pay the loan back.  There are also deferments, forbearances etc.  

#4. Some textbooks are worthless but many can at least be sold back. 

#5. Degrees don't offer job placement? It's technically not the colleges responsibility to place you.  You do have to do some things for yourself. 

#6. The actual problem is that nobody explains to children that life is just not fair sometimes and there's just nothing you can do to fix certain situations.  The idea that is being taught to everyone is that everyone should have the opportunity to do anything they want and if they don't then there's some systematic problem that needs to be fixed.  Sometimes life is just shitty and some people don't get to go to college.  Some people just don't get to have a heart that works, or good mental health or enough money to buy a car or a large screen TV. 

Some parents need to be just blatantly honest and say ""look we don't have the money for college for you and if you take a loan, you need to pay it back.  There is no guarantee you will get a job where you can afford to pay it back and this is a big risk.""

Show them the default statistics, the current wages of what they want to do.  Educate the hell out of them.
