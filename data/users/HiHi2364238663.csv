To peak out from blankies these,
It be for that furry monkey,
And all his furry fleas."

AskReddit,fdj1ptf,t1_fdizbaa,1578456180.0,"I should have been more clear, and you're right to point this out. My intention was to draw attention to those narcotic drugs that maintain a non-generic status via loopholes in the orphan drug protocols - basically, they're too costly for insurance companies to cover (sticking those in need of it with the bill), but they're equally as coveted by the black market (which is always looking for the next fentanyl). When orchestrated correctly, those who hold pharmaceutical patents on cancer-grade narcotics get to cash out, regardless of who pays (or dies) because of them.

As a post-script, please inform me if I'm confusing or misinterpreting the facts. I'm always open to more education and better understanding of these issues."

Quick illustrating story: My mom is a big art collector, and I get to go a lot of gallery openings with her and her friends.
