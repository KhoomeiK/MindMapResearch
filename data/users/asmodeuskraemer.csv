So my house was built in 1968, one of those standard single family ranch houses. The owners before it replaced all the windows on the top floor with vinyl ones from home depot. Nice! 

I notice that the brick moulding on the outside of a couple of them is rotting. Shit. So I get some quotes to see what it would cost vs me doing it myself. One company told me the window was one whole piece-all the interior and exterior moulding, etc. He kept insisting that this was the case and was the only way the window could be fixed. Because they couldn't just take off the old moulding and put new stuff on cause it was ONE WHOLE PIECE. Wtf? Very, very clearly the window is new and the moulding is old and failing, as things do. He didn't have an answer and came back with a quote for $3800 for 3 windows.
