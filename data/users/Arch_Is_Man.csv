This is precisely the reason academics will always find themselves intellectually rich but financially poor whereas corporate buffs would be the opposite. Makes lesser sense with time.

Creating pie charts is evidently much more valuable than developing new algorithms, so originality is ironically discouraged. *Sigh*"

Only if Mello hadn’t gotten over his jealousy and reluctance to help his competitor, Light would have won quite effortlessly. Near got the advantage of Mello helping him by kidnapping Takada. If Mello had even decided to go on his own in this Kira mission, without cooperating with Near, none of them would have been able to defeat Light so soon."

nihilism,fcvfna7,t1_fcve53n,1578001094.0,"Wow, you possess a great amount of insight into life. True, money is the easiest solution to problems like these and a financially stable individual can effortlessly cease to think about the dark side of humanity and the global condition. The way you put it, I guess it takes the less privileged a lot of energy to even wake up the next day and keep living. Truly, it is unfortunate that, after so many centuries since the first humans were evolved, we haven’t resolved these problems. In fact, the people who can most easily accept the grim reality as it is are those who are a part of it and have no feasible way to get out of it. The rich live in a bubble far away and detached from the real world that seems to be withering away. Hope I can one day be a part of that lucky group and donate to alleviate the pain and suffering of the underprivileged by some extent, instead of being another archetypal selfish, rich prick. If the more privileged can’t help the less privileged and make the world a better place to live in, who will? Well, anyway, I feel sorrowful for the condition people like you are in."

nihilism,fcvb1ig,t1_fcv9ov0,1577998356.0,"I apologize if my previous statements have offended you in any manner. I also sympathize with your condition and realize it is only expected of someone in your situation to feel so depressed and frustrated with life. I was unaware of the basis of your opinions and wrongly believed them to be examples of puerile behavior. All I can do is to provide you with the much-needed solace in times like these which, too, would be futile given that I’m only another stranger and that you’ve actually searched for solutions over several decades. My deepest condolences at your miserable situation. Accepting reality as it is to an individual is certainly an arduous task and one that can disillusion many. That you’ve been able to do this yet subsequently committed deeds of charity is highly laudable. I wish your situation becomes relatively better in future. Again, I’m sorry."
nihilism,fcv67ps,t1_fcv198n,1577995483.0,">	Yes, it’s a world run by psychopaths, filled with pain, ignorance, poverty, disease, slavery and war.

You apparently possess a highly negative outlook on the world and life in general. If you believe this is what the world is, why continue living? Either do something about it or cease to exist to stop having to withstand all the pain. It is only logical to try and find a solution to a problem and, in this case, the most viable albeit unreasonable one would be to stop living, especially as a single individual like you or me can do little to change the world you describe. Depression is a result of harboring such opinions about the world but it isn’t a solution. Happiness is only a momentary escape from all things bad, according to you. But, none of this would arise if one ceased to exist, right? The version of the world we create in our minds is atleast somewhat different from what the world actually is and affects how we live here. So, it’s rational to either create a version similar to yours and find a solution to said problem or completely change how one perceives the world that creates no dilemma, because living in chronic depression and dying depressed without doing anything about it is absurd. It’s like leaving a disease untreated, a disease that might not cause death instantly but slowly gnaws at the fabric of the mind until it gets damaged beyond repair. And problems that have no *reasonable* solution like this one should not be sheltered, in my opinion."
deathnote,fctqfg2,t1_fcsx9pp,1577954182.0,"This. Light actually got defeated because of Teru and that’s totally unacceptable. Near has little credit in managing to defeat Kira... L would have made a much better adversary. Wish I’d gotten to see the perfect world Light has planned to create, would have been amused by it. Guess a genius and mastermind like Light just didn’t fit in with the messed up world."
deathnote,fctq5ye,t1_fcthl35,1577953817.0,"Strongly agree to this. Death Note Part 1 was heaven for someone who’d always craved for exactly this kind of stimulation. Yes, the fight with L was mind-bending, and that Light won against him had made me feel elated. But Part 2, well, lowered my spirits. The fact that “L’s successors” managed to defeat Light for a mistake Teru made just couldn’t please me. L was much more skilled than Near and Mello and it would have been still acceptable if L won against Light, but whatever. Guess I should have stopped watching after L got killed to keep my dopamine levels at an all-time high."
nihilism,fctocxq,t1_fctlvi8,1577951344.0,"The fact that the human mind, by default, craves for that abstruse state of mind called happiness cannot be refuted. What you might be talking about is pleasure, which is very superficial, but happiness is not pleasure. Very few people on this planet are actually happy, and the sources of happiness are what I was suggesting one should find, through self-discovery. The key goal in life is not predetermined but having happiness as the goal is only logical given the human tendency to mostly engage in activities that raise dopamine levels, and happiness does raise that by the highest margin, I believe. So, while being a nihilist is rational, as life has no meaning besides contributing to entropy, life is much more than survival, isn’t it? If one remains depressed throughout one’s life, I don’t see how that helps one survive in a better manner. After all, maintaining equilibrium is what all entities in a physical system usually aim for, and it only makes sense to run after the antidote to the psychological poison one ingests on a daily basis, that one thing which keeps one’s mind in a favorable state. P.S - You can PM me if you wish to continue this discourse."
depression,fctnmhz,t3_eikk9a,1577950374.0,"Life has no inherent purpose save for entropy. It evolved into this mess purely at random and might get wiped away sometime in the distant future. As an insignificant time interval in the grand scheme of things, life means little, but scaled down to the level of the individual, it should be spent in a way the individual deems fit. The purpose of one’s life is the purpose one creates, the purpose that makes one reluctant to die soon, the purpose that stands out from the rubble and ruin of times, the purpose that means something to oneself, something special. Figuring out that purpose is onerous, for sure, but it is that purpose that gives meaning to life, that which makes us truly happy. It could be as simple as building stuff that makes one’s life more comfortable or as complex as manipulating entire governments and organizations. Whatever it is, it should be something that one believes made one’s life meaningful for oneself and for others."
nihilism,fctl1w8,t1_fcsh3vn,1577947194.0,"Sure, believe what you want to and do what you want to. Let’s agree to disagree given that this argument is taking both of us nowhere. You may think you’re right, I may think I’m right but I do respect your perspective. Given these are abstract concepts we are arguing about, there might not be one right answer. All I meant was that embracing nihilism can make us do something good for us and others, instead of keeping us depressed 24/7. If life is truly meaningless, how does it hurt to do something for oneself and the society one lives in, something which makes everyone happy? But, whatever."
nihilism,fcsfaru,t1_fcsdo5j,1577915711.0,"Whoever said a pursuit for meaning has to be a journey around the world? In fact, that would not be very effective. I meant that one should go on a journey of self-discovery, to realize one’s true, unsullied self, the essential core of one’s psyche. That wouldn’t require much money, would it? Even if they can’t find that satisfactory a meaning, they’d have learnt something for sure. That would seldom be much of a status symbol. And if tricking one’s mind is what it takes, why not? What is and what we perceive or even choose to can always be disparate. There is no meaning in life, but at a personal level, will the absence of meaning do much to alleviate all that unwanted agony, as in the end, no human wants to dwell in pain of any form. Going on path of self-discovery, to find the proverbial inner voice is, I think, the foremost thing one should do. Human nature has not degraded so much that depression is something it is willing to settle with, there has to be something more interesting. And even if one assumes life is meaningless and no meaning can or should be created, why channelized that through the wrong vents, the vents of depression and anguish? Why not do /something/ to get into a relatively better condition, for as long as one’s alive?"

nihilism,fcsbq7o,t1_fcruy2o,1577914311.0,"AFAIK, Earth C-137. But, this question is out of context with the previous: answer it. Why should emotion make our judgments and thought processes fallible? One could a) choose to remain depressed, carry on with life in a happy-go-lucky manner and die hollow or b) go on a journey to derive, or better, create meaning from one’s life, work towards doing something useful besides contributing to entropy and die in a much better state of mind. The end result is identical in both cases, but the work done and, consequently, the happiness attained would be beneficial to both oneself and, hopefully, society. In the end, if we die after all, why not do something that makes the time interval between birth and death a time interval that mattered? Nihilism is a theory that can be studied from multiple perspectives; a nice one is that which changes you for the better, both for yourself and your environment. Again, life is meaningless unless we create meaning from it, meaning that makes us feel elated and inspired, not the opposite. Sure we are insignificant, but that will deter us from doing what we can? I hope not!"

People choose to believe what they want to believe and I choose to believe the aforesaid because it makes me feel contented. Respecting different perspectives is wise and the stance I take is, in my opinion, a nice one. Why remain depressed when there is no reason to? There is no one right answer to the message even a cartoon imparts as perspectives might vary and projecting a notion which, I believe, might urge one to live one’s life in a fruitful manner, so that, in the end, one dies with a smile on one’s face, feeling pleased with oneself and with the life one led."
nihilism,fcjbbzb,t1_fcj7rf7,1577682031.0,"Well, I gather the meme wants to show that searching outward for the meaning of life will only be in vain and give us nothing. Thus, nihilism comes into the picture. However, if we look inward, into ourselves, we might realize that meaning isn’t out there, but in us, created by us and varying from person to person. Nihilism is fine but optimistic nihilism (Google the phrase) is essentially nihilism minus the depression and other negative feelings associated with it. Why remain depressed by choice when it yields no measurable value? Stay happy and do what you love, you’ll automatically find meaning from the work you do and the people you help."
