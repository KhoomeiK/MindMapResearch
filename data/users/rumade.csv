I got 2 nights free accommodation in a tiny village in Okayama called Ushimado, then decided to come to Beppu because I'm not good with winter weather and the onsen looked warm.

I'm on the express to Hakata now. 2 nights in a hostel and then 4 in a hotel that's 100 yen a night with a live stream running constantly from your room.

Have never heard of the places you mentioned. Basically I turned up in Beppu, went to tourist information, and decided what I wanted to do day by day.

I would definitely give Beppu at least 2 days- the sand bath feels amazing, Kifune Castle is run by an eccentric guy who will do a ritual to ward off evil which involves touching a snake, there's so many beautiful onsen to visit, and I hiked out to a waterfall called Onbara Falls. Beppu Hells (Jigoku) are a bit of a tourist trap but I enjoyed them- it was my first time seeing a geyser.

With a car I would definitely recommend going to Usuki- it was a bit of a pain by public transport as it's a little out of the way. The site feels very spiritual and the Buddha statues are over 1000 years old. It's pretty special."

LearnJapanese,fdpwjbk,t1_fdpqz2n,1578643460.0,"I really like Lingodeer and have used it on and off since before it was a paid app. Everything that's on the tests should be within the lessons leading up to it so I'm not sure I understand what the struggle is with that. I liked it better on a tablet than on phone as everything fit better onto the screen.

My favourite part of Lingodeer is the option for audio repetition. When I work through a lesson and I'm on the pages with just the example sentence (right at the start), I listen once, play again and talk along with it as many times as I need to feel comfortable, then record myself and compare. It's fantastic for matching the native pattern and pitch of the sentences. 

The sentences are natural and applicable, there's no bullshit like Duolingo has you saying ""my dog sells flowers"". Every point I've learnt with Lingodeer has been relevant to my life. 

Every time a sentence is shown you can tap individual words to get a break down on the grammar being shown or a translation on nouns. To me the lessons feel challenging without being too hard.

If you're an actual beginner and are just trying to blaze through the lessons, stuff won't stick. Instead of spending 2 minutes on a lesson, spend more like 10 and repeatedly listen to the audio so it sticks in your memory.

One of couples they interviewed had been in this situation for 8 years and had a 3 year old daughter as well as a 10 year old son  (or similar, I can't remember the exact ages). I remember not only thinking ""wow that irresponsible"" but also ""so you live in a single room with your elder child and you're still having unprotected sex?"" Both contraception and terminations are widely available at no cost in the UK.

I got pregnant accidentally when I was 25 and chose to have a termination because the father made it clear he didn't want a child and I didn't want to bring up a child by myself in poverty. We were literally living in a van at the time. I can't imagine someone in that situation actively deciding to add a baby to the mix."

tumblr,fdj12w4,t3_eleqtb,1578455741.0,"I'm a woman and I do this all the time. I did when I lived in London, even though people kept telling me I was going to get attacked. I did it in Wales where the biggest risk was falling in a ditch. I do it here in Japan where there's a risk of stalkers.

Have I ever even felt unsafe?

Nope. Don't let yourself live in fear.

Night walks fucking rule."

Mine has a sturdy handle on top so when I'm on public transport or in a shop I can take it off and not be an inconvenience to anyone. It's excellent."
