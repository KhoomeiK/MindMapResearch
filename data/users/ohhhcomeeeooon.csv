DiWHY,ff8s1ec,t1_ff8rwof,1579693828.0,All they had to do is install normal hooks instead of spoons and forks. It would look ok then.
medical,fezi2qn,t1_feyw637,1579457597.0,That's exactly what it is. I have it too. It's harmless but annoying af.
me_irl,fen52hb,t1_femx8xp,1579277140.0,One of my favourites too.
AskReddit,femqpgc,t1_femdys4,1579266822.0,You kinda have to give us some details now.
howto,fejhlmg,t3_epevl5,1579174612.0,Believe it or not just yesterday I was googling tips on how to do it. Thank you so much for your post!

And many more."
DiagnoseMe,fegdqt8,t1_fegdn2p,1579089110.0,Nowhere near that! I was 24. I had to get a surgery after that to take some veins out. Now I probably should've mentioned that I have varicose veins on top of all that so that definitely was a part of the problem too.
medical,fegdhnh,t3_eoy8b7,1579088817.0,Oh maybe that illness has something to do with it. I can just guess because obviously I'm not a doctor but you should talk to your doctor about it or do your own research. There might be links between whatever illness you have and not getting colds.
DiagnoseMe,fegbcel,t3_eot6rw,1579086109.0,I want to say it could be. Don't want to scare you but I had DVT because I was on contraception and a smoker. I'd advise you to go to a doctor and ask for different form of contraception. Or quit smoking but I know that one's not as easy as switching contraception.
medical,feg9nrr,t3_eoy8b7,1579083757.0,Good for you. I have tonsilitis right now and it SUCKS. I used to never get sick so enjoy your amazing immune system for now 'cause it won't last forever.
AskReddit,fedzjom,t3_eoki7d,1579023194.0,Iggy Pop. Seriously like.
AskReddit,feb9hty,t1_fe9yjpn,1578956590.0,It happened in my school too. They never found the culprit.
unpopularopinion,fdxp3br,t3_en52cm,1578771404.0,Well I thought I was normal but apparently people think I'm weird so it checks out.
facepalm,fdqnaxc,t1_fdqn6my,1578670700.0,Here it is https://www.google.com/amp/s/metro.co.uk/2019/08/19/woman-no-idea-pregnant-went-labor-triplets-10596831/amp/
facepalm,fdqn6my,t3_empilw,1578670626.0,Oh there was a story a few years back of a girl who went to a doctor with stomach pain and it turned out she was in labour. She had no idea she was pregnant.
funny,fdo9jnc,t3_emdljs,1578601234.0,Fair play to them xD
AskReddit,fdlv2qt,t3_elu6v5,1578533182.0,"I'm 29 and I still watch cartoons. I have a tattoo sleeve with cartoon characters and regularly get called weird because of it. Don't care, I love my cartoons."
AskEurope,fdggcfp,t1_fcollba,1578395550.0,You're probably right but I personally haven't seen one person not looking like a carrot after they put that stuff on.

russiaoralabama,fdenzjq,t1_fdem8il,1578343027.0,Because they hit very hard.
unpopularopinion,fdbw0hy,t3_ekfm4v,1578262747.0,I still buy it in ireland so I'd assume ye probably have it in UK.
memes,fdbcmg9,t3_ekcm64,1578256038.0,Poland seems to be the only one that has it's city's name converted instead of the country's name.
medical,fd56ijz,t1_fd55qmj,1578174676.0,You're welcome. I hated that thing. My gynecologist says there's too much hormones in them so they may cause all sorts of abnormalities. They're just not for everyone I guess.
medical,fd54ziv,t3_ek2ucg,1578174198.0,"Yep, I'd be guessing it's the implant. I had the same problem when I had it only it lasted the whole 3 years."
AmItheAsshole,fd1qh4s,t3_ejn73n,1578135206.0,"Well water allergy is a thing but it only affects the skin so she's obviously full of s***. NTA. Your friends seem to be very ""sensitive ""."

AskEurope,fcorzcx,t3_ei6ro9,1577839958.0,"Absolutely. I'm polish living in Ireland. Without EU I wouldn't be where I am now in my life. Wouldn't have a good job, two cute af cats and the love of my life who I'm getting married to soon. It's certainly not perfect but it opened a lot of doors for me and I'm very grateful for that. Also happy new year, lovely people xx"

cursedimages,fca878h,t3_egrm3h,1577564533.0,That's a beautiful metaphor. A lot of us are drowning in the sludge that is jobs/lives we hate yet we still do it because we feel like there's no other way.

AnimalsBeingBros,fc4ndot,t3_eg0qm6,1577421863.0,A robin is person you lost that is trying to make a contact with you. It's superstitious but I like to think it's true as I lost my dad and a robin started hanging around my garden for about two months. It was weirdly comforting.

AskDocs,fbxj6ex,t3_eew7ld,1577190055.0,"Best thing to do I think is to tell the doc what you just told us and they'll know where to start. I also wish you good luck, I recently just managed to drag my mother to a doctor after 30 years of her ignoring a condition she has. It was not easy, their generation is stubborn af."
