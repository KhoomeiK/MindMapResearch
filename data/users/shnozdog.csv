A little over 100 years ago, horses were the primary mean of transportation. And thousands of years before that we used horses. It's only very recently that cars became how we got around. And that got me thinking about how quickly technology has progressed in such a short period of time. I look back at computers 20 years ago and I think they're primitive compared to what we have today. Imagine what another 20 years of advancement will be like."

Also my units would be stretched too thin so I'd have to build a bunch of those as well.

Australia, who hardly had any units, declared was on me. I think because I was about to win a science victory. I almost never go on the offensive during wars, but I've got this huge Navy.

I like that you have to think more strategically when planning cities. Is there a good spot for a campus? Where's the industrial zone going? You also had to prioritize what you wanted in each city, because you aren't going to be able to build everything in every city. Also the way strategic resources were changed up in GS. You can't just get one oil well and have a massive army of units that need oil. You, and the AI, are limited by how much oil you are getting per turn. Feels more realistic."
