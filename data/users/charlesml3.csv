He's afraid of a recording of the incident that HE cannot control.  If this goes sideways, he does not want any recording of it but his own.  That way, if it's *really* bad the camera could ""suffer a malfunction"" or the footage could be ""inadvertently deleted."""

And in that state, it has to be lofted into the air so it can be inhaled.  The problem with Asbestos fibers is the way they're ""barbed.""  The respiratory system cannot work them back out.  That's why the miners were getting sick.  Once it's mixed in with other materials it almost always becomes quite safe.  

It doesn't matter though.  The FUD has taken over and all the science in the world won't convince people of the reality."
todayilearned,fcnru4j,t1_fcn6h74,1577817227.0,"> Asbestos being carcinogenic is like the most tragic thing in materials science.

Well it's more like ""the fearmongering over Asbestos being carcinogenic.""  There are a lot of ""Asbestos abatement"" companies that are making millions over this fear.  They're charging customers thousands to remove asbestos linoleum floors even though that asbestos is completely encapsulated in plastic and of no danger whatsoever.  There are buildings sitting empty and abandoned because they ""tested positive for asbestos.""  It's nonsense.  Asbestos isn't radioactive.  You don't get cancer just because you got near it.  The fibers have to be lofted into the air and pulled into your lungs.

But it's too late now.  Everyone associates it with cancer and it'll likely never come back from that fear."

If you don't cooperate, they use what's called ""Plus 1""  In other words, they can ""one-up"" whatever you're doing to gain control.  

They are trained to believe their safety is paramount over everything else (including your life).  The well-being of their left pinky finger is more important than your life.  

All of this adds up to a police force that is constantly scared.  They're scared of everything.  You, your dog, your 70-year-old grandmother.  

The ""rules of engagement"" when it comes to lethal force are all but non-existent.  ""Felt threatened"" is all that's necessary.  If one of our armed forces pulled some shit like this on foreign soil against an enemy combatant, they'd be facing a court martial.
