Fat is no longer a status symbol like it was in like 1170 when you were a Feudal Lord in Europe and could afford to eat chicken and had all the food you could ever need. Back then, fat meant wealthy and powerful.

Fat is rightfully considered to be unattractive, because with what we as a people now know about obesity, we can confirm long-term health problems that occur as a result. Diabetes, heart disease, just to name two things.

In my mind the worst offenders are the ""hEalThY aT aNY SizE"" brainlets, less the body positivity people on the whole. If you're chunky, and you're comfortable with that, that's fine. But you shouldn't be obese and wondering why nobody wants to fuck you. You KNOW why they don't. I tried to post this topic like 4 months ago and it auto-censored me."

Food, soap, clean clothing (if they're roughly your size idk) with those you can at least have some guarantee that what you give them is of actual benefit and not just buying their next fix. Not to say that all homeless people are junkies, simply that many might turn to substance abuse to cope."
