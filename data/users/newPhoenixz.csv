>Do keep in mind that ""mass shootings"" lack a proper definition. And any event where 3+ people are shot is defined as a mass shooting.  
>  
>387 people died in the most liberal number. But yet 261  died in Detroit.

If your argument is low amounts of mass murder, need I remind you that most of the western world has that number next to 0 because of gun laws?

>Mass shootings aren't an issue. They're a bullshit taking point. 

Tell that to the families of dead students.

>90%+ of all mass shootings happen in gun free zones. Because surprise surprise, criminals don't want people shooting back. Again refer to the Texas church.

Do you really think that school shootings happen ""because they are gun free"" ? And that they would not happen if there'd be guns? I'll ignore that teacher with a gun that accidentally shot himself (because that is the obvious shit that happens when you force people who don't want guns to carry them) and I'll ignore the teachers always having to be on guard, not only for crazy murderers but also for the thousands of students running around them, bumping in to them, and maybe one could be taking their guns while they don't pay attention for a minute. 

I'll ignore all of those problems because you seem to believe that people actually stop committing crimes when there is a person with a gun near. If that were true (it isn't) then why do all these shootings happen with police officers? Why do people commit crimes at all if there is so much police? Contrary to that, in Holland we don't have gun violence. There is eventual exception that is so newsworthy that it makes headlines whereas in the US most shootings are just.. static, background noise, because it happens all the goddamn time. 

In the Netherlands we do have criminals, and they do have guns and they do fire them, yes. Mostly at their rivals. 99% of the shootings that do happen there are between very heavy and hardened criminals. The only mass shooting we had in the Netherlands was a guy who (surprise!) had easy access to guns because he was a member of a gun club and the police failed to do a background check on his mental state and the guy was schizophrenic. He never should have been allowed to have guns in the first place. Did the Dutch go in a full panic gun buying frenzy? Nope. We improved the laws prohibiting guns, made it even more strict. 

And lo and behold. How many gun deaths do we have in the Netherlands? How many in the US?

>Australia and New Zealand cannot be compared to America. They have no land borders, and would be much harder to smuggle weapons into.

And weapons are legally not allowed, mostly, and because of that, they have less gun violence. See? It's not that hard.

>A report from the CDC isn't enough for you? 

What CDC report? Last I heard CDC was silenced long time ago by the NRA, wouldn't want to have gun statistics out there so that people can make an informed decision on this...

>From an organization that has since been banned from looking into gun violence?

My point exactly.

> You're going to call bullshit on that while trying to compare the 3rd largest country with massive boarders to New Zealand. 

I'm not sure what I'm calling bullshit on

>A country maps find optional? How about you start backing up your claims for once instead of the same old taking points.

If you want backed up claims, then I'll give you a simple one. Places outside of the US with less guns have less gun deaths. Well actually nobody, not even mexico, has the shit you have going on, but a good reason for that is also the abysmal state of your (mental) health system in comparison to other countries. Mental illness doesn't mix with guns, yet that seems no issue in the US. Either way, less guns is less gun deaths. This goes world wide.

>Police? You fucking daft?

Do I really need to explain why police was invented? And please don't tell me you're one of those ""To supress the population!"" types, because then there is little I can do for you but to tell you to please look into medication.

>The new Zealand shooting took 15 minutes to kill 51 people. The Texas church shooting took a half minute at most for the shooter to drop dead only shooting one guy. It's an 8 minute drive for police to get to the mosque. Why did it take 15? What if that was a 30 minute drive instead?  
>  
>Police can't be everywhere at once. Especially in rural areas where people don't have neighbors to hear commotion. I know people who are 30 minutes away from police if anything happened. Should they just accept they they'll be raped and murdered?

Sure, let them have a gun if they have to. I would not think it a good idea if they have enough guns to sustain a small country, like some US citizens seem to feel the need to have, but in principle I don't have issues with private gun ownership. I do think there should be strict rules. No military grade guns, no ammunition that has even been banned by the geneva convention but hey, the streets of the US are fair game it seems. No guns for the mentally ill. Make ammo more expensive. 

But you can't do any of those things. Look even in the wrong way at guns and people start to whine about evil governments which is just insane.

>On top of that you ignore all my talking points on homemade firearms. If your going to have a conversation, at least argue in good faith, and don't grasp at straws.

You do understand that this is a huge wall of text? Do you need an apology if I failed to comment on something? Here, I'm sorry. Feel better now? 

Quick reply on home made firearms: Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Most people in most countries will not do this, even if they can because again, and I know this is hard, but most people do not think the way you think. THAT is the reason why guns availability is very limited in most parts of this world. NOT because governments want to control the people (actually, its usually the other way around in real democracies, maybe you want to get one of those?) but because THE PEOPLE DON'T WANT GUNS BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH THEM."

You have pirates in the US now? oh wait, that was hundreds of years ago. Piracy, if it happens now, gets dealt with by war ships using trained military, you know, the people you'd want for that job as you don't want to have to defend a 300 meter cargo ship manned by 10-20 people who never saw a gun in real life. 

>The only reason a country wants to disarm it's people, is so that it can abuse them. 

Yeah, and you don't know what you are talking about. literally. To take the Netherlands again, weapons are not allowed because \*the people\* don't want weapons around as they cause more trouble than they solve (see the US for any example you'd need on that). On top of that, the Netherland is more democratic than the US. There is no president, no two party system, just government chosen by its people who are actually educated and informed, unlike those in the US. And if you want to claim that the US population is informed, I'd use that phrase.. what was it again.. oh yeah, ""FAKE NEWS"", that your current illegit president loves so much.. You already have had two presidents that were not voted for. If you want to claim that the US population is educated... sigh.. People in the US \*can\* have the best education in the world, for sure.. Most though, don't get that. Do I really need to start talking about ""intelligent design in education"" here?

>Look at Venezuela, Hong Kong, etc. Hell, the 2nd amendment potentially helped the second world war end quicker. The 2nd prevented the Japanese from invading America as they knew the populous was armed.

Dear god, where do you get any of that from.. Hong Kong is a \*very\* complicated situation with a huge history that you need to know about before you can start mentioning that. And that Japan didn't invade the US because the populous was armed.. That is the level of ""debunked too many times to count"" dumb that I'm not going to dignify that with an answer. If you want to use that, show me an actual source that historians agree with. Hint, you won't, because it doesn't exist, because it never happened.

>Find me another place in the world that has a MASSIVE unguarded border with a country with a high murder count, large unguarded water boarders, a large population with a large rural percentage. You can't because there isn't another country with the same issues.

Well how about... drumroll... CANADA!  It has a MASSIVE unguarded border with a country with a high murder count, large unguarded water borders, a large population with a large rural percentage. Dear god, you really don't know about Canada? Its right above you! Buy a map! Here, [https://goo.gl/maps/pqiRvadT6mF71cm5A](https://goo.gl/maps/pqiRvadT6mF71cm5A) there it is!

A quick lookup shows that murder rates are

* Canada 1.8
* United States of America 5.30
* Mexico 24.80

That means that the US has roughly 300% the murders of Canada and Mexico has roughly 470% the murders of the US.. Quite honestly, If I was a Canadian, I'd be worried about illegal immigrants from the US.. 

>You can't.

Just did.

Funny, Mexico has similar numbers but actually even worse. 

>You know, CRIMINALS not following the law. 

Not entirely, the US government knowingly and willingly sent guns to criminals over here. Thanks for that!

>Because CRIMINALS are the ones killing, robbing, etc.

>How does a church shooting and a mosque shooting have nothing in common? It's someone going into a place to kill people in mass. Except guns made one much safer, and as such, much less deadly."
