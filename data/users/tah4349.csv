I had to restrain myself from throttling her at In and Out because she kept chiding my kid that she needed to eat all her food, make sure you eat your food, don't just drink the shake, you have to finish everything.  No.  She doesn't.  She's 9.  A cheeseburger, fries, and a shake are too much for her to finish.  We are here because it's a special occasion, and she can stop eating whenever her body tells her she's full.  There is absolutely no harm in a 9 year old not eating all her milkshake.  It's FINE."

In college I worked the 6-8 am shift at my dorm front desk, and it was perfect - get up, do homework, head to class.  But on the other end, if I'm awake past 9 or 9:30 pm, it's a miracle.  That's just my internal clock.  Nothing wrong with it or anybody else's."

I think I personally need ""Killing in the Name Of"" to be played in the middle of all my rides.  And the Tina Turner in the low impact was fun, too.  I know Robin can be decisive, but I felt she was less....Robiny (?) than usual?  Not as much with the catch phrases.  I also giggled at her comment regarding why she was going to stop pedaling for a moment - I suspect someone is passing along the comments regarding people's annoyance with that.  Anyway, good stuff!"

So when I say it's not possible, I mean with the current set up in the US - I've only seen the portable card machines used in a couple restaurants ever in the US.  We just got behind chip a year or two ago.  It'll take a long time before restaurants catch up to universally using tableside payment systems."

Frugal,fekdrj5,t1_fej1ydi,1579197924.0,"Yep, my mom worked in a factory and at the end of the manufacturing line, stuff was either put in the generic or name brand box.  Canned vegetables generally aren't labeled until they are ready to be shipped because they don't know which label to put on them (generic v. name brand).  Listen to recall notices - like when peanut butter was recalled a few years ago, it was a list of generic and name brands that were impacted by the recall.  It's all made in the same facility, just different packaging.  (not universal, but very often the case)"

Pantyhose or spanx, a romper, whatever - it all takes time to undo and then re-do.  I remember reading that the women on the set of Mad Men had to wear vintage appropriate underwear on set and their bathroom breaks took ages just for having to disassemble and reassemble their clothes.  While things have gotten better, they're certainly not perfect.  Oh, and we wash our hands."

Greyhounds,feedkxd,t3_eojrat,1579031558.0,"In our area (Texas), there aren't shelters where you choose your hounds.  It's done through agencies.  We filled out an application and then they came and did a home visit to look at our fence and stuff.  They get dogs one at a time off the farm/track and they go to fosters until the right home can be found.  We needed a dog who was cat and kid friendly, so the foster tested the dog that was currently waiting for a home and found her to be non-reactive to kids and cats.  It's still a bit of a gamble, but they matched her with us and told us to be careful about the introductions (walked us through the steps, etc).  Turns out that the cat and our greyhound are besties who had waited their whole lives to find each other.  It was seriously love at first sight.  She settled in easily, no big issues at all.  

The whole process is kind of scary because the adoption people tried to brace you for everything that could go wrong.  They walk you through how this will be difficult, and that will be difficult, and this will probably be a disaster.  But in the end, only one or two things ends up being difficult.  Ours hated to be kenneled.  I figure she'd been kenneled for 6 years on the track and was done with it.  So we stopped kenneling her and she took up residence on the couch where she's happy as a....well, a greyhound on a couch.  The worst part of the whole process was her spay surgery - it was rough.  They found out that her reproductive tract was misshapen when they went to remove it, and instead of being done in a small incision, they had to make a big one.  Then she had trouble with the anesthesia and the recovery was just really really hard.  Two other fosters in our group ended up having major complications/death from their spays in the same month.  I was not prepared for that to happen, but she pulled through and now we know that she does no take well to anesthesia.  This was with a greyhound-specific vet who knows about the difficulties greys have with anesthesia, so she's just extra super sensitive.  Tough lot in life."

pelotoncycle,fdnefd8,t3_em86e3,1578584045.0,"Just a little vaguely related rant, if I may?  There's a Planet Fitness commercial out right now where it shows a spin class and the teacher says ""oh, this guy dropped to the bottom of the leaderboard, shame him!!!"" or something like that.  And all the class turns and hisses and shames the guy.  My mom told me she assumes that's what the Peloton is like.  I really, truly hate this commercial.  I hate that it gives people the idea that spinning/Peloton/group classes are shame based.  I think that it's not going to encourage someone who is self conscious to go to Planet Fitness, instead it's going to encourage them to stay home entirely.  I just truly hate it.  

In all my years of group exercise classes, I've only seen one instructor do anything shame-based.  I complained to the leader of the classes (Camp Gladiator) and that instructor was GONE so fast.  Instructors, especially Peloton instructors, are so positive and encouraging.  I wish these scare tactics didn't give people the wrong impression.

Sorry, I know that's not normally the point of the daily thread, I just wanted to get it off my chest."

Assuming you live in a community property state in the US, both statements are correct.

whole30,fdenuxt,t1_fdee0om,1578342951.0,"I have \*thoughts\* about the whole SWYPO idea.  For me, the idea of, for example, freeze drying an apple chip so it's the texture of a potato chip does absolutely nothing to trigger me to want to eat potato chips.  Same with mixing bananas and eggs to make ""pancakes"" - I literally eat two eggs and a banana for breakfast 3-4 days a week.  Mixing them up on a griddle doesn't magically make me want to go on a pancake binge.  But everybody might react differently.  If you're eating savory pancake type items to try and recreate pancakes in your life - basically recreating your current diet, just with compliant ingredients, then no.  It's not in the spirit of the program.  Only you know that for yourself.  That being said, there are plenty of gatekeeping purists who would shout me down for even suggesting it might be ok..."
