bjj,feg7z9z,t3_eozl02,1579081358.0,"I did ITF taekwondo for a long time and found you never really pressure test a lot of the stand up arts. It is easy to learn a 'movement' when its efficacy is not being tested in a confrontation, and particularly when belt promotions are often recounting movements either as set sparring or patterns. I couldn't get my black belt without being decent at sparring, but I don't know if that is a mandatory requirement, and it was all still quite artificial anyway.

In BJJ from day one you aren't only learning movements in isolation, but also positions, transitions, escapes, counters, framing, submissions kinda all at the same time.

I found striking arts to be like learning to play an instrument, and BJJ to be like trying to play the whole orchestra."

explainlikeimfive,fecvgvb,t1_feccau0,1578986225.0,"Unfortunately your question, even if unintentional, showed a total lack of understanding of the specialism by appearing to simplify it as solely drug administration.

However, there is already a bit of an answer to your question regarding use of software to automatically perform a task. Look up total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) which uses the drugs propofol (Marsh, Schieder or Kataria models) and Remifentanil (Minto model) as continuous, target controlled infusions to maintain anaesthesia using pumps in real-time as these agents are rapid/onset, short acting drugs. This is however, as an alternative to using volatile gases to maintain hypnosis, and for surgical analgesia in the immediate period only, and tjerefore an alternative technqiue and a small piece of the puzzle. Adjustments still need to be made by the operator based on the clinical situation, and the pharmacokinetic modelling of the pumps is flawed. Marsh assumes fixed rate constants with variable compartment size, whereas Schieder assumes fixed compartment size and variable rate constants. A new model is coming out soon, based on data collected from thousands upon thousands of cases. Yet this again goes to show it wasn't the software creating this, but real-world use and experience."
explainlikeimfive,fec31xk,t3_eods9v,1578965932.0,"Which part of their job are you saying can be done by the software?

Is it running down to the ED to help resuscitate a 2 year old that is crashing due to meningococcal sepsis? Hell, make it a 2-week old the size of a melon. 

Is it using an endoscopic camera to place an endotracheal tube in a patient with a base of tongue tumour?

Is it administering anaesthesia to a frightened pregnant mother who is haemorrhaging and needing an emergency caesarian section? (there are two patients here)

Is it seeing a moribund vasculopathic respiratory cripple who needs a new shoulder, and deciding on, as well as administering the entire anaesthetic through ultrasound - guided nerve blocks?

Is it anaesthetising the child for the traumatic brain injury requiring a craniotomy and cautious physiological management?

Or perhaps the clapped-out 80 year old rushed in with a burst aorta, requiring general anaesthesia without being euthanized, several invasive lines, multiple infusions of inotropic drugs as well as coping with aortic cross clamping, management of hypothermia, massive blood loss and potential DIC, likely need for dialysis, post-operative pain relief with some sort of additional nerve catheter technique (IF they survive) all done while coordinating a team of roughly 10 people simultaneously?
