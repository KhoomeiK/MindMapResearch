cringe,fgl8l45,t3_eysvya,1580885904.0,"I wonder if she also follows the bible's rules on women with menstruation:


""When a woman has her regular flow of blood, the impurity of her monthly period will last seven days, and anyone who touches her will be unclean till evening

20 Anything she lies on during her period will be unclean, and anything she sits on will be unclean.

21 Whoever touches her bed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening.

22 Whoever touches anything she sits on must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean till evening.

23 Whether it is the bed or anything she was sitting on, when anyone touches it, he will be unclean till evening.""



Its a good thing people dont just pick and choose the religious rules/guidelines that they want to follow."

FunnyandSad,fgk22mz,t1_fgk0qy2,1580855884.0,"You dont seem to understand how job scarcity works. Props to you for living in an area with so much available employment.

I guess if i want to move out of an area with no jobs, ill have to save up some money.

Hmm to save some money, i guess ill have to get a job, but no one is hiring. 

Well company x has offered a job but they have an arbitration agreement.

Im not an idiot so ill continue to be unemployed and uninsured while my $900/month medication drains my savings.

Only an idiot would try to get a job when it's their only offer right?

I guess im a ""fucking idiot"" for taking my first offer in months"

Bonfires are big, if you want to argue that they arent then why make the distinction from just a regular fire.

Can we post actual gatekeeping rather than facebook memes"
