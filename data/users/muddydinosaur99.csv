He just compared himself to MLK last week."
nba,ffoo4yg,t3_eudfdj,1580079808.0,Just here to see how Kyrie turns this around and makes it about himself.

nfl,ffoazfs,t1_ffoajx1,1580075855.0,They commit pass interference in the endzone on purpose? So they can defer giving up a td to someone else on the defense?
nfl,ffoa8uh,t1_ffoa0ob,1580075638.0,There is a difference between not allowing a td... and committing pass interference in the endzone to keep your streak alive.
nfl,ffo9sbk,t3_eubf89,1580075476.0,Tre White isn’t very good. I never understood why everyone was Dick riding him all season.
nfl,ffo9cdb,t1_ffo8uk3,1580075345.0,Not a ton of competition. Noodle arm Brees. RB Lamar. Overrated DW4. Russ and Tannehill is the only comp

nfl,ffo1jpk,t1_ffo13ch,1580073198.0,Is it? Or does it just piss you off that much? Lmao
nfl,ffo15de,t1_ffo0153,1580073063.0,Lamar just can’t get it to anyone else without them having a huge catch radius. Because of his wildly inaccurate passes.
nfl,ffo03rs,t1_ffnzwnc,1580072847.0,"Baker started 13 games last year. You can’t be this brain dead right?

By your logic 7 is extremely close to 13. 

Keep going, I’m enjoying this."
nfl,ffnznx7,t1_ffnzetx,1580072702.0,"Again, it’s not. And repeating yourself doesn’t make it any less wrong. If it were that close then why does baker still have more in two seasons than Lamar does? 

Keep reaching big fella."
nfl,ffnz4yr,t1_ffnxp1p,1580072508.0,Why would I be in shambles? Lamar’s Pro Bowl week has literally been my dream scenario.
nfl,ffnynie,t1_ffnxzko,1580072340.0,"No. It’s not close at all considering Baker has 50 tds in two seasons, and Lamar has 42. 

You couldn’t be more wrong lmao."
nfl,ffnwpqh,t1_ffnvz81,1580071735.0,"Baker has 50 td passes. 

If you think 36 is close to 50... just wow"
nfl,ffnwl8v,t1_ffnwe2f,1580071683.0,I don’t necessarily think you can improve THAT much (in throwing ability) at this level of the sport. But then again we’ve also never seen a QB run the way he does. So anything is possible.
nfl,ffnw6p6,t1_ffnvbjv,1580071515.0,"He probably would be lighting it up since he has a fucking cannon, great accuracy, and their is absolutely no pass rush."
nfl,ffnvwod,t1_ffnvg2b,1580071477.0,agreed. He is productive for sure. He will only go as far as his legs take him. See RG3
nfl,ffnv9lj,t1_ffnuwxm,1580071304.0,Ya’ll got a wannabe qb waiting for his legs to take one big hit and end his elite running ability resulting in a shortened career.
nfl,ffnuimv,t1_ffnu32s,1580071008.0,"I’ve put plenty of stock in his lack of throwing skill since he was drafted. You are acting like this is a new concept or something. It’s just being highlighted now because it’s the only football game on. And he can’t even hit wide open receivers with no pass rush in his face. 

 No way around it. Tough week for Lamar"
nfl,ffnu0tw,t1_ffnrg63,1580070811.0,Uhhhh are we watching him trying to throw to these WRs where there is literally no pass rush? It’s almost as bad as that precision passing performance.
nfl,ffntwm7,t1_ffnrfy4,1580070764.0,Even when baker doesn’t make the PB ya’ll still can’t stop talking about him. Insecure much?
nfl,ffntowu,t1_ffns8ke,1580070675.0,Humphrey gets roasted and Lamar shows he is anything but a qb since Monday.

MMA,ffjytrk,t1_ffjy9ce,1580010714.0,He was awkwardly looking away from Blaydes a few times throughout the whole fight though. Maybe the shoulder had something to do with it.

nfl,ffj42uy,t1_ffj244w,1579989870.0,By no means is this a testament to bisky’s passing ability. This a testament to how bad of a passer Lamar is. My unborn child would be just as consistent of a passer as Lamar is

nfl,ffgrr6w,t1_ffgm6lw,1579913386.0,"Because that defense he played against consisted of 2 potatos, half a hamstring, 6 feral cats, a lesbian, and a cum sock. I’m more surprised he didn’t score three times in 2 minutes."

No one in the history of the NFL has or ever will throw for that many tds on that few of passing attempts. It’s simply unobtainable.
