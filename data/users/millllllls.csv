In regards to Schumacher, earnings like that aren't a direct comparison, as that includes payouts from individual races and not all coming from just a contract to sit in the driver's seat. Same with Federer, Nadal, professional golfers, and other fighters--the payouts of non-team athletes is typically dependent upon how many events they win that year unless they have a set contract. They're all IF/THEN payouts--if you win this tournament/race/event, then you get paid a purse. 

I realize other athletes have made more than $73M in a year based on their performances over that year, it's just wild that Canelo is making that much just to show up--no if/then about it, the dude is making $73M. A contract on the front end is different than somebody winning multiple races, fights, or grand slams in one year. It's more impressive to win it through events like that, don't get me wrong here, but $73M is such a huge amount for someone to just bet an athlete will perform well."
