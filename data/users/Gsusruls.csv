At the end of Infinity War, Thor single handedly takes on Thanos ... and wins. Were it not for the snap using his last few breaths, that would have been the win. Shame Thor did not go for Thanos' head, indeed.

A full movie later, we again get Thor vs Thanos, except Thanos does NOT have all of the infinity stones, and Thor has Captain and Stark for backup. Except this time, Thanos not only holds his own, he downright beats the shit out of them. The only saving grace to this scene is that we get a Captain vs Thanos 1:1 showdown, to complement the same showdown between Thanos and Stark in the prior film (we all know we wanted that).

The relative strength of the characters is set to convenience the cinematic experience, but is otherwise painfully inconsistent and cannot be predicted. I am forced to keep in mind that Disney is not trying to be ""consistent""; they are selling theatre tickets (and sell, they did!).
