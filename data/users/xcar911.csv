offmychest,fedapoq,t1_fecyrp1,1579005906.0,"i don’t sugar coated it. i would stay up until 4-5 am, or i would get very angry, irritated, lose my patience. also it would  made me loss my appetite. but the strategy move is to have something to replace that withdrawal, get tire by going to the gym, read a book to unwind the head, maybe maditate, a hot or cold shower, or i did a lot masturbation to help me sleep , or even try to act that you’re sleepy lol sounds crazy but it did help a lot haha. weed is a very jealous bitch."
offmychest,fedacz3,t1_fecvdcu,1579005562.0,"yeah, i understand what you’re saying. i started smoking weed because of migraines mainly, and anxiety.  then i become a recreational smoker, and kinda good that you didn’t lose motivation, i did after a while. but i would say that weed makes one feel normal, and therefore not normal without. yeah, life is hard without drugs but a hell with them. just know that weed is not the only thing that helps depression and anxiety, of course weed not only “helps” but is super easy just to smoke than rather go to the gym, meditate and other means that do help as well. just know a big chunk of that is withdrawal. i also make something that counters that instead of only stop smoking. CBT therapy is very effective, look it up. also maybe a pet. wishing you the best, happy day"
offmychest,fed9u1w,t1_fectvhj,1579005032.0,"awesome, what matters is the decision made. nothing else. lets us don’t stumble on something already behind us. is easy? no. is it possible ? absolutely."
offmychest,fed8giu,t1_fecm7c0,1579003601.0,"yeah absolutely, i did considered myself an addiction, like a closet addict . while i was never diagnosed, i did believed that pot wasn’t addictive BUT anything can be if you don’t handle it, and i didn’t. to be honest , from someone who smoke for years and spend thousands of dollars on weed, edibles, wax and all of the marijuana form; its not worth it. it true that someone people seem to handle it well but i didn’t. lemme tell you i was proud of myself cuz before trying weed i didn’t do anything nor liquor. there is nothing proud to be a so called stoner. i hate it it . but past is past, and i don’t want to stumble over something that is behind me. my personal tip, don’t even try it, you will no be enlightened nor it will open your mind, you may feel like it but no."
offmychest,fecghh1,t1_fecdjtw,1578973344.0,"Bro you say best, i do feel like waking up from a dream it’s like feeling life more intensely. probably among the worst thing of weed is that it makes you feel normal with it, thus i had to smoke every fucking day to feel normal again. to be honest my worst fear right now would be relapsing again, but i already destroyed my bong, and i don’t want to he in that hole again, never again. i do wish you the best and know you got a random stranger rooting for you"
