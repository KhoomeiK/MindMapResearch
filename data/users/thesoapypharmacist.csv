Awwducational,fgixq7w,t1_fgiexby,1580833128.0,"My husband, sister-in-law, and father-in-law all have varying degrees of dyslexia. They’re coping mechanism when reading is (first couple of letters-context guessing- last couple of letters).  So that could very well be why you read certain words incorrectly"
politics,fgg7s4y,t3_ey5v9u,1580756089.0,"I’m a pharmacist, my husband and I pay more taxes every year than my parents paid for their house. Still, I always vote for the extra penny SPLOST tax because it provides extra parks for our area. And, I would be happy on both sides of the counter to see all people have healthcare. But, there are pockets of people who don’t want government in their day to day activities. A woman got upset with me one day because the blood pressure machine asked for her age. People don’t want to show ID’s to purchase anything or write checks. Moonshiner mentality. Living off the grid, etc. You will not get these people to participate in Any National program. People don’t want to have to show ID’s to vote (one of the most national things you can do.) People don’t want to be on registries (guns). It’s a very “invasion of their privacy” thing.   There are senior citizens that refuse to sign up for Medicare Part D because of this although they would likely not have to pay for anything due to their finances. 

I think it would have to start with people in their 18-30’s (this is not only the healthiest, but most likely working age) are in the national plan, both paying in and receiving the benefits and then as they age it will include all younger generations. This would phase out Medicare as it ages with people. And, I think eventually Medicaid although those are usually state run plans.  There is precedent for this mechanism. When the government upped the retirement age they started with a younger generation, not the one that was about to retire. 

There still will have to always be the capitalist option to pay for better:  concierge doctors, more expensive/newer treatments...   Even Medicare sells Advantage plans. There are a lot of generic drugs and proven treatments plans for most things that would work for 99% of America 

Also, I would be lying if I didn’t tell you that 80% of the reason I’m behind this is for 1 God-Damn standardized insurance card, so I could look up everyone easily and not have to memorize a thousand different ways to override stupid rejections and a thousand other reasons insurance makes my job insufferable."

And I just responded, “Si, mucho grande mujer.”  (Yes, very big woman). And laughed it off. I learned a little bit in high school. Nothings going to stop me.
