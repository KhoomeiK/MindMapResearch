Stop smoking, cut back on drinking, exercise more, etc. I KNOW I need to fix these things especially at my age now before they cause much worse problems down the road but having the willpower to stick with it and keep pushing myself to make the right decisions is a struggle. 

As far as fixing it? I don’t know how to be honest. If anyone has any advice I’m all for it."

I spent a great many of nights sitting on whatever I can find to be a seat having a smoke by the dumpsters in the back parking lot of a restaurant and hanging out with plenty of folks like this. Talking about life and dreams and struggles and achievements. I like going back home from time to time just to remind me where I came from and to keep me humble. Some folks after 20 years never left this status. Some did.

PublicFreakout,felgndw,t1_fekefz4,1579221725.0,I gravitated towards heavy instrumental based music but over a wide spectrum of genres. Essentially I heard the music better the lower the pitch and needed it louder as the pitch increased.
PublicFreakout,felghlh,t1_fekd9j1,1579221619.0,Yea lip reading helped a lot. Especially with folks that have higher pitched voices. I can still lip read fine. Once my hearing came aided I didn’t need to read lips to hear everything. And I can turn it up beyond someone’s regular hearing if need be. I’ve been able to catch people talking lowly several feet away. I haven’t tested how far but come to think of it it’d be a fun experiment.
PublicFreakout,felg8ri,t1_fekbwml,1579221455.0,Used to because my brain was processing all of these new sounds and it was just an overload. But now I don’t. I upgraded to a legit expensive pair and have volume control. I can quickly turn my wife down if I do something stupid.
PublicFreakout,felfy4r,t1_fek9kqf,1579221254.0,My wife is soft spoken and it was soon after we got married. She has an accent as well so communicating was a challenge and as much as she tried I could tell she was frustrated by it. Not in the she’s gonna leave me but it was clearly something I felt I needed to remedy and decided to just try some.
PublicFreakout,felfr8y,t1_fekfbf3,1579221124.0,"Yea I also have shitty eyesight on top the bad hearing. I got the shitty end of the stick in the senses department. But hey, I can pick really heavy shit up."
PublicFreakout,felfmg7,t1_fek864f,1579221034.0,"Well that fart came from me as I was on a steady 100% daily fiber intake which absolutely gasses me up. I had a biggun too at least a food 4-6 second booty blaster that’ll clap your cheeks like a stripper tryna get that money. 

And I like farting. At 34 years of age nearly every bout of flatulence I released always got at minimal a Beavis and Butthead style chuckle. 

Anyways, I was laying there watching TV at a normal volume with my wife when I suddenly stood up with that shit eating grin cause I knew what was coming and as soon as she saw my face, a look of horror emerged because she knew what the fuck was about to happen. 

4-6 second category? Nah that beast had to hit the 10-12 but what was beautiful is how it started as this low pat pat pat pat rumble then transitioned in a faster pat pat pat pat as it increased in pitch ending with a nice baby elephant trunk squeal of delight. 

I didn’t know farts echoed and produced so many octaves."

PublicFreakout,feju59d,t3_epjc33,1579185909.0,"I’ve mentioned this before but I grew up with profound to severe hearing loss and my mom never got me hearing aids because an ear doc told her I’d be fine without them. I got my first set of hearing aids when I was 34 and damn if that doctor was wrong because there was soooo much shit I was not hearing. I remember going outside and just standing there and hearing the birds, the wind rustling the leaves in the trees, distant cars driving, and inside simple things like the hum of the fridge. It was overwhelming and emotional. I was both happy and sad. Happy because of all these new and wonderful sounds but sad because I missed so much throughout the years. I absolutely can relate to this.
