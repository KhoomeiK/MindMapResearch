ballpython,ffaw6zo,t3_esfljf,1579745907.0,"I love yours. I have one too, probably about the same size. It's a lifesaver. So much easier to map it and keep the right humidity and it holds heat better than glass. My girl loves it. I got her a giant treated log to climb and she plays on it. PVC is the way to go."
creepyPMs,fei6e4f,t3_ep2110,1579131293.0,"Even if she didnt have a boyfriend, the incessant begging is such a turn off. Then accusing her of being a liar about it. These are not qualities single ladies are looking for dude."
AskReddit,fec5kl4,t1_fe8v7tj,1578966983.0,"This isn't as weird as you think. theres full videos or weights crushing random things you might enjoy. Like crayons, paint, playdoh."
creepyPMs,fdp1pi1,t1_fdp0ytw,1578617905.0,No.  I feel confident enough to speak for the entirely of all the women on the planet.
creepyPMs,fdp1ee9,t1_fdoyhbi,1578617697.0,Conair or Remington? I mean theres got to be a sliding scale.
creepyPMs,fdp1ag9,t3_emgtrj,1578617623.0,This is so corny it could be a field in the opening of a horror movie franchise.
AskReddit,fdp113x,t1_fdp01a1,1578617450.0,"The guitars in the intro are crisp and catchy. The momentary pause after the intro is perfect and you hang on that note. When I hang out with people who dont like metal or make a comment that it's all screaming. I play cemetary gates. Its mild yet powerful, you can understand all the words. You can change minds on music with 1 song."
AskReddit,fdos4cc,t1_fdnvc5u,1578611651.0,I would have said cemetary gates or cowboys from hell maybe.
AskReddit,fdlvx01,t1_fdlv3w8,1578533773.0,It's been a decade so the majority of it is fine. Just a couple symptoms now and I cant tell what's from aging and whats from latent lyme symptoms. We are awesome for getting through it though. And being the few who know what it's like and show support. I'm glad you're better too in some ways anyway.
AskReddit,fdlviwa,t1_fdk88p1,1578533488.0,I had a cracked molar that would periodically break off pieces. That sucked. Hung around for 10nyears until one day I was in sever pain I had to get it out. I had tried once before but it was aspen dental who doesn't have the greatest reputation. I also fainted and they bailed on it.  A couple years later in agony I called 1800 dentist and found the single most patient dentist who finally for that sucker out. Took Nitris to calm me tf down. I'm actually looking forward to getting 4 wisdom teeth removed.one day.
AskReddit,fdlv9si,t1_fdkhgqi,1578533312.0,"I was going to join one of those medical trial things to help make a vaccine but I weighed pros and cons and while a vaccine is the greater good, I was too afraid to be the lab rat and backed out."
AskReddit,fdluzhq,t1_fdk9f3n,1578533120.0,"I hear ya. Mine was an easy diagnosis. I had a big red circle that formed white rings over 4 days. 

I remember going to the doctor and being on 850mg of amoxycillian 3x per day. Every day for a month. I couldn't move. I just ate and sleep and cried in pain. 

I remember rocking in a ball on the floor begging to go to a hospital. But there was no point in going. I had to ride it out. I wanted to die. Death would have been kinder. 

A month later I was better but it was and periodically still is like.....messages in my brain dont connect right. I have a great memory but my short term memory is either great or non existant. Like I can ask you what time you get out of work tomorrow 3 times and it wont register. I still have joint pain but I dont know how much is lyme related or growing pains, at 38. 

And I can sleep like it's my super power. give me 5 minutes. I can sleep anywhere any time even if I just woke up from 8 hours of full sleep.

Had to be 12 years or more now. I didnt have that bone pain for as long as you did, like you did. It was probably because I had only 1 disease and it was caught early. 

Also the bloodwork is stupid. $200 and theres a 50/50 change of a false positive or false negative.  We just went with the target as a diagnosis."
AskReddit,fdfcizg,t1_fde2r08,1578358473.0,Just want to say good luck. I hope you get the job and have a better future.
AskReddit,fdfakms,t3_ekt5n3,1578357169.0,This literally happened to me today for the first time in my life. I did go to work. It was ok.
YouShouldKnow,fdckyir,t3_ekjllg,1578277487.0,What? How? I've brought a handful of pets I found to local vets and if it had a chip they kept the pet there and contacted the people it belonged to. They should have never let the people leave nor gave out your information. That's sort of a violation if privacy.
electronic_cigarette,fd9ej0r,t3_eka14g,1578232256.0,I'm thinking of getting a rotating spice rack or one of those Keurig k cup holder things to organize my juices.
cats,fcijvbk,t3_eh5p8n,1577663767.0,We have the same couch.
TalesFromRetail,fc0s8vp,t1_fc0awkt,1577298429.0,I love this idea.
TalesFromRetail,fc040j5,t1_fbzfco3,1577277506.0,Congrats to every one of us that survived the last 40 days.
TalesFromRetail,fc03pfs,t1_fbzx10g,1577277069.0,"We have a fraud department that has to call the billing phone number and reach the person to confirm an order was placed. 3 ruined christmases so far this year. I'm the only one who ruined haunnakah. I've also ruined 2 weddings, 1 mothers day a 4 birthdays in 5 years. Sometimes it's really UPS that ruined it by being late or whatever but have you tried calling UPS? So much easier to yell at a small business."
IDontWorkHereLady,fc03ji3,t1_fbz57uy,1577276829.0,"There was recently an article of a guy who was sick or injured or something lying on the floor for 20 minutes before anyone noticed. If you're a giant corporation you've got to treat your employees well, I mean at least treat them like humans."
IDontWorkHereLady,fbz4ujt,t1_fbxzatc,1577235119.0,I live in an area with tons of farmers markets and fresh produce. I dont take advantage of it as much as I should. But id rather give a local farmer money than a corporation. They're often cheaper too.
