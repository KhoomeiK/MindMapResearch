If you're willing to keep up with her and quality of life is there that's what matters. That and what the vet says. Interested of you wouldn't mind posting an update"

DogCare,ffipitd,t3_etuocf,1579979503.0,Can we see some pictures? I'm a professional dog groomer and dont understand how that could happen. What was their explanation?
cookingforbeginners,ffie8qv,t3_etpn0j,1579971772.0,In my opinion a pressure cooker doubles as a rice cooker and is more versatile.
DogCare,ffie2cs,t3_ets7o1,1579971656.0,What kind of dog is she. How mobile is she?

But no, they didnt have personal sizes (8-10oz) bottles. 

You dont have to be rude. 

Even if I didnt want to go to the store. I found a way around needing the apple juice."
instantpot,ff4qlwr,t1_ff4m2nq,1579570082.0,"Okay... well I walked around Walmart and they didnt have the individuals and I dont really like apple juice. 

Used a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar and turned out just fine

Edit: not to mention you edited your comment from ""go buy some"" equally as rude. 

Bot everyone can just ""go buy"" something"
