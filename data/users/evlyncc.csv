AskReddit,fcw41di,t3_ej83f9,1578016652.0,"When I wrote my math finals, all students of 10th grade had to sit in a very big theatre and write their finals there at the same time (our school had one) and everyone had a single desk with a number. When we entered the theatre we had to pull a number and then sit at that desk with the number on the paper. We all were around 100-200 students and I and my bully pulled number where I was sitting right behind him in my finals. I was almost crying bc he bullied me really bad even though we went to the principal and even then he didnâ€™t let me be haha.

So yeah, this was a vvv big suprise which I cant forget up to this day"
