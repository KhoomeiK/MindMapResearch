PoliticalHumor,ffcui36,t1_ffclmjl,1579807520.0,This was always going to be the result of the impeachment. The purpose of going through with it *anyways* was to *hopefully* show people how important it is to vote.
pics,ffcueeu,t1_ffchi7v,1579807461.0,But all the other ways you can be killed don’t erase the fact that guns have no *other* purpose. They are a tool with a single use and that single use is a bad one.
pics,ffcub9r,t1_ffchekv,1579807411.0,"Your arguments *aren’t* substantive. They all just boil down to “I want guns”. And that’s fine. I want lots of things. But sometimes what we want is dumb, and the availability of guns in a country where gun violence is an epidemic is dumb."
pics,ffcu6go,t1_ffchc0a,1579807333.0,"And you have no idea how frustrating it is to someone who’s lost 3 friends and 5 family members to guns. Some suicides, some shot in the line of duty. Honestly, people *wanting* to own guns is a poor balm when you get that phone call. Again. And a;l the excuses about self defence fall on unsympathetic ears, when almost *all* of those deaths were trained, and were armed, and it didn’t matter. Because guns don’t protect you when the other guy has them too."
pics,ffctfoz,t1_ffcgwme,1579806900.0,Look up suicide stats of gun owners. It takes time to kill your self. It takes effort and a lot of times there’s an opportunity to stop midway. But not with a bullet. It just makes it all too easy.
pics,ffctaae,t1_ffcgmli,1579806813.0,"We’re probably never going to get to no violence, but we can make it all less lethal without guns. Guns just make it worse."
pics,ffcg8kv,t1_ffcern2,1579798795.0,"Well you got me. My exaggeration must completely negate all of my points. Clearly only good people own guns and all the folks shot out there were asking for it. That’s sarcasm, in case, like hyperbole, it’s a novel concept."
pics,ffcfy9u,t1_ffcdo38,1579798620.0,But no guns in the exact same situation means nobody gets shot. How hard is it to grasp that concept?
pics,ffcfv6x,t1_ffcd6rq,1579798567.0,"Your info is all circumstantial at best. It’s all based on your own assumptions. People have bad days. Everyone does. If you have a gun, and a bad day, then there is a chance you will use it. That is the simple inescapable truth. If you have no gun, you can’t use it. And before you go back into all the “but a car” “but a knife” “but a rock” arguments, NONE of those have the speed or efficiency of purpose that a gun has, because only a gun is designed with one single purpose. To put a bullet in something at a disastrous velocity."
dndmemes,ffcfmy9,t1_ffcckp7,1579798429.0,That’s fair.
pics,ffcfmc7,t1_ffccj85,1579798418.0,"I just think that having a gun is an option nobody should have. If we’re arguing, and you don’t have a gun, at worst it devolves into hitting. But probably not even that. If you *do* have a gun though, and it gets to the hitting phase, you might pull it. And sudden;y I’m in a fight for my life, not just an argument. Not having a gun means that isn’t the case."
pics,ffcfg3u,t1_ffcc3v5,1579798311.0,"But none of that target training is for what actually matter when you’re threatened and scared and your emotions are up. It’s the training that lets your judgement survive in those situations, because if you’re pulling a gun when you’re *not* in distress, then you’re not a good guy with a gun. You’re a bad guy. And the gun escalates all of that stuff. What your statistics—which are still *all* based on hearsay and so-called eye-witness reports, the least reliable of all evidence—don’t say and can’t say is how many people *would* have been shot if everyone was armed. So many people don’t get shot simply by virtue of not having a gun."
dndmemes,ffcc1k5,t1_ffcaoel,1579796199.0,Only if you ever actually play with them.
pics,ffcb41e,t1_ffcawjx,1579795614.0,I’m not arguing with the logic of branding. I’m arguing that it’s a bad statement. And I don’t think guns need rallies. They won’t have their feelings hurt if they go away.
pics,ffcazva,t1_ffcajmk,1579795540.0,"Because all these pro gun arguments are fables. They’re based on specific circumstances. They’re all “what if’s” that have a statistically negligent (that’s too close to zero to count) chance of ever happening. They’re no more likely than never needing them. They cancel each other out. 

Whereas if you are carrying a weapon and you are afraid, the chance that you will escalate the situation by pulling it or even just flashing it is infinitely greater. Not having guns is the solution to that problem."
pics,ffcakgo,t1_ffca33e,1579795269.0,"Thrown out because they are 100% unprovable. You go out with a gun and nobody kills you, you wanna attribute that to being armed?"
pics,ffcai9t,t1_ffc9yh3,1579795232.0,Because it doesn’t fit with the “guns are good” narrative.
pics,ffcagq8,t1_ffc9wq5,1579795206.0,"Nope, I hand type every response! It’s just that so many people are making the same weak argument that the same response applies!"
pics,ffc9n7h,t1_ffc8seh,1579794691.0," Because way more guns are used to harm than to save. Do we get rid of vaccines because sometimes rapists get sick? The weight is far balanced to the bad. In the us anyways. So maybe the issue isn’t taking *everyone’s* guns away, just Americans?"
pics,ffc9ip2,t1_ffc8seh,1579794611.0,"I’m not refusing anything, you seem to have a single track mind, that guns are the only defence from danger. It’s a fallacy. And if you are cool with making a law that only people who literally haves zero other way to defend themselves—can’t talk, can’t walk away, can’t fight, maybe say mute paraplegics who have the use of one arm? being the only ones allowed to carry a gun, I guess that argument could be made."
pics,ffc9bv2,t1_ffc84eh,1579794493.0,"Guns don’t have a purpose beside putting bullets into things. If you are cool with them never being used to be shot at people, then I’m sure you’re on board with them *only* being allowed at gun ranges, where they stay under lock and key, and never leave the premises? I could live with that."
pics,ffc96nv,t1_ffc7z7f,1579794401.0,This whole thread is about guns. I have zero issue with learning how to protect yourself without a gun. You should learn how to protect yourself. Without a gun.
pics,ffc94f6,t1_ffc7smf,1579794361.0,The whole point of this thread is about guns. I have zero problem with people learning to protect themselves without a gun. In fact I think it’s your responsibility to learn to do just that.
pics,ffc7569,t1_ffc6cc8,1579793089.0,Again. Guns don’t protect people.
pics,ffc73ps,t1_ffc6a7b,1579793062.0,Again. Guns don’t protect people.
pics,ffc6dam,t1_ffc4tia,1579792583.0,"This is simply not true. Training trumps size. Yes, a well trained huge person beats a well trained small person, but training also almost always tends to temper people. It’s relatively rare that two trained people will randomly get into a conflict. Whereas I’d guess that 90% of gun owners have little to no formal training, making them doubly dangerous to everyone. Dangerous in their own use and dangerous if they are disarmed. You want self defence? Go spend a few years learning how to defend yourself. Without a gun. Because all guns do is make every situation more complicated and worse. 

And cut the shit with the cars argument. It’s a garbage argument. What’s next, ban rocks? Cars have a purpose beyond murder. Guns do not. Unless you’re advocating that everyone carry a hunting long rifle everywhere they go."
pics,ffc385c,t1_ffbwpp1,1579790431.0,"Done plenty of travelling, seen plenty of awful stuff. A lot of it was based on fear of men with guns. And my snark doesn’t come from my lack of worldliness, it comes from being told I’m ignorant because I don’t think it’s okay for people to carry the means to end a life with zero effort. I just have a little more respect for human life and I guess a little less faith in the myth of the good guy with a gun."
PoliticalHumor,ffbwdql,t1_ffbsa0f,1579784965.0,I guess she went into every trial assuming whoever she was prosecuting was innocent?

pics,ffb8ff7,t1_ffb1tkl,1579754916.0,"At risk youth is a problem. Rage is a problem. Counselling will help. Better social understanding will help. But disarming them all will help more, and help faster."
pics,ffb8dad,t1_ffb17j9,1579754850.0,"If the *only* way for someone to reasonably survive is to have a gun, then society has *completely* failed. Gun fans always love to go on about infringing on their rights. The rights to *not* be shit and killed should supersede all other rights concerning owning a gun. That’s what it really boils down to, regardless of all the other arguments. Guns make death too easy. It’s cut and dried, and the rest is noise. Stripping a mother of the right to self defence tools is a very very weak argument, and it’s shameful that it’s come to that level of sad fear-mongering. There is no moral high ground there."
pics,ffb0x8m,t1_ffazk5m,1579749063.0,"How does that same child stop the angry boy who brought his dads totally legal semi-automatic to school? What-if’s are also extremely flawed. For every “good” use, there are a thousand bad ones."
pics,ffajdxn,t1_ffaen6t,1579737189.0,"It’s a hopeful quote, and I’d like to believe it’s accurate, but the “good guy with a gun” proposal is flawed at best. Unless that good guy is a) trained, b) aware, c) better than the bad guy, d) willing and able to kill someone in the split second, e) has the opportunity to draw and aim a weapon while he has one trained on him, and f) actually in the right place at the right time, it doesn’t apply. And if he’s *always* armed, how long before human nature makes that good guy into an angry/scared/just plain bad guy? Better scenario is nobody is legally armed so that the authorities can simply subdue *anyone* with a gun, knowing for a fact that they must be a bad guy simply by virtue of having it. Problem solved!"

DemocraticSocialism,ff9r7e6,t1_ff9nr62,1579719292.0,Maybe if you're unhappy with the way the government runs things you should elect better governments?
pics,ff9jpt1,t3_ese2zy,1579714460.0,"I feel like it’s worth pointing out that the favourite argument that “guns don’t kill people, people do” should be applied to the saying “guns save lives”."
DemocraticSocialism,ff9fsqd,t1_fcoctdk,1579712086.0,At least the government has a semblance of oversight. It is (supposedly) accountable to the will of the people. Corporations are accountable to the profit of its shareholders. That’s it. It doesn’t make it good or bad but things like healthcare (and education) shouldn’t be monetized.

These days, commentators aren’t particularly likely to be historians, political scientists or even proper journalists.  Sometimes they’ve got their jobs because they’re loud, or good looking, or both. But there’s still a large part of the population that grew up on news that had a baked in integrity, and they are particularly susceptible to this sort of thing, because even though they like to think that they’re cynics, deep down they’re still romantics and believers. Not all of them, but enough of them remember guys like Walter Cronkite, and they’re predisposed to believe the talking heads."
