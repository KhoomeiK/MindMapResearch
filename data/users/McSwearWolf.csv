He looked at me like I had two heads. I explained that from now on, he plans too, because I’m dead tired of being an employee, a mom, a wife, a maid, the go-to for every childcare option, every school function, every holiday, every family event... You have my full sympathy because the mental load is crushing sometimes."
breakingmom,ff75xyh,t3_erygkv,1579641772.0,We were sick like this last winter. All winter. I was working 30-40 hours plus full time grad school and a kid in kindergarten and BAM we just all started getting sick and it would. Not. Stop. You have my full sympathies. Is there any way you could get a break by having a close family member or friend help you for even a couple hours? Sounds like you need any kind of break! Sending hugs.
breakingmom,ff73h2m,t3_erueq9,1579640368.0,Yaaaasssssss!!!! So happy for you!!!
breakingmom,ff1px8f,t3_eqyvvv,1579483566.0,"Dude, you’re like, keeping FIVE little people alive?! I understand you might feel overwhelmed AF, but you’re a hero in my eyes... Most of us flat out couldn’t hang. You’re amazing. If you were my wife I’d send you on an all-expenses-paid vacation to a quiet beach in Tahiti every damn year of your life!"
breakingmom,fez3j1c,t3_ep7dbu,1579453556.0,"Deleting FB all together was seriously one of the best things I have ever done for my mental health - FB is such a dumpster fire these days anyway... left the other online mommy group (I think it was BTB) when it became a contest over who could BF the longest, complete with flair denoting “golden boobies” or “platinum boobies” or “tin boobies” etc. - I wish I was making this up. Platinum boobies meant you BF until you kid was, idfk, like 10 (sarcasm) but tin boobies meant you only made it like 6 months... yeah I took my tin boobies and noped the F out forever. Like it here 1,000 more. Go Bromos!"
SuicideWatch,fei6brv,t3_ep1a9g,1579131251.0,"That feeling you describe of being afraid of what you might do... I felt that. The call of the void my friend. Next time you have that urge, try just watching the thought pass by. I have it and I think, “wow what a weird thought.” - then I try to move on. Divorce the urge from myself because it really isn’t a sensible impulse. It sounds easier than it is, but mindfulness can help. Using an opposite thought to counteract can help too. Just an idea. I know it’s hard AF. I am rooting for you."
SuicideWatch,fei5u6s,t3_ep2c5g,1579130940.0,"Hey I’ve had these thoughts before. You seem like a cool guy in a tough situation. Things with very young children are often tenuous and stressful. I promise it gets easier to be a parent and spouse once the kids are over age 3 or so. Also... Don’t let people pressure you into more kids if you don’t feel financially and emotionally ready for that - My depression was bad so we stuck with one. I had that tired heavy overwhelmed  feeling like you... had it a lot... and I couldn’t do it all over again from the beginning, you know? I need sleep and some quiet once in a great while. Who knows; Maybe way down the road. I’m trying to find more balance. You can too. Just take it day by day right now, you know? Life insurance is ok and I promise I’ve been where you are, but our kids probably need us more than the money. Here if you ever need to chat."

AskReddit,fdkzy7h,t3_elssvy,1578514594.0,"I thought I was the reincarnation of the Greek god Thor because whenever I squinted my eyes really hard, my brain registered a weird rumbling sound. Later I learned this sound was due to contracting muscles. I was super bummed not to be Thor."
breakingmom,fd6akoq,t1_fd69u49,1578188043.0,You are my hero for this post - I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants. Good on ya mamma!
SuicideWatch,fcmao67,t3_ehxwfs,1577768868.0,"I’m sorry you feel your worth is tied to these things; I have had that struggle as well. I’ve felt like a failure many times. But each day, each year, we begin again. Is it really too late to begin again? My father, for one, did a lot between 47 and 57... perhaps you could too. Whatever you end up deciding, know someone heard you. You are not alone."
SuicideWatch,fcm9ppu,t3_ehx4y9,1577768055.0,"Looking over your post history .... I am not a doctor but before you do this, please have your hormone levels (thyroid) checked out. It can be a factor. Source: I am diagnosed with depression but also had my PCP run thyroid levels several times, and it turns out I have ‘T3 sick syndrome’ / Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) which is a state of adaptation or dysregulation of thyrotropic feedback control wherein the levels of T3 and/or T4 are abnormal, but the thyroid gland does not appear to be dysfunctional. Thus, my issues were misdiagnosed for years. I have a masters in psychology as well, and I know bipolar is very real, but I also think mental healthcare is a real mixed bag. I received different diagnoses from several different experts and I found out about the thyroid issues myself from doing my own research. PS: meds do not work well for people with thyroid issues. Really tricky. As for your grad program... can you take some time off? Talk to your advisor. Explain you are seriously ill at the moment and you need HELP. I hope you’ll stick around and see if you can find more answers. I’m rooting for you."
