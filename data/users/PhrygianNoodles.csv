depression,ffef6so,t1_ffeeo61,1579845707.0,I guess I'm also just mad that nothing in life is as I wish it to be and I'm considered a weirdo if I voice my dissenting opinion. I hate where society is headed and I hate where technology is taking us.
depression,ffef3da,t1_ffeeo61,1579845610.0,"I really get pissed off at people who think highly of themselves. I dont think anyone deserves to do that. 

I do work out and I'm taking a gym class now. I also go running regularly and have begun to enjoy it because I dont have to think while I do it. I really havent gotten into shape to avoid being attractive to girls. Still though I know I'm not that ugly, I just disgust myself. Especially since I have female breast tissue and a small penis, it makes me feel emasculated. 

I do work on myself but it doesnt help. I feel like my brain is deteriorating every day. Sometimes I just fall down in my living room and cry for hours. I get so overwhelmed at how hopeless life is and how no goal will satisfy me. I think about how in the end it all doesnt matter. And even though I've maintained a near perfect college gpa and I do really well at work, I never feel good about it because of that. Theres no endorphine rush or positive thoughts. I just remember:were all going to die and this existence is futile. 

I have a couple hobbies too. Everything in my external life is in decent order and is getting better but I still cant feel happiness. And thoughts of disappointing others cloud my mind even though making them happy wouldnt really bring satisfaction in the end either."
media_criticism,ff46a83,t3_erf7ph,1579556473.0,Well yeah it's a different fucking time period dipshits.
dating,ff24l8g,t3_er19a6,1579493644.0,If you like someone it shouldnt matter all that much how they look in my opinion. I don't have much respect for people who date based on visual stimuli. And I have 0 respect for people who casually hook up.
depression,feutnpe,t3_eqelf5,1579389773.0," I cant pass judgement on people who do horrible things like that? I've never abused or raped anyone but I've done bad things and grown and become a better person. Even with the most horrific acts of evil I only find myself wishing for healing for both the victim and perpetrator. 

My advice would be to try your best to move on and enjoy the time you have left."
Metalcore,fekso75,t1_fejz3m9,1579206784.0,I still love the guy's guitar playing and he seems like a good dude from all of his interviews. He just fucked up and really hurt some people.
dating,fef185m,t1_fef0mg3,1579045783.0,Sex shouldnt be done outside of a commited relationship I believe. Everyone enjoys the feeling of sex duh. But we shouldnt be like animals.
dating,fef0jed,t1_fef08jf,1579045332.0,Ah. Well I try to be real with people but I overwhelm them. They say I get too talkative and I ramble.
dating,fef0fmo,t1_fef0dda,1579045264.0,Missing out on being a whore maybe
dating,feewr7b,t1_fec95ij,1579042885.0,"Also, what's the point in dating someone if I dont like them? I'm really not being judgemental, I'm being honest with myself. I'm nice to these people, I dont talk them down and would never say anything to make someone feel bad about themselves. If I date a girl I dont like then I'm REALLY leading her on. I've managed to break it to them before weve even gone on a real date every time so far. That's better than pretending to like them for 6 months and then dumping them."
dating,feeuwyd,t1_fecfepx,1579041745.0,"So what if they are nice, and pretty? Those arent good prerequisites for a woman! A good girlfriend should be describable as mentally strong, smart, supportive, goal-oriented, values-driven. 

Idgaf if they are pretty and nice. Beauty is not chosen and worked towards and niceness has to be genuine to be worth anything."
dating,feeunu2,t1_fec95ij,1579041590.0,"I go there because I was a drug addict with a psychosis and I didnt try in highschool. I was convinced things would magically work out for me and I guess that was because of the drugs. But I came to my senses and I work hard now to get good grades. And I am smarter than most of the people there considering I'm at the top of every class I take, some without much effort. 

I hate most modern people. I'm disgusted by casual sex and pop culture influences on my generation and I think we all should be. Most people are consumerist tools who never gain a sliver of self awareness. 

And I have to use a persona at first because my real self is too weird. People think I'm autistic if I dont use a filter and just say what's on my mind. 

But yeah, girls that are extremely passionate about playing guitar and listening to metal music that aren't into casual sex and drugs are hard to find..."
dating,feeu6jl,t1_fec79c6,1579041290.0,"I have no desire to go to bars or clubs or party. I've tried such things and it's not my crowd. I dont want to marry a girl right now, but I'd like to date someone seriously. I'd never get married this young it would be foolish. 

I did all kinds of drugs and alcohol and illegal activities in highschool and I want no more of it. 

I'm going to school and have easily been passing all of my classes. I'll be making a liveable amount in a few years. 

Theres really nothing I want to do that I'm not doing besides being in a relationship with someone who interest me. 

Resent women? Why would you think that? Everyone seems to think any criticism of women is hate speech these days, I get it all the time. I'm critical of all dumb people, not just the dumb females. Those who choose their ignorance and have no desire to learn could be killed off and I wouldnt really care. It's one thing to be born slow, but to willfully ignore information that's useful to you because you're too lazy is unacceptable. Those are the kind of people I'm surrounded with. One of the least educated areas of the united states but it's not the schools faults, it's the hyper catholic and christian parents who raise these kids."
dating,fec57f2,t1_fec4o8n,1578966826.0,And what do you mean by give them a shot? I feel like I already am.
dating,fec54jr,t1_fec4o8n,1578966790.0,I know that I dont like a lot of things about them. Like I text these girls and ask them questions and they ALWAYS like me. But I just dont feel like they get me. Because I slowly introduce my real self to them and they respond less to it than my fake persona.
