nursing,ffb6yxe,t1_ffb3szr,1579753466.0,"So, lets say you are extremely short staffed and you need to go to lunch. Let's say you're in the ER and your ratio is 8:1 or you are on med/surg and it is, whatever, 14:1. Or god forbid, an ICU nurse that has 3 patients. What is actually different than if you had a normal 4:1, 6:1, or 2:1 ratio?  

What if the answer was ""Not a damn thing?"" Ask the question. Answer the question. Stabilize to correct. Go to fucking lunch. The law guarantees a lunch for at least 6 hours or so. Your license requires you to make sound judgement. You exercised sound judgement to protect yourself and your patients by going to lunch. Unless you exercise poor judgement and go to lunch when your patient's untreated blood pressure is 52/28, your positive stroke came back ready for tPA, or you went to lunch while waiting on the cath team for your active STEMI, then congratulations- you successfully ate a lunch and no one died."
nursing,ffb4tl8,t1_ffas01c,1579751816.0,"The theory is that it is actually *safer* to be a little understaffed or evenly staffed than overstaffed. Let me explain:

When a unit is overstaffed, the air of urgency and caution subsides. Nurse conversations extend at the nurse's station, patients get rounded on longer, but less frequently. Folks lighten up and joke with each other. The critical eye wanes because the inherent threat of danger is perceived to be less (even if it isn't).

&#x200B;

When a unit is understaffed or staffed *just right* for the census, nurses are stressed to prioritize care to manage their time. They look closer at trends, orders, and times. Patients get moved to imaging faster, results are acted on faster. There is a sense of urgency (even if there doesn't need to be). 

&#x200B;

But like I said, it is a fine line. The goal is to staff to your predicted census. But then a CNA and a nurse call out, the float pool nurse that showed up today is helping another unit, and Susan only works eight hour shift so you go down another at 3. That's the reality.

&#x200B;

Except nursing homes. They just operate at the lowest possible cost they can to keep the doors open. 20:1 doesn't seem safe, yet that would be a *good day* and I don't think I have ever met a happy employee of a nursing home."
nursing,ffb3frm,t1_ffawh2m,1579750798.0,Yeah I'd say you got off pretty damn well. Count your stars.
nursing,ffb18od,t1_ffas9ij,1579749279.0,"I can chime in. I worked in ER for over ten years  at a major metropolitan facility and moved in to informatics as an analyst. It is, hands down, the best decision I have ever made. I am a  nursing consultant with an emphasis on technical solutions for my hospital. I found out I loved it by volunteering with a major eHR change process with my facility. I then applied for a position with the team afterwards and got the job. Apparently, that is a common path.

&#x200B;

To move *beyond* your question- here's why I love this job:

&#x200B;

You embed yourself in every unit in the hospital. Here is my last few days:

&#x200B;

Spent time in NICU after their system went down navigating erroneous chart transfers between one system and another coordinating with the vendor.

&#x200B;

Attended a root cause analysis meeting for an adverse medication incident that did not end well to provide insight in to the limitations of the documentation system, technical solutions for the staff and their leadership, and analyze workflow issues based on my nursing experience.

&#x200B;

Spent time in a procedure lab figuring out how to implement a new medication scanning process that I am developing with a small team while observing the circulator's role in a VF ablation procedure. It was an interesting six hours.

&#x200B;

Spent time in outpatient rehab looking in to an electronic solution for their intake process as well as troubleshooting workflow issues with a therapy process.

&#x200B;

Built an ER system for patient flow for implementation at the end of the month (that actually sucked, but the end result is badass and satisfying when you know every facility on the system in the city is using *your* setup).

&#x200B;

Spent time in my local ER discussing discharge planning workflow considerations.

&#x200B;

Attended board meetings for new unit planning and coordinated with unit directors for ER, RT, and imaging for planning workflow difficulties.

&#x200B;

Sat in at my desk and drank a cup of french pressed coffee, occasionally looking out my office window at the rain, while listening to the lessons-learned debrief of a catastrophic process launch at a sister facility.

&#x200B;

Tackled about a half dozen of various break fixes across the facility in between projects.

&#x200B;

Saw really shitty cafeteria options on the menu and met a few coworkers at a local butchery to have coffee and sandwiches for an hour while discussing another project.

&#x200B;

I go to work when I wake up and leave when I feel I am done for the day. Sometimes that is 630am and sometimes it is 10. Sometimes I leave at 2 and sometimes I leave at 9pm. It depends on what is happening, but you could say 90% of the time it is 9-5.

&#x200B;

There isn't a department, system, or process that our two man team doesn't touch in the facility. You can be discussing procedure cost implementation with the CFO for a procedure area one minute and then over on med/surg troubleshooting a charting issue or providing education before going to a safety meeting to discuss planning against future issues. Last week I was in dietary watching their daily starting process to develop a plan to trim  and focus their initial organization for the day. You could be anywhere.

&#x200B;

It is the most badass job in healthcare, but you have to be motivated, somewhat personable, and willing to get your hands dirty. It is unbelievably eye opening to the machinations of health care and completely changes your perspective on... damn near everything. I absolutely LOVE IT and get antsy when I take a couple weeks off and miss work.

&#x200B;

It isn't for everyone, though. I am on call for over a week at a time, 24/7 for the entire city and work five days a week. The transition from 3 on four off was absolutely brutal and it took me almost two years to not feel like an absolute imposter. But once it clicked, damn, I know what I want to be when I grow up.

&#x200B;

I have seen work from home positions in the field, but they tend to skew very technical or very audit-heavy. The facility based positions have an excellent mix. Some are physician focused, some are technically focused, and some are nursing focused. There are several options and informatics means something different to every company.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long rant. NO ONE EVER ASKS ME WHAT MY JOB IS LIKE AND I AM EXCITED! I also realized I need to update my flair. Also, if you are a person that sees Joint Commission or CMS surveyors and suddenly provide an hour of very intensive, excellent care to the nearest patient (even if they aren't yours) please know that I feel you, but this may not be for you. When CMS came I was working with the c-suite, Quality, and unit directors to work on action plans had to be directly involved with the surveyors. If that sounds fulfilling to you- boom. Find out what system is launching in your facility and become a volunteer for implementing it. That gets your foot in the door. Then get experience and apply, apply, apply.

&#x200B;

Downsides:

On call sucks. Period. I don't know an informaticist that isn't on call to some extent. Our system specialists are on call 24/7, including vacation. That's rough. And calls suuuuuck the life out of you at 0200, but hey, you get paid *very well* for that time, on average. And you do it in your bathrobe on your couch.

&#x200B;

Dinner parties. No one ever asks the dreaded ""what's the worst thing you have ever seen?"" Your job isn't sexy to the layperson anymore and you will struggle for a long time just *describing* your job to people. I still default to ""nurse at a hospital."" Life is easier that way unless they seem genuinely curious. Then they tell you their daughter is a nurse. Every. Damn. Time.

&#x200B;

Becoming an outsider. When you go to a unit that is your background, and staff nurses talk down to you when you are trying to help them saying that you don't understand what they're going through, and they give you a hard time- that is probably the biggest issue i was warned about in my interviews. Once you're in slacks with polished shoes you are *one of them.* It wasn't as bad as I was let on to believe, but when it happens it is absolutely demoralizing. It sucks when you know how to and want to help someone and they won't let you. You have to accept that will happen and it isn't your job to correct them. It is your job to listen to why they're stressed, pressed for time, unwilling to talk- whatever the case, and turn it in to a problem that needs to be solved. It is both satisfying and stressful. And sometimes a little lonely.

&#x200B;

Friends. When you work in healthcare you surround yourself with people (or at least I did) that segment their life in A,B,C shifts, 48 hour blocks, or sets of 3 12s. Once you go 9-5 all of those friends, except the really good ones, tend to fade away. You make new friends, too, but the abrupt change in your social life will be a shock. 

&#x200B;

...and that's it. Some meetings can be boring, but the office culture schlock of ""couldn't that be an email"" doesn't really apply. The jobs you tackle could impact one person, one team, or an entire patient population for a year. You tend to get pulled in to meetings that match that level of responsibility and, honestly, it is refreshing to hear folks say ""I don't mean to waste your time, but can you please help me?"" rather than getting slapped in the face by a dirty catheter from Bethel at 4 in the morning because the jello on her tray was yellow, and she doesn't like yellow, but it is yellow and you remind her of her deadbeat nephew that went to jail once. Never forget."
nursing,ffavjeq,t1_ff9w0vk,1579745475.0,"Low hanging fruit and an obvious choice, sure, but I think there is more to it than that. For one, nursing clinicals are a huge pain in the ass to organize whereas paramedic clinicals and unit shadowing is more flexible. If I had to guess, I would think it stems heavily from the complexity of nursing clinical organization by comparison."
nursing,ffavb69,t1_ffav2mb,1579745326.0,"My cohort was \~80 and it was pretty well organized. However, my wife's school....fuck a duck. My friends that went through Paramedic school and later, nursing, said nursing was better. It's a crapshoot."
nursing,ffauluv,t1_ffao9xr,1579744855.0,"First step? If they call you and ask you to come in and you are not on call- say no. It is a complete sentence and absolutely appropriate. Do not tell them why. Do not answer questions. A firm no. As it is established you can't be tapped you get called less.

&#x200B;

Be wary of *any* position that has call advertised in the job description. The call expectations can and will change with staffing, as you have experienced. This is pretty universal. 

&#x200B;

Plus, procedure areas suck. They're repetitive and boring. Go to ICU. You get the acuity and complex patient histories, but with a static set of 12s.

&#x200B;

Good luck."

nursing,ffarfhs,t1_ffafgx4,1579742747.0,"What if I told you that burn out and turnover is, to some extent, by design? An old unit is an inflexible unit and a safety risk. Newer nurses are less expensive, more responsive to change, freshly educated, and increasingly coming out of the gate with higher degrees- opening the facility up to unit awards, grants, and magnet status. They also tend to be highly motivated, if a bit accident prone. But hey- accidents are fine. That is what RCA is for. Barring negligence, an adverse event is a *process* problem. Over time, those processes get better and you need flexible minds to adapt to the changes.

&#x200B;

Sucks for us old fucks, though. Find a job people hate doing on the unit and get really good at it."

nursing,ffaqduy,t1_ffagfal,1579742041.0,"You have to make time for breaks and establish early on that your time is your time.

Every nurse I have met that ""doesn't get lunch"" has the same hurried, breathless perspective on nursing. You either make your time or you don't. It is rarely an issue of the unit not having the opportunity, but rather the staff member prioritizing poorly and not trusting their judgement.

&#x200B;

Ask yourself- Will anyone die in the next 30 minutes? If the answer is no, then go to lunch and ask another nurse to call you if someone is dying. Don't ask other nurses to ""cover your section."" No one wants to handle double the patients and ""prepping"" your section so you don't feel guilty about handing off is a waste of time and bullshit. Stabilize your folks and get lunch. Get it early. Go before your unit's peak hours. Don't try to go in the last two hours of the shift. Hospitals are 24/7 and it will keep on without you. The unit will figure it out. If your unit has a problem with it, then tell them it wouldn't happen if they institute a lunch float with a sign up board.

Watching a patient bleed to death in front of you is hard when the family is refusing a transfusion, but the scenario is completely preventable. It is hard every time and navigating the ""are you sure"" tight rope is such a delicate skill- no one wants to be pushy with testing beliefs, but it is also our job to clearly outline *choice consequences* and be absolutely sure the patient understands what their choice means. A simple miscommunication or misunderstanding is a literal life or death scenario when dealing with tPA, methotrexate, blood transfusions, or intubatory/resuscitative care.

""The ONLY reason religious groups own hospitals is to impose their ideologies on other people's bodies directly. Disagree? ""

Your statement doesn't mean *anything*. What ideologies would they impose? Do you think the CEO or board of the hospital states that nurses, doctors, CNAs, chaplains, case managers, or respiratory techs need to go in to patient's rooms and spread the word of Jesus? Or do you mean, quite specifically, a hospital's perspective of abortion? To suggest that a religious group owns a hospital just to reduce or stop reproductive care as a generalization is absolutely absurd. Do you know how insignificant the number of people seeking that kind of care in the grand scheme of hospital care is? Did you know that hospitals start as religious non-profits because running a healthcare system is *risky* and *expensive?* Healthcare is staggeringly complex even when it is simple. Please just... stop.

nursing,fc59wtq,t1_fc3qcgh,1577450386.0,I'm so sorry.
nursing,fc59umq,t3_eg4xy5,1577450311.0,"The only self righteous nursing bullshit I have ever participated in and loved was the nurses playing cards bit. That may have been the most fun and hilarious roller coaster this subreddit has ever seen. And it was funny because Maureen Walsh, in her original context, was speaking about volume and time at critical access hospitals and, honestly, wasn't wrong if I lean on my experience. The ones I have worked at would have some busy days, sure, but most of the time was sheer downtime boredom. It helps that she sincerely apologized and *owned* the backlash with a sense of humor."
nursing,fc59hg4,t1_fc54gfn,1577449860.0,Oh.... oh my god.
nursing,fc59em5,t1_fc55kze,1577449759.0,"I felt that way for awhile, but if you think of the ER as a ""gateway"" to care where your only job is to screen fatal illness then it gets a lot easier to manage time and patients."
nursing,fc599uz,t1_fc4rl4y,1577449592.0,"I would always find a way to make it happen. ER is 24/7 and will be running whether you are there or not. If 50,000 other ERs around the world keeping ticking without you then so can that one.  


I would stress that to everyone I would train. Folks who can't take care of themselves can't take care of patients."
nursing,fc594tj,t1_fc4fnol,1577449413.0,"If she had left it at ""not enough"" then I could get behind it.  


I absolutely hate posts like this and they make me cringe as a nurse."
todayilearned,fbyok34,t1_fbylgwn,1577222215.0,It has happened before and I wouldn't be surprised if it is happening here. I would feel so much better about the story.
