Roko's body is straight-up better than May's, with more abilities, more features, and more nipples, and to get a similarly superior body would cost May a lot of money, which she can't afford partly because of all the repair costs for her current crappy body.

Hopefully Roko's campaign will be a success and May can get a new and improved body that isn't falling apart, but the more fundamental issue of better bodies being available to those who can afford them is still there."

Finn the defecting stormtrooper rejecting his years of indoctrination, rediscovering his humanity, and encouraging others to do the same could have been great.
