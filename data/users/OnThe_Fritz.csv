By definition, it has been cooked well beyond where any of the qualities of the original food still exist. It's like completely burning roast veggies and serving them because you don't think its an issue. It is, because they are burnt, and no-one tasting them next to non  burned roast veggies would choose the burnt ones. You've screwed them up. 

Likewise, the reason chefs hate well-done is because you are literally asking them to burn and incorrectly cook one of the better items in the restaurant. You say ""they should expect a steak that is cooked differently to accommodate the fact that it is being prepared differently,"" but differently in this case just means wrong. No chef can magically make a well-done steak that still retains any flavor or juiciness, and to someone who appreciates food it is honestly painful to see it happen.

Honestly, just try a mid-rare with an open mind next time and pay attention to the differences. We're all just trying to help you."

TheExpanse,fdrrtha,t1_fdrpof8,1578688807.0,"Exactly my feeling. Ashford has been around so long, it seems like he would immediately know he was going to die either way. He would have at least taken out Marco rather than just give up. Hell, the whole lead up sort of made it seem like he wasn't planning on coming back, why would he balk at the last moment?"

trees,fdp6vml,t1_fdnwcuc,1578621390.0,"Definitely BLM, almost definitely NOT national park land. I'm sure it has happened, but national parks are easily the most trafficked and managed of public lands, and rangers are a very outdoorsy bunch who typically have a sense of stewardship over the land. Except in the most remote/undeveloped parks I doubt there are many grows. BLM/Forest Service/BIA most definitely though"
science,fdp6b88,t1_fdnozz2,1578621015.0,"I totally agree. On a side note, last month I went to PR for the first time, and had so much good food!! I can definitely see how it is an adjustment from typical US fare, but god damn, do people eat well there. Mofongo sounded like the weirdest thing until I had some, now all I want is to find some plantains to try making it myself. And the empanadillos!!! Soooo good"
todayilearned,fdp4jys,t1_fdoy6ab,1578619835.0,It's because they still actually cook and have often had thousands of years or culinary development. The US is a toddler stuffing it's face with applesauce by comparison.
