insomnia,ffk3grc,t3_eu0go4,1580014642.0,Get away from that GP to a new doctor or even a psychiatrist.   If you’ve had to quit your job this is extremely  serious. The sleep diary is to verify that you’re reporting real sleep disturbances.   Look for someone that does CBT-I cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia.

BeAmazed,ffjy6e6,t1_ffjx9ai,1580010197.0,"And you’re clearly misunderstanding the role of service dogs in autism support and what the person you were responding to was looking for.  Service dogs can provide emotional support tasks - line in this video.  The difference is “task” vs “makes me feel better.”   
As long as the dog is providing a trained response to a state of being deemed medically necessary it’s a service animal.  The commenter realized a dog like the one pictured could help her with her autism.  You attempted to rain on that by making a semantic distinction that clearly didn’t need to be made in this instance.  

If you’d bothered to look, for autism, support dogs include things like “providing openings for social interaction” as well as responding by alerting to various emotional states.  Service dogs for autism do many tasks that could, in the absence of the autism diagnosis, be considered “emotional support.”  I understand this about autism and sought to correct any doubt for the poster that she could indeed have a service dog."
