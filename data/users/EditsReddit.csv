gamemaker,femcef5,t1_fekpzbk,1579248427.0,"Sorry for the late reply, caught up with IRL things.

I think that's where the issue is - o\_turret and o\_player shouldn't be different objects. Merge them into one and try from the beginning. Message me if you need a hand with this process!

I used to do turret object and main object as separate things, but I realised how much more EFFORT it is to keep them both moving together."

SmashBrosUltimate,fekkc1s,t1_fekjcxv,1579201848.0,"Look, I think you're getting to worked up over this. I disagree with the semantics over text, but to saying it's ""fucking retarded"" and to over-analyse someone saying they don't like the character is too far. 

To write paragraphs about the minute differences in word choice, not to the original poster but to a commenter shows you don't want a conversation, you just want to shout.

I'm willing to talk about Byleth and the announcement, but not if you're going to make sweeping generalizations about someone you don't know."
SmashBrosUltimate,fekj1tq,t1_fekgqwb,1579201075.0,"But the comment you replied to just said ""People (me included)"" which you followed with ""Plenty of people"" and ""Tons of people"" - it's the same language they used. 

Sure, there is diverse opinions, so why are you assuming the original poster was even saying they spoke for the majority? At no point did they say that, just as you said you didn't.

If you're sick of it, take a breather from the computer, come back with a clearer mind and don't assume everyone has the worst of intentions."

gamemaker,fej8kzc,t1_fej4v7o,1579161557.0,"Sure, custom predicted direction in the script though has an origin point - if you're spawning from oTurret, it will lag slightly behind oPlayer as they are two different objects. The problem IS overshooting and I think that 1 frame of lag might be causing the issue.

If you're not spawning the bullets at the origin x/y, then the script will need that new origin point. Change the code so instead of origin.x and origin.y, it receives the true x and y spawning point.

Long and short - combine the two objects into one, make the turret part of the draw script. Then, give the true x and y coords and try again.  You said the movement code is above, but ""just some speed and direction"" is vague - you may have made a easy to make error, such as an increasing or decreasing speed modifer, which will mess intercept\_course up.

If you're still having issues with spawning bullets where you want, look into length\_dir, which can be used to work out the length of barrels on turrets for spawning, but that is pretty advanced so if needed, I will make a longer write up."
AOWPlanetFall,fej37pi,t3_enqnv5,1579155207.0,"Feel like I'm going against the grain but ... I really didn't enjoy AOW3. It's fairly cheap though, so try it for yourself! There's a load of content, but I feel the gameplay improvements in Planetfall are leaps and bounds above AOW3."
gamemaker,feh918v,t1_feh3rn5,1579111656.0,"First things first, make sure your movement code is before your firing code, else you may be firing from a position you're no longer at. Secondly, from where is the bullet spawning? On the x and y, or at the tip of the turret?

You could do something like ... make scr\_turret\_direction.

This 'new' script will return the direction your turret should be before firing.

scr\_turret\_direction(projectileSpeed, target, x, y);

    var projectileSpeed = argument0;
    var target          = argument1;
    var alpha, beta, phi, newTurretDirection;
    
    newTurretDirection = point_direction(argument2, argument3, target.x,target.y);
    
    alpha = target.speed / projectileSpeed;
    
    beta = degtorad(target.direction - newTurretDirection);
    
    phi = alpha * sin(beta);
    
    if (abs(phi) >= 1) {  return (-1); }
    
    newTurretDirection += radtodeg(arcsin(phi));
    
    return newTurretDirection;

Then, this'll be what your turret should point towards, then spawn the bullets from what I assume is your adjusted spawning point? What's happening in your current code is it's overshooting just a tad, which I believe to be from not spawning at the x and y position.

Without seeing the code, I can only speculate, but hopefully this helps."
gamemaker,fegznc3,t3_ep4b08,1579106058.0,"Mind explaining what you mean by ""double pre fire"" ?

Nor the turret part - what do you want it to do? What is it doing instead?

EDIT: Also, lets see the intercept\_course script in your code, along with the bullet code, that'll help isolate the issue."

todayilearned,fdp4yl5,t1_fdp3a84,1578620104.0,"Most places have a corner store here, along with compact towns and cities with very few people comparatively - most richer people live further out, thus mandates a milkman. 

With the distance to dairy farms being incredibly short as well, often the diary does one loop, dropping off milk to all the stores in villages or towns, which then are the fresh milk hub - then milkmen will pick up from there. 

With smaller villages, often these stores become the only hub for everything basically - General store + post office + bakery + fresh milk. Whether or not a milkman works there is simple - how many rich people are in driving distance?"

Yet, there's still milkmen, just less of them... it's such a bizzare scenario."

I know though, you want a cool name for the conflict, so expand it - World Wars involve the world, but Xenos invading? That's a system war. Or Solar System war? Maybe go with a dramatized name spread by news outlets at the time - When the aliens invaded, their ships blocked the light out if sun ... so began THE WAR OF THE SUN!

Go dramatic or go descriptive!"
