See, I can make totally stupid arguments just like you! Your entire argument is that you're allowed to pass judgement because you've decided what's right and what's not, but no one else is.

The current Chief Marketing Officer came from Revlon and Coca Cola before that, whereas Mads worked his way up through the ranks of Lego before becoming CMO. The current situation of shrinking part count vs. rising price is definitely what I would expect from a former Coke executive.  

Mads left in May 2016, no doubt everything for 2017 was underway by then, so it makes sense that the recent changes that people have noticed are the result of Julia Goldin taking over the position."
