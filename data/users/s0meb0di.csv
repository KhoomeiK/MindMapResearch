AskReddit,ffeu9dl,t1_ffeswu5,1579865795.0,"Probably. The vast majority of the world's population doesn't think before they speak, if at all.

Of course not. But if it was because of the confusion, I would, likely, feel differently about it if I was in the author's shoes."
AskReddit,ffeh7n8,t1_ffecggt,1579847887.0,Weren't they just confusing you with an immigrant from one of central countries?
AskReddit,ffean6s,t1_ffdqj3w,1579841400.0,"I don't get you about not being called Russian. If you are not ethnically Russian, do you want to be called Russian (ethnic)? Why? If you are talking about being a resident of Russia, I was never called ""Russian"" in that meaning too, even though I am ethnically Russian. It's just not what people say.

For people who don't know Russian language:
There are two words: ""Russkiy"" and ""Rossiyanin"". The first means the ethnicity, the second one - citizenship. Kind of like ""English"" and ""British""."
unpopularopinion,ferx5m8,t1_fers8j6,1579359260.0,"It depends what you are donating for. When I donate to the charity or feed a homeless person (which I do, unlike you are suggesting) I want to actually help people. I don't want them staying on the streets, I want them living in normal life. Giving them money which they will likely spend (at least partially) on alcohol doesn't help to get them off the streets. And in cold winters here, it's outright life threatening, a lot of homeless people die of hypothermia, because they were trying to warm up with alcohol (myth) and fell asleep drunk.

Also, the money you give them will be much better spent, if you donate them to any charity. We all have a limited amount of money, consider how you are spending them.

Nobody has the power to decide how people spend their money. Suggesting and educating isn't deciding."
unpopularopinion,ferjndt,t1_fer60fk,1579354743.0,"If you want to help the poor, donate to special charities, which actually help people get off the streets."
unpopularopinion,feqyovt,t1_feqy1iw,1579347581.0,"At least it never makes the situation worse, like giving them money often does."
unpopularopinion,fepc9bt,t1_feniqlc,1579316991.0,"Ehm, give them food then, not money."
unpopularopinion,fepc153,t1_fenfsmo,1579316839.0,"If they are going to continue to drink, they won't get off the streets. Most people don't become homeless because of addictions, but a lot of them get addicted on the streets. At least that's the way where I live. I remember the head of a large homeless helping charity saying that giving homeless people money is pointless and, often, distructive."
trashy,fem8tcj,t1_fejl71b,1579243977.0,"I delivered these in Denmark, when I was a student there. They came in packages for each apartment. There was a link on the package, which lead to their website, where you could choose which adds you wanted (like an IKEA catalogue) and which you didn't want. Neat system."
facepalm,fem8bdi,t1_fejxt75,1579243412.0,"I bet the metal part is the same. It looks like the one on my grandpa's Octavia. If you loose/break a Porsche key, it's probably cheaper to get s vw replacement key."
facepalm,fem84n9,t1_fejzlue,1579243207.0,"Sure, nobody ever cheaps out on a replacement part for a cheap car."
europeanunion,feiqcyp,t1_fei88jy,1579144582.0,"But they have speakers in the phone, so they must have a dac. This whole thing is one big ""WTF""."
facepalm,feiq1p9,t1_fegakdg,1579144367.0,*if cars didn't crumple you would need huge airbags.
facepalm,feipygz,t1_fegadtm,1579144307.0,"No, this isn't a crumple zone. If cars crumpled that easily, imagine what would happen in a 60 kmph collision. In this case, the pole hit to the side of all the safety structures, where there are only mounts for decorative panels."
AskReddit,fe1srj6,t1_fe1rzrh,1578830413.0,"OK, soft plastic bottles like platypus weigh 3 times less than an ""ultralight"" nalgene and can hold hot water."
AskReddit,fe1qskl,t1_fe1oamk,1578829777.0,"Because your sleeping bag should be enough to keep you warm, that's what I meant.

True, but a chair or a full pillow add comfort. Blatantly saving every possible gram is dumb. One should evaluate the comfort/weight ratio of an item. The problem with these bottles is that, it seems to me, there is practically no added comfort in using them, there are lighter alternatives that do the same."
AskReddit,fe1ne6w,t1_fe1m5i5,1578828692.0,"But that means you fucked up planning your trip and took the wrong equipment with you. Plan better -> pack lighter -> go further, quicker and easier.

P.S. edited the original comment."
AskReddit,fe0vifo,t1_fe0crhz,1578819172.0,It is highly unlikely.
Wellthatsucks,fdzyjbc,t1_fdw9l1g,1578798919.0,I saw a video of a semi vaporizing a pickup truck a few years ago. It still gives ne nightmares. Especially because everything was normal just a few seconds before the accident.
AskReddit,fdzxe7a,t1_fdzfupp,1578798123.0,"But you don't need something that durable while hiking. Yoy can make a very durable tent that will weigh 20 kg, but nobody needs it.

Edit: a nalgene bottle weighs 5 times as much as a regular PET bottle. If you are so concerned, take a spare PET bottle.

IdiotsInCars,fdzvfcy,t1_fdy615d,1578796728.0,"I was going like 15 km/h when the throttle got stuck, pressed the brake as hard as possible, stopped in like 15 meters, after going over a rock (probably denting the subframe). So it doesn't always work. Electronic accelerator pedal car, by the way."
IdiotsInCars,fdzusot,t1_fdzoaad,1578796297.0,My 2007 (first year of production) Mitsubishi had a very hard time overcoming the engine.
Whatcouldgowrong,fdg0pzf,t1_fdg00g8,1578375819.0,"Links? Those that I can find are mostly  videos from Asia, and thr vast majority  of pieces  from CIS countries  are drunk people or actual  accidents. 

There are also videos of people jumping out of windows for no reason (not suicide), it doesn't mean they are trying to scam anyone."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdfzryk,t1_fdei952,1578374936.0,"I've lived in Russia for almost all my life, this is absolute bullshit. Most courts will give a pedestrian like 500 USD compensation, and good luck getting that from like 50% of the population. Dashcams are popular because of good advertising and bribable police officers, who can make you the guilty party in an accident."
Whatcouldgowrong,fdfz6n1,t1_fdfj5li,1578374401.0,"Yeah, but it's not the fraud everyone on reddit talks about. You crash an expensive car, do an ""independent"" repair cost evaluation 3-10 times the actual repair cost. Repair the car for the lowest possible price, split the money between you, the ""expert"" and the insurance agent. The vast majority of people have only basic liability insurance, which has low coverage limits."
IdiotsInCars,fblom19,t1_fbdvzg8,1576966301.0,"There are horizontal traffic lights in St.Petersburg, at Dalnevostochniy/Narodnaya intersection, for example.

Most are vertical, sure."
