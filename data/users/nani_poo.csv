Yea, the Too Faced one always felt odd on my lips. Plus it was so pricy for very little product. The buxom glosses are huge!"
PanPorn,ff94ihj,t1_ff946tu,1579704650.0,It‚Äôs actually a gel powder! I have a LED machine at home & just ordered colourful chrome gel powders off amazon for cheap!
PanPorn,ff7ra68,t3_es4mid,1579656442.0,"Too Faced Lip Injection Extreme. Worked for 3-5 hours on the lips. Smelled so bad! Would not be buying this (or any other Too Faced products) again.

Does anyone recommend a better lip plumper gloss?"

curlyhair,fe64f4i,t3_enxfcq,1578881550.0,"Routine:

I wash my hair 1-2 times a week depending if I went to the gym a lot that week.

The shampoos I use are Proclaim Shea Butter shampoo or Silk Elements Luxury moisturizing shampoo. When I shampoo i use a Maxsolf shampoo brush to get ride of any build up. I tend to get dandruff the 3rd day after washing day.

For conditioner I use Shea Moisture Jamican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore masque or Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil masque.

I use a comb to detangle my hair, then put Marc Anthony 100% Coconut Oil & Shea Butter curl cream. Run that through my hair with my fingers, then scrunch the product in. 

I plop my hair in a microfiber towel & let it air-dry. My hair takes 5-6 hours to dry naturally."

drugstoreMUA,fcu4718,t3_eiuey3,1577972126.0,"Yay for asexual representation! As a demisexual (spectrum of asexuality) this makes me happy!
For grey eyeshadow a little trick is to mix more than one shade of it. Having one grey is lovely, but when you add an extra three types of grey, it makes the look have so much more dimension!"
