Though things picked up after the impeachment. It's around 10% now. 

The more important concept is that the stock markets aren't the entire economy. They're just people buying and selling ownership in various companies. The companies might legitimately be adding value to the economy. But all the people who by and sell shares care about is the return on their personal investment. Which has got nothing to do with how healthy those companies actually are. This isn't totally bad. If you have a retirement account the company handling it will be buying and selling shares (and other financial instruments like government bonds) in order to maximise your growth.

But the problem is that corporations are required to maximise returns for their investors. So a CEO might see that share price growth is slow. He can either use Trump's massive tax breaks to invest in a new division that might be profitable in five or ten years time. Or he could buy shares back from investors increasing demand (and therefore share price) and make it appear that the companies value is growing.

 Investors are happy because their shares are more profitable. The board is happy because investors are happy. The CEO is happy because the board is happy. And workers have gone ten years without a meaningful wage increase and having their overtime be capped because paying workers fairly doesn't increase share prices."
