PoliticalDiscussion,fee0oba,t1_feawqd9,1579023931.0,"I checked on this more because I was wondering if they would just be skipped if they don't meet the requirements, but there is a sentence in the 12th amendment that says VP does have to meet all of the requirements (""But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States""). However for other positions in the line of succession they don't have to meet them all, they would just be skipped. For example, Elaine Chao (Fun fact: Mitch McConnell's wife) is 14th in line being the Sec of Transportation, but she was born in Taiwan and isn't a natural born citizen, so if it ever made it down to her it would just skip to the next person."
PoliticalDiscussion,fee08s2,t1_fecnxb2,1579023644.0,"It came up before Cruz as well. John McCain was born in Panama on a military base. 2008 was interesting for birth place because both people running were born outside the continental US (Hawaii for Obama, not Kenya)."
PoliticalDiscussion,fedxvhb,t1_feamopi,1579022195.0,"If she wins this year she would be the oldest person ever elected to a first term, only Reagan's second term and Trump's first have elected someone 70 or older. A run in 2028 would make her older than Bernie and Biden now. Women live longer, but that is too old for President (I also think Biden, Bernie, and Trump are too old to be running this time and Warren is arguably too old)."
politics,fedt2q4,t1_fedo5by,1579019297.0,Because there is no reason to assume only $10 million when including any form of returns. The point was he has an obscene amount of money. My original comment was that even doing the worst possible thing for the money by keeping it under a very large mattress (ignoring investing in stuff that tanks in value) still required him to either spend more than $10 million a year or live over 10 years longer than the current record.
politics,feclj6m,t1_fecegar,1578976886.0,"Yeah, 23.2 million is a 4% withdrawal rate, which is usually low enough to never run out. But I assumed they were talking about just having it in cash."

politics,febx2o1,t1_febo05s,1578963716.0,"Most states aren't going to be very competitive (South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Dakotas kind of states are all going to be Republican, California, New York, Hawaii and similar are always going to be Democratic) so generally they only campaign in the swing states that could go either way (Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania are some of the bigger ones) since the electoral college is winner take all for each state (besides Nebraska and Maine).

Basically it is the same how the Labour party isn't going to be putting much time towards the areas outside cities and Conservative aren't paying as much attention to a lot of London."
southcarolina,fe9mzxj,t1_fe9he1q,1578939581.0,"They lost my business forever when they did the Halloween commercials that started with a super loud scream like 6-8 years ago (they did them again this year too, maybe other years). Scared the crap out of me when it started right after I had been listening to a song really loud. I might have been more lenient if it was just the annoying part.

Also, they don't come up with the commercials or at least not all the time. I was in Tennessee in early 2015 and heard the exact same commercial as the one they were doing here, except it was for a different dealership."

MurderedByWords,fe6geb6,t1_fe6fzud,1578890101.0,Lee Carter is a state rep and irrelevant to anything to do with the initial conversation about anything Sanders can accomplish with the assistance of Congress. No Kentucky seats were flipped as both Senators are Republican and the only Democratic house member has been there since 2007. All the Democratic that flipped a Republican seat in 2018 were moderates.

facepalm,fdpopm4,t1_fdpc737,1578634874.0,"Because I meant 63. For signed numbers it is one less. If it is unsigned it is 64 (the max amount of RAM you can have in a 32 bit computer is 2^32 (4.28 billion, or 4GB) and 2^64 in a 64 bit (basically unlimited for right now)."
moderatepolitics,fdpbpp1,t1_fdpa29c,1578624636.0,"Ah, I hadn't ever seen that way of doing odds, I just barely understand the stuff with like -300 or +200. So you basically should be making like $10 for almost no risk?"
facepalm,fdpbdli,t1_fdp3ih5,1578624401.0,"Some extra explanation is that 32 bit signed numbers can go to 2^31 before doing something called overflow. It is 31 because one of the bits is to signify if it is positive or negative. 2^31 is about 2.14 billion (if you ever played runescape this number may sound familiar because of the same reason). That many seconds from 1970 is in 2038 (1 billion seconds is 30 something years). After it gets to the last possible number it will overflow and basically go to the first number, which is negative 2.14 billion, when would basically make the date think it is ~1902 or something.

Year 2038 problem on Wikipedia has some more information. It really shouldn't be an issue by then since we are already mostly using 64 bit (can go to 2^61, which is massively larger), but some lazy programmers will definitely still cause some issues, just hopefully not on anything too important."
facepalm,fdpamv3,t1_fdp11kh,1578623899.0,"Yeah, there should be almost no issues by then. Problem will be getting the super old systems updated since I'm not sure much effort it would take to change some old banking software that was written in the 80s to 64 bit. People already make lots of money supporting these systems since they are written in Fortran or Cobal or something else few people know. So I'm sure there will be a few people making a huge amount when something inevitably is missed."

I've never flown Spirit, but I have Frontier and I liked them better than AA/United (Never flown Delta and I like Southwest more than Frontier). But when we flew Frontier we had 1 checked bag and paid extra so my wife and I could sit together. Didn't get anything on the flight besides basic drinks (Can't remember if only water was free or not), but we don't care about that.
