worldnews,fe3p1n4,t1_fe39t1g,1578851505.0,Sure but of those that did 3 million more people voted for someone else yet here we are with this asshat as president. Not exactly a fair system with the electoral college in place. CA gives more money to the federal government yet Californian votes count less than peoples in other states. Seems like the Feds are just using the state as a cash cow while hating everything about them. They're obviously doing something right if they're able to provide so much to the federal government.

They also get to go home after they murder people doing no wrong doing. Whether sitting in front of a store, or watching tv eating ice cream on their own couch, or even just playing games at home with their nephew, people get murdered and the cops always get to  go home. You can be off duty and shoot people in the back after you get embarrassed by a retard. Then they let you go back to the store the next day to view the footage of your murder and two attempted murders before you say anything on record. Police don't save people from shit."

news,fclzhya,t1_fcls8t1,1577760312.0,"Eh, you're right. Their names should be public because they were trained by the state to work in a field where their identity would be known if they actually got to keep their job anyway. 

On the other hand we could also say, these people were trained in law enforcement and therefore should face no penalty for this disgusting behavior because they're only doing as they were trained. Police get away with breaking nearly every law written so why shouldn't these people also be able get away with terrible behavior that isn't illegal for anyone else. State sponsored terrorism of the general populous by law enforcement is never really penalized so why start now?"

news,fclcd13,t1_fckrboi,1577744551.0,White cops have been hating blacks for generations. This is nothing new. Rodney King was severely beaten and left permanently disabled by racist cops in the 90's and it was happening long before that too. In the 90's there were riots nation wide when racist Simi Valley residents determined it's acceptable for police to beat black folks no problem. They were definitely judged by a jury of their racist peers.

NoStupidQuestions,fcaxbwm,t1_fcajqk1,1577578468.0,"Cops don't check cops IDs though. If the fake cop looks like a cop, a real cop would victimize you along side the fake cop until they realize anything is wrong. Cops don't defend innocent people from other cops. Cops shoot at innocent people often enough that we'd have footage by now if a cop was to open fire on another cop that was trying to murder innocent people. It's just not something they do."

NoStupidQuestions,fcawe08,t1_fcaef4v,1577577929.0,"Yeah then the real cop you failed to stop for is raging pissed off that you didn't stop and adds a bunch of charges to ruin your life. They're control freaks and when you start off by doubting they're authority you aren't gonna have a good time. 

Cops truly believe a person with their hands near their waist is a threat to their life. Yet they literally approach you with their hand at their waist ready to murder you and you're supposed to not feel threatened at the very same action they'll murder you over without hesitation out of ""fear for their lives""."
NoStupidQuestions,fcavqec,t1_fcap31w,1577577557.0,"Cops can literally murder and get no punishment. Yet somehow you think if a not cop murders someone that a real cop may be held liable? That's not how it works in USA. How old are you? Cops can arrive to the seen of a crime and shoot 9 innocent people and then charge the actual perpetrator with shooting 9 people. I think you're sadly mistaken about police liability and responsibility and it could cost you your life. Be old, white, and rich to avoid this or wise up."
