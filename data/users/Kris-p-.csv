I never got any refunds on things I downloaded when I was into mobile gaming, so when a game blatantly lied about its gameplay and I didn't want to pay money for it, I was SOOL.

I guess now they have a paid and free version of most apps, so that kind of fills the demo option."

The thing is he uses the claw to stun enemies, but he also uses the boomerang for that. And when he uses the claw, he has to stand still, vs using the boomerang and being allowed to move around when it's active.

If he's going to use it to traverse, like grabbing a vine, that kind of ruins the platforming aspect of mario, but idk that's just my opinion. It could still work for all I know"
