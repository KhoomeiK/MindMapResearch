I don't know enough about IBS to make a much of a comment about your situation, but the most important thing is that you do what you need to to be healthy, and if fibre causes you problems, then veganism is going to be exceptionally hard for you.

TopMindsOfReddit,fegbc24,t1_fefijjs,1579086096.0,"Are you aware that about 90% of amazon deforestation is to grow crops to feed farm animals? More plants are grown to feed farm animals than to feed humans. Most of that is soy and corn. Eating plants is more energy efficient, because you skip one pert of the food chain. Not farming animals would actually give us more food, not less. 

It only takes a small amount of food to feed one chicken in its lifetime because its killed at about 18 months old. 

That being said, chickens aren't the main problem, it's cows. They eat a fuck ton of food. 

If a person were to not supliment the nutrients from meat, the average person would only need to eat meat 2/3 meals a week. We don't need nearly as much protein as people think we do. 

Going vegan obviously won't solve all the problems, but it will at the very least dramatically slow down deforestation."
