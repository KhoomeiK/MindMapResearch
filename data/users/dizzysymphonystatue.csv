Adoption,fcxq3bk,t1_fcxichj,1578068788.0,"Somewhat chance, yeah. My parents had a lot of say in what sort of baby they wanted (down to known family medical history), so it does feel like a selection to me in my case. Parents are not forced to accept the first child that becomes available. If there was something innately undesirable about us, we could have been turned down. That's how I think about it, but my way isn't gospel.

When is ""your day""? I was adopted in the early 90s.

That was a good second paragraph/you really talked yourself through some good truths, there."
bipolar,fcxctmn,t3_ejdj3l,1578059440.0,"My psychiatrist told me, after my first (psychotic) manic crash, to get all of the sleep I felt I needed - be that 7 hours or 10 hours. There is a limit/you probably shouldn't be in bed for 12 consecutive hours, but sleep is necessary for your recuperation - even if that means you sleep for 9 hours and take a 3 hour nap later in the day. Do what you must to feel rested.

Mania has a tendency to keep us sleep-deprived - this on top of the depression which follows, demanding sleep. Your brain was on fire and needs to convalesce. Your brain recharges during sleep. Sleep as much as you need.

When you have recuperated following mania and when you're (likely) battling depression, you should be sleeping 7 to 8 hours every night at minimum. Too much more inflames depression. Less tempts mania. Good luck."
bipolar,fcxcgfi,t3_ejeq0y,1578059129.0,"Alcohol is something I gravitate towards when I am having an episode: depressive, mixed or manic. Particularly manic or mixed. It has the deceptive effect of making me feel good or better at first, then making me feel awful. It's not a useful tool and I seek to avoid alcohol in all quantities due to my unhealthy relationship with it (i.e., drinking when I'm in a mood state and not otherwise) and medicines."

Sort of a kitschy title but the information is very academic. Invaluable to me and addresses practically every topic you can think of. Thorough.

As-for personal reading, a subscription to [Bipolar Hope](https://www.bphope.com) magazine is useful; [The Gorilla and The Bird](https://smile.amazon.com/Gorilla-Bird-Memoir-Madness-Mothers/dp/0316315125/ref=sr_1_1?crid=145GJAPEJQHMS&keywords=the+gorilla+and+the+bird&qid=1578058817&sprefix=the+gorilla+%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-1) is a well-done contemporary anecdote (written by a former attorney); [An Unquiet Mind](https://smile.amazon.com/Unquiet-Mind-Memoir-Moods-Madness/dp/0679763309/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=an+unquiet+mind&qid=1578058874&sr=8-2) is a staple of the field due to the author's qualifications as a psychologist with Bipolar Disorder Type I and success at living-well."
Adoption,fcxbbv3,t3_ejc5ef,1578058149.0,"So, I never struggled with the feeling my bio-parents simply didn't love me (although in the case of my birthfather, that might have been true). I always figured the statistics were these two people who created a baby were unfit to care for it. When I met them, this was also confirmed.

My birthmother was 16 when she had me and my birthfather was an absolute tool. She was too young to care for me and was going to have no help from a second parent to boot, so, she placed me for adoption. My adoptive parents (i.e., my mom and dad) are wonderful.  


Birthmom turned out to be an addict and birthdad is unstable. Both are unstable, really. They, too, did me a favor by placing me for adoption.  


As for your feelings of inadequacy, they are normal. I began therapy at the age of fifteen (I'm still in therapy for other reasons) and uncovered a ""fear of abandonment"" (I think I've mostly grown out of) as a result of my adoption. It changes you somewhere along the way, being adopted. In your case, they have affected your feelings of value. I would suggest visiting a counselor for a session or two (or however long you need) regarding these feelings. 

Best of luck. You have worth and you are so valuable people chose you. Imagine that."
Adoption,fcxayo8,t3_ej7zez,1578057818.0,"As an adopted adult who knew from an early age and met their birth family, ""mom"" is who raised me. Period. My mother also felt threatened by the now second-mom I had when I met my birthmother, however she had no reason to be. I could have never felt the same way about biology as the woman who spent her life keeping me alive.

Your feelings are natural, but I'd try not to worry. You will always be mom."

bipolar,fck292j,t3_ehlqg2,1577714393.0,"The criteria for hypomania is not as sever as mania and is traditionally followed by depressive crashes. Are your periods of increased energy followed by depressive troughs? If so, you might be Bipolar II. I'm super not-a-doctor, but it's entirely possible. 

Was the Effexor/Lithium combination effective?

Second opinions never hurt anyone. Therapists can also help with the diagnostic process. I will state this: starting on Lithium rather than a first or second generation antipsychotic seems fast. Lithium is very effective but I believe starting on a medication not resulting in immediate need for blood tests is more common."

bipolar,fck1jjx,t3_ehjw83,1577713743.0,"Hypersexuality is a hallmark of Bipolar Disorder, affecting men and women. Your boyfriend may be experiencing this - mildly or severely - during episodes. Those who write he is just ""an ass"" are undereducated about the power this disease can truly have over our behaviors (source: Suzy Favor Hamilton and Robert Lowell - famous Bipolar patients who experienced hypersexuality and unfaithful behaviors).  


As for your boyfriend's ability to control his hypersexuality and the expectation you put up with it: there are rules you two can put in place - hard lines - that will keep his hot-and-cold behaviors in check,  
and his experiencing this as a symptom does **not** mean you are required to put up with it. This road is not for everyone, symptom-by-symptom. Good luck."
