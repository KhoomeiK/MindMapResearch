GetMotivated,fffvz6f,t1_fffv1pw,1579893000.0,"Yea I get that, but I don‚Äôt think that is what this image is trying to convey. The cat sees itself as something much bigger than it is, so that becomes its reality. If it was a human, than because that is their reality then they would not try to improve themselves. This can apply to most people. I think the message is that we must try to stay close to reality, and not fall into these delusions. This image can have many different meanings but this is my interpretation."

CPTSDmemes,felupi8,t1_felsd8f,1579231399.0,"Yea weed is really trippy, it‚Äôs no surprise. It has psychedelic properties. There is a big difference in tripping on weed and tripping on psychedelics. It is very hard to understand but man, tripping on shrooms has let me leave behind my trauma and love myself. The extent of healing that it gave me was so amazing it‚Äôs almost unbelievable. Tripping on mushrooms is way less anxiety inducing than smoking weed, although it is more intense due to the fact that you‚Äôre actually hallucinating. But if you do it right, those hallucinations are so healing and loving. When I took shrooms I felt a mother‚Äôs love coming from the universe almost telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôs all gonna be okay‚Äù. And that helped me more than any therapy ever did. Tripping on weed is super scary but in the right set and setting, mushrooms are amazing and healing.

Tripping is something that should be done outside. It‚Äôs hard to explain but trust me when I say you don‚Äôt want to be tripping in some office with a doctor you barely know. If you ever decide to do it, do it with someone that is very close to you or that you love, and sit outside and admire the beauty of nature. Mushrooms will make you appreciate nature so so much because it opens your mind to how incredible this life is."
CPTSDmemes,fels4ac,t1_felrzdp,1579229573.0,"I disagree that it‚Äôs a terrible idea to take mushrooms without a doctor. I think I would freak out if I was tripping with a doctor, that‚Äôs cause I‚Äôve done it before and I know the right setting to have fun, which is with close friends and being outside. That said, it‚Äôs definitely not for everyone."
CPTSDmemes,felrevc,t1_felqu7u,1579229095.0,"Im so sorry I feel really bad, no one should have to deal with that. Have you ever tried taking mushrooms?
