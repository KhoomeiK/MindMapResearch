The cat sees itself as something much bigger than it is, so that becomes its reality. If it was a human, than because that is their reality then they would not try to improve themselves. This can apply to most people. I think the message is that we must try to stay close to reality, and not fall into these delusions. This image can have many different meanings but this is my interpretation."

Youâ€™re just being a general asshat by being salty and talking politics on a comment that was a joke, you look like a dumbass here. Not only that but right after saying â€œam I being hateful?â€ You go ahead and called me fried. So yes, yes you are. You sound really ignorant and I think you could use a blunt or two."

Buddy youâ€™re literally describing yourself right now. Unlike you I actually keep to the facts and I can clearly see that some terrorist for a president is clearly not the right fit. Sorry, but I donâ€™t want my president telling people to grab women by their pussies. Itâ€™s common sense. Your hate has no place here, get that shit outta here."

If you always blame your depression for everything you will continue to be depressed.

Iâ€™m doing things with my life now although I used to be extremely depressed. I still feel it come back sometimes but I can actually deal with it now that I have other things going on so that I can forget about it and make myself busy."
trees,fenhb6e,t3_eq1b8b,1579284681.0,Lol Iâ€™m getting really tired of the whole â€œboomerâ€ label being used to generalize a whole generation into being hardcore ignorant republicans. We should just call these people retards.
Dabs,fenh45i,t1_fengsc7,1579284561.0,"Dude I was clearly joking around but youâ€™re bringing politics into this, and also acting like an asshat, so of course that makes you look like a salty trumpie boy.

I used to always get negative loops before tripping and now I see that thoughts are not actually me, so I can just ignore them and watch them pass by. Itâ€™s quite peaceful. The only thing bugging me is how dissociated I feel cause I have dp/dr and it makes me always think about death and life, and Iâ€™m really scared of both. Iâ€™m scared about what Iâ€™m part of. I feel like I should trip again because itâ€™s been a while, it always lets me find peace In just being some monkey soul in space."

CPTSDmemes,fem73bp,t1_fem5ite,1579242104.0,"I get that it works but that doesnâ€™t make it safe. It just changes chemicals in your brain. Psychedelics change your perspective and are healthy. Your opinion isnâ€™t right, especially since youâ€™ve never even tried a psychedelic. Itâ€™s one of those things that you canâ€™t even imagine unless you do it. Sort of like a sense."
CPTSDmemes,fem54f1,t1_fem4tw1,1579240085.0,Well...real meds fuck up your brain and body way more than a psychedelic could ever do. If itâ€™s not for you thatâ€™s fine but I think taking man made synthetic chemicals is a bad thing. After taking psychedelics I donâ€™t need to take anything synthetic and I can live healthy. It changed my perspective on life and got me out of a deep depression. I could be happy again.

CPTSDmemes,felupi8,t1_felsd8f,1579231399.0,"Yea weed is really trippy, itâ€™s no surprise. It has psychedelic properties. There is a big difference in tripping on weed and tripping on psychedelics. It is very hard to understand but man, tripping on shrooms has let me leave behind my trauma and love myself. The extent of healing that it gave me was so amazing itâ€™s almost unbelievable. Tripping on mushrooms is way less anxiety inducing than smoking weed, although it is more intense due to the fact that youâ€™re actually hallucinating. But if you do it right, those hallucinations are so healing and loving. When I took shrooms I felt a motherâ€™s love coming from the universe almost telling me â€œitâ€™s all gonna be okayâ€. And that helped me more than any therapy ever did. Tripping on weed is super scary but in the right set and setting, mushrooms are amazing and healing.

Tripping is something that should be done outside. Itâ€™s hard to explain but trust me when I say you donâ€™t want to be tripping in some office with a doctor you barely know. If you ever decide to do it, do it with someone that is very close to you or that you love, and sit outside and admire the beauty of nature. Mushrooms will make you appreciate nature so so much because it opens your mind to how incredible this life is."
CPTSDmemes,fels4ac,t1_felrzdp,1579229573.0,"I disagree that itâ€™s a terrible idea to take mushrooms without a doctor. I think I would freak out if I was tripping with a doctor, thatâ€™s cause Iâ€™ve done it before and I know the right setting to have fun, which is with close friends and being outside. That said, itâ€™s definitely not for everyone."
CPTSDmemes,felrevc,t1_felqu7u,1579229095.0,"Im so sorry I feel really bad, no one should have to deal with that. Have you ever tried taking mushrooms? Thereâ€™s been studies done where mushrooms can â€œcureâ€ cluster headaches and migraines. Also I recommend smoking a nice strain of indica weed for your back, it could help immensely and give you motivation. Iâ€™m no doctor but these drugs have helped me immensely."

Iâ€™m trying to help you see the bright side although I know itâ€™s really hard. I have issues too although they are not physical, mostly mental handicaps. Trust me, I know how hard it can be. Itâ€™s fucking crushing just doing nothing wallowing over the hand you were dealt, but at the end of the day thereâ€™s nothing you can do about it so why not try your best to enjoy this one life? Life is fucking amazing and beautiful but itâ€™s hard to see that from your bed. Get better man."
CPTSDmemes,feliw9o,t1_feligcb,1579223257.0,"Iâ€™m really sorry that you have all these issues getting in the way, however doing things really will give you energy. Itâ€™s really fucked up how it works because you actually have to get over that huge hurdle, but once you do you wonâ€™t look back. I donâ€™t know how itâ€™s like to live with those issues but if you can somehow get past them and find a way to deal with them, you will feel much better. It doesnâ€™t have to be anything big, just do small things that make you happy. Take baby steps. Iâ€™m still currently struggling with my head but Iâ€™m able to function now at least. This is what has worked for me and I really hope you find what works for you and that you can live a life full of happiness and loving people, which is something that everyone deserves and can obtain by working towards it slowly."
CPTSDmemes,felhu5z,t1_felhfc5,1579222523.0,"I feel that man. I used to have 0 energy and would just stay in my bed smoking weed. What has helped me get energy is doing things that I have passion for or interest in. I recently starting working at my dads company and have discovered that I love business and it doesnâ€™t even really feel like a job because Iâ€™m always learning. This alone has given me so much drive and energy itâ€™s fkn crazy! I like to credit my healing to psychedelics and my own will. The psychedelics showed me the way and helped me see past my broken brain and I was able to see how to achieve my own happiness. Iâ€™m still not perfect and I have issues but Iâ€™m getting better and thatâ€™s what matters. Just do whatever makes you happy and you will get better. Go and talk to people, go out and do stuff, it helps so much."

Narcissistic personality disorder is probably seen as not being common because itâ€™s hard to diagnose and that people who are narcissists think theyâ€™re perfect and wonâ€™t get help.

LSD,feknfgj,t1_fekj0ii,1579203683.0,I feel like that would be super awkward on molly because youâ€™re just feeling so fucking good like youâ€™re having orgasms but not sexually. I donâ€™t wanna be feeling like that on my moms lap u feel? But Iâ€™ve never tried it. I feel how molly makes the environment super comfortable but still idk if I should.
