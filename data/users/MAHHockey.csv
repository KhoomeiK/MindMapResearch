That's lovely.  That just means, at best, the cost of building is not an inefficiency in this cost/benefit relationship.  When there's over 100,000 people moving to the area, and you can only build 1000 units/year, there's plenty of customers to go around.  At worst, because there's so few of them and such a shortage of housing, they can almost sortof price fix to keep prices high."

When it pops, prices go down, but from the ridiculous level they were at in the first place, and generally to what they started at before.

Seattle,ffagiao,t1_ffacdbp,1579735208.0,">The only way this is solved is by building enough units to actually push down market rates

Which no developer in their right mind would ever do.  The second rents start dropping is the same second developers stop building. The supply side in this supply/demand market is controlled by a select few, and counting on them to lower prices is a long wait for a boat that will never come.  The best we can hope for in the ""market solution"" is for rents to flatten or for their increase to slow a bit.

The only way prices actually drop by market forces is if the local economy tanks and demand goes down.  As long as there's lots of wealthy people following high paying jobs into the area, there will always be a shortage and there will always be upward pressure on prices.

The only way to help folks out who can't afford sky high rents is to either artificially keep rents low (""rent control"" which, of course, has loads of other problems that follows it. So no, I'm not advocating for that), or to subsidize/incentivise housing for a large chunk of the population that can't afford market rate housing (e.g.  housing vouchers, mandating a certain number of affordable units in exchange for taller buildings, etc)."

SeattleWA,ff9xfwd,t1_ff92ptc,1579723609.0,"Loose comparison, but here's the most recently built big indoor arenas in the US (last 5 years):

New Seattle Center Arena (for reference): $900mil

T-Mobile Arena (Vegas): $375mil

Fiserv Forum (Milwaukee): $524mil

Golden 1 Center (Sacramento): $558mil

Little Caesars Arena (Detroit): $830mil

Chase Center (San Francisco): $1.4bil

We probably slot somewhere behind San Fran with our construction costs, and Key Arena is about the same capacity as Chase Center, sooooo $900mil isn't too far off from what a new arena would probably cost. 

Another way to look at it: OVG has been pretty up front with how much their construction costs have gone up since the RFQ phase.  They originally said it would be done for $600mil, now they're up to $900mil, so a 50% increase over the last few years.  If we take the original cost of the SoDo arena ($490mil) and increase that by 150%, we get $735mil. But the SoDo proposal is a few years older than the Key Arena plans, so that's probably closer to.. say... $800mil for a built from scratch arena in Seattle?  So very loose spit-balling, we'll say preserving the roof adds about $100mil or about 13% to the cost of the arena?  OVG is paying for it tho, sooo... I'm pretty cool with them paying the extra to keep the historic look."
