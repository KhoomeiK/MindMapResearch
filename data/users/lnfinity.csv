Also, you seem to forget that animals don't just grow on trees. If you are concerned about things like deforestation, land use, pesticide use, water use, etc, than that is even more reason for people to go vegan. All of the calories and protein in the bodies of animals after they are slaughtered is just a tiny fraction of what those animals consumed, from plants, over the course of their lives. We are wasting huge amounts of resources producing animal products rather than consuming animals directly.

Being vegan is about minimizing the impact we have on others as much as possible and practicable, which is something we all ought to do."

vegangifrecipes,fdkhhwi,t3_elvoe7,1578503984.0,"###Ingredients

* oil for frying
* 300g / 10.5oz mushrooms
* 2 garlic cloves
* handful of cherry tomatoes
* 2 handfuls of spinach
* salt and pepper
* 100g / 3.5oz chickpea flour
* 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 180ml / 6 fl.oz plant-based milk (we use oat milk)
* 2 tsp apple cider vinegar
* handful of curly parsley

###Instructions

1. Add a splash of oil to a frying pan on a medium heat. Roughly slice the mushrooms and add them to the pan. Fry for 15 minutes or until golden brown, stirring occasionally.
2. Peel and dice the garlic. Add it to the pan and fry for a minute, stirring occasionally.
3. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half. Add them to the pan along with the spinach and season with salt and pepper. Fry for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. When the veggies are ready, transfer them to a tray and leave to one side while you carry out the next few steps (tip: we usually leave the veggies in the oven on a very low heat to keep them warm).
4. Combine the chickpea flour, nutritional yeast, turmeric, paprika, oregano, onion powder, baking powder, oat milk and apple cider vinegar in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until the mixture is completely smooth.
5. Wipe out to pan you used earlier, add a splash of oil and place on a low-medium heat. When the oil is hot, pour in half of the mixture and move the pan around to form a circle and until the omelette is approx. 18cm (7inches) in diameter. Cover with a lid and steam fry for 5 minutes. Add half of the cooked veggies from earlier to one side of the omelette and carefully fold the remaining half on top. If it feels like the omelette is about to break, leave it to fry for another minute then try again.
6. Remove the omelette from the pan and serve on a plate. Roughly chop the parsley and sprinkle it on top. Enjoy!

EffectiveAltruism,fcvzfem,t1_fcvhv0c,1578013607.0,"One area that I think remains somewhat neglected in effective altruism is the logistics of donating.

Each charity has different options available, and some don't seem to list any easy way to donate without fees.

Then there are charities that don't accept any common US or EU based payment options. I wanted to donate to FIAPO and Sinergia Animal last month (in addition to ACE's top charities), but there weren't any easy ways to donate to them, so I ended up donating to the EAA Fund instead in the hope that it would similarly provide support to promising upcoming animal charities in largely neglected areas.

Lastly is the question of taxation, which is likely a much bigger area of concern than the payment fees. With US-based charities it is somewhat easy for me to figure out, but for international charities it is incredibly complicated trying to figure out the tax consequences of a donation or what options are available."
