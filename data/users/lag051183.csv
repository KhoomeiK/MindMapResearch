facepalm,fedmmt9,t1_feczabs,1579015236.0,I'm arguing that it isn't facepalm and you seem to be arguing that he's evil.
facepalm,fecz6et,t1_fecqrjl,1578990749.0,You seem to be on the right sub.
facepalm,fecqjdr,t1_febxbdt,1578980940.0,Thank you for proving my point.  40 years ago it was different from it is now.
facepalm,febmcjv,t3_eo6zvh,1578960350.0,Cause Iran was exactly the same in the mid 80's as it is now?  Or that he's changed his opinion on it 40 years later and after going to jail for it?
KotakuInAction,fdvtx87,t1_fdvh0dg,1578751453.0,"I've had something against Daisy Ridley because she can't close her mouth both literally and figuratively.  Like when she acts she mouth breaths and when she does interviews she says things like the term Mary Sue sexist.  Other than her though, the rest of the actors were fine on and off screen"
kotakuinaction2,fcfuzqo,t1_fccufiv,1577633996.0,"To be fair, if you have to look for it then is it really woke?  Being woke is about virtue signaling and therefore is not subtle which is one of the big reasons people hate it.  And the man-splaining was in a ""short"" that wasn't part of the main series (I think it was a web release or something.  I remember they were done in an effort to sell a bunch of cheap bits to make up for going over budget) which were filmed during downtime on set.  They likely were woke as shit because they ultimately didn't matter/weren't planned."
