Petioles,fep3fve,t1_feobs6h,1579311269.0,"I regularly take breaks for a week or two at a time, but even during that time my brain feels not totally sober, things are still different than before. I started when I was 20."
cannabiscultivation,fennnwt,t3_ept341,1579288312.0,Jfc it’s huge! Good job.
Petioles,fennhny,t3_eq0bpp,1579288213.0,"Yeah. After years and years of smoking I doubt my brain could ever feel completely sober like it used to. I don’t mind it, it’s just different than before."
CrossStitch,fenmzqy,t3_epz9i5,1579288067.0,Awesome. It’s nice to take a break and do a quick one sometimes
Michigents,fe6f9sj,t3_ent6rh,1578889153.0,"Yeah, that’s where I got mine."

WTF,fdki7sj,t3_els5dz,1578504360.0,"Yeah, no thanks."
CrossStitch,fdietph,t3_elit0t,1578441294.0,Damn that skull is sick! What’s your process for working with so many colors scattered like that? Do you do one color at a time or do you have a couple different needles going at once? I’ve tried both but it’s sort of a hassle either way.
trees,fdfri78,t3_el4xji,1578368432.0,Nah not really. However I have noticed I have a little less creative energy after a few days of smoking indicas and that’s how I know I gotta either take a couple days off or switch to something sativa dominant. Maybe try that?
WTF,fdfb0zb,t3_el0899,1578357473.0,Jesus. Terrifying. One time my dad pulled a dead mouse out of our shower drain. It was fucked.
Michigents,fde4g2g,t3_ekp3et,1578330958.0,"We don’t even have many rec stores yet and it’s ridiculously overpriced. It’s honestly a better deal at this point to spend a few hundo on growing supplies and grow your own. Personally I make an hour drive to a different city (Grand Rapids->Lansing) so I don’t have to pay $30 for a gd 8th from the plugs here. Hopefully after the first rec crop things will look better, but at this point rec shops are kind of a waste of time imo unless you’re going in for edibles or carts."
science,fdd1btc,t3_ekmj1w,1578290882.0,"Yeah well, women are mean to each other and men are mean to women. So, it makes sense."
cannabiscultivation,fdd0j8e,t3_ekf66s,1578290021.0,"I would take this question YouTube, there’s many many videos to help you out. And it will be a lot easier to understand if you have visuals."

TIHI,fd6xwof,t3_ek3jlz,1578197084.0,The earth is starting to purge.
science,fd6x5l6,t3_ejwjcf,1578196828.0,guess that’s what you get when an entire generation is raised by sociopaths who inflicted trauma and weird ass toxic ideals. Imagine reading this 40 years ago knowing what we know now. Not to mention the world is literally on fire. It’s tragic but it makes total sense.
todayilearned,fd3ac4n,t1_fd201gc,1578156321.0,"Yeah pretty much. He just wants to control the pet population, this man."
aww,fd3a582,t1_fd2ntgn,1578156256.0,"Haha, true I guess. My apartment is like 750sq feet, so rodents would probably get kinda stinky. And my dog would def try and eat em."
