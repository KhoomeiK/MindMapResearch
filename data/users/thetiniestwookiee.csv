I kept thinking about all the complete idiots I knew who could drive and it made me feel terrible because if they can do it why can’t I? 

You will pass and having the independence of a car is so great. The key to passing is feeling relaxed on the day so if I were you I’d book another test and then just completely put it out of your mind until the day. Try and distract yourself any way you can so that you don’t build it up in your mind to be this impossible task."

CasualUK,ff4g6xr,t3_erkx4f,1579562837.0,I’d forgotten about these. They had the amazing ability to somehow make your mouth more dry after drinking them.
fatlogic,fev77gg,t3_eqob2b,1579393943.0,"I think what this person is failing to understand is that what’s triggering for her actually helps improve mental health for other people. Exercise is so good for your brain.

Rather than trying to stop other people from doing something that is potentially helping their mental health she needs to take steps to manage her response to triggers because this seems a bit extreme."

Cringetopia,fdlly2g,t3_eliddr,1578527012.0,I have so many questions and I don’t want the answers to any of them.
Cringetopia,fdlhjf0,t3_elzeq0,1578524155.0,What is even happening in this comic? Genuinely confused.
fatlogic,fdlgsac,t3_elu79r,1578523690.0,Love that this person’s argument is based on a fictitious statistic plucked from the air. A strong basis for an argument.
fatlogic,fdlgfal,t3_elvq0i,1578523472.0,"These people are basically asking to die on the operating table.

I don’t understand the level of denial here."

I really hope this person is trolling."
CasualUK,fcyqamy,t3_ejffpb,1578084888.0,"The exact same thing happened to me yesterday. Have been flip flopping on whether or not to buy one for months. Finally decide I’m going to get one and none to be found anywhere at all.

Nice chap in Smyths Toys told me that there was a batch of faulty ones that Nintendo had to recall so that’s why there’s a shortage at the moment. Apparently they should be back in stock at the end of the month."
CasualUK,fco1gjj,t3_ehpz2e,1577822359.0,"Toast one side of bread under the grill. Flip bread over and spread with marmite. Add thick slices of cheese and put back under the grill until bubbling. 

Marmite and cheese is the ultimate combo and I wouldn’t have cheese on toast without it."
