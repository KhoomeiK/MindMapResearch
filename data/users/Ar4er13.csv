And so it was on for quite some time.

As you see for crowd to change far it needs huge driving force, while in collective of few hundred people one by themselves can force change because they expose much greater portion of community just by doing the usual stuff... so no, the more people you have thinking on something, the more likely any minor agent of change will be rejected en mass or exist as independent cell in community which does not cause any comotion."
Artifact,fd9hmzh,t1_fd94tvr,1578233518.0,"But you got it backwards. In smaller environment it takes naught but smallest modicium of advantage of deck X over deck Y for it to be able to drive the meta, while in big enviornment without very sizeable counter such a change will happen too slowly, and not likely more than once per usual card release.

I, however have two problems with statement like yours and one in the OP.

1.Disingenuity

I am tired of explaining this in different facets, but whole regard to ""how well set functions"" would be the same as bunch of people buying Volvo cars getting together and discussing the wheel. Oh look how greatly it solves problem of moving hunk of metal around, such an elegant design *surely there are few car companies that can make anything like this*.  This is basically fascination with very simple thing that is reality for most games which were made, this does not occur only in situation where a) there is not enough content  b) something is specifically designed to be overpowered in such a way that there is no single counter to it in entirety of content... except you don't really pay attention to it because it only comes to attention when game is left to it's own means for extended period of time...which means it's dead. I am pretty sure that there is same ""insane diversity"" in many forgotten 1-set cardgames which were played to death by their small loyal playerbase...does that make those games good?  

And to be clear, I am not saying that Artifact is somehow bad in this regard, I am just saying that calling ""good design"" on that feat alone is just setting  expectation bar really low.

2.Arrogance.

There is much of it going around ever since we had uprise of ""hurr durr game not for you"" at the beginning and now with ""ooo but we still have so much unsolved metagame, while impatient kids cry and devs cater to them"".  This all stems from simple lack of understanding how to manage a succesful game. Most loyal fans and people willing to grind everything out for years are *minority* and cannot sustain a game they so much adore, however since they like game so much they ascribe to themselves a tag of importance, going so far as to discrediting needs and views of other people on entertainment... changes to the game weren't made too fast, on contrary they were slow enough for game to go under. While we can sit here and feast upon it's husk to our content... from industry standpoint this makes game not well designed either... I, for one, also take big issue with this during design process, but when you speak of what ""dev should have done"" you can only view game as a business...because that's what it is for them, oppinions of hardcore players mean very little, and even less because they will play anyhow (and I am quoting here mostly)."
Artifact,fd91cpn,t1_fd8vgsy,1578226754.0,Why what? Why metagame works like that in absolutely every game?
Artifact,fd918pe,t1_fd8wz90,1578226696.0,"Because as long as game is not shallower than a carpet there will be ways to tech against ""clearly the best deck"" and when playerbase is small such changes are fast to be picked up, creating natural rotation...which for example wouldn't work with large population because it's slow to adapt and in span of single card set release of other games you just don't have enough time for ""everything to shine""."

I mean, we all like artifact here, but posts like this keep reminding me that we look more like lunatics, chanting to themselves trying to find silver lining in everything.

As for OP's point it's because he never seen game being dead for a year while still playing it, if we'd still have for some miraculuous reason 60 000 players for entire year meta would stop shifting a year ago or at most shifted twice because it takes certain amount of stubborn players to force lock metagame."
