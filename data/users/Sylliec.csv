The_Keepers,ff8lcy5,t3_es0r6t,1579684134.0,"I have no doubt that Maskell caused, directly or indirectly, Sister Cathy’s murder. To suggest that Koob had anything to with the murder is ridiculous. How can anyone compare Maskell’s obvious motive with Gerry Koob’s story of the police presenting him with the meat pretending it was a vagina. The cops probably did pull this prank as it seems the Baltimore police were a bunch of boobs anyways."

Sacramento,feqgddz,t3_eq6zyl,1579341543.0,"Haven’t you’all noticed the dramatic increase in homeless tents on sidewalks and other public places lately? Its because a recent court ruling that says police cannot interfere with a homeless person’s right to sleep in any public location if the municipality in question does not have shelter beds available for the entire homeless population (and a city will never have that many beds available). 

So in the past the homeless were hidden from the non-homeless population. Those days are gone and we will have to deal with it.  We have a homeless problem and it needs fixing. Otherwise our city will go to shit, literally. I gotta say it would have been much wiser for our city to have saved its money and not given it to the Kings to help build that stupid stadium."
amazonprime,feq2c0v,t3_eqcl7c,1579336529.0,There was more than one retailer making the allegations and it was testimony before a House Subcommittee. It would not surprise me it it was true. A company becomes huge and starts bullying around smaller companies. Kids do it. Countries do it. Companies do it. It irritates me because shopping on Amazon is so convenient and it will start making me not want to do business with them. Amazon needs to start thinking about its corporate reputation and not be an asshole employer or an asshole business partner.

EARONS,femdtqr,t1_fem1xst,1579250367.0,"LE was mistaken at times, not negligent. IMO the biggest error was when the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office refused to listen to the Visalia PD when they told them the EAR may be the Visalia Ransacker. Sacramento shut that one down harshly. They even went public saying that the Visalia PD were unprofessional to even make such a statement (I forgot the exact wording). Who knows if the connection would have led the investigation to JJD, but it still was a missed opportunity.

Also had Sacramento worked with Visalia PD they would have heard McGowen’s theory that the suspect was a cop (because the only stakeout that the Ransacker showed up at was when McGowen went radio silent with it). Would they have then connected the ex-Exeter now-Auburn police officer who’s move coincided with the end of the Ransacker to the beginning of EAR crimes? Who knows."
amazonprime,felxb6z,t3_epsu27,1579233285.0,Just chill out. It is in your dog’s best interest for you to be a responsible dog owner. So do what you have to do so your dog doesn’t behave like an asshole. You’re lucky the delivery guy didn’t have a stun gun or pepper spray because he would have had the right to protect himself. And if your dog had bitten him guess what happens to your dog? And it would all be your fault.

Pets,feje6xs,t3_epfenp,1579169723.0,"My dog was on Hills prescription diet, until their big recall. But even before the recall I was having doubts about the brand. There aren’t a ton of options for prescription diets. So on the advice of my veterinarian I went to a website called Balance It. You tell them your pet’s information and first thing they do is get approval from your veterinarian. Then they formulate a recipe for your pet, you buy their supplement, you buy the ingredients from your grocery store, you prepare the food. The website is a bit clunky and irritating but my dog is doing well and I am pleased with the outcome. Plus the recipe was very simple and only a few ingredients so it isn’t as labor intensive as it sounds. I also got a food-saver so I can make big batches and freeze it."
Pets,fejdepn,t3_epfzi6,1579168542.0,"The dog is not disgusting, the boyfriend is disgusting. First, what low-quality crap is your boyfriend feeding the dog that makes him constantly fart? I promise you, high quality food eliminates the fart problem. And you mentioned the dog cannot squat to poop because he’s overweight. Whose fault is that? Drooling? Has the dog ever had a teeth cleaning? How often does the boyfriend brush dog’s teeth? I brush my dog’s teeth daily and she gets regular cleanings. That is what responsible dog ownership looks like.  Don’t worry, you won’t have to put up with this too much longer as your boyfriend is sending his dog to an early death anyways."
EARONS,fej9y65,t1_fej8b0s,1579163403.0,It is pointless to blame the past and say what LE should have known. There was nothing obvious about this case. It was not clear that the EAR/ONS had a law enforcement background. A popular theory was maybe a military background. Many people thought there was a property development background. There wasn’t even an agreement about whether the EAR/ONS was the Visalia Ransacker.

CatastrophicFailure,fecf7s7,t1_fe94mca,1578972485.0,"Does anyone remember when an airplane taking off from of a Washington DC airport crashed into the Potomac River in the middle of the city during rush hour in the middle of winter when the river was covered in ice? A handful of people survived but were stuck in the middle of this icy river. While hundreds of people looked on (as well as a tv news crew filming the disaster) from the nearby roadways and river banks and overpasses a helicopter tried to throw ropes to the survivors so they could be dragged to the shoreline. One of the victims couldn’t hold on to the rope and she had been blinded by the jet fuel in the water so she was just sinking and trying to swim in the freezing water. Firefighters arrived and joined the crowd watching the helicopter’s repeated attempts to get the victim to catch the rope again. Finally a real hero, some guy named Lenny I think, some government worker schmuck, dived into the freezing river fully clothed and swam out to the victim and pulled the victim to shore. He couldn’t stand there watching this woman drown right before his eyes. The firefighters surely must have felt ashamed of their inaction. 

If there is no risk in a situation, then people probably don’t need help getting out of it. People need help precisely because the situation is dangerous. Helping others always requires some type of sacrifice and is never risk free. 

Heaven bless the heroes of the world!"

EARONS,fdtknwo,t1_fdt63on,1578718142.0,Actually being in a trust does not necessarily make it untouchable. If the property was included in a revocable trust it is very much touchable even if he named a beneficiary.
EARONS,fdtkf2r,t1_fdt4a8w,1578718035.0,I know his case is high profile and I understand the need to ensure that he gets competent representation. All criminal defendants deserve competent representation. Yes we want any possible conviction to stick and to hold up to scrutiny. But JJD is not indigent. The court should aggressively pursue getting reimbursement as the county has no right to make a gift of public funds. Its like JJD is getting rewarded for being most despicable..
EARONS,fdtj6r4,t1_fdta69s,1578717522.0,"On December 6 2018 the Sacramento court judge ruled (after reviewing JJD’s financial affidavit) that JJD may keep his public defender but depending on how the things work out JJD may have to reimburse the court. They also noted that JJD’s assets may be subject to civil claims and judgements as well. This is paraphrased from various news articles.

I hope the victims file a case against JJD’s assets. If the county won’t take his assets then the victim’s families should. Hopefully its not too late and the proceeds from the sale of the house could be long gone.  

JJD got to live a long life and pay his monthly mortgage payments year after year. He had the opportunity to accumulate savings and retirement accounts. To save to buy his boat and motorcycle and whatever other toys he wanted. JJD’s victims didn’t get that chance. They didn’t get the 40 years of mortgage payments and savings accumulation so that they could build something to leave to their children and grandchildren. 

It burns me up when people post comments about poor JJD’s daughters and how they should be able to get some assets from their Dad. No I don’t think his daughters should get anything that their father doesn’t deserve to keep."

EARONS,fdt0m6j,t3_emww93,1578710378.0,"Hey OP your words are music to my ears. What I am going to do is call my county supervisor (as it is the Sacramento County Public Defender) and ask for a justification. This is not county money being spent, it is taxpayers money. And as long as JJD has assets then the county needs to to either take the money to reimburse the costs as the costs are incurred or the county should stop their representation.
