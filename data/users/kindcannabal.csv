The N-word has been used for centuries as a derogatory term for black people. It has no etymology beyond a descriptor for black people, and it's so bad, WE CANT FUCKING SAY IT.

Cracker is a term that was coined to describe poor animals herders who often used whips in their duties. This term was later used to describe plantation owners who whipped and treated their slaves as cattle. So once again, this sucks for decedents of slaves, not white people. It can be weilded as a racial slur, but that is not what it means, it's meant to insult anyone who is a racist, specifically to identify those who whipped slaves."
