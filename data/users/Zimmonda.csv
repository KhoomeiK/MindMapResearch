Thanks to NFL contracts being highly reported we actually know quite a bit.

We know Sherman was adamant about negotiating his own contract .

We know Sherman negotiated himself an awful contract which requires him to be a top 2 CB to be paid like a top 15 one and he's paid like a bottom 15 one if he drops form that top 2 spot.

We know it was so bad the NFLPA had to renegotiate a portion of it and the 49ers ***let them*** because they didn't want to be seen as taking advantage of a player.

We know he scheduled meetings with other teams but never made it there.

We know he only made a few phone calls after negotiating a draft deal and never sent copies to other prospective teams.

So unless Sherman ***intended*** to negotiate himself a sub market value contract we know that he did not do his due diligence by visiting other teams and shopping his offer from the 49ers around in full.

The alliance isn't (wasn't) a government, it was a loose collective of states to which members were allowed to leave which members like Gilneas and Quel'thalas availed themselves of. The alliance as an organization did not claim ownership of its members lands. It is neither a city nor state nor country.

The alliance never had a claim in the first place because the alliance doesn't claim land.

Ironically there was a kingdom that DID lay claim to a portion of Alterac lands which was Stromgarde, the lands they claimed however did not contain Alterac Valley.

No man, you're missing the point, those ""3 worst receivers"" played a significant amount of offensive snaps because it was actually our 6 worst recievers, Davis, Doss, Jones, Ateman, Nelson, Grant which means we had bad players on the field a significant amount of time which you may realize means Carr had limited options to throw to and yet he still posted a Career high in receiving yards.

That’s what you expect out of tour best players,  they make things happen. Carr is a safe player that will get to the  playoffs based on the team around him not his individual play.

The NFL as a league could decide to kick a team out if say the owner was bad for the sport or the team had some other drastic misbehavior (like repeated constant cheating).

nfl,ffan48u,t1_ffamd89,1579739842.0,"In the US the term ""Franchise"" is more appropriately applied to pro sports teams which are started specifically with the permission of a league (in this case the NFL) these franchises then basically (theres some more to it) become the private property (with some limits in regards to the league) of a singular controlling owner.

That franchise being private property is allowed to be moved just like any other business. In the past cities have attempted or threatened to use the legal frameworks available to them to ""seize"" ownership of teams. This what motivated the Baltimore Colts to move to Indianapolis.

I think your confusion is partly stemming from the fact that we don't typically use relegation in the us whatsoever. So whereas a soccer club would continue to exist if its relegated out of the premier league and can participate in the champions league, an NFL football team for all intents and purposes would cease to exist if it was removed from the NFL.
