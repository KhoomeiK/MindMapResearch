malelivingspace,ffitq9z,t3_ett6it,1579982489.0,It almost looks like the set of a bad Star Wars knock off and I mean that as the highest compliment.  I’ve always been a bit hesitant to buy this kind of stuff because “how do I match it?” And it looks like...you don’t? Like it’s designed to go together without going together. Love it.

IllegalLifeProTips,fcv12tq,t1_fcuxi4b,1577992469.0,"Stores can legally detain you until the cops get there but most have very stringent policies. Detain them too roughly and you leave yourself open to law suits. Try to question or detain someone and they didn’t steal? They can sue you for the public humiliation.  Most companies don’t want the publicity so they settle. So most lawsuits are automatically more expensive than whatever was stolen.  

There’s also risk to staff. That 17 year old cashier is not qualified or paid enough to stop what is possibly a career shoplifter looking at their third strike. When I worked retail I had a woman pull a large screwdriver out and point it at me as she backed out of the store. Oh yeah, they carry weapons sometimes. Screwdrivers are common because it’s not a weapon until you use it as one.  A knife is a weapon all day. 

At the end of the day there are some highly educated people in corporate who figure out the balance between loss prevention and risk management."

But then I forgot few people are more miserable than a “dry drunk”.  Imagine you have this thing gnawing at your psyche that you no longer have access to. The only thing that seems to tame that beast is working some sort of constant program (12 step, therapy, medication, some other things or combinations ). Working out, food, pot, disingenuous religion, work and lots of other things can temporarily distract, but sooner or later you relapse or pop.   Or both."
