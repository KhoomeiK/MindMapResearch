There was one time at a small family run zoo. I found an exhibit that had a rat in a normal rat cage you’d find at a pet store. Guy looked so excited to see me. So, of course, I reached out to pet him. I didn’t stick my fingers into the cage because thankfully I’m not that stupid, but the little guy still reached out his paw, pulled my finger in, and bit me. Oops. I was paranoid about rabies for like the next year. Never got it though, of course.

There’s a bunch of smaller stories too. There are tons of these little lizards, brown anoles, where I live. For some reason I’m sometimes surprised when they run off when I reach out to pet them. 

At some beaches there are grape-sized crabs. They pinch hard if you’re not a ninja-assassin crab petter.

I’ve also heard that dogs don’t like being hugged. We got a puppy a while back and I accidentally taught her to like and ask for hugs. It’s really awesome but I need to remember that other dogs won’t like it."

It was a good question! I usually take for granted that everything likes to be pet and or hugged. Totally not the case btw, learned that the hard way :P"

AskReddit,feo36g6,t3_eq1wzh,1579294551.0,"My own place, or at least roommates with compatible lifestyles. Right now it feels like my house is public property apart from my bedroom, so I spend as little time as possible in the kitchen as possible, and I never use the living room. It sucks waking up in the morning, to a dorm full of weed smoke. Or knowing if I want to use the dishwasher that I have to empty other people’s dishes first. Hearing the door open and close in the middle of the night, not knowing who’s coming and going. Waking up to find that the door was unlocked in the middle of the night and nobody locked it again. So many other little things.

I know these are mostly really small things. I’m really lucky to have a roof to sleep under, and even more lucky to have my own bedroom all to myself. It still sucks though having a house but not a home. It makes it so I’m always on edge."

Selphids can’t really do any of these things, apart from rampaging which destroys the current host body. It only seems like they can. Really, their host bodies are more like armor. The actual selphid inside can still die and feel pain and all. Overall I’d just give them an AC bonus and a minus to charisma. Oh and rampaging. That could definitely be OP if you don’t put strict enough restrictions on what’s an acceptable host body."
