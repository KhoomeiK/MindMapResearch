JusticeServed,ff2y5n1,t1_fdpsywv,1579528361.0,"A man should have a say in whether a child is aborted however he is not the one who should solely make that decision. If he didnâ€™t want the child then he should have used a condom or at least Plan B. Once a woman is pregnant, her choice should be final because she is the carrying the child for over 9 months. It is wrong to tell a woman what to do with her child."

AskReddit,fernlk9,t1_fep957g,1579356168.0,"My dad has been to over 300 Dylan concerts and is a huge fan.  I have seen him a bunch of times as well. Dylan is a great performer and has incredible stage presence. If what you were expecting was his voice and style of the 60s and 70s, thatâ€™s not what you are going to get. His voice hasnâ€™t aged well due to the all the cigarettes, however he sings with such feeling and can deliver an incredible performance. If you go to a concert expecting a different Bob, than yeah I get you would be disappointed. However, he is still great in a different way and gives every performance his all."
