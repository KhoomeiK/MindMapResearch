Botchedsurgeries,fff38mo,t1_ffddr0l,1579874508.0,Why is she dancing and twerking in every video that surfaces?
AskReddit,ff9tmks,t3_esc8vq,1579721001.0,"I would tell her that it’s not too late to ask for help and that the best person to go to is our aunt because she dealt with the same thing.  Then I would give her a list of names of people to avoid.  

After that we would go have some fun.  I would force her to mini-golf and laser tag and all the things that she was too much of a stick in the mud to do until we were much older."
rant,ff2yxed,t3_er9mdy,1579529051.0,Agreed.  Right now I am working in a city two hours from home (I stay there during the week and commute home for weekends) and everyday on that drive I run into some of the most stupid and incompetent shit.  I would rather not die because someone else can’t figure out how to drive.

Add some vegetables with dinner, maybe a piece of fruit with breakfast, a small yogurt with lunch, then swap out a couple of the steaks for salmon or chicken.  BOOM, not so unrealistic.  I don’t feel like I would be that drunk since 1-2 glass of wine at each meal wouldn’t be that bad.  But at dinner with the rest of the bottle, well then I might get a little tipsy."

BeautyGuruChatter,ff1i9ma,t3_eqwcng,1579479645.0,"Is it odd that when I first heard that she was trans (before I had a chance to watch the video) I thought it meant that she was in the process of transitioning from a woman into a man?  I never in a million years would have known otherwise.

I’m happy that she is working through everything with Dylan, but it really is lousy that she was forced into publicizing this part of her life before she was ready."
LateStageCapitalism,feujiuv,t3_eqerxf,1579387128.0,I finally reached $42k in today’s money and am still trying to figure out what the hell I am going to do each month.  Not pay some of my bills is the answer I’ve come up with.
vaxxhappened,femn268,t1_feltgn3,1579263248.0,"The main one was MMR.  I missed the timeframe of concern for HPV.  Apparently I also never had a tetanus shot but since you have to redo those very few years I wasn’t so mad about that.  So that day I also got the tetanus and a flu shot.

She did get me vaccinated for polio, meningitis, and hepatitis B though!"
vaxxhappened,felpywl,t3_epmbsb,1579228105.0,"This really gets me.  I am 29 and late last year I found out that I wasn’t fully vaccinated.  Not because my parents were against it, but because they were too lazy, or “busy” as my mom put it, to get it done.  

I can’t imagine how mad I would be if she tried to stop me from getting them done.  I was furious because here I had been traveling the world putting others at risk unknowingly and she didn’t think it was a big deal."

rant,fdw2s7f,t3_en2rn4,1578754463.0,"I’m sorry, that sounds miserable.  I don’t know if it’s helpful or not, but my dermatologist recommended Vanicream products.  My skin is sensitized due to acne medication so we have different issues, but if you haven’t tried it, might be worth a shot.  The ingredients are super benign."
rant,fdw0u4m,t3_en5mp0,1578753854.0,"I don’t even know that a thyroid issue is a valid reason for being obese.  I have hypothyroidism (and a pituitary issue) and am able to maintain a healthy weight by.......wait for it......eating less than a similarly sized person.  I did one of those RMR tests (where you breathe into the mask for forever) just for fun and apparently my metabolism is 16% lower than expected.

But I’m pretty sure everyone with a hormonal imbalance can maintain a healthy weight with extra effort.  It stinks that it’s harder for us, but it’s not some impossible endeavor.  I would really like one day to be able to eat whatever I feel like without having to worry about it, but that’s probably not realistic with my health conditions."
muacirclejerk,fdhulz8,t1_fded26w,1578430431.0,Haha I’m sorry for the pain that I’ve caused.
BPD,fdczi67,t3_ekpa9b,1578289019.0,"Maybe it’s just me, but I think most of this will probably vary quite a bit from person to person.  

I found my ideal person (we’ve been together for 7 years, I’m the one with BPD) and one thing that that we established early on that helps is when I am having “an episode” I need space.  There is no consoling me, anything anyone says will just make me angry, so give me a few minutes to cool off.

Also, answer our texts/calls/emails [immediately](https://imgur.com/a/Ni0tjyO) and there’s a chance we’ll be content.  The perceived abandonment thing is weird, even if I know my partner is at work and he isn’t responding to my texts I get very anxious.  I can’t help it, I wish I was better."
BPD,fdcyjh9,t3_ekgtga,1578288135.0,"I agonize over this frequently and how much better my life probably would have been if I didn’t have BPD.  My BPD was caused by (well, I suspect it was caused by) prolonged childhood emotional and sexual abuse and parental abandonment.  If my parents did their due diligence and stuck with me I’m sure things would be quite different for me.  But what can you do."
BPD,fdcx5dv,t1_fdcwm7w,1578286909.0,"You have nothing to be sorry for.  With where you’re at right now, definitely go in.  Bring the sedatives with you and surrender them.  Tell them exactly what you told me and they’ll take it from there.  Sometimes they’ll put you on a short-term involuntary hold, but I imagine you can stay longer on a voluntary basis too if needed."
BPD,fdcw800,t3_eknpk5,1578286110.0,"I never asked to be outright hospitalized (like inpatient) but I have gone to the ER/urgent care for severe suicidal thoughts a few times.  If you do that they may have you hospitalized depending on how things seem.  I’m sure if you wanted to be you could ask them for it to.  

One of the times I went in they would only release me into the care of another adult so I had to call my mom to come and get me, so I was held until she came.  But otherwise they hold you there until they think that you are good.  They do take the situation seriously, they never made me feel like an attention-seeker.

Honestly, I only recommend this if it’s like an acute suicidal ideation situation, like the thought came in really strong and you can’t fight it and you need to get out of the house NOW.  Because they don’t offer much for long-term solutions.  In my experience they might give you a referral or write a short-term prescription if needed, maybe get you in touch with a local crisis counselor."
BPD,fdcux8f,t3_eki067,1578285022.0,"I hope you understand that just because you said something rude it doesn’t make it any more acceptable for her to hit you.  I’m happy that you’re here asking for help.  But as the others said, tell an adult at school if you can.  They will know what to do to get you taken care of.

Take care."

BPD,fdctqml,t3_eknh5k,1578284058.0,It’s amazingly unfortunate how often even mental health professionals misdiagnose us.  I hope you get the care you need so you start to feel up to par.  ❤️
SkincareAddiction,fdc4ncg,t1_fd9vg96,1578267026.0,"Spot on.  I have seen several different dermatologists over the years and none of them were even remotely as concerned about sunscreen as Dr. Dray (or half of the people in this sub are).  If I land on one of her videos I will take her skincare advice with a grain of salt.  To be honest, I watch her videos more for entertainment than for education as I get advice and direction from my own dermatologist.  But it is fun to see how the advice differs between practitioners.  I will definitely not be looking to Dr. Dray for any lifestyle or dietary recommendations."
SkincareAddiction,fdaptci,t3_ek7gl6,1578248815.0,"If you can get to a Walgreens or CVS there is a topical cleansing solution called Chlorhexadine that is used as a surgical scrub and is a very effective antiseptic cleanser.  It’s not very expensive either.  Sometimes it can go under the name brand Hibiclense.  Maybe try carefully washing your nose with that.  But be careful not to get it in your eyes.

I’m so sorry.  If it doesn’t clear up in a couple of days you NEED to go in.  Make a compelling fact-based argument, have a tantrum, or do whatever it takes to make your parents listen.  All the best."
SkincareAddiction,fdaleju,t1_fdahw4b,1578247397.0,"I always partially dry off so I am kind of damp and then moisturize.  I think it would feel weird to go in with a moisturizer on soaking wet skin, maybe that’s just me.  I also wouldn’t want to stand there dripping wet while I do it, I would get super cold."

loseit,fd4qis3,t3_ejy0r8,1578170030.0,"No soda is good for you unfortunately.  Diet Coke won’t make you gain weight (directly) since it doesn’t have any calories but I wouldnt recommend drinking too much of it.  I drink way more of it than I should too.  

Unsweetened beverages are the way to go.  Tea, coffee, water.  As soon as you put some sort of sweetener in it it will a) have calories b) have some sort of other potential health ramifications.  BUT the sweeteners used in diet sodas are [generally recognized as safe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198517/)."

SkincareAddiction,fcz0qiq,t3_ejmx2x,1578091332.0,"My insurance sucks so I usually use a GoodRx coupon, Kroger Rx Savings Club card, or a manufacture coupon between these options I can usually get a decent deal.  For example, my generic 20 gram tube of .1% tret is about $35 using a Good Rx coupon at Kroger, they tried charging me $115 without it.  The one that destroyed my soul when I saw it was my Aczone prescription.  My insurance won’t cover it at all and the retail price was $800+ but I found a manufacture coupon to bring it to $75.  So definitely checkout those discount coupon sites, they can help a lot.

As far as the dermatologist costs, when I had my good insurance and hadn’t met my deductible yet it was about $300 to see them for a consult.  With my current lousy insurance I don’t even want to know what it would cost.  I don’t know what state you live in, but if you live in one that allows telemedicine, maybe see if you can find a telemedicine provider.  It’s way cheaper.  I am using a telemedicine provider called Dermatologists On Call that allows you to pick from local dermatologists and do it that way.  They send prescriptions to the local pharmacy for you."
SkincareAddiction,fcxj32o,t3_eg5162,1578064180.0,"No advice or comments on the medication results.  But look into manufacturer coupons (I don’t know if that’s what they would be called) from Galderma and Almirall.  They have a coupon for commercially insured patients that will wipe out your copay by a huge percent.

By the time I had healed enough and gotten the courage to confront him he was old and partially senile.  I didn’t want to be cruel and go taunt an old dying man by rubbing his mistakes in his face, if he could even remember them.  But now I’ll never get closure.

So now there are days that I am completely at peace because he is gone and I know he can’t hurt anyone ever again.  But some days I am inconsolably angry because I never got to say what I need to say.  I’ve written it out countless times."

I have been doing this for about a year and I have definitely gotten results but certainly not as much as you would think for as much as I paid the trainer in that time.

My new gym is another privately owned club with less favorable hours but it has much nicer equipment and a salt water pool, a bunch of classes, and there is a spa inside.  I am still doing twice weekly training with my new trainer but upped the time to an hour for each session.  

I have been pretty lazy about getting into the gym on non-personal training days.  I don’t have any valid reasons, I have just been lazy.  I have been eating at a slight surplus for muscle gain but it doesn’t really help you gain muscle if you don’t get to the gym.  It just goes to the blubber....  Here’s to trying harder!🥂"
