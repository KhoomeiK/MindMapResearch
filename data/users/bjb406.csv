CrusaderKings,ff2zomh,t3_epxcqj,1579529700.0,"In case anyone cares, I figured out what happened. Apparently when the ruler doesn't have anyone from his house he wants to nominate, ever. And when I won the war that allowed me to usurp the duchy title, I usurped it and gave it to my vassal all on the same in-game day that I won the war. It never updates the count for votes until a day passes, and it never changes the heir until someone has else has passed that person in votes. The title can only go outside the ruler's house if there are no valid candidates in house, and it only checks that upon succession, or if the previous heir is dead. It never checks if the current heir is a valid heir. Since I didn't wait an in-game day to give him the title, it still registered the heir of that title to be the previous duke's son, and it never checked to see if he was a valid candidate, and because the new duke had no one to vote for, no one voted at all. The day I gave the duke the title over, the previous duke's son was winning with 1 vote. The next day he was winning with 0 votes. And it never changed.  

TLDR the solution was reverting to before this happened, and waiting 1 day between winning the war and then usurping the title, and then awarding the title. Another solution would have been killing the heir, as the game would have realized then that there were no valid candidates."

First, gavelkind and elective gavelkind both give a +30% bonus to demesne limit, so you may have screwed yourself additionally there. Regarding giving your heir titles, its true it doesn't let you hand everything to your heir as a way of going around the succession law, but usually you can give them 1 county. There might be additional caveats though.  

Second, be aware that demesne limit depends largely on stewardship. For the purposes of demesne, it counts personal stewardship + 50% of that of your spouse. So I am assuming your wife has like zero stewardship or something.

television,fctasa6,t3_eirwqf,1577937535.0,"This is not an epic. It never has been, and was never intended to be. This is not LOTR. Its not about all the noble forces of the known world joining together to beat some impossibly strong foe. The Nilfgaard war is the backdrop to the plot. It is not the plot itself."
television,fctahbz,t1_fct7mwk,1577937285.0,"No, they went into laborious detail painting a picture of the motivations of all the relevant characters. Those relevant characters are Ciri, Geralt, and Yennefer. Why the hell would they go into detail about the motivations of a character whose real name has not even been mentioned yet? Geralt isn't even aware yet that he has met him before, and thus far has no interest in his/their war, beyond the fact that Ciri got caught up in it."
television,fct9xmi,t1_fct6omk,1577936841.0,"You don't need to know. Its not about them. Its about Geralt, Ciri, and Yen. They are just part of the overall setting. All you need to know right now is that they are Machiavellian warmongers, and the show establishes that very well."

nfl,fcp5skb,t1_fcowssn,1577851392.0,"The problem is that there are a limited number of places to get someone from. In order to know what you are doing, you need to have experience. So you need to have wormes as a football coach, preferably for a professional team. In order to get that job experience there are literally no prerequisites for the assistant jobs, it is 100% who you know. Then once you are in, there is not much of an objective system for measuring how intelligent your are, or how good you are at coaching, beyond  team success, which the assistants can only effect so much anyway. Kitchens was obviously only hired because the owner liked his attitude, and that's literally it. These coaching candidates aren't going into interviews with complex scheme ideas, or training regimens, strategies for managing group dynamics, because owners don't know shit about that anyway. So the selection process for most owners is kind of a crapshoot."

I hate the fact that we even started the tradition of a candidate picking their running mate (the VP used to be the runner up in the election), but the post 2016 Republican party is not worth collaborating with. The  only ones that were were either driven from the party, or died. No one left is worth the sack of meat that comprises them."
