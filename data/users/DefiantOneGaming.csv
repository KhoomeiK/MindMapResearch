Advice,fgfcj5e,t1_fgfb49t,1580734458.0,"Taking a mental health day or a vacation isn't an automatic remedy to the problem. It's a chemical imbalance. You can do things to work towards better mental health but it existed before you took a break and it will continue to exist afterwards. I told you I worked myself to the bone and the moment my hours decreased I started having issues again. Not because working that much solved my problem but it occupied my mind so I wouldn't have to deal with it. Taking time off may alleviate that stress or sadness temporarily but it isn't a cure to depression. 

I know full well nobody cares. Nobody has ever cared about me but you wouldn't know my walk of life or my family history so I can't expect you to know what I've dealt with just like I don't know your story. It's not a pissing contest to compare who has it worse. 

I live in Newfoundland and Labrador, not Ontario. Work here is extremely scarce by comparison. Getting full-time minimum wage job can take weeks up to months, speaking from experience. The time of year is everything.

I appreciate the words of good luck. Good luck to you as well."
Advice,fgf84iy,t1_fgf82bj,1580729445.0,We clearly have a disconnect here then. Any further discourse would be pointless. Have a nice day.
Advice,fgf7y2o,t1_fgf5p25,1580729202.0,"I appreciate how dismissive and ignorant you are. You sound like a pleasant person. As I previously stated, I got myself out of a hole on my own merit without additional help from anyone else. The inference that I'm some child who needs mommy's help to not overspend just makes you come across like a douche to be honest.

I can and have ""adulted"" in the past and up until recently. I get downtrodden because of issues that vary from person to person and you give me the bootstraps crap. I normally agree with that when the environment isn't complicated by the fact that the person involved is self-loathing and has traded most emotion for numbness. 

I've pulled myself up. I've worked my fingers to the bone, where my life consisted of nothing more than eating and working because I don't sleep, even trying medications hasn't helped me.

Before you try and push this idea that my issues are solely because of a lack of maturity, ask yourself if you know anything about my experience up until this point. I'm not saying I'm the MOST responsible or the MOST dedicated or the MOST hard working, if that were true I wouldn't be in this mess.

I'm just an average guy who faltered. It happens to ""adults"" when they commit suicide, or throw their lives away to become an alcoholic or a drug abuser. There are people out there who spent their whole lives being responsible and living a normal life only to have all of that come crashing down. 

No nonsense approaches only work when you've thought about all extraneous factors and considered them first."
Advice,fgf78hx,t1_fgf4up7,1580728208.0,"I did what you were doing before to drag myself out of a rut. I worked 84 hours a week on night shift. I never took any days off, I always tried to stay busy at all times. There's only one problem that I have with your statement. Living like that doesn't address the underlying problems. It just doesn't allow you to think about it because you don't have time. 

What happens when your workload suddenly decreases and now you have time to think about those things? You can try and block them out but unless I was worked to the point of severe exhaustion that feeling of emptiness and worthlessness would find its way in every time.

Your life may have been harder than mine, who knows, everyone has different walks in life and I've had advantages others haven't. That's not to say that how I feel inside has any right to be dismissed because of an outdated adage ""grow up"". Immaturity is not the cause of depression. If it was, ""established adults"" wouldn't be committing suicide suddenly when nobody expects it. They wouldn't have mental breakdowns and throw away their families, their homes, etc. to turn to alcoholism and drug abuse. That shit happens to people who have been self-made their whole lives.

That method is short-sighted and not sustainable in the least. I hope you don't but one day you may come crashing down just because you can't handle it any longer. Growing up isn't a remedy. Take care of yourself when you get the time to."
Advice,fgf41u3,t1_fgf3wdo,1580723262.0,"I have had actual consequences. I've been in massive debt and dug myself out of that hole myself. I never said this wasn't my fault. I made the conscious decision to take this program while not dealing with my mental health issues and it all blew up in my face. But to stand there and say I refused to try and the only thing that'll make me ""grow up"" is this, is just plain wrong.

I'm more than aware of my own role in this. But I don't appreciate that my mental illness is being treated as something that can be remedied by ""growing up""."
depression,ffqcgjh,t1_ffq8ayn,1580130259.0,Wherever it may take you just do your best not to give up. I'll be rooting for you.
depression,ffq4lvg,t3_euicer,1580120180.0,"My therapist pointed this exact problem out to me. I never put myself first because I think so poorly of myself. She said that if I keep giving pieces of myself out to help other people wherever I can, I'll have no pieces left to worry about me and my problems. 

I know that I'm more eager to help people I know than they are to help me. That fact hurts but it's the truth. I can't help but feel like I'm being self-centered if I try to focus on myself instead of offering a helping hand to those in need of it. I understand you and I respect you for caring for others but we have to learn how to sometimes put ourselves first. Good luck!"
depression,ff3z3s6,t1_ff39yv6,1579552007.0,I feel that. I've been trying to pull through but it's just getting overwhelming. I don't want to drop but I'm starting to fear that it's the only option.
depression,ff2w4lt,t1_ff2vb2x,1579526409.0,I've tried memory palace but not the others. I'll have to ask my therapist about them or do some research. I'm willing to try anything at this point.
depression,ff2srdq,t1_ff2sq0f,1579522576.0,I got the same shit. Drives me crazy.
AskReddit,fefwgcj,t3_eou6il,1579067439.0,I wished my parents were rich when I was 6 because I wanted them to spend less time working and spend more time with me and my brothers.
depression,fdgr71j,t3_el7p7n,1578406207.0,I've made this point clear to some people. Needless to say they stopped wasting their time trying to make feel shitty about myself.
depression,fdef3vk,t1_fdda3iv,1578337651.0,"Thank you, I appreciate the kind words stranger."
gifs,fbejmav,t1_fbeip1i,1576787150.0,You're just not accepting my point. You want me to concede all the ground while you don't budge on your position because you're convinced you're indisputably correct. That's arguing in bad faith.
