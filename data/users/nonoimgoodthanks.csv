relationship_advice,ff7exjm,t1_ff7cxpi,1579647977.0,"Ok, I read a sentence wrong. My point still stands."
relationship_advice,ff7eue1,t1_ff7dvuh,1579647918.0,"It’s not that he’s “not attracted to certain underwear”, he threw an adult temper tantrum about it. He refused to touch her when she wore them. He also got upset when she brought up yeast infections, even in the abstract. He doesn’t give a rats ass about her comfort and only cares about her body in relation to his pleasure. And controlling what somebody wears, especially in the emotionally manipulative way he did, is a red flag for abuse."
relationship_advice,ff789o6,t1_ff5xv7e,1579643071.0,This is honestly a precursor to an abusive relationship. Controlling what you wear to bed leads to controlling what you wear out leads to controlling who you hang out what time you’re supposed to be home... etc etc.
relationship_advice,ff77m4r,t1_ff60rlx,1579642704.0,"Nah, dismiss him. He doesn’t care about her feelings or comfort, why should we give a fuck about “dismissing” him or not?"
relationship_advice,ff75yio,t3_ertsws,1579641781.0,"Fuck this guy op. To him, what he finds sexy is more important than your comfort. In his mind his needs are more important than yours. This might seem small but truly this hints at something deeper. He’s trying to control what you wear and 100% this behavior will not stop here and will only escalate. This isn’t just preference, which happens in a relationship. “I don’t love that shirt on you” is different than throwing a literal temper tantrum because you’re wearing boxers. Also, he is almost THIRTY. He’s not a teenager who still needs to learn about compromise in a relationship and that your wants aren’t more important than the other persons feelings. No, he’s had plenty of time to learn those life lessons, he just refuses to learn them. His age didn’t sink in at first and I thought he was a teenager throwing fits about what you wear and how dare you mention yeast infections. Do you really want to be with someone who won’t let you wear what you want to wear? Do you really want to be with someone who throws a fit like a child when you mention anything related to you body? Even in the abstract like “wearing lace underwear overnight raises the chances of getting a yeast infection”. God forbid you get a UTI or something weird happens with your period, he will lose his mind. Please, coming from someone who was with an abusive man, whose abuse started with controlling what I wore, please save yourself from the mental and emotional anguish."

AskReddit,fewb4vj,t3_eqies2,1579407821.0,"Many times in my life I’ve had the overwhelming urge to call a particular person. Like almost panic, I need to check on this person to make sure they are ok. Usually it was my mom, and I would call and she would say she was just thinking about me, had a rough day and needed to talk. One of the times when I called a friend, he burst into tears and said he had a gun to his head. He was just going to pull the trigger when I called. One day I had that familiar icky feeling that I needed to call my mom to check on her. Our relationship was complicated and rough during that time. I didn’t call her. The next day I get a call that she had died the previous day. One of the biggest fucking regrets of my life is that I didn’t listen to my gut and call her. Miss you momma."

AskReddit,few1xd1,t1_fetyi1b,1579404336.0,So a few weeks after my mom passed away I broke down with my roommate about how I miss her and I know she’s gone but I just wanted to know she was ok. The next day a friend and I were hanging out and she says she had a dream about my mom. That all three of us were sitting on a bench and my friend kept saying to me “look it’s your mom” but I couldn’t see her. My mom turns to my friend and says “she can’t see me. Tell her I’m ok and I love her”. No shit my friend was named Sara. Maybe Sara’s have a special connection to the other side? (Also my roommate and friend didn’t really know each other so it’s not like they corroborated a story)
