What I found helped out was getting on an aerobics ball, laying your back straight with your legs out like you're laying on a bench, then rolling forward and down and butterflying your knees.  Come back up, and repeat (it's like a sit up).  Do this 30 times/reps, twice per day.  Follow with other ball-based exercises.  After you're done, sit/lay on a cold wrap on that spot for 15-20 minutes.  After 2 weeks, it was completely gone along with most of the pain in my knees and back.

I was indecisive at first and enrolled in History, then Anthro, and settled in Business.  Honestly, the first two majors are a total dud unless you want to become a teacher, or have museum or Library connections.

Business, Engineering, medicine (like Nursing or a public health degree heavy on Stats) are broad fields and you're guaranteed jobs even outside of your degree in that field.  I just graduated with a Bachelor's in Business Marketing.  My university teaches every degree in a way that you have experience in the other majors and can do everything except Finance and Accounting professionally without extra classes and certifications.

You need to look at sites like Glassdoor and Indeed.  Google, ""what can I do with a ------ degree?""  All of those things will give you ideas on income and job potential, what to expect at work every day, and where you find the majority of said jobs.  You will end up most likely moving after you get the degree."

The point is, all of those, ""elite"" schools may not offer a better education than most other state schools.

I didn't have to have the full balance paid until I graduated for that semester, but faced heavy fines if a certain amount wasn't paid by X date.  I put the second 1/3 on my credit card and paid that off completely when the bill was due to avoid the extra fees.  I did the same with the remaining 3rd and took extra shifts to cover those bills.  This helped me not have the transcripts held."
