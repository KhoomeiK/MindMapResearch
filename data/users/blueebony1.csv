depression,fco3cta,t3_ei1phe,1577823301.0,"I don't want to die but I just don't see happiness in my future. My hope is that I can get a job that lets me buy a property far away (ideally in the wilderness, but the countryside will do). I'm done pretending to be super social and happy when inside I die a little every day. I get my expectations up and I am literally always disappointed, I can't take it anymore."
depression,fc5eh6g,t3_egacg2,1577455180.0,"I'm really sorry to hear this :( If you ever feel like a chat, please send me a private message."
depression,fc5eajp,t3_eg7ris,1577455014.0,"I'm literally in the same boat as you - right now, I've been sitting at home for the last few hours when I was meant to go to the gym this morning. Well, this is what I'm going to do and I thought maybe sharing it with you might help! I'm going to go for a run (couple of miles probably before it gets dark) and then do a couple of home work-out videos. I find home work-out videos where I can control how fast I do the exercises and when I take breaks, are pretty helpful :) Plus, I find it impossible to do anything in the gym apart from the treadmill because it's the only thing I'm mildly good at lol"
depression,fc5dj7t,t3_eg8v99,1577454302.0,"Me too, but I feel like just trying to re-create the past makes me even more depressed. I guess it's that feeling of knowing that whatever I try to do now, it'll never be the same as it was back then."
depression,fc5d2rf,t1_fc1qbt5,1577453856.0,"Yeah, I try to talk to my family but it's so difficult as they're all facing their own challenges and I just don't feel like it would help at all to offload my troubles onto them. I would usually talk to my best friend about this but we've fallen out so right now I'm feeling pretty isolated. All I want is a better 2020 where I can find a bit of happiness for myself. Thank you for the advice though"
depression,fbxslky,t3_ef11v6,1577199386.0,"Christmas is quite possibly the worst time of year for me. I won't be alone but my problem is that recent Christmasses don't live up to anything near the experience I used to have (I think the last great christmas I had was in 2012). Maybe this is to do with growing up and being an adult, but damn I miss the magic and sparkle that Christmas used to have when I was younger. I couldn't wait to jump out of bed on Christmas Eve and do a last minute christmas dash, versus this year where I have literally just been in my room all day doing absolutely nothing. 

I'm sending you hugs and I hope next year is better for you."
