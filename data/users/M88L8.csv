WhitePeopleTwitter,ff9s08x,t1_ff9qnaq,1579719912.0,"I’m married, I don’t have any kids yet, but I am worried for that too. Luckily my wife and I have opposite work schedules so I do the gaming and drinking when she’s not there. I try to do my chores and stuff, but sometimes is really hard. My wife is very understanding and she helps me. She asks me about it, she wants to know what I feel during my panic or anxiety attacks, and it’s also hard to explain. The better thing I came up with is that it feels like when you put something valuable in your pockets, and then you reach for your pocket looking for it but you can’t find it there. Except when I get these attacks, I didn’t put “anything in my pocket” so I don’t really know “what I’m looking for”. It just comes and goes."

relationships,fedxm46,t1_fedwwie,1579022039.0,"Right, I understand. But I knew her, she wasn’t that kind of person. Also, as I said, I didn’t look for her after that. I left her alone. Nowadays when we talk about it, she says that she actually liked me too, she just didn’t expect me to say something about it. I agree with you, even a slight no means no. I don’t want to give hope to anyone with this, I realize now about that and that’s why I wanted to delete the first comment, but it is also true that every situation is different, and judging without knowing me or her is not very cool. But I got myself into this so I can’t blame anybody for it."

She didn’t know how to feel about it, because we were such good friends. I told her that I didn’t wanna hang out with her if she’d only see me as a friend. I never forced her to hang out with me, or looked for her or anything like that. I gave her some space, and let her figure her stuff out. She actually looked for me after a few days, she was interested in me."

relationships,fedgva8,t3_eoktfj,1579011175.0,"I married the girl that put me on the friend zone. We were good friends for more than two years, but I always had feelings for her. I waited for the right opportunity to tell her that I was in love with her. She didn’t see it coming, she was upset and a little confused, because she loved me too but as a friend. She never thought of me like that. But I told her to think about it, after a week she said she wanted to remain friends. I told her that I didn’t want that, and that if nothing more is going to happen between us, then we shouldn’t hang out anymore. We still hung up after that, but not as friends. I told her that I was gonna conquer her, and I was nothing but romantic to her. Eventually she fell for me, and now we’ve been married for two and a half years.
