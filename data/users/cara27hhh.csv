IdiotsInCars,fghwrbc,t1_fghn1iw,1580796263.0,"Well it's simple, the cars are coming together despite the car with the camera in it maintaining speed, so the other car is slowing down, the junction is a merge in which you would expect them to be slotting in ahead of you based on how the situation presented itself when the video first began, the other driver slowing down means that at the point you both reach the dotted lines you will be very close to each other. Other drivers are unpredictable, you can't count on them stopping, so you should also slow down to try to understand what they plan to do and give yourself time to brake to avoid hitting them if they do something stupid. Had the driver with the camera done this, when the other car turned across his path he would have been travelling slow enough to brake in time and lay on the horn, inconvenienced and angry but able to continue the journey - rather than sitting at the side of the road for hours waiting for Police/recovery trucks/ambulances and dealing with insurance and purchasing a new vehicle

Mill owners got very rich in some parts of England with good access to the atlantic, they had mills situated mostly on the banks of rivers or streams, these mills had huge 300+ feet chimneys and a fire was lit at the bottom to carry the pollutants from the factory far up into the sky. I'm not sure if eventually they used steam for power instead of waterwheels but I've seen some with steam engines in the base of the chimneys. As rich people are inclined to do, they employed child labour and other cost cutting measures like 16 hour work days, and made huge profits, which rather than paying tax or improving conditions in the towns they lived in, they instead used to elaborately decorate the chimney of their factory as a status symbol, I guess because supercars weren't invented yet. If you were building a house and you idolised these sorts of people - maybe you would want a fancy chimney at home for your coal fire. Most kids from the North visit these mills as part of their education, it's usually some roleplay situation with someone pretending to live in that time, and then a walk around a part of the building that was converted into a museum."
