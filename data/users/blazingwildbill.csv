DRZ400,fffm88i,t1_fffkevp,1579886983.0,"What gen m3? I left BMW after I got into motorcycles (kinda lost interest in cars after getting the drz). Loved my e30's the most, my e36 handled great and traded for an e46. Never had an ///M myself, but they are wonderful machines. I still have an r56 mini which fulfills my BMW desires. What gen m3 do you have? 

Also fair choice on keeping the m3, very easy to find a nice DRZ but a well maintained BMW is like finding a gem."

StonerProTips,ff9og3d,t3_eriu6h,1579717271.0,"I just tried this yesterday and holy shit, I hit my waxpen like usual and threw on Jay and silent Bob Reboot. 

I read this post after hitting the pen and didn't do any more hits after, within 15 minutes of topically applying to my feet it felt like I had taken another dab, and within an hour I was asleep. I vastly underestimated the potentiation effect."

StonerEngineering,ff622bv,t1_ff5w1rq,1579617157.0,I'm being a bit pedantic but they aren't meant to be microwaved. I pour hot water into the styrofoam cups and it cooks itself in minutes.

BlackPeopleTwitter,feouyw3,t1_feomyml,1579305982.0,"Gah damn, TIL. I did presentations on Dr King in school and never heard about that. Chilling to read, to this day it is way to easy for the government to lock up an individual for life to cover their own asses from blatantly committing heinous, unethical crimes."
DRZ400,feoskjg,t1_feoqpy7,1579304813.0,"I managed to put 11k miles on mine in 2 years, they really are great bikes. Especially in the Midwest! As long as they've had basic maintenance done and no internal engine mods they are very rugged. Plus, because it's essentially the same bike throughout the years used prices are roughly the same. I got a 2012 w 3k miles for 3400 in 2017. My area is high on bikes. I'm sure you'll be happy with it!"

I grew up in the church and two of my immediate family members work in a church. I've thought I was Jesus 3 times and honestly I probably will again. I understand why so many people believe it and get some emotional satisfaction from it, but it ain't for me. The tao and Buddhist philosophy helped me escape."
