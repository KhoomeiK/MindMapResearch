P.s.  she’s not a wild cat anymore, she’s your baby."
Catswhoyell,fff9iuv,t3_etaju3,1579879034.0,That just ripped my heart open.  How can this be that these cats don’t have a home?

cats,ffe54wn,t3_esyafp,1579836954.0,"Just curious, had  the boys who went missing been neutered yet?  Unfortunately that’s one reason they disappear...we used to be told you should wait about a year before fixing them, but that’s not true, you can do it much sooner. I’m glad you have your little miracle!"
cats,ffe4t80,t3_et3qsi,1579836712.0,"They might stick around awhile if you offer food and shelter at night.  Might be worth it.  There should be a way for people to post notices if they have lost a cat!  I mean besides turning them in to animal services.  I live in a small town, and there was one vet who just let them hang out in a big cage in her waiting room!"

kittens,ffe2h5u,t3_esykfx,1579834975.0,"Unless mom dies or has to go to another home there’s really no hurry.  They can be exposed to wet food if you like but they can use the nutritional benefits...also keeping the kittens together until at least 8 to 10 weeks produces kittens that know what hurts when you play rough, like biting and scratching."

kittens,ffe141m,t3_et35hu,1579833981.0,"They don’t understand words, and your actions aren’t logical.  Why not the kitchen?  They ask, if everywhere else is fine...try putting crinkly or crackly stuff on surfaces, like aluminum foil or plastic wrap that sticks to them!  Desperate measure is water in a spray bottle—they usually are more afraid of the hissing noise than the water, although few cats like water....I would just shake the spray bottle and they knew!"

One thing that’s in your favor, which is your vets have in the past or will be offering you pain meds for your cat.  When I needed this about twenty years ago my vet said there were no approved pain meds for cats, only dogs!  It is easily the hardest thing in the world, so keep asking for support!"
