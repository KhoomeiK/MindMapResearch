Invisalign,fdzq0fr,t3_engvlz,1578793157.0,Yes. I wore mine for 5 or so years and then stopped. Boy that was a mistake. Teeth went back to where they started. That resulted in thousands being spent out of my own pocket and wearing Invisalign with buttons as an adult in their 30s to fix teeth that were perfect all because I was lazy. Wear your retainer.
