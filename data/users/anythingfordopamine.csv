Im not arguing that our accomplishments arent cool, but if you arent going to acknowledge that their amazingness is only cool because it is seen from the perspective of us the ones who created it, then youre being narrow minded and ignorant to the point of view of others.

TheRealJoke,fd337wq,t1_fd09xy6,1578154357.0,"Essentially its a very poorly reasoned argument as it uses the fact of Chicago’s high rate of gun violence to “show” that its strict gun laws dont work. But ignores the fact that in the US relying purely on city wide, or in the case of the east coast state wide gun laws to show reliable data just doesnt work. As you can easily bypass local laws by traveling very short distances to get around them. Chicago borders and in some cases intersects the state of Indiana, which has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. So while Chicago does have stricter gun laws, its a joke quite frankly, because you can easily circumvent them by making a very short drive a state over to wipe your ass with those laws. Which is why its much more telling to look at country wide and state wide data on the effectiveness of stricter gun control laws. 

Im not anti gun, but there is a very clear connection between lowered gun violence and stricter gun control, and that doesnt have to mean banning guns. For example looking at Switzerland, they have one of the most armed populations in the world. However they also have very strict gun control laws at the same time. They have very strict early warning systems so if you are showing troubling signs they will take your gun away, they make you take regular mental health exams, if youve committed a crime you cant have a gun, they make you prove youre competent with your gun, among other measures. And they have one of the lowest gun violence rates in the world"

depression,fcmceau,t3_ehvaqw,1577770376.0,"I wouldn’t want to force this idea on you, especially since its so particular person to person on how you experience it. But because of my personal experience and how much it has revolutionized my life Im just curious if youve experimented with psilocybin mushrooms at all? 

Ive dealt with severe depression for years now to results very similar to the ones youre describing. I have a natural distrust for anything connected to big business and big pharma in particular as their main goal will always be to get more profits regardless of moral concerns. And personally I know many people who have started prescribed anti depressants that either A. became dependent and are even worse off than before when they dont take them, or B. the treatment stops working and they have to continually switch medications. So I started looking outside of these options to find something that works for me and read about clinical trials where they are using psilocybin to treat depression, anxiety, ptsd, addiction. And considering there are no recorded negative long term effects outside of personal variance in how your brain interacts with the substance, i became curious. I joined a few online groups around this idea and read of many people having long term benefits in lowering or removing the effects of depression and anxiety.

I first tried shrooms about 4 months ago to see for myself; although I definitely wouldnt recommend this for just anybody I started with higher doses on 2 different occasions. 3.5 grams and then 5 a few weeks later. The second was more out of curiosity to push my limits more than any productive use. But after the first dose I have felt my depression all but gone for the last few months. The longest stretch I can remember in a long time. Its like Im seeing the world from new eyes and a new angle. Ive grown closer and had more positive interactions with those around me, Ive become more productive exercising more, being more diligent with my day to day responsibilities. And even having the extra motivation to pursue my passions and hobbies more than before. Ive taken much smaller amounts about a handful maybe 4-5 times, about .5 gs or less in each of those times, since I started. And Ive just remained so consistent in my mood and mindset, its like a key turned in a lock allowing me to finally be myself again.

Again not trying to force anything, just sharing my experience. I feel somewhat compelled to share how this has helped me, because if theres anything I can do to help someone crawl out of this hole then I want to do what I can.

history,fcfrk7q,t3_eh0jt5,1577633064.0,"If we’re talking about humans as a group then yes, if youre talking about as individuals then the answer gets more complicated. At the end of the day we’re still animals and subject to the whims of the primitive side of our brains. As we gather in larger and larger groups our individual conscience becomes less and less prominent and we become exponentially more prone to be carried away by our primal urges and to ignore the gentler part of our nature. Group think is a scary thing, it compels us to do things we would never even dream of doing on our own. So unless we revert way back to pre civilization hunting gathering small group style living, unfortunately we are stuck with violence and havoc within our ranks to some degree. 

As individuals while we still are subject to our primal urges to an extent, our ability to process and consider our actions becomes much more prominent. On a singular level, leaving out obvious mental illnesses, and drug fueled acts violence is simply a byproduct of A. Our struggle to survive and B. Negative impressions forced upon us by society.  Poverty leads to necessity of certain actions that would otherwise be unthinkable. And witnessing the acceptability of violence within society throughout history has left it ingrained in the majority conscience. However this has not always been the case and does not need to continue to be the case. With more and more coordinated efforts to combat the adverse effects of poverty; homelessness, hunger, disease. And a larger collective push towards pacifistic ways of thought. On an individual level violence does not have to continue to be a fact of our nature."

politics,fcbkw7d,t1_fcasdgh,1577588052.0,"I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how a VAT works. Many many nations around the world already have a VAT in place to great results, and 10% is half of what most european nations have in place with their VAT. It would not effect the vast majority of people on welfare systems and wouldnt effect most of the lower class as those people primarily spend their money on basic living essentials such as rent, utilities, food. The largest bulk of it would be carried by the wealthy and businesses. With the 4th industrial revolution coming millions of jobs are going to be automated away with the advancement of AI and robotics being fully capable of replacing and out competing human labor. This isnt a fantasy, this is happening RIGHT NOW and at an exponential pace. So with that in mind there needs to be some sort of solution to prevent people from dying due to lack of an ability to provide for basic needs. To do this you need some sort of system in place to redistribute wealth to raise the floor for the lower class to give them the means to survive. The alternative to a VAT to achieve this is a wealth tax. The problem is if we try that, A. Not only will it meet a substantial amount of resistance to get passed into law, B. theres nothing stopping the 1% from just up and leaving to avoid that tax. A VAT is the only solution, and at 10% it is a more desirable incentive for companies to stay here over other nations. 

Also you have to consider just how much money our nation wastes keeping people incarcerated, as well as the root causes for most crime and drug addiction. Most people commit crimes because of a lack of money, most people out of prison go back because of an inability to find work and make money to survive. So the next option is to go back to crime which not only takes a cost on society but leaves the tax payer to foot the bill.  With a consistent guaranteed income to assure survival, people are less likely to risk getting arrested to make money. The number one stressor for people is financial difficulties, without this overall mental health in this country will naturally improve. If anything his estimates of how much money the freedom dividend would save the country is low balling it. There is a tremendous amount of money wasted by our government spent addressing problematic outcomes, the fact that attacking these problems at the source and preventing them from happening in the first place would save us money is only logical. 


I dont know why youre saying Yang is hiding information or being distrustful. He has been nothing but open and transparent about his proposals. He has stated MULTIPLE times, that UBI is not a silver bullet cure all solution. And that no solution is, and if anyone tells you that theyre lying. The point of it is to raise the floor to provide a cushion to protect people so they arent sent into a free fall when they lose their jobs in the next decade. Hes openly acknowledged that there are speed bumps with his proposal but its the best one out there to solve the problems at hand and why you need other policies to supplement that. Hence his 160+ policies on his home page, he has many other ideas to help solve the crises facing us because he has openly said that it takes more than a single policy change to overhaul and fix our society."

The 2 links to Yangs website have a multitude of other links to videos, case studies, and research papers on the subject. And its not just a few select companies that is a misnomer. The middle link I provided links you to all of the research papers on the subject addressing pretty much every single point you could think of on the matter. Theres 461 papers, so it was easier just to link you to the page where you can find all of them and explore for yourself"

politics,fc6anhc,t1_fc66418,1577476137.0,He provides links to hundreds of peer reviewed papers that support his policies. As well as providing links to case studies that show his ideas work. As well as the fact that he has tremendous bipartisan support for these ideas. His ideas have more evidence behind them than any of the other candidates. I recommend giving an honest attempt at researching his proposals before making a blanket statement like this.
politics,fc67nbb,t3_egakx8,1577474147.0,"Yang has possibly the best chance out of any of the other candidates to actually achieve real change. I love bernie and hes my second choice. But he scares conservatives and moderates and will not easily get any cooperation out of them. As well as the fact that I dont think he has any real proposals to address the 4th industrial revolution coming our way. This should be our first and foremost concern to address for this country in this 21st century 
 
The amount of independent, traditionally conservative, alt right, moderate left and even far left support Yang has is insane. Of any of the people he has the best chance to win against trump, and the best chance to actually get cooperation within congress to get his ideas voted into policy. 

And honestly I just love how solution driven he is, he doesnt get drawn into petty squabbles with other candidates, he doesnt put down other candidates or demonize them. He doesnt try to make anybody else the enemy. Hes simply focused on solving the issues at hand, and hes shown multiple times hes willing to adapt and change to new ideas when new information is brought to his attention. He doesnt act shady and avoid questions, and he actually provides sources for his claims that back up what he says. These are the qualities of a true leader"

Hes been Keeping everyone accountable, not holding back and being afraid to point out the short comings of the team even when we win. Very humble and respectful in our play with other teams. A focus on the fun of the game and giving such a community and family aspect to our team. 

Its trickled down so much to the rest of the players, even rodgers with his flaws this year you can tell is notably having a much better time playing. The past couple games hes really been coming into his own with this new offense, making daring throws again, keeping priorities in sight. The energy and joy of jamaal williams has been so nice to watch, him and aaron jones have been such a great duo. Feeding off of each other and having fun. Zadarius smith being such a leader on our defense, you can see the unit really starting to click and get such a chemistry going.
