news,fftftw9,t1_fftf1ov,1580219331.0,"I don’t doubt that. I’m criticising the way the journalist decided to report it. So, apparently, they don’t show the original article, which says 44000 in Wuhan alone. That’s 10x the number of reported victims, not 30x. Also, just because an individual can potentially contaminate another 30 individuals, that doesn’t mean that will happen. It depends on several different variables. I’m fine with reporting the worst case scenario as long as that is reported accurately, which I don’t think it’s the case at all."
news,ffsx0c0,t3_ev1gmp,1580195937.0,"Talk about sensationalism. First of all, I couldn't find the original report - that implies that the number is at 44000 - anywhere in this article. The one that I could find - from Imperial College of London - suggests that the number may be around 10000, which is a bit more than double, but not 30 times higher than the current number. Also, 4500 * 30 = 135000, not 44000 as reported in the article. They say 44000 on Wuhan alone, but I find hard to believe that there are almost 100k infected people outside of Wuhan. To be clear, I believe that China is lying. I'm just not in favour of sensationalism or creating unnecessary panic."

That said, I would probably fired an employee that did that to someone, colleague or not. I just don’t know if that would be legal.

Third, the fact that a lot of countries are taking measures is really good and will likely reduce the severity of the Coronavirus.

The game has flaws though. It's very repetitive - that is, the characters that you are going to find in an area are always the same. That means that, once you perfected your gameplay, it's really easy to complete scenarios without doing anything bad - or, at least, bad for innocent people which in the game, if I remember correctly, doesn't affect the characters mental state. It's an indie game, so those flaws are expected. I wish they could do a more detailed and complex game using the model that they created. They launched relatively recently Frostpunk but, in my opinion, it doesn't really compare to This War of Mine. The latter being a lot better.

The only attractive feature is to play games wherever you have internet connection - even then, there is switch now, which doesn’t require internet. Yes, the games aren’t the same, but still... Also, the only scenario that I can see where I want to play games outside of my home is if I’m stuck in another person house for long periods of time. Even most gamers want to go for holidays with their family and spending a quality time with them without dragging their hobby around. Commuting?
