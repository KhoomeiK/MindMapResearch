AskReddit,fdl6qlu,t1_fdkz6z7,1578517991.0,"Any sitcom in which the jokes are overly scripted. If the punchline is only funny because the previous five sentences were said exactly so, it wasn't that funny."
AskReddit,fdl6fhx,t1_fdl0pek,1578517841.0,"Give the cringe a chance. I had the same initial reaction, not liking to laugh at other people's awkwardness. You'll find the show does a great job at humanizing all it's characters. Their awkwardness is part of their humanity. It's not only a very funny show but very sweet as well."

funny,fdl55s1,t1_fdkxssk,1578517218.0,"Many municipalities in the US do not see frequent/significant snow accumulation and thus don't have the infrastructure to mitigate conditions. Think snow plows, salting roads, chains for tires on busses, etc etc. And when a city (and it's citizens) are unprepared, it makes transit a hassle at best, a danger at worst.

School is canceled because it only snows a couple days a year and people aren't ready for it. But it's not a big deal to cancel school because it only happens a couple days a year."

AskReddit,fdhre8x,t3_elgfzz,1578428692.0,"In my line of work (restaurants) there is a position called ""expo"" (shot for ""expediter"") whose job is to essentially interface between the kitchen staff (back of house) and serving staff (front of house). Busy restaurants may have four or more kitchen ""stations"" (ie. grill, sautee, fry, pantry) and could be pumping out 100 meals an hour. Grill knows he needs to make seven burgers, Sautee is putting up seven ling cod, Fry is working on two orders of wings, and Pantry has four different salads, but obviously this is not all going to the same table. Someone stands on the other side of the kitchen line and determines what food goes with what other food, what table it goes to, let's the server know it's ready to go to the table, and fields any special requests from the server that wasn't on the ticket (ie. a side of ranch).

To many people outside the restaurant industry, I think the job sounds a little redundant (ie. can't kicken people or servers do the same thing without a middle man?) but in a restaurant with any sort of real volume, the position is tightly defined and indispensable."
