AskReddit,fg8041c,t1_fg7zmro,1580605962.0,"This is the end has a lot of context. I like curse words in dailogues but I do so when they make a point. Search YouTube for ""this is the end cumming scene"" and you'll understand what I mean."
AskReddit,fg7wbvj,t1_fg7vpui,1580603128.0,Indeed it does. Sorry english is not my native tongue. I was looking for a word to express shock and fear. But not actual fear like fear for my life. I was trying hard to resist the urge to just pause the movie and stop watching it during the kitchen scene though. Dunno what word I could use for that feeling. Come to think of it I can't find a word for it in my native tongue atm. Needless to say it was extremely unconfortable for me.
funny,fg7vjd0,t3_ex9i9v,1580602533.0,That's just wrong...
AskReddit,fg7so5b,t1_fg7lddb,1580600483.0,Oh my God I feel you so much. I usually like those kind of movies. This is the end is a movie I enjoyed a lot. But this thing is just nuts. I remember my gf laughing like crazy with the sausages being sliced and baby carrots being eaten while I was mortified. I still can't understand how people laugh at this shit. This movie is  morbid and shocking for the sake of being morbid and shocking. No funny scenes no nothing. Even the dialoges are just 80% curse words with no context to them.

Showerthoughts,fg6b34r,t3_ex4cru,1580562139.0,That's actually wrong. Fat people have more HP than thin people. They do have less dexterity and stamina though.

TwoXChromosomes,ffrbzaw,t3_eunm8j,1580154897.0,I'm quite confused tbh. What's the point of this practice? If the end game was to make women sterile it would at least make sense in the mind of a lunatic. But bow I don't even understand the purpose behind this attrocity.

AskReddit,fckrq8y,t1_fcgn3ks,1577731759.0,That does not work on me. If anything it makes me more confident and more extrovert.
