FrugalFemaleFashion,fdzmnk7,t3_en5e0e,1578791775.0,If you want quality for a good price. Trying good American when they do their warehouse sales. I was able to get two outfits and a jacket for  $120. The leggings were like $25 each. The bras were $20 each and the jacket was $30. Just join the mailing list and keep an eye out for the next big sale.
