cats,fdvcwfs,t1_fdvbl97,1578746110.0,Our guy loves bandanas actually! He got lucky
Pets,fd98rre,t3_ekbv1u,1578230081.0,"If he is still this nervous it might not be the right time.  Puppies are a lot of work, and a huge money and time commitment.  Make sure you’re ready for the financial responsibility of 3 pets.  I echo the other comment about maybe trying to foster first in order to get to experience having the dog together and also for your boyfriend to see if he is ready.  Definitely sit down with your boyfriend and talk through what really is making him anxious about it.  The whole thing seems like it might have been slightly rushed (no offense here) but going from he is scared of getting a dog to we put a deposit down but he’s still scared... makes it seem like he was never truly on board.  Make sure you’re both 100% ready for this huge step in your relationship!  Good luck, and thank you for rescuing!"
cats,fd97fqa,t3_ekc2ph,1578229542.0,My cat hates lasers.  Won’t do anything for it once he realized it was only a light.  He instead loves fetch which is a great way to exercise him! He runs so fast up and down our stairs and then lays down when he’s ready to be done.
personalfinance,fcsaeia,t1_fcsa2ue,1577913760.0,He offered to split it more like that as well however I can still afford 50% just fine and my feeling was that I am using 50% of the stuff so I would feel bad not paying for it.  He also has student loan payments and i do not so he is able to pay those off more aggressively now instead of paying more towards our living.
cats,fcr3lq5,t3_eijym6,1577896293.0,"When they are a kitten they will inevitably wake you up at night until you teach them not to.  Ignore them completely when they come to you at night.  We started feeding him wet food right before bed to fill him up, set up an automatic feeder of dry food to go off at 3 am (the time when he would wake us) and also got in a nice long play session before bed.  Took our boy a couple months to realize we wouldn’t play with him at night and he sleeps with us completely through the night now!"
personalfinance,fcoi0cw,t3_ei9k7i,1577832701.0,My boyfriend and I have all separate accounts except for a joint savings as an “pet emergency fund” for our cat and also a joint checking for rent and monthly expenses.  He makes double what I make but we split 50/50.  We put the same amount from each paycheck into the account and it gets drained every month.. there is never a balance carrying over (give or take 50-100 dollars maybe).  After living together a few months we realized what we needed in the account.
Pets,fcoha87,t1_fcoerav,1577832201.0,It’s hard... but you literally just have to pretend they aren’t there and they will leave. A couple nights of this and they won’t come to you anymore at night.  My boyfriend and I also got an automatic feeder and would set it to go off around 3 am which is around the time our kitten would wake us up to eat...this way he didn’t associate waking us up with getting food.  We only had to use the feeder for a couple months before he began to sleep in our bed throughout the night!
Pets,fcogtm1,t1_fco8ahj,1577831888.0,This. I wouldn’t even consider dating someone who abused an animal.  It doesn’t matter if you think it “doesn’t hurt”.  It’s animal abuse.  It’s breaking the dogs spirit...and guess what...probably not correcting any behavior issues she is trying to correct.
cats,fcj7b21,t3_ehgqqm,1577679055.0,My cat sleeps with us every night and never wakes us up.  When he was a kitten he would wake us to eat/play and we ignored him.  Set up an automatic feeder so that they don’t starve and don’t associate you with the food. Also we tire him out playing right before bed. Sleeps in between my boyfriend and i throughout the night! Cats will get more skittish/territorial and have behavior issues if you lock them in a room away from you. I would recommend instead training your cat to not pee on your floors and not wake you up!
Pets,fcj52k2,t1_fcj1ug5,1577677465.0,I feel you! Just wanna scoop up the pup and give her a loving home!
Pets,fciya17,t3_ehetgx,1577672718.0,We have the same thing going on.  All day everyday it doesn’t  matter the weather the dog is constantly outside crying.  I’ve never seen them positively interact with her either. Breaks my heart. We don’t know what to do/if we can do anything.
Pets,fchivwg,t3_ehaugg,1577650855.0,THANK YOU! Also people who don’t pay for dental work/nail trimmings/quality food!! Pets are not cheap!  Makes me so sad to see pets not taken care of because owners turn a blind eye to medical expenses with the mindset of  “it’s just a dog” or “it’s just a cat”.  PETS ARE FAMILY
cats,fc5dgk4,t1_fc5ceov,1577454231.0,I know what you mean. I definitely didn’t want my cat getting on counters/tables either at first but kind of got to a point where I realized it is inevitable and just make sure I wash it down before we eat/cook which I did anyway.  And when he was a kitten he would sit in our laps while we ate but now he doesn’t come near the table when we eat because we used to just continuously put him down.
cats,fc5c5eb,t3_egb0dh,1577452908.0,Also remember it doesn’t necessarily have to be up away from the dog but can be in a space they can’t get too.  My friends have a shelf/bar thing  with about a foot of free space under it and the cat eats under there because the dog can’t fit.  You could also keep them on the table/ counter but just move them and wipe down when it’s time for you to eat.
biology,fc5bwfy,t3_egb0p2,1577452642.0,My aunt is also a retired nurse and now volunteers for hospice care.  She loves it! Gets to pick a couple times a week she has available and go visit with hospice patients in their homes and keep them company.
Pets,fbzegnu,t3_efau7o,1577243990.0,"Unfortunately, kittens will do this until they grow up a little!  When our guy did this we also ignored it and had to shut him out of the room.  Cats do not like shut doors, so if you can keep it open, he won’t meow at the door.  The best thing for us was an automatic feeder because that way the kitten gets food without associating it with you.  He began to know that he would get food at that time and wouldn’t get crazy/meow to get us up.  It is also a maturity thing, give it a couple months (i know it’s hard) and the kitten will grow up some more and not need the night time food.  We used the feeder for probably a month or two.  It’s inevitable that cats do “zoomies” at night so start scheduling some serious play time before bed.  We tire our cat out completely before we go to bed and he sleeps with us through the night now.  We also do a wet food meal before bed to keep him full."
