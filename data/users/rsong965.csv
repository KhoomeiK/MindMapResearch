Like he said that both strangers and acquaintances have told him to his face.  little do they know she actually has a stank pussy.  It's possible that she stopped front wiping.  Hopefully one of her newer friends has enough balls to tell her.  Most of her old friends seemed like they secretly hated her because she was dating all these famous people and was strikingly beautiful so they probably thought the stank pussy brought her down to their league.

Also, the drunk girl who told us said that she found out because they were using the bathroom together and the girl kept reaching deep in front pussy area then drunk girl said she asked if she had a tampon stuck up there, then the girl said she was just wiping her butt.  She said she knew it was bad for her vaginal flora but didn't say anything to her.

edit: also after us hearing and discussing the front wiping, one of my friends who had a super crush on her but was afraid to say anything beyond hello, ended up building so much courage because of the stank pussy revelation.  Like he put her sooooo high on a pedestal before that but he became smooth fuckin operator with her after.  He never hooked up with her though but he did make her laugh and stuff.  It was fuckin hilarious.  He said he would put his penis through the hole of his boxers in addition to the condom lmao.

She would make a perfect partner.  Anyways, her friend got drunk and was talking shit about her and told us guys that she front wipes.  She left and we started talking about it and we came to the conclusion that they all dumped her because she had a stank pussy from the front wiping."

projectors,fdtjf73,t3_en2ai6,1578717622.0,"Check this [forum](https://www.avsforum.com/forum/68-digital-projectors-under-3-000-usd-msrp/1254592-comparing-led-lumens-incandescent-bulbs.html) posting.  I was going to type it out but that post pretty much said everything about that subject.  But I gotta say LED projectors are better in damn near every way except for overall brightness.  Which is just a piece of the pie when it comes to image quality.  Most people don't know what they're looking for in a projector and see these fancy lumen numbers and think that's what they're paying for.

Not sure if it's a scam necessarily but it is certainly misunderstood.  I've had over 30 projectors over the past 10 years.  All modern, consumer grade projectors from reputable brands (never any white van scam projectors).  I've found that the picture quality varies wildly between different projectors.  These new LG LED projectors are the future of projectors.  They're seriously the only major electronics brand that is pushing this thing forward with new projector technology.  I have the PF1000U and it is fuckin amazing and had a LG PF1500, LGHW300g and LG PA75u before that, in terms of LG projectors.  I went to Korea and saw this ridiculously awesome HU85LA that costs almost $6k.  It was the best picture I've seen on ANY projector.  Don't listen to people saying the same ol BS about bulb projectors being better.  I know it's not the same but bulb is going out just like incandescent.  This projector thing is so niche that people on this forum just go on [projectorcentral.com](https://projectorcentral.com) and blindly follow their ratings.  That's why people tout the benq w1070 so much.  Most people don't have an auditorium or ACTUAL giant theater room (not a ""theater"" the size of a bedroom) so they really don't need a bulb projector."

I still have the short throw but sold or gave the others to my friends who loved em.   LG is honestly leading the way in terms of projector technology.  Big electronics companies like Sony and Samsung don't see the potential which is why smaller companies like Optoma and BenQ exist but obviously we all know how awesome it is.  like you said, everyone I know is impressed and several people I've shown went out to buy their own.  Projectors have been on the fringes of tech for a while. It usually thought of as a super luxury (homes with theater rooms) or the crappy projectors they've seen in school classrooms from the 80s.  Which is probably why there are a lot of people who your bulb projectors, which make a lot of sense for a theater room but LED is so much better in every way for regular users who don't need to project into a giant room.  But LG is currently marketing projectors (or beamers) very well to the Korean consumer and it is gaining traction.  I think one day more people in other countries will buy more of these as well. 

I know this wall of text wasn't really about that case but I'm just glad to see someone posting an LG projector.  One of the only BIG electronics companies that are seriously driving consumer projector tech forward."

No one's making it black and white, I was just responding to your strange comment that going through hardships doesn't mean you have to be a bigot in other areas. It's not that they're bigots, it's that they honestly don't have to care.  I'm happy gay people got the right to marry and that there aren't gay people getting shot every day for their sexuality. Even in super conservative countries, these things happen but they have far worse problems.  If I was lgbt but I was also being discriminated against for my race, guess what? I would easily be able to hide my sexuality so I wouldn't get fuckin killed.  Is that the best way to live? Hell no.  But in the grand scheme of things, I can't hide my race and the potential genocide of an entire ethnic group is a bit more important than my ability to have the types of sexual relationships I want.

At a certain point in any rights issue, we should stop and count the fucking blessings.  My WHOLE point is if we're sitting here arguing about something as trivial as gender pronouns and the number of sexual preferences, maybe we should be fuckin happy thats all we have to worry about here and not tell someone from an extremely marginalized group that they should care about that shit too. TBH, YG is so wealthy and famous that he doesn't have to care about the normal shit that a regular black person goes through anymore so he def has the luxury of giving a fuck about shit that doesn't affect him.  And it IS a luxury.  Poor people are usually too fuckin busy trying to live to be concerned with shit that doesn't affect them.  And that's what liberals don't understand.  Even though I'm college educated, considered myself a liberal in the past, studied sociology and psychology, led protests on the Iraq War.. I've come to see through the bullshit of the two prevailing thought machines.  You see what I say and automatically assume that I hate gay people.  When my only point was: why should a black man in america, who have damn near all experienced significant discrimination throughout their lifetimes, care about lgbtq issues today?  Why should any prominent black man take up the mantle of a cause like this when their own is so far from seeing justice?  If black people's only concern was whether or not people can say the N word and not life or death discrimination that happens in America every day then I wouldn't be saying any of this."

Black people who go through or went through the shit that's happening don't give a fuck about lgbt issues unless it affects them in some way.  And a gay black person likely has more issues in their daily life from being black rather than being gay.  Seriously, y'all white folks on here trying to tell others the black experience and how theyre the most homophobic is laughable.

funny,fc7jfv2,t1_fc7b839,1577509346.0,Lol dumbass. This is Reddit and we don't want that Facebook shit here.  So why would he go cry about it on Facebook? The fucking sense of some people...
projectors,fc7a1y5,t3_egkihx,1577501514.0,"3000 lumens is not low.  3000 lumen projectors are typically reserved for conference rooms.  And most of those rated at that level (aside from high end projectors) are highly overrated.  As in, it's more likely 1800 lumens or something.  And for that short of a throw distance, you really don't need something that bright. It will likely make the black levels look washed out.  Having said that, ive been to whiskey and Id say if you make sure the house turns down the lights hitting the back wall you should be good with a lower lumen projector. Go with a short throw. I have a LG PF1000U short throw. You can probably get one for less than a grand used. At a bit over a foot, you can get 150"" image. It's rated properly at 1000 lumens and with that short of a distance to the wall, it loses less light than a higher lumen projector with a longer throw distance.  Its also an LED projector so it will be less likely to overheat (stages can get fuckin hot) and pop a bulb.  Also, for some reason people don't realize that LED projectors actually test (using a light meter) closer to the ACTUAL lumen rating than similarly rated standard bulb projectors.  Which is odd because we see so many LEDs used in our daily lives in traffic lights, street lights, cars and home lighting and it's obvious how much brighter they are than old school bulbs.

Having said that, you really should test out some short throws if you have time."
funny,fc73jve,t1_fc6btxm,1577496587.0,"Not a leftist but you're still retarded. The wikipedia link shows HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE percentages of ALL residents.  In California, a state with a high immigrant population with low education (and homeless people that came from your shithole states) skews the numbers.  I know every ""educated"" person you know has a fuckin GED.  But instead, take a look at COLLEGE degree ranking.  dumbass.

&#x200B;

edit: look at this dumbass thinking his GED is fancy!! lmao.  But on the real.. good job for getting a GED.  I know it's tough out there in bum fuckin bama.  It's also been shown that states in the deep south like Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas teach their students a few levels below the students of other states.  Passing students who are barely literate just to meet W's ""No Child Left Behind"" act.  LMAO"
funny,fc6fabz,t1_fc6btxm,1577479203.0,Lol wtf..  you don't even need a proper education to look up the actual rankings.  Where did you get your facts from?

pics,fc68216,t1_fc4ri6l,1577474417.0,I don't know if it would've been a good idea to keep a condom in the airpod pocket.  Even back in the 80s when airpods had sharp plugs that could puncture condoms and make mommys have babbie earlier. They say it's 9 months but that could make it 6 months or earlier depending on which airpods you got.  The airpod pros are 8 months.
pics,fc4qy44,t1_fc4hwhs,1577425200.0,It can hold one airpod.. two depending on how ambitious you are.

pics,fc4gbe4,t1_fc4fv3f,1577415827.0,Well it could be used for anything really. Like weiners aren't just for peeing and helping mommys make babbie.

pics,fc4ekos,t1_fc4duuj,1577414400.0,These pants probably couldve held some extra gold though. Even in the airpod pocket. Unless they had an extra set of clothes in the mine.. which kinda doesn't make sense considering how dusty mines are.

makinghiphop,fc4anec,t3_eg0o9y,1577411195.0,"I think most rappers listen to beats before they write.  Some may ""freestyle"" when recording but they are usually recalling some rhymes and shit that they thought of (and/or written) before. I think you shoot yourself in the foot when you write before listening to a beat.  I'm sure you have a tempo range in mind but unless you like really simplistic beats then the beat should compliment your vocals and vice versa. These days a lot of rappers are more melodic and tend to pick real simple beats.  That reminds me of Pharrell saying that Ma$e is his favorite rapper in terms of his vocals complimenting his beats.  As in, Mase is very monotone and therefore doesn't really takeaway from the layers of melodies that might be present.  Anyways, at the end of the day it's what works best for you.  Personally, I think writing before listening to the actual beat is like dancing before you hear the music. But it's your own ear that you should trust and you adjust the process from there."

pics,fbtrpbz,t1_fbpg7bh,1577092247.0,"I know, I was being sarcastic. The comment I was replying to is short sighted. They make it sound like if someone challenges you in life (stress) then you should drop them and only keep people who ""make you feel good"". It's funny that they think this is hard to do and will be rewarding in the end when it's actually the easy way out in life."
