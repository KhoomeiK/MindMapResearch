I never have to try things on, because all dress manufacturers everywhere agreed on how to size clothing in 1893, and have never deviated.

Or maybe I have to grab three sizes anytime I try things on, because who knows what size I'm going to fit into in this shop. And even then,  I'll buy different sizes within the same store, because different styles fit differently. And god help me if it'll be the same size next year, when styles change and vanity sizing gets updated.

Edit: Also, at my heaviest I still wore M and L shirts; my pants were a 10 or 12. But my BMI was overweight, I had a visible muffin top, I got winded climbing stairs, and I was uncomfortable all the time. Maybe those measurements are more important than a random number on a tag."

Your child would forever be hounded by internet magazines writing trash ""where are they now?"" articles. I recommend confronting this woman and drawing a hard line in the sand. Gen Z kids are going to be haunted by a digital legacy that adults set up for them. This woman shouldn't be permitted to contribute to it, regardless whether or not you agree with the messaging."
fatlogic,fdfsgsh,t1_fdf2u1u,1578369081.0,"Ironically, when my grandmother in-law recently handed me a huge peice of peppermint ice cream cake, I ate it even though I don't like the flavor and I wasn't remotely hungry after a big lunch. But my husband and I were visiting with her while we were in town over Christmas, and it's not like anyone else could have taken the peice she cut for me. She didn't tell us she had the cake, or ask if we wanted dessert with our coffee. She just brought it out with a big smile, because here was a wonderful surprise Christmas treat.

I mean, it's grandma. I said ""thank you"" and ate it."
fatlogic,fde97se,t1_fde7u5d,1578333952.0,"Oh, I watched part of that video and became furious. The idea was that if someone gives you a piece of cake that is bigger than you want, it is fat-phobic to refuse it or ask for a smaller piece. 

So apparently, the empowering and pro-femanistic thing to do is stay silent, take what you're given, and refuse to stand up for what you want? Fuck that noise. I will not be forced to be silent and passive about my desires or lack thereof."
fatlogic,fd9wmvr,t1_fd7ii4b,1578238909.0,"A couple of assumptions you seem to be making:

1) Poor people have yards.

 Most poor people don't own their own land. Most rent appartments, even in small town and rural areas. Even if they have land associated with the rental, it doesn't mean their landlords will let them do whatever they want to it. Or that it will have a garden larger than a hobby size, capable of feeding an entire family.

2) Assuming people have land, that land can produce food year round.

 I don't know what the climate is like where you are, but for me it's winter right now. The ground is frozen, and everything will be dormant until April. 

Sure, people could can foods for winter, but that assumes people have enough land for enough crop to last their entire household for several months. See assumption 1.

It sounds good in theory. But that's only a viable solution for a small percentage of people.

Most of my life has been in and around major urban areas, so I mostly know about food deserts in urban areas. The problem is that there are only convience stores in the poor areas, which only sell booze and junk food. The people living in those areas are dependent on public transportation, so getting to a proper grocery store can take an hour or more on a bus, and you can only buy what you can carry or put on a small cart. If people in these areas work, it's often 2 or 3 low paying part time jobs, so they have to work long hours just to scrape by. Which means they barely have time to sleep and see their families, let alone spend 3-4 hours once or twice a week to buy perishable foods, and energy left over to cook the food before it spoils (let alone have the skill involved). And that assumes their neighborhoods are safe enough to be walking around at night, which often that aren't.

Is it possible? Sure. But time, safety, money, and emotional energy to deal with what it takes can be incredibly hard. Especially when highly tasty junk food, which we biologically predisposed to prefer, is right there. One has to make healthy eating a priority, and when surviving day to day is a fucking slog, it can be a hard sell that extra time and energy spent now is going to pay out in the future. Now sucks. We gotta deal with now right now. We'll worry about the future later."
