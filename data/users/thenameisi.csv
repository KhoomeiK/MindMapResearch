depression,fdf797d,t3_el1707,1578354932.0,"Although I've previously had some (mostly short and unstable) relationships I feel the same way... I still don't understand how anyone could ever have had romantic or sexual interest in me. I'd say it's pretty much pure chance, influenced by some factors such as (obviously) physical attractiveness (which I lack)... You meet a girl and she might fall in love with you and she might not... Usually asking for a Date is the way to go, works out like 50% of the time. So meeting people is most of the work (especially important is the setting you meet them in and the first impression). If you act as just a friend on the first impression it probably won't work... I mean I basically have no clue what I'm talking about really but maybe this'll help! Good luck"
