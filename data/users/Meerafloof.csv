KitchenConfidential,ffh2lka,t3_etfen3,1579921420.0,"My husband worked nights at a restaurant when we were dating, that servers had to tip out a percentage if the tips to the kitchen on a nightly basis. Servers made only about a dollar per hour less than the kitchen staff ( serving wage is now being eliminated). It was all done without the money funneling through the managers. Some servers balked at doing it, either they didn't last long or got less in tips as the kitchen staff KNEW who whined.  A server that wasn't on good terms with the kitchen staff, well their food took longer to make. At the end of the tourist season the best kitchen staff the wanted to retain for next summer got an extra $1 per hour bonus based on the hours they worked during the summer.  My husband went back full time to his union cooking job at the local university during the school year. I think he ended up working 4 summers at this job, before having enough seniority at the university not to have his hours cut back over the summer."

They go to a school that has uniforms, but the $5 Frozen T-shirt I bought her got worn way more than many of the “little adult” stuff. She has a sense of style all her own, no matter how much her mother wants to dress her. She’s not a doll, and very much has her own opinion. She wears the uniform 5 days a week if she wants a Elsa Frozen shirt or dress for when she’s not a school, she should be able to."

My kitties are strictly indoors due to our proximity to a major highway. I would love to know how you got Carl and Gary to wear harnesses, Caboose has a record of keep a collar on for 45 seconds.

She has 2 accounts the original savings account where I put her $$ as a young baby/ toddler. She now has a kids account of her own which she has the debit card for. I encourage her to keep only about $100 max  in it and put the rest in her original savings account. I don't touch the money, it's just not linked to her card, so it her card is lost or stolen, the thief doesn't have access to it.  But the money is hers. She's saving for a car when she's 16, a plane ticket to see her best friend across the country (I've paid to take her twice) and to get her own cat depending on what day you ask her."

DuggarsSnark,ff9rgdy,t3_esb4i6,1579719482.0,"Does Michelle really think this is something unique? Plenty of kids have bank accounts at young ages. Many banks and credit unions have young savers accounts with no fees to encourage good money management skills from a young age.  Probably better that this ledger crap the Duggars do. My kid has had her own bank account since she was a baby. I would put cash gifts form birthday and other holidays in it for her to have when she's older. She actually has 2 accounts now, one joint with me (the original one) and one she controls with a debit card. She gets an allowance now and she saves up. When the balance gets high (over $100 or so) we transfer some into her savings account. If her card gets lost or stolen, the max the thief has access to is that $100 and not the savings, which isn't link to the card. That will change as she gets older and shows she is responsible with her spending and taking card of her card/ pin."

DuggarsSnark,ff4kvxj,t1_ff374qk,1579566080.0,"I think religious homeschooling falls along the lines of inadequate education and laziness. People who are self motivated, and use a homeschool program that covers the same curriculum taught in public and private schools can do very well. A homeschool curriculum that is tightly linked to religion falls short of covering even the basics of the high school curriculum. The level of education achieved by the parents doing the homeschool would also have a bearing on the level of education taught in the homeschool. Parents like JB & M have no respect for higher education, did not achieve it themselves, and have no hopes for their children to achieve more than they did."

Tuesday evening coming home from work it was coming down, Wednesday was a snow day, for both my office and the kids school, so we stayed put as the road leading to ours is very steep. This morning the stuff has started to melt and re-freeze so it was a bit of a challenge to  get up the hill and slid a bit. Good tires and taking it slow made it doable safely. I have Nordman WR all weather tires. They have the mountain and snowflake symbol on them. Considering we live in the part of Canada that gets pretty mild winters the fit the bill well."
