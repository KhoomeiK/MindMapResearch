zen,ffc8vum,t1_ff2rls5,1579794209.0,"I'm not an ally of ewk, and to answer your question 

> But I am curious why the group here seems to value an entire book of ewk.

The reasons I can come up with would be:

1 - people don't check other sources of information, of if they check it, they have already made up their mind on what they think is correct. So when people claim that the one true zen is great and is available in this subreddit, there are people who believe it.

2 - they like to be trolls, and they come here and see that being a troll is an acceptable behavior and it's even encouraged, so they will like the atmosphere of this subreddit.

3 - they are anti-religion and will believe anything anyone says that is anti-religion no matter how wrong it is.

4 - they can find kind of virtual friends in this subreddit, this place has a fair amount of traffic, so they end up believing what is posted here constantly because they came and started talking to other people and that fulfills a necessity of contact with other people in some degree, so they rather continue to believe whatever is posted in this subreddit (this can happen in any internet forum, but in other places you don't end up believing in nonsense).

5 - people here claim that you are already enlightened, you don't have to do anything to be enlightened. That belief will attract people who want to believe that they are great or that they understand philosophy or that their knowledge is great without doing much just because they read some texts that supposedly say that and read people posting here that reality is like that.

6 - this place supposedly gives some sort of purpose. If you stay here, you're supposedly spreading knowledge and also supposedly alerting people of the dangers of the world for people. Again, like number 4, this can happen in any internet forum, and again, in other foruns you don't end up believing in nonsense."

Antipsychiatry,ffc19w9,t3_esjlfx,1579788987.0,"Ideally, if you decrease the dose gradually, than the insomnia will be much less of a problem. When I decided to quit taking the antipsychitic risperdal, I had severe insomnia if I quit it abruptly, but if I just decreased the dosage gradually the insonmia diminished and was tolerable. I don't know what your dose is right now, you said you are taking extended release and you can't cut them, when I took Effexor, it was a kind of plastic pill that if I oppenned it had a bunch of really small balls on it, so I couldn't cut it, but I could still open it and take a lower dose if I wanted. I don't know if the drug you are taking now is like this, if it is, you really can't cut it, but you can open it and diminish the dose.

If you can find a way to stop it gradually, that above all would help you. Even if you can't cut a dose of 50mg a day, you can then try to take it on alternate days to see if it makes more easy.

If you could get your psychiatrist or another psychiatrist to prescribe it in a dose that would make it easier to diminish it gradually that would help, but you might not find one willing to do that, maybe that is your case by what you wrote already. Peter Breggin is one psychiatrist who is pretty much against all psychiatric drugs, he wrote a bunch of books against them, he never prescribes them for patients with problems, he only prescribes them to patients who are already taking them and want to get off the drugs and want help in getting off them safely. The practices in New York, if by any chance you would want this kind of help."

That thich was a zen master. Than right bellow him ewk wrote an argument that implied that people who said Thich was a zen master were lying and another reason on why thich was not a zen master, so his argument is that thich is not a zen master. Then wdpw said he was using the ""no true Scotsman fallacy"", implying that ewk was wrong in his arguments that supposedly proved that ""thich is not a zen master"". So wdpw implied that what ewk said didn't prove that ""Thich is not a zen master"".  Then ewk said among other things that ""everybody agrees on who the real Zen Masters are "" , to prove that wdpw was wrong about his argument that ewk was wrong, so he wrote  ""everybody agrees on who the real Zen Masters are "" to prove that wdpw was wrong when he said that ewk was wrong in saying that ""thich is not a zen master"", so he is saying ""everybody agrees on who the real zen masters are"" to prove that ""thich is not a zen master"". If he is saying ""everybody agrees on who the real zen masters are"" to prove that ""thich is not a zen master"", that means that ""everybody agrees on who the real zen master are"" means that ""everybody agrees that thich is not a zen master"", because that is the point he is arguing."

If I had some issue that the medication helped, but I don't have that issue anymore, then I should never stop taking the medication just because I don't have the issue anymore, because that is ""to be too deterministic"". Or I need to do treatment because I'm unwell, and no one ever says what ""unwell"" means. And many more incidents. If I didn't leave on my own, I would be doing treatments forever. And yes, most likely taking a drug or a combination of drugs.

Such a thing would be much harder to happen with other areas of medicine. If my mother thought I was diabetic and needed treatment for diabetes, then I can just do some tests, and there is a real possibility that I will not have diabetes, and the doctor would understand that it would be wrong for me to do treatment for diabetes. The dentist I go to, she does treatment in my teeth when I have something and she explains how I can take better care of my teeth, and I can spend a year or more not going to her to do any kind of treatment and there is no problem, she doesn't expect me to take a drug all the time nor to have an appointment with her every week or every month forever."
AskReddit,fdjnha2,t3_elgpmo,1578479467.0,"As people have already commented, who would pay for that? Me? Also, what would happen during this mandatory mental health check? If the psychiatrist or psychologist tells me I have to do a certain treatment, who pays for that? Me? Can I choose not to do such treatment? Or if I start said treatment, and then decide it's not working, can I choose to stop it? I ask because I have already done  different treatments with different psychiatrists and psychologists, treatments that were supposed to help me. They were all paid out of pocket by my family, they were all very expensive, and although part of the treatments I did helped me, for the most part they were either useless or harmful, I rightfully quit them on my own, and some of the professionals I went to were abusive assholes."

I don't know if this would work or not, but there are psychiatrists and psychologists who are pretty critical of psychiatry. Maybe one of them may say that you don't have schizophrenia, or that it would be better for you not to take medication even if you have it. But I'm not sure of that, this is just a hunch. Peter Breggin is one such psychiatrist, Timothy Scott is one such psychologist. Maybe you can find such professionals in the mad in america website: www.madinamerica.com"

Meditation,fdfvdd2,t3_el1riy,1578371216.0,"When I began meditating, I was already doing some sort of belly breathing without noticing it because by then I had been practicing aikido for 1 and a half years, but then I changed the way I breathed to a way that moved the chest but moved the belly more than the chest. After that I changed to breathing only with the belly in a certain way. Then I tried a different way of breathing that moved both the chest and the bellly, but it was a way that was too hard, so I stopped it after a week or 2, and then started breathing only with the belly again, but in a slightly different way than the first time I breathed only with the belly. So of all these 4 types of breathing I tried during meditation, belly breathing did seem to work much better.

The time I most noted the difference between chest breathing and belly breathing was at one time when I had an illness which caused an enormous amount of pain in my feet and sometimes in the feet and legs. The pain wasn't constant, it would come and go away, and in the beginning I had no idea what was causing the pain, which made the illness much worse to endure. One of the times I was having pain I got pretty anxious due to it, but then I noticed I was breathing through the chest, and then I just started breathing using the belly (I didn't adopt a meditation posture at the time, I just changed the way I breathed), and the pain didn't go away but the anxiety did, and I was able to deal with the pain much more rationally and not panic like I had done before.

Edit: since you asked for instructions on how to breath through the belly in the comments, I'll describe how I do it.

The way I do it is a mix of the techniques described in these 2 books, that is where I learned it:

https://www.amazon.com/-/pt/dp/1590302834/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=zen+training&qid=1576590555&sr=8-1

https://www.amazon.com/-/pt/dp/0804832161/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=the+path+to+bodhidharma&qid=1576590585&sr=8-1

First of all, if you pay attention to how you breath, you will notice that you either move the chest or the abdomen to breath, and you either expand or contract the chest, and either expand or contract the abdomen, or a combination of those things. And you are always doing that automatically.

So, pay attention to how you are breathing and find a state where you are neither contracting or expanding the chest, and neither contracting or expanding the abdomen. You will be able to maintain your chest and abdomen immovable in this state, but not for long, for you have to breath. Let's call this state where there is neither expansion or contraction in neither the chest or the abdomen the neutral state, or NS, to simplify things.

From the NS, expand the abdomen as much as you can, and do that while maintaining the chest as immovable as you can. Don't worry about how much time you take to do this, whether it is fast or slow, that doesn't matter. Just expand the abdomen. And do force the abdomen to expand, don't just wait for it to do it on it's own. After you have done that, just relax the abdomen and return to the NS. Also when you relax it, again you don't have to worry about how much time you take to relax it.

After you have done this, contract the abdomen as much as you can (or, in other words, push it backward), again while maintaining the chest as immovable as you can, and again without worrying about how much time you take to do this. Again, you  are forcing the abdomen to move in this way. After you contracted the abdomen as much as you could, just relax it and let it return to the NS, again without worrying about how much time you take to do this. And after that, just expand the abdomen as described before and keep doing this cycle of expanding, relaxing, contracting, and relaxing the abdomen.

So, while meditating, at first you deliberately try to control your breathing and force your abdomen to move in this way and force your chest to stay immovable. With practice, eventually this way of breathing will becomes second nature and you will just do it automatically while you are meditating, and you will not have to think about it anymore."
Meditation,fdft4qa,t3_el4224,1578369548.0,"I suffer from CPTSD and depression due to dealing with some abusive persons in my past, and by meditating a lot the symptoms are gradually diminishing. So I didn't completely overcome the depression yet, but I certainly already reduced it's intensity."
Meditation,fdfo7zc,t3_ekz83w,1578366256.0,"I do have tinnitus too, I don't know if it's worse or better than your case. At the moment sometimes it goes away completely and sometimes it comes back and stays for hours on end or even the whole day. For me, it does annoy me when I meditate, but I try to just force myself to meditate even with the ringing in my years and even though I do get upset and think about how horrible it is to have tinnitus while meditating. By doing this, although the ringing  still annoy me, it annoys me only in a fraction of the total time I spend meditating. 

There are also different types of meditation, you can try out different types to see if one type would suit you better. 

Probably where you live you don't have this, but I live in an area surrounded by vegetation and trees, so specially at nightfall and to a lesser degree all through the night I can hear the sounds of the insects outside, and that sound even being not that loud it muffles out the ringing of the ears, so when I meditate at night I rarely notice the ringing in the years, so since I don't notice it it doesn't interfere in the meditation."
