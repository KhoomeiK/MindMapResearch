Neverbrokeabone,ffj0ize,t3_etoya9,1579987321.0,I have one on the top of my head from when I was 4 and my 6 year old brother came up with the idea to play catch with a rusted lead pipe. He whipped that shit at me sooooo hard. I can still feel the impact then the subsequent blood flowing down my face. I also remember my mom distracting me in the hospital so I wouldn’t be scared. She did a good job.
