curlyhair,ffc7xkx,t1_ffbevm7,1579793597.0,I think all the Shea Moisture products are CG. The pre treatment I use for detangling is the Shea Moisture Coconut Custard - Make It Last Wash & Go Curl Primer.  I use it as a pretreatment for detangling and then I use it again as my curl cream before gel.

curlyhair,ffa3hto,t1_ffa23xn,1579727146.0,Of course! I get a little peeved on here when I see people asking about the CGM and the responses are just “google it”
curlyhair,ff9uwj9,t1_ff9t4xv,1579721971.0,"CG stands for Curly Girl, you can check out the sidebar for more details on it or google it and there are a ton of resources online! The rundown though is that you start by doing a “cleansing” wash (or 5) with a clarifying shampoo to remove all silicones and product buildup from your hair.


Once your hair is clean and there’s no product in it, you start your routine using CG approved products, which are generally products with no silicones, sulfates, alcohols or other drying agents. So you use a CG shampoo, conditioner, curl cream and gel. You don’t have to spend a ton of money - there are plenty of drugstore products that are CG approved. 


I personally use all the products in the Shea Moisture Coconut Custard line and I love them. After that its all about finding the techniques that work for you. I use a pre shampoo treatment, detangle, shampoo, conditioner, then flip my head upside down and rake all my hair forward. I twist my hair on top of my head, finish my shower, and rinse the conditioner out last with my head still upside down. Then I scrunch excess water out, apply my curl cream by raking, and then apply a gel-oil by scrunching it in, still keeping my head down. After that I loosely wrap my curls in a soft t shirt while I put on my makeup/get dressed, and then blow dry with a diffuser on low heat with head down until it’s 80% dry, then I flip my hair back and finish diffusing it into the style/shape I want it. 


You’ll go through a transition phase where your hair might look wonky for a little while, but don’t fret, it will start looking right soon, and the longer you continue to do the CG method your curls will get better and better. It will take some experimentation with products and techniques but you’ll get it!"

I was mostly making a joke though. I struggled for many years with self esteem issues bc my teeth being very crooked and I was made fun of a lot for it. I still can’t afford braces as an adult so I just had to get over it and finally come to terms with the fact that I’ll probably never have those superstar teeth.

itsafetish,fegxypl,t3_ep0aq1,1579105018.0,"I went to school with a girl who was very troubled. She had a terrible home life (no abuse, just very strange parents and very poor), and she was obsessed with being weird. She took it way past the goth kid that doesn’t want to “fit in” thing. She would do anything and everything to make herself an outcast. In middle school a lot of kids bullied her for it and it almost seemed like she liked it? Even when nobody was bothering her she would purposely antagonize some jock kid she knew was going to start shit with her. After a few months of that they got tired of getting in trouble over it and started ignoring her, even when she tried to start with people on purpose. I have no idea what this behavior would stem from honestly, but it eventually, in high school, evolved into her reading/drawing explicit yaoi at school. She would leave it on her desk when she changed classes so the next person/teacher would find it, she would shove it in other kids backpacks when they weren’t paying attention, she would tape it to lockers in the hall. It started off as just like 2 anime dudes kissing and by the end of it she was papering the halls with cartoon anal gangbangs. Eventually she was expelled for it after getting in trouble so many times over and over. Once she was expelled, they offered to let her do online school, then remedial school and if she was good she could transition back into normal high school with us. The next year when she came back to school everyone ignored her for the beginning of the year. She acted relatively normal for about a week, and then BAM, came to school on Monday with a shaved head, wearing men’s clothes, she had flattened her chest and she told everyone to start calling her “Ed”.  This was in the early 2000s and the administration freaked the fuck out. CPS got involved and it came to light that her older brother had been sexually assaulting her for Y E A R S and she found refuge in some online trans community when acting out at school didn’t get her any help. Instead of reporting the abuse or helping her find help, they encouraged her to transition so he wouldn’t be attracted to her anymore? This was rambling but I always wondered how that happened and this sub has really opened my eyes about how these things can happen to a kid. It’s terrifying."

I don’t want that for myself, and from everything I’ve done research on plant based is the way to go for these health concerns.

I wasn’t raised traditional or religious, it’s a view I adopted on my own. My husband is also agnostic, neither of us have ever been religious. We met at work and fell in love. One of the things we discussed on our first date was traditionalism - he asked me if I wanted children, and I said yes, and that I wanted to be a stay at home mom. He was immediately enthusiastic because he was raised by a stay at home mom and wanted the same for his children. All of this is to say that religion did not influence either of our decisions to strive for traditionalism. Though we do dabble in some pagan practices now, when we met we were both atheists. We’ve started discovering paganism together to grow closer to one another, and because many pagan principles are ones I want to teach my children through pagan homeschooling. Neither of us believe in any deities still - just the natural, earth given masculine and feminine energy. I hope this helps! There are more out there like us, and it’s not as rare as you think."

Most places where food deserts form are bad areas economically. I grew up in one myself, in a very very rural southern area. We were over 30 minutes away from the nearest grocery store by car. Yes, we did have land where food could have been grown, but like most people who live in these areas, we didn’t have the time or resources to grow anything. My dad worked 60+ hours a week, mostly out of state, my grandma was housebound with an oxygen machine due to cancer complications, and I went to high school, worked 30 hours a week and took care of my baby sister. Most families around us had very similar situations going on. I couldn’t imagine trying to grow anything back then, or buying the tools I needed to do so. It was everything I could do to get to the grocery store once a week, and we were “well off” (slightly above the poverty line) compared to other families because my dad made a bit more money than average working in other states and I was good at waitressing and made good tips."

It was an extremely revealing “clubbing” dress, definitely not appropriate for her at all. This girl is an “influencer” so there were a ton of comments on her post, and some people were commenting how how inappropriate it was, but they were being attacked by others saying how it was misogynistic to say that, however, I sent the post to my group chat (all of us being feminist activists) and we all agreed it was entirely inappropriate. I think it’s easy to see a lot of one opinion online because people of the same opinion tend to crowd into online spaces together. I also think the “everything is acceptable” mindset is very trendy right now because of cancel culture. Everyone is feeling pressured to say that everything is okay, when in fact, some things are not. I don’t agree with porn at all, I think it should be banned entirely. This is a super unpopular opinion online, but the negatives of porn are everywhere, and it’s likely the cause of the crazy sex culture we have here. Over consumption of pornography can have huge detrimental effects on people, and I think it (and a few other factors) are directly causing the problem we have with women and young girls being so sexualized right now."
