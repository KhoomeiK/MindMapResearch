But cryptomining is a whole different level of sinister and in the hands of professionals can be much more nefarious, people just don't give as much of a shit because the ""damage"" isn't as visible and the effects aren't immediate.  But personally, I find the idea of my machine being used for direct profit more offending than the idea of it being used to troll someone on 4chan because I'm fully aware of how mediocre my build would be for the purposes of a DDoS.

todayilearned,fds2f1c,t1_fds11dv,1578693271.0,">Most of the PCs being infected are so dated they might mine $1/year,

I'd wager to bet you're wrong.  With every other 10 year old having some overpowered gaming machine and the advent of streaming and people having multiple machines at once becoming more common I'd say it's very  much more common to find infected machines that are capable of much more than you assume.


There's not a lot of individuals (in the US) still using Packard Bells and the only people using low-powered hardware in large volumes are enterprise clients and they tend to operate in large numbers which negates the effect of the dated hardware.  1000 shit PCs can produce an alarming amount of hash power, though it's obviously not ideal.

> I’d wager to say you’d need a shit ton of computers to make either one worth it.

This is fact, that's why most botnets for any purpose number in the thousands or tens of thousands

>Think of the average $300 Walmart PC someone’s grandma has... that’s going to make up 90%+ of the power available. 

No, enterprise level server hardware and workstations are going to make up 90% of the power available to an intelligent botnet operator.  This kind of hardware is literally designed for crunching numbers and farting out network data.  Only script kiddies and poorfags from places like Brazil are purposefully infecting low-level consumer hardware like Grandma's PC.  You're thinking way too small.

>No one would waste their time crypto-mining with “less than 100 bots”.

I specifically said it would be pitiful but in strictly comparative terms you could objectively get more power from 100 mining machines (if you target high powered hardware) than you ever could from 100 of the best possible DDoS bots.  100 bots isn't going to DDoS anything bigger than a fucking blog but 100 carefully selected crypto bots could easily generate a tidy profit that virtually never stops.  It's also guaranteed profit with no overhead and requires no other work.  You don't have to hold anything ransom, you don't have to announce your presence at all.  You just sit back and quietly siphon hash power and watch the cash pile up, even if it's a trickle.  It's a free trickle.  You're not banking on a big cashout, you're playing the long game.  
 
>Hell, another big thing for botnets now is a lot of homes have unsecured smart TVs, fridges, toasters, lightbulbs

You can crypto-mine with less than 100 bots (though obviously this would be considered absolutely pitiful) and it's a better scheme because the infection itself generates profit and doesn't rely on a secondary form of payment such as ransom.  Why waste the time, effort, and resources infecting thousands of bots to *hopefully* convince a company to pay you money before your bots are simply blacklisted and when you can just make the bots literally create money for you directly. 

 A bot farm capable of the doomsday bullshit you're talking about would be exponentially larger, require more skill to maintain and use, and is a much worse risk-to-reward than crypto-mining.
