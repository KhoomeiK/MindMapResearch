husky,ff1v40i,t3_eqwx82,1579486855.0,Huskies are so weird. Aren‚Äôt they the best?

dogs,feh85lm,t3_ep5jpm,1579111133.0,"These are all such great responses and worded very well. I agree, it‚Äôs never going to feel right but from your very honest description, it does sound like it‚Äôs time. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

dogs,febzlte,t1_febxrdq,1578964619.0,"Wow, I really didn‚Äôt realize how everyone seems to have the exact same problem as me. I wish we all lived closer to each other! We could band together..."
dogs,febq7b3,t1_febp54v,1578961510.0,I haven‚Äôt used it yet.
dogs,febpu6e,t1_feb4sz9,1578961375.0,That‚Äôs crazy!
dogs,feb16b5,t1_feazaiy,1578954420.0,Thanks for trying to suggest something helpful but I don‚Äôt see that going well.
dogs,fearlad,t3_eo5ud3,1578951604.0,You‚Äôre so nice! I‚Äôm feeling much better. I was feeling crazy because it seems like it was only happening to me and I‚Äôm made out to be the weirdo.
dogs,feansso,t1_feag377,1578950672.0,"Wow, I‚Äôm so sorry! Was the owner held responsible?"
dogs,fean3hz,t1_feabf4l,1578950456.0,"Yeah, I have to drive away to walk her, too. I have to pick my streets carefully or I drive to the next town over."
dogs,feamqce,t3_eo5ud3,1578950366.0,There‚Äôs always one person like that.
dogs,feamjku,t3_eo5ud3,1578950309.0,That‚Äôs beyond unreasonable!
dogs,fealvc5,t3_eo5ud3,1578950196.0,Rules are pointless if no one enforces them.
dogs,fea34m4,t3_eo5ud3,1578943872.0,This is exactly how my day goes every day. I feel your pain! And I already feel better knowing I‚Äôm not the only anxious dog walker out there. It‚Äôs not that hard to follow rules. Or apparently it is. Sigh.
dogs,fe9e61v,t1_fe9e1cu,1578936752.0,"That‚Äôs exactly what I don‚Äôt understand! Clearly they don‚Äôt care about their dogs. And if they don‚Äôt care about their own dogs, how can I expect them to care about mine?"
dogs,fe9e1b9,t3_eo5ud3,1578936700.0,Lol thanks for the info! I‚Äôll look in to more trails.
dogs,fe9dkb3,t1_fe9c8ua,1578936624.0,"Wow, I‚Äôm so sorry for this! People really ruin things for others."
dogs,fe9dd7o,t1_fe9aq0y,1578936566.0,Thanks for the info. There are actually leash laws where I live. I called Animal Control for the first time yesterday.
dogs,fe95ym3,t3_eo5ud3,1578934628.0,"Yeah, it‚Äôs impossible to make progress when people‚Äôs dogs continually run up to you."
dogs,fe8x0o1,t1_fe8vyzy,1578931970.0,Thanks for the advice. I actually called animal control yesterday.
dogs,fe8wqi7,t1_fe8vf51,1578931923.0,It feels good to know I‚Äôm not alone.
dogs,fe8vekl,t3_eo5ud3,1578931446.0,"It‚Äôs not really rural, though. Just another suburb. Yes, there‚Äôs a trail but I walk her so often, I have to switch up where we walk to keep her interested."
HumansBeingBros,fe3908b,t1_fdz6rnn,1578847108.0,Seriously is cute!
aww,fdz3wtv,t3_en8shc,1578786363.0,That was awesome!!!

mildlyinteresting,fdi5alg,t3_elivf0,1578435983.0,He looks insulted.
aww,fddodos,t3_ekuimf,1578319478.0,Am I the only one that sees the dog eats the bird? Or is that part of the irony?
husky,fct8lpl,t3_eirud3,1577935773.0,"Thanks for the update! Do you have pet insurance? Sorry to be nosy, just curious how that insane cost is covered! And very thankful that it is."

husky,fcn1oc1,t1_fckogtp,1577800719.0,Lol! It‚Äôs always a hassle to get her inside. I usually end up having to bribe her.
dogs,fck31of,t3_ehf4hk,1577715094.0,"I can‚Äôt fathom everything you‚Äôve been through. This might not be the time to hear this, but you‚Äôre going to be so much stronger from all of this and you‚Äôll be able to help other people/dogs through hard parts of their lives. ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Thinking of you today."
dogs,fcc0ivo,t1_fcbv1dq,1577593037.0,"Mine is terrible too but because of off-leash dogs, 1-2 a week. It‚Äôs ridiculous. People by me just open their front door and let their dogs out to do their business. And 9 out of 10, they run up to my dog. It gives me such anxiety."
dogs,fcabyjp,t3_egqwiv,1577566438.0,I‚Äôm glad you shared this. Owning a dog is ruined by other ignorant dog owners almost every day for me. This uplifts my spirits a bit. Thanks!
worldnews,fc5vijj,t3_eg70d7,1577466796.0,Sick. People are sick. He‚Äôll get his. Truly believe in Karma and he‚Äôs just bringing it on himself.
husky,fc47ky9,t3_eg2402,1577408766.0,Literally my worst nightmare. I‚Äôm hoping for the best!
