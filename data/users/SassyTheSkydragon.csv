I'm neither promoting eating meat nor do I strongly bash the vegan diet. I couldn't care less about what someone stuffs their body, I'm just saying that some people should get off their high horses (in both dietary extremes), stop that whole ""holier than thou"" crap and realize that there's no ultimate, pure dietary direction yet. Biological engineering isn't there yet to make artificial meat widely available and affordable."
