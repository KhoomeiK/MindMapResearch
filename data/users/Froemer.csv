I don't personally know of any graphic engines that import After Effects projects directly. You usually need to pre-render into MOV files or image sequences without text, then the engine has dynamic text tools you can use to enter data that renders on-the-fly.

In CasparCG, you can also use HTML pages that have transparency and it will still render a proper key and fill. So that could be a good route as well."
YouShouldKnow,fg5szc5,t1_fg5pcyb,1580537742.0,"While I agree with being polite, etc.,  you should probably avoid saying you were distracted, especially if it's not true. They could hit you with a distracted driving ticket with a potentially higher penalty. I tried using that excuse when I got my first ticket in 2002, he was not happy and I had to go to court over it. Fortunately it didn't end up as much as it could have been, but $200 for 19 year old me was a pretty good hit to the wallet."

YouShouldKnow,fdmfoux,t1_fdl8cw4,1578548353.0,"I got tagged by an Idaho State Police officer like 11 years ago. He was going the opposite direction on the freeway and I was doing 89 in a 75, he clocked me at 85, and the median was pretty a pretty good size so he was a fair distance away from me. He turned around and crossed the median pretty quickly. It was surprising to say the least."
YouShouldKnow,fdl84q6,t1_fdl526l,1578518660.0,"I lived a short stint (10 months) in Vegas. I got pulled over my first week. I was in the right lane driving just fine, he turned on his lights, so I pulled into a parking lot. He asks me if I know why he pulled me over, I said no. I was going the speed limit, I hadn't recently changed lanes, pretty much anything I could think of, I had done right to my knowledge. 

He then says he pulled me over because I didn't signal when I turned into the parking lot, which I only turned into because he had his lights on. Basically it sounds like he only pulled me over because I had out of state plates and he was trying to find anything wrong he could use against me."

AmItheAsshole,fd9zb6t,t1_fd9xzgk,1578239824.0,"If it's above 71 while I sleep (and that's pushing it), I will wake up with a pretty nasty headache, not to mention sweating all night. I could not handle it if it was stuck at 78.

My house is set to 68 pretty much year round, all day/night unless it gets really cold. Then I might bump it up a couple degrees."
