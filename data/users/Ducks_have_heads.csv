The main ingredients you want to avoid are peas/lentils, legumes, potato/sweet potato.

  


Given the at risk nature of the breeds I'd be very cautious with what you feed.

  


I'll also add the FDA has only had 500 or so cases reported in relation to DCM, 119 resulting in death. So the risk seems to be low and not really the epidemic people on this sub make it out to be, but the risk is still there for you to judge yourself.

Additionally, the top quality brands like hills and purina for example are probably the only ones that do any serious research and development into there diets"

Spending time with him is awesome but Dogs aren't great at excerising them selves, so having a free roam of the yard probably isn't stimulating enough for him and he'll definitely need more than a 15 minute walk. It depends a lot on the individual dog but 30minutes a day would be absolute minimum, with a maybe 20-30 minutes of high intensity play like fetch or something. If your dog is tired and stimulated (both physically and intellectually) then he's less likely to be bored and chew things. It'll also likely help with his need to play with N.

  


A well exercised dog is also much easier to train when they get a lot of energy out.

The seperation anxiety is difficult. There's plenty of resources online/YouTube regarding that (hint: exercise is likely to help a little here).

  


I would also recommend giving him two separate meals as well. That way he's not hungry and knows he'll get more food later and be more content.

Good luck!"

My other suggestion is you should be encouraging your roommate to get a dog rather than getting one yourself. Because you get all the benefits of having a dog (the social aspect, interaction etc) with none of the downside (associated costs, difficulty with future plans etc ). Then when you move out and know where you are after college you can get your own dog. Particularly true of you're Ben without experience raising a dog.

I'm thinking maybe you may want to really think about getting a dog and spend a lot more time around them before diving in here. There are certain things about dogs that you just can't change. Hair, barking, slobber, and poo is all part of the package with pretty much every dog.

I'm no expert on the cocker spaniels so hopefully, someone who knows the breed well can give you better advice but they might be a pretty good option for you. They do have a lot of hair and are social dogs so may not do well in a kennel all the time (most dogs won't). Not letting them upstairs is fine as long as you and your partner don't spend much of your waking time up there. Dogs aren't just there for a walk in the woods to be ignored in a kennel later, they still need your time and attention throughout the day/evenings"

If.you can give me a clear example of an area that's currently on fire that the fire services wanted to burn but couldn't because of legislation that is responsible for the massive loss then I'm all for it.

  


Even if I take your story about Gippsland at face value and the protesters halted the planned burning, Causing those fires then that's unfortunate. But It's a minor fire compared to NSW etc which you can't blame on them."
daverubin,fd7tvrt,t1_fd7rksr,1578210028.0,"That's not my opinion mate, that's the fire services opinion. Most of the planned prescribed burning was done. Where it wasn't was because the weather. Protesters and legislation has Fuck all to do with it. For someone who distrusts governments so much, you sure eat up their propaganda easily."
daverubin,fd7quwj,t1_fd7q8i4,1578208669.0,"Gippsland wasn't trying to burn in winter. That's the point. And There's still less rainfall making it drier, do I need to give you a clue as to why that is?

Deliberately starting a fire you can't control is fucking stupid."
daverubin,fd7p9r7,t1_fd7o98g,1578207972.0,"Notice how you didn't answer the question? There has been more prescribed burning than ever. Yet these fires are the worst we've seen. The main reason there hasn't been burning in some places is because it's been too dry to do so safety, not because of protesters.

  


> if we emitted 0% tomorrow it wouldn’t make a difference to the fires here,

Of course it wouldn't. The severity of the fires now have nothing to do with the CO2 we (globally) released yesterday, but with the trillions of tons of it over the last 100 years."

daverubin,fd7lfgv,t1_fd6r9wz,1578206293.0,"Of course he won't. It goes against his preconceived ideas without a clear or obvious falsehood for him to spit out and pretend it's a rebuttal. This whole ""lefties are actually responsible for the fires and definitely not those who are in charge"" is just right wing propoganda and projection used to hide from their responsibility and inaction.

Edit: also, there's no way /u/Rennta27  is elderly. He's can't be more than 14 years old. And it's ok to be a virgin. There's nothing wrong with that Renny. You'll find that special someone one day."
daverubin,fd6l09i,t1_fd6hzaj,1578192574.0,The last few years have seen more prescribed burning than previously. So why are the fires so much worse now than they have ever been?

daverubin,fd6dqqv,t3_ek5rfc,1578189418.0,"Totally, the prescribed burning (that still took place from what i could see) protesters in Vic are totally responsible for the massive fires in NSW. More fantastic work from Renny and the gang at r/climateskeptics."
dataisbeautiful,fd5zvnn,t1_fd5puex,1578183605.0,How many gallons in a January?
dataisbeautiful,fd5zid9,t1_fd5ycuv,1578183473.0,"The largest fire has burnt approximately 718,357 football fields."
AusFinance,fd5hzng,t1_fd1ml4m,1578177870.0,I definitely saw a few people predicting 60% drops. Although pretty sure it was wishful thinking.
