NoStupidQuestions,ffp3bnw,t1_ffoyl1h,1580085441.0,Cabin in the Woods is amazing. It broke so many horror tropes.
cats,ffp35a7,t3_eu9r7f,1580085316.0,"Aw man, I'm so sorry for your loss. 6 and a half is so young. Poor baby."
OldSchoolCool,ffp2two,t3_eud9u1,1580085095.0,"Aw, they look so happy and comfortable with each other."
AskReddit,ffirwjg,t1_ffi39m2,1579981176.0,"I always imagine the characters riding in the car in awkward silence until they reach their destination and start talking again, like they didnt just pause the conversation for a good 30 minutes."
AskReddit,ffirmmj,t3_etohsu,1579980980.0,When a character visits their old bedroom at their parents house and all their shit is still there. Like they took absolutely nothing with them when they moved out.
BikiniBottomTwitter,ffec1jj,t3_esybam,1579842654.0,I can hear this meme
horror,ff875pf,t3_es54hr,1579667917.0,"My first introduction to horror was when I was maybe 5. I watched my dad play an old DOS game called Phantasmagoria. That game is responsible for maybe my first nightmare.

Then, in 4th grade, I read Coraline and I loved it. Then I found my mom's Stephen King collection in 5th grade and read Eyes of the Dragon.

Pretty much been in love with all things horror since."
AskReddit,ff86s06,t1_ff6uugz,1579667597.0,This reminded me of that 1000 Ways to Die episode where some chick got a live fish lodged in her throat. The fish's scales worked the same way and she died because she couldnt pull it out.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fev7sgx,t3_eqkfwt,1579394207.0,"Pet fees really suck for those of us who know how to properly care for the pet and how to clean up after it. It's not that hard to make sure your place doesnt go to shit because of your animal. Some people just dont care and unfortunately, those people are really screwing the responsible ones over."
thesims,felz40f,t3_epq74u,1579234679.0,"Thank

God!

This has been a considerable source of frustration for me when I play."
AskReddit,fellhv1,t1_felk2y7,1579225028.0,That made me forcefully blow air out my nose.

patientgamers,fekn7vm,t1_fek7g2c,1579203559.0,"You may not enjoy it, then. It honestly doesnt offer much more than 5. The story itself is ""meh"" but I love it because it's a fantastic time-waster. If you go into it not expecting too much then you probably won't be let down."
patientgamers,fek57d2,t1_feje5n3,1579192855.0,"5 is great. I had so much fun with it. New Dawn is pretty fun, too."

Whatcouldgowrong,feihn7o,t1_feh36bz,1579138746.0,So glad the dog is okay but also very glad to hear she took full blame for her actions.
videos,febdi7i,t1_feanh0u,1578957699.0,That was rough. Oof.
AskReddit,fe0r311,t1_fe04gkj,1578817697.0,"No, you're not wrong. Like you said, its subjective. Which is one of the best parts of art, in my opinion. Hearing different opinions adds more life to the subject, whether you agree with said opinion or not.

You're good, dude."
suggestmeabook,fe05qkt,t3_enakx4,1578803721.0,"I'm not entirely sure this book fits the bill, but my go-to book when I'm feeling bad is The Help. 

I'm so sorry about your recent discovery. I send you lots of love and well wishes for a healthy outcome."
DaysGone,fe02ytb,t3_engdlo,1578801770.0,This is *amazing*! Nice job!
AskReddit,fe029tu,t1_fdzl9ho,1578801277.0,"Because I didnt like 2 of the 15 movies we watched? I mean, I may have an unpopular opinion about a well-loved movie but damn, dude."
AskReddit,fe023g7,t1_fdzk8yg,1578801154.0,"Not necessarily.  But, considering the characters in the movie, I was expecting more shoot outs."
AskReddit,fdzdxbm,t1_fdz9p1z,1578789345.0,You're not the only one. I had to watch 1 & 2 for a film class and it was painful. I was expecting a shit ton more action but all I got was a shit ton of talking. Super boring.
crafts,fdlwd3k,t3_elz7c5,1578534085.0,Very cool. Kind of reminds me of Kida's necklace from Atlantis.
cats,fdhlukj,t1_fdfpwsq,1578425394.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. It's such an awful experience. Love and hugs to you as well!
AskReddit,fdfjktp,t3_ekxp60,1578363214.0,"Weeds. It eventually turned into ""who is Nancy gonna fuck in order to get out of *this* situation?""

And that least season. So, so bad."
AskReddit,fdfiven,t1_fdf9dth,1578362738.0,"Oh, how the turns have tabled."
AskReddit,fdfikq6,t3_el2az5,1578362539.0,Adam from The Goldbergs. Hard no.
cats,fdezoc4,t1_fdeyiks,1578350032.0,That's really beautiful. What a positive way to look at it. Thank you.
Anxiety,fdexkxd,t3_eky4ct,1578348732.0,"For me, the worst part about having anxiety is that I know nothing is wrong, really. I can be thinking completely logically while having an attack and yet, my body still freaks out. It sucks."
AskReddit,fdchxht,t1_fda1bzf,1578275329.0,Same. I went and saw the one that came put in 2018. It's like 2 1/2 hours long and I was aware of time passing the entire time.
horror,fdc3jbi,t1_fdbzm97,1578266399.0,"Really? Aw man, I dunno if I wanna read the book now..."
horror,fdbt8qv,t1_fdbjtiy,1578261647.0,"I can understand that. I personally loved the 1st season so much, I binged it in a day. I would say that the 2nd season isnt really worth watching, unfortunately. There are a few good characters that get introduced, but what the writers did with Joe just irritates me like none other. They kinda turned him into a reckless idiot."
horror,fda9goo,t1_fda5ns6,1578243264.0,Absolutely! I finished it yesterday and would say it's one of the better books I've read recently.
FoodPorn,fda31ng,t1_fda06at,1578241057.0,You've made my day. Thank you!!
horror,fda1uwu,t1_fd7kygp,1578240758.0,I watched the show before I read the book and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The series left quite a bit out. Even more so for the 2nd season. I've been told the 2nd book is very different from the 2nd season.
AskReddit,fd7aeye,t3_ek6xma,1578201550.0,All the info from the library of Alexandria.
horror,fd79x0f,t3_ek5699,1578201353.0,"So, I'm gonna disagree with season 2 being better. 

But yes, YOU is totally worth the time. The book, of course, is even better.

You wanna be disgusted, creeped out by, and also kinda sympathize with a psycho stalker? YOU is definitely the show to watch/book to read."
FoodPorn,fd797lv,t3_ek5fk0,1578201086.0,"Ugh, those look amazing. Dumplings are my weakness. Recipe, please?"
IASIP,fd3iaqh,t3_ejv8ej,1578158568.0,"So, just finished season 2 of YOU and just finished the book. While there are similarities, Dennis is far more selfish and aware than Joe. All that Joe does, he thinks he does it for love. He is delusional whereas Dennis is kinda psychotic, yes, but hes semi-aware of it and doesnt care. Lol."
AskWomen,fcweoj5,t3_ej3cbf,1578023710.0,"Try to talk to them. That typically doesnt work, so I end it. For me, a relationship is a partnership.  I'm okay with picking up more than my fair share occasionally, but if its 90% or more of the time, nope. Not gonna work."
RoomPorn,fcw77ap,t3_ej03c4,1578018726.0,I dont think I'm rich enough to even be looking at this.
horrorlit,fcstweh,t3_eiiv2p,1577924994.0,"I dont think it's technically classified as horror, perhaps thriller, but YOU by Caroline Kepnes is so good! The main character is so unsettling and yet you can oddly sympathize with him at times."
AskReddit,fcqy233,t1_fcpy0wp,1577893934.0,"Thank you. 

Unfortunately, she did not. She passed away in 2015 from cirrhosis of the liver."
horrorlit,fcnbnnw,t3_ei3jo7,1577808181.0,"Horrorstör and My Best Friend's Exorcism by Grady Hendrix. Neither were scary in the least and the characters were mostly irritating. 

We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson. It wasnt bad but absolutely not what I was expecting. The ending was...frustrating. 

The Woman in the Window by A.J. Flinn. I couldnt even finish this one it was so bad."
AskReddit,fcjexp9,t3_ehg5ac,1577685160.0,"When my mom was alive, she was severely alcoholic. One day, I must have been around 12, I asked her if she could take me to town to finish getting stuff for a Halloween party I was throwing that week. So, we get in the car, my 5 year old brother with us, and she was swerving all over the road, laughing about how bad she was driving. I hadn't noticed how drunk she was until we were already on the way to town. We get to town, shop, and then on the way out of the building, I told her I refused to ride home with her. I had such a bad feeling in my stomach, I thought I was gonna be sick. We had a shouting match about it for a bit. I finally grabbed my brothers hand and just started walking home. Luckily, someone had noticed she was smashed and called the cops. She was arrested and taken to jail before she had the chance to drive home. But I shudder to think about what would have happened had I got back in the car.

tl;dr: extremely drunk mom tried to drive me and my little brother home"
