I genuinely believe it's getting harder to get away with this crap thanks to social media and technology but is obviously going to take a lot of effort on the part of authorities. We aren't living in printed press days now, there is a lot more pressure from the public and it is going to be far harder to sweep this stuff under the rug."

AskReddit,fbwcegk,t3_ecsjbt,1577146234.0,"I mean, speaking objectively I can't think of a better candidate than Skyrim.

This is a game that has dropped on basically every console, has a ton of content and replay value as you can roll multiple classes (even though we all roll sneaky thieves every time -- I mean c'mon), has one of the largest and friendliest modding communities out there who have created TONS of mods including entire expansions, and has inspired a wealth of other games that have come after.

I haven't played Skyrim in quite some time, but it's one of those games you can come back to over and over. It definitely deserves to be up there with the big dogs if not no.1."
