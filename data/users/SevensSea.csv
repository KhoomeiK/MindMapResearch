Like seriously you ever drive through the ghetto and see what this shit is like in the world around you? No you don't because you're so afraid to go near there yet you think people are supposed to come out of there as a trauma inflicted grossly influenced teenager with anything remotely resembling what was handed down to you with ease? Fuck that and fuck the fact that people can look at these things as simple matters of opinion when these are the other human beings the actual non supply side Jesus told you we were supposed to be focused on helping; not building churches across the street from every starbucks.

unpopularopinion,ffdipq6,t1_ffbw0vm,1579821710.0,There are 18 year olds in high school. If cigs and alcohol are legal for 18 year olds it becomes exponentially more available to younger high school kids. On a logical level it may not make sense in some capacities but on a practical level the reduction of drinking age would have terrible effects. And sure if we want to nullify the whole old enough to go to war not old enough to drink conundrum then just make military personell with ID exempt to the drinking age law because they're obviously under more scrutiny than the average 18 year old when it comes to public behavior and obeying laws. And I'm sure at some point in their military career they could use a good drink.

I know this will sound rude but it applies to everyone who compares their old CoD games experiences to now; you used to merk 9-14 year olds all day you were never actually good. Reaction time is easily maintained. If you stop playing shooters for a few years in your 30s maybe you would be ever so slightly slower on reaction time; the main things you would have to get back though are aim and overall cognition, but if Drdisrespect can compete pretty decently with pro players at 37 years old I would say the brain is certainly capable of maintaining reaction time. Im 33 and have only gotten better at shooters, with both aim and reaction time. I had over a 4kda in MW2 and got a few nukes but I know I was half as good back then at shooters because I improved dramatically on PC on multiple shooters and learned to track/flick properly and predict enemy movement more. Its a lot easier when there's no MMR so 80% of enemies are terrible or new and dont even know the maps while you know everything about the game and how to exploit perks and run around with overpowered silenced smgs sniping people with them in 5 quick auto aim assisted shots; because that was MW2, merking noobs until you run into someone else who is as sweaty as you.

The funniest part is the coward cop is actually an emotional manchild look at how he walks away while he starts to revert to cussing. This is the behavior of a 13 year old boy, walking away while cussing at someone. Like he doesn't have the balls to say it while standing still, not like that would be any better; just shows how much of a punkass bitch he is inside that he can't stay put when he gets angry he has to walk away while cussing. I work at a juvenile hall and end up trying to explain this to the boys with anger issues all the time; controlling your emotions is more manly than cussing at people and throwing a tantrum. Only difference is this isn't a horomonal insecure confused teenager this is supposed to be an adult. If this is how this cop behaves on duty how many times has he cussed out his wife if he has one?"

Christianity,fehbe6n,t3_eouhjb,1579113078.0,"You are not your specific church and you are not your parents. Take heart that not every God fearing Christian is a fundamentalist. Its a big world and you have a lot of growth to do as an individual. Your purpose in life may in fact not be to just support a husband. Unlike everyone around you God sees our inner hearts and thoughts. Don't be ashamed that you have legitimate questions about things; turning away from the overbearing overapplication of unadaptive dogma does not mean you are turning from God. You are allowed to think for yourself, to wrestle with God on science and scripture. You will be better for it. The more important question other than all the extra junk that people like to pile on to our religion; Who do you say Jesus is? Is he a prophet, just a nice guy who says nice things, an extremely elaborate fabrication, or the son of God? You can follow Him without following your parents expectations, without holding to multigenerational cult like societal norms. Essentially what I'm saying is you can make a change without thinking you are betraying God or rebelling. You are incorrectly tying thoughts of your parents and your church with thoughts of God. God is not imperfect as your parents are, and He is not imperfect as your church is. He knows the turmoil within you now and He can see you through it. Whatever you end up doing, I pray you are blessed and strong in faith."

In a way I can understand on a much smaller scale how the conductor feels. Because even though logically I can say to myself there was nothing I could do differently I still feel the burden of it as if it somehow falls on me. I've never been in an accident and havent had a ticket in a decade; these strays in my city just literally dart out in front of your car and stop as if they realized their mistake and want to go back the other way.

PoliticalHumor,fduqyj9,t1_fdt9phe,1578737613.0,"I recently started teaching my 5 year old daughter some US history. I started with kids biography books on Washington, Adams, and Jefferson. Somewhere in there around where it said Washington said no to being a king I explained like she was 5 what I think a lot of people tend to forget. ""Every 4 years we vote for a new president to make sure that we always have someone good leading and taking care of the people; not a bad guy like the king in England was.""

Now it feels like the sentiment is ""please rule over us; if you wear our team's colors we will worship you and applaud every decision you make and everything you say."" It's gone beyond confirmation bias to just straight up tell me what to believe and I'll believe it.

Edit: and before someone points out the founding fathers are far from perfect I'm aware but not quite explaining all of their faults in detail to my 5 year old yet; it's a lot of information to try and get across as it is. Its also hard enough just to try to tone down the historical propaganda of these books because its almost comical.

House: the constitution requires congressional approval for acts of war with another country. 

While I think there is hypocrisy from the left in that they have also enabled the overstepping of the executive in foreign affairs in previous administrations, this is exactly how things are supposed to go and anyone who thinks the executive should just take these actions without congressional approval is basically sucking the government off and needs to get a grip on reality.  Trump isn't your best friend in the world you don't need to white knight him and the best presidents were those who recognized the need for the executive to cede power to other branches. These are fundamental beliefs that we are not a monarchy in the slightest and the potential tyranny of one man is to be reigned in are why our government is set up the way it is; term limits, checks and balances, etc. If you dont believe the constitution was set up properly in this way then maybe you're just a fanboy not worth talking to. The government isn't 2 sports teams all executives should be subject to scrutiny it's how its set up. I realize post 9/11 measures have been put in place to allow certain continual actions without declarations of war; but what success have we gained while thousands of US troops have died while killing thousands of innocent civilians throughout the middle east? Every individual attack made by this country aside from specific defensive emergencies should require congressional approval; that way a large group of elected officials can evaluate the need vs risk of these attacks; and factors such as hey maybe its not a good idea to kill dozens of innocent civilians who are unwittingly and unluckily just on the same block as a terrorist. If it takes a terrorist act to kill a terrorist then aren't we all just terrorists? In any case if they want to do that they can have it properly approved and not just 1 man deciding the fate of the middle east."

Ultimately restoration to a healthy marriage is the goal and it would be ideal if he could be good enough at actively listening while you are good enough at actively telling him how severe of a problem something is that you don't have to discipline him like you're his mother. Not that I blame you given the circumstances just saying the wifi shut off tactic is indicative of a larger communication problem. If you have issues with him in the future and there's no shut off valve easy solution then how do you deal with it other than eventual divorce? Lets think towards the goal of non divorce since that would be better for the kids. Yes he is being an asshole but obviously he can be convinced to become a better father if he is sat down and talked to appropriately. Apparently yall need marital counseling; and that's not your fault you aren't the asshole just trying to point out the practical goal here and that things need to be accomplished in this relationship or its just going to die.

He didn't think of this the same day he posted it on reddit. It's apparent that these are concepts he has been intentionally practicing himself for some time. And he's confident in it because it works and he has his own life as evidence.

Edit: ok done with edits on grammar and spelling now."

PewdiepieSubmissions,fd21zgk,t3_ejser2,1578140420.0,"I know its all memes and people like to joke but if your depression gets legitimately worse from internet usage like that of browsing reddit or social media please consider taking breaks from the interwebs. Stepping away from the internet can be a thing you know, but its almost seen as abnormal behavior nowadays. Don't let your fear of looking like a crazy 2007 britney spears keep you from the metamorphosis that can happen when you become a crazy 2007 britney spears. If we never get fed up with mundane we will always be mundane. The internet can be a great place, a phone can be a great device; but we can't let ourselves become consumed by them when theres a bright real world out there that has a whole different message for us. Im really really high right now so I might be talking out of my ass but I'm pretty sure some of what I said may or may not be true so take it with a grain of rice and say 5/7 a perfect score."
CrappyDesign,fd20tbi,t3_ejt2uy,1578139877.0,Well I would think this is just referring to the natural fact of life that if you don't have arms or even if they are just broken your mom can always lend you a hand.

mildlyinfuriating,fcirx8p,t1_fcijvvq,1577668378.0,"they aren't terrible if you like paying more for the same specs and like being limited on what you can download onto your phone and not use wired earbuds without an adapter. Phones should still have removable batteries but apple lead the way in showing the world of smartphones that if you limit the consumer you can just get them to buy new phones every 2-4 years since their phone will perform terribly on a dead battery. They are a company that does this sort of limit the consumer tactic on everything; most notoriously with iMac's costing thousands to repair proprietary parts which they purposefully make difficult for non-apple technicians to repair. If it wasn't for apple pioneering these tactics I could still have my battery charging station where I just swap out batteries as I go without ever charging my phone. But no, people have to be fanboys of companies that shit on consumers because they are susceptible to advertising and what is popular and couldn't care less."

Also you can lose your $10 earbuds and just go buy new ones, they don't sound any worse and the cord turns out doesn't hurt you or anything, hell you can even hide it in your shirt while your phone is in your pocket."

science,fc6j3bx,t1_fc5xafp,1577481784.0,Uhh I would have been fired at my job if my union didn't exist and purchase an attorney to defend me when I needed it because the company was trying to smear my character over some BS. My wife however got fired over some BS working at a hospital because they had no union. Contacted attorneys and no one wanted to take the case because she had no union therefore she was at will and they can fire her for anything even if she had worked there 7 years with no discipline. As long as they didn't actually discriminate against a special class the company can fire you. But yeah being an at-will employee is GREAT. Having no legal or other recourse to someone firing you over basically nothing is GREAT for human stability and mental health! Maybe you've never worked for a company ran by assholes who are out to oppress their own workers but unions aren't useless as you say. They negotiate contracts for better pay/benefits and rules and protect the workers from harassment and being fired for no good reason. Sorry but just because you haven't personally seen unions be usefull in whatever bubble of a career you live in that doesn't mean they are in fact generally useless.
