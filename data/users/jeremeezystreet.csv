Second, I think it warrants more experimentation. Even without any electrical devices downstairs, you've still got wiring and outlets that can give off EMFs.

1.) Film what you do down there. You'll want to reference it later.

2.) Don't hold the reader in your hand, leave it somewhere static, unmoving like a table, so your subtle movements don't cause it to enter and exit static fields.

3.) Do everything you do downstairs in an entirely different place for a control. Maybe your backyard, or a non-""haunted"" room in your house."
Paranormal,ff74ley,t3_erzk26,1579641008.0,"It's the biggest problem with these occurrences imo. It's literally not ghosts, I'm positive of it. I call them ghosts for the sake of simplicity, but I'm certain they're not dead people.

I think it's the quirks of the presence of higher dimensions. Things that move on their own? They look like they're quantum-entangled with something. Reacting to forces enacted on something else. Typically it's only subatomic particles that act like this, but hey. I'm not going to pretend humanity is aware of all phenomena.

Apparitions look like 4th dimensional entities or objects passing through our 3rd dimensional plane; Like a 3D catscan. They appear in pieces, growing from and shrinking to nothingness. I've never seen these in person though, not directly. 

I tend to disregard orbs, visual and audial phenomena and emotional phenomena because those can be explained. EMFs can make you hallucinate and affect you emotionally, orbs can easily be dust or bugs most times. But how do you explain things that are taped? Filmed? Things that move on their own?

This ridiculous, confirmation biased notion that you don't have to worry about dying because ghosts exist is completely undermining any semblance of a possibility that these instances will ever be investigated; You'll be laughed at by anyone in science because people all over subreddits like this one wanna say ""Oh spirits like this, ghosts like that. Throw salt over your shoulder and fist a black cat to rid yourself of demons."" If you ever catch someone saying they know a damned thing about this type of shit then tell them to shut the fuck up, that they're surpressing progress. They're vomiting their stupid, desperate caveman beliefs all over one of the last pieces of science that remains under our noses."
