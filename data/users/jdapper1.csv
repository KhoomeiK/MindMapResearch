Showerthoughts,ff7spjq,t1_ff6xlpj,1579657432.0,There are delivery companies in the US that give their drivers fake wallets with a couple bucks cash as part of their training in case they are robbed.
tall,feypea0,t3_eqs45h,1579448662.0,"I am 6'6"" and have found that a big part of Detroit does not build cars for tall people anymore.

GM products have too low ceilings and are difficult to see out of. Chrysler builds the front consoles that narrow in at the knee so your legs are turned to an uncomfortable angle to avoid getting irritated by the width of the console.

Fords are a little better.

The Japanese on the other hand have gone out of their way to make comfortable cars for tall guys. Toyota and Nissan (last 4 cars in the family, including my 6'3"" son have been Nissan). Although even Mitsubishi is not too bad. I had 3 generations of the Eclipse, and all three were a nice confy ride although low to the ground. I looked like a spider climbing out and got some chuckles. 

Look at Nissan, even their smaller cars have lots of headroom and a good view out the windshield."

todayilearned,fesqm2z,t1_feso5pq,1579367993.0,"I was talking to some friends of mine the other day telling them how I ended up in Orlando and told them my story. Now I linked the article for them.
Frank was featured in the Orlando Business Journal in about 2005 as some heroic figure. I reached out to the reporter and told him my story. He said he had gotten similar calls to mine. A few years later I saw another story about Frank going to jail and claiming to be Ezekiel. 
Anyway I am glad you shared this.
I survived and probably will be better off than some. But I will never be the same."

This clown is personally responsible for ruining my life financially. I will likely never be able to retire thanks to this guy.
I worked for one on the companies he ""rescued"" in South Florida in the early 2000's.
I was tipped off to something was wrong when my w2 was for a perfectly even number.
I was shown paperwork and given a ""corrected"" w2. A few months later the sheriff's office padlocked the building I was working in and gave me 10 minutes to get my tools out.
Next, 6 of my paychecks that had been deposited and spent were rendered ""retroactively nsf"". I got hit with return check fees, bank penalties, got eviction notices, had to pull all my 401k (from a previous employer) and borrow about $10,000 from my parents to keep from becoming homeless and losing my car.
Then I broke my ankle. Turns out he wasn't paying the insurance premiums he was taking out of my check, I needed a job and had to tape my ankle because no one will hire a tradesman in a cast. My 401k statements were falsified, so that money was gone, he wasn't sending the IRS what was coming out of my check, Social Security,  yeah, no.
All in all this guy wrecked me for $35,000 in wages and and additional $100,000 (interest, fines, late fees, medical bills, etc.) in money that I had to cough up.
I am one of about 70 ordinary people in the Ft Lauderdale and Orlando areas that I know of that he did like this. 
I filed in the bankruptcy court. But I was behind hundreds of others.
What a douchebag."

unpopularopinion,felea3j,t1_fekep6x,1579220139.0,"My great grandparents came to the US in the late 1890's from Lithuania. Not as bad as Jews faced under the Nazis but they fled as Russia moved in and outlawed their language both written and spoken. If you didn't speak Russian, you didn't work and you starved. 
Does America have problems? Yes. But I would rather be able to vote people in or out than have to flee."
IAmA,fekloxr,t1_fek2rt1,1579202648.0,That is freaking horrible. I truly hope you find healing and remain safe.
