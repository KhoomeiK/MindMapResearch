We went out to eat together as well. One day it did came down to me confessing, but she wanted to remain friends. She told me she liked me for who I was, but didn't have romantic feelings for me.

I eventually stopped hanging out for a while while barely messaging her. After a few month I came to terms on what happened and decided that I wanted to be friends with her because she is a great person to be around.

Take your time and tell her that if you ever want to be friends again, that you will contact her."
