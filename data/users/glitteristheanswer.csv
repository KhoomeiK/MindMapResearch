If you realize your beliefs would be very different with different friends maybe you need some friend cleanup. 

Are you someone too who has friends from hs or earlier as an adult? That's nice, but if they're your closest or only friends theres a good chance you havent matured or grown since that age and you've got a lot of work to do."

So truly I wonder if ma y of the people who buy this shit werent abused as kids. I know that seems harsh but it seems most of us that were abused growing up and gtfo got our red flag danger alarm bells tipped off EARLY in this trend and never bought it because the gymnastics and a lot of triangulation and other techniques are exactly almost verbatimwhats used by abusive narcissists and sociopaths. 

I'm not saying everyone should be abused to ha w a grasp of reality but this is yet another reason why skimming abuse recovery forums (not commenting, just reading) is helpful for those it doesnt apply to because you can spot the bs better

AskReddit,ffj63pj,t3_ett7fr,1579991344.0,"Being born to abusive parents. 

As much as well meaning positive people want to think, theres really no real recovery from this. Most therapists, even ones who specialise in trauma and abuse are beyond useless, and even the most self aware and go getter individuals are never going to really escape the damage that's been done. I dont blame those who had ok lives and have well wishes like ""itll get better!"", they mean well. But it 99% likely won't,  or only in small ways that don't tip the scale. 

I'm aware being born to the wrong people isnt my fault but feel it needs being said here because there are so many that havent connected the dots and while they're self aware enough not to hurt others they might think a lot of things that arent their fault are. See: many comments in this thread"

I tend to go for the throat these days. 

Like yesterday my mom decided she was coming up to visit me. They live two hours away and the city I live in has good food. However my mom does the same thing when she visits every time: criticizes my apartment for being dirty based on messes my roommates made and never cleaned (my room is spotless, I make my bed with hospital corners...clearly not someone who'd crack qn egg on a countertop and leave it), talks shit that destroys what little balance I have with my roommates, and goes to the same boring restaurants near my school. 
My stoned ass the night before actually did a good thing: said let's go eat at x. X had been on dads bucket list for years, he's obsessed with weird restaurant food channel stuff and this is a historical site. I hadn't been yet either so if I'm gonna be abused at least let's do something different. Mom decided to start shit almost immediately. She's a cosigner on my lease so I had to tell her this: my roommates are beyond terrible in entitled ways that have been ruining my health (not just mental health) , and that while I wanted to tell the new manager the truth the second I walked in I got a gut feeling she'd snitch. Hadn't even found a place to move to yet or new roommate so didnt need a shot to my foot. Said i was in a big interview process that's in the works for job in another city 6h away. Since I already work freelance in a field mainly in that city it has some truthiness to it. Said dont tell my roommate/her coworker because it might be premature, and she did of course so that test was needed. I couldnt imagine the temper tantrum I'd come home to if I told the truth. Just briefed both my parents saying this is what's going on, i might've already found a better roommate where i *want* to live but please just dont say anything around the current roomie. 
Dad was just upset I lied, why didnt I just discreetly tell the truth to the manager? Explained to him the lack of professionalism after my mom screamed at me for a while and angrily stormed out. After that dad understood it seems or at least understood I have this somewhat under control and I'm not stupid. She just screamed that basically I should lie down and take the abuse from my roommates, quit yelling at her no wonder why no one likes me, and got pissed when i shot back that i dont allow people as insolent as her in my presence for more than three mistakes, and yelling is the argumentative tactic of cowards who have nothing to say so if all she was going to do is talk over me and yell she can leave. She left while saying I'm embarrassing myself.

No I'm not, unlike you mom I have a fucking spine. 

Dad's idea if a bad roommate is what I'd call a neutral roommate. We did the next thing in his bucket list next and mom butched and complained the whole way. Random shitty excuses like whole we're driving shes too tired and cant drive - either of us could drive just pull over. Nope. She really ruined the day.
I hope my dad had an ok time despite her though because it's rare she let's him do something he wants and he was clearly having a field day."
