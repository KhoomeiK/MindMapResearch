confessions,ffgr0ag,t1_ffgqj5u,1579912849.0,"There’s this cop that I watched about on YouTube. He was a cannibalism cop and had an urge wanting to eat up women. And it all began with a thought. So, regardless of what other Redditors say on here, not everyone is always right.

Check out this link, if you wanna learn more about this cop and his thoughts, leading up to what he did:  [Cannibal Cop](https://youtu.be/ee1Mkw0uiYo)"

confessions,ffg0yui,t3_etfow9,1579896095.0,You might need a therapist about this... Thinking can lead to some other dangerous form. So be careful.
depression,ff49x4f,t3_erkenj,1579558736.0,"It’s alright, you’re not the only one who has the nostalgia feelings when looking back at old memories and photos. I cry so much and feel like there’s a heavy burden on my chest when I flip through my childhood photos. We all get old, but it’s best to not think about what’s the future like dying or getting old even though we are and we will. Just try to focus on the present, live life to whatever you can possibly can. Be you. Take care of yourself man!"
depression,fepll45,t3_eqc1r3,1579323706.0,"From the way you typed this, I could obviously tell you’re a gentle and kind soul. You said you listen to others but when you talk to your people about your own personal problems, they eventually drift away. 

Unfortunately, or fortunately, whatever you think, many of us are on the same boat as you. It sucks that we can’t depend on anyone we think we could like our family members or relatives and or close friends. I think you can use the internet as your guide and your pal/help, here, you can rent to some stranger, they’ll still listen and read what you type. DM if you want, stay strong. One day you’ll find better people who’ll listen to you always. Believe it"
confessions,fepl8kp,t3_eqc28w,1579323442.0,"No you’re not a failure. You exist for a reason, and believe it or not, you have a purpose. You could have the most hardest job, the easiest or slummiest job but it still makes an impact to us as well. Please don’t commit suicide, I’m a stranger, I am with you on the same boat, please, you’re stronger than this and I want you to use as much strength you’ve got to get out of this thought. It’s tough, I know, I’ve been there. You’re not alone. *virtual hugs* stay strong, DM me if you need to, I’ll respond when I get back."
Advice,fecawrm,t3_eoexnx,1578969827.0,"I’ve had those pains too but honestly feel like Google doesn’t have the answer. I feel like this might be common, but I don’t know the answer as to why it happens. Just remember to take good care of yourself! Goodnight."
Paranormal,feax90h,t3_enwojj,1578953144.0,"Maybe? I think you should begin praying. And enchant pure and heavenly words or something to scare away the devil. Let the light open in, don’t make your house have all closed binds or curtains."
Paranormal,feaupzu,t1_feak4cz,1578952345.0,I trust you.
Paranormal,feah5b3,t1_fe6bpl2,1578948644.0,Oh... Thank you for letting me know. Now I’m a bit freaked out knowing that it’s demonic related. :(

Advice,fe5zgrd,t3_enwtws,1578878383.0,"You’re not the only one who feels this way. Trust me, there’s a lot of other students your age, maybe some older or younger, but there’s a lot like you on the same page. Do you think you feel low all the time? Could be depression or some other mental disorder. And it might be caused by disturbances in your home, family problems and etc? I don’t know. 

Usually, when I can’t focus on anything in school. I go home and turn on my favorite song playlist and I do my schoolwork. Sometimes school isn’t the best place for you to really focus. For me, it’s anxiety, I can’t focus when there’s too many students around me. I hope you the best. Whatever it is, you can do it, I believe in you."
Paranormal,fe5x5ut,t1_fe5skqc,1578876928.0,"Yes it is weird. And phew, it’s good to know I’m not the only one who about beaming ore lights that exploded. The whistle was low to the floor. 

The oink sound was very loud, loud. I’ve only heard it around 3-4 times already, but it doesn’t happen anymore. And it only oinked once, i hope there’s no dying pig in the shrine or my dad’s room though ."
u_icebeaee,fe3k1jg,t1_fe3bik8,1578849974.0,Thank you.
depression,fdytdhd,t3_endn4j,1578783408.0,"It’s not your fault. It was her choice and decision to kill herself, sometimes you can’t really help out someone who just can’t take it anymore. Don’t blame yourself."
Advice,fdrv3eb,t1_fdppqbn,1578690260.0,"Oh my, that does really help my problem. Thank you for taking your time and dedication into those paragraphs of advice! I will try my best starting from now."
Advice,fdp37w5,t1_fdoxigm,1578618930.0,"Thank you for your advice. It does help, although I don’t think studying with groups would help because I’m a literal loner. I’m in the middle of (sorta) studying right now though! Hehe, thank you again for your advice."
Advice,fdoqx3o,t1_fdoqoni,1578610891.0,Any time! Good luck with your future decisions as well.
Advice,fdoq6ch,t1_fdoplyg,1578610380.0,"Well, coming from a person who has never, ever smoked a blunt, smoked weed, vaped, or etc like that.. except for drinking. I just feel like you shouldn’t even smoke weed with your friends, though I think I’m about to get bashed out for this. 

You don’t have to, if you feel like you’re pressured, then don’t do it. You don’t have to smoke weed just to make them accept you more as a friend."
Advice,fdopoet,t3_emheln,1578610073.0,"Remember, anxiety, the problem mainly comes from how your mind thinks and controls you. Try our best that no one is thinking about you and etc, repeatedly tell that to yourself."
Advice,fdopkca,t3_emhfe8,1578610007.0,Don’t
Advice,fdfm0hr,t1_fdfkbpu,1578364809.0,Yes that is true.. hmm. You can maybe try cleaning or doing housework chores? Try doing hobbies to get your mind off how you feel.
