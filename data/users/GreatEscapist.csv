(At work on mobile so I'll leave the sourcing and citing in the capable hands of anyone who wants to look into it.)

More importantly as forward thinking and progressive as the show has been, it also sometimes channels a very outdated-even-for-its-time type of humor. It taught me more about obsolete stereotypes and cliches than i ever would have learned out in the world and i believe some of those things absolutely stuck around beyond their relevance because of pop culture references like in the simpsons

Overwatch,fendkv7,t1_fenamda,1579282400.0,"I've played a lot of ctf since they started putting it back in the arcade last spring. There's a solid core of players who play it really well, but there are always new people turning up and sometimes entire groups don't seem to understand the momentum of the game.

I've spent a lot of time trying to teach people about it because I want the queue to stay healthy and fun for myself and others. The main point that is difficult to get across is that depending on the enemy comp or playstyle, we often don't even need 1 defender camping. Everything can be hashed out at mid and teams should be moving up and down the field more like a soccer game. **A camping team is just 1 fight lost away from losing a point. Urge your teams not to give up ground to the enemy.**

I found for myself that games and winrates improved dramatically just by aggressively playing the objective and catching the enemy off guard or turning them around to allow my team to gain ground at mid. **Watch the killfeed like a hawk. As soon as your team is at an advantage start making bold plays for the flag.** Gl! if you see a Cricket in the queue let me know you're from reddit :D"
Overwatch,fen6d14,t1_fen44wq,1579277958.0,"I wish CTF was a regular mode too. I think if the first iteration hadn't gotten so much bad press before the balance changes it maybe would be by now. But a lot of players are resistant to it and it has remained pretty niche.

But yeah, being able to play keep-away with the flag instead of capping and ending the game is brutal. Luckily it doesn't happen often - which it would in regular rotation I think :/"
Overwatch,fen53ag,t3_epx6av,1579277155.0,"So CTF limits mobility abilities in a pretty consistent way

Any mobility that offers any horizontal boost is banned and drops the flag - Genji dash, Lucio speed amp and wallride, hanzo double jump, Soldier sprint, Mccree Roll...etc

Any self knockbacks will drop the flag \*if the player moves with it\* so Ashe can't use her's, but Pharah and Junk can use theirs as long as they only hit an enemy

1 exception I can think of is that Mei's Cryofreeze drops it - I think this is more Mei can't troll her own team and keep the flag from them because other defensive abilities like Hog's heal and Orisa's fortify are fine.

Ults are a little confusing too, for example Hog can ult with it but Winston can't because that health boost would be op. I forget now if Moira can ult with it

But most importantly, **any upward mobility that only offers upward mobility is fine.** As far as I know, this is only Shimada wall climb and Pharah's flying. Doomfist's uppercut goes forward a bit and does drop it. \*I have yet to test Baptiste's big-boy jump but I think it'll drop the flag

Anyway, in conclusion, play nice, play Pharah ;)"
Overwatch,fen3rm8,t3_eq1x4m,1579276323.0,"I absolutely love it! But definitely not more than regular CTF

I think this is a fun contrast to CTF and I reallllly hope it enters the arcade rotation (especially because it incorporates the other old KOTH maps that used to be in the first CTF rotation) but I would be pretty devastated if it ever replaced it. The back and forth momentum of regular CTF is really fun to me and I think Blitz will wear a little thin like any other spammy mode does."

This is my entire problem with the change. I'm a super casual player who usually queues with 1 or 2 friends. We usually pick up at least a tank or support role, and try for one of us to have fun on dps. We swap around and sometimes fill both, other times we wanna be a dps team.

I don't mind starting a game with 4 dps because I know my friends and I will switch it up on the fly to work for the win, while still trying to get some time on the heroes we prefer. Even better when you get to win with a weird ass comp that no one would have expected.

characterarcs,fdrji4h,t3_emtqso,1578685377.0,I always upvote conversations like this. Love seeing people de-escalate
DestinyTheGame,fdrhtfx,t1_fdqu394,1578684644.0,"I hate seasons but I dont give a fuck about the politics on this sub. I just thought it was funny to see such a big string of comments deleted.

Everyone gets a little heated when theyre passionate about something. Don't let that fracture the community or get you caught up in that us vs them mentality, there's too much of it in the world and it accomplishes nothing."
chaoticgood,fdqp5jm,t1_fdqe3aa,1578671861.0,"Ive started linking half these posts to my small dnd discord group just so we can make fun of the comments

You are not alone"
facepalm,fdqjfwy,t3_empilw,1578668150.0,Fuck me i have to stop reading these stories I'm already scared enough of pregnancy when I feel slightly nauseated in the morning
DestinyTheGame,fdqfqvn,t1_fdq6xup,1578665531.0,This champ you were calmly discussing with had to delete their comments rather than admit any mistake lol
DestinyTheGame,fdqflw6,t1_fdqdh9f,1578665429.0,"Exactly. I had been excited to see where the dreaming city was going because the story and design of the place (mysteries and secrets to find!) got me invested. 

Im not at all interested in *buying a ticket* for a bit of temporary gameplay and weak story just so I have some busy work to log in for."
chaoticgood,fdo3x9r,t1_fdo3m2e,1578598442.0,Thanks for that. I've started and deleted a few replies that weigh in on the rape part more specifically but it's not a debate I need today and you reminded me *why* i kept deleting them.
chaoticgood,fdnvsu1,t3_embmgo,1578593858.0,"So today someone posted an actual chaotic good post and half the comments are complaining it's unlawful. Wat

I agree it's too extreme an act (or would be where I live* but I dont have the first-hand experience that would relate to this article)

This is why full chaos, even for ""good"" is not fully palatable for most people. Likewise about the extreme side of law."

aww,fdigjnz,t1_fdie3ok,1578442408.0,It's my mom's favourite movie. I very nearly loved it too. It's true though I almost never see any reference to it
AskReddit,fdi2zgc,t1_fdi14xt,1578434807.0,"lol your answer struck me as really sarcastic so I responded in kind, sorry

i've never heard a human use those words at another human, not as advice, not as a challenge, for nothing

I don't think ""quotes"" have to be that direct?? As Marilyn used it, a general statement, and contextually as someone whose ""good"" was desired by many, it makes sense to me. Reminding her idealizing fans that she has a flawed side too. 

But on a personal level I don't think any sane person see's the quote as anything other than a thing you tell yourself, or maybe a way to cut off people who demonstrably only want to use you."
AskReddit,fdhzclt,t1_fdhx8hw,1578432927.0,"How the fuck often do you hear that phrase? Spoken aloud? In a conversation? Idiots will always misuse stupid quotes for stupid purposes and it sounds like you're just parroting the same notion that this comment chain is trying to counter

The point we're trying to make is that most people have experienced a friend you thought was close but disappeared the second things got tough. Or people who get locked feeling misplaced loyalty towards someone who simply doesn't care as much. These situations are hard and painful and that quote can be a healthy reminder of how to pick out the people who genuinely care, and that you still deserve love even on a bad day."
AskReddit,fdhtoqw,t1_fdh30m7,1578429967.0,"The pushback against this quote has bothered me a couple times because i'm struggling to recognize which people in my life are true friends and who is more of a fairweather friend. Particularly when I'm at my ""worst"" and wanting a friend."

I really really pay attention, i love watching them. But maybe i sometimes lose track of story because im thinking about the technical side? Either way im always sneaking and reading the synopsis of things ive seen to better commit the memory

I also always want to take a couple 5 minute breaks throughout"

I really have no idea but would that attitude prevail over the mobilize-for-war attitude of the time? War made an exception for plenty of things. I don't think this point is necessarily so far fetched as to be impossible when youre discussing the actual collapse of the population."
MensLib,fdh79qv,t1_fdh6vpj,1578416910.0,Yeah. I assumed you miswrote that because it doesnt make sense. Maybe im having a brain fart but it sounds like youre suggesting there are more men than women in your scenario
MensLib,fdh0gs0,t1_fdgw54m,1578412679.0,"Not with multiple men, but keeping enough healthy young women injury/stress free to ensure healthy births could be a factor?

If there are more women than men there is still potential for maximum pregnancies, 1 man can impregnate several women."
