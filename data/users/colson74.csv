They Scooby doo gang?
Or maybe small towns folks? Right? 

I’ll leave you with this..."
peopleofwalmart,ffnq69e,t3_eu7rye,1580069256.0,"Ooh a dumb shit that believes the government is only looking out for his best interest and would never fabricate anything. 
 
Sad part is that Walmart probably made him wear that shirt because Free thinkers were cutting in on the military profits. Lmfao at peoples inability to think for themselves.

No I don’t believe everything I read on the internet.
I actually research the old fashion way. I read so go ahead a say what you gotta say so I can dismiss your comments"

space,ffnfzbk,t1_ffnesks,1580065406.0,There are also no moons in the video.
space,ffnfp3q,t3_eu69sh,1580065344.0,Why don’t we see any moons rotating around the planet? Is it the wrong season or...
space,ffmfrv7,t3_eu69sh,1580054066.0,"I have questions...

In this video the planet moves as one, but in the video I put a link to, you can see the different directions the clouds move. I read the description for the video but it just seems mind-boggling.

Why is the video I linked to the only one I can find like it? 

Can it be reproduced from earth?

This years motto...”labels are for losers”
We are all beautiful!
And there is no such thing as normal!
Take control of your feelings and emotions"

rant,ffhsg7p,t3_etk694,1579951542.0,"Labels are being abused and no one cares. Those new labels these people pull out of their ass are just to make them feel different, to separate themselves from everyone else...it’s utter bullshit!!! 

You are who you are. A beautiful creature, unique, and alive! You want people to respect you but you disrespect them by making them sound like beasts cause they can’t read your mind. 

You alone are responsible for your emotions and feelings. No can control those two things but you. Call me what you want or say what you want about me but you cannot change my opinion about myself. That power belongs to me alone."
amiugly,ffhrxqe,t3_eth7cp,1579950765.0,"What’s your number?

Really beautiful!!"
TrueOffMyChest,ffhrn4b,t1_ffhp6fq,1579950304.0,"Great point!!
Switch gears, compare the social media of today to the drugs of yesterday. My parents were always asking and accusing me of using and when I finally broke free ...HAF all day everyday until bam lost everything. 
Coping skills is one thing that kids lack today. You have to let them fuck up or they will never learn. Moderation is key in everything we do."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffhjc85,t1_ffha19w,1579937872.0,"If it were true( not saying it isn’t) I’d be upset also. But as of late there have been a few “convenient” politically incorrect moves like this happening involving hot topics. 
In my opinion, I think it is a power play, that just adds more people who my not have been paying attention to the climate issue, to pay a little more.

Again my opinion."

ExtremeCarCrashes,fffbnf0,t1_fbvipgq,1579880402.0,"Gonna day the same thing but I’ll add...that’s why you should always respect big rigs, because even though most legal teams, in my area, demonize them, it really don’t matter who is at fault if you’re dead. 

Give em a break, you have to stop a 1 to 3 ton vehicle and they have to slow and control to a stop a 5+ton behemoth."
ExtremeCarCrashes,fffaxlw,t3_ef0wep,1579879940.0,Why is he an idiot? That building clearly ran out in front of him.

And yes there are plenty other benzos that would do way better at helping someone forget a certain doctors horrific surgical procedures using no anesthesia. Any street pharmacists can tell you that.

But you win jeeze some people are so out to prove themselves."

oddlyterrifying,ffdbk33,t3_esuzdz,1579817356.0,"My opinion...I think we are arrogant to think we can kill this planet. This planet will not let us destroy it. I hear people say all the time, we should be concerned about killing Mother Earth. I’m sorry but that is fucking stupid. This planet will destroy us. I mean we should definitely take care of her but not for the arrogant reason that “WE WILL DESTROY HER”! Get over yourself. She has already begun to repair her ozone, By human intervention of course but my point is this...even without human intervention we would have died off slowly and the Earth would have repaired herself. My opinion may be unpopular, stupid, dumb, and other adjective someone will come up with but one thing it’s definitely not and that is arrogant."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffd90f0,t1_ffd0rt4,1579815779.0,"I tell you this all police officers should be consider armed and dangerous. Because they take that authority to stupid levels. Police bring violence! Just because you have a badge and a costume does not mean you can just do what the hell you want to people! There are plenty of ways to prevent a person from being a threat. Rather than inflicting pain like a sadistic asshole! Police are a disease upon this world. I’m not saying we don’t need peace keepers, I’m saying this shit has gotten out of hand."
