StudentNurse,ffzazpe,t3_evti0i,1580370253.0,"That’s so rough, I’m sorry you’re stressing. So glad you made time for self care though!

I graduated in December after two years of school. Honestly, every day I wanted to die. It was terrible. Before an exam, I spent about 22 hours a weekend studying. I had zero life during school, and saw my family probably once a month (I live an hour away from them). Basically my only “self care” was day drinking and sleeping for 17 hours a day when I had a day to myself. I truly believe it worsened my depression significantly. It was so unhealthy lol

Many of my friends were able to keep a job during school, and that was kind of their “distraction”. I was never able to balance school and work... it was either one or the other.  I worked for my first semester of nursing school and failed out with a 79.02%—having to retake the class with my one “Re-do”. 
ANYWAYS enough of my sob story. What I’m getting at is it’s SO damn important to have something (preferably healthy) to get your mind off school. You have to have SOMETHING. Otherwise it will consume your life completely and there’s a rare chance you will make it to the end.  & if you do, it will take a huge toll on your mental health. Take it from me."
SkincareAddiction,ffzadkk,t1_ffza701,1580369479.0,Thank you so much. Is there a certain product involving azelaic acid that you recommend?
SkincareAddiction,ffza6t1,t1_ffz8vw9,1580369246.0,Thank you so much!! How often do you recommend to exfoliate?
SkincareAddiction,ffz78q8,t3_ew11y1,1580366153.0,"Hi! I’m sure y’all get posts like this all the time so I hope at least someone can give me some input. I found this sub about a year ago and started somewhat of a skincare routine. I’m still learning about the “good” chemicals and what works best for my skin. 

My current routine, which works best for me, is:

AM: Cetaphil facial cleanser.  Moisturize with Cetaphil DailyAdvance Lotion (if not leaving the apartment), or Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle w/ spf (if leaving to go anywhere). (During the summer I will use SubBum SPF 50...we barely get any sun in winter here in MI)
PM: Cetaphil facial cleanser.  Stridex 2% SA on face, shoulders, & upper back. Moisturize with Cetaphil or Olay Active Hydrating (I go back and forth, experimenting currently)
Etc: I use Target’s Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% for spot treatment occasionally 

Besides my ginormous pores (which I accept are never going to be removed / are just a part of my life), I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do about the redness. I’m not sure WHY I have the redness so I don’t know how I can rid my skin of it. 
ANY input is appreciated... like I said, I’m a newbie so I’m still learning.

Thank you!"

AskMen,ffvd0ze,t1_ffvc7h5,1580261238.0,I totally agree. That’s what I mean though.. there’s that gray area where there’s a reason they don’t want you to look through their phone due to cheating etc. That makes it a tough situation
AskMen,ffv9h2v,t1_ffuw8ek,1580258853.0,"Thank you for saying this... I have snooped my boyfriends phone at the beginning of our relationship 5 years ago. I’m not proud of it. But I found things that he definitely did not want me to see, regarding him and his ex. From then on, it’s hard to believe that he’s not constantly hiding something. 
Everyone on this feed is very “if she snoops, you can’t trust her at all. Break up with her. End it. “ But what about the people who looked through their partners phone, and found out they were cheating? Should they be blamed for “finding something they didn’t want to see”?

Edit: not condoning this behavior. Just offering another viewpoint"

orchids,fevy5an,t3_eqqtz4,1579403022.0,"My boyfriend got me this Phalaenopsis orchid from a grocery store probably two months ago. It was already in bloom and beautiful. Eventually the blooms fell. I followed the care on the sheet that came with the orchid. 
I knew nothing about orchids but discovered that they will re-bloom if given proper care. I’ve been trying to look for info online to determine what’s going on with mine, but I haven’t been successful. I did trim down the main stem that had the flowering(the stem on the right) after they dropped and were clearly no longer alive. 
I can’t determine what’s going on with the tan hard roots on top of the soil. And the other spikes coming up... they have some green in them so that looks like good news?
Please help. Any advice is appreciated!!"
