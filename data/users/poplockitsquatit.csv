learnart,ff3vixa,t3_erhjsk,1579549768.0,"This is so beautiful! I would recommend making a copy, like with a printer, and try inking that to see how you would like it. That way you can also practice with a couple different pen types and not risk making mistakes on your original piece ☀️"
worldbuilding,fezhynd,t1_fezht8w,1579457552.0,"It shows, your use of light and texture is fantastic, you got those visuals down 👌🌟"

painting,fezewta,t3_eqz12w,1579456609.0,"I really like it, sometimes is really cathartic to simply create abstraction. I enjoy the colors and the almost camo layers in the corners. 🌟 did you have anything you specifically wanted to achieve with this piece?"
Advice,feyv1we,t1_fenlsbw,1579450881.0,I was thinking for the “tough client” or “conflict resolution one”
Advice,feyuwym,t1_fenmhv2,1579450831.0,"Thank you for the well thought out advice 🌟 honestly thats a great idea, first time I practiced more speaking out loud with my mom and boyfriend giving me interview questions or just in my car I’d think of questions and talk as if I was answering them to get more comfortable, my first two interviews went great and I think its for that reason. This third one I was more pen and paper about my responses and as a result I got really tripped up and uncomfortable mentally."
Advice,fenlo17,t1_fenjsao,1579287343.0,"Thats fair, honestly I’ve worked in a restaurant since I was 13. Ive only interviewed once before this and it was really casual. I was set up for this company by an agency and they didn’t help me be prepared imo. Would you recommend a tight script for the future?"
Advice,fenlbkr,t1_fenk4dt,1579287132.0,"It seemed pretty casual in HR but the position overall not so much, luxury and money were emphasized. There’s apparently 4 more interviews that would come after this, I think I’d rather not get further just to not get it for some other reason."
Advice,fenjrwn,t1_fenjb26,1579286199.0,"Yeah I think I did a fantastic job otherwise, there were two people who interviewed me and this was the second. I’ve told that story on other interviews too and they’ve been impressed, it just slipped out because I got too comfortable."
Advice,femwlr9,t1_fems5eg,1579271515.0,"Yeah both my parents are either city or federal employees and they have a good net. I was told by an employment agency that the corporate job has good benefits too, but they might just want their commission 🤦‍♀️ as for retirement plan you raise a really good point.."
