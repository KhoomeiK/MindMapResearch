There's and old poem about the three unifiers of Japan. In it, Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu are sitting around a birdcage, when a servant asks them: ""What will you do if the bird doesn't sing?"" 

Nobunaga says: **""kill it""**. 

Hideyoshi says: ""*Make it want to sing*"".

Ieyasu simply says: ""Wait""."

AskReddit,fdjzs5n,t3_elscjk,1578492441.0,"Ok, I should preface this by saying that I'm not a lawyer, but while i school I spent some time doing an internship at a law firm, and I asked one of the lawyers. I'll try to recreate his answer as well as I can remember, but it was something along these lines:

See, the thing is lawyers rarely get a client that comes up to you and says **""I did it""**, and unless they say that, then the principle of innocent until proven guilty *must hold*.  It is one of the foundantions of our society for a reason. As a lawyer, you'll just do your job and trust that the judge and jury will decide correctly. Besides, how would you cope morally with building a sloppy defence on purpose, get him convinted, and then find out he was actually innocent? You are just as likely to be mistaken as the jury is, if not even more so. 

And what if he admits to the crime right of the bat? Well, again, you'll do your job. The truth is rarely black and white. They may have murdered someone, but *why*? Should the wife who after years of violent abuse stabbed her husband, get the same sentence as the contract killer? What about someone who was arguing with a friend, pushed him (stupid thing to do, but with no inherent murderous intention) only to see him slip, hit the back of the head hard and die? Again, is this the same as cartel hitman?

The defense's job is merely to explain how things went, or at the very least how they think they went. There's nothing amoral or wrong in that. Quite the contrary, it's a necessary and noble job"
