Seriously, though, I get professionalism, but it would probably would be cool with everyone if she went up on to those steps at the side or something. Also, maybe pick someone who outweighs the kangaroo to hold it back."

gifs,feewuzk,t3_eor13o,1579042953.0,I love this because William doesn’t seem confident doing this and obviously took time to learn this specifically for this man. That’s an excellent quality for a leader to have. It’s the little personal courtesies that really make a difference.

insanepeoplefacebook,febur29,t3_eob2sr,1578962963.0,"Siiiiiigh
I’ve chosen to be a stay at home mom, and ladies like this make me grind my teeth. The fact is this is a *choice* I made, not something I was forced to do. After my kids are in school I fully plan on jumping back into college and a chosen profession, because that is also a fulfilling choice I can make. I recognize that if the long line of women I come from had been allowed the same opportunities, the world would certainly be a more advanced place."

There was nothing I or anyone else could have done to prevent it, but I still feel guilty and find ways to blame myself sometimes, because I’m a mom. If there had been something I could have done and I actively refused to do it, I cannot even put into words to amount of guilt and shame I would carry. I don’t know if the full risks of a brain bleed just haven’t sunk in for them yet or what, but I just want to go full mama bear on these people on behalf of that child."
