AskReddit,few294k,t1_fevac3e,1579404471.0,Try eating all of your calories in a 6-8 hour window and then not eating at all the other 16-18 hours.  The pounds will roll off!  I eat for 5 hours and fast for 19 each day and have lost 30 lbs in the past year.  I use an app called zero calories fasting tracker.  You put in when you're done eating and then when you break the fast.  It keeps track of your daily progress.  Very helpful and makes you try to beat your previous record.
AskReddit,few1mcj,t1_fevpfrj,1579404194.0,I eliminated wheat and sugar from my diet for several weeks and found my hunger levels and cravings went down to nothing.  Now i do eat a bit of pasta or a heel of crusty bread now and then as well as a piece of chocolate but still can easily go from after dinner till 1 pm the next day without eating (save for a 10:30 am banana) and without feeling hungry.
AskReddit,few0q62,t3_eqjamz,1579403820.0,"I lost 50 lbs in the past three years and 30 lbs in the past 15 months by going MOSTLY vegan and wheat free and sugar free and eating in a five hour window each day.  Now, after I'm done with dinner I still have a couple to several beers most nights but I don't eat anything solid till the next afternoon.  The massive amounts of veggies, beans, grains ( quinoia, farro, barley), and fruits I eat fill me up so I can last 19 hours between solid meals. I make sure to have dark green leafy veggies, beets, cruciferous veggies, legumes, nuts (from the shell), olives, celery, and a hard boiled egg every day.  I cook meat for my family and regularly have a bite or two to get the excellent bioavailable protein and vitamins I need.   Once a week or so I will have some sushi or a small piece of fish, I do have a piece of fruit (usually a banana) at about 10:30 am if I feel lightheaded or rumbly int the tumbly.   I do a 20-30 minute body weight living room workout or work out with weights and a heavy bag every day.  You just have to make it part of your routine and understand that there are certain things that aren't healthy for you to eat and you just can't do it anymore.   Honestly, cooking fresh veggies and grains and adding spices and peppers and herbs tastes so fucking good that there's nothing that I miss from when I was eating unhealthy.  I do have a piece of chocolate now and then but I try to make that a rare event.  After stopping sugar and wheat for a while the cravings go away and my hunger levels are WAY down.  If anyone's interested in the workouts I formulated let me know.   I am in my late 50s and in almost the best shape of my life.  My blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol went way down in the past year."
