changemyview,fdgv1g0,t3_el3zgv,1578409028.0,"I recently bought a new mattress. I didn't want to spend the $500, but my mom convinced me by pointing out that my bed was 10 years old and sagging. ""But it's still comfortable"" I said ""I dont notice the sag"" but then she said something that changed my mind on the matter:

""A mattress lasts 10 years and costs $500. That's only $50 per year. How much time do you spend in bed?"" I hadn't realized how important and how cheap beds actually were.

I may be the best person here to try and change your mind because I held this exact same view for the majority of my life. I would lift my mattress up and lean it against the wall everyday for the extra floor space. I also hate taking apart furniture too big to move. Eventually I ended up buying two of [these](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Foldable-Platform-Under-Bed-Storage/dp/B073WR319C?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-ffab-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B073WR319C) and they have been great purchases I highly recommend. The main reason I bought them was because I had met someone special and I didn't want to bring them to my room and have them see clutter, and I didn't want someone I cared about to sleep uncomfortably because they are likely not used to sleeping on the floor like me. But here are some benefits you may be overlooking.

\- The air is cleaner / less dusty. I know this was the first thing you mentioned but the point is one of the most valid reasons to get a frame. You will notice yourself waking up with a stuffy nose less often. Air is constantly moving, and even though you cannot see the dust it is there. The air below our knees is much less pure. You don't need to be breathing that for 8 hours every day.

\- Warm air from your heater will quickly rise away from the floor

\- There is a better draft at the higher level, you can feel the breeze from an open window

\- When you fart, you don't have to bathe in it.

\- You bed now doubles as a chair

\- You can easily move from that sitting position to standing. Getting out of bed always begins with getting into a sitting position. When the bed is raised, that position is 90% the way to getting up. But when the bed is on the floor, that position is maybe 20% of the way there and it is much easier to lie back down than it is to stand up. The additional motivation to wake up, however small it may be, really matters when it is compounded to the first thing you experience every day of your life for years and years.

\- You can comfortably fall into bed without worry of damaging it

\- The storage space under the bed helps declutter your room

\- Your bed is now a surface you can use to lay out things and organize your life (I dump my clean clothes onto my bed when I begin folding)

\- You room will look better, like an adult lives there

\- You will feel more like an adult

\- Making your bed in the morning will be much easier

I can probably think of more reasons, but I must add the there is only one valid reason NOT to have a bed frame. And that is when you have an old dog who wants to sleep in bed with you but cannot make the jump anymore. Then its time to put the frame away for the sake of the old pupper."
