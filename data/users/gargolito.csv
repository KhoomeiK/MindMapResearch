If you are denied rights that everyone is guaranteed in our society just because the intolerant do not like who you are through no fault of your own and without you having actively done anything to them, it will cause you stress. Stress is an extremely heavy burden on your health with lasting effects from which many people cannot easily recover.  It may not be physical violence, but I posit that it is far more damaging and affects more people than physical violence.

I'm obsessed with the power that language can be used and is being used in the most sophisticated psy-op attack in history, it drives me insane. Your assessment, if it can be called that, is also an effect of that attack: to fear your own shadow.

Before you go around calling people ignorant for posting a silly video that does not link directly to its source and would require someone to have the initiative to go find its source, and then go down the rabbit hole that may end up in yet another psychological victim of the far-right, is beyond asinine.

It's reasoning like yours that's actually dangerous to the rest of us on the left. Outrage is exactly what the misinformation peddlers want.
