I don’t disagree...about the original insulin.

The expensive ones aren’t even really insulin, and that (as well as the fact that they are time release/self regulating/etc is where the cost came from. Yes original insulin is made very cheaply (honestly most of the $30-60 is because of fda testing costs) but the new fancy stuff...well...again, we’re talking Honda vs ferrari...they both have 4 wheels and an engine (what the drugs ultimately do) but ultimately everything is different"

trashy,fgbe5an,t1_fgbd8ww,1580661207.0,"...I’m not disagreeing with you? The only thing I was talking about was where you said giving the deer meat to the homeless and how if it’s being done by the city (excluding hunters) then I disagree with that, but would have to see the data. I’m not disagreeing with culling at all, I’m a big advocate of it (I’m also a scientist and actually know some people that have done studies on culling herds/what happens if you don’t). Again, my only hesitance was the idea of using them to feed the homeless. It’s a good idea, but if doing that prevents hunters (that need it for food too) from getting food, then I disagree with the idea of some city/corporation giving the meat to homeless. The hesitance is not with the culling, only if they prevent hunters from hunting so the city can cull and use all the meat for the homeless

trashy,fgaxmo4,t1_fgawckb,1580656433.0,"My only problem with that, although being a good idea, is it sounds like it’s then the city/corporation going to cull the herd. Since only a certain number of kills are allowed each year, that could mean only x go to individuals (rather than xxx) and (admittedly not the case everywhere) those individuals might be hunting out of necessity. I’m not saying I’m against it, but just that I’d like to see the details. If it’s something along the lines of “want to hunt but have leftovers/don’t eat deer (I know a few hunters that don’t eat the meat, but won’t go hunting until they know people that will take it so there’s no waste) then go ahead and drop the body off here” but if it’s just “lol we kill all them so no one else can” then idk how much I support that. Yes the argument could be made that the homeless need things more than someone that has the ability to hunt, but again, what if we’re talking poor rural America?

Sorry to hear that about your grandmother, and especially with it being polio. Honestly though, the problem is...we did/do too good of a job/vaccines work too well (aside from ethical reasons of making a vaccine that is only 90% effective on purpose). People used to (still do in 3rd world countries) line up for vaccines the way people line up for iPhones back then because there were no vaccines, it was just people against the disease, and in that war, as all wars, lots of people died.  Now though, since vaccines are common place and every major disease (like polio) is either no problem at all (eradicated) or is only a problem in third world countries (where it’s soo far removed from the places that antivaxxers exist), people that never experienced those horrible diseases first/second hand (like, they were fine but their brother wasn’t) don’t believe vaccines do anything and it’s not necessary...that or they’re the extreme nutjobs that believe “used to be a doctor but isn’t anymore” Andrew Wakefield when he claimed vaccines cause autism and told them that of course pharma will lie because they want to protect their profits 

The simple answer to that (every time I’ve said this to someone, I swear, I could literally smell their brain frying from trying to think it through) is:

“Every scientist dreams of being the guy that made the biggest discovery. Let’s pretend there really are corporate hitmen and whatnot. Do you really think a scientist (who is smart enough to be a scientist, would also know how to set computers/dead man switches up) wouldn’t have a way/motivation to find proof vaccines cause autism in today’s world? The argument of them not having a job anymore doesn’t work. Andrew Wakefield was a doctor and lost his license, now you guys give him money to hear him give the same seminar he’s given for the last 20 years. Do you really think a blackballed scientist that proved vaccines=autism wouldn’t make any money? Do you really believe a scientist wouldn’t have a computer set up (if he was on to something) that would email all his data to all the news agencies if he fails to enter a code every day (in case he was magically killed by imaginary corporate hitmen)?... ...ok I’m done you can speak now... ...you can still speak right?...shit I think that broke them”"

As for insulin-
1-unless there’s something that’s not on my registry, we don’t have any insulin. The last time we did was 2007 (2008?) with Exubra
2-until I have more details I’m not going to empathize with your friend about his insulin. The whole point of the insulin cost claim, is that insulin was $25 but now is $500 (implying the same insulin and that it increased that much). It did not. The $25 insulin still exists (the original insulin) and can be bought without insurance for $30-60 depending on the state/store (I know because I bought insulin at the cvs down the road without my card for $37 a month ago to prove a point). The $500 insulin (or whatever it’s going for) is self regulating/time release/“fancy” insulin that cost billions to research and years to get through trials. The insulin cost claim is the equivalent of putting a Honda next to a ferrari, being outraged the ferrari costs so much, and saying “they both have an engine and 4 wheels, they should be the same price”...is $500 still too much? Yea sure I’ll agree to that, but just like if you want a ferrari over a Honda you have to pay for it, same with insulin/everything else. If the $500 option were the only one then I’d be outraged too and I’d be fighting as well. But, there’s an option available, that’s cheap, and does its job (admittedly not as well, but it still keeps you alive). You don’t automatically deserve to have the best of anything just because, as long as there is something (if it’s a need) and it’s affordable and works, that’s all you’re guaranteed...and there’s just that...an affordable insulin, that does its job. 

My claim about the insulin argument was never that $500 is justified...but rather the argument that’s shown everywhere is a bad faith argument 

Bad faith-defined-intent to deceive

By saying “insulin was $25, now it’s $500”...that is bad faith, at it implies it’s talking about the same insulin, rather than giving all the information

Now-do I sympathize with your friend (I think I’m confusing sympathy and empathy) for the fact that the fancy insulin is expensive, and maybe his doctor was bought and won’t allow the cheap/original to be used? Yes absolutely. But if there are no limitations, and the only reason he doesn’t want the cheap stuff is because it’s more work (all the finger pricking/testing rather than just 1 shot at the beginning of the day and it manages itself) then to me, honestly, that’s not a good reason in my book. My boss makes 3 times what I make (and I (not trying to brag, just trying to get a point across) make stupid money...I can’t spend it fast enough) and he still buys the cheap insulin and tests his blood all day (I don’t know why he prefers it, just that he does, and he’s my boss so I’m not going to push a personal matter farther)

Now-shitty stuff-if there’s any genuine shitty things going on, I honestly wouldn’t know, because it’s not my job to know, I don’t know what Albert bourla and Lidia fonseca and the board are doing and I couldn’t find out if I tried.

Lastly-and I was going to let this go, but I can’t...your sarcastic statement about my robots and toys...forget everything else for a second. A company that is researching drugs/vaccines that people are going to use, and are literally going to save lives...do you want that company to be using a $500 tool that was made 3 years ago and just tells us “uhh, nah looks good brah” or would you prefer that company make the investment in something that can tell us “the results indicate a complete binding to the antigens of serotypes pn9n pn18c and pn23f with only a partial binding to pn7v and pn4c with no binding on pn1n” (good for the first 3, medium for the second 2, and awful/nothing for the last 1)...if you go out for sushi, would you rather the chef serve you the raw fish that has been kept at -80c for days, and cleaned/frozen the minute it was caught, and went from ocean to plate within 1 week? Or serve you the raw fish that was sitting at the back of a lukewarm fridge that was caught a month ago, and still hasn’t been cleaned yet?"
trashy,fg5d47q,t1_fg5cgut,1580524314.0,"So the things I agreed with originally (like saying I support everyone having at least a minimum of coverage for healthcare (don’t have to worry about shit like a broken leg, but if they want something done for something non emergency (like plastic surgery) they have to pay for it) or making at least the amount to no go into debt just for living is all it is (in addition to the utilities and production stuff you mentioned)? So even with socialism, you still get paid based on your contribution to society? It’s not “everyone gets x regardless”? It’s literally just “being dead won’t be cheaper than being alive anymore, but if you want to be able to x you have to do something that contributes enough to warrant it?

I literally had someone tell me on here though that socialism is the best answer because it “gives everyone the same position/advantages/etc in life regardless of what they do for work, and that with that people that dont do (big job here) can still have the life of someone that do (big job here”...that and the similar statements is why I disagreed with it, because my first thought was -that’s not fair, why should someone that put no effort in get the same rewards as someone that did put the effort in and my second was -if that’s how it would work, then there would be no incentive to put the effort in, so why would anyone put effort in if there’s no greater reward compared to literally doing nothing?
