That's a little more than '0' *out of pocket* (a term not even remotely applicable to taxation).

> In 2016 the U.S. spent 18% of its GDP on healthcare, whereas the next highest country (Switzerland) devoted 12% of its GDP to healthcare. The average amount spent on healthcare per person in comparable countries ($5,198) is half that of the U.S. ($10,348).

Oh well look at that, the cost of healthcare is just plain higher when the system is for profit. Meaning you're all paying a chunk of half the amount of money in countries with socialised medicine. Compared to twice the amount, and not evenly distributed across the population (meaning that people in good health don't take some of the burden).

> In 2000, the U.S. had about 46% fewer physician consultations per capita than similarly wealthy countries, and the gap has remained generally consistent over time.
