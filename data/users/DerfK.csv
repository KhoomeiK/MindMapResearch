One of the things that ""tort reform"" advocates tout is how much cheaper healthcare will be once the doctors don't have to pay so much for their malpractice insurance. [Nope.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/06/01/the-cost-conundrum) Texas passed pretty hardcore malpractice reform and the docs took their malpractice insurance savings and bought fancy new equipment to do more tests with, because after a few years of ""doing these tests to make sure we don't get sued"" they realized that they could be ""doing these tests because everytime we do them the machine makes a ka-ching sound""."

HealthInsurance,ffw2n6l,t1_ffw05bt,1580281685.0,"The way COBRA is usually gamed is that you plan to spend one month uninsured and have insurance lined up starting the month after (keep in mind most states have a deadline of enrolling in the exchange by the 15th to get insurance starting the next month).

In your case though you can skip 2 months: at the end of February you should either have a job or get an exchange plan that will start April 1.  Then, if you need insurance during February or March, at that time you submit your COBRA paperwork and pay for both February and March and retroactively re-activate your company insurance.

This works because you have 60 days after losing coverage or getting your COBRA notice to retroactively get COBRA, and 60 days after losing coverage to start a new exchange plan going forward.  February is only 29 days so it's exactly 60 days to April 1 :)  Otherwise, for instance if you lost the insurance on March 31st, and tried to skip 2 months you could end up in the hospital on May 31 with insurance starting tomorrow and the deadline for applying to COBRA yesterday.

You also need to watch out for probation periods at new jobs, if you don't get insurance until you've worked for X months you'll be stuck without if you didn't have an alternate plan in place. Also, the federal penalty for being uninsured is gone but some states have created their own penalties, so you may need to check how long you can be uninsured in your state before you try to skip two months."

2. You pay the insurance administrator the premium for the insurance, and the hospital whatever the copay/deductible etc is for the services.  Since it's the beginning of the year, the deductible probably reset so you will need to pay that too if the ER charges that much.
3. Hard to say.  ER visits are pretty inflated, and you might be able to negotiate a cash pay discount.
4. Correct, once you have your new company's insurance starting in February you would cancel the COBRA coverage.  You would only need to pay the premium for January.

To figure out the cost of COBRA premiums you will need to know the true premium (most companies pay some portion of your insurance policy, often 50%, which is why people are amazed how expensive COBRA is).  COBRA adds a 2% ""service charge"" on top of the true premium cost for managing your enrollment outside of the company.  As for the cost of the ER trip with insurance, you'll need to look at your plan information and figure out if your deductible resets in January (most but not all do) and if so, how much it reset to this year."
HealthInsurance,felmt7f,t3_ept3pa,1579225932.0,"Most insurance companies will reset your deductible if they ever figure out that you did not actually pay the $2000.  The doctor's scheme is basically exactly the same as with the drug copay assistance programs, where the drug manufacturer fronts thousands of dollars to pay off your deductible on their expensive drugs because once that's done they expect to get thousands more direct from the insurance.

That said, I think if the doctor bills the insurance for services he did not perform, that would be fraud, even if the doctor did not bill you and receive any money.  The doctor may be able to put together a case that whatever he did do was worth $2000, especially since he's not in network and not beholden to the insurance company's contracted rates.

Aside from that, what happens after you meet this out-of-network deductible? Is the doctor going to be similarly charitable if your insurance only pays 50% of everything else out of network?"

HealthInsurance,fekbftm,t1_fejwviy,1579196546.0,"Do you have the CPT codes for the labs (5 digits, for labs almost always starting with ""8"") or just LabCorp's 6-digit codes for the labs?  The insurance company can't help you without the CPT codes since those are what are actually sent to them for billing.

If you have the 6 digit codes from LabCorp, you can look them up on their website: https://www.labcorp.com/test-menu/search to get the CPT code.  For instance, a [028142 CBC without differential](https://www.labcorp.com/tests/028142/complete-blood-count-cbc-without-differential) says CPT:85027. Some tests may have multiple codes, all of them will be billed together so you will need to total them up.  Tests that say ""reflex"" may have additional testing done in certain conditions, you'll need to search for the additional tests separately.

Not all of the tests will show up in LabCorp's website, you should be able to call them and ask which CPT codes are in tests that don't (these are often custom order codes that doctors have made that might have a dozen or so tests included in them so be ready to write them all down)."

Unless, of course, it's true that this guy had testified against the rapist previously.  Why didn't it come up during the trial?
