AskReddit,fexawbi,t1_fewgzyk,1579427885.0,"My take on this topic.  

- Was the study properly controlled to give accurate results?
 Personally  i don't  subscribe to many homeopathic treatments, other than a well trained chiropractor. However they do exist and many have for 1000's of years. If you look back on some ancient medicine ( pre roman ), you hear of incredibly advanced procedures taking place with oddly high success rates. Eg. The Mayan, egyptian, and indian practices all show scientific approaches, and could successfully open up a skull and close it. 
 However slim it is i like to look at it is, if there is a chance they knew something we didn't perhaps we are missing something. If we dont properly study it how will ever know if we are? 

 Do i think people should still practice these old as forms of medicine no i do not, but for science not fully study them is a different story. Humans are not stupid and wouldn't pass down traditions for 1000s of years if they were completly useless, and you never know maybe will will unlock our chakras one day."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fdjrzxr,t1_fdhyqcr,1578485342.0,"I think i base a large portion of my diet off of this. I basically stirfry every thing.

Start with a base grain i use rice or quinoa, i usually cook 3 lbs at a time and store it. Day old rice fries up better.  

Then you need your veggies - green peppers, onions , garlic go in just about everything. I will add other vegetable depending on the meal. Bean sprouts, cilantro, spinach, tomatoes etc...

Next learn to cook up your protein. Depending on what i am going for i sautee my onions and garlic first then remove and brown my protein bornally chicken for me but just about any meat or proteain goes well with it. Once my protein is cooked i add in veggies onion and any liquid flavorings i will be adding. And let them cook together for a few minutes adding an egg or two usually. 

Now once all the liquids and stuff have evaporated out of my hot pan and the eggs are cooked i throw in a bit of vinegar usually apple cider vinegar to deglaze throw in the rice or quinoa cook for another few minutes take off and serve. 

Seasonings i use for the most part are fajita seasonings, teriyaki / other eastern variants, and the basic curry spices.  If you want for fajitas do this and make the rice on the side serve with tortillas. Its a simple logic i ise to eat healthy cheap with a bit of variety all taking only about 20 minutes a night to prepare. Plus it always taste better the next day"

Whether this guy needs a place to stay we offer safe clean homes it cant be forced because people will run. The only thing that should be forced is time with a family member or friend deemed safe therapy and search for a job. 
 If they have a respectable place to stay, we offer government support programs to give them a job, free access to healthcare, and workout facilities.

Showerthoughts,fcxwpvp,t1_fcxq87l,1578071589.0,"I say it took 20 years because thats what it i am told.

The pyramids are said to be made around 4500 years ago.

All of the ancient civilizations with writing before the egyptians state that their was an ancient civilization more advanced. They also give up incredibly accurate astronomical knowledge. I am talking about knowledge of procession all of the known planets. They even stated there was a 10th planet in a highly elliptical orbit that causes shifts in  the orbits of other planets. Which just so happens to match up with recent theories of a tenth planet causing these changes.y 

The time you are refferring to between the most ancient civilizations we know of with writings and egypt is only about 1500 years. These ancient civilizations speak times much earlier prediluvian. The deluge is said to have taken place 12,500 years ago right around the time of the younger dryas impact which would have changed the earth drastically. Over 90% of the large animal species died in this time period very siddenly.
 I am not trying to focus this on the pyramids. I am focusing on the fact there are hundreds of structures across the world that shouldnt be there. It is not feasible for non metal age civilizations to construct these monuments e.g. gobekli tepi. Along with the many underwater sites exhibiting these styles of buildings. The thing is these underwater sites have been underwater for 10,000+ years the yanaguni monument in japan is one of the most notable but there are many more. 

Now for the last part. The holes you are referring to. Could you clarify on them a little bit more?
The problem with a lot of modern explanations is that they are made from the basis of; we found some old stones, we also found some pottery. You can date the pottery not the stones ( as easily ). So the pottery is this old then these are the people that built it. This guy was in charge so he ordered it to be built. Even the romans in their construction project with detailed writings don't talk about how they constructed the base of heliopolis or made the pillars. They do however go into detail about every other aspect of the building. The problem with this method is that it only shows the most recent people to inhabit it. 
Lastly i would like to ask what makes you sure in your opinions? You have denied many things i say without evidence to back them up. I am not trying to say we were flying around in spaceships or we had death rays. All i am trying to get acrossed is we are missing something in the timeline of human progression. Too many finds are disregarded because they can't be placed in the modern canon of history. This style of teaching only makes figuring out what really happened this much harder. You yourself even questioned the 20 year number given by google because it simply doesn't make sense.

Showerthoughts,fcxnd4o,t1_fcxbr33,1578067054.0,You gave me 2 links neither describe much at all. The first one gives an explanation of how they could have dragged stones across sand nothing else. Let alone how they qaurried and effectively moved 2.3 million stones across the desert in 20 years. Let alone how they stacked them so precisely or how they moved 100 ton slab of granite to place above the kings chamber. If the first link is to be believed wouldnt it make mire sense to lay a nice level foundationed road from the qaurry to the pyramid? At the rate they could perfectly cut shape and lift these blocks it would have taken no time at all.

The one i grabbed was only a 38.5 hour check but after taking a look i did.  ( total deduct - 401k ) ÷ gross pay = .2818. I'm no accountant but as an american making 50-60k a year thats what i pay.

So they are comparing all of these dna samples from south america they all share many common nucleotides. Then all of a sudden they don't match up with the prior data sets. Showing between 2-4% deviation so up to 4% of this specimens dna does not line up with all of its ancestors. They then started mapping the rest of the world and realized that 4% devaition happens to fit perfectly with this group acrossed the world. 4% might not seem like a lot but it doesnt take many generations for the dna to become diluted down to that percentile."

Idk exacts on dates and everything else i amnot a scientist. but test a skeleton from 22,000 years ago shows one set of dna. Test a skeleton from 20,000 years ago and it just so happens half of the dna matches the guy we found and tested in africa from 20,000 years ago. That is the where they draw there conclusions. 

They have found striations on ceilings and floors of megaliths, that if you were to put it next to another site found across the world match up so well even with measurements down to the 1/1000th of an inch they match.

I will entertain any explanations you give to me. However i have read multiple explanations to megalithic sites on how they built them. The problem is when they get field tested things dont match up or they knly explain half of of the story. 
Because it makes perfect sense that a group of egyptians qaurried, moved, and placed a 2 ton rock every 4 minutes for 20 years placed within 1000th of an inch to where it needed to be."
