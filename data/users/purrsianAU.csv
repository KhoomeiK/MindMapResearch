Eyebleach,ffhcu4t,t1_fffpgn3,1579930195.0,Will do! Dr Kevin tried to greet my cat last time I was in the waiting room but my cat was not even aware as he had his face shoved under the towel in his crate. Poor Dr Kevin just wanted to help out!
cfs,ffetj1j,t1_ffcz0or,1579864830.0,"I wouldn’t say everybody. Mine is not stress induced and I know a lot of people who also would say the same about their ME. Emotional stress is a factor, but it is with every single disease, but no one considers those conditions to actually be stress induced. There are also many other influencing factors that exacerbate ME like stress does (poor diet or anything that causes inflammation for example) but no one says they got ME because they don’t eat well.

It sounds like OP is looking for people who have emotional stress as an actual primary inducing factor as opposed to other things like viral infection or continued overexertion."
Eyebleach,ffesqse,t3_et7i7v,1579863755.0,"My vet has two resident cats that do this. They also have two frames up in the waiting area, one for the nurses and one for the vets, with a grid of individual staff photos with their names. The last photos on them are of the tortie nurse (I forgot her name) and Dr Kevin the ginger tabby. So cute!"
dataisbeautiful,ffepkmb,t1_ffemgvg,1579859051.0,"A lot of common chronic health conditions like heart problems predispose people to more serious complications or death from infections. It’s not just elderly or people you’d think of as being in poor health. My dad had a heart valve replacement years ago, is 68 and rides his bike for about 3 hours several times a week (ie he’s very fit despite his heart condition, although less than prior to it). You wouldn’t look at him and think he’s unwell, but he has been hospitalised several times due to complications from influenza. 

I don’t think the conditions of those who have died has been released, but think cardiovascular, pulmonary and immune conditions in particular, plus the elderly."

NatureIsFuckingLit,ffasgvx,t1_ff9d2yx,1579743440.0,"While that makes sense for extra protection, look at how much extra the train was wobbling - it probably didn’t feel very safe in that moment. Also panic can make us forget logic and follow the herd."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ff82899,t1_ff6peh2,1579664067.0,"It looks more like she doesn’t want to put weight on her front left foot than her hips. Have you checked her nails and in between her paw pads? If nails aren’t clipped regularly they can grow into the foot and cause pain. They can also tear a nail out a bit and it causes infection - my mum’s dog had a nail totally removed because he kept injuring it and getting it infected. Also things can get stuck right up in between the paw pads. 

Given her age, it could be arthritis, but there are treatments that can help them with pain and function. We use a supplement called Sasha’s blend for our dogs as they age and it really helps. Warmth often helps arthritic pain, so if that’s the diagnosis, make sure she has a nice cozy spot to sleep and avoid letting her get too cold in air con or actual cold weather. 

Hope you get good news at the vet and it’s something easy to treat!"
tifu,ff7tfc4,t1_ff7ih3m,1579657928.0,"OP please listen to this. If you have your own bathroom and you’re concerned with saving water, just don’t flush if you only pee - this is what people on rank water do during drought (although you will need to clean the bowl more often). If you don’t have your own bathroom, PLEASE don’t piss in a sink that others use. That’s not cool. People brush their teeth and wash their hands there. But DEFINITELY don’t pee in the kitchen sink! Your parents wash the food that you eat in that sink. They wash your dishes.

Also any future girl is going to HATE you doing that. If you ever want to live peacefully with a significant other in the future, you’re gonna have to stop peeing in sinks. 

I’m not judging you as you probably just haven’t realised all the reasons you shouldn’t piss in the sink, but I hope this has giving you a few reasons to stop. Please consider what the other people using those sinks would want."
cfs,ff5c84t,t3_erpnbg,1579586965.0,"Yea writing is hard than typing for me. It’s been years since I consistently wrote substantial amounts, but I make many more mistakes in more recent years. Not generally spelling mistakes, just the wrong letter comes out, but I notice immediately. Or a double n or m turns into something...not lettery lol. The wrong letter is usually something later in the word or in the next word I’m thinking about, so I’m sure it’s just my brain not being fully functional.

It sucks we can’t do more. Wishing him more good days then bad days, tell him the internet wants to cuddle him!"
tifu,fel91l2,t3_ephvah,1579216704.0,"Tip for the future: put a towel down wherever she is doing to sit or lie down. You could also try a different product, especially since you probably despise the smell of that one now. I use zheng gu shui, which you can buy from acupuncturists (or probably online somewhere). It’s like zen spray but doesn’t burn quite as much yet I feel it goes a bit deeper and helps pain more. Both products are linaments, so they absorb immediately into the skin and don’t rub off onto your bedding."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feixe17,t3_epc8kh,1579149846.0,I love his colouring! And those fluffy ears! I want to cuddle him and ruffle his lovely soft fur. Also want to cuddle his sister because she is a cutie. I wish I could cuddle ALL the dogs!
cfs,fed9szk,t3_eoi1ej,1579005001.0,"I do Taichi and qigong. They are gentle and aim to move qi and blood which is something we really need. What works for you will really depend on your stage of illness though.

When I was worse but wanting to increase my activity, I would simply do isometric contractions of various body parts while in bed, basically squeeze a muscle group without moving your body then relax. Sometimes I’d hold it for a bit, sometimes I’d just contract and relax and repeat to help pump blood. I’d also flex/extend joints or rotate them around in circles just to get blood moving, all while lying in bed. 

Even now, I do a warm up in the mornings where I do 10-15 rotations of each major joint - fingers (not rotating, just flex/extend), wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, chest (imagine pushing your chest out then make a circle bringing it back in then out again while trying to keep hips and head relatively still), hips (try to only move hips while keeping rest of body still for best effect), knees, ankles and finally toes (just flex/extend like fingers). I like this because it gets blood flowing throughout my body but I can do much of it sitting in bed if needed. I particularly like the chest and hips parts because I feel like it must help blood flow to all of your organs. 

The other thing I do is try to increase exercise in tiny ways during daily activity. A few shallow squats while I brush my teeth, working on correct posture at literally any time I remember it when I’m up (helps your core and postural muscles, also helps your lungs if you aren’t slouching as often), stretches while I watch tv instead of just sitting there. 

You don’t need to necessarily do “exercise”, you just need to find ways to move more and you’ll slowly work your way to being able to do more. Slowly is the key!"

Because if so, that’s a terrible argument - you should keep your cat indoors and have supervised/leashed/caged outdoor time. That way, no dead wildlife and happy kitty who hasn’t had their toes amputated for no reason. 

Indoor cats live longer and can live happy, exciting lives, just like indoor dogs. We don’t let dogs roam, so the whole “but cats need their freedom” is silly if it doesn’t also apply to dogs."

Awwducational,fe0b95l,t1_fe092fn,1578808493.0,"That’s why it’s so wrong that it’s actually legal still. As an Australian, I’d never heard of it till the internet because here it’s either banned or only done if medically indicated. Plenty of pet owners may not understand the negatives, so it is disappointing that so many American vets do not inform them and still perform the procedure. Your vet did not provide you with enough information to give informed consent for the procedure. I can imagine the guilt you felt, I would’ve felt it too!

Apparently in 2019, New York became the first state to ban declawing unless medically indicated. It boggles my mind that it’s still such a common thing in America, although at least progress is being made. Source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onychectomy"

cfs,fdvmy27,t3_en63na,1578749227.0,"As others have mentioned, you shouldn’t due to the risk to others. But even though you are doing okay at the moment, it would likely cause a flare of some sort. Especially since you mention having had POTS, which often involves low blood volume. 

Our bodies are very weak and deficient. There are things that add to our energy (like good nutrition, water intake, supplements, good rest, etc) and things that take away our energy (like digestion, using muscles, creating various things like blood and hormones and neurotransmitters, even thinking). Creating new blood takes precious energy. The more blood that is taken, the more your body has to work to replace it. So you not only have the immediate effects of suddenly lower circulating blood in a possibly already hypovolemic (low blood volume) system, but you’ve also got extra energy expenditure to consider. 

But you mostly need to think about the potential risk to others. It sucks that we can’t help out by giving blood, but it’s just not worth the risk to us or to others. I’d be super upset if I found out a loved one was put at risk from blood from a CFS sufferer, because it’s just such a shit disease."
cfs,fdvk8hg,t1_fdv0aju,1578748306.0,"I get where you’re coming from, but it’s not noble if there is the potential of the recipient getting sick. And there is the potential, because we have no idea if it can be passed on through blood or not. If your loved one got a horrible debilitating chronic illness from someone else’s blood, wouldn’t you be upset that that sock person thought it was okay to share their blood without knowing for sure they couldn’t pass it on?

Can you imagine if HIV positive people knew they were sick but didn’t know yet that it was blood borne, and some still gave blood? I think that if you are chronically ill and the cause of that illness is not fully understood, then it is a terrible idea to give blood. There are other things you can do to help out that don’t risk making others sick. Even if the risk is only tiny, do you really want to risk giving even one person this shitty life-stealing disease?"

cfs,fdozc5l,t1_fdoofjz,1578616327.0,"Yea #2 is the key here - we have no treatment, therefore what does being rich or poor have to do with our suffering? It’s not a case of being unable to afford treatment. He’s lucky that he’ll be able to afford supportive care, but even with people waiting on him hand and foot, I’m sure he still feels pretty fucking shit!

I hate when chronically ill people are so dismissive of other people’s suffering, like their own suffering matters more. It’s like how people say “at least you don’t have cancer” when they try to make you feel better - yea, cancer would really suck, but does that mean I shouldn’t feel bad about having CFS because someone else has it worse? Diminishing someone’s suffering because “they don’t have it as bad” is not cool."

So just check it intermittently and you will work out roughly what your HR is during different activities and can then see patterns of improvement or exacerbation. 

For me, when my POTS was bad, I’d have a rough idea on my HR laying down (55-65), sitting up with feet down (70-80) and standing (110-120). Then I could see my averages going down as my POTS improved."
cfs,fdc3ha9,t3_eke7xl,1578266364.0,"I use the watch face called “modular” and have the date and time with the smaller complications being heart rate, timer, activity and stopwatch. I don’t check heart rate much anymore, but it’s useful to help you learn to understand your symptoms when heart rate increases. 

I use timer and stopwatch for helping me do activities: eg. I aim to study for 1hr total today so I can set the stopwatch going when I study and pause when I have breaks. It can be hard to determine how much study I do when I have so many breaks, so this helps me feel accomplished. I also use the timer for doing stuff like chores or stretching: eg. do 5 mins of tidying, ONLY 5 mins! Helps me avoid overdoing it, but also helps motivate me since 5 mins doesn’t seem like long. 

I ignore the exercise ring on the activity app and just focus on the main ring. I don’t push to reach the goal if I don’t feel up to it, so I use it more as activity monitoring rather than activity motivating. I set the kilojoules/calories as the same each week, even when it suggests otherwise (currently at 840kj and I meet that roughly 4 days per week)."

Now I try to remind myself it’s ok to feel emotional and that it will pass once my system gets back on track. Still hard to feel those feelings at the time though. 

And that tiny voice worrying about losing all your progress - I definitely get that too! But maybe it’s a good thing, helping us to be more realistic in case things don’t go as planned and helping us to stay paranoid about overdoing it. My view is that my illness is like diabetes in that it can potentially be managed to the point of no symptoms but I’ll always have it and always need to manage it. Gives me hope of a better life without the potential false hope of being cured, so I think it’s the best way to be mentally prepared regardless of what my condition does. Realistic yet still hopeful."

cfs,fc52qyw,t1_fc51uro,1577440097.0,"My situation is different now, I’m studying part time but it’s a lot of prac work for I’m at college 2-3 days per week (usually 1 7hr day and 2 4hr days). But nonetheless, the method of building stamina using chores or other similar activities and then basically replacing that with your new work/study (and thus completely dialing back the chores) has been really beneficial for me. 

You just need to keep in mind that your house suddenly being a complete mess is not a step backwards - it’s a sideways step where you’ve just subbed in some other activity so you can eventually keep increasing your stamina. Also be sure to communicate with loved ones that you will decrease certain activities when you sub in that new job/study, so you don’t need the extra stress of them being let down or frustrated. Communicating about it can help them celebrate your successes too - my fiancé congratulated me when I’ve managed study plus keeping up with the bare minimum of chores (dishes and laundry mainly) because he knows where I’m at in my “subbing in” plan. I’m currently almost adjusted to study and building those basic chores back up. Hopefully this year I’ll be able to extend to keeping up with those basic chores plus study, even when I go through a mild flare. 

But that’s also a key aspect: be cool with going backwards in activity due to a flare, because adequate rest gets you back to increasing activity faster than pushing through, even though that feels like you’re going backwards. But it sounds like you’re already well on your way to acceptance and working within your limits!"

When I was housebound, I used chores as a way to increase my stamina - I’d increase what I could do till I was doing the daily dishes/laundry etc  as well as weekly jobs (sheets, clean shower, etc). But my next step was starting work one day a week in my mum’s shop. When I started that, I told my fiancé that the chores I did would sharply decline as my new job would steal that chore energy away. 

Once I became accustomed to my 1 day a week work, I slowly increased my chores again. Eventually, I could swap those extra chores for a second day of work per week on some weeks (not consecutive). But I always had to be prepared for setbacks if I got sick or overdid it. 

It sounds like you’ve got a great supportive family like me and that’s so helpful! I’m really glad you’ve had the opportunity to slowly increase your activity with support from loved ones like I have. It’s hard still though, so what you’ve achieved is amazing.

cfs,fc4q8v7,t3_eg3p28,1577424511.0,"I recently had a bout of tendinitis in my pinky fingers. In recent months, I’ve had a huge increase in generalised muscle pain (never been an issue before) which especially affected my shoulder girdle, elbows and fingers. I found that excessive typing and computer mouse use was aggravating it but I needed to do it because of my studies. So I taped my pinky to my ring finger and it really helped. Gave it the rest it needed. Note that you don’t want to tape 24/7 as it can weaken the muscles and make things worse, but you do need to rest the tendons during aggravating activities. 

My fiancé has a back brace for lower back pain and the physiological recommended he use it but specified to limit use for this reason. You can probably buy braces for elbows too - I know you can for knees. Might be a good option for giving your joints some support and limitation. 

Otherwise, google “taping for xxx” (insert whatever area is causing biggest issue) and look at images. That’s how I came up with different ideas on how to tape my fingers. You need to consider where it needs support. For example with my fingers, it was better to tape the tops of the metacarpals (long bones in palms) from pinky to index across the back and then around the front back to the pinky - this helped pull my pinky metacarpal into place better than going the opposite way. 

There are also some stretches that can help. I stretch each finger backwards whenever they are feeling stiff but I think there’s other things that can help too. Also I used zheng gu shui which was amazing (you can get it from an acupuncturist) but you can also use zen spray or other linaments.

An important factor in avoiding the pain for me is keeping them warm. If my hands get cold in air con, it definitely gets worse. I use fingerless gloves so I can still type and use my phone. My fiancé is always like “omg it’s not that cold” but I just tell him I don’t want to actually get cold in the first place."
