milwaukee,ffcobxk,t1_ffc0pej,1579803729.0,"The roof shingles will last longer because the solar panels protect them. The shingles get less wear because the weather falls on the panels instead of the shingles.

Also, ""remove and replace"" just means taking the panels and mounts off and setting them aside temporarily. You put the old panels back on when you're done. There's some labor costs involved, but it's not bad. You could do it yourself pretty easily, since the system is already designed."
