Needafriend,ff5mazc,t3_ernt1f,1579599962.0,"I lost a bf to Leukemia. It was a very short battle as well. Honestly, having been in your shoes before, I still don‚Äôt know what to say because most of it doesn‚Äôt help. At least not right now anyway. What I can say is cry as much as you want. Don‚Äôt even try to hold it in. Feel as openly as possible for the next few days. Trust me it helps al√≠viate the stress and emotional heaviness. There‚Äôs nothing worse than to be grieving AND worrying about what other people are thinking about you and how you‚Äôre handling things. If you have someone to be there for you then try to be with them whenever you can. I didn‚Äôt have anyone there for me and that was pretty tough. Most importantly, remember that you loved each other. Don‚Äôt focus on anything else cuz sometimes your mind is gonna go down the path of ‚Äúthe last thing we said to each other‚Äù or ‚Äúwe fought so many times for no reason‚Äù or ‚ÄúI should have told him this‚Äù. Just throw all that out the door cuz it‚Äôs in the past. Just focus on you loved each other."

This was leftover supplies from Maria that in part was unusable. ‚ÄúAllegedly‚Äù no allegedly nothing. Even the water was passed it‚Äôs expiration date, WATER. Do you know how long water is legally good for??? Yes I understand that if I was homeless and saw the government had a bunch of water they‚Äôre tossing because it‚Äôs passed it‚Äôs best by date I‚Äôd be upset too. But what most people don‚Äôt understand is that if for some crazy banana reason ANYTHING were to happen to me because of that water the government would be at fault. Yes I know there were other non perishable items but you can‚Äôt help the community without order. They wouldn‚Äôt just randomly decide to clean out this warehouse in the middle of a crisis if it was supposed to be a secret and risk exposure from employees. It needed to be cleaned out to assess what is useable and what is not before giving out anything to the community. I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm missing some huge key point here but political corruption or not this should not have been as big a deal as it turned out to be."

entitledparents,feu2e3b,t1_fesjju2,1579382449.0,It kind of rips something out of you doesn‚Äôt it? Not sure if it better or worse to have the days because you can say goodbye but you also watch them disintegrate.
entitledparents,fes0wph,t1_ferz11u,1579360270.0,I know. I‚Äôm not going to pretend I don‚Äôt think about the money. Especially when I‚Äôm out here putting $5 of gas in my car at a time. Would be nice not having to decide if I should eat 3 meals or if I should save one for tomorrow.  But I‚Äôve gotten to the point where it doesn‚Äôt bother me anymore. I can‚Äôt let it poison me.
entitledparents,feryvmm,t1_fervone,1579359771.0,"See, I think the difference was someone told us she was dead but she continued on with her life rather than her actually publicly faking her death. We were never able to confirm nor deny her death. Making it seem like her family was in on it. I think that‚Äôs why it wasn‚Äôt going to hold up in court. She could argue she never said she was dead and that she was at home and at work."
