AskReddit,ff55s22,t3_erc1ft,1579581026.0,"I can tell you that some people suffering from depression absolutely do not want to be coddled. My partner (who suffers from depression) hates (with a passion) the whole beating around the bush people are proposing here. He would rather I say ""i've had enough"" and walk away than to go ""oh um, i love you , but this and that and polite language""  


This applies to a lot of people. Each situation is different ofc, but sometimes, the best way is to literally spit it out. Doesn't mean you're being rude, or don't care or love them."

YouShouldKnow,fcp81kq,t3_ehp52m,1577853581.0,Not sure about most countries but here in Australia the big retailers give their cashier's power to refuse to pack bags based on hygiene and at my particular retailer we can refuse to life bags that are deemed too heavy for us if a customer refuses to provide enough bags.
YouShouldKnow,fcp7mks,t3_eicifn,1577853169.0,At the same time though. If you're unsure about something absolutely get medical advice. Not necessarily by calling an ambulance. If you have symptoms you don't recognise or are feeling something that doesn't fit with the illness you might think you have please seek attention.
YouShouldKnow,fcp7gzw,t3_ei98hi,1577853016.0,You should also know that alot of people who have them wished they had not. Not in a malicious way. They just weren't fulfilled with their kids in the way that they were led to believe by society.
