Outdoors,ff82aif,t3_es5yic,1579664112.0,This is so beautiful. Walking through these flowers would be dreamlike.
Scorpio,ff20e3k,t1_ff1qeds,1579490465.0,What have they been in the past? We’re supposed to vibe with Cancers the best outside of Scorpios. I think Pisces come second after them.
CHIBears,ff1zuw4,t1_ff1zkjx,1579490079.0,I agree but his eyes were watering a lot and it looked like he was crying during his close-up.
CHIBears,ff1y8n8,t3_eqqdzf,1579488927.0,The Superbowl trophy should be named after George Halas. The man literally founded the league. I don’t understand that to this very day.
CHIBears,ff1x0n5,t3_eqqdzf,1579488115.0,Aaron looks like he’s crying.
CHIBears,ff1la92,t3_eqqdzf,1579481017.0,The best part is that it’s only the first half.
Scorpio,ff1l61k,t3_er522k,1579480960.0,I’ve heard Scorpio is the only sign compatible witn each other. I have no idea how it’s possible but they just say it works.
CHIBears,ff1kf1s,t3_eqqdzf,1579480612.0,What a beautiful day.
CHIBears,ff1hwlt,t3_eqqdzf,1579479490.0,What makes this even better is that Aaron can’t stand the 49ers and we all know it.
CHIBears,ff1hbz9,t3_eqqdzf,1579479229.0,I’m so happy for Robbie. He did so much for the Bears and he truly deserves this.
CHIBears,fezmst0,t3_eqz5tt,1579459112.0,"That’s so cool, you can order it online? Does it taste the same?"
AdviceAnimals,feuy26h,t1_feugd6z,1579391046.0,He tried to grab it out of nowhere? That’s so wrong and messed up. Were you in public?
AdviceAnimals,fet607c,t3_eqeszm,1579372141.0,As a gay guy this is 100% accurate. It’s always the repulsively unattractive ones that say stuff like this. Like eww... don’t even flatter yourself. Does making remarks like this make them feel better or something? The straight men I’ve only ever found attractive are the supporters and allies.
wholesomememes,fep660p,t1_fep5dhm,1579313010.0,Quite possibly. The writing is different than what it used to be but it’s still a great show to watch in your free time.

wholesomememes,feoggbt,t1_feocy02,1579299815.0,That sounds like so much fun! I’m 20 and anytime I come across an episode I turn it into a full marathon. The best part is that it’s relatable to so many people across different walks of life.
wholesomememes,feo7apd,t3_eq698q,1579296093.0,SpongeBob brought so much light and positivity to my childhood. In present day it doesn’t get the credit it deserves.
gaybros,feo28vo,t3_eq5y0b,1579294147.0,Overall I think those apps are used to get attention and/or waste people’s time and no one who uses them ever takes them seriously.

CHIBears,feldebt,t1_fel1cw6,1579219551.0,I don’t think I’ve seen one single Lions fan in that sub for obvious reasons. It’s pretty sad but there really isn’t anything they can post without people shitting on them for their record.
CHIBears,fel18a8,t1_fel0n4v,1579211865.0,"Ah thank you, that’s nice to know. I never followed the Titans during the regular season but I can only assume he’s not worthy of a ring. I guess we’ll see though."
CHIBears,fel0an3,t3_epp3db,1579211313.0,"He was released from the Titans back in November, he’s a free agent right now. They could still give him a ring?"
goldenknights,fekbw8o,t3_epmn2b,1579196817.0,“A little awkward” is the understatement of the century.

CHIBears,fek7za4,t3_epklsw,1579194505.0,"Everytime I post in there I get negative comments or downvoted without even saying anything biased, it totally makes sense who the majority of the members are."
gaybros,fehal29,t1_feh08hz,1579112595.0,"Wow, it’s so crazy how time flies. I was 7 so you’re only two years older than me, but I barely remember the game back when it actually happened. I still rewatch old clips to refresh my memory even though it didn’t end well for the Bears. Always stick with your team though, loyalty is the best part of being a fan."
Scorpio,feh8kfs,t1_feh8b7n,1579111376.0,"Yep, lol he’s as much of a scorpio as it gets."
CHIBears,feh2qgv,t3_ep41hd,1579107921.0,Something’s telling me next season will either be one of our best or one of our worst seasons ever. I really hope it’s the former but only time will tell at this point.
goldenknights,fegzt98,t3_ep3tpt,1579106159.0,"There’s way more to the story than they’re telling us for PR reasons. There’s no way a coach who takes us to the playoffs for three consecutive years is fired so abruptly, especially when the season’s not even over and we have beyond a winning record. Definitely more going on."
gaybros,fefprrr,t1_fedpxd5,1579061766.0,I think you’re talking about the Superbowl where they beat my team. Lol I’m a huge Bears fan. That had to be the rainiest Superbowl of all time! It’s nice knowing there are other football fans in this sub.
gaybros,fefp4vr,t3_eoeggg,1579061315.0,"r/nfl is a great place to get started. Eventually you’ll probably become a fan of an individual team, there’s 32 of them. Once you start watching your first few games it should all make sense for the most. Besides the Championship games and the Superbowl this current season is over, but there’s still things you can learn in the offseason."
CHIBears,fefnj2d,t3_eov9fx,1579060209.0,"We do deserve better, he is absolutely right. We have one of the most loyal fanbases in the league and it’s sad how we’ve had to settle for mediocrity."

CHIBears,feae5sp,t3_eo77qo,1578947511.0,@OP the last one’s entire comment history is sad. What a miserable life he must live.
CHIBears,fe8ppdr,t1_fe7wx5b,1578929018.0,"Well honestly after watching yesterday’s games their o-lines look just as bad if not worse. Regardless, Mitch has done great several times this season and failed several times. Watson and Wilson did great in the Wild Card and came up short yesterday under the same circumstances. You can’t always judge Trubs raw performance when he’s not getting any help, just like with them."
nfl,fe6nteh,t3_enxaz3,1578897408.0,Lmao they’re laughing like they’re in a comedy club. I mean it was funny but damn.
CHIBears,fe6nf6r,t3_env9hg,1578896973.0,Pace was on the hot seat during the entire game.
CHIBears,fe67k5a,t1_fe672ug,1578883556.0,This would bring so much controversy if it actually happened. I don’t see GB winning next week though.
CHIBears,fe5z6r5,t3_en9b75,1578878206.0,I’d rather see GB lose the Championship game than this game. But I also don’t want them to just be one game away from the Superbowl. I’m speechless.
nfl,fe5s0pc,t1_fe5ryjd,1578873691.0,But they still do. All the time.
nfl,fe5qyr0,t1_fe5qv1c,1578873284.0,As a Bears fan I gladly agree.
nfl,fe5hnwm,t3_ens4mf,1578869523.0,The Texans are making this game boring.
CHIBears,fe55s8n,t1_fe51q77,1578865894.0,That has nothing to do with what I said. Key words are “allows him to be”. Mariota never took advantage of that opportunity.
nfl,fe4vu5u,t1_fe4vno2,1578863258.0,Exactly.
nfl,fe4r8nr,t3_ens4mf,1578862028.0,Was that the Chuck E. Cheese mouse?

nfl,fe4jopx,t3_ens4mf,1578860033.0,Does State Farm even get more customers off of these commercials?
CHIBears,fe3omdp,t1_fe3nitx,1578851386.0,Is that what the stats are showing? They did not look average in the slightest.
CHIBears,fe3lues,t1_fe3kb3g,1578850492.0,"In reference to what I replied to someone else, of course they performed at higher levels. I said as good as his offensive line “allows him to be”. The point of my comment was that any offensive line better than ours would’ve allowed him to do at least something. I’ve not once seen Seattle or Houston’s line perform as badly as ours this season."
CHIBears,fe3jzad,t1_fe3frs0,1578849953.0,I don’t recall any of the teams playing today having an o-line as bad as ours was. That’s not a fair comparison.
CHIBears,fe3hc0s,t1_fe3ew2r,1578849273.0,"Right, that’s what I meant by “allowed” him to be. He didn’t take advantage of that opportunity this year."
CHIBears,fe3dgsi,t3_enpg3o,1578848317.0,"A quarterback is only as good as his offensive line allows him to be. It doesn’t matter how top tier they are, without protection they can’t do anything."

nfl,fe029l2,t3_eni563,1578801272.0,No one could’ve predicted how these playoffs were gonna turn out. That’s what I love about football.
nfl,fe01246,t3_eng8ob,1578800468.0,I don’t think the Ravens are frauds but the Titans are way better than they get credit for.
nfl,fe004kk,t3_eng8ob,1578799882.0,Lol the 54 sarcasm though.
nfl,fdzzm8n,t3_eng8ob,1578799580.0,This game is real. Like this is really happening right now.
nfl,fdzyu37,t3_eng8ob,1578799094.0,It would be really cool to see the Titans in the Superbowl.
nfl,fdzxode,t3_eng8ob,1578798323.0,That somersault should be in the Olympics.
nfl,fdzwyq5,t1_fdzwb61,1578797813.0,"Yeah, being a visiting fan in the Bay Area must be rough."

nfl,fdzs7jc,t3_eng8ob,1578794555.0,I knew this game wasn’t gonna be a blowout like people were saying.
NFCNorthMemeWar,fdznw9s,t3_enfog4,1578792216.0,If anything they should’ve been rooting for the Vikings for home field advantage.
nfl,fdzdfum,t1_fdzcpor,1578789172.0,Indeed. Congrats on the win.
nfl,fdzchl0,t3_enfzgc,1578788899.0,George Kittle is really good at talking to the media.

nfl,fdz7qce,t3_end9mc,1578787521.0,Yes we all heard it Collinsworth.
nfl,fdz5fxt,t3_end9mc,1578786886.0,I’m just genuinely confused how the Saints lost to them. Did they not practice or something?
nfl,fdz0u6d,t3_end9mc,1578785523.0,The Katie Sowers commercial is one of the only ones I like. Such an inspiration.
nfl,fdyy7qt,t3_end9mc,1578784729.0,I don’t know if this game is boring or if it’s just NBC.
nfl,fdywqxm,t1_fdywf7r,1578784323.0,I thought I was the only one thinking that.

nfl,fdiak02,t3_elifsb,1578438711.0,"The NFL needs to realize that more and more people are statistically getting rid of cable, so the ratings for MNF will never rise or be where they used to be. Even an all-star announcing crew isn’t gonna change that. What they need to do is bring it back to ABC so a wider audience can tune in."
gaybros,fdh3sqa,t1_fdgi475,1578414767.0,"The “not taking anything seriously” persona is a big one. You can’t even think to try and work up to a relationship with them because all they wanna do is be overly sexual and fool around with everyone. This isn’t exclusive to gay men because there are plenty of straight men like this too, but with straights I’ve noticed it’s something they do up to like high school and maybe college for some. Gay men go fully into their 20s and even 30s being like this. Most of them were closeted or bullied into not doing stuff like that in their high school and younger years, so it makes sense why they would try to re-live it when they’re out and adults. I’m no psychiatrist but that’s just what I’ve observed over the past few years."
nfl,fdf8hu3,t3_el1pwd,1578355763.0,I just can’t get over how much Mike Pereira sounds like Phil Dunphy.

CHIBears,fdewqdg,t3_ekw3xc,1578348200.0,There’s too much power in the coin toss with these current rules. It’s like if you lose the toss you’re a single step away from losing the game. Something about that just doesn’t seem right to me.
CHIBears,fdecovi,t3_ekt5gj,1578336140.0,"I would love for this, but Brady is gonna need a lot of protection considering he’s not really a mobile guy. Trubs would also learn a lot from him. But if it hasn’t been said enough already, our o-line ain’t it chief."
gaybros,fdd3x1z,t1_fdd0ua0,1578293743.0,"I agree with the school system and work place parts, but I’m saying it’s different with gay men in my experience. A huge portion of them trying to re-live their childhood is what I believe pushes them back maturity wise compared to straight men in the same environments."
CHIBears,fdbwoxm,t3_ekjfd8,1578263039.0,"I was obviously hoping for a Viking loss, especially with that push off at the end. Seeing this picture made me happy it was the other way around. The Saints would’ve annoyed me just as much going into the divisional round."
gaybros,fdbsgzc,t3_ek5624,1578261273.0,"As a 20 year old I tend to notice a severe lack of maturity in gay men altogether, but especially in their early-mid 20’s. I believe it has to do with most of them being robbed of their childhood and them trying to 
re-live it. I don’t have the time or patience to deal with that especially because I wasn’t robbed of mine, and so I have more of an attraction to guys older than me. And quite frankly there are some really really attractive men in their 30’s."
nfl,fdb0vj4,t3_ekg3f9,1578252451.0,That play clock hit zero. The refs need to get it together.
