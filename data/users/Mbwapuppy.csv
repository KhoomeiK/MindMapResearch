dogs,ffd3fy6,t1_ffcsg97,1579812663.0,"I'd dispute that. Well-bred Rottweilers are biddable, stable and versatile. I think the reasons people describe them as ""difficult"" include (1) the fact that there are so many shit breeders producing unsound dogs, and (2) the fact that an untrained Rottweiler is, literally and figuratively, a much bigger problem than, say, an untrained pug. 

Training-wise, thinking effort-to-yield, Rottweilers are actually pretty easy. Because they're owner/handler-focused, they like to learn, and things such as loose-leash walking and recall involve building on inclinations they already have. Because they're ""smart,"" they catch on quickly. A tiny six-year-old girl taught our late Rottweiler ""go around."" Took maybe 15 minutes."

On a day like today, when it’s 25F/-4C out and windy, the dog gets a morning potty trip (after people’s breakfast, before the dog’s breakfast), an afternoon walk, an evening potty trip (after the dog’s dinner), and a bedtime potty trip. The length of the walk is up to the dog. He’ll signal that he's had enough and wants to head home.
