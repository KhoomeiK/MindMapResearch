Lepto is more iffy (Roslindale, maybe recently?) but not a huge deal.  The benefits of going out, in a sensible way, are clear. My vet’s been in practice for a few decades, and he lives here.

dogs,ffo97ae,t1_ffntmg2,1580075294.0,"No, it’s not that pit bulls are uniquely aggressive. It’s that pit bull *owners* seem uniquely oblivious and inconsiderate. No one says their Rottweiler or German shepherd or Jack Russell terrier would never hurt a fly."
dogs,ffo6tls,t1_ffntjd4,1580074721.0,"Proper training is key, sure. But it’s a mistake to underestimate the power of genetic hardwiring. Aggression toward other dogs often kicks in with full physical maturity, like 1-3 years of age. That dog you knew may or may not have turned out differently with proper training. Also, just in general, dog parks aren’t necessarily beneficial."

It helps to live in an area with zero strays and educated owners. (I think we’re kinda-sorta neighbors.) My current dog spent a lot of puppy time on a college campus and in a park adjacent to a high school. He experienced his first marching band practice at around 10 weeks of age and has been a fan ever since."

Humping being about sex."
dogs,ffmqe6e,t1_ffmm0rp,1580057881.0,"If the dog's all right with being picked up, I would carry her up and down the stairs for now. You just got her yesterday. New people, new places, new activities, new contraptions—-that's a lot to process—so take that one big stressor of getting in and out off of her plate, and give her a couple weeks to settle in.

Eventually, I'd start working on stairs, beginning with outdoor stairs that are wide and easy. Churches on weekdays can be good places for that. College/school buildings can work too, during less trafficky times.

I'd work on the elevator last."
dogs,ffmlqxv,t3_eu8sf5,1580056393.0,Some questions: What floor are you on? How does the dog respond to the stairs? How big is the dog?
dogs,ffmclpq,t1_fflykji,1580052402.0,"If the dog needs work on verbal cues but has the hand signals down, I think it may be best to give them one after the other rather than at the same time: word, then gesture. Eventually, you should be able to drop the signal. Am chatting, not arguing."

dogs,ffks3zl,t1_ffkrsoq,1580027903.0,"I don’t think we necessarily disagree. I am describing how words are actually used, and you are describing how you think they should be used."
dogs,ffkrlj1,t1_ffkln89,1580027651.0,"The term isn’t “confused,” though. It just has two overlapping meanings. One is an umbrella term; the other is a breed name. Which is meant is clear from context."
dogs,ffkiyvl,t1_ffk4dp7,1580023542.0,“Pit bull” in American English is both an umbrella term for a type of dog and the name of a specific breed (APBT). It’s not particularly confusing.

I think about a student I had who was very passionate about not buying bottled water and such, then went on a grant-funded airplane trip to and from a poor country to “help” build a dam... and build her resume. Nice girl, and not knocking the spirit. Just I think it’s a complicated topic.

They rummaged around and left after 3 minutes. They didn’t grab obvious stuff like the laptop. Just doesn’t seem like the kind of crew that would come prepared to poison a dog. So unless you had rat poison sitting in clear view next to the cookies or something, I would guess your dog is ok. Again, sorry for the terrible experience."

dogs,ffila44,t1_ffikjdg,1579976581.0,"Yes, that one. Try it. Most dogs like it. As for not being interested in his own food--it's actually pretty common for dogs to like cat food better than dog food. If you think that's the issue, then keeping the dog as unaware as possible of the cat food should help. Put dog in kitchen or somewhere, feed cat in bedroom, then take any remaining cat food away.

And also, grain-free foods have been linked to heart disease, so you really don't want to feed them unless there's a vet-confirmed reason to do so. In your position, I would try something such as Pro Plan Sensitive Skin & Stomach, which comes in salmon and lamb formulas.

As for the logistical stuff, you could try feeding the pets in your room at different times, giving each of them 15 minutes or so, then taking up any food that remains."
