Animorphs,ff7a0uf,t1_ff6vbdg,1579644261.0,"Residuals/Royalties are pretty common, particularly for books.  Also, if a work sells well, even if they're getting paid a flat rate, it makes them more likely to get rehired, so they still benefit.

There are certainly cases where a shitty company swindles a creator somehow, laughs all the way to the bank, and then tells them to go fuck themselves, but it's rare enough that I would argue it's not a major concern."
Animorphs,ff79ksc,t1_ff66vrb,1579643924.0,"That's pretty impressively missing the point. If I download one, or two, or three hundred copies of *The Invasion*, Scholastic loses nothing. If you take money out of my bank account, whether physically, digitally, or magically, I lose the money."
Animorphs,ff5tgtt,t1_ff4vhsx,1579609618.0,"1. Wanting to get a crack at that sweet Power Rangers money. The Goosebumps also show started a year or so before, targeted the same demo, and did decently well, even if it was garbage.

2. It's not like there weren't very successful live action sci-fi/fantasy shows happening around the time. There were two Star Treks going on, Babylon 5, Buffy was doing well, X-Files was in its prime years, SG-1 started around the same time. I think they could've made it work, if they'd had the proper budget, a better crew, etc."
todayilearned,ff4zm8v,t1_ff4vscw,1579576302.0,"It's really not. To use the world police metaphor, America's problem is that they SWAT everything, shoot the dog, and then leave while the house is on fire. There's nothing wrong with intervening in foreign countries where it's justified and with a proper plan. We had neither in Iraq, and that's why it turned into a shit show."
Animorphs,ff4g7vc,t1_fezkhnq,1579562854.0,"Since you're not actually taking anything away from anyone (it's not like downloading a book makes a copy disappear from Scholastic's warehouse) it's not stealing. I would generally encourage people to buy legal copies of works they like, support creators, etc., but that doesn't change the fact that it's not the same thing."
Animorphs,feyck0u,t1_fexkj9w,1579443767.0,"It would, and I think the content level would also be a good fit there. I'm still waiting for there to be a ""big"" web serial in the west. *Worm* is probably closest we've gotten, and it's got a lot of the same themes as Animorphs."
Animorphs,feufx1x,t1_fetuwq5,1579386118.0,"No. Stop digging yourself in deeper when you obviously have no clue what you're talking about. There is no accepted ""definition"" for what a short story is based on length. If there was, it would certainly be well under 30K, even 20K is pushing the upper end of what most people consider a short story."
Animorphs,feufkd5,t1_fetv1n6,1579386004.0,"Animorphs is weird. Format-wise, they're right on the border between the upper end of chapter books (in that there's a gazillion of them, cranked out roughly monthly when they were current) and lower Middle Grade (in that there's some degree of continuity between the books.)

Content-wise, they'd probably fall into Young Adult/Teen. The violence is quite graphic, the themes are relatively mature, etc. 

I think you'd be hard pressed to find a publisher for them today. Most companies wouldn't touch that level of violence in kids/lower MG with a ten foot pole, but I don't know that the market is there for a monthly series in upper MG/YA. Maybe you could spin it as a gimmick, ""NEW ADVENTURES EVERY MONTH!"" or something, I dunno."
Animorphs,fets4ji,t1_fetl1eu,1579379365.0,"The Animorphs books are not short stories.

1. They're a completely normal length for an intermediate level children's novel, which is what they are. You can go into any major bookstore in America and find entire shelves of books that're about the same length. 

2. If they were adult books, and kept the same length, they'd most likely be classified as novellas. No one is calling a 20K+ word book a short story. Novellas are less popular than full length novels, but you can certainly find them at most bookstores as well. *The Metamorphosis* is shorter than most of the books, as are plenty of other classics like *Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.* James Patterson has an entire line of them, and they seem to be doing alright."
Animorphs,fetfbxl,t1_fet67m5,1579374880.0,"You do know that the Animorphs books were originally published as kid lit, and that their length is pretty standard for the age group/genre, right?"

Battletechgame,fe4m52g,t1_fe49pc7,1578860762.0,">Problem is that most game developers don’t actually do this

It's been a pretty standard approach since the mid 90s actually.

Battletechgame,fe2bnz8,t3_enmfo3,1578836609.0,"Multiplayer was the last Kickstarter goal, and they made it pretty clear it was never a development priority. The moment they said that balance in SP would be the same as balance in MP, they pretty much nailed the coffin shut. I can't think of any successful MP game in recent memory that was balanced around SP. Beyond that, some basic features like matchmaking/ranking are fairly important, maybe running events and such from time to time."
politics,fdwqw7p,t1_fdwm3b3,1578761438.0,"This is an obviously bullshit number, and I can't believe people keep parroting it and expecting it to be believed. A huge percentage of people are working their second job off the books. Others are working ""one"" job, but are actually filling (and hopefully getting paid for) two or more positions."
Battletechgame,fdez3cf,t1_fdej44p,1578349669.0,"Doesn't it run out of ammo several times in the series? Sounds like the answer to, ""Where do you put the ammo?"" is, ""You don't!"""
Animorphs,fda43nw,t3_ekey6t,1578241403.0,"Has anyone found out why the books are getting republished in Vietnam right now, and why they seem to be putting so much effort into it? They're already further along than they got with the US reprints last time, and they've gone to the trouble of putting together new covers. Was Animorphs really big in Vietnam? Is YA fiction a big new market there and they're just reprinting old titles to try and cash in?"

I'm pretty sure exactly zero of the Democratic front runners are interested in firearms confiscation. The most popular proposals seem to be bringing back some variant of the 90s assault weapons ban, tweaks to the background check system and limiting mag sizes. How do you convince someone that something they had no reason to believe in the first place isn't true?"

You'd either name the actual source, or leave the source out entirely. It's like when someone tells you a story about their cousin's boyfriend, it's an extraneous detail that's there to try to make it more believable, but does the opposite."
LeftieZ,fc9oq3i,t1_fc9l6vn,1577555876.0,"So that would be a no for any actual evidence of your claim, a no for this actually being brigading, and a cringey attempt at a personal appeal? Are you finished embarrassing yourself, or hoping to farm this for some ""SO MUCH FOR THE TOLERANT CTRL-LEFT, AMIRITE?"""
LeftieZ,fc9kizp,t1_fc9eqnq,1577554020.0,"1\. That's a pretty impressive non sequitur you got there. Didja want to answer the topic we were discussing?

2\. I'm not seeing anything about such a ban in TD's rules, the quarantine announcement, or anywhere else I can find. Didja want to back up your point, or are you just talking out your ass? In good faith [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/4u9bbg/please_define_vote_brigading/) the closest thing I can find to a definition on vote brigading.

You'll notice that planning to shitpost (or even successfully shitposting) isn't even close to covered. If the post was made successfully, and then linked here, it would possibly be brigading under certain circumstances. You've thrown out a ban, then for some reason decided to pick a fight on another sub, about three steps before the possible brigading here. 

Granted, there's nothing wrong with you, as a mod, just banning anyone for shitposting or whatever. I've said many times that reddit would benefit from a culture of stricter moderation. I know that when I've been a mod on other forums, etc. I banned people for considerably less than what most subreddits allow. I've never even posted on your sub, and I'm banned, I think because I tried to explain that people that are against bigotry don't magically stop being against it when you change the name of the people doing it on SPS once. SPS, obviously, being a sub whose very existence is right on the line between brigading and not. I'm sure you regularly ban users who post there also, since you're totally unbiased.

3\. Just to hazard a guess, even though you're clearly asking in bad faith, and if such a rule did exist, it might have something to do with the fact that TD is a quarantine board (which is not the same as being Quarantined) whose entire purpose is to try and segregate the trolls, and other undesirables, into a single space, hoping they'll mostly just stay there and avoid damaging the rest of the site.

This has been tried on other websites, probably most notably the *chans, and, AFAIK, has never actually worked. Again reddit is known for it's relatively lax moderation standards, which is why TD can exist at all, so they went with it anyway."
LeftieZ,fc95otg,t1_fc7ef57,1577547446.0,"I like how your explanation for how this is ""brigading"" is to explain that it's pre banned for possibly doing something that also isn't brigading. Haven't you lot been circling jerking yourselves into a coma over due process for the last month or so? I understand that ""rules for thee, but none for me"" is one of the core principals of conservatism, but you're out in public here, you could at least pretend to have a smidge of integrity."

GamerGhazi,fc4jidx,t1_fc3zpqf,1577418483.0,"I'm not trying to be snarky here, but aren't the two nearly interchangeable? ""Traditional White America"" (to me) means dad's in charge of the family, and he's a good ol' boy who knows America is the best country in the world, and if you don't agree with him/his pastor/the President he'll kick your commie ass. 

Traditional White America means that them colored folks don't come around your part of town much, and if they did you could be sure a good citizen would keep an eye on them, or maybe the cops will come and give him a good kick in the ass to point him the right direction.

Traditional White America means that most colored folks probably couldn't vote. Sure, they could legally, thanks to them city slickers in DC, but wouldn't you know it, they only have one voting machine in that part of town and it's broken. The women probably shouldn't vote either, but as long as they don't get their heads full of that feminist nonsense and vote the way their husband or their daddy tell them, it shouldn't do any harm.

Traditional White America means that they don't play that hip hop on the radio. The way they talk about women is just awful. I'd never talk to my wife that way, even if I have to slap her around every now and then. And they don't show any of them gay-porno movies like Brokeback Mountain in the theatre. It's not that they don't like the gays, it's just that they don't want it shoved down their throat.

Like, it's not Nazi Germany, but it's a culture where everyone knows their place, and everyone knows whose in charge, because they're just better than everyone else by virtue of being middle aged, white, male, and having some money."
