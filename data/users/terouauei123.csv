They had no access to the Internet and other material that helps us understand the psychology of things, so I consider myself a better person thanks to my experience and the material I have been reading and watching for the past years. I forgave them a long time ago.

What I hope people don't do is: blame them, don't forgive them and use that as an excuse for your failures. You know what's wrong now. 

So fix it. Blaming is useless."

getdisciplined,fck2xjv,t3_ehil3t,1577714995.0,"From personal experience, working out is like a meditation to me. I love to look good with a nice shirt, a nice watch and a nice tan. You don't need to look like Brad Pitt. Basic hygiene, athletic physique and nice clothes (nice, not expensive) is all you need to start. I used to be fat and I made a promise to never again. But I'll admit, sometimes I don't want to go to the gym, but in those times I do the opposite: my best workouts are when I don't want to go.

It's like a positive self-punishment. So good. You can do it too."
getdisciplined,fc59dyq,t3_eeul88,1577449737.0,"Thanks for putting this into words. I have been reading books and listening to podcasts\\videos about depression, feelings of hopelessness and lack of focus\\purpose. I am 34 and only in the last 4 years, I found out this. I could never get into social circles and dinners, events, parties, because I didn't feel needed. I also was and still am very dissatisfied with my current career. Adding to that, my girlfriend for no reason stopped talking to me. With her, I try to be the best I can be, she doesn't know I feel this way but we all know women can tell. Whenever she asks me for something and she says she needs me, it feels wonderful. I am needed. What I am feeling right now is that I am not needed.

Not at home, not to her, not at my job. So, if I am not needed, what's the point. I am a very disciplined person,but I found myself feeling not needed."
