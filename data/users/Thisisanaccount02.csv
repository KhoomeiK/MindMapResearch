hawks,ff81pl3,t1_ff81539,1579663686.0,"Sure could be worse point wise. I'm curious about where he was this time the past couple seasons. His play just overall looks worse. Can't pass, can't shoot, can't defend, etc. So while it's not the worst thing in the world, he can play much better than he currently is. Sometimes guys have an off season, but I hope he can maybe pick it up when strome is back and after a nice break. If not, I'm sure next season will be better."

todayilearned,febxu07,t1_feaxqpp,1578964035.0,"If that was the case on my roads it would be a different story. People, for reasons unknown to me, like to go 5 under everywhere for no obvious reason, and they do it in the passing lanes all the time so you can't pass anyone on a 3 lane road. I really wish I understood why people around here drive like that, but I still haven't figured it out. It leads me to believe they are dumb, oblivious, or just power tripping."

Try to pass someone going under the speed limit and watch them do everything they can to prevent it because fuck you for thinking you can pass me. Sometimes it's people fucking off on their phones, some people have seemingly serious power/control issues, and lots of just dumb people."
todayilearned,fealmn6,t1_fea9led,1578950133.0,"I noticed this when I was in the UK a few months ago. My brother was the driver, but people used their lights when overtaking or to let someone know they could come over in the lane. It was really nice actually.

hockey,fe4jor7,t1_fe4e4lb,1578860033.0,"I'm pointing out the hypocrisy of the cheering for sucker punches comment because you guys cheer for the same thing. The guy you think is dirty was part of the same comment. Implying that you think tkachuk is clean. I haven't seen you say anything about his sportsmanship aside from other people call him dirty which you don't agree with and he's not squeaky clean. 
All the while calling other people hypocrites. 

Idk why you put that link down. I'm obviously not talking about this specific game"
hockey,fe4dogd,t1_fe4bjje,1578858180.0,"Everyone is claiming he's cleaned up his game. Your comments imply he's a clean player in your book. ""guy you think is dirty"" ""cheering for sucker punches"" 
A bit hypocritical. Dach probably went down so easy because he wasn't expecting an unprovoked check for no fucking reason after a whistle. It was a dirty shot from a dirty player. He might not intentionally injure guys but that doesn't mean he's not dirty. It's hypocritical."
hockey,fe489it,t1_fe06iai,1578856712.0,He hit Dach well after a whistle after you guys scored for no reason other than he was a couple feet from him minding his own business. He's not a squeaky clean player by any means.
