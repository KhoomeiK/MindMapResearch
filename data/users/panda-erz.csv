technology,fffu927,t1_fffmwko,1579891917.0,"I was jumped for my bike in an alleyway as a kid and I remembered one of the guys using the others name. Cops wouldn't even look into it when my dad called, so he called up the neighbor kid who was in his late teens. He had my bike back in an hour. The police are absolutely useless when it comes to helping out average people, but damn do they ever find the time to set up spot checks and speed traps."

My partner started unloading to me about how hard it is on her and all the stress it's causing and all the things I've done in the past. I just politely said I don't have enough room in my brain to help myself and another person right now and instead tried to brainstorm some other people she could talk to in place  of me for the time being.

news,fedovlw,t1_fecpyli,1579016681.0,"I'm a dude, so it's much less likely to happen to me. We used to have a guy who we called regularly and he was the nicest man ever, even came to get me in his personal car a couple times to make sure we had a safe ride home when he wasn't working. 

He picked up some food for my gf once on his way to get me because I said she was staying home sick and wouldn't be coming out that night. I would usually bring him some snacks or drinks because long nights means hungry belly. 

Unfortunately he moved back home so we had to branch out and find some new options."

That shits weird and uneccesary."

She ended up calling me during the ride and saying that she's almost home and she'll see me soon. I wasn't home, but I got the picture. Some of those guys are just fucking gross. 

If she's alone now I'll just call her an uber from my app, doesn't seem to be an issue when it's ordered from a guys name."
