I'm at that point where i'll even take just the feeling of being in love with someone, despite being fully aware that it will most likely never be reciprocated.

It is pain, but at least a sweeter kind of pain."
depression,ff4f1n3,t3_erf20x,1579562062.0,"I'm fantastically unimportant. All my life i've been stuck outside the fences life, looking in.

For a relatively short while recently, i thought i saw a light in the darkness - but the closer i try to move to it, the more it seems to move away.
It feels like this rare moment too is leaving me now.
I don't know any more. I always expect to be abandoned in the end.

Everything seems pointless."
depression,fewnfc2,t1_fewlafh,1579415701.0,"Pretty sad that many people only really seem to start understanding it once they suffer from it themselves.

Maybe thats what it's about with physical health too. Everyone bumped their knee once, everyone was sick once - so it's much easier to relate."
introvert,fevl428,t1_fes5pag,1579398705.0,Nice one.
lonely,fevksia,t3_eqbp7t,1579398582.0,I'm in this kind of pain right now :) Feels like suffocating.
lonely,fevhao5,t3_eqi8j8,1579397427.0,"Yeah, in 99.9% of cases it's me who is doing the reaching out. And since i'm more of an introvert, it takes a lot of energy and getting over my own anxieties and doubts before it even happens.

I'm getting so tired of it all .."
lonely,fegvfyy,t3_ep2ek7,1579103423.0,I'm realizing this more and more too.
lonely,fegv921,t3_ep2wpg,1579103301.0,Oh well.
depression,fe6bdeb,t1_fe107mb,1578886115.0,Fun times indeed.
lonely,fdcn9lc,t3_ekm7j6,1578279135.0,"A lot of this sounds very familiar ..

I wish i could talk openly with certain people, but i'm afraid to scare them away or burden them - and end up destroying this rare moment in time. I'm not worth it anyway."
depression,fdclvfa,t3_ekeedb,1578278139.0,"I gave up on the whole idea pretty early on in my life.
And for a long time i was able to distract ( and isolate ) myself and not think about it too much.

I'm a good bit older than you, and after some especially dark recent years i let my guard down and started to realize what i might have been missing all this time.

But i also know that, even if someone accepted me, i wouldn't be able to give them what they want, need and deserve, and ultimately just waste their life-time.

So now i'm just waiting for something that makes the pain go away, whatever it may be."
depression,fct1on6,t1_fcquh2t,1577930575.0,"I know what you mean. One of my brothers died of cancer a few years back.

He loved life, had a family, believed in god, but more than that believed in people. He made the world a better place because he genuinely cared about others.

I'm barely a human being, broken and afraid - propped up by little more than daydreams at this point.

I never really lived and i'm running out of time to do so anyway.
It should have been me."
