HongKong,fh2egl7,t1_fh29yzk,1581248990.0,I'm a good customer!  Do what I say or I'll leave and you'll be sad!
todayilearned,fh2cs7d,t1_fh270oz,1581246555.0,"It's because there's no law on the books that covers this.  Misrepresenting yourself online isn't a crime, and because she didn't directly say 'stab him' there's no way to apply manslaughter charges.

There's clearly wrongdoing and there absolutely needs to be a law covering this, but she didn't do anything legally wrong by current standards.

Good to see the actual murderer got 21 years then life on licence though."
todayilearned,fh2ckzh,t1_fh1vfdg,1581246261.0,"I was at Liverpool uni when 9/11 happened, the sandwich shop I went to was bricked because it was owned by Muslims.

Except they weren't, they were Sikhs.  They just heard the accent, saw the skin colour and thought 'terrorist'."

Racism aside, most airplane terrorism is committed by radicalised Muslims.  Most school shootings are committed by disaffected white men.

There's nothing wrong with reactions to statistical fact.  It's when we overlay personal bias to those reactions that we get problems."

Steve's realisation that the thing he devoted his life to becoming just wasn't right for him punched me right in the feels."
Unexpected,ffn0xhs,t1_ffmwakv,1580060856.0,Agreed. I'm English and our police are generally great people.  Irritates me no end to see the whole 'don't trust the pigs' mentality superimposed on everyone just cos the US is a militarised dystopia.
