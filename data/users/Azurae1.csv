mildlyinteresting,femouzd,t1_femmb1f,1579265102.0,"Problem with saying pentagon is 5 triangles so it is 5*180 -360 is that the explanation doesn't mention those triangles have to be arranged with just 1 side as an edge of the pentagon. For example a square is 4 triangles but it can also be constructed by just 2 triangles. The latter is more intuitive for most people and suddenly the rule doesn't work anymore. 5 edges or 5 corners would have worked better as an explanation.

Edit: it's even worse for just a triangle. A triangle is a single triangle so your rule gives -180 degrees..."

pics,fehvau0,t3_ep6abu,1579124576.0,"I assume he actually combined two different codes. The colored rows in my opinion are likely computer related because of the colors used (all of them used in electrical wiring), I do agree with others though that its likely not just 1 or 0 where colors are missing. The colored rows seem to be missing significantly less bars which points to less information encoded in the colored rows than the white/black rows, maybe there are dead spaces included to confuse. Might work to ignore every second colored bar and see if the remaining colored/white bars end up being a binary code.

For the white rows I'd go with Morse code. In the white/black rows there are a lot more bars missing than in the colored rows and it seems like the white space could represent long and short Morse code. Didn't have time to transcribe anything yet but I'll check on the weekend.

Maybe someone else will want to try checking the white rows for Morse code until then.

Edit: Another idea could be to separate the rows. All colored in one picture and all white/black rows in another picture. Resulting pictures might make it easier to recognize a pattern"
pics,fehth65,t1_fehnjv5,1579123543.0,"For all we know it's possible that we actually have to ignore every second space. If the 1s and 0s are separated by a color/white and black bar then you suddenly have 1s as well as 0s repeating a different amount of times throughout the whole thing

It's also possible that the relevant information is only where a colored bar is white and a black bar is missing below it at the same time.

The only thing we can reasonably assume is that it's not simply every bar representing a 1 or 0 that doesn't mean though that there isn't binary code hidden within it."

deadbydaylight,fdnj3ud,t1_fdnfcf2,1578586876.0,"For a long time NOED was the only reason survivors did any dull totems and thus slowed the overall gen completion.

Even though we now have Inner Strength we still need NOED as the only real reason to do dull totems as barely anyone runs inner strength and the BP reward isn't much of an encouragement. NOED needs to be strong and honestly I even think totem progress should be slower once it has activated to encourage players more to do dull totems instead of gens.

Unless they finally get rid of lit totems so that survivors have to randomly guess which dull totem is actually assigned to a hex like ruin we need another reason for cleansing dull totems.

I'd prefer there being no visual difference between hex and dull totems as a solution though."

deadbydaylight,fdkv9ka,t1_fdk8yha,1578511872.0,"What I always thought they should do is slow survivor repair speed depending on how much repairing they did in a certain amount of time and just call that debuff 'unconcentrated' with 3 stages, each slowing repair speed by an additional 20%.

Repairing 2 full generators within 4 minutes should give maximum slowdown. Tier 1 slowdown should be after like 40 seconds of repair within 60 seconds. Tier 2 should be somewhere in between. The debuff would slowly tick down while you are not repairing similar to madness tiers.

That way survivors are forced to use their time for something else if they want maximum efficiency. The person being chased should be a different one every now and then and the person unhooking and healing should be a different one every now and then otherwise survivors only repairing are slowed down.

It wouldn't impact gold or green ranks since they are never really efficient but it'd help a lot on red ranks against swf that purely focus gens.

Obviously time and debuff amount are something that would require testing in order to balance correctly but you get the idea."
