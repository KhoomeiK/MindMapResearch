My friend just found out he may have been on the same flight as the dude who landed in Washington, and said he remembers 3 sick people around him at the airport and thinking “dammit this is why I hate traveling I’m gonna get sick again.”  He’s had norovirus and giardia virus before from traveling but came through each just fine.

We have a massive department that spends billions on social issues.  We match donations to charity.  We donate $$$ to whatever org you spend time volunteering with - and we give 40 hours a year for you to take to volunteer, separate from your PTO, maternity / paternity leave, etc.  We have 401k matching and then some, stock purchase plans and grants, a supremely flexible work remote / from home policy, allow you to bring dogs to work a couple days a week, everything. 

Guess what?  People still constantly jump ship within 1-4 years.  Sometimes they get a 3-5% pay raise, sometimes a 40-50% pay raise at the new company, but it’s always a raise.  And it never has anything to do with work perks - it’s the raw $$$$$$$, every time.  MORE MONEY is the name of the game.  And I can’t say I blame them for that, it’s expensive to live here.

If you have truly been wronged and have the data to back up your claims, FIGHT.  Fight not just for your own grade but so the people too quiet or timid to fight for theirs don’t get screwed too.  And if you’re that quiet or timid one thinking you’ll be alone in the fight, trust me - if you got screwed so did many others.  

Don’t accept sub-standard teaching. It sets you up for failure later in life. You or SOMEONE, be it your parents, taxpayers, the military, whatever, are paying tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for this education.  Make it count and demand better results. 

It WILL take hard work and effort on your part but there is no reason to settle for crap just because it’s shoveled down your throat.  

I’ve fought and won and sometimes I’ve fought and lost, but I’ll tell you this - I never regret fighting for my grade.  I DO regret NOT fighting for my grade at times when I accepted a B knowing I should have had an A."

They do not plan on making it out alive, they just want to take as many as they can with them when they choose to commit suicide.  

Charles Whitman felt something was wrong with his brain and demanded it be studied for science later. He left suicide notes to that effect, asking that when he was dead they perform an autopsy on his body.  He had been seeing multiple doctors and psychiatrists to talk about a growing violent impulse he felt with increasing frequency.  After his death they did indeed find a brain tumor, but could not conclusively state it had caused his rampage.  However, a later follow up investigation comprised of a larger team concluded that it was possible the tumor had impacted his fight or flight response area of his brain among other things.

I worked as a welder for several years and have experience with torches.  Soon as I saw the lines running up the ladder that was my guess.  Another thing you have to be careful of, and one of the reasons small “backpack” rigs exist for salvage work and stuff on boats, is the lines themselves not just the tanks.  They’re just rubber usually - and when you’re working on restoring a boat or something there’s lots of sharp edges they can catch on and puncture.  Plus, even sparks and slag can land on them and melt through if you’re not careful."

While I’ll have $100k in savings come March or so, I’d like to leave my stocks and such where they’re at rather than sell for a down payment.  Problem is, opportunities are rare in the areas I’m shopping.  So I might take ~$50k from stocks, $50k from savings, put down $100k, and keep the rest as my 6-month rainy day fund.

I’ve literally met and seen women who start off with “if you can’t afford to buy me a Tesla for Christmas, don’t even talk to me.”  I’ve met women making $150k+ who still insist that any potential dates make at least $150k because they want to move up even more.  The goalposts are always higher.  I very rarely meet any who make more who are willing to date down, even if the potential date is also making $150k+.  I’ve met women who made $200k but still insist on me paying or don’t even bother to attempt to split the check on a date just because “the guy is supposed to pay, I believe in chivalry.”  

There are plenty of studies that prove women constantly try to date up and put a lot of pressure on men to make more and provide more.  They want guys to subsidize an ever-increasing lifestyle, and get away with it because there are plenty of guys that will do it and it only has to work once to be worth it to them.  If you won’t fly them to the Mediterranean first class for a first date, doesn’t matter - there’s someone who will.  

So if you haven’t seen it...congratulations on finding a tiny bubble of friends insulated from it.  (Seriously).  But I’ve seen it first hand numerous times and I’ve seen the same attitude towards it from $15k / year all the way up to $150k / year.  Maybe once you start hitting $500k+ individually each it becomes less prevalent, but...I definitely feel like there is a heavy societal expectation that the man should make more, do more, be more, provide more, constantly.  

That being said, I think it’s shifting too.  Slowly, but noticeably.  People are acknowledging that both partners need to have more say, that relationships are far more two-way-streets than previously thought of (in terms of equality, like both working and supporting each other’s careers.  I’m not talking two way street like “well I pay for the house so she cooks and cleans”).
