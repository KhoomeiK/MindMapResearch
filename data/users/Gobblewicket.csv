Its almost like teaching someone to eat everything they can for 20+ years in an effort to bulk up and then abandoning them with no help in lifestyle correction leads to a lifetime of obesity and health issues.

Comparing bodybuilders to NFL lineman is a bad comparison. Lineman add bulk and strength while having to retain range of motion. They have to weigh enough that the player across from them can just throw them away. While being fast and strong enough to do the same to their opponents. 

A body builder just adds muscle mass with no regard for range of motion, reaction time or actual working strength. 

There is a reason bodybuilders don't play offensive line in the NFL."

Shady isn't our primary back and has been insctive more than active. Damien Williams is our primary back.

Our defense since week 14 has been great. Edpecially in the playoffs against two good teams. Our defense gave up 17 points against the Texans, the other 7 were given up by our offense, 7 of that came on a drive that the Texans started inside our 30 due to snother turnover. And while we give up yardage on the ground, we kept Henry to 70 yards. Not tissue paper by any means.

So the adventurers bought wands of firebolts and started to hunt them down. Only to realize that damaging them with fire just immobilized them.  So they went to a local artificer who sold them tiger's eye gems that functioned as a soul jar. They went back to fighting the ghosts. They rounded up all the ghosts in town but didn't realize their gems had a soul limit. While celebrating with cake at a local bakery the gems exploded releasing the angered spirits who manifested as a massive confectioner sugar elemental. At this point they realized they were the Ghostbusters.
