mildlyinteresting,fdjdhbx,t1_fdhkyq2,1578466296.0,"It‚Äôs really hard to grasp the whole ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù thing (beyond just accepting it at face value like most christians) without reading up on some context (how sacrifices were used/thought of at that time and place). I‚Äôve been trying to read as much extra-biblical lit from the era as i can find, and it‚Äôs pretty interesting. Long story short, we‚Äôre pretty far-removed at this point meaning-wise from what the original followers probably meant imo. A lot of the cultural context that smacks of paganism/polytheism/magic, for example, has been scrubbed, but without that stuff the remaining distilled concepts aren‚Äôt all really organically logical on their own, then a lot of dogma seemed to have developed as a way to kind of reverse-engineer logical consistency.

Idk if i‚Äôm making sense. I‚Äôm basing this perspective off if being raised pretty hardcore catholic, learning latin and elementary hebrew (and just enough greek to get through some prayers), taking a handful of religion and middle-eastern history classes in college, and from having a general interest in mythology/ancient history/religion (and where they overlap in particular). I haven‚Äôt been in college in a little while now, but my new hobby is reading translations of sumarian/babylonian/hebrew/etc. writings to give myself broader context for the stories i grew up with.

The jesus-as-sacrifice thing directly stems from the jewish idea of burnt offerings, of course, but even if we read up on what the heck that means, there‚Äôs another layer to peel back because the jewish idea is set in a world of various religious and groups that offered sacrifices for various reasons and in various ways, and that context matters too. The term was supposed to mean something specific to the people that disciples preached to after jesus died - the term was a way of relating to them based on their own understanding of the cultural/spiritual/magical purpose of sacrifices.

Now we‚Äôre stuck with the word as a descriptor without any of the context. We don‚Äôt generally *make* sacrifices (literal ones with altars and whatnot) as a matter of course. 

Idk if that helps at all but there are my two cents."
