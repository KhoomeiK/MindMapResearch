todayilearned,ffazpzq,t1_ffaw5k6,1579748249.0,I'm a part of the kinky community & sometimes have been able to go to sexy parties. It's a lot of unfortunate looking people. But some not so bad looking people. I enjoy going because when cute girls show up their choice is a guy with a rat tail & a fedora... Or me. I'm an Adonis in the community.

pics,ff3rfcn,t1_ff3pchg,1579547236.0,"What you're implying though is that men PIs are the impartial ones whilst women PIs have some personal agenda, trying to tell the world that men who are older that make babies are more likely to father children with abnormalities. Hell, even what you just wrote seems to have implications of you saying that their research has an agenda. Who said anything about older men with younger women? I didn't.


The truth is that men who are older that father are more likely to make children with abnormalities. Same with women. It doesn't seem to be some kind of agenda to me. Men who are older are breaking down physically as that's what age does. Seems normal to me that their sperm wouldn't be as good either. I don't believe that men & women PIs have different views on this. I'm sure men PI acknowledge that older men's sperm isn't as healthy as well."

And wtf are you implying? Why does it matter if the PI are women? Doesn't change their research."

ftm,fet6f1n,t1_fespkjw,1579372200.0,Did you see the comment from that guy above? He seems to want us to believe that it is impossible to get abs pre-t.
ftm,fes8nj9,t1_feqq90s,1579362600.0,14% to 19% body fat can get defined abs. I have 17% body fat naturally without diet. So I guess pre t I can still get abs. The only problem is having to eat enough protein for muscle gain.
ftm,fes7zt3,t1_feqkcsw,1579362337.0,"I see plenty of women with abs everywhere. If your body fat percentage as a female is 24% or less than yeah, you do have a chance of see some ab development. I may be pre t, but I'm still gonna do my best with what I have."

ftm,fej02yp,t1_fein24s,1579152172.0,Ok. I just said there is no moral obligation to tell people you're trans. But that one should do it because of safety. That's how I feel.
ftm,fei8980,t1_feedw4w,1579132485.0,"Let's be real, it's different for trans women compared to trans women. Morally obligated is a strange way of putting it. A lot of trans people actually answered that they think trans women should in some way tell the person to avoid being murdered. They should do that, but that's not for any moral reasons. As far as trans men... I mean if you haven't had surgery down there then the girl is gonna know when you take your trousers off, best to tell her beforehand if you don't want her to be shocked. But moral obligation? No."

One of my favourite pastimes is going outside as it was snowing(provided it wasn't a blizzard) & just standing there in the silence. The next day it is very pretty to look at as it's still untouched, but the problem is that if the sun is out it can cause snow blindness. Basically, your eye gets sunburnt. The roads can get slippery so you have to be careful. Also, everything gets slippery, I've had to master the art of the ice shuffle walk."

Ruby Rose, symmetrical face, full lips, & piercing eyes, of course she's considered attractive. Cara Delevingne, supermodel, of course she'd be considered hot. Cate Blanchett, Carol was a brilliant film, but she will always be the hot lady of the woods in my heart. But this Shane person... Idk, I'm a millennial(27), do millennial lesbians find her hot?"

AskMen,fcy37ac,t3_ejds1d,1578074131.0,"Gonna give you some advice. If you like a girl, ask her out sooner rather than later. You being turned down for a date will not be crushing for you as you get older, as you should not even be thinking about being in a relationship with someone you haven't even been on a date with. 


You're only 18. So for you it feels like the end of the world. But trust me, as you get older you'll be rejected a lot more. And you'll get over it a lot sooner. And you'll realise that girls are not to be put on pedestals, as they are just people like you. And if they have value, then you must have value too. If you don't feel you have value, do something to improve that for you. Maybe you'll feel as if you have value if you workout or start dressing better.

You'll be ok."
