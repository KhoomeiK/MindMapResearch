SandersForPresident,fcxggwq,t1_fcxe30d,1578062304.0,"Never said killing him was a mistake nor do I disagree, the way in which it was done betrays what I believe America is about, although I fully understand we are Satan in the skies. Why no secret bipartisan meeting? This is a huge deal for our country to break international law. Let it be said that the idea echoed here were said before WW2 in the sentiment that western countries were too easy on the transgressions of Germany. So I see your point but even if you understood a little as to why those wars rage you‚Äôd be blinded by your ignorance."

SandersForPresident,fcxa6i0,t3_ejege6,1578057080.0,"What I‚Äôm really worried about is the cultural significance of the man to fundamentalists within the Middle East. He was martyred and that will stain conceptions of america to an entire generation of Iranians, as well as many Muslims. I‚Äôm not sad he‚Äôs dead, the way it was done was what I believe to be below American standards, although it‚Äôs what they have done time and time again. I‚Äôm sad to see my country stoop so low as to openly assassinate a foreign official.

Edit: originally said ‚Äúun-American‚Äù and I agree this is inherently an american way of solving problems. What I believe to be American values are not what have been represented by the strikes. But I fully understand that is what America has been doing. However idealistic that is idc I‚Äôm going to continue to fight for the America I believe I. Not the one seen today."
