I wen't from being outside every night responding to calls including thefts, assaults, break-ins, suspicious circumstances, transients etc, to a training position. Office, sat behind a desk, answered bull shit phone calls from upper management, paper work, the works. You know what, that raise was not worth it, not in the slightest. Guess what ended up happening? I got canned. Not for performance, I screwed up royally and it's something worthy of a r/tifu I just haven't gotten around to it. That being said, I would have been much happier with my original gig. Instead I felt this need that I had to promote, I had to move up to be *normal*.

We already weren't hanging out much in our late 20's, now that I'm in my early 30's, I honestly don't miss them. I have my own life, they have their own lives. I try and visit at least once a year as most of them have remained in the same place, but guess what? They don't lie in bed missing me and neither do I. We all love each other, we've been super close for over 15 years, but everyone moves on does their own thing. Depending on your job and if you want to do this sort of thing, I recommend hanging out with some co-workers once in a while.

Porter was outside Walter's office on a near weekly basis, she was out and about, people marched for Porter etc. Mimi? Never made an appearance, was NEVER at her office in Irvine CA, honestly all she did was run a few ads. Despite having a ton more cash to work with, Walters flubbed the campaign and Porter won.

I've worked different types of security, but nothing like being a mall cop brings me joy. I love patrolling the property, welcoming guests, waving at friendly retail employees, responding to thefts, assaults, trip and falls, emergencies, all of it. I hung out with an autistic guy until his ride arrived as the crowds where making him nervous. Was one of the most heartwarming experiences of my career, he told me about his beanie baby collection and how some store didn't have the one he wanted but he found something close to it, he was so happy. He just brought so my joy to my day. Experiences like that are why I do what I do. It's also a great way to stay in shape, I log about 13,000 steps a day, and in the past I've done bike patrol. Get paid to work out? Sure thing boss! The only downside of my career is the pay isn't great. But you know what, I'd rather be doing what I'm doing right now than anything else."

unpopularopinion,fdjisak,t3_ellayf,1578472736.0,"Amen, was born and raised in Southern California. I saw first hand the destruction of Orange County and the surrounding areas. What used to be a beautiful area turned to shit with rampant homelessness, break ins, just crime in general. Every time I turned around, the recent budget increase for X problem *coughs in taxes* ended up being rerouted to some feel good nonsense no one cared about besides far left politicians and their limousine liberal donors. There's still some decent areas, heck even residing in Clovis compared to Fresno is a largely better experience even though they are in close proximity. They refuse to build new roads / highways, nothing positive gets done yet everyone needs to pay out the nose in taxes. The 5 freeway going towards LA has honest to God been under construction since I was a kid, and up until 6 months ago when I moved, was STILL UNDER FUCKING CONSTRUCTION. The amount of laziness and incompetence Caltrans gets away with is mind boggling. If you are thinking of moving to CA, be very careful about the area you choose. There are gangs in areas you wouldn't think there'd be, there are aggressive transients all over the place, home ownership is extremely difficult, and if you do end up doing well, you will pay around 40% of that back in taxes. 

All that being said, if you where like me and escaped the clown car that was CA, just remember why you left to begin with, don't force that on your new state and neighbors. I brought none of that CA nonsense with me to AZ, please give TX and other states CA residents flee to the same courtesy."

Every time I turned around, the recent budget increase for X problem *coughs in taxes* ended up being rerouted to some feel good nonsense no one cared about besides far left politicians and their limousine liberal donors. There's still some decent areas, heck even residing in Clovis compared to Fresno is a largely better experience even though they are in close proximity. They refuse to build new roads / highways, nothing positive gets done yet everyone needs to pay out the nose in taxes. The 5 freeway going towards LA has honest to God been under construction since I was a kid, and up until 6 months ago when I moved, was STILL UNDER FUCKING CONSTRUCTION. The amount of laziness and incompetence Caltrans gets away with is mind boggling. If you are thinking of moving to CA, be very careful about the area you choose. There are gangs in areas you wouldn't think there'd be, there are aggressive transients all over the place, home ownership is extremely difficult, and if you do end up doing well, you will pay around 40% of that back in taxes. 

All that being said, if you where like me and escaped the clown car that was CA, just remember why you left to begin with, don't force that on your new state and neighbors. I brought none of that CA nonsense with me to AZ, please give TX and other states CA residents flee to the same courtesy."
