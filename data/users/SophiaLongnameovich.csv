My work provides free pads and tampons though. It's pretty cool. I still bring my own because I have a preferred brand, but having the free ones available at work has saved me many times when my flow is heavier than I was expecting."

I'm used to play-fighting with my three undocked and they will growl and make angry faces but I can look at their wagging tails and know that we're still playing. Sometimes the docked Bostons will do the same and I will get a little nervous because I don't have a wagging tail to let me know we're still playing."

What I learned from my group of social workers is that they'd rather do the following than enter a home with bed bugs:

-have a gun pointed at them
-walk into a meth house
-have soiled diapers whipped at them
-walk through a yard of attack dogs

I've never had bed bugs but they legit terrify me. People go broke trying to get rid of them and still fail."

Especially when I'm with people who only know me from shared hobbies (hunting, snowmobiling, off-roading) say derogatory things about women liking makeup and shoes or whatever. I love makeup, I have a ton of shoes, I'm awesome at baking cookies and a ton of junk that's stereotypically feminine.
