kpop,ffcmewh,t3_esqefs,1579802545.0,"Female - Yejj from Itzy. I don't even stan Itzy, but Yeji is so talented and her presence is absolutely no joke. I thought she was the center because I can't stop watching her in group performances

(Honorable mentions - Yiren from Everglow because she's my baby and Bora from Cherry Bullet because her vocals are ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ) 

Male - San from Ateez. Again, I don't even stan Ateez, but San is so talented. People give him a lot of shit for reasons I'll never understand, because he's far and away my favorite vocalist and his performances are incredible

(Honorable mention - Hongjoong, who imo should have debuted as a soloist because he's highkey carrying Ateez by being an all rounder and having more stage presence than the others, sorry)"

trashy,ff6ysov,t1_ff5jgxy,1579637674.0,"It's not unique though, the contracts usually just state a certain amount of time (usually 3 years) so that the idol's career won't be ruined by dating the wrong person and being wrapped up in their scandals or being distracted while trying to break out in their career"
trashy,ff6ygqg,t1_ff5p7kf,1579637480.0,"The amount of misinformation here is absolutely baffling. Nowhere near the majority ""can't see their family,"" where on earth did that come from?? And most idols start dating after 3 years when they have a stable career so that dating the wrong person doesn't ruin their chances. Also if you think Sulli committed suicide because she ""dated a rapper,"" you have no clue what her story was. She was mercilessly bullied on social media for way more reasons than her boyfriend, who most people just thought was too old for her or didn't ""suit"" her.

Also, trainee debt is mostly a situation for smaller companies. The idea is that the company invests money into their debut and the profits of their music go into paying off those investments until they break even and start making money. If they owed money, they either left their contract early or never made money (and this would have been stated in their contract that they signed). Larger agencies are mostly doing away with trainee debt because they can afford the costs."

kpop,feingad,t3_epbuw3,1579142633.0,"I feel like a lot of people are mistaking ""song you prefer to the title track"" for ""should have been title track."" A couple of these would have made terrible titles because a title needs to grab people and have the signature sound of the group and while a lot of these are good songs, they're not what a title should be.

That being said, Ping Pong by Cherry Bullet would have been a way better title over Really Really. It continues that Q&A sound better and is catchier and has better choreo imo"

San has a lovely neutral vocal color and has proven he has the range to be a main vocalist, and his technique is better than Jongho's. I feel like I'm San's defense squad at this point because I feel so strongly about it.

Also, obligatory Haseul-needs-more-lines comment. She's treated as a subvocalist when she could easily be a lead or main."

IU is a pretty obvious answer I feel like. If you aren't familiar with her, I personally recommend [Palette](https://youtu.be/d9IxdwEFk1c) and [Friday](https://youtu.be/EiVmQZwJhsA)

[Stay](https://youtu.be/eD6tEKRVDWY) by Leebada is one of my favorites, but isn't quite as close as others in this. It's adjacent but more piano based.

[Four Seasons](https://youtu.be/4HG_CJzyX6A) by Taeyeon comes to mind too

[River Run](https://youtu.be/x57kZPtKeqk) by Bambi is another song you might like.

[She's Fine](https://youtu.be/EREAScyThOM) and [We Don't Talk Together](https://youtu.be/ByHNlfmmT-w) by Heize are similar
