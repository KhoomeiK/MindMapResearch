nottheonion,feu9y9x,t1_fetrawi,1579384611.0,">Chill bro. Here it is, with all the statistics you want. Plenty of info on the school to prison pipeline by people who do this for a living. Start at the intro on page 1

Yes there is, I also do this for a living--and what I do specifically is take reports and illustrate the deep systemic problems in studies and citations.

I think I found your reference; I assume you're talking about the ""youth together"" program on referrals for defiance to authority? Woo, a lot to unpack here. First, the evidence within this section is qualitative, not quantitative; meaning they didn't actually measure outcomes at all, simply how individuals felt about things. To their credit, they do actually mention the weakness of their citations. 

*However, to our knowledge, few studies have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the RJ program, using more rigorous research designs, such as using matched comparison groups or the random assignment of experimental and control groups*

But lets dig into their citations for this...[The first one being here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23801074?read-now=1&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents) (You'll need a sub to see it). Now, I've actually read this study before; lets take the first thing that jumps out ""non-Asian students of color"" is a category of reference for them to create this ""racial bias"". The eliminations of Asian students as a ""color"" is a pretty common and extremely ideological tactic of this brand of snake oil--its done because Asians, despite clearly not being white, often get less suspensions than white students and so might reduce the gap in their ""evidence"". (Now we have a term for this when you exclude evidence based on it not matching your ideologically dictated outcome (That racism from white teachers leads to discipline issues)--in other fields this would not be acceptable, unless their assertion is somehow that Asians are ""white"". But...lets skip this...I guess). 

Oh, unfortunately there isn't more to discuss. The paper literally only cites the outcome statistic (More latino/black students are referred) and then goes on to talk about the program that is ""speaking out"" against this and offering a response--but there is no data on that response (Which again at least the main paper admits to). 

So where exactly is your evidence of a drop in suspensions due to this? I'm going to guess you mean the overall results of the restorative practices guidelines placed here. The issue is the report itself illustrates almost 45% of teachers had not yet even been introduced to these procedures within the schools where they had initiatives and that in the vast majority of schools within the district, the amount of participation was not existant..Yet despite this, the drop was consistent across all schools [and has been a trend since 2010](https://greatschoolvoices.org/2018/07/good-news-willful-defiance-suspensions-oakland-need-next/). 


So was this trend due to these practices...or did something ELSE happen during this time period that pushed schools to simply ignore various disciplinary needs? Like a multi-year DoE/OCR investigation which resulted in [quota limits on suspensions](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/10/10/07ocr.h32.html) and resulted in a  [2014](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201401-title-vi.html)dear colleague letter to institute this nationwide? **And I understand the RJ initiative was a response to the DOE directive; but as I showed above, during the drop in rates the RJ initiative was not even implemented in a majority of the schools; so CLEARLY the rates were being forced down with no alternative method of discipline**

And did this drop actually help these schools? Well no, it didn't, their  CAASPP rates are about the same; but the level of [school violence is skyrocketing, its now several times the rate it was before this policy was put in.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55674542e4b074aad07152ba/t/5d79760e23c1aa028e158caf/1568241167705/2018-2019+Violence+Threats+and+Incidents+in+Schools+Report+-+The+Educator%27s+School+Safety+Network+-+www.eSchoolSafety.org.pdf) 

I have zero chill with this, because a bunch of feel good bullshit and snake oil is hurting good teachers. People need to come to grips with the fact that familial problems extend into schools and there is very little schools can do to solve it; these problems are there well before any teacher can change them. (Even the report admits this, as a majority of teachers said the time and resources simply were not there for these policies as they all require parental involvement and most of these kids have major issues at home). This is not the teacher's fault--society can't pass the buck on this one, its time to say ""yeah, this is a problem with this community--not with everyone else"", once we admit that, we can get to work solving it."
nottheonion,fetd6ny,t1_fers0li,1579374114.0,">True. If he's yelling about ""progressives"", we know the problem is between his ears.

I didn't yell about progressives, I said the progressive stack is bad. The progressive stack is not progressive; if anything its the opposite. I am a progressive and always have been; the progressive stack though is destructive to that end, it divides the lower class and sets them on each other--its a tool that's been in service dividing nations since the colonial era. 

Its amazing how the progressive stack and our current hysteria grew right after occupy wall street isn't it? And how all the sudden all the wealthiest companies began campaigns tailored around racial divides in America, and being woke. Very interesting. I wonder who it benefited to have the focus be on that, rather than wealth inequality and corporate malfeasance after 2009..I wonder who it helped when the occupy movement (That I was a part of) devolved into racial bickering and tribalism. 

>One problem is that a lot of teachers in poor non-white neighborhoods are white. A lot of communication issues occur between teachers and students. One training program is helping teachers realize that loud boys aren't ""talking back"" and has reduced the number of students suspended for being ""defiant"". It turns out that some people just grow up speaking more forcefully than others.

Yeah, I'm not talking about loud boys. I'm talking about assault. The person who responded to me clearly works and lives in upper class white neighborhoods, per his own admission. Meanwhile, I live and work around the very people I'm discussing--somehow, though, the disconnected ivory tower view of the world is closer to reality, right? 

As I offered to him; if either of you want to get specific with topics about where you see racial bias, I'll debate you on it. First, lets dive into your claim here, do you have a paper on the program you mentioned about ""loud boys"" and the program used to ameliorate the issue? (I always find its very important to get specific here; because a lot of people have these beliefs based purely in ideology--and when you get down to the facts, a lot of it dissipates. So lets get to them)

(Also, its interesting that to counter my argument you point to significant cultural differences, based on race, being the cause. So your claim here is black boys act significantly differently from white boys? So much so that teachers need special training not to feel threatened; and changing the teachers, not the students, helps alleviate suspensions. Has any research gone into whether that's actually going to help those black boys when they enter a corporate/work culture that is still largely culturally homogeneous? Any long term information on proliferating that cultural divide in a society with a clear hegemony still? Was the study even base don race or was it more a simple gender break down (Given 90% of teachers are now women). Lets put a pin in that and remember it, so we can return after we go over your specific evidence; can't wait to dive into that line of thinking as an illustration of how destructive the progressive stack and this tribal view of a heterogeneous society is, but I can't comment more until i see the evidence/specifics.)"

They are great kids, but the few bad apples are not just bad--they are dangerous, and now that the school acts powerless, nearly all of the teachers are being forced to leave. Its become insane. 

All because society is clutching pearls based on outcome statistics, without ever acknowledging there is significant context in why those statistics look the way they do (The whole school prison pipeline myth, as if school choices to punish students results in their going to prison is an absolute absurdity...As if the school is wrong for noticing the behavior that will eventually land these kids in jail. As if ignoring it helps the kids, rather than simply dooms anyone else around them of having a proper education...As if teachers who CHOOSE to work in inner city schools and with under-privileged youth are somehow so racist they punish those kids unfairly. Its all so fucking absurd).

Edit: lol at the downvotes, what an amazing example of double think. Hate to tell you this kids, but all the above story is, is a specific case of what I'm pointing to.

IAmA,fem9c9s,t1_fem5j66,1579244576.0,">The “crap sources” were trained, licensed therapists surveyed by the study authors, asking about their experiences working with rape victims. The study authors discuss their methodology in the study you linked to. They argue that, by asking expert, experienced therapists to analyze the stories of rape victims yields more accurate and reliable data. This is because the therapists are not involved in the cycles of re-victimization that staff “therapists” (often trained volunteers or certified police counsellors, NOT licensed therapists) are complicit in the system that many rape victims describe as re-victimizing. 


So people not familiar with the processes used within law enforcement were cited by a study as evidence of ""victim blaming"" and what specific questions they were asked (Such as what clothes they were wearing, prior sexual history and sexual response to the assault)?

Yeah, that's the point. The therapists were asked about the **state of the patients**, not what questions their patients were asked OR the specific reason of increased markers of trauma. The study was then the cited by the study linked here to extrapolate that the cause must have been ""victim blaming"" and these inappropriate questions being asked. 

At no point though in that ENTIRE study was evidence given of the reason for increased trauma after contact; simply that there was increased trauma and that contact might have been a reason. So the study using that citation as evidence for what law enforcement specifically did wrong is an INCORRECT usage of the citation. Making the study linked here a shit study, as all the citations show this same weakness.  

>In other words, read the Methodology section of the study you linked to. The “people not involved with law enforcement” were expert, experienced therapists, and they provided opinions based on the testimonies of rape victims. They are not “crap sources”. You have a very clear agenda here, and are arguing in bad faith. Try again.

Oh I have read it, which is why I commented on it. You keep saying expert, experience therapist like its going to help your appeal to authority fallacy--the problem is not the credentials though, nor is it the structure of the study itself--its how the study was used by the study linked here.

Unfortunately all but one is behind a paywall, the one that is shown illustrates a 9% rate in 1998, again from a time period with significantly higher figures. So yes, there is a lot of room for there to be false accusations even if we assume every case within the survey is true on both ends--no serial rapists don't make up for the gap because most rapes are acquaintance based and serial rapists often re-victimize a single victim. (And we're not even getting into how scalars often inflate actual responses and the difficult of interpretation in survey responses--these all create a lot of noise in surveys, its what makes studying this so difficult). 

The fact is the vast majority of reported rapes will never be known one way or another. The assumption that every rape which can't be proven false is NOT a false accusation is just a presumptuous as saying that any rape which can't be proven is false. Human sexuality is complicated, even measuring events like this is difficult--which is why each case is worked as its own thing, within its own context. Despite our newer descriptions there is still a lot of difference in what is considered rape even, you're absolutely right, some guys think 'no' can be said playfully--which to me is shocking in this day and age, but I also know of cases where women legitimately believe they were raped because they regretted their actions (And half the problem with the victimization survey and most surveys is wording is often left to the opinion of the person.

Now, why do I say that? Well, lets dig into one of your studies--[I used one based in America](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315728247_The_Prevalence_of_False_Allegations_of_Rape_in_the_United_States_from_2006-2010)

You can see with this study the problem of what is considered a ""false"" accusation. They go by the ""unfounded/false"" category used by law enforcement/DOJ [within the UCR](https://ucr.fbi.gov/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf). For rape this essentially means that after investigating, the woman literally confesses to lying or there is an overt exonerating piece of evidence that proves the man could not have had sexual contact with her (Like literally he's on video somewhere). 

This means ANY case where a woman does not say she lied, and the man had sex with her, is not considered a false accusation even if later there is overwhelming evidence showing it most likely was not rape. This means the vast majority of cases that are investigated but not proven, are not counted at false, regardless of if they are or are not. 

If you were to use this logic on rape itself, you'd come to the conclusion that about 90% of women are lying about rape--because the only actual rapes we should count are ones with enough evidence to be charged, which is about 2.5-4%."

That last I read, the hypothesis is that Aureus had naturally resistant strains well before humans began using antibiotics, a product of their environment. (This may be the case for most bacteria though, so grain of salt).  

However, even in modern usage, saying sensitive Aureus is a ""rarity"" isn't really correct. Just 2 decades ago,[ 60% of samples taken were still susceptible](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28135900) to Penicillin. And currently [30% of samples are susceptible to it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26924388).

Despite extremely widespread usage of broad spectrum antibiotics (Over-usage, by an extreme degree when you account for farming), the non-resistant strain still exists is significant quantities or is now being selected for again. And this is shocking because of precisely how and why resistance develops in terms of broad spectrum use--these buggers are exposed ubiquitously due to how often we dose for other diseases, and our relationship with staph naturally. Its pretty clear in a non-antibiotic environment the resistant strains would not compete as well, or even varying which treatments the bugs are exposed to, precisely because the immunity affects their fitness so much. (And we just flat out know some mechanisms of resistance would not work as well--they literally have to produce different molecules, and on the scale of bacteria, any such production significantly affects an organism...these things are operating on tiny, tiny amounts of energy.

Futurology,fe4x9sz,t1_fe4hy0m,1578863667.0,"Not sure if I understand the first part, do you mean a case where a bacteria can only be harmful if it is resistant?

And in general, what I mean is that resistance usually requires bacteria spend energy on resisting (Either actively spending energy to create counter-molecules to antibiotics, or passively by say changing something about themselves that makes them less fit for their environment). So naturally they won't do as well as bacteria who do not spend energy on resistance, unless there are actually antibiotics to resist. 

To make an analogy for humans. Imagine if we were to judge a bunch of people by how far they make it walking the desert...All these people were exactly the same (Same level of fitness, same level of strength ect). All these people could carry 50lbs of whatever they wanted. 

Now, most people decided to grab 50lbs of water. A few people though decided to grab 20lbs of bullet proof armor, and 30lbs of water. In most cases, the people who grabbed the full 50lbs of water would make it a lot farther right? In an empty desert, armor is just wasted weight, and you'll have a lot less water to keep going with. However, now imagine every few miles, someone randomly fires a few bullets at our desert travelers. All the sudden, the people who picked only water, tend to not make it nearly as far as the people who are resistant to those bullets. 

Resistance in bacteria works almost the same way."

Futurology,fe3yr8t,t1_fe20ijc,1578854080.0,"If any of those other things happen, you won't have superbugs. Superbugs are a product purely of our ability to fight them. The moment we can't use antibiotics on a large scale, superbugs will go away and ironically any antibiotics you have at that point will become more effective. And that's because most superbugs get out-competed by standard strains when antibiotics aren't used. (Norway does really well at reducing antibiotic resistance, for example, by just being a lot more strict with antibiotics.)"
Futurology,fe3xqld,t1_fe3cqfw,1578853838.0,"Not really, no. Because every trait has a trade off. Even in Antibiotic resistance for example, if we were to stop using antibiotics for a time, eventually most of the resistant strains would die off. Because many of them can't out-compete the non-resistant strains in an antibiotic free environment. They only have an advantage in environments doused with that particular poison.

In Norway, for example--they are extremely strict with antibiotic usage, and because of that, they have a far lower incidence rate of resistant strains. (In fact, some Antibiotics that are fairly useless now in other countries, still have a good chance of working there on domestic patients from what I understand.) So Antibiotics become more effective...the less we use them.  Which means that if we use phages, or other methods of changing the environment, then bacteria who are probably NOT resistant to antibiotics will be selected.  

In short, just by virtue of size and complexity, there are only so many traits a bacteria can take on--its not in the nature of life to be the best in all environments. (One could argue the ultimate purpose of multicelluar evolution was to do precisely that, allow for more complexity and adaptation for single organisms. So as long as a bacteria is...a bacteria, there are constraints on how many different things it can deal with.)"

Here is an article[ from 6 years ago](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/why-no-one-can-design-a-better-speculum/382534/), 3 years before this team began its ""redesign"".

The fact is there are advantages and disadvantages with every material.

AskReddit,fco8gfz,t1_fcnxui1,1577826095.0,">The scope you view intimacy through is severely limited, blind to anything that does not result in an orgasm.

Pot, kettle, all that. 

You call sex a gruesome act, thus naturally you've limited your intimacy to NOT include such an act. Thus your scope is the one that is reduced. 

Someone who enjoys sex can absolutely enjoy those other things, too. A complete picture of love involves all of those things for them, the presence of other forms of intimacy does not detract from sexual intimacy. 

The reason why the lack of sexual intimacy though can detract from love is because they view love as being the entire breadth of these acts. Many people who ONLY had a sexual relationship with no intimacy like enjoying art or conversations together, would also find that to be loveless. Most people see sex as PART of love, and the loss of it is the same as the loss of any other pillar that makes up love.

Sex is not love, but its part of the foundation that creates it for many. And you need something else to replace it if you want to maintain love without it (And that replacement could be the appreciation of sacrifice if one partner forgoes sex to help another recover..)"

Being unable to give so little for your partner's happiness? 

On the same token, going without sex can also be looked at as something you do to help your partner. In the above case, going without sex to help your partner recover can also be love. 

Its all about context. In many contexts sex and love are intimately mixed and removing one absolutely removes the other."

This is very much up to the doctor and how much he is willing to risk (Which is often based on specific experiences and evaluations of the patient, it can be different case by case). Your doctor has a legally recognized responsibility to give you medically prudent advice; not simply do what you want, since he's recognized as an expert you are appealing to for advice. If you get sterilized and 10 years later are angry because you can't have children, it might come back on him--you could say he didn't warn you enough, or pushed a naive 20-something to make such a life altering choice without all the information.

And you can easily see why..Trust is plummeting in old media--specifically because they can no longer control information. Now when they lie, or manipulate information, anyone can go online and bypass them. Also, in addition to this, data storage is also affecting them--how many memes or funny independent creators/blogs make a killing off of simply digging up old clips and articles showing some stunning hypocrisy from the media. They have always preyed on the fact that human memory is more of a summary of events and not precise (How many times have you felt like the media's opinion on something was totally different a few years before but couldn't recall exact, specific examples? Yeah...But now, now with massive indexed archives, you can do just that.)  That is what's destroying their credibility, technology is completely transforming information transfer/storage.
