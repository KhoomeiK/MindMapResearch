history,feubg5k,t1_feoykte,1579384946.0,">For instance, in medieval Europe there was a strong norm against killing members of the nobility. This was not enforced with a punishment (because there was no ""King of Europe"" who could possibly have performed the punishment). Instead, it was encouraged with a reward. Anyone who captured a rich noble could ransom that noble back to his family. This often involved a huge sum of money, so killing a noble was tantamount to throwing away a pile of cash you could have collected for yourself; obviously this is what the nobles wanted, so the system continued. It's a mutually beneficial trade, where you don't kill me and I pay you a bunch of money.

>Other variations included capturing a knight's weapons and armor and holding them ransom, as a low-maintenance version. Weapons and armor are very expensive, so the ransomer just has to charge less than it would cost to replace them. This has the added benefit of not having to feed or imprison anyone while the ransomer waits for his money.

Why didn't this system exist outside of Europe? And why did Basil II simply decide to blind and release Bulgarian POWs instead of ransoming them?"

You can get bonuses for supplying your provinces with certain goods. For example, heavy naval vessels can only be built in provinces which produce or import wood. You can also make money from exporting those goods.

In *Imperator*, you have 4 classes of populations (in addition to the fact that you have to worry about culture and religion): Citizens, Freemen, Tribesmen and Slaves. Citizens (i.e. the elite) pay tax and provide research. Freemen (i.e. non-enslaved plebeians with some rights) pay tax and serve as a military manpower pool. Tribesmen pay a little tax and provide a little manpower, but are the only type available to tribes other than slaves. The quantity of slaves in each settlement determines how much goods it can produce.

The population of each province determines its food consumption too. Sometimes, you might need to import food just to prevent your populations from starving. Countries like Egypt, however, can choose to go down the slave raiding path (well, any country that doesn't have ""Barbarian Traditions"" can go slave raiding eventually), burgeoning its population of slaves to squeeze as much food as possible from its fertile land.

AskAnthropology,fejchip,t1_fdkd5l1,1579167131.0,">Possibly as a result of this development (or very possibly in a sort of  chicken / egg or feedback loop scenario), in humans, sex is not just  about procreation, but about pair bonding and socializing / social  relationships. Most humans have an emotional need / desire for close  companionship, and sex-- in addition generally to feeling good-- can  provide a means of establishing or cementing companionship and those  social relationships. Sexual activity releases hormones ([*oxytocin*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C36&q=oxytocin&btnG=)) in both male and female that are associated with well being, increased trust, and improved social interaction.

Is there an evolutionary benefit to having oxytocin production (and hence social interaction) linked to sex? It seems like a recipe for an overpopulation disaster.

>I mean, I'm not trying to be a dick here, but: **really**? Why even ask this? Are you, in the British parlance, ""taking the piss"" here? Humans like sex. Babies can be a complication. So given those conditions, why throw the bathwater out with the baby?

Isn't overpopulation a concern? Not just to the modern world, but also to societies prior to the [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution)?

Then there's the fact that many religions have a harsh view on sex for pleasure. In addition to that, some religions also have a harsh view on contraceptives and sex education.

So this is why I thought that there would be an incentive to ""throw the bathwater out with the baby"": to avoid the problem of overpopulation and to live in line with religious teachings."

And yet, it’s common to hear the country labeled a “Christian  nation.” The historian Jon Butler [looked at some of the factors that made Christianity such a strong force in U.S. public life](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43751546?mag=christianity-in-the-us), particularly compared with many European nations.   
>  
>Between 1870 and 1960, Butler writes, public Christianity declined  dramatically across much of Europe. That might seem like a natural  outgrowth of urbanization and scientific advancement, with people  leaving the social constraints of their tight-knit communities behind.  But the U.S. did not follow suit. Instead, Christianity grew in power.  
>  
>Butler suggests that one reason Christianity didn’t decline in the  U.S. is that both Protestant and Catholic denominations organized to  keep it strong. They held conferences about the “problem” of religion in  cities, proselytized to new immigrants, and used emerging sociological  tools to their own advantage. In the 1890s and 1900s, the Federation of  Churches and Christian workers surveyed almost 100,000 households in  Manhattan and Brooklyn and used the data to organize congregations to  suit their religious needs.  
>  
>U.S. churches were also different from their European counterparts in their embrace of “therapeutic theology”—an idea that [tied religious belief to worldly success](https://daily.jstor.org/does-the-prosperity-gospel-explain-trump/).  While many Christians criticized this line of thinking as shallow and  self-serving, Butler writes that “therapeutic theology, together with  the American congregational emphasis on social services from education  to child care, probably kept more Christians in America’s pews and  brought more inquiries inside its churches than any other lure or  attraction in the twentieth century.”  
>  
>In Butler’s view, American Christianity’s success was also a product  of gender and racial dynamics. Despite being excluded from most formal  leadership positions, women played a much larger role in Christian  institutions in the U.S. than in Europe. That included running Sunday  schools, organizing temperance groups, and helping to build the growing  Catholic school system.  
>  
>At the same time, many white Christian denominations aligned  themselves with anti-Semitism and anti-black racism in regions and times  where these were popular ideas. Some religious leaders—notably Father  Charles Coughlin—rode bigotry to national prominence. On the other hand,  black Christian leaders and congregations, with the support of some  white churches, formed the backbone of much twentieth-century civil  rights activism.  
>  
>By the 1970s, Butler writes, it’s no wonder that politicians on both the left and right felt the need to [appeal to Christianity](https://daily.jstor.org/televangelism-got-big/)  in a way few European politicians would have dreamed of. Today, even as  the percentage of the country’s population that identifies as Christian  shrinks, public Christianity [remains a strong force](https://daily.jstor.org/does-the-prosperity-gospel-explain-trump/) in our political discourse."

1. [Irene Angelina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Angelina), the second daughter of Byzantine emperor [Isaac II Angelos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_II_Angelos), married [Philip, King of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_of_Swabia).
   1. Her daughter [Kunigunde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunigunde_of_Hohenstaufen), married King [Wenceslaus I of Bohemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_I,_King_of_Bohemia), whose descendants married into (and provided children for) the houses of Luxembourg (Holy Roman Emperors), Brandenburg (who eventually formed Prussia and then Germany) and Hapsburg (who ruled Austria originally, and eventually also the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary, Bohemia, Spain and Portugal).
   2. Her daughter [Elisabeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_of_Swabia), married King [Ferdinand III of Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_III_of_Castile), whose issue included all future Castilian monarchs, and by extension, the monarchs of Portugal, Aragon, France and England (through [Peter of Castile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_of_Castile)'s descendants).
2. As u/NumisAl pointed out, Byzantine emperor [Andronikos II Palaiologos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andronikos_II_Palaiologos) married [Yolande of Montferrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_of_Montferrat) after the death of his first wife [Anna of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_of_Hungary_(1260%E2%80%931281)).
   1. Yolande of Montferrat is also a great-granddaughter of the aforementioned Elisabeth, daughter of Irene Angelina.
   2. The descendants of his first marriage were the ill-fated later Byzantine emperors (and also [Ivan the Terrible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_the_Terrible), who killed his own heir and his remaining descendants were inept and got wiped out).
   3. The descendants of his second marriage brought the [Margraviate of Montferrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margraviate_of_Montferrat) under the House of Palaiologos, and their descendants included most of Italian nobility. Notably, they married into and provided children for the House of Savoy (who eventually united Italy and also intermarried with German royal houses), the House of Visconti (who intermarried with the French royal house, whose member [Henrietta Maria, Queen of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Maria_of_France) married into the House of Stuart and whose descendants include the House of Spencer)."

Except that the conspiracy theorists I encounter aren't fact checking, they just reject any information they dislike without looking into it because they are that distrustful of government and media."
