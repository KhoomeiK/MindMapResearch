dwarffortress,ffml1b2,t1_ffmh3y1,1580056123.0,I build a glass fortress right above the confluence once. Three of the corners were embedded in the cliff and there were fortifications to let in the mist from the waterfall. Then some goblin came shooting at us from atop the cliff before we finish the ceiling.

You can look for other fractal patterns in nature, such as river branches and slime molds. Also just rotating or flipping the map will make it hard to recognize."

That's when population density was low so there's no need to worry about over-exploitation. When population density gets higher we always develop some institutions that have certain power over individual freedom."
worldbuilding,ffew3gy,t1_ffdnb54,1579867981.0,Western industrialized democracies have been doing very well exporting their relatively altruistic culture around the world even after such behavior have secularized. You can certainly have reciprocal altruism enforced my social pressure instead of a government.

todayilearned,fefxyfy,t1_feewho9,1579068946.0,"I don't remember where I read that from but according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria): Despite the widespread modern belief that the Library was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of Ptolemy VIII Physcon, which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to Cyprus. Many other scholars, including Dionysius Thrax and Apollodorus of Athens, fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by Julius Caesar during his civil war in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer Strabo mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of Didymus Chalcenterus in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources."

A lot of societies define adulthood as passing puberty, which makes sense biologically. There are also societies in which men do not get married until 40+. There are usually complex reasons behind varying age of marriage, such as family structure, division of labor, wealth inheritance, dowry, bride price. Forcefully setting an arbitrary number for everyone on this planet without considering the local way of life can lead to immense social problems and is irresponsible."
