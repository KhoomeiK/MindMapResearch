confession,fehhfta,t1_fehgq8j,1579116604.0,"If it didn’t matter then why did you feel the need to defend yourself from a stranger that “doesn’t matter?” Specifically saying you “have friends” who “invite you” to stuff. Yet if you REALLY had good friends that invited you to stuff enough to make you feel comfortable with yourself, you wouldn’t feel the need to defend yourself against someone who “doesn’t know you” because I don’t matter and I won’t know you within days.  But you did."
confession,fehglbp,t1_fehgdnc,1579116109.0,"Bro I don’t fucking know you I don’t give a fuck about you, I can just tell cuz I know people, but your comment from that kid pissed me off, you say “it’s a joke” but jokes are supposed to be funny, you were just a cunt. Words on the internet hurt, evidently. Stay humble."
confession,fehg0f3,t1_fehfvg5,1579115769.0,I know you
confession,feheplb,t1_feheatv,1579115008.0,"If you really didn’t give a shit about what I typed you would’ve just blown it off like I’m so stupid internet stranger, I mean who gives a fuck what I think? But you felt the need to say you have friends who also invite you to stuff, which what, means like 2-3 times a month? Okay lol keep pretending it’ll only make it worse haha."
confession,fehdqw0,t1_fegt14i,1579114451.0,"Why do I feel like you don’t have many friends? Like you have friends but not real ones that invite you to a lot of stuff. Those aren’t real friends you know, those are the friends you tell people you have but they don’t feel the same about you. So you spend most of your time alone telling yourself that you only need a few good friends but in reality it’s just because you aren’t outgoing and people don’t care about you. You can pretend to be someone else on the internet to make yourself feel better, but at the end of the day, the internet is not real life and no matter how long you spend on it, you’ll have to face the reality that you are actually a loser in real life. But don’t worry, you’ll try to ignore this and move on even though it’ll constantly be in the back of your head. You’ll try hard to forget that you’re actually a loser but remember that every time you try to forget you’ll remember this and it’ll only get harder and harder to forget, you won’t forget this, you’ll remember this tonight before you go to sleep lol."

It doesn’t matter if you think you believe it or not, deep down you know it’s happening, you just don’t want to think of the possibility that you will face some serious shit in the next 20-30 yers. Good luck lmao."
onguardforthee,fe13w52,t1_fe08rpc,1578822230.0,"Dude I ducking hate Trump with a passion and believe his strike on the Iranian general was stupid and unnecessary, but how the fuck was that big orange idiot, in all his stupidity, know that a random Iranian decided to blow up a plane. You could argue that it never would have happened if the strike didn’t happen, but in the same sense, Iran already retaliated on the US Air Force bass, at that point both sides displayed capabilities and it was at a stand still. Then bam the plane is shot down....like is it honestly the US’ fault at this point? They can’t control how they were going to respond after the fact, and they didn’t, they were attacked with several missiles. In the US’ eyes, the response to the death of their general had happened, they could not expect a commercial airline to be shot down."

It’ll only create an echo chamber that people we’ll never escape from. Same goes for the other side as well, while the content isn’t necessarily better, people who like trump will only see more stuff about trump and well, we’ve seen how it’s all played out so far...

PublicFreakout,fdi1w77,t1_fdi12wc,1578434259.0,"Hmm, I could be wrong but I thought it had something to do with the colored “cones” in your eyes that allow you to see a spectrum of light.

me_irl,fd3tpmg,t1_fd3q99m,1578161564.0,"I think this whole escalation with Iran is fucking stupid but what does that have to do with volunteering in non-combat positions? You can serve your country and the beautiful world you believe it could be while not be a killing machine. You could be and engineer, medical professional, intelligence, etc. I want to respect people from outside countries and their opinions but it makes it hard when people like you instantaneously jump to another topic (granted a serious one) in favor of shitting on the country without being constructive. There’s nothing bad about wanting to join non-combat roles-in fact I think it’s more respectable to use your brain to support your country rather than a weapon to kill others for some fucking stupid reason like Donald Trump."

gaming,fd09zu6,t1_fczpqxi,1578115833.0,"So while the world is in turmoil we should just turn off our brains and play video games to pretend that the world doesn’t exist for a few hours? Sorry but at the end of the day, you still have to turn off your video game and live in the real world. Having people be aware of that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, we shouldn’t become complacent because “bad things only happen to other people” and “we should just focus on gaming because that’s what this sub is about.” Personally I don’t think I could live at peace knowing that Iranians and American boys are slaughtering each other and here I am, nice and warm, playing my video games and pretending to be in another world. That’s just ignorance."

facepalm,fcz4km7,t1_fcz3bbk,1578093538.0,"What does this have to do with Russia willing to sacrifice everything for Iran? Saddam was a perfect example of how big countries will deal with this situation. Proxy wars, like established cunts such as saddam are used to destabilize countries without directly getting involved into a real war."
facepalm,fcyzfjt,t1_fcywnk4,1578090492.0,Do you REALLY think Putin is ready to throw all of his political power and risk the destruction of his entire fucking country over some poor desert farmers? Cmon use some critical thinking. No country is willing to risk literally ending the world because the USA decided to blow up another (granted powerful) middle easetern? No it won’t happen.

It’s like a comment check list everyone follows whenever a picture of a girl, no one will ever see in real life, shows up on the website.

edit: not even just for girls but for all of reddit. I saw this place called subreddit simulator and it’s literally just a bunch of bots talking to each other. Reddit is so fuckin hive mind that it almost can mirror a bunch of bots talking to each other because of how predictable everything everyone says."
teenagers,fc2mg9l,t1_fc2ipm8,1577367062.0,"Dude why does everyone post the same thing it’s so cringey fuck cmon reddit. You all act sarcastic in the sense that girls don’t go on reddit and it makes me feel like a loser to read all this shit. It’s like all the weirdoes on this website see a girl and you all say the same thing: “a gIrL oN ReDdIt?”, “prEPaRe FoR CREEPY dMs!” or some dude straight up tries to talk to this chick through reddit. Have you guys ever talked to girls outside this app? How could a website represent so much of your real life?"
teenagers,fc2lvpl,t1_fc2heeo,1577366430.0,Why do people all try to talk the same weird way on Reddit. It’s as if comments like yours or the “thank you kind stranger!” are honestly just assumed. This website is wicked cringey.
