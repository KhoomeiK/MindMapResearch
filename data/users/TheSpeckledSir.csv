That means, all in, eliminating a governor as well as flipping a religion can give you a swing of up to 14 loyalty, a very large amount (a size 15 city will be as easy to flip as a size 1 city on that tile would have been, assuming a normal age). Whether or not that amount is overkill depends on the city you're trying to take, but often it will be more than enough.
