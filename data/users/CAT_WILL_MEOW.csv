So if he's working for the police where that's his employer theres a case but if he's just a dog trainer where police contract him out, I'm sorry but that wont get thrown out and that would fall under the good sumeritan, but anything drug related you should still lawyer up they can lessen charges and sometimes get it thrown out, and in the us its diffrent state to state (states have more power then federal) so what I said pertains to my state but could be completely wrong next state over, i almost became a cop and learned pa law but was offered a position in virgina pretty much everything i learned as far as laws goes was useless"
