Omaha,ffebpww,t1_ffe08he,1579842361.0,"I disagree about Omaha being in Decline. Toast + Flywheel are making tons of moves in terms of hiring and developing new areas of town. Applied underwriters is spending massive money to build a new HQ in Boystown. LinkedIn is building a new office and hiring 1,000+. HDR just built that massive building and there's tons more coming up in Aksarben. Facebook and Google built data centers in the area. 

Yea there's a lot of cuts, but there's also quite a bit of growth. Omaha is far from in decline and these kind of shake-ups are happening literally everywhere as technology makes a lot of jobs easier or redundant. We live in uncertain times and it's only going to get worse."

Applied Underwriters is sinking HUGE money into their new HQ into what was Boystown farms and that's redeveloping that area in a big way too. 

LinkedIn is building a new building (I believe an HQ?) on 132nd and Pacific which that whole development is springing up big around the Tri-faith Campus - which itself is something very unique and cool to Omaha. 

HDR just built that huge new building, tons of new shit popping up in Aksarben. 

Facebook AND Google just built some pretty massive data centers out in Papio.

selfimprovement,ffdafxq,t3_eso709,1579816624.0,The first thing is to realize that everyone feels like that sometimes - even the greats. The second thing is just to find something you enjoy and start working at it every day.

New teams are drafted every season and while some core groups stay together, the ringers are forced up or have restrictions placed on them if they want to play down with friends/family (typically it means playing Defense, but I've known one guy wasn't allowed to score unless his team was down by 2 or more goals)."

selfimprovement,ff9mvdv,t3_es9623,1579716321.0,"While I applaud you for your attempt to swing for the fences, my advice as someone who is 33 and is constantly improving - Swinging for the fences is almost a sure disappointment in the making. 

While I think all of those items are definitely DOABLE, I think the way you're going about it needs some correction. 

The biggest thing I can suggest is that you work on making small changes and focus on just one or two things at a time. Let's look at your goals:

**No porn , No Fapping**
A good goal for sure. However going from a chronic masturbator to a non-practicing member of /r/nofap you're going to have a real tough time with this one. I think the key here would be to limit it as much as possible, but make the goal to stop watching the fucked up kind of porn you won't even admit to. Regular masturbation can be healthy (especially for prostate health) and has effects on your mental state for sure. It's the fucked up porn that's causing you a skewed view of women and sexuality that you need to break. 

That said, the key take away here - Don't be hard if you slip. You're almost sure to. Maybe start with - No fucked up porn. No jerking off on the weekdays - that way if you get an urge you can practice will power - You'll be rewarded on the weekend. 

**
Learn Python , Machine learning , and do an internship**

Decent goal, but it lacks specificity. Instead consider - ""Practice Python/Machine learning for X hours per week"". Also you can't control if the internship hires you or not, all you can control is the number you apply to. 

**Gradually running 2 miles a day ( I can run only half a mile presently )**
Not a bad goal, but rather than looking at the end goal focus on the process - You're going to run for X amount of time per day. Before you know it you'll be crushing 2 miles. 

**Gym at-least 3 days a week .**

Similar to the porn goal - it's easy to slip on this one. Consider some small habits and a bodyweight work out so you have no excuse. Something as simple as 25 Burpees a day will push the needle and isn't so taxing you can't still go to the gym.

**Most importantly , practicing self control and discipline and Persistence .**
Again, good goal but it lacks specificity. 



Some other goals I'd look into - Eating one serving of fruit/vegetables a day - and fried shit and juices don't fucking count.

-Read a self development book for a set number of minutes a day (15-20 is a good start, page goals are also good). For recommendations - Atomic Habits by James Clear, literally anything by Jocko Willink. 

-Walk for 10 minutes after meals - Tons of health benefits here and it's so simple to do.

-Every time you take a piss, say one thing you're grateful for. 


Good luck."
technology,ff9lmnx,t1_ff9im44,1579715586.0,I don't think the headline could be any more accurate. Public utilities like power - natural gas don't fall under one organization. Typically it's a handful per area. This would operate in a similar way.
hockeyplayers,ff85968,t3_es5yjr,1579666351.0,"Hard to say without seeing but I'd say it sounds like the pants fit fine. Especially if you're entering into a novice league, the odds you're going to take a hard shot anytime soon are pretty slim. 

As far as cages go, seems like a cage or Hybrid cage is the way to go. Fishbowls do still fog but it can be relatively negated with some tactics, I know a lot of people use them and I never see them fogging up. Personally I just use a cage, but I've thought about picking up a hybrid for a best of both words situation."
hockeyplayers,ff8500b,t1_ff7w8mf,1579666152.0,This is about where I'd be too.
hockeyplayers,ff6sxy8,t1_ff6epym,1579634229.0,I believe the issue is the apple watch/health kit gives data that is not currently available from other APIs.
hockeyplayers,ff6sv98,t3_erw961,1579634184.0,Your app is literally the reason I bought an apple watch. Hopefully Apple gives you a kick back on that some day.
selfimprovement,ff6g1ae,t1_ff6akxm,1579626404.0,Definitely. Building that community will absolutely help keep you going too.
hockeyplayers,ff61jbq,t3_ersrb7,1579616762.0,Nice work. Learning to skate will definitely be the harder of the two. Take some time to look up some ankle strengthening and balance exercises before you start. Even doing something as simple as standing on one leg (make sure to evenly work both legs) for 10-15 seconds a few times a day will pay big dividends when you get out on the ice for the first time.
hockeyplayers,ff6183q,t1_ff5xy7x,1579616526.0,Many professional stunt drivers can drift a car into a parking spot. Doesn't mean a 15 year old should learn that before learning how to parallel park.

Of course wearing regular gloves isn't some magic cloaking device, but when you've got pink gloves people can line you up from across the ice pretty easy."
selfimprovement,ff5cbax,t3_erq263,1579587058.0,"You need to change your mindset first. Making friends isn't really that hard, it just takes work and a willingness to not care. Once you're at that level, just read a few simple books - How to make friends and influence people as well as How to talk to anyone. Both books are decades old but still hold up 100%. Then just join clubs and ask people about themselves - people love to talk about themselves."

Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin totally changed my life though. 

Tools of Titans by Tim Ferris is another good one - It distills hundreds of hours of podcast interviews with highly successful people to just the bombshells and every chapter is only a few pages (or less) so it's a great read for a kindle app on your phone - read it on the toilet, while waiting for shit, before bed, etc."

If you don't have the resources, you just need to use your good days to start trying new things. Once you find something you love and you can start tying things to it you'll be a lot more effective.

selfimprovement,ff43074,t3_er9boi,1579554429.0,"Don't be so hard on yourself for starters. Second, figure out what your trigger is for wanting to watch porn and do your best to avoid those triggers.

Obviously it's a question of happiness over everything, but if you hate your job, and you have something you think you'd enjoy, then figure out how to go for it. That requires a pain period, but if you're smart about it, it won't take long - definitely less time than working at a shitty job forever."

Worst case do some research and get fitted and go to sideline swap or something. $200 brand new skates aren't going to be very quality and they're going to fall apart on you pretty quickly. If new is something you really crave, save up some more cash and get closer to the $400 mid-tier price point. The skates will be much better quality and last a hellva lot longer."

Sadly there will always be those people who take it way too fucking seriously and all you can do is feel bad for them. They take hockey seriously because their day to day lives suck so bad this is the only thing where they feel like they can exercise any control at. It sucks to be on teams with people like this, but I just refuse to validate their anger about anything and keep with the positive vibes.

selfimprovement,fetx4ac,t3_eqllor,1579380958.0,"That seems..unnecessarily complex. I've found that my best success has come from simplifying and reducing. Pick one thing, go at it.

In regards to FOMO, it's all about self awareness. I rarely get FOMO anymore because I know what I enjoy and know that social media makes some things look fun in the abstract of 10 second clips - but it doesn't show the time spent getting to that fun 10 seconds."
selfimprovement,fetaclb,t3_eqhf7e,1579373287.0,"The problem to me is that it seems like you don't really know where you want to go - and that's perfectly fine - most people your age don't really know. 

The first step is to make a list of things you know for a fact you'd hate - maybe that's sports - maybe that's math. Then make a list of things that seem interesting - again maybe that's sports, maybe that's math. 

From there, just start forcing yourself to try things - you can do this at home - Picking up a basketball or a hockey stick, learning basic accounting/finance/investing, etc. You get the idea. Give it a try for a week and if you're enjoying it, keep going. Find groups where you can share the new interest. Maybe that's a rec league basketball or hockey - maybe that's a meet up for local accountants. 

If that seems scary, find some new friends via the internet. Social media is great for this - There's groups on facebook ""Basketball City name"" or ""City name hockey club"" that can help point you in the right direction of where to get started. Often times if you ask where to play people will straight invite you. 

For career fields, get on linked in and find people in your area that do the job you're interested in. Pay for a month of linkedin premium and start cold messaging them - ""Hey there, I see you're ""Job x"", I'm interested in the field and would love to pick your brain. Would you be willing to talk with me over a coffee/beer/lunch at my expense?"" If you ask 10 people you'll probably get 3 responses, with one possible yes. Prep some questions and go meet the person and buy them some food and ask your questions. Each time you do it your questions will get better and you'll get a better idea for the job and what you have to do to get it.

While we're at it though, an argument could be made that Amazon's system is actually considerably better than the alternative - IE: Products are shipped to big Malls that suck huge amounts of electricity.

He's typically 50% higher than I am but we're pretty evenly matched skill wise I think.

hockeyplayers,fem0m77,t3_epunqi,1579235937.0,Life is too short and there's plenty of beer league teams out there. Email the league and mention that it's not a good fit and that you'd like to be placed on another team.
hockeyplayers,fem0f4r,t1_felzqui,1579235772.0,"That seems to be the consensus, thanks for the feedback."
hockeyplayers,felsqu4,t3_epsp8a,1579230011.0,Got a link?
hockeyplayers,felry27,t3_eptgax,1579229454.0,"Depending on your league rules, racial chirps may qualify for a suspension or worse. I think USA hockey made a pretty big deal about it. Even in my beer league insulting someone's sexual preference (whether accurate or not) can get you tossed."
hockeyplayers,fel2erc,t3_epkfbv,1579212586.0,I still wear my 10+ year old skates. They're Nike Bauer something or others. For beer league the difference is negligible I think. I'd prioritize on good shin pads if you were gonna get any new gear. Seems like Shin pad design has changed quite a bit in the last 10-20 years and the new ones cover over the sides a lot better.
hockeyplayers,fel20om,t3_eppny5,1579212341.0,"Definitely go to a hockey shop as intimidating as that might seem. Getting skates that fit good is SUPER important and if you buy wrong and wear them, most places won't take them back so you'll be out quite a good chunk of money.

As a bonus most pro shops will also bake and sharpen them for free the first time. At least where I a live the pro shop prices are similar to online, so buying there is actually cheaper with the free bake/sharpen."
hockeyplayers,fel1v4c,t3_epju92,1579212247.0,"Have you tried any of under armor's cold weather compression gear? 

Seems like it might help at least a little."

Of course, if you were a dad with 2 hockey children you'd cut that down and it'd pay for itself after just a few seasons."
hockeyplayers,fel0932,t1_fek9ytn,1579211288.0,Seems like a consensus. Now I just gotta figure out how to goad people into fighting so I can get that sweet clickbait.
hockeyplayers,fel0754,t1_fek4mgv,1579211255.0,Makes sense. Having the 5-10 second lead up probably keeps it from being too jarring as well. I'm not a big fan of the whole quick cuts and flashy transitions thing.
hockeyplayers,fel0273,t1_fek9ytn,1579211173.0,"Thanks for the feedback. 

I'm thinking right now that I'd like to do 2 gopros behind the nets for games, then just cut back and forth to whichever angle is best so that way the people I play with can watch and analyze and then one on my head for a highlight reel (with the back cameras mixed in when it makes sense). 

I'd have to buy another gopro for that to work though, so I'm just building up and testing for now."
hockeyplayers,fekzq5m,t1_fej7wxz,1579210975.0,"Mostly freelance commercial work, some corporate/non-profit video and a sprinkle of event work here and there. 

Typically getting on event center gigs is pretty easy. The work usually sucks and the pay is crap (relatively speaking) so turn over is pretty heavy - especially when you consider that it's not consistent work."
hockeyplayers,fekzgoi,t1_fekuh2w,1579210817.0,"That's for the big ones that are like 5 or 6 feet IIRC. The hockeyshot one is around $200 shipped - https://www.hockeyshot.com/HS-4-Way-Elite-Passer-p/passing-aid-019.htm

Pro-tip, if you add a few pucks to the order and get to $200 you can get free shipping, so you might as well do that and get some free pucks out of the deal."
hockeyplayers,fej7viv,t1_fej7me4,1579160629.0,I've actually got several subscriptions to a bunch of premium stock music sites thanks to my day job so I think I'm covered there - of course finding music has always been my least favorite part of edits so I'm sure that will motivate the helmet fix lol.
hockeyplayers,fej7jz4,t1_fej6ftl,1579160220.0,Yea I've noticed that. I definitely need to do more tests. Right now I'm thinking having some music + a VO will help cover up the annoying helmet noises.
hockeyplayers,fej68le,t1_fej5dli,1579158578.0,"I'll look into those, thanks! 

[Here's my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRfXllqb0H3vLunNVlmAHKQ) I just started it last week so the first two videos are just POV footage of every second I was on the ice, but I'm thinking that's a bit boring so I tried something different tonight with two gopros and was thinking of maybe making a 5-10 minute edit of the highlights possibly with a voice over.

Eventually I'd like to add some tutorials and work outs and what not. I spend a lot of time every week looking for videos for my beer league team (who probably don't watch them lol) and I've noticed there really isn't a solid option to get all the information you'd want. How to Hockey does pretty good, but even iTrainHockey's subscription site is short in some areas, so I figure hey fuck it, maybe I can fill that gap - or at the very least it gives me another reason to learn and practice."
hockeyplayers,fej58lt,t3_ep8eiz,1579157404.0,"I've thought about doing that with some velcro, haven't tried it yet. 

One thing I did was start wearing thick wool socks over my regular socks to help fill in the boot. Makes the skates fit real tight and now I don't feel like I need to retie them mid-way through the session."
hockeyplayers,fej546p,t1_feiy7xq,1579157264.0,Thanks. That's the way I'm leaning too.
hockeyplayers,fej53qz,t1_fej3a2c,1579157251.0,"That's kind of what I'm leaning towards even though it's more work. I make videos for a living so I know my way around editing, but I'm mostly on the camera department so I don't really edit much. Guess that'll be something I can cut my teeth on and learn a new skill. 

Any suggestions for youtubers you like that I can gain inspiration from? I only know of Hey Stripes and Beer League Bender right now, but haven't searched much."
hockeyplayers,fej4z4j,t1_fej0xo5,1579157107.0,"Check out Synthetic ice tiles too. They're sold in like 1.5x1.5 squares, so they're a bit more modular and easier to carry I think. If you have (or ever will have) a dedicated space you can use they're pretty great. They even have ones you can skate on which seems bonkers to me."
hockeyplayers,feiyab7,t1_feixpmh,1579150600.0,Like $800 if memory serves.
hockeyplayers,feixkmd,t3_epbcky,1579149998.0,"Find a place to shoot pucks and rip ~100 a day as often as you can. There's all kinds of crazy off-ice training options now between synthetic ice, shooting pads and tarps/nets that are actually decent that even with a relatively small space you can set up a spot to practice."
hockeyplayers,feiuxsq,t3_epbetw,1579147895.0,"Thoughts from a former goalie - If you're gonna swing that big the goalie is gonna have all day to set up for the shot and the defense is gonna have a pretty solid chance to strip the puck from you unless you're all alone - in which case why not skate it in for a better angle? 

Keep the blade below your waist, The difference in power is negligible and the speed at which you get the shot off as well as your accuracy will improve considerably. Additionally the chance you biff it decreases as well."
hockeyplayers,feisoou,t3_epcfps,1579146204.0,"You can buy rebounders out there, they can get pretty pricey though. I've seen some people make DIY ones on youtube that didn't cost a terrible amount. If you've got a budget though, Hockeyshot's 4 way passer is probably the best I've seen in terms of size/price. I know there's another company that makes a bigger one, but it was like $400 If I remember right."
hockeyplayers,feii7xl,t1_feibb0w,1579139124.0,"I think that's a good argument for how the league I'm in is run. There's a draft every year, so you're always playing with new folks. I feel like if it was the same guys playing against the same teams you're gonna develop grduges in just 2 or 3 seasons and that definitely can't end well."
hockeyplayers,fehza4s,t1_fehp3kc,1579126895.0,"Agree with this. Lotta great stuff. The guys at Hockeytraining.com have a good youtube as well, but their paid stuff feels a bit lacking to me in terms of hockey skills - if you're looking for actual gym programming though, That stuff from them is absolutely top notch. Their skills stuff needs some work though."
hockeyplayers,fehyzei,t1_fehu7li,1579126714.0,"> ""A person injured during a hockey game does not need to prove either an intent to injure or reckless disregard,"" Gomery said. ""The injured player must simply show that the injury was caused by conduct that fell outside of what a reasonable competitor would expect in the circumstances.""

From the article. I'm not sure if that was the same scenario you're describing based on the judges ruling.

> After sorting through the testimony — some of which she rejected outright as unreliable — Gomery decided that MacIsaac, a defenceman, had deliberately skated toward Casterton at high speed and at an angle where the forward could not see him. MacIsaac further positioned himself to maximize bodily contact with an unprepared Casterton, she found.

I feel like even if it was my team mate, there's no way I'm sticking up for someone going the length of the ice to hit someone."

hockeyplayers,fefjyz8,t3_eomzjm,1579057925.0,"Sounds like your skates don't fit right. I personally like a tight skate and after losing some weight the last few years my skates aren't as tight as they used to be, so I wear a pair of thick wool socks over my regular socks, which helps fill the gap a bit and keep'em snug."
hockeyplayers,fefbve2,t3_eoshdw,1579052918.0,"Are there any adult leagues in your town? Contact them and see what they advise. Here in my town (Omaha, Nebraska) there's a private drop in for literal brand new guys, but its not advertised anywhere. The league also hosts a ""Brand new"" level that starts with 10(?) weeks of practice/instruction before they place you on a team for the rest of the season with other newish players.

If we've got one here, I'm sure they've got one in Ontario."
hockeyplayers,fef7jgp,t3_eoq16b,1579050035.0,"I think it's best to learn to skate on the default blade, then after a season or two go in with a little more knowledge of how you play. The benefit of the profiles is that it helps certain aspects of the game and it's really a personal preference dependent on your position and style of play which you definitely won't have adopted. 

I don't think it's a ""take advantage"" of thing so much as it's just a new thing the pro-shop guy is excited about. It's only in the last few years have there been automatic sharpeners that could do custom profiles. Before recently it was done by hand."
hockeyplayers,fecr6pw,t3_eochu5,1578981562.0,Absolutely you can develop bad habits playing roller hockey - but you can just as easily develop bad habits playing ice hockey and never developing your form.
