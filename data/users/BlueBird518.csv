I just remembered sometimes using shit film cameras growing up and seeing things like double exposures and such. Film can do weird things. Move or wiggle a bit, sometimes things would blur. But I didn't know the technical terms for most of these things and I commented in passing with the best words I had for it."

Edit: apologies if I'm off base but you're coming off very hostile. All I was doing was asking a question in regards to other possibilities besides photo editing. No, I don't know much about photography. But someone else commented, as I shared, that that sort of effect is possible ( as I said, in my previous comment) without editing. And they did so in a way that didn't insult my intelligence. In the future maybe explain things in a way that is helpful so others understand, not in a way that makes you sound like a twat."

Edit: since a photography know-it-all is putting me on blast, I mean ""possible to reproduce this without editing"" since that was apparently not clear before."
ExpectationVsReality,fffcqob,t3_esqont,1579881087.0,A lot of stationary is for collecting more than it is for use. But there are ways to clean the eraser of the dark marks

skyrim,fff46v9,t1_ffeahai,1579875246.0,At least when I go to Rorekstead goats and cows are all floating and drop out of the sky.
RetroFuturism,fff2z1t,t3_et9fqc,1579874300.0,So this thing was able to fly? I don't know much about physics but that is such a strange design I wouldn't have thought it would get off the ground
skyrim,fff2l2c,t3_et1r03,1579873994.0,My current husband is missing. I moved us to a new house and for a while he seemed bugged to stay at the old house while me and the kiddos were at the new one. He was shacked up with my bard seemingly and now both have disappeared all together. I have no mods BTW. So idk if this is something that happens when you do.
