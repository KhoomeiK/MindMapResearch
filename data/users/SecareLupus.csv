AdviceAnimals,fcm7kmf,t1_fcm4yzu,1577766316.0,"Someone else pointed out that smoking decreases appetite, which could be appealing if you're food insecure, and cheap foods that you don't need to know how to cook tend to contain lots of salt, which leads to overeating. It could be that both of these tendencies sometimes are misguided attempts to spend less money, which ultimately fail in the manner you recognize.

I'm not saying personal choices don't play into it, just that I think we are pushed into bad decisions by our circumstances more often than is obvious from the outside, particularly to the recognition of those with greater privilege."

Besides, those numbers are misleading, because money in large quantities doesn't work like money in small quantities.

* How many of those people have put most of their money into private foundations that they still help manage and benefit from, while also cutting off their tax liabilities?

* How much money is technically owned by their companies, despite those companies covering their owners living expenses?

* How much money is invested such that they can take out loans against it, while earning more interest on it than the loan they took out costs, effectively doubling their financial leverage?

Particularly if you buy into MMT, the divisibility of money is not actually a huge impediment to establishing a universal safety net. As one final point, the gdp per capita for the USA in 2017 was just shy of 60k$. If that productivity were efficiently distributed, just think of how much more bottom up consumption there would be to increase that gdp even further..."

AdviceAnimals,fclggli,t1_fclehsj,1577747219.0,"This depends somewhat on brain chemistry. for example, people with untreated ADHD because they lack health insurance to get a script for amphetamines will often self medicate with caffeine or other cheap simulants instead. This wouldn't be the same as an addiction, but you could certainly form a dependency related to maintaining productivity for work. They might not even realize that they're self medicating in this manner, and might just identify it as a craving."
AdviceAnimals,fclfsn7,t1_fclcl9t,1577746782.0,"This comment nails it. I understand why people feel indignant about people not taking care of themselves as well as they could, but I think personal responsibility only goes so far. The reason people don't take care of themselves is because taking care of yourself is more expensive than not, and requires significant time and education, both of which are lacking.

If someone who has only $20 of ""disposable"" income a week chooses to spend that 20 bucks on getting out of their own head a little bit rather than attempting (and likely failing) to save it like a well educated rich person would, I'm going to probably give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they're doing what they need to to survive with their sanity intact. In a world with billionaires, no one deserves to be that poor, and many in the US are even worse off than that, so until society gets its shit together, I'm personally going to avoid blaming the poor for non-optimal decision-making."
