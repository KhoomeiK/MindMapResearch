Turns out it's not easy to drop a 300+ lbs guy, so even surprise attacks rarely took me to the ground. Once you hit there it is honestly more panicky. As for stabbing, I'll never say it doesn't hurt. I just ignore it until I'm safe, then I have time to feel all that fucking hurt. Because it does."

I've seen several videos with guys ignoring stabs, and I've been stabbed several times. It's never stopped me from fighting back, even with a knife stuck in my leg. It still hurt like hell, but someone is clearly trying to make you die, so you don't got much choice."

Adrenaline will numb the pain, and 50/50 you forget about the part where you should be dead. You're now in a life or death situation, so fight, flight, or freeze kicks in. Fight will ignore the pain and keep going, flight runs away(honestly the smart choice, they have a knife), and freeze will probably die. Instinct overrides whatever you think you should do or feel. Hurts like hell the moment you stop fighting though, you know, because knife."
