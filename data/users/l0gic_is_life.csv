He was basically attacked, and pushed down a flight of stairs which killed him. Much of Afghanistan's music is about redemption and life after the wars and such, so naturally when a famous musician passes away, it's recognized on a larger sociopolitical scale. Oftentimes I hear conspiracy theories about his death."

But this is absolute bullshit. My parents (plural, mother and father) taught me and my siblings to have manners and responsibility (I'm male). I read this post, and literally all of it lines up with the past 3 women I've been with. This isn't a rant about men, this is a rant about bad parenting, and that has nothing to do with sex or gender. I can literally swap the gender words in this rant, and it could explain how I'm currently feeling, which is why I'm so cautious with meeting new women.

If you're trying to spread word, you're better off ranting to all parents (not just 'Ladies') about teaching their kids how to take initiative and be responsible.

Though, on a lighter note, I understand your struggle, and hope your man starts to take responsibility."

mobilerepair,ffcgr0x,t1_ffcey39,1579799110.0,"Honestly, though I imagine a lot of people would disagree. 

I actually love the [iFixit toolkit](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Pro-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-307). (It'll come in handy for more things, if this is just one repair). I've had friends who have bought Chinese fakes and duplicates, which is significantly cheaper. But iFixit has a simple lifetime tool policy; if it breaks, they'll send you a new one. (I'm not sure if this is just the business kit, or all of them, but I've never seen anything like that before). 

In my experience, those tiny tools that come with screens are almost always trash. Sometimes they strip your screws. Sometimes they don't even have all the required drivers. Can't really get picks wrong, but often they're quite thick. 

For screens, though it may seem like they're only available online, you'd be surprised if you do a little local research. Purchasing some screens can be cheaper IRL. 

I like to use Fixez.com quite a lot. They have great customer service, and offer great prices, as well as bulk purchasing options with big discounts. Never had issues with the product they've sent me. They also have a wide range of different kinds of parts (laptop/phone/tablet/etc). Definitely buy a 2mm roll adhesive. It's a couple bucks, but it's lasted me years now. 

As a rule of thumb:

-iPhone screens will always be way cheaper, and extremely easy to repair. (Except back-glass– fuck back glass). If your friends need a quick-fix, you can do it.

-Samsung screens will always be ridiculously expensive, unless you go the shady AliExpress route or other weird websites you've never heard of

-Older android screens are a toss up. Usually cheap, but sometimes expensive due to novelty factor.

Good luck! Always remember to do research beforehand (never go into a repair blind). Take note of ribbon cables and sensitive hardware. Watch 3 distinct videos of the repair to make sure you know what you're doing. (iFixit has a lot of step-by-step tutorials on their website, but I'd rather listen to somebody else speak about a repair and share their insight)

And for the love of God

Please. Organize. Your. Screws.
(Buy the iFixit magnetic mat. Comes with a whiteboard marker so you can draw a schematic or take notes - or find something similar/cheaper on Amazon) I know you are confident that you won't lose them, or misplace them, or disorganize them– you will. We all have at least once. Screws that look the same are not the same. Oftentimes they're different lengths and tips, but the difference is too small to recognize."
mobilerepair,ffcete3,t3_esve66,1579797927.0,"Nice. First repair? Also I'd invest in a precision knife/box cutter. You never really know what the packaging is gonna be like, so you don't want to accidentally dig right through the packing tape and into your new screen. Also, from a financial perspective, I generally only use Amazon for urgent repairs (i.e, one-day shipping), but it's always significantly more expensive than other providers, where shipping can be 5-7 days or however long."

For the OS, does this SSD need to be reliable? I have a guy who's willing to sell me a Lite-On 512gb for $15. He said it's used but in working order. Or should I purchase a small brand new 128gb SSD or something close to that.

With respect to data;

Should we stick to multiple WD Red's, or a combination of SSD and HDD. I imagined this in my head much different than how it seems to function in practicality.

We've gained 500 GB of data over five years. So let's say we gain 100gb of data per year. How many drives will we need, and what types?

I checked out the calculator but I don't really understand it. I'm sure it'll make sense in the near future though.

The WD Nas has been sitting around for 5 years. I'm pretty sure harddrives tend to fail after 5 years. What other hardware is in there? It's a WD MyCloud Mirror Home - the old rounded corner one. Are those drives reliable (I doubt it), or should we replace them. Also suddenly, pulling files, saving and updating has been taking longer than it ever has - since this past week. I'm scared it's going to fail soon, but we have a ton of backups on some externals.

Thank you for your help again. I'm starting to realize how things work"
