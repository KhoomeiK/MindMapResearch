SuicideWatch,fev29aa,t3_eqg8kz,1579392264.0,"That's so messed up, they need to stop being passive aggressive pussies and do things themselves if they are so worried about it being done right. The whole coffee thing is so mentally abusive when they could have just asked themselves and made sure that the staff knows it wasn't there to begin with and Ive worked in many different hospice places and coffee is complimentary until you leave the room. They need to start doing things themselves instead of hiding behind you then making you feel bad for not doing it right and I would tell them that. They will most likely disagree instantly if you tell them that but just keep standing up for yourself and repeating they need to stop hiding behind you to get things done until they leave you alone in that area."

Showerthoughts,feeibyq,t3_eondpy,1579034336.0,This I believe is true because my baby boy laughs hysterically in his sleep almost every time it is the best thing in the world

SuicideWatch,fe6k3cy,t3_enyybq,1578893493.0,"The hiding under the bed after a beating begging god for death really hit hard for me because that was my childhood too. Although my dad wasn't an alcoholic he was psychotic and would get into fits of rage over stressful or stupid things and I was the main target. It would last for hours, if I made any noise it would set him off again so always tried to stay so quiet. I never thought to call the police on him, I lived in a small community in the middle of no where so it was frowned upon to get the government involved in family matters. My mom always left when he was like that so I had to face him alone and I always felt so abandoned. Once I turned 19 I got the hell away from my parents and life got better for the most part. I had issues in relationships for years because Im so used to self defense that any tiny arguement with a boyfriend turned into a complete meltdown for me. Then I got pregnant and had my son, as he got older I started noticing my anger towards him for no reason (logical reasons) so I started getting help. I was open to any anger management or parenting classes and took all available classes, was able to cope better and raise him by myself pretty well. I do wish that I was more successful though, I feel that I really have allot of self doubt and depression from what I went through as a child, not ever feeling good enough so I let things go too long. But I have three beautiful kids and a loving husband so things arent too bad. When its bad I just remind myself it will be over, it can't be all the time and one day I will be out of the situation that's the only thing that kept me going as a teen. I really hope things get better for you I really do, I hate that you're going through that but know you deserve so much better and you are lovable no matter what that asshole has done or said to you."

There's a thing called human cryptosporidium that is considered deadly to children, it comes specifically from being exposed to fecal matter, it causes very painful intestinal and stomach issues until the person/ child eventually dies. This is absolutely horrific and disgusting"

insaneparents,fc73o1x,t3_egffl6,1577496677.0,Ugh 42 year old looking woman flipping her own daughter off with a top pony tail and a white belt from the 90s? I don't think her daughter will be missing out on much lol. Why is it the most trashy people think that anyone cares about thier extremist point of views?
SuicideWatch,fc59lwu,t3_eg7ky5,1577450014.0,"I feel exactly the same way, I hate that I have such a perfectly healthy body but messed up brain chemicals that make me so depressed that I feel like i'm wasting my life that someone who is fighting for any type of normalcy would love to have. I try so hard to so stuff and be happy but every day is like waking up in quicksand trying to fight my out just to instantly step into a tar pit of despair, I hate this so much I want it to stop but even the medication isn't working as much anymore."

Showerthoughts,fbl2k4y,t3_edrffg,1576957736.0,"Recently my very big baby boy was born early at 37 weeks, so when his due date came along (he was still in the newborn intensive care unit) I asked the nurse, so is he almost a month old or is he technically a day old? She said that's an interesting question, the day they are born (even early) is the day that gets recorded and development outside the womb starts even though baby missed those days of growing in the womb from being born early. So while he was technically missing those vital days of development in the womb, he still is developing a different way outside the womb with medical and parental assistance."
