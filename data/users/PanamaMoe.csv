pics,ff6t9fp,t1_ff6ix03,1579634417.0,"ARs are typical to military and ex military types because it offers the assault rifle feel but for civilians, your right about that part. It is also the choice for shooters over traditional rifles since they are so easily obtained and inexpensive as well as attatchments and higher capacity magazines being available.

Look, I'm not saying guns are bad but when you dress like a shooter, talk like a shooter, and open carry guns that shooters typically chose do not be surprised when people mistake you for a shooter or at the very least someone with no sense."

pics,ff5dr3d,t1_ff5crfj,1579588612.0,"Ive never seen anyone bring their rifle to a range in anything but a case like good gun owners. As for the police point, the cops know not to shoot at random people or into crowds so that they can play cowboy for the girls.

No reason to have your rifle out like that unless you want people to think you are a loon who can't tell the stock from the barrel."
pics,ff5doqa,t1_ff59zga,1579588542.0,"As an American so would I because no self respecting sane gun owner would just walk around with that kind of rifle in their hands. It is very impractical for self defense and honestly so ridiculous that you will probably get mugged for it before you get to use it. It is a rifle designed for war, where you know who the enemies are and you aren't actively trying to figure out who to shoot in a crowd of people."
TwoXChromosomes,ff5cc69,t1_ff4e8p8,1579587084.0,Hospital racketeering and what are you gonna do? Have your baby in the garage?
Music,ff5bgsf,t1_ff4zg7t,1579586187.0,"Thats gonna be anywhere with open membership. It is a constant balance between being an echo chamber by being members only and being so loud that you can't have your opinions heard by having open discussion. The only medium is moderated discussion and there simply aren't enough people to look at everything or even the bulk of things. Even now I'm gonna get buried and no one will pay my 2 cents any mind, and thats okay because my opinion was probably shit anyway but it's all I got."
todayilearned,ff3h56u,t1_ff2yfyn,1579540922.0,They most likely belived that their threats of hacking and identification wouldn't reach the police as they had some tasty data. When you get strong you forget how vulnerable you are.
science,fel6xoo,t1_fekhsgw,1579215373.0,"People who willingly take psychedelics will be more likely to extract a good experiance from it, hence why when you are spiked it is such a bad thing. Even if it is a reletively harmless substance the trip would more than likely cause issues should you take it unsuspectingly."

todayilearned,fdhg5nh,t1_fdhayn2,1578421940.0,"Darkweb stuff is hard to do and requires arguably as much work as having a dealer so at that point the darkweb isn't as attractive as cash business. Spores yes, but there is still a chance that you get flagged for buying them. That is enough to scare away most kids and people who aren't already into drugs."
todayilearned,fdh9pbl,t1_fdh8jry,1578418409.0,Ease of access is a better bar than you think. Most people stop after the first cause they wake up and realize it would be effort to get it.
todayilearned,fdh5sug,t1_fdh40k3,1578415997.0,"It was for lack of any better terms. Used to be you could find actual drugs, not just legals, spore kits for mushrooms, gun parts that you aren't supposed to have, real deal black market shit that people would just FedEx to you and you would get away with it cause no one was checking for it. There was a pretty big time frame between when the internet was released publicly and how well monitored it is now. Even compared to 6 years ago."
todayilearned,fdh5bgr,t1_fdh4csv,1578415703.0,Pretty much yeah

Futurology,fdgzjjz,t1_fdgt9bn,1578412093.0,Even just pacing works. You can sink yourself in from getting high off 2 hits to smoking the bowl to yourself after a couple days.

worldnews,fdc7hk3,t1_fdbzgy2,1578268609.0,"The only reason our military is ""the best"" is because we throw power at everything. We just flex and assume people will bow, and that is because they will. Having nuclear ICBM powered biceps makes that flex pretty effective. 

Intelligence gathering isn't all that hard either, just time consuming. Anything on a network can be gotten into its only a matter of whether your shit is worth breaking into and we can take pictures from a plane that is flying so high its a spec in the sky, satalite imaging lets us get terrain information. With the amount of people they have on staff figuring out new codes and ciphers is a question of when not if.

The US is just the rich kid who has cool toys and plenty of ""friends"" because it can afford to pay them all. Its like a cartoon."
worldnews,fdc70iy,t1_fdbkj9r,1578268344.0,You aren't wrong. Most super powers have been known for their attempts to keep the people hungry and depressed because those people are easy to control.
