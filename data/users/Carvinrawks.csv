I work with computers. 13 year old me would think that's rad. 

13 year old me would be upset that I never landed a tailwhip on a bmx bike. Although he's be pumped to find out I started riding vert at 15. Hed be pissed I stopped at 16 when I got a car.

Hope I'm not too late. I'm genuinely curious here!

Growing up, we discovered I had an allergy to shellfish.

I'm a 30 yr old adult now. I notice whenever I eat fried foods at seafood places, I end up very painfully constipated the following day. 

This is my only experience with shellfish. This knowledge, and this symptom. 

What can I do to get through/past this allergy safely? I think I'd love a lot of shellfish..."

I was driving, lost in a new city. I was on a road that seemed to be dead straight and several miles long. 

I turned right, at 90 degrees (approx) and went down the street about 4 blocks. 

I got to an intersection and turned right, about 90 degrees. 

I started seeing stores I had seen on the previous dead straight, miles long road. In fact, I was exactly where I had been a few minutes ago. 

I turned right down what I thought was the same street as before (same name), but 4 blocks later, everything was different. 

I had a friend in the car. We may have been smoking marijuana that day, but we can both pretty clearly recall this apparent glitch in the matrix. We were quite spooked when it occurred."

acoustic,fdvafk3,t3_emztix,1578745311.0,"Hm, I'd recommend learning your regular beginner open chords

(Em, E, Am, A, Dm, D, Cm, C, Gm, G)

Learn how to use a pick to strum and pick these chords. Learn how to use your fingers to finger pick these chords. Learn strumming patterns. Learn finger picking exercises and do them using these chords. 

Your fingers are gonna hurt, but it goes away as callouses develop. 

Justin Guitar in YouTube looks like a good starting place.

Songsterr is great for tabs. 

My best advice, though, is to just get inspired to learn how to play something. Hear a song's acoustic guitar part and go ""oh wow... I need to figure out how to play that..."" 

Once you get bit by music in this way, music can become a special friend that will never leave you."
