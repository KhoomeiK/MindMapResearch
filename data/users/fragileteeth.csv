classicwow,fffxq1c,t1_fff3ao7,1579894092.0,I think you're bending logic to play devils advocate on this one. No real human would accept a random summon after a random group invite without any communication as to what it was.
PlayTemtem,ffck5bv,t1_ffbsjj1,1579801179.0,"But devs do get a certain amount of leeway. The game has been out two days and so far they have been incredibly transparent with the problems, the expected timeline for fix, the server load, and the reality of running an mmo. They’ve been incredibly professional and communicative and prompt. There are certain things you can plan and hope you don’t break but when 27k people try to log in at the same time it’s gonna be a different environment than any test scenarios your ran at the office or closed prealpha. 

So imo the people mad about the issues haven’t even waited a week to see. I personally think that they could have had a few more stress tests farther spaced out before their early access release. But honestly that’s exactly what it is, early access. It’s whether or not they’re fixing the issues that makes the anger justified or not."

PlayTemtem,ff7emb6,t1_ff74az3,1579647770.0,I am hoping that with only one realm that they aren’t only using one server. Assuming they’re doing some sort of zone sharding and they have a separate login server then as people start to spread out in the game and everyone isn’t hitting all the same hardware at the same time it will hopefully get better.
PlayTemtem,ff7dp90,t1_ff6vobl,1579647171.0,"They put high pop servers on a queue because even with sharding 50k+ people were trying to play those servers. They opened new servers but people refused to create new toons (even though they had little or no play time on the other servers) leading to lots of complaints about blizzard not fixing the situation which was really just players not wanting to take the alternative. 

Then there was the DDoS attack that shut down login servers on and off for a few days. 

Classic went very smooth all thing considering. They could have handled new realm spin ups better (like not requiring a sub to create a character) but really that was down to a player issue of people refusing transfers even in the first 5 hours of launch."

gamedev,feyzh7r,t3_eqtl0w,1579452398.0,"On the other hand the “donts” are all great ways to convey misses, parries, dodge, etc. any time you want the player to feel awkward about a motion."
Showerthoughts,fetpw8d,t3_eqf40b,1579378170.0,Blue ink is important from a legal standpoint because it makes it easier to tell quickly if something is wet signed or not. A good example is: certain counties will not accept a deed signed in black because in recording it’s hard to tell if it was a wet sign or a copy.
Overwatch,feixq5a,t1_feipvgx,1579150125.0,I mean not every hero is a hero for every rank. I’m not sure if we were watching different dive meta era games but genji was everywhere
Overwatch,feilvgd,t1_fei3q2l,1579141576.0,Maybe at lower elo. The problem is you aren’t just designing the game for the bell curve of players you need to account for balance at the very top as well. Genji is not a player for beginners which is why people at gold and lower groan when someone picks. But buffing him for those ranks would mean giving way too much power to genji players in diamond +
Overwatch,fei20p8,t1_fehhthg,1579128547.0,That’s 168 more damage per clip. That means he can potentially assassinate another back line member with proper positioning. Which is why they are hesitant to buff mobile heroes because their mobility basically doubles their kill potential and also reduces risk because of their ability to escape.
Overwatch,feh2xmu,t1_fegxbnr,1579108042.0,"I’m not sure why this is getting downvoted, it’s pretty spot on. I guess one person is a genji main and disagrees even though he just got a buff"
CulinaryPlating,fefb267,t1_fefa064,1579052385.0,The grainy texture on the right side ceramic glaze. Choosing your plate is just as important as arranging your dish. This is a lovely plate but does not go with this dish imo.

CulinaryPlating,fe6nhyf,t3_engcgr,1578897058.0,I personally do not enjoy this plate for something with a sauce. If that sauce is yummy I want to get it all and not have it stuck in crevices. And also as a very germ conscious person I can only think about how well those crevices were/not cleaned and what bacteria might be enjoying my meal with me.
Games,fe6n54k,t1_fe5ici6,1578896671.0,"You have to be ready to take the case to court yourself if you’re sending the C&D. Such is the whole practice behind patent trolls. They patent one stupid vague thing and then send threats to anyone even remotely close to the patent that they have to license use or go to court and forfeit their product ownership. The troll has the funds of the legal understanding to turn their case into a win and either win ownership and sell to a Chinese shell or the real innovator pays the extortion.

Dogtraining,fe6gxfy,t1_fe3oxaw,1578890558.0,"The reason why this and the comment above are being downvoted is because this is a terribly dangerous mentality for someone who has already identified themselves as a non expert. While the dogs MIGHT grow out of it. They are both more likely to become super ingrained in their behavior and OP will end up with two nightmare dogs. 

The better course of action imo, and likely of those downvoting, is to raise one dog and find a loving home for the other. Then adopt another puppy when the one dog has matured a little more and ALREADY grown out of this phase."
Dogtraining,fe6gkee,t1_fe607ug,1578890246.0,"Some dogs are meant to be only dogs. It’s not a shortcoming of yourself, the breeder, or the litter. But everyone owes it to themselves to find a home for that dog with adults who don’t want kids/other animals."
