The release of 0.12 and Twitch drops were two largely expected and predictable increases (% of existing players returning + some new players) - but the sustained explosion of new players after that wasn't expected.

Also, I'd bet my bottom dollar that it's more about the back-end features such as the flea market/trading, insurance returns, global loot economy, quest tracking, ""matchmaking"", etc. and how scalable those systems actually are. In other words, if those systems were already inherently inefficient, or at least not amazingly streamlined, no amount of new servers would help if and when the scale of those systems increased by a huge unexpected amount."

So I pointed out that nobody uses such a draconian definition and that [cue the quote I posted] throwing around the label of ""cheat"" for any infraction you don't agree with is pointless. If the only way you can label someone as a cheat is to move the goalposts and include acceptable behaviour alongside *un*acceptable behaviour then they're not a cheat and you don't have an argument.

So too is the boxer who repeatedly punches after the bell after every round.

>This paper argues that for the purposes of any sort of serious discussion about immoral conduct in sport very little is illuminated by claiming that the conduct in question is cheating. In fact, describing some behavior as cheating is typically little more than expressing strong, but thoroughly vague and imprecise, moral disapproval or condemnation of another person or institution about a wide and ill-defined range of improper advantage-seeking behavior. Such expressions of disapproval fail to distinguish cheating from many other types of immoral conduct. The discussion shows that we should set the concept aside and assess the moral disapproval implied by claims of cheating by reference to the moral and other principles that underlie the practice of sport.

The aim is to survive and extract from the map and loot along the way. Each raid has a time limit depending on the map (between 30-60 mins). You choose what loadout you take in with you but if you die you lose it (except if you've insured your stuff AND nobody loots your body and extracts with your gear)... SO, you can go in fully geared with a kickass gun, body armour, helmet, expensive ammo, etc, etc... but you could lose it all. OR, you can go in ""naked"", with just your melee weapon that can't be looted so even if you die you wont lose anything but you probably wont survive... or somewhere in between, whatever you want.

On top of this there are scavs which are mostly AI who roam the map and will shoot you on sight. BUT players can also load in as a ""player scav"" (on top of the 8-12 PMCs) after a raid has already started in which they're given a random, usually pretty crappy, loadout. If they extract they get to keep whatever they managed to loot.

Previously, fake notes in general would always fail the UV security measures spectacularly either by having none whatsoever, or really crapp attempts that look nothing like the real thing. But recent fakes we've seen are scarily good. The chequered UV ""50"" is the correct colour combination with crisp sharp edges, the paper is full of the correct coloured UV flecks, foil strip looks authentic, etc, etc."
