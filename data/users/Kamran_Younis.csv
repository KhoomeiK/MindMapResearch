facepalm,ff9rbqa,t1_ff9qjet,1579719386.0,"A white person is someone of European origin tho, so they wouldn't be white. it's funny because here in the UK, my race is referred to as ""Asian"" because my parents are from Pakistan, so ""Asian"" refers to Pakistani/Indian/Bangladeshi. China/Japan etc are referred to as ""East Asian"". Wait so does that mean that Spaniards are considered white too? This race thing is annoying, fuck it, it doesn't mean anything anyway"
facepalm,ff9q4gq,t1_ff9pt5n,1579718470.0,"""Asian"" isn't a race either, so why is that a catagory? Mixed race? But many people can have both parents from Latino descent. None of this makes sense lmao"
