whatisthisanimal,ffgbcuz,t3_etfr9u,1579902496.0,Paper wasp. Clean it and take some benadryl. Hydrocortisone cream will help with swelling and itchiness. If you're allergic to bees (and don't have an epipen) or your throat starts closing call 911.
Celiac,ffff4yj,t3_et9uie,1579882609.0,I'd say the sauce or seasoning.
AmItheAsshole,femxrqo,t3_epwqk2,1579272357.0,NTA and shes tacky AF. That is ridiculous.
bipolar,fegzqro,t3_ep1wfu,1579106117.0,"I suffer from auditory hallucinations, for me it's like a party in the next room. I can't understand it but I hear talking and sometimes music. Depending on where I am it's hard to tell if its real or not but when I'm home alone, I know it isn't real.

What helps me when it happens is putting on headphones and listening to something I know is real.

I have seen things too during some of my worst episodes but it's like people walking by in my side vision, I can't focus on them and see them."
bipolar,fegxuq7,t3_ep273z,1579104948.0,Today actually.
BrokeHobbies,fegxs35,t3_ep3iec,1579104902.0,I feel this in my soul.
MakingaMurderer,fedu1h5,t3_eomuzp,1579019885.0,"Oh, I believe he did it. 

I'd say there's a good split and a lot of fence sitters. The series shouldn't be taken as gospel, do more research on your own. This is good place to start and the other subreddits."

serialpodcast,fe4arck,t1_fe478bm,1578857370.0,"This! 
Once not long ago in a private group on FB unrelated to the serial or any of this I mentioned I believe he is guilty and she actually got all hostile and responded to me because I mentioned /r serialpodcastorigins “Well if you don’t the wherewithal to listen to x hours of undisclosed or watch the documentary”. I’ve done both. If anything they solidified my stance of guilty. And undisclosed is total crap and bias. They’ve been proven liars numerous times. The documentary is gross moneygrab."
bulletjournal,fe3tklv,t1_fdr88vz,1578852706.0,Nice! I hope it was a good dream!
bulletjournal,fe3tjep,t1_fdrx2yz,1578852695.0,"That’s so sweet! I love this style of nature art, I want a tattoo in the style."

bulletjournal,fe3ssjb,t1_fe2szhh,1578852559.0,They are! Very nice heavy metal. I got them on amazon.
bulletjournal,fe0p4zf,t1_fe0nz8y,1578817014.0,Go for it! They’re priced so well! The 2.0 is true a5 size and the other is just a bit less wide. I prefer the true a5.
bulletjournal,fe0j9pn,t1_fe0ewpv,1578814273.0,"Not new but very inexpensive and great quality! Comparable to scribbles that matter. They’re available on amazon. 3 bookmarks, number pages, off white, 120gsm paper and index! The 2.0 is the good one, their original is also good but it’s not true a5, it’s same size a moleskine hardcover. 
I got it because the archer and Olive I wanted has been sold out for a long time."
bulletjournal,fe0ebm1,t3_enilzd,1578811755.0,This is such a cool idea!

I flew on an airplane a few years later and was so mad."
AskReddit,fdl3yes,t3_eluaxn,1578516641.0,"As soon as the sun comes up she walks into my room hollering for food regardless of if her bowl is empty or not, if I ignore her she will get on the bed and start smacking the nightstand lamp so it hits the wall.

Once she has you up and in the kitchen she just eats, and you have to stay until she is done. If you leave she will follow you screaming until you come back into the kitchen.

Shes a social eater."
AmItheAsshole,fd30e72,t3_ejrxcr,1578153536.0,"NTA in any way, shape or form. 
Her behavior is a red flag and rather gaslight-y."
Celiac,fclabua,t3_ehrhc0,1577743247.0,How is it? Is it sweet? So many GF sandwich breads are sweet and I hate it.
serialpodcastorigins,fck7tza,t1_fcbmycy,1577718986.0,I'm guessing they are quoting Undisclosed/HBO aka Rabia and co.
