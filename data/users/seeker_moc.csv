gnome,fdllz0s,t1_fdkze6e,1578527029.0,"Sorry, I'm not OP. I came across this thread while trying to figure out how to disable Gnome-Software. I did the X-GNOME-Autostart thing, and it didn't actually prevent autostart, and I was getting pretty frustrated.

I recently shifted from Cinnamon to Gnome, because I wanted to use Wayland. After the switch, I was extremely frustrated with how user unfriendly Gnome was, giving a user basically no ability to configure the DE. Gnome-Tweak-Tools is essentially neutered. There's a section in the tool for controlling autostart, but all the services are configured to hide themselves from it. There's also basically no customization options outside of installing extensions.

I did figure it out eventually, in addition to adding autostart-enabled=false to the .desktop file, you also have to disable Gnome-Software in search. Apparently search will start Gnome-Software by itself, regardless of any other settings, which is not at all intuitive when trying to disable autostart of a program.

While I did figure this part out, I'm about ready to just give up and switch back to Cinnamon. It seems Gnome is trying to force users to use their computers the way you want them to, and not the way the user wants to. It's honestly worse than Windows. At the least, I should be able to control the top bar somewhat within the GUI without relying on extensions. I can't even control what's in my system tray. I also hate that even after installing the extension to allow icons on the desktop, Gnome still refuses to allow me to drag and drop files to my own desktop.

I appreciate that you responded to my post, and I'm not trying to rant, but instead provide feedback from the perspective of a new user. However, from my perspective there is so much basic functionality missing from Gnome that I'm not sure whether it's worth trying to learn more about it or get used to it."

Setting it to hidden in /etc/xdg/autostart doesn't stop it from autostarting. Putting a .desktop file in \~/.config/autostart and setting X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false doesn't stop it from autostarting.

The only major laptop manufactures that actually test their systems with Linux and provide updates/fixes to ensure it works are Dell and Lenovo (and then only for their business-line laptops).
